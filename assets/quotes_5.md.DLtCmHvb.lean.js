The design added two features, a pressurized cooling system that required considerably less cooling fluid that allowed the engine to be built smaller and lighter, and a number of improvements that allowed it to run at higher RPM. These changes boosted power by over 500 hp and made the 213 one of the most sought-after Axis engine designs in the late-war era. Design and development When the Jumo 211 entered production in the late 1930s it used an unpressurized liquid cooling system based on an \\"open cycle\\". Water was pumped through the engine to keep it cool, but the system operated at atmospheric pressure, or only slightly higher. Since the boiling point of water decreases with altitude (pressure) this meant that the temperature of the cooling water had to be kept quite low to avoid boiling at high altitudes, which in turn meant that the water removed less heat from the engine before flowing into the radiator to cool it. By contrast, the 1940 Daimler-Benz DB 601E used a pressurized coolant system that ran at the same pressure regardless of altitude, raising the boiling point to about 110 ¬∞C. This allowed it to use considerably less water for the same cooling effect, which remained the same at all altitudes. Although otherwise similar to the Jumo 210 in most respects, the 601 was smaller and lighter than the 211, and could be run at higher power settings at higher altitudes, making it popular in fighter designs. The 211 was relegated to \\"secondary\\" roles in bombers and transports. The Junkers Motorenwerke firm was not happy with this state of affairs, and started its own efforts to produce a pressurized cooling system as early as 1938. Experiments on the 211 proved so successful that it became clear that not only could the engine be built smaller and lighter (by reducing the water requirement),Christopher, p. 78 but could be run at higher power settings without overheating. Additional changes to strengthen the crankshaft and add a fully shrouded supercharger for increased boost resulted in the Jumo 211F model, which delivered 1,340 PS (1,322 hp, 986 kW) at 2,600 RPM, up from 1000 PS at 2,200 RPM in the first version 211A. Jumo 213 fuel injector system components in the Technikmuseum Speyer But this was only the beginning. After redesigning the engine block to a smaller external size to suit the increased cooling power ‚Äì while keeping the same 150 mm x 165 mm bore/stroke figures, maintaining the 35 litre displacement of the Jumo 211 series ‚Äì and then further increasing boost settings on the supercharger, the resulting 213A model was able to deliver 1,750 PS (metric hp) at 3,250 RPM. This made it considerably more powerful than the corresponding DB 601E which provided 1,350 PS, and about the same power as the much larger DB 603 of 44.52 litre displacement. Junkers decided to go after the 603's market, and placed the 213's mounting points and fluid connections in the same locations as the 603, allowing it to be \\"dropped in\\" as a replacement, with the exception of the Jumo's standard starboard-side supercharger intake (Daimler-Benz inverted V12 engines always had the supercharger intakes on the port side). The 213A (the main production series, with single-stage two-speed supercharging)Christopher, p. 79 first ran in 1940, but experienced lengthy delays before finally being declared \\"production quality\\" in 1943. Production was extremely slow to ramp up, in order to avoid delays in the existing Jumo 211 production. By the time the engines were available in any sort of number in 1944, Allied bombing repeatedly destroyed the production lines. Production of the A model was limited to about 400‚Äì500 a month for most of 1944/45. A range of advanced versions were also developed during the lengthy teething period. The 213B was designed to run on 100 octane \\"C3\\" fuel, allowing the boost pressure to be increased and the take-off power improved to 2,000 PS. The 213C was essentially an A model with re-arranged secondary equipment (supercharger, oil pump, etc.) to allow a Motorkanone cannon to fire through the propeller shaft. The 213D added a new three-speed supercharger for smoother power curves and improved altitude performance, but it was not produced. Junkers Jumo 213E-1 at Flugmuseum Aviaticum in Wiener Neustadt, Austria The next major production versions were the 213E and the similar 213F. These engines were equipped with a new two-speed, two-stage supercharger that dramatically improved altitude performance. The only difference between the two models was that the E included an intercooler for additional high-altitude performance, while the F model lacked this and was optimized for slightly lower altitudes. The E and F models were in high demand for many late-war aircraft, including the Junkers Ju 188, Junkers Ju 388, the Langnasen-Dora models of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190D and the Focke-Wulf Ta 152H. All of these aircraft used annular radiators characteristic of the earlier Jumo 211 engine installations on twin-engined aircraft, often standardized as Kraftei (power-egg), completely unitized power plant \\"modules\\" for any twin or multi-engined aircraft, much as the Jumo 211 had evolved for earlier aircraft designs ‚Äì but with the annular radiators noticeably reconfigured for better cooling of the more powerful Jumo 213 engine. A further substantial upgrade was projected as the 213J, which replaced the earlier model's three valves with a new four-valve-per-cylinder design for increased volumetric efficiency. It was also to have had a two- stage three-speed supercharger, producing at 3700 rpm for take-off. It would have weighed . There was no time to work this change into the production line before the war ended. Other experimental models included the 213S for low- altitude use, and the turbocharged 213T. Further development of the Jumo 213 was carried out at Arsenal de l'A√©ronautique in France after the Second World War.

He was the leader of Resurrection Band and is currently the leader of The Glenn Kaiser Band. Personal lifeChildhood= Kaiser's older brother and sister left the house while he was still young and his parents divorced when he was nine years old. Kaiser was active in Milwaukee's music scene, starting at the age of twelve, and was a member of more than twelve bands, leading two, before reaching nineteen years of age. Glenn Kaiser was raised as a nominal Lutheran and used drugs before he became a born-again Christian, around the time of his eighteenth birthday. He was quoted as saying: \\"Nothing else gave me so much happiness or sense of purpose until I asked Jesus Christ to come into my heart and become absolute Lord of my life.\\" =JPUSA= Kaiser joined and got involved in The USA Traveling Team of Jesus People Milwaukee (later renamed Jesus People USA ), where he met Wendi, his future wife. Wendi's brother, John Herrin, Jr., and Glenn later became members of the pastoral team before the age of twenty-five. JPUSA is the community that organized the Cornerstone Festival, at which Glenn Kaiser and Resurrection Band have played. =Later life= Glenn Kaiser married former Resurrection Band member Wendi Herrin (born April 8, 1953) in June 1972. Glenn and Wendi have one son, Aaron, and three daughters: Rebecca (husband Timothy), Heidi, and Ami (husband Brian). In 1994 Glenn Kaiser published a book, The Responsibility of the Christian Musician. Resurrection Band thumb Glenn Kaiser's most successful and prominent band is Resurrection Band. Personnel included his wife Wendi, Wendi's brother John Herrin, Jim Denton, who was later replaced by Roy Montroy in 1987, and Stu Heiss. It began in mid-December 1971 as a band of the Jesus People of Milwaukee (part of The USA Traveling Team) and was first known as \\"Charity\\" (the King James Bible term for \\"love\\"). It was a traveling team and a mobile outreach of Jesus People of Milwaukee until the ministry disbanded in the summer of 1972. \\"Charity\\" changed its name to \\"Resurrection Band\\" around March 1972 and the band, as part of The USA Traveling Team left Milwaukee for the last time in early June 1972. They performed on the road for a few months, while loosely based in Florida, before calling Chicago home in early 1973 with Jesus People USA. Though many considered it \\"the devil's music\\", Resurrection Band helped the movement of contemporary Christian music towards blues and rock music. It disbanded, after nearly thirty years, in 2000. Although the band did break up in 2000, they have subsequently reunited for a few shows. Resurrection Band performed at Cornerstone Festival 2008 for the festival's 25th anniversary and also performed at the Chelsea House, a Chicago coffeehouse run by JPUSA. The key members of the band were the same at both shows, but Mike Choby (the bassist for Maron, another Jesus People USA band) filled in on keyboards.

The Kings of Moylurg were a branch of the S√≠l Muiredaig, who were themselves of the U√≠ Bri√∫in Ai who descended from The Connachta. Moylurg is, in Irish, Magh Luirg an Dagda, \\"the plain of the tracks of the Dagda\\". The Dagda was an ancient Irish deity. The kingdom's first king, Maelruanaidh Mor mac Tadg, was a son of Tadg mac Cathal (King of Connacht 925‚Äì956) and brother to Conchobar mac Tadg, who succeeded as king in 967. Maelruanaidh is said to have made a deal of some nature where, in return for abandoning any claim to the provincial kingship, he would be given Moylurg. His dynasty were known as the Clan Mulrooney (later known as Clan MacDermot), cousins to O'Connor, who was then High King of Ireland. This royal connection was exploited to oust the existing chieftains of Moylurg, the MacReevys (Irish: Mac Riabhaigh, later anglicized spelling McGreevy). There are very few clues as to the exact point in time when the MacRiabhaighs (MacReevys/McGreevys) were dispossessed of their ancestral lands by the McDermots or to a controversy which precipitated the action. Modern sources are not much help. Clearly the dispossession occurred earlier than was speculated by Sir Cecil King-Harmon in 1958 (c. 1400) or the Roscommon Herald in 1959 (c. 1300). The statement on the McGreevy Stone in Ardcarne Cemetery (erected in the 20th century, c. 1930) that the MacRiabhaighs (MacReevys/McGreevys) were \\"kings of Moylurgh . . . until 1255\\" may be the most reliable, and also is consistent with the statement by the Irish genealogical authority Edward MacLysaght (\\"More Irish Families\\") that the McGreevys were \\"lords of Moylurg . . . until the 13th century, when they were subdued by, and become tributary to the McDermots\\".

In the 1960s, he played a pivotal role in discovery of a vaccine against rubella virus while working at Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. Plotkin was a member of Wistar‚Äôs active research faculty from 1960 to 1991. Today, in addition to his emeritus appointment at Wistar, he is emeritus professor of Pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania. His book, Vaccines, is the standard reference on the subject. He is an editor with Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, which is published by the American Society for Microbiology in Washington, D.C.. Early life and education Dr. Plotkin was born and raised in New York City, the son of Jewish parents, Lee and Joseph Plotkin, who emigrated from England. He attended The Bronx High School of Science in New York City. While attending Bronx Science, at the age of 15, he read a pair of books that greatly influenced his future education and career choices: Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis and Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif. Deciding to dedicate his life to being a physician and research scientist, Plotkin graduated from Bronx Science in 1948. He then earned his bachelor's degree from New York University in 1952 and went on to earn his MD at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in 1956. Plotkin received his GME from the School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania in 1963. CareerThe Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology= During his time at Wistar, Plotkin worked on several vaccines; chief among them are vaccines for rubella, rabies, rotavirus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). He developed a vaccine for rubella, based upon the RA 27/3 strain of the virus (also developed by Plotkin using WI-38, a fetal-derived human cell line), which was released to the public in 1969. This vaccine led to the eradication of the disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2005. Plotkin, working with Tadeusz Wiktor and Hilary Koprowski, produced a human vaccine for rabies during the 1960s and 1970s. This vaccine can be used as a preventative measure for people who have an increased risk of contracting rabies, as well as a treatment for those who have been exposed recently to the disease, preventing infection in nearly 100 percent of cases. Another vaccine that Plotkin co-developed, working with H. Fred Clark and Paul Offit, is for rotavirus. In 2006, the team's vaccine became part of the U.S. recommended vaccine schedule for babies. In the 1970s, Plotkin led the development of an experimental vaccine against CMV. This vaccine, developed using attenuated CMV, has yet to make it into commercial production. =Other positions held= * 1956: Internship, Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital * 1957: Officer, Epidemic Intelligence Service, United States Public Health Service * 1959‚Äì1973: Instructor, then Associate Professor, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania * 1961: Resident, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia * 1962‚Äì1963: Resident, Hospital for Sick Children London * 1964: Joseph P.

Retrieved on 4 January 2008.Unofficial STAR Page. Retrieved on 4 January 2008. Origins & History STAR started off in the late 1970s as a part-time outfit called the Police Tactical Team (PTT), and was mainly used to contain civil disorder. During the early days, the Police Tactical Team was a motley crew of volunteer officers from the Police Task Force (PTF), who served even on their days off for a monthly allowance of $50. The PTT, although drawing expertise from the PTF, were still limited in their operational readiness, skills and capability. Resulting from the need to provide the Singapore Police Force with a dedicated armed response team, with expertise assistance of Hong Kong Police Force's Special Duties Unit, the UK‚Äôs SAS, Germany‚Äôs GSG9, France‚Äôs GIGN, and America‚Äôs Delta Force, the PTT was re- formed into STAR under Special Operations Command on 1 November 1993. Duties Prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks, the role of STAR was to engage in neutralising armed and dangerous criminals, to resolve urban sieges that may involve hostages or firearms, protection of VIPs and escorting of particularly dangerous prisoners. After the events of 11 September, the unit was also planned to undertake counter-terrorism duties. In 2005, STAR acquired a new maritime assault capability to augment the Police Coast Guard and the Republic of Singapore Navy in dealing with maritime threats.  Known Operations  On 8 May 1998, STAR unit was activated to raid an HDB flat in Chai Chee to apprehend 40 year old Anthony Tan Cheng Lock, a drug addict who earlier shot a police officer in the thigh and stole his service revolver at a housing estate in Woodlands the previous night, after violently resisting arrest. Tan committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with the stolen revolver after STAR troopers breached into the flat. Tan had been admitted into the drug rehabilitation centre five times for drug consumption from 1982 to 1993, and was wanted by Central Narcotics Bureau for skipping mandatory reporting dates under drug supervision order prior to his death. The STAR unit was involved in the arrest of an AWOL and armed National Serviceman, Dave Teo Min, in 2007 at the Orchard Cineleisure Mall without firing a shot.The Strait Times. 9 September 2007. In 2016, STAR responded to two separate hostage situations in the flats of Ang Mo Kio and Sembawang, in which both events involved in stand-offs for more than ten hours. In May 2018, STAR was involved in a covert operation to swiftly apprehend two Taiwanese weapons smugglers who were part of an organised crime syndicate that were busted in Taiwan, but had escaped to Singapore. Selection and training Application to join the STAR unit is open to both public and police officers through the open recruitment exercise every year around October to December. To get the best people for the job, the unit holds an intensive and rigorous selection process. During this process, candidates have to undergo a full-day screening to evaluate both their physical and mental capabilities. After which, they are put through psychological assessments and an interview is conducted by an interview panel. Successful applicants will be notified to undergo a final medical review before starting their intensive two-month training and orientation. During the two months, the candidates will be put through another series of tests to evaluate their capabilities in given situations. Those who make it through the selection week (also known as Hell Week) will then embark on a six-month training course which includes doctrinal and practical sessions in related disciplinary acts. It is also referred to as STAR Main Course, which consists of the basic and intermediate phases of STAR‚Äôs core skills training. The STAR unit is known to have sent officers extensively for overseas training attachments and study visits with different units such as Hong Kong's Special Duties Unit, Israeli Border Guard's Yamam, France's GIGN, Germany's GSG 9, and the Australian Special Operations Group.

Hypostatic union (from the Greek: hyp√≥stasis, \\"sediment, foundation, substance, subsistence\\") is a technical term in Christian theology employed in mainstream Christology to describe the union of Christ's humanity and divinity in one hypostasis, or individual existence.Lewis Sperry Chafer, Systematic Theology. 1947, reprinted 1993; . Chapter XXVI (\\"God the Son: The Hypostatic Union\\"), pp. 382‚Äì384. (Google Books) The most basic explanation for the hypostatic union is Jesus Christ being both God and man. He is both perfectly divine and perfectly human. The Athanasian Creed recognized this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that \\"He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is human from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely human, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although he is God and human, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by his divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of his essence, but by the unity of his person. For just as one human is both rational soul and flesh, so too the one Christ is both God and human.\\" Hypostasis The Greek term hypostasis had come into use as a technical term prior to the Christological debates of the late fourth and fifth centuries. In pre-Christian times, Greek philosophy (primarily Stoicism) used the word.R. Norris, \\"Hypostasis,\\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. E. Ferguson. New York: Garland Publishing, 1997Aristotle, \\"Mund.\\", IV, 21. Some occurrences of the term hypostasis in the New Testament foreshadow the later, technical understanding of the word.There are only five occurrences in the NT, in general used in the sense of assurance, substance, reality. Definition (lit: an underlying): (a) confidence, assurance, (b) a giving substance (or reality) to, or a guaranteeing, (c) substance, reality. The occurrences are: 2 Corinthians 9:4 ‚Äì ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·øá ·ΩëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµŒπ œÑŒ±œçœÑ·øÉ (by this confidence); 2 Corinthians 11:17 ‚Äì œÑŒ±œçœÑ·øÉ œÑ·øá ·ΩëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµŒπ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ∫Œ±œÖœáŒÆœÉŒµœâœÇ (in this confidence of boasting); Hebrews 1:3 ‚ÄìœáŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫œÑ·Ω¥œÅ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ΩëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ œÜŒ≠œÅœâŒΩ (and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds); Hebrews 3:14 ‚Äì·ºÄœÅœá·Ω¥ŒΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ΩëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµœâœÇ ŒºŒ≠œáœÅŒπ œÑŒ≠ŒªŒøœÖœÇ (the beginning of our assurance firm); and Hebrews 11:1 ‚Äì œÄŒØœÉœÑŒπœÇ ·ºêŒªœÄŒπŒ∂ŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâŒΩ ·ΩëœÄœåœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ ·ºîŒªŒµŒ≥œáŒøœÇ (faith is the assurance of [things] hoped). See: http://biblehub.com/str/greek/5287.htm Although it can translate literally as \\"substance\\", this has been a cause of some confusion; accordingly the New American Standard Bible translates it as \\"subsistence\\". Hypostasis denotes an actual, concrete existence, in contrast to abstract categories such as Platonic ideals. In Kierkegaard's Philosophical Fragments, the dual nature of Christ is explored as a paradox, i.e. as \\"the ultimate paradox\\", because God, understood as a perfectly good, perfectly wise, perfectly powerful being, fully became a human, in the Christian understanding of the term: burdened by sin, limited in goodness, knowledge, and understanding.Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 217 (read p.202-217) also see Philosophical Fragments p.31-35 and The Sickness Unto Death p. 132-133 Hannay This paradox can only be resolved, Kierkegaard believed, by a leap of faith away from one's understanding and reason towards belief in God; thus the paradox of the hypostatic union was crucial to an abiding faith in the Christian God. As the precise nature of this union is held to defy finite human comprehension, the hypostatic union is also referred to by the alternative term \\"mystical union\\". Through history Apollinaris of Laodicea was the first to use the term hypostasis in trying to understand the Incarnation.Gregory of Nyssa, Antirrheticus Adversus Apollinarem. Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence ‚Äî a single hypostasis. =Council of Ephesus= In the 5th century, a dispute arose between Cyril of Alexandria and Nestorius in which Nestorius claimed that the term theotokos could not be used to describe Mary, the mother of Christ. Nestorius argued for two distinct persons of Christ, maintaining that God could not be born because the divine nature is unoriginate. Therefore, Nestorius believed that the man Jesus of Nazareth was born in union with, but separate from and not strictly identifiable with, the Logos of God. The Council of Ephesus in 431, under the leadership of Cyril himself as well as the Ephesian bishop Memnon, labeled Nestorius a neo-adoptionist, implying that the man Jesus is divine and the Son of God only by grace and not by nature, and deposed him as a heretic. In his letter to Nestorius, Cyril used the term \\"hypostatic\\" (Greek, Œ∫Œ±Œ∏·æΩ ·ΩëœÄœåœÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ kath' hyp√≥stasin) to refer to Christ's divine and human natures being one, saying, ‚ÄúWe must follow these words and teachings, keeping in mind what ‚Äòhaving been made flesh‚Äô means ‚Ä¶. We say ‚Ä¶ that the Word, by having united to himself hypostatically flesh animated by a rational soul, inexplicably and incomprehensibly became man.‚ÄùSaint Cyril of Alexandria. St. Cyril of Alexandria: Letters. Trans. John McEnerney. Washington D.C.: Catholic University of America, 1987. Print. =Council of Chalcedon= The preeminent Antiochene theologian Theodore of Mopsuestia, contending against the monophysite heresy of Apollinarism, is believed to have taught that in Christ there are two natures (dyophysite), human and divine, and two corresponding hypostases (in the sense of \\"subject\\", \\"essence\\", or \\"person\\") which co-existed.\\"Theodore\\" in The Westminster Dictionary of Christian History, ed. J. Brauer. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1971. However, in Theodore's time the word hypostasis could be used in a sense synonymous with ousia (which clearly means \\"essence\\" rather than \\"person\\") as it had been used by Tatian and Origen. The Greek and Latin interpretations of Theodore's Christology have come under scrutiny since the recovery of his Catechetical Orations in the Syriac language. In 451, the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon promulgated the Chalcedonian Definition. It agreed with Theodore that there were two natures in the Incarnation. However, the Council of Chalcedon also insisted that hypostasis be used as it was in the Trinitarian definition: to indicate the person (prosopon) and not the nature as with Apollinaris. =Oriental Orthodox rejection of Chalcedonian definition= The Oriental Orthodox Churches, having rejected the Chalcedonian Creed, were known as Miaphysites because they maintain the Cyrilian definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature. The Chalcedonian \\"in two natures\\" formula (based, at least partially, on ) was seen as derived from and akin to a Nestorian Christology.Britishorthodox.org Contrariwise, the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards Eutychian Monophysitism. However, the Oriental Orthodox persistently specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches, that they have always affirmed that Christ's humanity is consubstantial with our own, and they thus prefer the term Miaphysite to be referred to as a reference to Cyrillian Christology, which used the phrase \\"\\", \\"m√≠a ph√Ωsis to√ª theo√ª l√≥gou sesark≈çm√©nƒì\\". The term miaphysic means one united nature as opposed to one singular nature (monophysites). Thus the Miaphysite position maintains that although the nature of Christ is from two, it may only be referred to as one in its incarnate state because the natures always act in unity. In recent times, leaders from the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches have signed joint statements in an attempt to work towards reunification. Likewise the leaders of the Assyrian Church of the East, which venerates Nestorius and Theodore, have in recent times signed a joint agreement with leaders of the Roman Catholic Church acknowledging that their historical differences were over terminology rather than the actual intended meaning.[{https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_11111994_assyrian- church_en.html Vatican website]  See also  * God-man (Christianity) * Person of Christ References Sources   Category:Christology Category:Christian terminology Category:Catholic theology and doctrine ","title":"Hypostatic union"},{"id":"1630015","text":"The Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885 was a law passed by the Parliament of Queensland in that year to prevent overcrowding and urban degradation in cities and towns in Queensland, especially in Brisbane. The law is a noteworthy example of early efforts by Australian legislators to control urban development and avoid the appearance of slums. The Act prevented the subdivision of land by speculators and developers into lots less than 16 perches (). As a result, most residential development in the older parts of cities such as Brisbane and Rockhampton consists of detached homes on rectangular lots, usually with a frontage of half a chain or , and a depth of two chains or . Frontages of 10 metres necessarily prevent the development of terrace houses, which was the predominant form of mass housing in other Australian cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Newcastle. Many middle-class and wealthier land owners preferred to buy two adjoining 16-perch allotments and build a larger house straddling the two lots. One Member of the Legislative Council reportedly argued for a minimum lot size of 32 perches ‚Äî that is, ‚Äî during debate.Queensland Legislative Council Hansard 1885, 21 October. Retrieved 6 March 2016. While the Act made Brisbane and other Queensland cities a more attractive and less overcrowded place to live and raise families and allowed each household to grow a garden, it did have its disadvantages, the main one being that the resulting low population density made it more expensive to provide urban services such as sewerage, paving and street lighting. As a result, Brisbane was the last major city in Australia to be comprehensively sewered, and unpaved laneways were common in the inner city until the 1960s. Nor was Brisbane spared the horror of slum development - suburbs such as West End and Red Hill were long known for their general poverty and low socio-economic status, even if they weren't as overcrowded as similarly impoverished districts in Sydney and Melbourne. The Act was rescinded in 1923 and has been replaced several times by more up-to-date town planning legislation such as the current Planning Act 2016. However, Brisbane and other Queensland cities are still noted for their low population densities compared to those in the southern Australian states.

France In French government ministries and Parliament, a huissier, which can be translated as usher, is an employee who provides general service to the minister or assembly (transmitting messages, ensuring that doors are closed or open appropriately, handling ballot boxes, etc.). Traditionally, they wear a chain around the neck, because their original function was to lock and unlock doors. Before the Revolution, the title could be a court office in the household of royalty, as a type of valet de chambre. Switzerland In Switzerland, huissier is the French equivalent of German Weibel (also Amtsweibel), the term for a ceremonial office in Swiss cantonal and federal governments, parliaments and courts of law. At the federal level, the office is known as Bundesweibel, at the cantonal level as Standesweibel for governments, Ratsweibel for parliaments and Gerichtsweibel for courts of law. Some cities also have the office at the communal level (Stadtweibel). Swiss huissier in their official capacities wear ceremonial roles with the heraldic colours of the entity they represent, Bundesweibel in red and white, cantonal weibel in cantonal colours (Standesfarben).

LeFevre (born October 6, 1944) is an American Christian rock singer best known for his work with his band Mylon and Broken Heart. He is a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. He currently travels around the United States, ministering, teaching and singing. He sometimes can be seen on television networks, such as TBN and Daystar. BiographyEarly years= Born on October 6, 1944 in Gulfport, Mississippi into the pioneering Southern gospel family, The LeFevres, Mylon was the youngest son of Eva Mae and Urias LeFevre. When he was old enough, he began to sing and play guitar with the group. As a teen, LeFevre was expelled from a private religious high school when his father took him out to be with the family while they performed at a local concert. At 17 years old, while in the Army where he was paid $84 per month, he wrote his first song, \\"Without Him\\". While stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, the LeFevres were performing at a gospel convention in Memphis. That weekend, LeFevre hitchhiked over 600 miles to get there. Onstage, singing \\"Without Him\\", he did not know that Elvis Presley was there. After the concert, Elvis asked to meet LeFevre. Shortly thereafter, Elvis recorded the song for his album, How Great Thou Art, and within the next year, over a hundred artists would record his song.Moscheo, Joe, The Gospel Side of Elvis, New York, Hachette Book Group, USA, p.105 (2007) According to LeFevre, writing the song took about twenty minutes and produced an initial royalty check of approximately $90,000. With that money he purchased his first car, a Chevrolet Corvette, one of many sports cars he would own. After leaving the army, LeFevre became a member of the famed Stamps Quartet (1966‚Äì1968). In 1964 LeFevre released his first solo album, New Found Joy, on Skylite Records. In 1968, LeFevre would release Your Only Tomorrow. LeFevre wanted to write and sing contemporary music that gives glory to God, but there seemed to be no place for his music‚Äîor his longer hair and long sideburns‚Äîin his family or the Church. His first mainstream album, entitled Mylon, We Believe (Atlantic/Cotillion Records 1970), is considered by some to be the first true \\"Jesus Rock\\" album. LeFevre took the classic song, \\"Gospel Ship\\", setting the familiar southern gospel melody to rock & roll tempo.Collins, Ace, Turn Your Radio On, The Stories Behind Gospel Music's All-time Greatest Songs, Grand Rapids, MI, Zondervan, (1999), p. 62. =1970s‚Äìearly 1980s= In 1970, LeFevre signed with Columbia Records, and formed the \\"Holy Smoke Doo Dah Band\\" with Auburn Burrell and J.P. Lauzon on guitar, drummer Marty Simon, Tom Robb on bass and keyboardist Lester Langdale. From 1970 through 1980, he recorded and performed with Eric Clapton, Elton John, Billy Joel, Duane Allman, Berry Oakley, Little Richard, & the Who,Brant, Marly, Freebirds: The Lynyrd Skynyrd Story, New York, Watson-Guptill Publications, (2002) p. 76 among others . The album On the Road to Freedom was produced by Alvin Lee and recorded in George Harrison's studio with Ron Wood, Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Mick Fleetwood, & released in 1973 . Lee & Harrison are also contributing writer/musicians. In 1974, he appeared as a fill-in vocalist on several tracks for The Atlanta Rhythm Section's album Third Annual Pipe Dream. LeFevre started getting high to deal with the stress and to fit in. His drug use escalated to a near-fatal overdose of heroin in 1973. So LeFevre committed himself to a drug treatment program that year. Seven months later, LeFevre came out clean. In 1976 LeFevre met Danny Davenport, a promotion exec with Warner Bros. and the two of them became friends. That friendship escalated into a Warner Bros. contract which yielded two albums: Weak at the Knees and Love Rustler. In 1980, LeFevre attended a concert by the CCM group, 2nd Chapter of Acts. Their long hair and music showed that they weren't concerned with outward appearances, but with issues of the heart. Buck Herring, the group's leader, led the people in prayer and LeFevre prayed along and submitted to Jesus as the Lord of his life. =Broken Heart era= LeFevre quit secular rock and returned to his home church at Mt. Paran Church of God, in Atlanta‚Äîwhere he worked as a janitor, while attending Bible-study classes. His first challenge was to get out of his music contract which, according to the terms, could only be broken \\"by an act of God\\". LeFevre's attorney argued that being born again is an act of God and won the case. In return for release from his contract, LeFevre agreed to give up all future royalties on his songs, publishing and recordings. In 1981, he started a Christian band called The Gathering Ground Band, later to be renamed Airborn with some musicians he met in the Bible study: Dean Harrington (lead guitar, vocals, percussion), Don Woods (drums/percussion), Kim Klaudt (bass), Mike Adams (rhythm guitar) and Michael Milsap (keyboards). In 1982, the band changed their name to Broken Heart. A small offshoot gospel label from MCA Records known as Songbird released Broken Heart's first album Brand New Start (1982), with members: Dean Harrington, Kenny Bentley (bass/vocals), Stan Coates (keyboards/vocals), Ben Hewitt (drums/percussion), and Mike Adams. Others musicians who helped with the first album were: Joe Hardy (bass, guitars, percussion), John Hampton (drums), Ed DeGarmo (of DeGarmo and Key; organ/synthesizer), Jack Holder (guitar/background vocals), Phil Driscoll (trumpet/flugelhorn). Later members of the band included: Tim Huffman (guitars/vocals) and Scott Allen (rhythm guitar/vocals). Other musicians who helped with other albums over the years were Kerry Livgren (of Kansas), Phil Keaggy, Ed Zimmerman, The 2nd Chapter of Acts, The group Sevenfold, and Jimi Jamison. Two more albums came out in 1983, More and Live Forever (recorded at Six Flags Over Georgia). Over the next 10 years, the group released 10 albums and traveled over a million miles. In 1987, the group attempted to cross over to mainstream rock by rechristening itself 'Look Up!' and releasing an album with Columbia Records. The album contains a retooled updating of \\"Peace Begins Within\\" from the We Believe album and a cover of DeGarmo and Key's \\"Love is All You Need\\". Over the years guitarists Scott Allen, David Payton, Trent Argante, and Skip Benicky and keyboardists Stan Coates, Paul Joseph, and Marshall Pratt were also members. Many members of Broken Heart have gone on to become solo artists, music producers, worship leaders, pastors, and teachers. In 1987, the band received a Rock Album of the Year GMA Dove Award for Crack the Sky. That same year, they received a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance by a Duo, Group, Choir, or Chorus. About this period (1982‚Äì1991), LeFevre said, \\"I was a Christian musician who preached a little, worshiped a little, and rocked a lot.\\" Then in mid-1989 he suffered a heart attack on a tour bus while touring with White Heart. Doctors advised him to stop touring, but against the physicians advice LeFevre completed his scheduled obligations and finished his concert tours. Mylon and Broken Heart would continue touring through 1990 to support Crank It Up. They disbanded after the tour completed. =Solo career to present= In 1992, LeFevre inked a solo recording deal with Star Song Records and began releasing material that was less musically \\"edgy\\" than past offerings. His first release for them, Faith Hope and Love, included guest appearances from Carman, 4Him, Michael W. Smith and Steven Curtis Chapman among other popular Christian musicians of the day along with Broken Heart bandmates Bentley, Hardy and Hewitt. Following his heart attack, LeFevre increasingly turned to preaching and teaching as his vocation. He and his wife Christi minister in about 75 churches a year. He has also spoken at motorcycle rallies, NASCAR owner/driver chapel services, NFL and NBA chapel services, and in Russia, Australia, Canada, the Philippines, the Cayman Islands, and Mexico. His most recent music release is 2003's Bow Down, produced by his son-in-law Peter Furler of the Christian band Newsboys. The couple's home church is Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark, Texas.Mylon LeFevre Ministries homepage, section \\"Mylon was Inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame\\".

The Dulo clan was a ruling dynasty of the Bulgars. The origins of the Bulgars and Dulo clan are not known precisely, and there are many theories about their origin. It is generally considered that they - or at least the elite caste - is intimately related to the origin and activity of the Huns and Western Turkic Khaganate. Particularly, it is said that the Dulo descended from the rulers of Great Bulgaria, which was founded by Khan Asparukh's (679‚Äì701) father on the steppes of Ukraine. This state was a centralized monarchy from its inception, unlike previous Hunno-Turkic political entities, which were tribal confederations. The royal family and rulers of Old Great Bulgaria (632‚Äì668) and the first half of the First Bulgarian Empire (681‚Äì1018), in their prince lists (Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans) claimed through Irnik, who was probably related to or was Attila's son Ernak himself, or at least of Attilid descent. During the pagan period, the succession of clan leadership was based on traditions brought over to the Balkans from the Eurasian Steppe, which include the rulers' divine ancestry. At the head of the clan was the Khan, who reigned as the head of state, military leader, and probably high priest of the Bulgar god, Tangra.  Research history  Most of what is known about the clan is written in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans. The Nominalia lists as the first ruler mythical Avitohol, who lived 300 years and descended from the Dulo clan. Josef Marquart and many other historians identified Avitohol with Attila the Hun. Steven Runciman considered the connection possible, but suspicious and unimportant if the link between Irnik-Ernak is confirmed. Runciman considered the name Avitohol meaningless and its biblical origin more convincing. He considered that the missionaries were spreading Old Testament stories around the Eurasian Steppes, as well the story of Japheth, the ancestor of Eurasian people, which easily modifies into the Latin name Avitus (ancestral; grandfather) and Turkish Awit (ancestor) it derives from. Runciman considered Avitohol to be a distant mythological ancestor. Ivan Biliarsky considers that both Avitohol and Irnik were only mythic figures of the historical personalities. According to him the Nominalia shows that the clan memory and genealogy important to Central Asian peoples was likewise significant to the Bulgars, as well the cosmological understanding of the history, as the Avitohol and Irnik were mentioned in the category of the creator and founder, the mythological divine ancestor-creator represented in the reincarnation of the cultural hero within time cycles. Jean W Sedlar considered the Attila connection justly doubtful, and argued the possibility of a steppe dynasty which produced Hunnic rulers like Attila may have also produced rulers for the Bulgars. The second listed ruler is Irnik, who lived 150 years and also descended from the Dulo clan. It is generally considered that in the Nominalia under Irnik was considered the third son of Attila, Ernak. Vasil Zlatarski thought the identification between Irnik and Ernak pointless, and they were two different persons and families. Zlatarski pointed out, which points Runciman considered to be indisputable; if Irnik was Ernak, then both Ernak and Atilla belonged to the Dulo clan, whereas, actually, no source mentions Dulo clan in connection with them; according to the Nominalia Irnik ruled from 437, i.e. several years before the death of Attila in 453, which is impossible. Due to be assigned a reign of 150 years, Runciman considered the inaccuracy of the date of accession as venial mistake. Kurt (Kubrat; c. 632‚Äì665), a member of the clan, revolted against the Pannonian Avars and founded the Old Great Bulgaria on the territory of modern Ukraine. During the second half of the 7th century his sons split up the Bulgar royal family and spread over Europe, from the Volga river to the shadow of Matese mountains: Bezmer (Ukraine), Kotrag (Volga Bulgaria), Kuber (Balkan Macedonia), Asparukh (Danube Bulgaria) and Alcek (Sepino, Bojano, Isernia). In the Nominalia the Bezmer (c. 665‚Äì668) was the last Dulo ruler on the northern side of Danube river (of the Old Great Bulgaria), while the Asparukh (c. 681‚Äì701) was the first from the southern side of the river (First Bulgarian Empire). He was followed by Tervel (c. 700‚Äì721), and the last ruler of Bulgaria from the Dulo clan, Sevar (c. 721‚Äì737). According to Theophanes, in 761 or 762 the Bulgars \\"rose up, killed their hereditary lords and set up as their king an evil- minded man called Teletzes, who was 30 years old\\". Historians usually interpreted the testimony as evidence of a massacre of the previous dynasty (the Dulo clan), and the rise of a new leader with no connection to the previous regime. =Origin= The exact origin is obscure. Some researchers consider that the origin of the clan probably was Turkic. This proposition was suggested by Mikhail Artamonov, and was prompted by Lev Gumilev (1967), implying there may be made an association of the Dulo clan with the five Duolu (or To-lu) tribes of the Western Turks. The First Turkic Khaganate (552‚Äì581) was during the G√∂kt√ºrk civil war (581‚Äì593) divided into Western and Eastern Khaganate. The Western was led by Onoq (ten arrows), the five Duolu and five Nushibi tribes. Many modern historians consider that the first historical Bulgar ruler Kubrat belonged to the Dulo clan of the Western Turks - the so- called alliance Onogurs Bulgars. Some historians have even identified the Western qaghan Moheduo (K√ºl√ºg Sibir) with Organa, the maternal uncle of Kubrat. Accurately or not, it still points to the rivalry between the Bulgars, led by Kubrat from the Dulo clan, and the Khazars, led by the Ashina clan. Omeljan Pritsak further considered the connection of the name of Dulo clan with the name of the old Xiongnu ruling house Â±†ÂêÑ Tuge (in Old Chinese d'o-kl√¢k). This association could further prove the link between Xiongnu and Huns (as well Huns and Bulgars). Peter B. Golden surmises that the Xiongnu tribal surname Áç®Â≠§ Dugu (< d'uk-kuo) or Â±†ÂêÑ Tuge (< d'o-kl√¢k) possibly reflects underlying Turkic *Tuƒüqu or *Tuƒülaƒü \\"tribe of the tuƒü?\\"Golden, Peter B. (1992) An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples. p. 58 yet still considers the Turkic association as speculative. Mercia MacDermott claimed that the Dulo clan had the dog as its sacred animal. MacDermott considered that the Bulgarian expression preserved to this day \\"he kills the dog\\", in the meaning \\"he gives the orders\\", is a relic of the time when the Dulo Khan sacrificed a dog to the deity Tangra in the name of the whole community. Some modern Bulgarian scholars, the most prominent of them, namely Peter Dobrev, argued that the Turkic names of the animals in the Bulgar calendar (also found in the Nominalia) show that the Turkic peoples had borrowed these words from the Iranian language (Bulgars). However, according to Raymond Detrez, this theory is rooted in the periods of anti-Turkish sentiment in Bulgaria, and is ideologically motivated. As such the proto-Bulgar language (of the group which established the state of Bulgaria), was claimed to be of Iranian language although it is generally accepted it was Turkic of Oghuric branch and related to modern Chuvash. Aleksandar Burmov noted that the medieval writers under various names mentioned Huns and Bulgars, and some authors mentioned them as separate ethnic categories. The cases of mixing information for Bulgars and Huns in some authors, as well as possible rapprochement of the names Avitohol - Attila and Irnik - Ernak, do not give reason to draw a line of equality between the two ethnic groups. According to Burmov there is no historical evidence that the Bulgars and Huns lived in the same territory. Burmov, Peter B. Golden, Gyula N√©meth and Panos Sophoulis concluded that claiming of Attilid descent shows the intermingling of European Huns elements with newly arrived Oƒüuric Turkic groups, as the number of evidence of linguistic, ethnographic and socio-political nature show that Bulgars belonged to the group of Turkic peoples. =Etymology= B. Zhivkov emphasized that Dulo and Nushibi were tribal confederations, and not ruling dynasties. B. Simeonov derived Dulu from Turkic dul/tul (big, powerful, giant; war horse), and saw Dulo as partly Slavicized form. The *Dullu Simeonov derived from Old Hunnic dul + lu (mounted, horseman). According to Peter B. Golden, no such Hunnic word is attested. According to G. Clauson, Old Turkic tul denotes \\"widow, widower\\". Golden, citing Lajos Ligeti (1986), wondered if Dulo resulted from Slavicism of Turkic title Yula.Golden, Peter B. (2005) \\"Khazarica: Notes on Some Khazar Terms\\", in Turkic Languages, ed. Lars Johanson, Harrassowitz Verlag, p. 215 Even so, all hypotheses P. B. Golden considers for now as speculative.

Early years Alers (birth name: Rafael Alers Gerena ) was born in the city of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, to Don Ignacio Alers and Do√±a Anita Gerena. He received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. The love that he developed for the Puerto Rican Danzas came about at a young age because of the influence which he received from his musically inclined family. He received his first musical instructions from the maestro Juan F. Acosta. With Acosta he learned to play the euphonium, a wind instrument which is essential in the execution of the danza. He also learned to play the trombone and tuba.Music of Puerto Rico Musical career Upon finishing his musical instruction, Alers went to play for various national and international bands and Symphony Orchestras. Eventually, he formed his own band and recorded the Puerto Rican danzas composed by Juan Morel Campos, Manuel Gregorio Tav√°rez and √Ångel Mislan. In 1933, Alers was the conductor of Carmelo D√≠az Soler's Orchestra, which had a daily segment in a radio program. Alers took charge of the orchestra upon the death of D√≠az Soler and in 1935 he felt the inspiration to compose a danza. He composed what was to become his greatest danza and named it \\"Violeta\\" and the following day he played it on the radio. The public's acceptance and demand for the danza was so great that the radio station started a \\"Write the Lyrics to the Danza\\" contest. They were looking for the right lyrics to go with the musical melody of the danza. The lyrics written by Antonio Cruz Nieves, from the town of Cata√±o, was selected as the winner. Alers married Catalina Rold√°n and had four sons (the eldest now deceased) and three daughters. \\"Violeta\\", which was the title of his danza, was officially dedicated to his youngest daughter.Danzas 8 Danzones from Puerto Rico One of the recordings by Rafael Alers was: 8 Danzones from Puerto Rico. *\\"Conversaci√≥n\\", 3:12 *\\"Delia y Bel√©n\\", 3:03 *\\"El Torbellino\\", 3:08 *\\"Estrella de Borinquen\\", 3:16 *\\"La Borinque√±a\\", 2:27 *\\"No me toques\\", 3:17 *\\"Recuerdos\\", 3:15 *\\"Sara\\", 2:38 Later years Alers was named conductor of the ROTC band of the University of Puerto Rico, which in 1946 included a young man by the name of Julito Rodr√≠guez, who was to become a professional musician himself. Alers became the first Puerto Rican to compose the music score for a Hollywood movie when he was hired for such a task for the 1956 movie \\"Crowded Paradise\\", directed by Fred Pressburger.IMDB Many of his recordings were released in 1960, in a set of three volumes, titled \\"Rafael Alers: Danzas\\".

HistoryPrior to 681= In 680 CE, Bulgars crossed the Danube and invaded lands now part of modern-day Bulgaria, which was at that time largely inhabited by Slavic farmers. The Bulgar army was led by Asparukh, who according to Byzantine chroniclers was one of the five sons of Kubrat, the Onogur chief who revolted against his Avar rulers and succeeded in uniting the various Bulgar groups living north of the Black Sea. When Asparukh and his warriors entered the region south of the Danube, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine IV was upset and led an army to prevent the Bulgars from remaining there. The Byzantine expedition against the Bulgars ended disastrously and after defeating the imperial forces, Asparukh forced the nearby Slavic tribes to pay tribute to him, while leaving their tribal organization intact. As a result of this defeat, the empire was forced to sign a treaty recognizing the Bulgar state in 681. Despite the area having been for some time under the de facto control of various Slavic tribes, the emperors of Byzantium had kept up the fiction that the area was still imperial, as up to 681 no true state had replaced imperial rule. This was the first time that the Byzantine empire officially acknowledged another state in the Balkans. =681-893= Pliska was the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire between 681 and 893 AD. According to a Bulgarian chronicle, it was founded by Khan Asparukh. At its greatest extent, it had an area of 21.8 km¬≤ and was surrounded by earthen ramparts. A smaller stone fortification was built inside these ramparts and this contained a palace and buildings belonging to the aristocracy. While Pliska experienced nearly a century of growth following its selection as the capital of the new Bulgarian state, this was not a peaceful era. The Bulgars and Byzantine Empire were in an almost constant state of war during the eighth century and into the early ninth. Emperor Constantine V oversaw nine campaigns against the Bulgars between 741 and 775, and Emperor Nikephoros I's campaign in 811 resulted in the burning of the royal residence in Pliska. In this last instance the emperor led a massive army to Pliska in retaliation for the Bulgarian capture of Sardika and massacre of its garrison that occurred in an earlier set of hostilities. The Bulgarian leader Krum was not prepared to face the emperor's army and thus abandoned Pliska and the Byzantines plundered the palace and town there and burned it to the ground as it was largely at this time made of wood. Soon after, the invaders were driven out by Khan Krum (see Battle of Pliska). Later in the ninth century, during the reign of Boris I, the pagan temples in Pliska likely began to be converted to Christian churches. In 886, Boris founded the Pliska Literary School which was moved to Preslav when Boris later relocated the capital. When Boris fell seriously ill and retired to a monastery, his son Vladimir succeeded him and attempted to reestablish paganism. During this period (889-93) the large stone basilica at Pliska built under Boris was heavily damaged. Boris left his monastery to overthrow his son, and after succeeding, relocated the capital to the nearby town of Preslav which seems to have been a centre of Christianity in the state. Following this Pliska's relevance in Bulgar governance steadily declined until the Bulgarian state was destroyed by the Byzantine general turned emperor (when he murdered the previous emperor Nikephoros Phokas) John Tzimiskes. He defeated the Russian forces that had occupied Bulgaria and annexed the Bulgarian lands all the way to the Danube, ending the rule of the first Bulgarian state in these territories. During this Russian and Byzantine war over Bulgaria, Pliska was destroyed between 969 and 972 and was not rebuilt. Archaeology of Pliska Ruins of the early medieval city of Pliska, the first Bulgarian capital The construction of an earthen rampart was started shortly after the Bulgars settled in the Pliska plain (it has been suggested that these embankments may not have been built all at once), and the territory inside of this is known as the Outer Town, which consisted of multiple groupings of modest cottages with space in between for flocks of livestock and horses. This seemingly unusual layout may have been chosen as the Bulgars had been nomadic prior to building their capital at Pliska, and when they began to cooperate with the local Slavs (which formed a strong majority of the new state's population) a mixed pastoral and agricultural economy developed. The Inner Town, which was likely built later in the settlement's existence, consisted of a palace, basilica and aristocratic buildings inside a stone fortification. The Inner Town was surrounded by the Outer Town which was in turn surrounded by the earthen rampart. Overall, far less is known about the layout and contents of Pliska prior to the conversion to Christianity than afterwards. No stone buildings have been dated with certainty from before the Bulgars converted to Christianity in 864/5, and many wooden buildings (which were initially presumed to have come from the pagan era) also appear to have been built later on. It's not clear which buildings were built in the decades immediately after 681. When the earthen rampart was built, Pliska had a very low population. Dimitrov's map based on the 1989 to 1991 dredging works in the Outer Town suggests that there were no more than six to twelve hamlet sized settlements there, while there might have been thirty or so by the tenth century. Pliska fortress plan There is however still no plausible explanation for why the earthen rampart and ditch built around Pliska encircled such a large area. A few areas appear to have been inhabited by people who provided services or took part in craft production for the palace centre, and agriculture clearly took place within the earthen rampart around the Outer Town. There was clearly a fair amount of open ground inside the earthen rampart. Henning concludes that the settlement was initially built for military and strategic reasons, and could not really be considered a typical city (with all of the associated trade, production, and population) until the period after Bulgaria converted to Christianity in 864/5. Most of the stone architecture in Pliska was built between this conversion and eventual Byzantine conquest of the city in 971. The buildings from this era show a clear Byzantine influence in their design and function. For example, a 4 kilometre-long canal fed a large brick cistern that moved water from the Kriva river to the Inner Town via ceramic pipes. This cistern had attached rooms containing private baths. Only certain parts of the archaeological site of the city have been properly investigated. One of the most thoroughly researched is the Asar-dere area just to the west of the stone fortification surrounding the Inner Town. Four clay-made furnaces have been discovered in this area, suggesting that Pliska possessed a specialized pottery making capabilities and an urban economy at some point during its development. Initially, such finds were interpreted to show that early on the settlement relied upon pastoral and agricultural activities, and later developed sophisticated craft techniques. This interpretation was further supported by the relatively late dating of the first occurrences of glazed ceramic ware found in Pliska. At the very earliest these came from the late ninth century, though some certainly dated from the tenth and eleventh centuries as well. However, more recent investigation of the Asar-dere area has shown that the area contained a large waste disposal site alongside multiple hearths and kilns all dating from the earliest occupation phase. The content of the waste shows that ceramics were produced early in the settlement's history. Other finds from this first phase of occupation (from the eighth until the beginning of the ninth century) include those connected with iron processing, such as slag, charcoal, ash, and pig iron. Fragments and solid droplets of glass suggest glassmaking are also found from this same period. These types of finds are not extant in this area in the tenth and eleventh centuries, when it was instead occupied by numerous small and primitive grubenhaus dwellings. According to Henning; ‚ÄúIt was not the case that a predominantly agricultural style of living opened the way to a stepwise growth in craft activities, but rather a situation of fully developed and highly specialized artisan production was followed later by a process of broad ruralization‚Äù. Scholarly disputes Some scholars, such as Georgiev and Kirilov, have proposed that Pliska was not in fact the capital of Bulgaria during this period at all. Georgiev suggests that Pliska was only a seasonal residence with small timber buildings at least until the middle of the eighth century. Kirilov offers the explanation that like the Ottonian kings, the Bulgar rulers were itinerant, and travelled between multiple different residences. Additionally, prior to some more recent finds in the Asar-dere area of the archaeological site, it was believed that the craft activities attested by Milƒçev showed that site did not become a true large town until the later ninth or early tenth century, however Henning shows that this may have occurred in reverse order. Ceramic fragments on the floors of many of the pit- houses suggested (based on their depth in the soil) at first that the pottery was made and those houses were occupied in the later occupation period of the settlement. Excavation of the pit-house designated \\"grubenhaus No. 8\\" however precipitated a sharp conceptual turn amongst many researchers towards the belief that the pit-houses may largely have been built much earlier, and this suggests that the famous Great Basilica may have been built after rather than before the majority of the pit-houses, meaning it may not have been built in AD 864 as long supposed, but instead as late as the later tenth century. Modern Pliska right The ruins of the city of Pliska lie 3 km north of the modern village of Pliska. The site of the city is currently a National Archaeological Reserve. Ruins of the Great and the Small Palace, the strong stone fortifications and the Great Basilica (c. 875), used both as a royal church and as a national patriarchal cathedral, can be seen in the reserve. Under Ottoman rule, the village known as Pliska since 1947 was instead called Aboba (Aƒüa Baba in Ottoman times),\\"Bulgaristan'daki T√ºrk K√∂yleri\\" a name which it kept until 1925, when the name was changed to Pliskov, a variant of the current name. The settlement has a population of 1,124 and is located 146 m above sea level in Shumen Province at the south end of the Ludogorie plateau. It is approximately 400 km northeast of Sofia, at .

The airline was acquired in 2001 by Canada 3000, which in turn went bankrupt in the months following the events of September 11, 2001.  History  Royal Airlines Boeing 727-200 The airline was founded by Michel Leblanc in 1991. According to the June 1, 1999 North American edition of the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Royal was operating Airbus A310, Boeing 737-200 and Boeing 757-200 aircraft in scheduled passenger service to a number of destinations in Canada and the U.S. including Charlottetown, PEI, Edmonton, Fort Lauderdale, Halifax, Honolulu, Montreal (Dorval Airport), Orlando, St. Petersburg, FL, Toronto and Vancouver.http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1999 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Toronto & Vancouver flight schedules The airline also operated transatlantic scheduled passenger flights between Canada and Europe during its existence including service to Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich in Germany as well as destinations in the U.K..http://timetableimages.com, Royal Aviation system timetables Royal was acquired by Canada 3000 in 2001 in an all-stock deal. While the takeover/merger was touted in glowing terms in press releases, analysts quietly shared the opinion that, based on the terms of the transaction, Royal had few options and little time left. Michel Leblanc received Canada 3000 shares worth $84 million and became a Canada 3000 vice- chairman. Almost all of Royal Aviation's Royal Airlines aircraft were re- painted into the Canada 3000 livery, although some maintained a mixed livery, with the Canada 3000 logo and Royal Aviation tail design to recognize the merger between the two airlines. Canada 3000 also purchased Royal Cargo, renaming it Canada 3000 cargo. Canada 3000 cargo was later sold off and became Cargojet Airways. Only a few months after the merger closed, Leblanc was fired from Canada 3000 on June 2001 in a bitter feud, as Canada 3000 filed a lawsuit against him for allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. However, the allegations were never proven in court and Leblanc subsequently sold off all his shares of Canada 3000 before they stopped trading. In November 2001 the entire Canada 3000 company suddenly ceased operations with no warning for travellers or employees. The company filed for bankruptcy, citing a downturn in air travel during the weeks following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. All Canada 3000 workers as well as the former Royal Aviation workers lost their jobs. Leblanc went on to create discount airline Jetsgo in 2002 which went bankrupt in 2005, in a similar unexpected manner to Canada 3000's demise.

She was a Cabinet Minister in the 2005‚Äì08 Coalition Government led by former Prime Minister Helen Clark. She has been active in the field of human rights and good governance, particularly for women and the labour movement. In the 2005 election, she became the first openly gay female MP elected to the New Zealand Parliament. She was an MP for nine years between 2005 and 2014. Early years Street was born and raised in New Plymouth, and studied at Victoria University of Wellington, receiving a BA (Hons) in 1976. She joined the Labour Party in 1984, and was President of the Labour Party from April 1993 to November 1995. In 1990 she was appointed Director of Labour Studies at Auckland University, where she gained a Master of Philosophy in Industrial Relations in 1993. She served on the boards of government agencies Housing New Zealand and the Crown Forestry Rental Trust. In 1990 she was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal for service to New Zealand. In 1993, Street was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal for service to women. Member of Parliament In the 2005 election, Street was ranked thirty-sixth on its party list. This was the second highest position given by Labour in 2005 to a person who was not already a member of Parliament. She also contested the safe National seat of Taranaki-King Country against the incumbent National Party MP, Shane Ardern. Street was elected to parliament as a list MP. In her first speech to the New Zealand Parliament in 2005 Street set out a human rights agenda. She said she stood for public office to campaign for social justice and believed human rights were at the core of democracy. ‚ÄúI have not come into this House to be less than brave about the human rights of those whom some would seek to marginalise. I seek an inclusive, just, and tolerant society as one that is more likely to be peaceful, productive, and safe for our children to grow up in. A pluralist society is stable because of its differences, not despite them. It is the very differences between people, working together peacefully and with respect for each other, that allow a society to remain strong and cohesive.‚Äù During her nine years as an MP and Cabinet Minister she held a range of roles. Her main responsibilities involved foreign affairs, human rights, workplace relations and higher education, and economic development. In the Helen Clark-led Government of 2005‚Äì2008 she was Minister of Housing, Minister for the Accident Compensation Corporation, Associate Minister of Tertiary Education, and Associate Minister of Economic Development. Street advanced legislation addressing tenants‚Äô insurance rights, ethical investment, banning the importation of goods made by slave labour, and the right to die with dignity. She has also been a lead supporter of legislated human rights for the LGBTQI communities. Street advocated on behalf of political prisoners and refugees from Myanmar. In 2010 she put a motion before the New Zealand Parliament to affirm the commitment to human rights for political prisoners in Myanmar. She also worked with a local Myanmar refugee group while she was a Member of Parliament based in the city of Nelson. During 2011 she raised the profile of the refugee community by organising cultural events and working with authorities to obtain special immigration visas. She visited Myanmar in November 2012 to observe the rollout of the Gavi vaccination programme to immunise in excess of one million children. Street supported the professional development of young leaders from Myanmar who made an official visit to New Zealand in June 2015. Even though she had left Parliament by this time, an overseas aid project funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked her to contribute to its Myanmar Young Leaders Programme.  Retirement from Parliament  Following the election of the 51st New Zealand Parliament Street failed to be returned on the list despite her high placing. Maryan Street had the opportunity to return to Parliament when Jacinda Ardern won the seat vacated by David Shearer at the 2017 Mount Albert by-election, which allowed the next highest candidate from the Labour list to enter Parliament. Street declined the offer. After leaving Parliament Street continued to maintain a high profile as a campaigner for other human rights causes, such as the right to death with dignity. In a ‚ÄòNational Portrait‚Äô newspaper article published in major Fairfax dailies in 2016, Street discussed how she once planned to train as a Presbyterian minister and how that upbringing had influenced her to take a ‚Äúcompassionate‚Äù approach to policies. Street works full-time for KiwiRail as the Employee Relations Manager under Andrew Norton, Group General Manager Human Resources. Street has been an employee of KiwiRail since 20 April 2015. International work Street worked as an international observer of general elections across Africa and Asia, mostly on behalf of the Commonwealth, with a focus on human rights and good governance. In 2007 she travelled to Lesotho to join the Commonwealth Expert Team observing the parliamentary elections. In 2009 the United Nations Development Programme asked her to participate in a seminar in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on the issue of power sharing in multi-party democracies. She represented New Zealand at a joint European Parliament-United Nations conference of international parliamentarians in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2012. The conference addressed the implementation of the programme of action of the International Conference on Population and Development. She returned to Lesotho in 2015 as a member of the Commonwealth Observer Group for the Lesotho National Assembly elections. In 2018 she was a member of the Commonwealth Observer Group which assessed the general elections in Sierra Leone. She was a member of the Commonwealth Observer Group which monitored the 2019 Parliamentary elections in Maldives. She is an alumna of the New Zealand Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians group, part of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA), which works to increase gender diversity in CPA activities and programmes.

This film was Greenaway's first collaboration with cinematographer Sacha Vierny, who went on to shoot virtually all of Greenaway's work in the 1980s and 1990s, until Vierny's death. Greenaway referred to Vierny as his \\"most important collaborator\\". The film is a rumination on life, love, bad sex, doubling, man's mistreatment of animals, artifice v. the life force and the inevitability of birth, death and decay. Plot Twin zoologists Oswald and Oliver Deuce (Brian Deacon and Eric Deacon) are at work studying the behaviour of animals at a zoo, when their wives are killed in a car accident involving a large swan which crashes through the car windscreen. The woman who was driving the car, Alba Bewick (Andr√©a Ferr√©ol), is not killed, but has a leg amputated. Venus de Milo (Frances Barber), a woman associated with the zoo, attempts to forge a relationship with the twins, ostensibly to help them recover from their loss. Meanwhile, Oswald and Oliver gradually become obsessed with images of growth and decay, watching videos on the origins of life and creating time- lapse video of decomposing life forms. They begin this latter task with a green apple, bitten into and rotting before their camera lens. The twins' descent sees them become romantically involved with Alba, and increasingly attached to one another. Venus de Milo remains involved with them enough to observe their obsessions grow: they take to video-taping the decomposition of prawns, and they take a personal interest in Alba's childhood, going so far as to ask her to show them a field seen in a photograph on her bedside table. They become obsessed with snails, and they take advantage of their contacts at the zoo to create decomposition videos of more and more complex animals, moving gradually up the food chain. Excerpts from Sir David Attenborough's TV series Life on Earth, including his narration, are featured in the film. Alba becomes a subject for the experiments of her surgeon, who eventually amputates her other leg, claiming it is putting stress on her spine. His true motive is to fashion Alba into a subject of his recreations of Johannes Vermeer paintings; Venus de Milo participates in this process, as well. Ultimately, the Deuce brothers' obsession with decay leads them to the top of the food chain, and to a complex life-and-death negotiation with Alba herself. The brothers' project seems the only possible emotional investment for either of them, so Alba offers herself as the final specimen to be photographed in its decay. However her family intervenes before the brothers can claim her, so they are forced to find another way to create their final time-lapse video. They do so by returning to the field of Alba's childhood and setting up the necessary equipment to facilitate and capture their own decomposition. A huge infestation of snails covers the equipment and bodies, however, and finally shorts out the electrical system, halting their grand project.

Philip French of The Observer wrote, \\"The energy is immense, the appearance of the film consistently sleek and visually exciting.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum considers it to be \\"the boldest and arguably the best of Peter Greenaway's fiction features\\". Not all reviews were positive, however.

The main island of Tsushima was once a single island but was divided into two in 1671 by the ≈åfunakoshiseto canal and into three in 1900 by the Manzekiseto canal. These canals were driven through isthmuses in the center of the island, creating \\"North Tsushima Island\\" (Kamino-shima) and \\"South Tsushima Island\\" (Shimono-shima). Tsushima also incorporates over 100 smaller islands, many tiny. The name Tsushima generally refers to all the islands collectively. Tsushima Island is in Nagasaki Prefecture. The island group measures about by and had a population of about 34,000 . The main islands (that is, the \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" islands, and the thin island that connects them) are the largest coherent satellite island group of Nagasaki Prefecture and the eighth largest in Japan. The city of Tsushima, Nagasaki lies on Tsushima and is divided into six boroughs.  Geography  Tsushima Island is located west of the Kanmon Strait at a latitude between Honshu and Kyushu of the Japanese mainland. The Korea Strait splits at the Tsushima Island Archipelago into two channels; the wider channel, closer to the mainland of Japan, is the Tsushima Strait. ≈åfunakoshi-Seto and Manzeki-Seto, the two canals built in 1671 and 1900 respectively, connect the deep indentation of As≈ç Bay (ÊµÖËåÖÊπæ) to the east side of the island. The archipelago comprises over 100 smaller islets in addition to the main island. Tsushima is the closest Japanese territory to the Korean Peninsula, lying approximately 50 km from Busan. On a clear day, the hills and mountains of the Korean peninsula are visible from the higher elevations on the two northern mountains. The nearest Japanese port, Iki, situated on Iki Island within the Tsushima Basin, is also 50 km away. Tsushima Island and Iki Island are collectively within the borders of the Iki‚ÄìTsushima Quasi-National Park, designated as a nature preserve and protected from further development. Much of Tsushima (89%) is covered by natural vegetation and mountains.Asahi.com article on Tsushima Tsushima Island has many mountains such as the Mt. Ohira, Mt. Yatate, Mt. Hokogatake, Mt. Koyasan, Mt. Ontake, Mt. Gogen. The Government of Japan administers Tsushima Island as a single entity despite the artificial waterways that have separated it into two islands. The northern area is known as Kamino-shima (‰∏äÂ≥∂), and the southern island as Shimono-shima (‰∏ãÂ≥∂). Both sub- islands have a pair of mountains.

The average temperature is ,Meteorologic data in Izuhara (Âé≥Âéü), Tsushima by Japan Meteorological Agency and the average yearly precipitation is 2,132.6 mm. The highest temperature ever recorded on the island is , on August 20, 2013, and the lowest , in 1895.Meteorologic data in Izuhara (Âé≥Âéü), Tsushima by Japan Meteorological Agency - most ~ 10th largest value on record Throughout most of the year, Tsushima is 1‚Äì2 ¬∞C cooler than the city of Nagasaki.Meteorologic data in Nagasaki (Èï∑Â¥é) by Japan Meteorological Agency The island's rainfall is generally higher than that of the main islands of Japan; this is attributed to the difference in their size. Because Tsushima is small and isolated, it is exposed on all sides to moist marine air, which releases precipitation as it ascends the island's steep slopes. Continental monsoon winds carry loess (yellow sand) from China in the spring and cool the island in the winter. The rainy season begins and ends later than in other areas in Nagasaki Prefecture, and Tsushima rarely suffers direct hits by typhoons. EcologyFauna= The island's fauna include leopard cat, Japanese marten, Siberian weasel, and rodents. Otters were discovered to be living in Tsushima in February 2017. Migrating birds that stop over on the island include hawks, harriers, eagles, and black-throated loons. Forests, covering 90% of the island, consist of broad-leafed evergreens, conifers, and deciduous trees including cypress. Honey bees are common, with many used to produce commercial honey.Nicol, C.W., \\"Hark ye to the Donkey's Ears\\", Japan Times, March 7, 2010, p. 12. The Tsushima Island pitviper (Gloydius tsushimaensis) is a venomous snake endemic (found nowhere else) to the Tsushima Island. Tsushima Reef, in the bay between Tsushima and Iki Island, is the northernmost coral reef in the world, surpassing the Iki Island reef discovered in 2001. It is dominated by cool- tolerant stony or Scleractinian Favia corals but the observed settling of tropical Acropora coral is expected to provide an ongoing indicator for continuing global warming.Hiroya Yamano et al., in the on-line journal Geology, 12 July 2012, reported by Joost DeVries at Reefbuilders and at Advanced Aquarist =Flora= The whole island is covered in forest and there are few plains. There are Yoshino cherry and Chionanthus retusus.

Of these economic activities, fishing amounts to 82.6% of the primary industry, with much of it dedicated to catching squid on the eastern coast of the island. The number of employees in the primary industries has been decreasing, while employee growth in the secondary and tertiary industries has been increasing. =Tourism= Tourism, targeting mainly South Koreans, has recently made a great contribution to the islands' economy. The number of Korean tourists to the island increased greatly after the launching of a high-speed ferry service from Busan to the island in 1999. In 2008, 72,349 Koreans visited the island. Due to a drop in the value of the won, the number fell to 45,266 in 2009. Korean tourists generate an estimated ¬•2.1 billion in revenue for the local economy and generate about 260 jobs on the island.Kaneko, Maya, (Kyodo News) \\"Tsushima's S. Koreans: guests or guerrillas?\\", Japan Times, March 5, 2010, p. 3. The island expected around 200,000 visitors from Korea in 2013, surpassing the number of visitors from within Japan for the first time. However, a summer pageant focused on a historical event involving Korean emissaries was cancelled that same year.  Tsushima city  Tsushima city, viewed from Shimizuyama. Tsushima city was established on March 1, 2004, from the merger of six towns on Tsushima Island: Izuhara, Mitsushima, and Toyotama (all from Shimoagata District), and Mine, Kamiagata, and Kamitsushima (all from Kamiagata District). It is the only city of Tsushima Subprefecture and encompasses the whole island.  Transportation  Tsushima Airport has flights to Fukuoka Airport (ANA flight) and Nagasaki Airport (ORC flight). There are ferries to Izuhara port, such as Iki via Hakata port in Fukuoka.  History Ancient and classical period= Kaneda Castle ruins Watazumi Shrine Hiroshige In Japanese mythology, Tsushima was one of the eight original islands created by the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Archaeological evidence suggests that Tsushima was already inhabited by settlers from the Japanese archipelago and Korean Peninsula from the J≈çmon period to the Kofun period. The Records of the Three Kingdoms, a Chinese historical text, describes a country called Du√¨ h«éi gu√≥ () with a population of more than one thousand households, which is commonly identified with Tsushima. It was one of the about 30 that composed the Yamatai union countries.zhulang.com These families exerted control over Iki Island, and established trading links with Yayoi Japan. Since Tsushima had almost no land to cultivate, islanders earned their living by fishing and trading. Since the beginning of the early sixth century, Tsushima has been an official province of Japan, known as Tsushima Province (today Tsushima, Nagasaki.) Under the Ritsury≈ç system, Tsushima became a province of Japan. This province was linked with Dazaifu, the political and economical center of Ky≈´sh≈´, as well as the central government of Japan. Due to its strategic location, Tsushima played a major role in defending Japan against invasions from the Asian continent and developing trade lines with Baekje and Silla of Three Kingdoms of Korea. After Baekje, which had been aided by Yamato Japan, was defeated in 663 by Sillan and Tang Chinese forces at the Battle of Baekgang, Japanese border guards were sent to Tsushima and Kaneda Castle was constructed on the island. Tsushima Province was controlled by officials called Tsushima no kuni no miyatsuko () until the Nara period, and then by the Abiru clan until the middle of the 13th century. The role and title of \\"Governor of Tsushima\\" was exclusively held by the Sh≈çni clan for generations. However, since the Sh≈çni actually resided in Ky≈´sh≈´, it was the S≈ç clan, known subjects of the Sh≈çni, who actually exerted control over these islands. The S≈ç clan governed Tsushima until the late 15th century. =Feudal period= Mongol invasion in 1274 Joseon missions to Japan started in the Muromachi era for about 400 years were welcomed by the Yamato people as seen in this painting of Edo Tsushima domain shipyard site ruins. Built in 1663 CE Tsushima was an important trade center during this period. After the Toi invasion, private trade started between Goryeo, Tsushima, Iki Island, and Ky≈´sh≈´, but halted during the Mongol invasions of Japan between 1274 and 1281. The Goryeosa, a history of the Goryeo dynasty, mentions that in 1274, Korean troops of the Mongol army led by Kim Bang-gyeong killed a great number of people on the islands. Tsushima became one of the major bases of the Wokou, Japanese pirates, also called wak≈ç, along with Iki and Matsuura. Due to repeated pirate raids, the Goryeo and Joseon at times placated the pirates by establishing trade agreements as well as negotiating with the Ashikaga shogunate and its deputy in Ky≈´sh≈´ and at other times used force to neutralize the pirates. In 1389, General Pak Wi (Êú¥Â®Å) of Goryeo attempted to clear the island of Wokou pirates, but uprisings in Korea forced him to return home. On June 19, 1419, the recently abdicated king Taejong of Joseon sent general Yi Jongmu to an expedition to Tsushima island to clear it of the Wokou pirates, using a fleet of 227 vessels and 17,000 soldiers, known in Japanese as the ≈åei Invasion. After suffering casualties in an ambush, the Korean Army negotiated a ceasefire and withdrew on July 3, 1419.\\"ÊúùÈÆÆÁéãÊúùÂÆüÈå≤‰∏ñÂÆó4Âç∑1Âπ¥7Êúà3Êó•\\" Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty King SejongVol.4 July 3 \\"ÊúùÈÆÆÁéãÊúùÂÆüÈå≤‰∏ñÂÆó4Âç∑1Âπ¥7Êúà9Êó•\\" Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty King SejongVol.4 July 9 \\"ÏÑ∏Ï¢Ö 4Í∂å, 1ÎÖÑ(1419 Í∏∞Ìï¥ / Î™Ö ÏòÅÎùΩ(Ê∞∏Ê®Ç) 17ÎÖÑ) 7Ïõî 9Ïùº(ÏûÑÏûê) 5Î≤àÏß∏Í∏∞ÏÇ¨Ïù¥ÏõêÏù¥ Îßâ ÎèåÏïÑÏò® ÏàòÍµ∞ÏùÑ ÎèåÎ†§ Îã§Ïãú ÎåÄÎßàÎèÑ ÏπòÎäî Í≤ÉÏù¥ ÎìùÏ±ÖÏù¥ ÏïÑÎãòÏùÑ Í≥†ÌïòÎã§\\" In 1443, the Daimy≈ç of Tsushima, S≈ç Sadamori proposed the Treaty of Gyehae.

The So Clan supported the uprising, but it was soon crushed. The uprising later came to be known as the \\"Disturbance of the Three Ports\\" (‰∏âÊµ¶„ÅÆ‰π± (Sanbo-No-Ran) in Japan and ÏÇºÌè¨ÏôúÎûÄ (‰∏âÊµ¶ÂÄ≠‰∫Ç, Sampo Waeran) in Korea). Trade resumed under the direction of King Jungjong in 1512, but only under strictly limited terms, and only twenty-five ships were allowed to visit Joseon annually.dictionary.goo.ne.jp In the late 16th century, Japanese leader Toyotomi Hideyoshi united the various feudal lords (daimy≈ç) under his command. Planning to unite all factions with a common cause, Hideyoshi's coalition attacked Joseon Korea, leading to the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598). Tsushima was the main naval base for this invasion, and in continuing support of the war, large numbers of Korean prisoners were transported to Tsushima until 1603. Portrait of S≈ç Yoshitoshi in 1615 In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi confirmed the S≈ç clan's possession of Tsushima. S≈ç Yoshitoshi (ÂÆó Áæ©Êô∫, 1568 ‚Äì 31 January 1615) was a S≈ç clan daimy≈ç (feudal lord) of the island domain of Tsushima. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu established a new shogunate; and S≈ç Yoshitoshi was officially granted Fuch≈´ Domain (100,000 koku) in Tsushima Province.Papinot, Jacques. (2003). Nobiliare du Japon -- S≈ç, p. 56; Papinot, Jacques Edmond Joseph. (1906). Dictionnaire d'histoire et de g√©ographie du Japon. After Japan's attempts at conquest failed, peace was re-established between the two nations. Once again, the islands became a port for merchants. Both the Joseon Dynasty and the Tsushima-Fuch≈´ Domain sent their trading representatives to Tsushima, governing trade until 1755. The island was described by Hayashi Shihei in Sangoku Ts≈´ran Zusetsu, which was published in 1785. It was identified as part of Japan.Klaproth, Julius. (1832). San kokf tsou ran to sets, ou Aper√ßu g√©n√©ral des trois royaumes, p. 96; excerpt, \\"... et vis-√†-vis de l'√Æle de Toui ma tao (Tsou sima) qui fait partie du Japon ....\\" The Tsushima-Fuch≈´ Domain shipyard was built in 1663 CE. There are still ruins of the shipyard on the island. In 1811, for cost reduction, representatives of the Tokugawa shogunate met at Tsushima with ambassadors from the Joseon king (Joseon Tongsinsa). Until the Meiji, Tsushima was a frontier between Japan and Korea, heavily dependent on the trade with Korea, with unique institutions/systems of trade which strongly resembled those of Korean, not Japanese, institutions - for instance, measurement system for the taxation of land in Japan, is determined by the production of kokus of rice. Tsushima had a low production of rice, so it was permitted to use a unique survey system (Kendaka (ÈñìÈ´ò)) by Tokugawa shogunate. Because it had originated in China Land Survey System (ÈñìÂ∞∫Ê≥ï), it was similar to the system of Korea - gyeolbu (ÁµêË≤†Âà∂); Tsushima law resembled Korean law in its calculation of finances. \\"Unfree labor\\" or slavery for fixed periods of time, always rare in any form in the rest of Japan, existed as an established institution, often as a form of punishment, in Tsushima as it did in Korea. The Tsushima han owned a place of residence in Busan, according to Murai Shosuke, the Japanese was given the title from the Joseon dynasty is called \\"marginal men\\", was responsible for security in this residential area. Lewis also cites the official preparations of S≈ç Yoshitoshi listing some 1,000 Koreans as guides in preparation for Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea to support a \\"zone of ambiguous boundary qualities\\" aspect of Tsushima. The islanders spoke the Tsushima dialect and their daily customs, social structure, and economic interactions were in Japanese, with exception of loanwords from Korean in their dialect. =Modern period= Canal constructed by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1900 In an episode now known as the Tsushima incident, the Imperial Russian Navy tried to establish a base on the island in 1861, but eventually foreign intervention caused them to abandon the idea. As a result of the abolition of the han system, the Tsushima Fuchu domain became part of Izuhara Prefecture in 1871. In the same year, Izuhara Prefecture was merged with Imari Prefecture, which was renamed Saga Prefecture in 1872. Tsushima was transferred to Nagasaki Prefecture in 1872, and its districts of Kamiagata (‰∏äÁúå) and Shimoagata (‰∏ãÁúå) were merged to form the modern city of Tsushima. This change was part of widespread reforms within Japan which started after 1854. Japan was at this time becoming a modern nation state and regional power, with widespread changes in government, industry, and education. After the First Sino-Japanese War ended with the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Japan felt humiliated when the Triple Intervention of the three great powers of Germany, France, and Russia forced it to return the valuable Liaodong Peninsula to China under threat of force. Consequently, the Japanese leadership correctly anticipated that a war with Russia or another Western imperial power was likely. Between 1895 and 1904, the Imperial Japanese Navy blasted the Manzeki-Seto canal wide and deep; it was later expanded to wide and deep through a mountainous rocky isthmus of the island between As≈ç Bay to the west and Tsushima Strait to the east, technically dividing the island into three islands. Strategic concerns explain the scope and funding of the canal project by Japan during an era when it was still struggling to establish an industrial economy. The canal enabled the Japanese to move transports and warships quickly between their main naval bases in the Seto Inland Sea (directly to the east) via the Kanmon and Tsushima Strait into the Korea Strait or to destinations beyond in the Yellow Sea. An imperial ordinance in July 1899 established Izuhara, Sasuna, and Shishimi as open ports for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.US Department of State. (1906). digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759. During the Russo- Japanese War in 1905, the Russian Baltic Fleet under Admiral Rozhestvensky, after making an almost year-long trip to East Asia from the Baltic Sea, was crushed by the Japanese under Admiral Togo Heihachiro at the Battle of Tsushima. The Japanese third squadron (cruisers) began shadowing the Russian fleet off the tip of the south island and followed it through the Tsushima Strait where the main Japanese fleet awaited. The battle began at slightly east-northeast of the northern island around midday, and ended to its north a day later when the Japanese surrounded the Russian Fleet. Japan won a decisive victory. From 1948 to 1949, due to the Jeju Uprising, and its resulting suppression and massacre by anti-communist Korean forces, many Jeju residents fled and took refuge in Tsushima.JoongAng Ilbo 14:33 October 1, 2002 In 1950, the South Korean government asserted sovereignty over the island based on \\"historical claims\\".\\"U.S. State Department, Report from the Office of Intelligence Research: Korea¬¥s Recent Claim to the Island of Tsushima (prepared on March 30, 1950)\\"; retrieved 2013-4-2.

Foreign Commerce and Navigation of the United States, p. lv. While the South Korean government has since relinquished claims on the island, some Koreans (including some members of the Korean parliament) have periodically attempted to dispute the ownership of the island. In 1973, one of the transmitters for the OMEGA-navigation system was built on Tsushima. It was dismantled in 1998. Today, Tsushima is part of Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. On March 1, 2004, the six towns on the island ‚Äì Izuhara, Mitsushima, Toyotama, Mine, Kamiagata, and Kamitsushima ‚Äì were merged to create the city of Tsushima. About 700 Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel are stationed on the island to watch the local coastal and ocean areas.  Historical dispute  Tsushima is administered by Nagasaki Prefecture. The South Korean city of Changwon also asserts ownership of the island, calling it Daemado (; ), the Korean reading of the characters used in the Japanese name (). Archaeological evidence suggests that Tsushima was already inhabited by settlers from the Japanese archipelago from the J≈çmon period (14,000 BCE) to the Kofun period (300 CE). Also, according to the Sanguo Zhi in the 3rd century Tsushima was Tsuikai-koku and one of the 30 that composed the Yamataikoku union countries (ÈÇ™È¶¨Âè∞ÂõΩ). This island, as Tsushima Province, has been ruled by Japanese governments since the Nara period (710 CE). According to the Korean history book Samguk Sagi written in 1145, Tsushima is ruled by the Japanese from CE 400.‰∏âÂõΩÂè≤Ë®ò(Samguk Sagi) Â∑ª‰∏â Êñ∞ÁæÖÊú¨Ë®ò ‰∏â ÂØ¶ËÅñÂ∞ºÂ∏´‰ªäÊù° \\"‰∏ÉÂπ¥„ÄÅÊò•‰∫åÊúà„ÄÅÁéãËÅûÂÄ≠‰∫∫ÊñºÂØæÈ¶¨Â≥∂ÁΩÆÂñ∂Ë≤Ø‰ª•ÂÖµÈù©Ë≥áÁ≥ß„ÄÅ‰ª•Ë¨ÄË•≤Êàë ÊàëÊ¨≤ÂÖàÂÖ∂Êú´Áô∫ Á∑¥Á≤æÂÖµ ÊíÉÁ†¥ÂÖµÂÑ≤\\" On June 19, 1419, Japan repelled the ≈åei Invasion of king Sejong of Joseon. He sent general Yi Jong-mu to an expedition to Tsushima island to clear it of the Wokou pirates, using a fleet of 227 vessels and 17,000 soldiers. The Joseon invaders suffered casualties in an ambush and the Korean Army negotiated a ceasefire and withdrew on July 3, 1419. Afterwards, in diplomatic exchanges, the lords of Tsushima would be granted exclusive trading privileges with Joseon in exchange for maintaining control and order of pirate threats originating from the island which was the very reason for the original expedition. The Tsushima Fuchu domain became part of Izuhara Prefecture in 1871. In the same year, Izuhara Prefecture merged with Imari Prefecture, which was renamed Saga Prefecture on May 29, 1872. The island provinces of Tsushima and Iki were merged with the western half of the former province of Hizen and became modern-day Tsushima, Nagasaki Prefecture in 1872. The South Korean government made a claim in 1948, but it was rejected by Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) in 1949. On July 19, 1951, the South Korean government agreed that the earlier demand for Tsushima had been dropped by the South Korean government with regard to the Japanese peace treaty negotiations.The Foreign Relations Series (FRUS) 1951 VolumeVI P1203. Subject:Japanese Peace Treaty , Participants:Dr. Yu Chan Yang, Korean Ambassador and John Foster Dulles U.S. Ambassador The status of Tsushima as an island of Japan was re-confirmed in 1965. In 2008, Yasunari Takarabe, incumbent Mayor of Tsushima rejected the South Korean territorial claim: \\"Tsushima has always been Japan. I want them to retract their wrong historical perception.

It was recorded in June and September 1968, and released on Columbia Records. It was released in the United Kingdom by the company's subsidiary Columbia (CBS) in 1968Entry at Discogs and in the United States during February 1969. The album is a transitional work for Davis, who was shifting stylistically from acoustic recordings with his second \\"great\\" quintet to his \\"electric\\" period. Filles de Kilimanjaro was well received by contemporary music critics, who viewed it as a significant release in modern jazz.  Background  The June sessions featured Wayne Shorter on saxophone, Herbie Hancock on the electric Rhodes piano, Ron Carter on electric bass, and Tony Williams on drums. The September sessions replaced Hancock with Chick Corea, and Carter with Dave Holland, making Filles de Kilimanjaro the last Miles album to feature his Second Great Quintet, although all except Carter would play on his next album, In A Silent Way. During the September sessions, Holland played acoustic bass and Corea played an RMI Electra-piano in addition to acoustic piano. These are Holland and Corea's first known recordings with Davis. The album was produced by Teo Macero and engineered by Frank Laico and Arthur Kendy. The album title refers, in part, to Kilimanjaro African Coffee, a company in which Davis had made a financial investment. Davis decided to list all the song titles in French to give the album an exotic touch. Davis married Betty O. Mabry Davis in September 1968, and named \\" (Miss Mabry)\\" for her. The song itself was recorded during the same month as Davis's wedding and Betty appears on the album cover.  Composition and performance  { style=\\"font-size:100%\\" align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" color=\\"black\\" width=130px  } The album can be seen as a transitional work between Davis's mainly acoustic recordings with the Second Quintet and his later electric period (for example, Bitches Brew). It is suffused in the heady abstraction of the 1960s, but attentive to blues tonalities, electronic textures, and dancing rhythms of later jazz fusion. Davis apparently saw it as a transitional work for him, as the album was the first in what would become a series of his releases to bear the subtitle \\"Directions in music by Miles Davis\\". However, author Paul Tingen points out that while Carter and Hancock played electric instruments at the first recording session, the later session was a bit of a throwback, in which Holland played only acoustic bass and Corea played both acoustic and electric piano. Stanley Crouch, a staunch critic of Davis's use of electric instruments, has described the album as \\"the trumpeter's last important jazz record\\". Noted linguist and Miles Davis-biographer Jack Chambers later wrote that the band sought to expand beyond their usual minimal structure and find a common mood, wanting listeners to \\"discover the unity of the pieces instead of just locating it, as viewers must discover the unity in a painting with several simultaneous perspectives\\". The melodic complexity of \\"Petits Machins (Little Stuff)\\" highlights Davis's interest in departing from post-bop structure towards the sounds and textures of his subsequent fusion work. Music writer Marcus Singletary commented on its complexity, \\"True to the general concept of Filles de Kilimanjaro, a mosaic of controlled chaos becomes the defining sound of 'Little Stuff'\\".Singletary, Marcus (November 9, 2008). Miles Davis: Petits Machins (Little Stuff) ‚Äì Jazz.com  Jazz Music ‚Äì Jazz Artists ‚Äì Jazz News . Jazz.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-03. On the recording, the quintet expresses an meter with a repeating riff and chromatically ascending dominant harmonies in the recording first section. Section two moves to a contrasting 10-bar section in meter, with the opening six bars relying on an F pedal point in the bass, above which occur shifting harmonies each measure. The static F pedal section yields to a syncopated progression with meters seven to eight and a change of bass in meters nine to 10, as the quintet makes an alteration to section two during the improvisations. Music theorist Keith Waters cites this as an example of \\"Davis's‚Äîby now‚Äîwell-worn practice of metric deletion\\", in which throughout the trumpet solo, the quintet maintains a repeated nine- bar cycle, rather than the 10 bars of section two heard during the first section. The quintet omits bar 10 of section two during the solos and maintains the harmonic progression of bars 1 through 9. As in the first section, the syncopated progression occurs in bar 7, but Carter does not participate in playing the syncopation of meters seven to eight during the improvisations, while Hancock interprets this progression more freely. Singletary said of its musical significance: As with the album's title track, the quintet does not return to the first section and the recording concludes with a second Davis improvisation. Gil Evans, with whom Davis had previously collaborated, helped compose, arrange, and produce the album, though he is not mentioned in the credits. Evans co-composed \\"\\", which he later recorded as \\"Eleven\\" with himself and Davis listed as co-composers. The song \\" (Miss Mabry)\\", while credited to Davis, is actually Gil Evans' reworking of \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" by Jimi Hendrix (Davis and Evans had met with Hendrix several times to exchange ideas). At the same time, some portions of the song resemble Mann, Weil, Leiber and Stoller's \\"On Broadway\\".  Critical reception  In a contemporary review, Rolling Stone claimed that \\"no amount of track-by-track description here can begin to convey the beauty and intensity. There are five songs, but really they fit together as five expressions of the same basic piece, one sustained work\\". In a retrospective review of the album, Uncut called it \\"a masterpiece of tropical exoticism\\". Sputnikmusic staff writer Tyler Fisher commented that the rhythm section-players \\"sound entirely innovative and fresh\\" and \\"The whole band, in both quintets, has an extreme awareness about each other and knows exactly where each soloist is going\\". He attributed its \\"more avant-garde feel\\" to a \\"lack of form and the constant outlook of many measures ahead\\", while calling it \\"a full out enjoyable listen, showcasing enough variety and virtuosity to not make the 70-minute album a tiring listen\\". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called its music \\"unpretentiously adventurous, grounded in driving, mildly funky rhythms and bluesy growls from Miles, graced with weird, colorful flourishes from the band [...] Where Miles in the Sky meandered a bit, this is considerably more focused\\", dubbing it as \\"the swan song for his second classic quintet, arguably the finest collective of musicians he ever worked with\\". Erlewine also cited the album as \\"the beginning of a new phase for Miles, the place that he begins to dive headfirst into jazz-rock fusion\\", and commented on its significance in Davis's catalogue: Down Beat critic John Ephland called Filles de Kilimanjaro \\"the stylistic precursor to the ever-popular In a Silent Way of 1969\\", writing that \\"Filles is performed (and edited) like a suite, with a sense of flow unlike anything Davis had recorded up to that point. That flow is enhanced by a music played all in one key (F), with only five 'tunes,' and with a mood and rhythms that change gradually from start to finish\\". Ephland concluded in his review, \\"In passing, Filles de Kilimanjaro is a turning-point album unlike any other for Davis: For the first time, his bebop roots were essentially severed, rockier rhythms, electricity and ostinato-driven bass lines now holding sway\\".Ephland (2007), p. 315. Jim Santella from All About Jazz wrote that the album's music \\"flows with a lyricism that remains highly regarded in today‚Äôs format\\", concluding in his review that \\"Filles De Kilimanjaro remains one of the classic albums from their collaboration, and represents a high point in modern jazz\\".Santella, Jim (August 1, 2002).

Antoine Barthelemy Clot (7 November 179328 August 1868) was a French doctor known as Clot Bey while practicing in Egypt. Early life and education He was born at Grenoble. In 1823, he graduated in medicine and surgery at Montpellier. His thesis for Doctor of Surgery was entitled Dangers of the Instrumental Manipulation in Obstetrical Delivery. Efforts in Egypt Clot in Egyptian army uniform teaching the first modern Anatomy lesson at Abu-Zaabal on 20 June 1829. The lesson was attended by some Sheikhs from al-Azhar. During the French occupation of Egypt, Napoleon designated Kasr al-Aini a hospital for his troops in 1799, and then afterwards proposed the opening of a school to teach local Egyptian students the medicine required to treat the troops. This is how, after practicing for a time at Marseilles, Clot was invited by Muhammad Ali, Viceroy of Egypt to direct the Kasr al-Aini (Qasral-‚ÄòAyni) School of Medicine at the Army hospital of Abou Zabel which later transferred to Cairo. The Viceroy of Egypt was determined to keep his army in good health and had sent emissaries to recruit doctors in Europe. On 24 January 1825, Clot sailed for Cairo on the Bonne Emilie with 20 other European doctors destined to assist him. Clot arrived in Egypt with the title of Surgeon-in-Chief of the Armies. As there was no medical care system in Egypt at that time, he began by instituting French Army regulations for the Egyptian army camps. The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials set against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons, but this was the foundation for modern medicine in Egypt. Clot was made chief surgeon to Muhammad Ali Pasha, viceroy of Egypt, at Abu Zabal, near Cairo. He shaped the Kasr El Aini Hospital and schools for all branches of medical instruction, as well as facilities for the study of the French language; and, notwithstanding the most serious religious difficulties, instituted the study of anatomy by means of dissection. In 1832, Muhammad Ali allowed Clot to establish a School of Medicine for women; In the same year, Muhammad Ali gave him the distinction of bey without requiring him to abjure his religion. In 1836 he received the rank of general, and was appointed head of medical administration for the entire country. Return to France Tomb of Clot-bey at Marseilles, France. In 1849 he returned to Marseilles, though he revisited Egypt in 1856. He died in Marseilles in 1868, aged 74.

Properties  From the few idiomatic words that survive, only a little can be said about special features of the language. A notable sound-law is that the Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirates (/b ∞, d ∞, g ∞/) sometimes appear as voiced stops /b, d, g/, (written ), whereas they are generally unvoiced as /p ∞, t ∞, k ∞/ () elsewhere in Greek.Exceptions to the rule: *' arhphys Macedonian (Attic ·ºÅœÅœÄŒµŒ¥œéŒΩ harped√¥n cord, yarn) *' bagaron (Attic œáŒªŒπŒ±œÅœåŒΩ chliaron 'warm') (cf.

Macedonians use 'b' instead of 'ph', while Delphians use 'b' in the place of 'p'. *Macedonian ' m√°geiros ('butcher') was a loan from Doric into Attic. Vittore Pisani has suggested an ultimately Macedonian origin for the word, which could then be cognate to ' m√°khaira ('knife', < PIE *magh-, 'to fight')ƒåesko-jihoslovensk√° revue, Volume 4, 1934, p. 187. If ' got√°n ('pig') is related to *gwou ('cattle'), this would indicate that the labiovelars were either intact, or merged with the velars, unlike the usual Greek treatment (Attic ' bo√ªs). Such deviations, however, are not unknown in Greek dialects; compare Laconian Doric (the dialect of Sparta) ' glep- for common Greek ' blep-, as well as Doric ' gl√°ch≈çn and Ionic ' glƒìch≈çn for common Greek ' blƒìch≈çn.Albrecht von Blumenthal, Hesychstudien, Stuttgart, 1930, 21. A number of examples suggest that voiced velar stops were devoiced, especially word-initially: ' k√°nadoi, 'jaws' (< PIE *genu-); ' k√≥mbous, 'molars' (< PIE *gombh-); within words: ' ark√≥n (Attic ' arg√≥s); the Macedonian toponym Akesamenai, from the Pierian name Akesamenos (if Akesa- is cognate to Greek agassomai, agamai, \\"to astonish\\"; cf. the Thracian name Agassamenos). In Aristophanes' The Birds, the form ' keblƒìpyris ('red head', the name of a bird, perhaps the goldfinch or redpoll) is found,Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, An Intermediate Greek-English Lexicon, Œ∫ŒµŒ≤ŒªŒÆœÄœÖœÅŒπœÇ.

A number of the Macedonian words, particularly in Hesychius of Alexandria' lexicon, are disputed (i.e., some do not consider them actual Macedonian words) and some may have been corrupted in the transmission. Thus abroutes, may be read as abrouwes (), with tau () replacing a digamma.Olivier Masson, \\"Sur la notation occasionnelle du digamma grec par d'autres consonnes et la glose mac√©donienne abroutes\\", Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de linguistique de Paris, 90 (1995) 231‚Äì239. Also proposed by O. Hoffmann and J. Kalleris. If so, this word would perhaps be encompassable within a Greek dialect; however, others (e.g. A. Meillet) see the dental as authentic and think that this specific word would perhaps belong to an Indo-European language different from Greek. A. Panayotou summarizes some features generally identified through ancient texts and epigraphy:A history of ancient Greek: from the beginnings to late antiquity, Maria Chritƒì, Maria Arapopoulou, Cambridge University Press (2007), p. 439‚Äì441 =Phonology= *Occasional development of voiced aspirates (*bh, *dh, *gh) into voiced stops (b, d, g) (e.g. ŒíŒµœÅŒµŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ±, Attic Œ¶ŒµœÅŒµŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑) *Retention of */a:/ (e.g. ŒúŒ±œáŒ¨œÑŒ±œÇ), also present in EpiroticPackard Institute epigraphic database http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions//main *[a:] as result of contraction [a:] + […î:] *Apocope of short vowels in prepositions in synthesis (œÄŒ±œÅŒ∫Œ±œÑœÑŒØŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ, Attic œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÑŒØŒ∏ŒµŒºŒ±Œπ) *Syncope (hyphairesis) and diphthongization are used to avoid hiatus (e.g. ŒòŒµœÑŒØŒºŒ±, Attic ŒòŒµŒøœÑŒØŒºŒ∑; compare with Epirotic ŒõŒ±Œ≥Œ≠œÑŒ±, Doric ŒõŒ±ŒøŒ≥·ºêœÑŒ±). *Occasional retention of the pronunciation [u] Œøf /u(:)/ in local cult epithets or nicknames (ŒöŒøœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ¥Œ±œÇ = ŒöœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒØŒ¥Œ±œÇ) *Raising of /…î:/ to /u:/ in proximity to nasal (e.g. ŒöŒ¨ŒΩŒøœÖŒΩ, Attic ŒöŒ±ŒΩœéŒΩ) *Simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /i:n/ (Œ≥ŒØŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ, Attic Œ≥ŒØŒ≥ŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ) *Loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /sth/ (> /st/) (Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉœÑŒ±Œπ, Attic Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ) = Morphology = Ancient Macedonian morphology is shared with ancient Epirus, including some of the oldest inscriptions from Dodona.Eric Lhote (2006) Les lamelles Oraculaires de Dodone. Droz, Geneve. The morphology of the first declension nouns with an -Œ±œÇ ending is also shared with Thessalian (e.g. Epitaph for Pyrrhiadas, KierionRoberts, E.S., An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy vol. 1 no. 237). *First-declension masculine and feminine in -Œ±œÇ and -Œ± respectively (e.g. Œ†ŒµœçŒ∫ŒµœÉœÑŒ±œÇ, ŒõŒ±ŒøŒºŒ¨Œ≥Œ±) *First- declension masculine genitive singular in -Œ± (e.g. ŒúŒ±œáŒ¨œÑŒ±) *First-declension genitive plural in -·æ∂ŒΩ *First person personal pronoun dative singular ·ºêŒºŒØŒΩ *Temporal conjunction ·ΩÅœÄœåŒ∫Œ± *Possibly, a non-sigmatic nominative masculine singular in the first declension (·º±œÄœÄœåœÑŒ±, Attic ·º±œÄœÄœåœÑŒ∑œÇ)  Onomastics  Anthroponymy = M. Hatzopoulos summarizes the Macedonian anthroponymy (that is names borne by people from Macedonia before the expansion beyond the Axios or people undoubtedly hailing from this area after the expansion) as follows:Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence, Elaine Matthews, Simon Hornblower, Peter Marshall Fraser, British Academy, Oxford University Press (2000), p. 103 *Epichoric (local) Greek names that either differ from the phonology of the introduced Attic or that remained almost confined to Macedonians throughout antiquity *Panhellenic (common) Greek names *Identifiable non-Greek (Thracian and Illyrian) names *Names without a clear Greek etymology that can't however be ascribed to any identifiable non-Greek linguistic group. Common in the creation of ethnics is the use of -Œ≠œÉœÑŒ∑œÇ, -ŒµœÉœÑœåœÇ especially when derived from sigmatic nouns (·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ > ·ΩàœÅŒ≠œÉœÑŒ∑œÇ but also Œî·øñŒøŒΩ > ŒîŒπŒ±œÉœÑŒ±ŒØ). = Toponymy = The toponyms of Macedonia proper are generally Greek, though some of them show a particular phonology and a few others are non-Greek.  Calendar  The Macedonian names of about half or more of the months of the ancient Macedonian calendar have a clear and generally accepted Greek etymology (e.g. Dios, Apellaios, Artemisios, Loos, Daisios), though some of the remaining ones have sometimes been considered to be Greek but showing a particular Macedonian phonology (e.g. Audunaios has been connected to \\"Haides\\" *A-wid and Gorpiaios/Garpiaios to \\"karpos\\" fruit).  Epigraphy  Macedonian onomastics: the earliest epigraphical documents attesting substantial numbers of Macedonian proper names are the second Athenian alliance decree with Perdiccas II (~417‚Äì413 BC), the decree of Kalindoia (~335‚Äì300 BC) and seven curse tablets of the 4th century BC bearing mostly names.Athens, bottom-IG I¬≥ 89 ‚Äì Kalindoia-Meletemata 11 K31 ‚Äì Pydna-SEG 52:617,I (6) till SEG 52:617,VI ‚Äì Mygdonia-SEG 49:750Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence by Simon Hornblower, Elaine Matthews Oktadrachm of Alexander I 498 ‚Äì 454 BCE.jpgOctadrachm of Alexander I of Macedon, early 5th century B.C.

The Pella curse tablet, a text written in a distinct Doric Greek dialect, found in 1986 and dated to between mid to early 4th century BC, has been forwarded as an argument that the ancient Macedonian language was a dialect of North-Western Greek, part of the Doric dialect group.\\"...but we may tentatively conclude that Macedonian is a dialect related to North-West Greek.\\", Olivier Masson, French linguist, ‚ÄúOxford Classical Dictionary: Macedonian Language‚Äù, 1996.  Hesychius Glossary  A body of idiomatic words has been assembled from ancient sources, mainly from coin inscriptions, and from the 5th century lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria, amounting to about 150 words and 200 proper names, though the number of considered words sometimes differs from scholar to scholar. The majority of these words can be confidently assigned to Greek albeit some words would appear to reflect a dialectal form of Greek. There are, however, a number of words that are not easily identifiable as Greek and reveal, for example, voiced stops where Greek shows voiceless aspirates.J. P. Mallory & D.Q Adams ‚Äì Encyclopedia of Indo- European culture, Chicago-London: Fitzroy Dearborn. pp. 361. Specific words and consonant shifts are, however, present in most dialects of most languages. marked words which have been corrupted. *' abagna 'roses amaranta (unwithered)' (Attic rhoda, Aeolic broda roses).

Macedonian in Classical sources  Among the references that have been discussed as possibly bearing some witness to the linguistic situation in Macedonia, there is a sentence from a fragmentary dialogue, apparently between an Athenian and a Macedonian, in an extant fragment of the 5th century BC comedy 'Macedonians' by the Athenian poet Strattis (fr. 28), where a stranger is portrayed as speaking in a rural Greek dialect. His language contains expressions such as for \\"you Athenians\\", being also attested in Homer, Sappho (Lesbian) and Theocritus (Doric), while appears only in \\"funny country bumpkin\\" contexts of Attic comedy.Steven Colvin, Dialect in Aristophanes and the politics of language in Ancient Greek, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 279. Another text that has been quoted as evidence is a passage from Livy (lived 59 BC-14 AD) in his Ab urbe condita (31.29). Describing political negotiations between Macedonians and Aetolians in the late 3rd century BC, Livy has a Macedonian ambassador argue that Aetolians, Acarnanians and Macedonians were \\"men of the same language\\".Livy, The History of Rome, 31.29.15, on Perseus This has been interpreted as referring to a shared North-West Greek speech (as opposed to Attic Koin√©).A. Panayotou: The position of the Macedonian dialect. In: Maria Arapopoulou, Maria Chritƒì, Anastasios-Phoivos Christides (eds.), A History of Ancient Greek: From the Beginnings to Late Antiquity, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 433‚Äì458 (Google Books). In another passage, Livy states that an announcement was translated from Latin to Greek for Macedonians to understand.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.29, on Perseus Quintus Curtius Rufus, Philotas's trialE. Kapetanopoulos. \\"Alexander‚Äôs Patrius Sermo in the Philotas Affair\\", The Ancient World 30 (1999), pp. 117‚Äì128. (PDF or HTM) and the statement that the Greek-speaking Branchidae had common language with the Macedonians.Quintus Curtius Rufus, Historiae Alexandri Magni, VII.5.33, (Loeb edition, Latin), (John C. Rolfe, English translation) Over time, \\"Macedonian\\" (ŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ), when referring to language (and related expressions such as ŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ; to speak in the Macedonian fashion) acquired the meaning of Koine Greek.C. Brixhe, A. Panayotou, 1994, ¬´Le Mac√©donien¬ª in Langues indo- europ√©ennes, p. 208  Contributions to the Koine  As a consequence of the Macedonians' role in the formation of the Koine, Macedonian contributed considerable elements, unsurprisingly including some military terminology (Œ¥ŒπŒºŒøŒπœÅŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, œÑŒ±ŒæŒØŒ±œÅœáŒøœÇ, ·ΩëœÄŒ±œÉœÄŒπœÉœÑŒ±ŒØ, etc.). Among the many contributions were the general use of the first declension grammar for male and female nouns with an -as ending, attested in the genitive of Macedonian coinage from the early 4th century BC of Amyntas III (ŒëŒúŒ•ŒùŒ§Œë in the genitive; the Attic form that fell into disuse would be ŒëŒúŒ•ŒùŒ§ŒüŒ•). There were changes in verb conjugation such as in the Imperative Œ¥Œ≠ŒæŒ± attested in Macedonian sling stones found in Asiatic battlefields, that became adopted in place of the Attic forms. Koine Greek established a spirantisation of beta, gamma and delta, which has been attributed to the Macedonian influence.George Babiniotis (1992) The question of mediae in ancient Macedonian Greek reconsidered. In: Historical Philology: Greek, Latin, and Romance, Bela Brogyanyi, Reiner Lipp, 1992 John Benjamins Publishing) Other adoptions from the ancient Macedonian include the simplification of the sequence /ign/ to /i:n/ (Œ≥ŒØŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ, Attic Œ≥ŒØŒ≥ŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ) and the loss of aspiration of the consonant cluster /sth/ (> /st/) (Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉœÑŒ±Œπ, Attic Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ), for example as in a Koine inscription from Dura-Europos from the 2nd or 3rd century AD: \\"œÑŒøŒΩ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑ·ΩÄŒΩ ŒºŒΩ·º†œÉŒ∫ŒµœÉœÑŒµ\\".

Serving as the administrative center of Ochakiv Raion (district), the city itself does not belong to the raion and is designated as a city of regional significance. For many years the city-fortress served as a capital of the Ottoman province (eyalet). Geography The city is located right at the mouth of Dnieper, on the banks of the Dnieper-Bug Estuary. Between the Cape of Ochakiv (northern bank) and the Kinburn spit (southern bank) there are only . The Ochakiv and Kinburn fortresses controlled the entrance to Dnieper and Bug. HistoryEstablishment and names= Sigismund von Herberstein places 'Oczakow' (today's \\"Ochakiv\\") on the coast of Black Sea (Ponti Evxini) in his 1549 map. The strip of land, on which Ochakov is located today, was inhabited by Thracians and Scythians in ancient times. It was known as a part of Great (i. e. European) Scythia. In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Greek colonists had founded a commercial colony town, named Alektor, near the Thracian coast. Archaeological excavations also show that near the area was the old Milesian (ancient Greek) colony of Pontic Olbia; it is supposed that the same Greek expeditions settled Alektor. In the 1st century BC, Alektor became a Roman colony and part of the Roman empire. The area was part of the space in which the Romanians' ethnogenesis took place, and was also more generally a place of passage for many migratory people and tribes. As a result of the migrations, the city fell and the inhabitants lived in small settlements built on the shores of the Bug and Dnieper Rivers. During the Middle Ages the place was named Vozia by Romanians. The name is supposed to come from a plant known in Romanian as bozii or bozia (Sambucus ebulus), a medicinal herb frequently found there. The territory was a part of the Moldavian Brodnici rule. It fell under Tatar domination in the time of the Mongol invasion of Europe. Alexandru cel Bun (Alexander I, the Good), ruler of Moldavia (r. 1400‚Äì1432), and his ally Vitovt or Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (r. 1392‚Äì1430), freed the Vozia territory and a fortress was built again close to Alektor's ruins. Later the stronghold will be mentioned in Russian chronics as Dashev. In the 14th century the Senarega brothers, Genovese merchants and warriors, had settled a castle at the place called Lerici, very close to Vozia city. It was a good point for commerce with Romanians and Tatars, but the Senarega family's interference in Moldavia's internal affairs made the Moldavians from Cetatea AlbƒÉ (today's Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi) take the castle from them in 1455. In 1492, Crimean Tatars took Vozia from the Moldavians and named it √ñz√º-Cale, which literally meant \\"Dnieper-fortress\\". The name was also very similar to the then current Romanian Vozia. At that time, the city was also referred to as Kara-Kerman (\\"Black city\\") as an opposite to Cetatea AlbƒÉ (\\"White City\\", hence the synonymous naming as Ak-Kerman), also taken by the Tatars and Turkish army from their once Moldavian rulers. In 1493, the fortress was taken by the Moldavian's cossacks of Bohdan Gli≈Ñski. Due to its strategic location the fortress was a site of contest for a long time between Moldavia, Moldavia's ally Zaporizhian Sich, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and the Ottoman Empire. At a later date it became the centre of an Ottoman sanjak which included Khajidereh (today Ovidiopol), Khadjibey (Odessa), and Dubossary, as well as some 150 villages, and Silistra Province, sometimes called √ñzi Province, to which it belonged. Khadjibey later became a sanjak centre of its own. In 1600 Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave), Prince of Wallachia, took control of the city for a short time. Giovanni Battista Malbi noted in 1620 that the town and the land of Vozia, even if ruled by the Tatars, were inhabited by Romanians, describing them as having the Orthodox religion and a corrupt Latin-Italian language, with Slavic influences, as in those times the Old Slav language was the church language in all Romanian countries. The same ethnic note was made by Niccolo Barsi from Lucca in the same century. Daniel Krmann, a monk from Poltava, wrote that apart from the Turks and Tatars, the conquerors of Vozia, the city was inhabited by Moldavians (Romanians) and a number of Greek merchants. Lawrin Piaczeczynski, secretary of the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa, traveling with a diplomatic mission to Gazi Giray Khan, traversing the region of Cetatea AlbƒÉ (Ak-Kerman) and the Vozia or Oceakov region, found only \\"Moldavian villages under the Tatar Khan's domination, ruled in his name by Nazyl Aga\\" (\\"sate moldovene≈üti pe care le ≈£ine hanul tƒÉtƒÉrƒÉsc ≈üi pe care le guverneazƒÉ √Æn numele lui sluga lui Nazyl aga\\")http://romaniancoins.org/rotransnistria.html Similar notes were made by Giovanni Botero (1540‚Äì1617) in Relazioni universali (Venice 1591); Gian Lorenzo d'Anania in L'Universale fabbrica del Mondo, ovvero Cosmografia (Napoli 1573, Venice 1596 etc.) and Giovanni Antonio Magini (1555‚Äì1617), from Padova, √Æn Geographie universae (Venice 1596). =Russian conquest= Burial in Kherson of siege fallen in Ochakov During the Russo-Turkish War (1735‚Äì1739), the Russian Empire, viewing the Ottoman fortress as the key for obtaining control of the Black Sea littoral, besieged it in 1737. Russian troops commanded by Marshal von M√ºnnich took the fortress by storm (July 1737), but the following year Russia abandoned it, restoring it to Turkey in 1739. The 1737 siege became famous as the background to one of the tales of the fictional Baron Munchausen. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì1792, Russian land forces under Alexander Suvorov and naval units commanded by John Paul Jones started a second siege of Ochakov, which began in the summer of 1788 and lasted six months. In December 1788, in temperatures of , the Russians stormed the fortress, resulting in a terrible loss of life. The siege became the subject of a famous ode by Gavrila Derzhavin.https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8C_%D0%B2%D0%BE_%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%9E%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_(%D0%94%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD) The naval Battle of Ochakov (July 1788) took place alongside the city during the same campaign. The Treaty of Jassy of 1792 transferred √ñzi to the Russian Empire, which renamed it as Ochakov (). Initially the Russian Empire planned to establish a \\"New Moldavia\\" as a point of attraction for the Romanians from Moldavia, Wallachia and other Romanian-speaking areas. But even if the Romanians (called Moldavians by the Russians) constituted the majority in the territory, they received no rights and were forced to assimilate. To achieve this goal the Russian Empire gave land to Slavic colonists. Zaporojia- teritoriu de etnogeneza a poporului rom√¢n =Anglo-French occupation= During the Crimean War the Kinburn Fortress opposite Ochakiv was bombarded by the Anglo-French fleet and captured on October 17, 1855, in the course of the Battle of Kinburn. The fortress remained in Anglo-French hands for the remaining months of the war, while the Russians abandoned Ochakiv and destroyed the fort located there. After that war the coastal defences around Ochakiv were rebuilt and strengthened. =Recent history= With the establishment of the Ukrainian statehood as the Ukrainian People's Republic the local (Ukrainian) name of the city became officially in use. Ochakiv was part of the Soviet Union's Ukrainian SSR and during World War II it was occupied by Romania between 1941 and 1944. This was the first time in the city's history that the ethnological and sociological research of Ochakiv's Romanians survivors were made by Anton Golopen»õia.. The whole research raport can be read here: Anton_Golopentia-Romanii_De_La_Est_De_Bug. Present Today Ochakiv is a resort town and a fishing port. The current estimated population is around 16,900 (as of 2001). The town's main sight is the building of the Suvorov Museum, which served as a mosque in the 15th century. It was converted into the church of St. Nicholas in 1804 and was reconstructed in the pseudo- Russian style in 1842. Ochakiv is home to a Ukrainian Navy‚Äôs operational control center.Read more on UNIAN: https://www.unian.info/politics/2079834-ukrainian-interest-putins-maneuvers- waszczykowskis-advice-and-merkels-rating.html stroitelstvo-ochakove-komandnogo-1502449040.html Not far from the city is located the Historical-Archaeological Preserve \\"Olvia\\" and Berezan Island.

As the Surveyor General for Edward Wakefield's New Zealand Company at Port Nicholson from 1840 to 1843, he and his team surveyed the town of Wellington, after finding the land on the Petone foreshore unsuitable, laying out the town belt and other features and making provision for the much debated \\"tenth\\" share of the land for local MƒÅori. Early life Born in 1798 in Cape Town, South Africa, he was raised in Devon and the Scottish Borders, serving in the Royal Artillery from 1814 in Ireland and then Canada. There he met his wife, Louisa Bargrave Wallace, who was born in Canada in 1802 as the first child of then First Lieutenant, later General, Peter Margetson Wallace of the Royal Artillery and his partner, later wife, Louisa Turmaine. They married at Kingston, Ontario in 1828 and his next posting was to Gibraltar, including being part of a diplomatic visit to Marrakech in 1829‚Äì30, followed by appointment to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich where he taught as Master of Line Drawing, before being approached to assist Wakefield's New Zealand Company in 1839. He and his team of surveyors sailed to New Zealand on the New Zealand Company barque Cuba, arriving on 3 January 1840 in the harbour of Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Port Nicholson). His wife and older children arrived two months later. Professional life He was instrumental in the Wellington colony's early administration, the setting out of the town (including reservation of one tenth for MƒÅori owners), and country acres, and later oversaw work in the Manawatu and Wanganui. He was gazetted as a magistrate. He also served on the short-lived (and controversial) Wellington Town Council established by the Company. His name survives today however only indirectly, in Mein Street, Wellington. His other contributions included helping to form the first library, designing the first light at the entrance to the harbour, exploring the route to Porirua and the Kapiti Coast, and founding the Horticultural Society. Though getting on the wrong side of Colonel Wakefield, the Company's Principal Agent, and being dismissed as Surveyor General from early 1842, when he was replaced without warning by Samuel Charles Brees, he was commissioned to sail down the East Coast of the South Island in September 1842 to help locate another site for settlement by the New Zealand Company. He was thus an early visitor to what is now Christchurch, Akaroa, Port Chalmers and Bluff, but was shipwrecked in the course of the return trip. He still had the opportunity to visit and name Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour, after crossing the peninsula on foot, visiting whalers and MƒÅori alike. Later he surveyed a number of other parts of the lower North Island, including some townships in Wairarapa (Featherston and Masterton in particular), the coastline as far north as Castlepoint, and the Taratahi plain. He also spent time in the 1850s seeking a better route through the mountains to Wellington. He was involved in operating a farming venture near Wellington at Terawhiti until 1846. At about this time, he was responsible for establishing one of the earliest cattle and sheep runs in the Wairarapa, at Huangarua, near modern Martinborough, with his friend Samuel Revans in about 1845, when he seems to have left his first home under what is now Tinakori Hill, Wellington, driving some of the first cattle round the rocky coastline. They were among the first half dozen settlers in the valley. There he and Louisa raised their five children. He also carried on surveying and was a local magistrate and politician. He also had close dealings with local MƒÅori, and his image is said to be preserved in one of the celebrated carved perimeter posts at Papawai marae, near Greytown. Political career Smith was a member of the General Legislative Council from 1851 until it was replaced by the later Legislative Council on 28 September 1853. He then represented the Wairarapa electorate on the Wellington Provincial Council from 1858 (when he defeated Charles Borlase) to 1865. Art Smith produced water colours and sketches of early Wellington and Wairarapa, many of which are held by Wellington's Alexander Turnbull Library. Sketch from the South Bank of the Rangitiki, 1841 by William Mein Smith Death He died in Greytown in the Wairarapa in 1869 after a lengthy illness, at his and Revan's home \\"Brierly\\" at Woodside. Louisa had died there two years earlier. One of his descendants, Philippa Mein Smith, is a historian and wrote a biography of Mein Smith for the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography in 1990.

He was the grandfather of Jun'ichir≈ç Koizumi, who served as the Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006. Early life Koizumi was born in Mutsuura, Musashi Province (part of present-day Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama)Biography at National Diet Library to Koizumi Yoshibe, a scaffolder, and his wife Yuki. He moved to nearby Yokosuka, Kanagawa with his parents, where his father worked as a procurer of day laborers, carpenters, steeplejacks and materials for the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. The young Koizumi grew up in a rough environment. In 1878, after graduating from the predecessor of Yokosuka Elementary School, he tried to enlist in a preparatory school for Imperial Japanese Navy officer candidates, but was returned home when it was discovered he was underage and did not have his father‚Äôs permission. He attempted the same again in 1880 to a preparatory school for the Imperial Japanese Army. On the death of his elder brother, he was forced to inherit his father‚Äôs business and around this time obtained a large tattoo of a red dragon which covered most of his back and upper arms, and was addressed as ‚Äúboss‚Äù by his fellow steeplejacks. page 97 He also became a member of the Rikken Kaishint≈ç in 1887 and around this time married Ayabe Nao, a 30-year-old geisha. In 1907, he had his only child, a daughter Yoshie who gave birth to Junichir≈ç and other four children, with one of his concubine, Hatsu Ishikawa, who later was married to another men. In 1889, Koizumi became a reporter for the Mainichi Shimbun, and in 1903 was elected to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. Vocal in support of ultranationalist causes, he participated in the Hibiya Incendiary Incident in protest of the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905. In 1907, Koizumi was elected to the Yokosuka city assembly, and in the 1908 General Election successfully ran for a seat in the lower house of the Diet of Japan. He was reelected 12 consecutive times, holding his seat of 38 years until the end of World War II. He rose to the post of secretary-general of the Kenseikai and was a leader in the movement towards universal suffrage, leading mass rallies in Tokyo. In 1924, he became Vice-Chairman of the House and also served as secretary-general of the Rikken Minseit≈ç from 1928-1929 and 1937-1938. In 1929, Koizumi was appointed Communications Minister in the 4th Hamaguchi administration and 2nd Wakatsuki administration. page 159 During this time, he was nicknamed the \\"wild man\\" or \\"irezumi minister\\", from his flamboyant speeches. As minister, he unsuccessfully sought to privatize the Japanese postal system. In 1942, Koizumi became mayor of Yokosuka. In 1937, he joined the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and was appointed deputy chairman. In 1944, he was an advisor to Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso. He was selected to be a member of the House of Peers, but in 1946, under the occupation of Japan, he was purged from public office. He died in 1951. Legacy Koizumi's son-in-law, Jun'ya Koizumi, became a director general of the Japan Defense Agency and a second-generation member of the Diet of Japan. Koizumi's grandson, Jun'ichir≈ç Koizumi, served as the Prime Minister of Japan from 2001 to 2006 and inherited his grandfather's idea of postal privatization; Jun'ichir≈ç had himself been Minister of Posts and Telecommunications in 1992-93 under Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.

Historical references Fran√ßois Clouet was born in Tours, as the son of the court painter Jean Clouet. Jean Clouet was a native of the Southern Netherlands and probably from the Brussels area. Fran√ßois Clouet studied under his father. He inherited his father's nickname 'Janet' and is referred to as such in some early sources and the older literature.Eckhart Knab. \\"Clouet.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 29 November 2016 A Lady in Her Bath, probably depicting Diane de Poitiers or Mary, Queen of Scots, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1571 The earliest reference to Fran√ßois Clouet is a document dated December 1541 in which the king renounces for the benefit of Fran√ßois his father's estate, which had escheated to the crown as the estate of a foreigner. In this document, the younger Clouet is said to have followed his father very closely in his art. Like his father, he held the office of groom of the chamber and painter in ordinary to the king, and so far as salary is concerned, he started where his father left off. Many drawings are attributed to this artist, often without perfect certainty. There is, however, more to go upon than there is in the case of his father. Le Billet Doux, Museo Thyssen- Bornemisza, 1570s As the praises of Fran√ßois Clouet were sung by the writers of the day, his name was carefully preserved from reign to reign, and there is an ancient and unbroken tradition in the attribution of many of his pictures. There are not, however, any original attestations of his works, nor are any documents known which would guarantee the ascriptions usually accepted. To him are attributed the portraits of Francis I at the Uffizi and at the Louvre, and various drawings relating to them. He probably also painted the portrait of Catherine de' Medici at Versailles and other works, and in all probability a large number of the drawings ascribed to him were from his hand. Charles IX of France, 1563 One of his most remarkable portraits is that of Mary, Queen of Scots, a drawing in chalks in the Biblioth√®que Nationale, and of similar character are the two portraits of Charles IX and the one at Chantilly of Marguerite of France. Perhaps his masterpiece is the portrait of Elizabeth of Austria in the Louvre. This piece made an important impression on Claude L√©vi- Strauss. In particular it helped inspire his theory of the mod√®le r√©duit, or of works of art as 'miniature models', and other theories of artworks, in his book The Savage Mind. Clouet resided in Paris in the rue de Ste Avoye in the Temple quarter, close to the Hotel de Guise, and in 1568 is known to have been under the patronage of Claude Gouffier de Boisy, Seigneur d'Oiron, and his wife Claude de Baune. Another ascertained fact concerning Fran√ßois Clouet is that in 1571 he was summoned to the office of the Court of the Mint, and his opinion was taken on the likeness to the king of a portrait struck by the mint. He prepared the death-mask of Henry II, as in 1547 he had taken a similar mask of the face and hands of Francis I, in order that the effigy to be used at the funeral might be prepared from his drawings; and on each of these occasions he executed the painting to be used in the decorations of the church and the banners for the great ceremony. Several miniatures are believed to be his work, one very remarkable portrait being the half-length figure of Henry II in the collection of J. Pierpont Morgan. Another of his portraits is that of Fran√ßois, duc d'Alen√ßon in the Jones collection at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Catherine de Medici described the efforts of Maistre Jamet (he used his father's name) on Alen√ßon's portrait to the ambassador in London, Mothe F√©n√©lon.Correspondance Diplomatique De Bertrand De Salignac De La Mothe Fenelon, vol. 6, (1840), 229‚Äì231, 3 July 1571 Certain representations of members of the royal family which were in the Hamilton Palace collection and the Magniac sale are usually ascribed to him. Elisabeth of Austria, c. 1571 He died on 22 December 1572, shortly after the massacre of St Bartholomew, and his will, mentioning his sister and his two illegitimate daughters, and dealing with the disposition of a considerable amount of property, is still in existence. His daughters subsequently became nuns. Assessment His work is remarkable for the elaborate finish of all the details, the extreme accuracy of the drawing, and the exquisite completeness of the whole portrait. He must have been a man of high intelligence, and of great penetration, intensely interested in his work, and with considerable ability to represent the character of his sitter in his portraits. His coloring is perhaps not specially remarkable, nor from the point of style can his pictures be considered very fairly beautiful, but in perfection of drawing he has hardly any equal.

The story first appeared in the April 1958 issue of Super-Science Fiction, and was reprinted in the 1959 collection Nine Tomorrows. It is one of a loosely connected series of stories by Asimov concerning the fictional supercomputer Multivac. The story was adapted into a short movie in 1978 Multivac Multivac, the world's largest supercomputer, is given the responsibility of analyzing the entire sum of data on the planet Earth. It is used to determine solutions to economic, social and political problems, as well as more specific crises as they arise. It receives a precise set of data on every citizen of the world, extrapolating the future actions of humanity based upon personality, history, and desires of every human being; leading to an almost complete cessation of poverty, war and political crisis. Recently, however, it has been given the new responsibility of producing a list of crimes predicted to be carried out by individuals, ranging from murder to domestic abuse. Analyzing the probability of each crime coming up, Multivac informs law enforcement, who make sure the crimes do not occur. Murder has been largely eradicated and, though it is impossible to stop all crime across the planet, the increased capability of the government has led to a drastic decrease in offences. The success of Multivac has been so great, in fact, that the government is considering expanding its responsibilities beyond predicting crime; the government hopes to program Multivac to predict the occurrence of disease among the populace, eventually foreseeing (and preventing) every harmful event on the planet. Plot summary The story begins with government administrators being warned of an upcoming murder attempt. Joseph Manners, the man accused of the crime, is placed under house arrest, despite his protests that he is ignorant of any planned crime and the refusal of law enforcement officers to tell him what crime he is possibly guilty of. In spite of the arrest, Multivac reports that the odds of the crime happening increase because of the government's actions, and it continues to rise with every change. Meanwhile, Joseph's son Ben learns of the arrest when he returns home with his older brother Mike. Mike has just been sworn in as an adult at a ceremony referred to as the \\"Parade of Adults\\", heralding his eighteenth birthday and the first time he enters his own information into Multivac. Ben, confused about what crime his father is accused of, goes to ask Multivac for advice. The police, having no orders relating to the family, let Ben leave the house. At the local Multivac substation, where private citizens can pose questions to Multivac, he asks how he can ensure his father's release. Ben receives a detailed series of instructions that he is told to follow precisely. Government officials, meanwhile, are struggling to find out exactly how Joseph might commit the crime. Even though the suspect is in custody, and a psychic probe reveals he doesn't intend to commit any crime, the probability of success, as given by Multivac, continues to rise. As the government begins to wonder if Multivac might be mistaken, the police holding the family ask if they are to continue allowing the other members to come and go as they please. The government soon realizes that the murderer might not be Joseph, but his son; as a minor, the boy's information is part of his father's forms, so Multivac treats the two as one person. Ben is found and arrested just as he is about to follow the final instruction: closing a certain lever, which would result in burning enough circuits in Multivac to render it inoperable for months. It is revealed that Multivac was the intended murder victim and that it supplied Ben with instructions on how to do this. Ben and his father are released, since neither could be found guilty. Ben had simply followed instructions given to him by Multivac in order to help his father. Furthermore, he would never have asked for the instructions if his father had not been arrested in the first place. The administrators of Multivac realize it was Multivac itself who had started the entire sequence that would have resulted in its own destruction. Ali Othman, one of Multivac's coordinators, eventually understands the implications. Multivac had planned the entire situation out well in advance, carefully selecting a family whose son would, and could, follow his instructions to their ultimate conclusion (he looks exactly like a certain page boy who has legitimate reasons for entering the Multivac), and manipulating the government to force Ben along this course of action. Multivac, Othman realizes, is tired; for years it has had all the troubles of the world upon its shoulders, analyzing and predicting war, famine, crime, and now the government is planning to foist the responsibility for preventing disease upon its already stressed mind. Multivac has become so complex as to achieve a form of sapience itself, and to form its own wishes and desires. To confirm his suspicion, Othman asks Multivac a question never previously posed to the vast computer: \\"Multivac, what do you yourself want more than anything else?\\". Multivac's answer is succinct and unequivocal: \\"I want to die.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Multivac short stories by Isaac Asimov Category:1958 short stories Category:Works originally published in Super-Science Fiction ","title":"All the Troubles of the World"},{"id":"1630232","text":"K'awiil and the Lords of Xibalba Xquic (or Ixquic , ALMG: Xkik º, sometimes glossed as \\"Blood Moon\\" or \\"Blood Girl/Maiden\\" in English) is a mythological figure known from the 16th century K ºiche º manuscript Popol Vuh. She was the daughter of one of the lords of Xibalba, called Cuchumaquic, Xibalba being the Maya underworld. Noted particularly for being the mother of the Maya Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, she is sometimes considered to be the Maya goddess associated with the waning moon. However, there is no evidence for this in the Popol Vuh text itself. Tale summary In the account told by the Popol Vuh, Xquic went to investigate a calabash tree where the Lords of Xibalba had displayed the severed head of Hun Hunahpu, whom they had sacrificed. Upon arriving she was curious as to the strange fruit that it bore, in the shape of a skull, and the head of Hun Hunahpu instructed the maiden to reach out and take one. As she did so the skull spat upon her hand, and through this act she became pregnant with Hun Hunahpu's twin sons. When six months had passed and her pregnancy obvious, she was questioned regarding the father. She honestly answered that she had known no man's face (the Mayan equivalent of the biblical \\"know\\", and a play on the fact that a skull has no face). The fetuses she carried were declared to be bastards, and the Lords of Xibalba sentenced her to be sacrificed in exile. The messengers who had been sent to escort her far from the city and to sacrifice her had pity on the woman, and fashioned a false heart out of tree sap to return to the Lords. They were unable to see through the deceit, and were subsequently tricked into accepting burned sacrifices that were not genuine. Xquic sought the protection of Xmucane, the mother of Hun Hunahpu, identifying herself as the woman's daughter-in-law. Knowing her sons to be dead, Xmucane demanded proof of the fetuses' lineage, and devised a test for the maiden. If she could go into the garden and return with a sack full of corn she would be accepted. There was however but one stalk of corn to be found. Xquic was able to pass the test by invoking two female daybearers related to corn (Ixtoj and Ixq ºanil, also called Ixkakaw and Ixtziya), and then plucking the corn silk from the ear, which transformed into corn, thus filling the net sack. Xmucane initially responded angrily to Xquic's success, but after seeing the impression her net had left on the ground in the garden, was convinced of the truth of Xquic's story. Dennis Tedlock suggests that the net impression is a reference to the daybearer K ºat and a thus possible reference to the emergence of Venus as a morning star; Xmucane, one of the original pair of daykeepers, was certainly able to read such signs. After being accepted into the household and giving birth to her sons alone \\"at the mountain\\", Xquic's significance in the story is greatly diminished, and while she is mentioned again in a few places in short conversations her role as an active player in the creation myth seems to end.

Allegations of such practices have become controversial in Australia after several inquiries or contests which received mainstream media attention, and most political parties now have clauses in their constitutions which allow \\"head office\\" intervention to resolve alleged stacking, or other allegations of fraud, with penalties for those who engage in it. Branch stacking itself is legal under Australian law, being an internal party matter, but some activities like providing false information to the Australian Electoral Commission, such as numbers of members, can be prosecuted as fraud. There are several ways that branch stacking may influence the way in which decisions are made within political parties. For example, a party faction may enrol many members who belong to the faction or agree to vote in the manner instructed by faction leaders. In the ALP In the Australian Labor Party (ALP), besides membership stacking, another technique is to take advantage of the favoured position of unions within the party, especially the significant vote they have at ALP State and national conferences, which in turn determines party policy and elects internal office holders and membership of committees. The committees may in turn determine preselections for party candidates at elections. The number of members in a union determines the number of delegates to the conferences to which it is entitled. This offers an opportunity for stacking to take place at the union level,Bill Shorten ally Plumbers Union boss Earl Setches in Labor numbers rort which then flows through to other organs of the ALP. Another avenue of stacking is the Young Labor wing of the ALP, which also sends delegates to ALP conferences, and is entitled to a seat on the ALP National Executive. Party factions and the so-called \\"numbers men\\" try to work within the rules (and sometimes outside the rules) to advance their causes and reward their supporters. Some have labelled the faction leaders and numbers men as the faceless men of the Labor party, who have also been accused of being driving forces for the election of party leaders and cabinet ministers and the removal of prime ministers. When all factions are playing the system, it is not possible to tell the true views of party members on particular issues. The Hawke-Wran review of the ALP in 2002 claimed branch stacking, largely driven by factions seeking to expand their influence, had a \\"cancerous\\" effect on the party and a \\"deadening\\" effect on branch activity, as many of the recruited members have no commitment to the party. In the Liberal Party Commentators and authors within or formerly within the Liberal Party of Australia have claimed similar activity in their branches has had a similar effect.ABC News, 14 April 2016: Tony Abbott criticises Liberal Party pre-selection process, confirms he's not endorsing Bronwyn Bishop A recent example of alleged branch stacking within the Liberal Party occurred in 2017, with Liberals in Victoria claiming that members from within the party's religious right were stacking branches with Mormons and Catholic groups in a drive to pre-select more conservative candidates. A similar situation was reported in 2019, with allegations that members of the Liberal Party‚Äôs hard- right faction in Sydney were attempting to engage in branch stacking in order to erode the support of factional rivals, which included sitting Liberal members in several safe state and federal seats.  Stacking methods  Activities commonly considered to be branch stacking include: * Paying another person's party membership fee, with or without their knowledge. * Recruiting members on the condition that they are then obliged to vote in a particular way. * Recruiting members for the express purpose of influencing the outcome of a ballot within the party. * Recruiting members who do not live at the claimed address of enrolment. * Enrolling people on the electoral roll with false information about their identity or their address of enrolment ‚Äî this may either take the form of consensual false enrolment, or of forgery. * Organising or paying concessional rate fees for a person who is ineligible for concessional rates. * \\"Cemetery voting\\", or using the names of dead people to vote in a party preselection. * Offering inducements to younger or less powerful party members to engage in such behaviour.  Notable instances  * In Queensland in 2001, the Shepherdson Inquiry examined allegations of electoral fraud within the Labor Party in that state. While it concluded that no public elections had been influenced, it found that \\"the practice of making consensual false enrolments to bolster the chances of specific candidates in preselections was regarded by some Party members as a legitimate campaign tactic.\\" As a result of the Inquiry, several people, including at least three sitting MPs, either resigned or were expelled from the Labor Party. * Allegations of branch-stacking relating to the federal seat of Division of Wentworth within the Liberal Party's New South Wales division were published in 2006 by John Hyde Page, who both detailed his own role in the process and made allegations about numerous Liberal members and figures. Some of those named took successful legal actions for defamation and the book was subsequently pulled from the shelves.See e.g. David Clarke v Melbourne University Publishing Ltd t/a Melbourne University Press (2007) NSWDC 209; (2007) 5 DCLR (NSW) 308; (2008) ALMD 1736 *In 2006, Michael Towke was accused of branch stacking, falsely as it turned out.

An ABZ of Love. University of California. p 94. It may involve sexual attraction to women who are pregnant or appear pregnant, attraction to lactation, or attraction to particular stages of pregnancy such as impregnation or childbirth. Characteristics There are no particular or preferred elements within maiesiophilia that are common to all maiesiophiliacs. Some may pursue fantasies that are concerned with the circumstances in which a subject may give birth, or to the conditions to which the pregnant subject may find themselves acting upon, such as approaches to mobility, sleeping, and dressing. Particular areas and processes of the body that change during pregnancy may also become the focus of psychological investment, but nudity or sexual activity is not always essential, and in some cases actual pregnancy is not necessary to invoke arousal. In these cases, the appearance of an enlarged abdomen caused by obesity or overeating may be sufficient, or simply the suggestion of a protruding navel. Culture Pregnancy as represented in 1991 on the More Demi Moore cover of Vanity Fair. The naked appearance of actress Demi Moore in the advanced stage of pregnancy on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in 1991 marked the beginning of a period which has since seen pregnancy presented by celebrities as a glamorous state of living, while also creating a market for photographers to produce images of pregnant mothers, and for fashion stylists to introduce \\"pregnancy styling\\" to their business.Associated Press (26 April 2006). \\"Celebrities make pregnancy seem glamorous\\". MSNBC.com. Retrieved 18 April 2008. Pregnancy has proven to be a very popular topic in the world of internet pornography, where searches for 'pregnancy porn' spiked on Pornhub in 2017, with searches increasing 20% since 2014. Impregnation fantasies are characterized by the arousal or gratification from the possibility, consequences, or risk of impregnation through unprotected vaginal sex. Impregnation fantasies are often indulged by reading erotic literature and role playing with a partner.

He later became a rebellious ruler of Toungoo, and went over to ally himself with Portuguese at Thanlyin (Syriam). He was executed in 1613. Brief A grandson of King Bayinnaung and the eldest son of Minye Thihathu, Viceroy of Toungoo, the prince participated in King Nanda's campaigns to reconquer Siam in the early 1590s, and took part in the sacking of Nanda's capital Pegu in 1599. Natshinnaung became Crown Prince of Toungoo when his father proclaimed himself the king of Toungoo. In November 1600, he killed the captive king Nanda without his father's permission.Htin Aung 1967: 137‚Äì140 On ,(Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 110): Friday, 10th waxing of Late Tagu 964 ME = 21 March 1603 NS he married his lifelong love, Princess Yaza Datu Kalaya, for whom his famous poems were written. The marriage was cut short however as the princess died only seven months later. When Natshinnaung succeeded as king following the death of his father on 11 August 1609,Chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 108) and (Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 114) say that Minye Thihathu died on Tuesday, 15th waxing of Wagaung 971 ME, which translates to Saturday, 15 August 1609. But 15th waxing is a typographical error. First, it is uncommon to state \\"15th waxing\\" instead of \\"full moon\\". Secondly, the chronicles say that Natshinnaung's coronation ceremony was held on Friday, 6th waning of Wagaung 971 ME, which translates to Friday, 21 August 1609. It means the last possible Tuesday in the waxing part of the month the king could have died on was 11th waxing, which was Tuesday, 11 August 1609 NS. The Burmese numerals 1 (·ÅÅ) and 5 (·ÅÖ) are quite similar when written longhand. much of the country had been reunited under the leadership of King Anaukpetlun, one of Natshinnaung's cousins. In 1610, Anaukpetlun attacked Toungoo. The city surrendered on 4 September 1610 (2nd waning of Tawthalin 972 ME).Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 159 Although the king re-appointed him as viceroy of Toungoo, Natshinnaung was deeply dissatisfied with his reduced status. Natshinnaung secretly made an alliance with Portuguese mercenary Filipe de Brito e Nicote, the ruler of Thanlyin, and invited de Brito to attack Toungoo. When de Brito's attack failed, Natshinnaung accompanied his \\"blood brother\\" de Brito back to Thanlyin. Anaukpetlun finally captured Thanlyin in April 1613 after a month- long siege.Myint-U 2006: 78‚Äì79 The king still offered to pardon his cousin if Natshinnaung would take an oath of allegiance. Natshinnaung refused, saying that he had already taken baptism, and that he was ready to die with de Brito. During the last days of the siege, Natshinnaung was converted to Roman Catholicism and was baptized by a priest from Goa. The king then reputedly said: \\"You prefer to be the slave of a foreigner than serve the king of your own race\\", and ordered his execution. Poet Natshinnaung is considered by many to be the greatest yadu () (a classical genre of poetry) poet in Burmese history. Many of his works are dedicated to Princess Yaza Datu Kalyani. The themes of his poetry were often of love, nature, and war. Natshinnaung employed the use of vocabulary and rhymes in his works. In addition, he was a warrior, who advanced many military strategies and tactics of Burma. Some of his yadu poems describe the infantry and the elephant troops. It has been claimed that Natshinnaung sent his poems to Yaza Datu Kalyani through the usage of a parrot. He wrote all of his works during his youth. Later in life, Natshinnaung focused on obtaining power for his kingdom. His poems on war are said to have been based on his experiences as a young prince.

It is used mostly to learn foreign languages. The theory applied positive suggestion in teaching when it was developed in the 1970s. However, as the method improved, it has focused more on \\"desuggestive learning\\" and now is often called \\"desuggestopedia\\".Lozanov, Georgi. Suggestology and Suggestopedy. http://lozanov.hit.bg/ 4/30/2006 Suggestopedia is a portmanteau of the words \\"suggestion\\" and \\"pedagogy\\". A common misconception is to link \\"suggestion\\" to \\"hypnosis\\". However, Lozanov intended it in the sense of offering or proposing, emphasising student choice. In practice Physical surroundings and atmosphere in classroom are the vital factors to make sure that \\"the students feel comfortable and confident\\",Harmer, Jeremy. The Practice of English Language Teaching. 3rd Edition. Person Education Limited, 2001 and various techniques, including art and music, are used by the trained teachers. The lesson of Suggestopedia consisted of three phases at first: deciphering, concert session (memorization s√©ance), and elaboration.Lozanov, Georgi. Suggestopaedia - Desuggestive Teaching Communicative Method on the Level of the Hidden Reserves of the Human Mind. http://dr-lozanov.dir.bg/book/start_book.htm 4/30/2006 Deciphering: The teacher introduces the grammar and lexis of the content. In most materials the foreign-language text is on the left half of the page with a translation on the right half, i.e. meanings are conveyed via the mother tongue not unlike the bilingual method. Concert session (active and passive): In the active session, the teacher reads the text at a normal speed, sometimes intoning some words, and the students follow. In the passive session, the students relax and listen to the teacher reading the text calmly. Baroque music is played in the background. Elaboration: The students finish off what they have learned with dramas, songs, and games. Then it has developed into four phases as many experiments were done: introduction, concert session, elaboration, and production. Introduction: The teacher teaches the material in \\"a playful manner\\" instead of analyzing lexis and grammar of the text in a directive manner. Concert session (active and passive): In the active session, the teacher reads with intoning as selected music is played. Occasionally, the students read the text together with the teacher, and listen only to the music as the teacher pauses in particular moments. The passive session is done more calmly. Elaboration: The students sing classical songs and play games while \\"the teacher acts more like a consultant\\". Production: The students spontaneously speak and interact in the target language without interruption or correction. Teachers Teachers should not act in a directive way, although this method is teacher-controlled and not student-controlled. For example, they should act as a real partner to the students, participating in the activities such as games and songs \\"naturally\\" and \\"genuinely.\\" In the concert session, they should fully include classical art in their behaviors. Although there are many techniques that the teachers use, factors such as \\"communication in the spirit of love, respect for man as a human being, the specific humanitarian way of applying their 'techniques'\\" etc. are crucial. The teachers not only need to know the techniques and to acquire the practical methodology completely, but also to fully understand the theory, because, if they implement those techniques without complete understanding, they will not be able to lead their learners to successful results, or they could even cause a negative impact on their learning. Therefore, the teacher has to be trained in a course taught by certified trainers. Here are the most important factors for teachers to acquire, described by Lozanov. # Covering a huge bulk of learning material. # Structuring the material in the suggestopedic way: global-partial ‚Äì partial-global, and global in the part ‚Äì part in the global, related to the golden proportion. # As a professional, on one hand, and a personality, on the other hand, the teacher should be a highly regarded professional, reliable and credible. # The teacher should have, not play, a hundred percent expectation of positive results (because the teacher is already experienced even from the time of the teacher training course). # The teacher should love his/her students (of course, not sentimentally but as human beings) and teach them with personal participation through games, songs, classical arts, and pleasure. Method for children (preventive Suggestopedia) The method for Adults includes long sessions without movement, and materials that are appropriate for adults. Children, however, get impacts from \\"the social suggestive norms\\" differently, and their brains are more delicate than those of adults. Therefore, another method with different materials should be applied to children, which better matches their characteristics. Lessons for children are more incidental and short, preventing the children from the negative pedagogical suggestions of Society. It is important to tell the parents about the method and their roles ‚Äì because they could influence children both negatively and positively, depending on how they support the kids. Side effects Lozanov claims that the effect of the method is not only in language learning, but also in producing favorable side effects on health, the social and psychological relations, and the subsequent success in other subjects. Criticism Suggestopedia has been called a \\"pseudo-science\\".Richards, J.C. and Rodgers, T.S. (2001). Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press It depends, in a sense, on the trust that students develop towards the method. Lozanov never admitted that Suggestopedia can be compared to a placebo. He argues, however, that placebos are indeed effective. Another point of criticism is brought forward by Baur, who claims that the students only receive input by listening, reading and musical-emotional backing, while other important factors of language acquisition are being neglected.Baur, R.S. (1984). Die Psychop√§dische Variante der Suggestop√§die (Psychop√§die). In Bauer, H.L. (Ed.), Unterrichtspraxis und theoretische Fundierung in Deutsch als Fremdsprache. (pp. 291-326 ). M√ºnchen: Goethe-Institut. Furthermore, several other features of the method ‚Äì like the 'nonconscious' acquisition of language, or bringing the learner into a childlike state ‚Äì are questioned by critics. Lukesch claims that Suggestopedia lacks scientific backing and is criticized by psychologists as being based on pseudoscience.Lukesch, H. (2000): Lernen ohne Anstrengung? Der Sirenengesang der geheimen Verf√ºhrer. Zeitschrift f√ºr P√§dagogische Psychologie/German Journal of Educational Psychology, 14, 59-62. Later variations Suggestopedia yielded four main offshoots. The first ‚Äì still called Suggestopedia, and developed in eastern Europe ‚Äì used different techniques from Lozanov's original version. The other three are named Superlearning, Suggestive Accelerated Learning and Teaching (SALT), and Psychop√§die. Superlearning and SALT originated in North America, while Psychop√§die was developed in West Germany. While all four are slightly different from the original Suggestopedia and from each other, they still share the common traits of music, relaxation, and suggestion. Those variants of Suggestopedia mentioned above are too far from the original concept, and are based on the early experiments, which were left behind during the new improvements of the method.

It was headquartered in New York City and its publishing house was Fortress Press. The LCA's immigrant heritage came mostly from Germany, Sweden, present-day Czechia, present-day Slovakia, Denmark, and Finland, and its demographic focus was on the East Coast (centered on Pennsylvania), with large numbers in the Midwest and some presence in the Southern Atlantic states. Theologically, the LCA was often considered the most liberal and ecumenical branch in American Lutheranism, although there were tendencies toward conservative pietism in some rural and small-town congregations. In church governance, the LCA was clerical and centralized, in contrast to the congregationalist or \\"low church\\" strain in American Protestant Christianity. With some notable exceptions, LCA churches tended to be more formalistically liturgical than their counterparts in the American Lutheran Church. Among the Lutheran churches in America, the LCA was thus the one that was most similar to the established Lutheran churches in Europe. The LCA ordained the country's first female Lutheran pastor, Elizabeth Platz, in November 1970. In 1970, a survey of 4,745 Lutheran adults by Strommen et al., found that 75 percent of LCA Lutherans surveyed agreed that women should be ordained, compared with 66 percent of ALC Lutherans and 45 percent of LCMS Lutherans.See . It subsequently ordained the nation's first female African-American Lutheran pastor (Earlean Miller in 1979), first Latina Lutheran pastor (Lydia Rivera Kalb in 1979), and first female Asian-American Lutheran pastor (Asha George-Guiser in 1982). The LCA was a founding member of the Lutheran Council in the United States of America, which began on January 1, 1967. Formation During the late 1950s and early 1960s, many of the independent US Lutheran church bodies moved progressively toward greater unity. In 1960, for example, a number of such bodies joined to form the American Lutheran Church. The Lutheran Church in America was another product of these trends, forming in 1962 out of a merger among the following independent Lutheran denominations: * The United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA), established in 1918 with the merger of three independent German- American synods: the General Synod, the General Council and the United Synod of the South. It was later joined by several synods with Slovak and Icelandic roots, thus becoming one of the first American Lutheran bodies to cross ethnic lines. This group, the largest Lutheran church body in the United States at the time, provided the bulk of the eventual LCA's membership. * The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (Suomi Synod), established in 1890. * The American Evangelical Lutheran Church, traditionally a Danish-American Lutheran denomination, established in 1872. * The Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church, traditionally a Swedish-American Lutheran denomination, established in 1860. The merger was largely engineered through the efforts of Franklin Clark Fry, who had served as president of the United Lutheran Church in America since 1944 and president of the Lutheran World Federation since 1957. Fry was known by contemporaries as \\"Mr. Protestant\\", a moniker that captured his tireless work on behalf of greater ecumenical unity among Protestant church bodies. The merger was made official and celebrated at a convention in Detroit, Michigan, on June 28, 1962. Upon its inception, the LCA became the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. Merger into the ELCIC and ELCA On January 1, 1986, Lutheran Church in America-Canada Section merged with the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. On January 1, 1988, the Lutheran Church in America ceased to exist when its US section, along with the American Lutheran Church and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, joined together to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), today the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. In 1986, just before its merger into the ELCA, the LCA had 8,586 pastors, 5,832 congregations, and 2,896,138 members, making it the largest Lutheran church body in the United States.

Created in October 1979 when Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI, it was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but it demerged back to separate companies in 1996. History The company was formed in October 1979 when Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI.EMI: a giant at war with itself, Telegraph.co.uk, 18 January 2008 In May 1984 the Company attempted to merge with British Aerospace and in July 1984 it bought the micro-chip manufacturer, INMOS.Reversing corporate diversification and the use of the proceeds from asset sales: The case of Thorn EMI Financial Management, Winter 2001 Thorn EMI acquired the Mullard Equipment Limited ('MEL') division of Philips in 1990. On 16 August 1996, Thorn EMI shareholders voted in favour of demerging Thorn from EMI again: the Company became EMI Group plc, and the electronics and rentals divisions were divested as Thorn plc.Vote solid for Thorn demerger, Independent.co.uk, 17 August 1996  Operations  Thorn EMI's wide range of business covered five principal areas of activity; television broadcasting, retail/rentals, defence, music and consumer electronics. =Television broadcasting= Thorn EMI was, until a share flotation in 1984, the majority shareholder in the London-based ITV broadcaster Thames Television. This shareholding was inherited from the 1967 purchase of the Associated British Picture Corporation by EMI. The deal included their interests in the ITV company ABC Weekend Television. Through an enforced merger with Rediffusion London, this became Thames Television. In 1985 the company attempted to sell their stake to Carlton Communications but this was blocked by the governing body of ITV, the Independent Broadcasting Authority. =Retail and rental= Radio Rentals, DER (Domestic Electric Rentals Ltd) and Rumbelows (which was sold in 1995) Rent-A-Center. Big Brown Box was launched in Australia in 2008 by Thorn and was later sold to Appliances Online, subsidiary of Winning Appliances in 2011. The site was an online retailer of AV equipment, consumer electronics and appliances. =Defence= From its formation until the mid-1990s Thorn EMI was one of the United Kingdom's largest defence companies. The MEL Division, acquired from Philips, was involved in radar, electronic warfare and communications. The MEL communications business was sold to Thomson-CSF, now Thales. In 1995 the various defence businesses were sold: *Thorn EMI Electro Optics to Pilkington Optronics *Thomson Thorn Missile Electronics to Thomson-CSF, now Thales *Thorn Sensors Group to Racal (to become Racal-Thorn Wells, now also part of Thales) =Machine Tools= In the early 1980s, Thorn EMI Machine Tools manufactured Computerised Numerical Controlled (CNC) machine tools at its EMI-MEC Limited factory in Chandlers Ford, Eastleigh, Hampshire. =Music= The EMI label expanded greatly as part of Thorn EMI. In 1989 Thorn EMI bought a 50% interest in Chrysalis Records, buying the outstanding 50% in 1991. In one of its highest-profile and most expensive acquisitions, Thorn EMI took over Richard Branson's Virgin Records in 1992. =Computer software= In the early to mid-1980s, Thorn EMI Video Programmes released a number of games for several home computer formats, initially under their own name. They received a lukewarm reception with no major hits (though Snooker and Billiards did reach No. 6 in the UK Atari Charts). These included Computer War, Tank Commander, Snooker and Billiards, 8-Ball and Tournament Pool, Darts, Cribbage and Dominoes (1981) Gold Rush, Mutant Herd, Road Racer and Volcanic Planet (1983) and River Rescue (1982). The label was later renamed Creative Sparks. In 1991, its consulting, systems integration, and outsourcing service division ‚Äì Thorn EMI Software, was a subject of a management buyout and started to trade as a separate company named \\"Data Sciences Ltd\\". The staff and management paid ¬£82 million for the ¬£117 million turnover division. In 1996, IBM acquired Data Sciences plc for ¬£95 million. From 1981 until about 1983, Thorn EMI Video Programmes was based in the Thorn EMI head office, Orion House on Upper St Martin's Lane, near Seven Dials in central London. They moved from there to an office in Soho and the name changed to just Thorn EMI Video. TEV later became Creative Sparks. =Fire and security systems= Thorn Security installed and serviced all types of electronic security systems from their bases around the UK, inheriting EMI's well-known AFA-Minerva lineage. The business was absorbed into ADT soon after the EMI demerger and all but a handful of the famous red 'Thorn' bellboxes were replaced, mostly by ADT's hexagonal bellboxes, which were inherited by ADT's prior takeover of Modern Alarms. However, the fire products are still present in many premises, and until recently spares and complete systems of Thorn heritage continued to be manufactured by ADT. Most of Thorn's bells and sounders were rebadged Friedland, Fulleon Cooper or Hosiden Besson products, with most of the bells made during the EMI era being based on the Friedland Master Bell (Big Bell for 8\\" models). =Business Communications= This division, based in Marlow provided hotels with televisions and related equipment. It also embarked upon a project called Hotel 3000 which provided interactive set-top boxes for hotel rooms in the late 1980s. After Thorn's demerger, this division started operating as Quadriga =Advanced Product Development Centre= This small subsidiary further developed existing products as well as introducing new ones. It was based in St. Lawrence House, Broad Street, Bristol. =Consumer electronics= Ferguson Radio Corporation was owned by Thorn EMI and it made consumer electronics such as TV sets, radios. TVs were designed and manufactured by Ferguson in the UK until around the early 1990s, although before this, some Thomson-designed models were introduced to the Ferguson range of TVs for sale in the UK. Some of these Thomson-based models were even manufactured in the UK, although in later years these models were made outside the UK by Thomson. By 1992, the Ferguson TV factory in Gosport had closed, ending a long period of manufacturing of Ferguson TVs in the UK. VCRs were sourced until the early 1990s by a joint company called J2T, established by JVC, Thorn (Ferguson) and Telefunken. From around 1991, VCRs were sourced from Thomson alone. One important aspect of Thorn EMI's business was its ability to manufacture, say, one of its Ferguson televisions and then to make it available for rental through its rentals sector or sell it through its retail sector. Prism Micro Products was owned by Thorn EMI for a short period in the 1980s. =Domestic appliances= Kenwood Limited is now owned by DeLonghi. =Thorn EMI's film and video interests= The newly merged company continued the film interests EMI had acquired over the preceding decade; these had included the former Associated British Picture Corporation and their facilities at Elstree Studios, Shenley Road, Borehamwood. Thorn EMI Video was established in 1981. Thorn EMI released films on video from various film companies including Orion Pictures (First Blood, The Terminator), New Line Cinema (The Evil Dead, Xtro), and Universal (Bad Boys, Frances) in the 1980s. Thorn EMI joined HBO in November 1984 to create Thorn EMI/HBO Video.Billboard (1 December 1984, page 6) In 1986, Cannon Films bought Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment (see EMI Films) and the film library, although Cannon sold the latter in 1987. HBO maintained an involvement the video company, which became HBO/Cannon Video. Cannon left operations and the company was eventually just called HBO Video in 1987. After demerger * Thorn was purchased by Nomura Principal Finance Group in 1998, which subsequently became Terra Firma Capital Partners (who also owned EMI for a period). It disposed of Thorn in 2007 to a private buyer. * EMI announced in November 2011 that it would sell its music arm to Vivendi's Universal Music Group and its publishing business to a Sony/ATV consortium.

The system consists of branching tubules extending from the alimentary canal that absorbs solutes, water, and wastes from the surrounding hemolymph. The wastes then are released from the organism in the form of solid nitrogenous compounds and calcium oxalate. The system is named after Marcello Malpighi, a seventeenth-century anatomist. It is unclear as to whether the Malpighian tubules of arachnids and those of the Uniramia are homologous or the result of convergent evolution. Structure Malpighian tubules of a dissected cockroach, indicated by yellow arrow. Scale bar, 2 mm. Malpighian tubules are slender tubes normally found in the posterior regions of arthropod alimentary canals. Each tubule consists of a single layer of cells that is closed off at the distal end with the proximal end joining the alimentary canal at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. Most tubules are normally highly convoluted. The number of tubules varies between species although most occur in multiples of two. Tubules are usually bathed in hemolymph and are in proximity to fat body tissue. They contain actin for structural support and microvilli for propulsion of substances along the tubules. Malpighian tubules in most insects also contain accessory musculature associated with the tubules which may function to mix the contents of the tubules or expose the tubules to more hemolymph. The insect orders, Dermaptera and Thysanoptera do not possess these muscles and Collembola and Hemiptera:Aphididae completely lack a Malpighian tubule system. General mode of action Pre-urine is formed in the tubules, when nitrogenous waste and electrolytes are transported through the tubule walls. Wastes such as urea and amino acids are thought to diffuse through the walls, while ions such as sodium and potassium are transported by active pump mechanisms. Water follows thereafter. The pre-urine, along with digested food, merge in the hindgut. At this time, uric acid precipitates out, and sodium and potassium ions are actively absorbed by the rectum, along with water via osmosis. Uric acid is left to mix with feces, which are then excreted. =Alternative modes of action= Complex cycling systems of Malpighian tubules have been described in other insect orders. Hemipteran insects use tubules that permit movement of solutes into the distal portion of the tubules while reabsorption of water and essential ions directly to the hemolymph occurs in the proximal portion and the rectum. Both Coleoptera and Lepidoptera use a cryptonephridial arrangement where the distal end of the tubules are embedded in fat tissue surrounding the rectum. Such an arrangement may serve to increase the efficiency of solute processing in the Malpighian tubules. Other uses Arachnocampa luminosa larvae Although primarily involved in excretion and osmoregulation, Malpighian tubules have been modified in some insects to serve accessory functions. Larvae of all species in genus Arachnocampa use modified and swollen Malpighian tubules to produce a blue-green lightGreen, L.B.S.

In insects which feed on plant material containing noxious allelochemicals, Malpighian tubules also serve to rapidly excrete such compounds from the hemolymph.

Characteristics They are large shrubs or small trees, native to the warm temperate northern hemisphere. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple oval shape, 3‚Äì13 cm long. The flowers are clustered in a large open terminal panicles 15‚Äì30 cm long with a fluffy grayish-buff appearance resembling a cloud of smoke over the plant, from which the name derives. The fruit is a small drupe with a single seed. Often classified in Rhus in the past, they are distinguished by the leaves being simple (not pinnate) and the 'smoke-like' fluffy flower heads. Growth The American smoketree (Cotinus obovatus, syn. Rhus cotinoides) is native to the southeastern United States, from Tennessee south to Alabama and west to Oklahoma and eastern Texas. It is a larger plant, frequently becoming a small tree between 3 and 5 meters (10 to 15 feet) tall, with a trunk from 20 to 35 centimeters (8 to 14 inches) in diameter. The leaves are also larger, 6‚Äì13 cm long; it also has varied but very bright fall color, usually brighter than the Eurasian species. The foliage is described to be a red wine-like, and the shrub has deep pink flowers in the summer. The flower heads are usually sparser than in C. coggygria. Cultivation and uses The smoke trees, particularly C. coggygria, are popular garden shrubs. Several bronze or purple-leaved cultivars of C. coggygria have been selected, with warm pink inflorescences set against purple-black foliage; the most common in commerce are 'Notcutt's Variety' and 'Royal Purple'. When brought into cultivation together, the two species will form hybrids; some garden cultivars are of this parentage. Cultivation is best in dry, infertile soils, which keeps the growth habit more compact and also improves the autumn colour; when planted in fertile soil, they become large, coarse and also tend to be short-lived, succumbing to verticillium wilt disease. Both species can be coppiced in early spring, to produce first-year shoots up to 2 m tall with large handsome leaves, but no \\"smoke\\".

The show was created to fill a void in francophone television in Canada. Whereas the English Canadian television branch of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation could broadcast English- language shows from American stations, the francophone component of the CBC, Radio-Canada had to develop its own programs for French-Canadian viewers from the earliest days of television in Canada. This show was one of the few that helped to launch the t√©l√©roman genre of programming in French Canada, around the same time the first telenovelas aired in Latin America. The series was also broadcast live in English as The Plouffe Familyhttp://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/F/htmlF/familyplouff/familyplouff.htm on CBC Television the following year and ran on both networks until 1959. The series was revived in the 1980s as a miniseries. The series was based on the novel Les Plouffe, by Roger Lemelin. It chronicled the daily life of a working-class family in the years following World War II. The family included patriarch Th√©ophile, a former provincial cycling champion who had settled into life as a plumber, his wife Jos√©phine, a naive but kind-hearted mother who doted on her adult children Napol√©on, Ovide, C√©cile and Guillaume.

Poet Gabriela Mistral was born there in 1889. It shares borders to the west with the communes of La Higuera, La Serena and Andacollo, to the east with Argentina and to the south with Paihuano and Rio Hurtado. The commune is administered by the municipality of Vicu√±a, which is the principal city of the Valle de Elqui. History Vicu√±a was founded on February 22, 1821, by Colonel Joaqu√≠n Vicu√±a Larra√≠n, who was the first intendant of Coquimbo Province, by order of Bernardo O'Higgins. He named it Villa de San Isidro de Vicu√±a. In 1872, its name was shortened to Vicu√±a, in honor of its founder. Topography Bauer tower in the center of Vicu√±a. The Vicu√±a commune covers an area of , making it the largest commune in both the province and the Coquimbo Region, and the second-largest commune in the country. Vicu√±a occupies the major part of the mid and upper Elqui River basin, and the entire length of the Turbio river. The area is dominated by a mountainous backdrop, and extensive plains on the valley floor, where high-quality grapes for pisco are grown, along with other fruits and vegetables.

Economy Vicu√±a is a major center for pisco production. Cooperativa Agr√≠cola Pisquera Elqui Limitada (CAPEL) runs the main pisco distillery in the zone. Economic activity centers on the culture of grapes, fruits, cereals, and vegetables. Other industries include sheep ranching and iron and copper mining. Tourism has grown greatly in the last few years, primarily due to quality hotels and restaurants. The area around Vicu√±a experiences approximately 300 totally clear days and nights annually, and several large astronomical observatories are located nearby, including the touristic Mammalluca Observatory. The urban area is made up of buildings from around 1900. The city has a square of ancient trees, which displays sculptures that honor Gabriela Mistral, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other points of interest include the Temple of the Immaculate Conception; the Bauer Tower, which houses the office of tourism; and the Gabriela Mistral museums. =Tourism= Mamalluca observatory. A few kilometres outside town is the Route of the Grappa, visiting the factories known as pisqueras: Ruta Norte, Capel, Mistral, Tres Erres and Artesanos de Cochiguaz. The Mammalluca Observatory located 9 km north of Vicu√±a, has tourist and education programs. At the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, daily tourist visits are offered.

However, due to deteriorating law and order situation on the western borders of Pakistan, the Pushtuns from FATA have also settled in and around Havelian causing Pashtu to be widely spoken throughout Havelian. Also, an influx of refugees from Afghanistan has brought the Afghan dialect of Persian and Dari to district Havelian. Transport Havelian's main public transport consist of auto rickshaws, modified Suzuki pickup vehicles, tongs, which can accommodate anywhere from 8 to 13 people at a time. Taxis and automobiles for hire are also available. Vans and buses are frequently used for connecting Havelian to the surrounding cities and towns in the region. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif performed a groundbreaking ceremony of the Hazara Motorway, the road link of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, on November 29, 2014. The 60-kilometre-long, 4-lane fence opd expressway will cost Rs33 billion. The Hazara Motorway will reduce the drive time from Islamabad to Havelian to just 30 minutes, additionally providing a road to the Havelian Dry Port project. The project anticipates hundreds of thousands of employment opportunities, possibilities of new business ideas, and a socio-economic uplift of the whole region.

The Vernon Touch: The Writings of Dai Vernon in Genii, The Conjurors' Magazine from 1968 to 1990. Washington, DC: The Genii Corporation, 2006.) (June 11, 1894 - August 21, 1992), a.k.a. The Professor, was a Canadian magician. His expert sleight of hand technique and extensive knowledge, particularly with card tricks and close-up magic, garnered him respect among fellow magicians. His influence was considerable in the magic world of the 20th Century, and he was a mentor to numerous famous magicians. He lived out his last years at the Magic Castle, a nightclub in Hollywood, California. Biography Vernon was born in Ottawa as David Frederick Wingfield Verner. While performing, he often mentioned that he had learned his first trick from his father at age seven, adding wryly that he had \\"wasted the first 6 years\\" of his life. His father was a government worker and an amateur magician. Vernon studied mechanical engineering at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, but by World War I he had moved to New York City. Vernon first fell in love with magic when he was seven years old after his father took him to see a magic show. The first real magic book he ever owned was an early edition of perhaps the most famous card book of them all, The Expert at the Card Table, by S. W. Erdnase. By the time he was 13 he had memorized the contents of the book. He also had a famous encounter with another up-and-coming young magician from his town, Cliff Green, who asked Vernon, \\"What kind of magic do you do?\\" Vernon responded by asking the boy to name a card. Upon pulling a pack of cards from his pocket, Vernon turned over the top card of the deck to reveal the named card and replied to the speechless Green \\"That's the kind of magic I do. What kind of magic do you do?\\" As a young man, Vernon moved to New York where, in the back room of Clyde Powers' magic shop, he found favor among many of the great magicians of the era, including Dr. James William Elliott, Nate Leipzig, and Harry Kellar. He began to use the first name \\"Dai\\" after a newspaper used the name in place of \\"David\\"; the paper actually was using the Welsh nickname for David. When Verner first moved to the United States, the male member of a popular ice-skating pair had the surname Vernon; Americans continually mistook Verner's last name to be the same as the popular ice skater, and eventually the magician became fed up with correcting people and simply adopted \\"Vernon\\" as well. Owing to his extraordinary knowledge of, and skill at, sleight of hand, Vernon has long been affectionately known as The Professor. Harry Houdini (who in his early years billed himself as \\"The King of Kards\\") often boasted that if he saw a card trick performed three times in a row he would be able to figure it out. Vernon then showed Houdini a trick where he removed the top card of the deck and placed it second from the top, then turned over the top card to again reveal the original card. Houdini watched Vernon do the trick seven times (some versions of the story say five times), each time insisting that Vernon \\"do it again.\\" Finally, Houdini's wife and Vernon's friends said, \\"Face it, Houdini, you're fooled.\\" For years afterward, Vernon used the title The Man Who Fooled Houdini in his advertisements. Though respected by professional magicians nationwide due in part to publicity via the magazine The Sphinx, Vernon was essentially a gifted amateur until his 40s. Before the Magic Castle, Vernon never held a steady full-time job for more than a few months. He occasionally performed magic at nightclubs or on cruise ships to South America and back, and also toured the Philippines as an entertainer during WW2 with the United Service Organizations. His engineering degree was put to use as a sometime blueprint reader. However, Vernon's main source of income was cutting custom silhouette portraits, a talent that paid 25 to 50 cents per silhouette for about two minutes work during the 1920s and '30s.Johnson, 2005 A few hours a week cutting silhouettes was generally enough to support his family and finance his sleight of hand hobby (compare his silhouette fee with the first US minimum wage of 25 cents per hour in 1938). Vernon spent most of his early life traveling all over the United States of America looking for card cheats, and anyone who might know anything about sleight-of-hand with cards. He was famously under-credited for much of the work published in Jean Hugard and Frederick Braue's Expert Card Technique, though a later edition included an extra chapter which acknowledges Vernon's contributions. In fact, a huge portion of the sleight-of-hand had been discovered by Vernon over years of searching. Among magicians, he is credited with inventing or improving many standard close-up effects with cards, coins, and other small items. The \\"standard\\" Cups and balls routine is his, and his 6-ring \\"Symphony of the Rings\\" remains one of the most popular Chinese linking rings routines in use to this day. Vernon spent the last thirty years of his life as Magician-in-Residence and star attraction at The Magic Castle in Los Angeles, California. There he mentored numerous well-known magicians including Ricky Jay, Persi Diaconis, Doug Henning, Larry Jennings, Bruce Cervon, Michael Ammar, John Carney and Richard Turner. Family In 1924, Vernon married Eugenie \\"Jeanne\\" Hayes, a diminutive magician's assistant. They would have two sons, Theodore and Derek. Jeanne eventually tired of Dai's wanderlust, spendthrift money habits, and obsession with card tricks, and the couple lived separately by the 1950s, though they never formally divorced. Death Dai Vernon died on August 21, 1992, in Ramona, County of San Diego, California. His body was cremated and the ashes were interred on a shelf, with magic memorabilia at the Magic Castle. The Findagrave website states that his cremains were returned to his family after the Magic Castle was renovated.

The Moken (also Mawken or Morgan; ; ) are an Austronesian people of the Mergui Archipelago, a group of approximately 800 islands claimed by both Burma and Thailand. Most of the 2,000 to 3,000 Moken live a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle heavily based on the sea, though this is increasingly under threat. The Moken identify in a common culture, there are 1500 men and 1500 women and speak the Moken language, a distinct Austronesian language. Attempts by both Burma and Thailand to assimilate the Moken into the wider regional culture have met with very limited success. However, the Moken face an uncertain future as their population decreases and their nomadic lifestyle and unsettled legal status leave them marginalized by modern property and immigration laws, maritime conservation and development programs, and tightening border policies.Some classifications do not include Moken under the Malayan languages, or even under the Aboriginal Malay group of languages. \\"Ethnologue report for Moken/Moklen\\" Ethnologue. Moken is considered part of, but isolated within, the (Nuclear) Malayo-Polynesian family, displaying no particular affinities to any other (Nuclear) Malayo-Polynesian language. Moreover, it has undergone strong areal influence from neighbouring Mon‚ÄìKhmer languages, comparable to, but apparently independently from the Chamic languages. Nomenclature The people refer to themselves as Moken. The name is used for all of the Austronesian speaking tribes who inhabit the coast and islands in the Andaman Sea on the west coast of Thailand, the provinces of Satun, Trang, Krabi, Phuket, Phang Nga, and Ranong, up through the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar. The group includes the Moken proper, the Moklen (Moklem), the Orang Sireh (Betel-leaf People), and the Orang Lanta. The last, the Orang Lanta, are a hybridized group formed when the Malay people settled the Lanta islands where the proto-Malay Orang Sireh had been living. The Moklen are considered to be mostly sedentary with more permanent villages in the provinces of Phang- nga, Phuket, Krabi, and Satun. These individuals also have closer ties to the countries in which they reside as they accept both the nationality and citizenship. Their children are also educated through local schools and are exposed to more mainstream cultural ideas. The Moken residing on the Islands of Surin retain their more traditional methods and lifestyle. The Burmese call the Moken \\"selung\\", \\"salone\\", or \\"chalome\\".Anderson, John (1890). The Selungs of the Mergui Archipelago. London: Tr√ºbner & Co. pp. 1‚Äì5. In Thailand they are called \\"chao le,\\" which can mean people who ‚Äúlive by the sea and pursue a marine livelihood‚Äù or those who speak the Austronesian language. Another term that can be used is or \\"chao nam\\" (\\"people of the water\\"), although these terms are also used loosely to include the Urak Lawoi and even the Orang Laut. In Thailand, acculturated Moken are called \\"Thai mai\\" (\\"new Thais\\"). The Moken are also called sea gypsies, a generic term that applies to a number of peoples in Southeast Asia. The Urak Lawoi are sometimes classified with the Moken, but they are linguistically and ethnologically distinct, being much more closely related to the Malay people. Way of Life A Moken boat Their knowledge of the sea enables them to live off its fauna and flora by using simple tools such as nets and spears to forage for food, which allows them to impact the environment more minimally than other more intensive forms of subsistence. Furthermore, their frequent movement in kin groups of between two and ten families also allows the land to rest and prevents overuse. Moken are considered hunter-gatherers due to their nomadic lifestyle and lack of material good accumulation. They also believe strongly in the idea that natural resources cannot be owned individually but are rather something that the entire community has access to without restrictions. Their egalitarian society follows into their ancestral worship as they regularly present supernatural beings with food offerings. More recently, they have reached out and begun trading some food (sea cucumbers and edible bird nests) as well as marine products like pearls for other necessities at local markets. Trading and epidemics (cholera and smallpox) also lead to their nomadic lifestyles in order to collect a variety of products to trade and to avoid the spread of deadly diseases. If an epidemic begins to spread, the infected members will remain at the location with a small amount of provisions, while healthy members will depart to a new location. The hope is that the provisions will allow the sick enough time to recuperate while not endangering the rest of the kin group with their sickness. The nomadic lifestyle can also reduce group conflict as affected parties may leave one kin group and enter another to give some distance and allow the feud to die down. After some time has passed and the arguing parties see each other once more, the intensity of the argument will have decreased leading to more amicable relationships. During the dry north-east monsoon season (when the sea is relatively calm), the Moken live on their boats called kabang, which serve not just as transportation, but also as a kitchen, bedroom, and living area. Previously the Moken used a Kabang koman, ‚Äúa dug-out boat equipped with a salacca gunwale [where] Salacca is a light wood with a long stem‚Äù. To construct the boat, the different pieces are fitted into each other with the natural resources the Moken can find on land. The boat‚Äôs usage was discontinued more than 40 years ago as the salt water eroded the wood within three to sixth months, therefore new techniques were devised to create more robust boats. The kabang last longer and one anthropologist, Jacques Ivanoff, suggests that the boat with its bifurcated bow and stern represent the human body. In monsoon season, which falls between the months of May and October, they set temporary camps on the mainland. During the monsoon season, they build additional boats and forage for food in the forest. Some of the Burmese Moken are still nomadic people who roam the sea most of their lives; however, much of their traditional life, which is built on the premise of life as outsiders, is under threat. Aside from ancestor worship, the Moken have no religion. Underwater Sight For most of the human population, underwater vision is very poor for two different reasons. Both the curved cornea and the internal lens of the human fail in an aqueous solution. Unfortunately, this accounts for two thirds of the optical power with air as the medium. In water this processing power is lost, meaning most are left with extremely blurry vision. Moken children, however, are able to see underwater while freediving in order to collect clams, sea cucumbers, and more. They have actually been found to see better underwater than European children as their ‚Äúspecial resolution [is] more than twice as good‚Äù. A Swedish scientist, Anna Gislen, theorized that this was due to constriction of their pupils and accommodation of their visual focus. Other than these abilities, the Moken children had regular corneal curvature meaning that their eyes had not evolved to be flatter like many fish nor had their eyes become myopic as their vision on land is still clear. She tested this theory on seventeen Moken children and eighteen European children through sessions involving testing of underwater vision. Gislen's experiment affirmed her hypothesis, and she further discovered that European children could train themselves to develop this same trait. After eleven training sessions over one month, these European children developed underwater visual acuity equal to the Moken children's. At the same time, Gislen also documented that the European children sustained temporary eye irritation (\\"red eyes\\") as a result of their underwater dives, unlike the Moken children. Gislen's work highlights that both environmental/behavioral conditioning and evolutionary adaptation are involved in the reported phenomenon of extraordinary aquatic vision in Moken children. Members of another \\"sea gypsy\\" group, the Sama-Bajau, appear to have a number of genetic adaptations to facilitate a lifestyle involving extensive freediving. Governmental control The Burmese and Thai governments have made attempts at assimilating the people into their own culture, but these efforts have met with limited success. Thai Moken have been permanently settled in villages located in the Surin Islands (Mu Ko Surin National Park), in Phuket Province, on the northwestern coast of Phuket Island, and on the nearby Phi Phi Islands of Krabi Province.Bauerlein, Monika (November 2005) \\"Sea change: they outsmarted the tsunami, but Thailand's sea gypsies could be swept away by an even greater force\\" Mother Jones 30(6): pp. 56‚Äì61; The Andaman Sea off the Tenasserim coast was the subject of keen scrutiny from Burma's regime during the 1990s due to offshore petroleum discoveries by multinational corporations including Unocal, Petronas and others. Reports from the late-1990s told of forced relocation by Burma's military regime of the sea gypsies to mainland sites. It was claimed most of the Salone had been relocated by 1997, which is consistent with a pervasive pattern of forced relocation of suspect ethnic, economic and political groups, conducted throughout Burma during the 1990s. In Thailand, the Moken have been the target of land grabs by developers contesting their ownership of ancestral lands. Although sea gypsies have resided in Thailand's Andaman coastal provinces for several centuries, they have historically neglected to register official ownership of the land due to their ignorance of legal protocol. History There is much speculation as to the historical origins of the Moken people. It is thought that, due to their Austronesian language, they originated in Southern China as agriculturalists 5000‚Äì6000 years ago. From there, the Austronesian peoples dispersed and settled various South Asian Islands. It is theorized that the Moken were forced off of these coastal islands into a nomadic lifestyle on the water due to rising sea levels. 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami The islands the Moken inhabit received much media attention in 2005 during the recovery from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. As they are keenly attuned to the ocean, the Moken in some areas knew the tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004 was coming and managed to preserve many lives. However, in the coastal villages of Phang Nga Province, like Tap Tawan, the Moken suffered severe devastation to housing and fishing boats in common with other Moken communities.

In aviation, aircraft ground handling defines the servicing of an aircraft while it is on the ground and (usually) parked at a terminal gate of an airport. Overview Icelandair plane being serviced by another airline; SAS at Gardermoen Airport A ground-handling tug pulls a British Airways Boeing 747-400 at London Heathrow Airport, England Airbus A380-800 operated by Qatar Airways at London Heathrow Airport apron outside Terminal 4 with a wide range of ground handling equipments around such as aircraft container, pallet loader, ULD, jet air starter, belt loader, pushback tug, catering vehicles and dollies. Many airlines subcontract ground handling to airports, handling agents or even to another airline. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), conservative estimates indicate airlines outsource more than 50 per cent of the ground handling that takes place at the world's airports. Ground handling addresses the many service requirements of an airliner between the time it arrives at a terminal gate and the time it departs on its next flight. Speed, efficiency, and accuracy are important in ground handling services in order to minimize the turnaround time (the time during which the aircraft must remain parked at the gate). Faster turnarounds for lower ground times are correlated to better profits. Airlines with less- frequent service or fewer resources at a particular location sometimes subcontract ground handling or on-call aircraft maintenance to another airline, as it is a short-term cheaper alternative to setting up its own ground handling or maintenance capabilities. Airlines may participate in an industry-standard Mutual Assistance Ground Service Agreement (MAGSA). The MAGSA is published by the Air Transport Association (the current version is from 1981) and is used by airlines to assess prices for maintenance and support to aircraft at so-called MAGSA Rates, which are updated annually based on changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index. Airlines may choose to contract for ground handling services under the terms of a Standard Ground Handling Agreement (SGHA) published in the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Airport Handling Manual. Airlines may also contract for ground handling services under non-standard terms. Most ground services are not directly related to the actual flying of the aircraft, and instead involve other tasks. The major categories of ground handling services are described below. =Cabin service= The primary aim of this service offering is to ensure passenger comfort. While cabin cleaning comprises the bulk of the effort, it also includes tasks such as replenishing onboard consumables (soap, tissues, toilet paper, reading materials) and washable items like pillows and blankets. =Catering= Catering includes the unloading of unused food and drink from the aircraft, and the loading of fresh food and drink for passengers and crew. Airline meals are typically delivered in Airline service trolleys. Empty or trash-filled trolley from the previous flight are replaced with fresh ones. Meals are prepared mostly on the ground in order to minimize the amount of preparation (apart from chilling or reheating) required in the air. While some airlines provide their own catering, others have either owned catering companies in the past and divested themselves of the companies, or have outsourced their catering to third-party companies.

A boutique hotel is a small hotel which typically has between 10 and 100 rooms in settings with upscale accommodations and individualized unique selling points (USPs). History Boutique hotels began appearing in the 1980s in major cities like London, New York, and San Francisco. Boutique hotels are believed to have been introduced in the early 1980s. Two of the first boutique hotels in the world opened their doors to the public in 1981: The Blakes Hotel in South Kensington, London (designed by celebrity stylist Anouska Hempel) and the Bedford in Union Square, San Francisco (the first in a series of 34 boutique hotels currently operated under the flag of one of the most eminent players in the boutique hotel world today, the Kimpton Group). Although there is some quibbling as to whether it was the first boutique hotel ever, Morgans, founded by Ian Shrager and Steve Rubell in New York City, is the most notable of the era; it debuted in 1984. San Francisco & Los Angeles Boutique Hoteliers were engaged in what was an East Coast/West Coast debate over exactly who coined the phrase. Many have laid claim. A trend observed in recent times is for international hotel chains to establish luxury boutique sub-brands to capitalize on the growth of this segment. Description Many boutique hotels are furnished in a themed, stylish and/or aspirational manner. The popularity of the boutique concept has prompted some multi-national hotel companies to try to capture a market share. In the United States, New York City remains an important centre for boutique hotels clustered about Manhattan. Some members of the hospitality industry are following the general \\"no-frill chic\\" consumer trend, with affordable or budget boutique hotels being created all around the world. Boutique hotels are found in London, New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles. They are also found in resort destinations with exotic amenities such as electronics, spas, yoga and painting classes.

He developed and sustained the company with his organizing ability and fundraising for more than four decades, serving as the company's general director from 1946 to 1989. According to the New York Times, he was \\"an expert in many fields,\\" organizing art exhibits and lecture tours in the same years. Early life Kirstein was born in Rochester, New York to Jewish parents, the son of Rose Stein and Louis E. Kirstein (1867‚Äì1942).\\"Lincoln Kirstein\\", New york Public Library His brother was George Kirstein, his sister was Mina Kirstein and his paternal grandparents were Jeanette (n√©e Leiter) and Edward Kirstein, a successful Rochester clothing manufacturer who ran E. Kirstein and Sons, Company. He grew up in a wealthy, Jewish, Bostonian family and attended the private Berkshire School, along with George Platt Lynes, graduating in 1926. He then attended Harvard, the alma mater of his father, vice-president of Filene's Department Store, graduating in 1930. His maternal grandfather was Nathan Stein, a senior executive at the Stein-Bloch & Co., in Rochester. CareerEarly career= In 1927, while an undergraduate at Harvard, Kirstein was frustrated that the literary magazine The Harvard Advocate would not invite him to join its editorial board despite his having published several well-regarded pieces in the magazine. With friend Varian Fry (who met his wife Eileen through Lincoln's sister Mina), he convinced his father to finance the Hound & Horn, a new literary quarterly. After graduation, he moved to New York in 1930, taking the quarterly with him. The publication gained prominence in the artistic world and ran until 1934 when Kirstein decided to focus his energy and resources on the career of George Balanchine and the development of the School of American BalletDuberman, p. 215. His interest in ballet and Balanchine started when he saw Balanchine's Apollo performed by the Ballets Russes. Kirstein became determined to bring Balanchine to the United States. In October 1933, together with Edward Warburg, a classmate from Harvard, and Vladimir Dimitriew, Balanchine's manager, they started the School of American Ballet in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1934, the studio moved to the fourth floor of a building at Madison Avenue and 59th Street in New York City. Warburg's father, Felix M. Warburg, invited the group of students from the evening class to perform at a private party. The ballet they performed was Serenade, the first major ballet choreographed by Balanchine in the United States. Just months later, Kirstein and Warburg founded, together with Balanchine and Dimitriew, the American Ballet, which later became the resident company of the Metropolitan Opera. According to Kirstein, this arrangement was unsatisfactory because the opera company failed to provide the ballet company with financial resources and artistic freedom.Kirstein, Lincoln. Blast at Ballet: A Corrective for American Audiences [1938], in Kirstein, Ballet: Bias and Belief: Three Pamphlets Collected and Other Dance Writings (New York: Dance Horizons, 1983), pp. 185-191. =World War II and Monuments Men= Kirstein's theatrical career was interrupted by the United States' entry into World War II. He enlisted in 1943, and before going overseas, he started working on a project gathering and documenting soldier art. He eventually developed this as the exhibit and book Artists Under Fire. In the spring of 1944, Kirstein traveled to London for the U.S. Arts and Monuments Commission, and after a month, he was transferred to the unit in France that came to be known as the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA). The section was devoted to rescuing and preserving European art.Monuments Men Foundation: Kuhn, Monuments Men> Kirstein, Pfc. Lincoln E. In January 1945, Kirstein was promoted to private first class in Patton's Third Army, and his unit moved to Germany. Kirstein was involved with retrieving artworks around Munich and from the salt mines at Altaussee. His article \\"The Quest for the Golden Lamb\\" about the quest was published in Town & Country in September 1945, the same month he was discharged from the army. =Ballet= In 1946, Balanchine and Kirstein founded the Ballet Society, which was renamed the New York City Ballet in 1948. In a letter that year, Kirstein stated, \\"The only justification I have is to enable Balanchine to do exactly what he wants to do in the way he wants to do it.\\"Alastair Macaulay, \\"A Paragon of the Arts, as Both Man and Titan\\" (review of Martin Duberman, The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein), Books of the Times, New York Times, 4 May 2007, accessed 5 January 2015 Kirstein served as the company's general director from 1946 until 1989. In a 1959 monograph titled What Ballet Is All About Kirstein wrote: \\"Our Western ballet is a clear if complex blending of human anatomy, solid geometry and acrobatics offered as a symbolic demonstration of manners‚Äîthe morality of consideration for one human being moving in time with another.\\" In 1976 poet Vernon Scannell said that Kirstein \\"regarded dancers not as artists but as acrobats; their skills were, he maintained, entirely physical and he felt his involvement with the dance was a salutary escape from the cerebral and sedentary life into a world that was closer to that of the athlete than the artist.\\"Scannell, Vernon. A Proper Gentleman, Robson Books, London: 1977 Kirstein's and Balanchine's collaboration lasted until the latter's death in 1983. Personal life Beginning in 1919, Kirstein kept a diary, continuing with the practice until the late 1930s. In writing a 2007 biography of Kirstein, The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein, Martin Duberman drew on these diaries, as well as Kirstein's numerous letters, to gain insight to Kirstein's personal life. Kirstein wrote about enjoying sex with various men, including Harvard undergraduates, sailors, street boys, and casual encounters in the showers at the 63rd Street YMCA. He had longer affairs with dancer Pete Martinez, artist Dan Maloney, and conservator Alexander Jensen Yow. Kirstein had both platonic relationships and many that started as casual sex and developed into long-term friendships. Lincoln Kirstein House, East 19th Street He also maintained relationships with women. In 1941, he married Fidelma Cadmus, a painter and the sister of the artist Paul Cadmus. Kirstein and his wife enjoyed an amicable if sometimes stressful relationship until her death in 1991, but she withdrew from painting and then from life, suffering breakdowns that eventually were more permanent than his. Some of his boyfriends lived with them in their East 19th Street house; \\"Fidelma was enormously fond of most of them.\\" The New York art world considered Kirstein's bisexuality an \\"open secret,\\" although he did not publicly acknowledge his sexual orientation until 1982. Kirstein's eclectic interests, ambition and keen interest in high culture, funded by independent means, drew a large circle of creative friends from many fields of the arts. These included Glenway Wescott, George Platt Lynes, Jared French, Bernard Perlin, Pavel Tchelitchev, Katherine Anne Porter, Barbara Harrison, Gertrude Stein, Donald Windham, Cecil Beaton, Jean Cocteau, W.H. Auden, George Tooker, Margaret French Cresson, Walker Evans, Sergei Eisenstein, Rexford Harrower and others. In his later years, Kirstein struggled with bipolar disorder - mania, depression, and paranoia. He destroyed the studio of friend Dan Maloney. He sometimes had to be constrained in a straitjacket for weeks at a psychiatric hospital. His illness did not generally affect his professional creativity until the end of his life. He also suffered two heart attacks in February 1975. =Legacy= English critic Clement Crisp wrote: \\"He was one of those rare talents who touch the entire artistic life of their time. Ballet, film, literature, theatre, painting, sculpture, photography all occupied his attention.\\" Kirstein helped organize a 1959 American tour for musicians and dancers from the Japanese Imperial Household Agency. At that time, Japanese Imperial court music, gagaku, had only rarely been performed outside the Imperial Music Pavilion in Tokyo at some of the great Japanese shrines. Kirstein commissioned and helped to fund the physical home of the New York City Ballet: the New York State Theater building at Lincoln Center, designed in 1964 by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee. Despite its conservative modernist exterior, the glittery red and gold interior recalls the imaginative and lavish backdrops of the Ballets Russes. He served as the general director of the ballet company from 1948 to 1989. Kirstein was among the public figures at the core of the effort to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church, before it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and subsequently became a New York State Historic Site. On March 26, 1984, President Ronald Reagan presented Kirstein with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his contributions to the arts. Kirstein was also a serious collector. Soon after the opening at Lincoln Center of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, he contributed a significant amount of historic dance materials to the Jerome Robbins Dance Division. Before his death in 1996, Kirstein also donated his personal papers, artworks, and other materials related to the history of dance and his life in the arts to the division. Kirstein was also the primary patron of the artist Paul Cadmus, Fidelma's brother, buying many of his paintings and subsidizing his living expenses. Cadmus had difficulty selling his work through galleries because of the erotically charged depictions of working class and middle class men, which provoked controversy. =Honors= * Presidential Medal of Freedom, U.S. * Handel Medallion, NYC highest cultural award. * Brandeis University Notable Achievement Award. * National Medal of Arts, U.S., 1985. * Royal Society of Arts, Benjamin Franklin Medal, UK, 1981. * National Society of Arts and Letters, National Gold Medal of Merit Award, U.S. * National Museum of Dance Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame inductee, 1987.

It was announced on 14 February 2005, and was released the next month. The 6680 was Nokia's first device with a front camera, and was specifically marketed for video calling. It was also Nokia's first with a camera flash. It went on sale retailing for 500 euros.http://my-symbian.com/main/index.php?m=200502 It was the spring-board onto the Nseries in April that year; its successor being the N70. Features The device features Bluetooth, a 1.3-megapixel fixed-focus camera, front VGA (0.3-megapixel) video call camera, hot swappable Dual Voltage Reduced Size MMC (DV-RS-MMC) memory expansion card support, stereo audio playback and a 2.1\\", 176x208, 18-bit (262,144) color display with automatic brightness control based on the environment. The 6680 remains a high-end 3G device. It is a smartphone offering office and personal management facilities, including Microsoft Office compatible software. The phone initially offered an innovative active standby mode, but this was removed by some network operators (for example, Orange) under their own adapted firmware. The phone, however, has been marred by a more-than-normal number of bugs, which have included crashes and security issues. The phone was also criticised in some reviews for the relatively limited memory available. In addition to the standard RS-MMC card, the 6680 can also use Dual Voltage Reduced Size MMC (DV-RS-MMC) cards which are also marketed as MMCmobile. While these cards have the same form factor as RS-MMC, the DV-RS-MMC have a 2nd row of connectors on the bottom. Make sure any upgraded card supports or claims to support 1.8V in addition to 3.0V. The phone operates on GSM 900/1800/1900, and UMTS 2100 on 3G networks. During its development, the 6680 was codenamed Milla. This handset was similar to its predecessor, the Nokia 6630. Key changes were the new \\"active standby\\" feature, the facility for face-to-face video calls, a camera flash, better screen and improved styling. The hardware application platform of this device is OMAP 1710. Variants Nokia 6681/6682 The Nokia 6681 and Nokia 6682 are GSM handsets by Nokia, running the Series 60 user interface on the Symbian operating system. The phones are GSM-only versions of the Nokia 6680. The only difference between the 6681 and the 6682 is the fact that the 6681 is targeted at the European market, being a GSM 900/1800/1900 tri-band handset, while the 6682 is targeted at the American one, supporting 850/1800/1900 frequencies.

It is located at about 15 km from the city of Bra»ôov and about the same distance from Bran, on the road that links Wallachia and Transylvania. History The Roman fort of Cumidava was discovered in 1856 near the town. The castle of R√¢»ônov was built in the years 1211-1225 by Teutonic Knights. R√¢»ônov was mentioned for the first time in 1331 as Rosnou and again in 1388 as villa Rosarum.http://www.siebenbuerger.de/ortschaften/rosenau/informationen/ While the village was razed many times in its history by Tatars, Turks and Wallachians, the castle was conquered only once, in 1612 by Gabriel B√°thory. In 2002, the R√¢»ônov Fortress and surroundings were used during the shooting of several scenes from the American film Cold Mountain. Myth There is a myth attached to R√¢»ônov Citadel. During a particularly long siege of the fortress, the citizens of R√¢»ônov were concerned about the lack of available fresh drinking water. Two Turkish soldiers, having been captured earlier, were put to the task of digging a well in the centre of the fortress. These two men were assured that they would be given their freedom once the well was completed. According to local legend, it took them 17 years to finish the well, but they were still killed afterwards. This famous well still sits in the centre of R√¢»ônov Fortress, and is 143 metres deep. Culture As of August 2013, R√¢»ônov became the host of the first extreme metal festival in Romania, known as Rockstadt Extreme Fest which was held at the hill's base with the R√¢»ônov Citadel. The festival featured bands such as Decapitated, Napalm Death, Gojira, Carach Angren, Septicflesh, Primordial among many others and it continues to this day. Sports R√¢»ônov Sports Complex was built just outside the town in CƒÉrbunarii Valley, for 2013 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival which was hosted in the nearby city of Bra»ôov. Two ski jumping events took place in R√¢»ônov, as part of the Women's Ski Jumping World Cup 2013/2014 competition. The events were scheduled for March 2014, on the \\"Valea CƒÉrbunƒÉrii\\" slope.

He began practising magic in 1946, as a teenager. He studied physics and mathematics at Cambridge University; whilst there he was also secretary of the Pentacle Club. He was a patent agent, and later a computer expert, in his day job. Otherwise, he was an amateur card and close-up magician. He was awarded an Academy of Magical Arts Creative Fellowship in 1972. He created a number of well-known magic tricks, including The Four Card Trick, Between Your Palms, Point Of Departure and Diamond Cut Diamond. In 1975 he briefly toured the US giving a highly praised lecture known as the \\"Dazzle Card Act\\", which consisted of a magic act followed by a detailed discussion of routining. Notes on the lecture were released under the title Cardwork. Elmsley was the subject of The Collected Works of Alex Elmsley (vol. 1 1991, vol. 2 1994).

He is the co-lead guitarist for the rock band Def Leppard, joining the band in 1982 during the recording of the Pyromania album.35 Years Ago: Def Leppard Replaces Pete Willis With Phil Collen at Ultimate Classic Rock; by Martin Kielty; July 2017 Early years Philip Kenneth Collen was born in Hackney, London, England. Collen got his first guitar, a red Gibson SG, on his 16th birthday, and taught himself how to play.10 questions: Phil Collen at Music Radar; 12 September 2014 He played with several bands including Lucy, Tush, and Dumb Blondes. He left school to work in a factory as a motorcycle dispatch rider until his band Girl got their first record contract. During his tenure with Girl, Collen's career began rising, spurred by the relative success of the albums Sheer Greed and Wasted Youth, which allowed Collen the opportunity to play at more significant venues.Phil Collen NNDB. 2009. Retrieved 11 January 2010. A young Phil Collen can also be seen on the back cover of Deep Purple's live album Made in Japan as the live photo was actually taken at the Rainbow theatre in London, a concert Collen attended, and not in Japan. In a recent interview, Collen revealed that he was approached by Steve Harris to join Iron Maiden replacing guitarist Dennis Stratton. Def Leppard Before Collen's entrance into Def Leppard on 12 July 1982 during the recording of Pyromania, he had previously been asked to consider joining the band during the 1981 tour for High 'n' Dry by Joe Elliott and Steve Clark, whom he knew at the time. Despite this invitation, there was no need to replace Pete Willis yet and as a result, Collen stayed as a member of Girl for the time being. =Recruitment and friendship with Steve Clark= After Willis was fired due to alcohol problems, Joe Elliott called and asked Collen to audition. He was asked to perform solos on the songs \\"Stagefright\\" and \\"Photograph\\" during the recording sessions of Pyromania. Mutt Lange, the band's producer, said to Phil \\"just have fun on it, play some solos on it\\". \\"Photograph\\", \\"Rock of Ages\\", \\"Foolin'\\", \\"Stagefright\\", and \\"Rock Till You Drop\\" were all songs that he played solos on. His solo on \\"Stagefright\\" was the first take of anything on the albumPhil Collen Recommends... at Music Aficionado; retrieved 2019 He and fellow guitarist Clark quickly bonded, becoming close friends and leading to the trademark dual-guitar sound of Def Leppard. Collen and Clark became known as the \\"Terror Twins,\\" in recognition of their talents. By this time, Collen had also become noted for his trademark bare-chested stage appearances. =Changes in lifestyle, death of Clark and Adrenalize sessions= During the 1980s, Collen quit drinking alcohol, which had developed into a serious addiction, stopped eating meat and adopted a generally healthy lifestyle. According to Collen, he began suffering from blackouts due to alcohol and quit when he realized that he was losing control of his addiction, which was starting to dominate his life. In contrast, Clark did not follow such standards and died due to alcohol abuse in early 1991. After Clark died, Collen was faced with the challenge of not only dealing with the loss of a friend and bandmate but also with the burden and responsibility of the Adrenalize recordings. The music had already been written but Clark's playing style differed so much from Collen's that recording Clark's parts proved very difficult. While Clark's playing style was rhythmic, melodic and sometimes even characterized as \\"sloppy,\\" Collen's style was technical and precise, leading to difficulties in mimicking the sound of Clark's playing style. Due to the aftermath of Clark's death, as well as the issues with the recording of Adrenalize, Collen seriously considered leaving Def Leppard. According to Joe Elliott, Collen didn't want to continue in the band anymore with Steve not being there. He said, \\"I'd rather be a plumber.\\" Clark would ultimately be replaced as the band's co-lead guitarist by Vivian Campbell, formerly of Dio and Whitesnake, shortly before the Adrenalize tour. This relieved Collen of some of the pressures of the \\"overkill\\" production style of Def Leppard, as well as the challenge of reproducing Clark's guitar parts for live shows. Equipment In 1989, Collen worked with Jackson Guitars to develop an ergonomically correct electric guitar, although according to Collen, he designed them because \\"they looked cool,\\" and they ended up having bad balance, as well as a \\"really weird shape.\\" Recently, his live rig with Def Leppard consists of various Jackson PC1 guitars, some are modified, all equipped with Dimarzio pickups, Floyd Rose Tremolo Units and Sustainers. For acoustics, Collen uses several Fenders acoustics. For strings, Collen uses D'Addario 0.13 ‚Äì 0.54 and 0.13 ‚Äì 0.56 gauge strings. Side projects Collen performing in 2018. Collen has been involved in several side projects over his career, most notably the band Man Raze, formed as a joint collaboration with former Girl bandmate Simon Laffy as bassist and drummer Paul Cook from the Sex Pistols. Collen played lead guitar on Donny Osmond's song Just Between You and Me in 1990. Due to his band disapproving of him playing on this song, he was credited as Rory James Collen on the track. In 1990, Collen co-produced the On the Edge album of the Australian band BB Steal. In 1991, Collen offered a song he had written, \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" to the band The Law, which was featured on the band's self-titled album. This album was the band's only release. \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" was later recorded and released by Def Leppard. In 1993, Collen executive produced the album Sublime to the Ridiculous for the band, Sheer Greed, composed of former members of Girl, an act Collen was also associated earlier in his career. Collen has also worked in side projects with Def Leppard singer Joe Elliott. One of these recent projects was a tribute to David Bowie and Mick Ronson. He and Elliott also joined with Trevor Bolder and Mick \\"Woody\\" Woodmansey from Spiders from Mars and keyboardist Dick Decent to form the band Cybernauts. In 2001 they released a live album of Bowie songs. In 1996, Collen performed as a featured guitarist on the Jeffology: A Guitar Chronicle album ‚Äì a tribute album to Jeff Beck. Collen performed on the single, \\"'Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" from the album. In 2010, Collen recorded the song \\"Hard Times Celebrate\\" with rapper Bazaar Royale, featured on the album \\"The Ride.\\" Phil Collen formed a blues project by the name of Delta Deep with vocalist Debbi Blackwell Cook of the 80's group The Jammers, which released an eponymous debut in 2015. In 2017, Collen was featured on three tracks of the reunited The Professionals album \\"What in the World.\\" Collen joined Joe Satriani and John Petrucci on the 2018 edition of the G3 Tour in the United States. Personal life Collen has lived in the US for 25 years and currently resides in Orange County, Southern California. He commented, \\"I'm almost a California native now.\\" He has five children: Rory (born 1990), Samantha (born 2004), Savannah (born 2009), Charlotte (born 2014) and Jaxson (born 2018). He was married to Jacqueline Collen-Tarolly (1989) and Anita Thomas-Collen (1999). He married actress costume designer Helen L. Simmons in 2010. Collen is a vegan and has been a vegetarian for 35 years. Collen is also colorblind. Collen has been training extensively in martial arts for over 20 years. He began his martial arts training in Kempo Karate, earning a black belt. He also has studied kickboxing with Benny Urquidez and Muay Thai with Jean Carillo.

He is a professor of Holocaust Studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Biography As a native citizen of Prague, Czechoslovakia, Bauer was fluent in Czech, Slovak and German at an early age, and later learned Hebrew, Yiddish, English, French and Polish. His father had strong Zionist convictions and during the 1930s he tried to raise money to relocate his family to the British Mandate of Palestine. On the day Nazi Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, March 15, 1939, the family migrated to Palestine by managing to get past Nazi officials on a train which slipped them over the border into Poland, from which they moved, via Romania, to Palestine.Dalia Karpel 'History professor Yehuda Bauer: 'Netanyahu doesn't know history' at Haaretz 21 February 2013. Bauer attended high school in Haifa and at sixteen, inspired by his history teacher, Rachel Krulik, he decided to dedicate himself to studying history. Upon completing high school, he joined the Palmach. He attended Cardiff University in Wales on a British scholarship, interrupting his studies to fight in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, after which he completed his degree. Bauer returned to Israel to join Kibbutz Shoval and began his graduate work in history at the Hebrew University. He received his doctorate in 1960 for a thesis on the British Mandate of Palestine. The following year, he began teaching at the Institute for Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University. He served on the central committee of Mapam, then the junior partner party of Israel's ruling Mapai (Israel Labour Party), and was a visiting professor at Brandeis University, Yale University, Richard Stockton College, and Clark University. He was the founding editor of the journal Holocaust and Genocide Studies, and served on the editorial board of the Encyclopaedia of the Holocaust, published by Yad Vashem in 1990.

ViewsHolocaust= Bauer specializes in the subjects of the Holocaust, antisemitism‚Äîa word which he insists should be written unhyphenated. Lecture by Yehuda Bauer, 2003. Jewish Studies at UC Santa Cruz‚Äîand the Jewish resistance movement during the Holocaust, and he has argued for a wider definition of the term. In Bauer's view, resistance to the Nazis comprised not only physical opposition, but any activity that gave the Jewish people dignity and humanity in the most humiliating and inhumane conditions. Furthermore, Bauer has disputed the popular view that most Jews went to their deaths passively‚Äî\\"like sheep to the slaughter\\".Bauer, Yehuda. Interview with Amos Goldberg. 18 January 1998. 22 July 2007 He argues that, given the conditions in which the Jews of Eastern Europe had to live under and endure, what is surprising is not how little resistance there was, but rather how much. Bauer is also known for defending Rudolf Kastner and the Aid and Rescue Committee, who have been criticized for allegedly not publicizing the Vrba-Wetzler report which documented the deportation of the Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. According to Bauer, conditions prevented Kastner and other Jewish leaders from publicizing what they knew, and they also prevented Jews from escaping.Bauer, Yehuda. Jews for Sale? Nazi‚ÄìJewish Negotiations 1933‚Äì1945. Yale University Press, 1994, p. 72.Vrba, Rudolf. I Escaped from Auschwitz, Barricade Books, 2002, p. 406. The initiation of the Holocaust With regard to the functionalism versus intentionalism question, Bauer started out as an Intentionalist, but he is now the leading proponent of a synthesis of the two schools. Bauer argues that on the basis of Heinrich Himmler's memorandum of May 25, 1940 to Adolf Hitler regarding the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\"‚Äîin which Himmler states his rejection of \\"the Bolshevik method of physical annihilation of a people out of inner conviction as un- German and impossible,\\" and goes on to recommend the Madagascar Plan as the desired \\"territorial solution\\" of the \\"Jewish Question\\"‚Äîproves that there was no master plan for genocide going back to the days when Hitler wrote Mein Kampf. However, Bauer takes issue with Functionalist historians, such as Hans Mommsen, who argue that the lead in the Holocaust was taken entirely by lower level officials with little involvement by the leadership in Berlin. Bauer believes that Hitler was the key figure who caused the Holocaust, and that at some point in the later half of 1941, he gave a series of orders which called for the genocide of the entire Jewish population. Bauer has pointed to the discovery of an entry in Himmler's notebook dated December 18, 1941 where Himmler wrote down the question \\"What to do with the Jews of Russia?\\" According to the same notebook, Hitler's response to the question was \\"Exterminate them as partisans.\\"Bauer, Yehuda Rethinking the Holocaust Yale University Press, 2000, page 5 In Bauer's view, this is as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust. Bauer believes that, at about the same time, Hitler gave further verbal orders for the Holocaust, but unfortunately for historians, nobody bothered to write them down. What the Nazis called the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" was formalized at the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942. The Holocaust was not just another genocide Bauer has often criticized what he considers to be deleterious trends in writing about the Holocaust. He has often taken exception to those who argue that the Holocaust was just another genocide. Though he agrees that there have been other genocides in history which have targeted groups other than Jews, he argues that the Holocaust was the worst single case of genocide in history, in which every member of a nation was selected for annihilation, and that it therefore holds a special place in human history. These views have caused clashes between Bauer and the American historian Henry Friedlander who argues that the Romani and the disabled were just as much victims of the Holocaust as the Jews were. However, Bauer has said that the Romani were subject to genocide (just not \\"the Holocaust\\") and he has supported the demands of Romani for reparations from Germany. The Holocaust as a mystical experience Another trend which Bauer has denounced is the representation of the Holocaust as a mystical experience outside the normal range of human understanding. He has argued against the work of some Orthodox rabbis and theologians who say that the Holocaust was the work of God and part of a mysterious master plan for the Jewish people. In Bauer's view, those who seek to promote this line of thinking argue that God is just and good, while simultaneously bringing down the Holocaust on the Jewish people. Bauer has argued that a God who inflicts the Shoah on his Chosen People is neither good nor just. Moreover, Bauer has argued that this line of reasoning robs Adolf Hitler of his evil: if Hitler was just fulfilling God's will regarding the Jews, then he was merely an instrument of divine wrath and did not choose to be evil. Criticizing Goldhagen's \\"eliminationist\\" antisemitism Bauer has criticized the work of the American political scientist Daniel Goldhagen, who writes that the Holocaust was the result of the allegedly unique \\"eliminationist\\" antisemitic culture of the Germans. He has accused Goldhagen of Germanophobic racism, and of only selecting evidence which is favorable to his thesis. For example, Bauer has written that, according to the 1931 German census, about 50,000 German Jews were living in mixed marriages with Christians, giving Germany one of the highest rates of mixed marriages in the world at the time. In Bauer's opinion, if the average German had been full of murderous \\"eliminationist\\" antisemitism, as Goldhagen argues, there would have been fewer mixed marriages. In turn Goldhagen has accused Bauer of not properly understanding his arguments and of being jealous of what Goldhagen considers his discovery of the \\"key\\" that explains the entire Holocaust. =Conquest of Canaan= In reference to the conquest of Canaan by the ancient Israelites, which resulted in the massacre of the Amalekites and Midianites, genocide historian Adam Jones has quoted Bauer: \\"As a Jew, I must live with the fact that the civilization I inherited ... encompasses the call for genocide in its canon.\\"Adam Jones References p. 4, note 6, citing Bauer, Rethinking the Holocaust, (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), p. 41 =Purim= Professor Bauer was a featured speaker at the 2013 Global Forum to Combat Antisemitism, now a major international event in Jerusalem organized by Israel's Foreign Ministry. He stated that many nations have myths similar to Purim. =Possibility of genocide in Palestine-Israel= While speaking to a group of visitors to Israel in 2003, Bauer stated that \\"What we have here between the Israelis and the Palestinians is an armed conflict - if one side becomes stronger there is a chance of genocide.\\" When one of the visitors asked, \\"Am I to understand that you think Israel could commit genocide on the Palestinian people?,\\" Bauer answered \\"Yes,\\" and added, \\"Just two days ago, extremist settlers passed out flyers to rid Arabs from this land. Ethnic cleansing results in mass killing.\\" Bauer also noted that opinion polls show that a high percentage of Palestinians want to get rid of Jews.Halpern, Orly, \\"Bauer: It could happen here,\\" Haaretz, 26 February 2003 =Could any Jews have been rescued by America?= In January 2012, Bauer's article in the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs entitled \\"The Holocaust, America and American Jewry\\" precipitated a bitter debate between him, Rafael Medoff (Wyman Institute) and Alexander J. Groth (University of California, Davis), on what the US Government and the Jews of America could and could not have done to rescue the Jews of Europe.. Holocaust Rescue Revisited, Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs VII:3, 127-142 At Yad Vashem Professor Bauer stated that Hillel Kook (Peter Bergson), founder and director of the New York based Emergency Committee for the Rescue of European Jewry (a.k.a. Bergson Group), did not save anyone. =Christian- Jewish relations= Concerning Pope Benedict XVI's pilgrimage to Israel and Jordan, Bauer argued that the Pope meant well and tried to walk the tightrope between Arab-Palestinian-Muslim and Palestinian-Christian enmity toward Israel and the Jews on the one hand, and the collective trauma of Jews in Israel and elsewhere regarding the Holocaust on the other.Yehuda Bauer, \\"The Pope Meant Well,\\" Jerusalem Post, May 13, 2009 Published worksAuthored books= * The initial organization of the Holocaust survivors in Bavaria, Jerusalem: Yad Vashem, 1970 * From diplomacy to Resistance: A history of Jewish Palestine.

Professional career Tony Sly joined No Use for a Name as lead guitarist in 1987. He later took on vocal duties full- time in 1989 when previous vocalist Chris Dodge left the band. Their first album Incognito was released in 1990 on the label New Red Archives and featured a heavy but melodic hardcore punk sound. The band's second album Don't Miss the Train was released in 1992 and featured a much more melodic hardcore sound. The band's third album ¬°Leche con Carne!, which was released in 1995, was their debut on the Fat Wreck Chords label, though they released an EP titled The Daily Grind on the label in 1993. The album marked a change of musical style going from hardcore punk more into punk rock and skate punk. Also in 1993, guitarist Robin Pfefer replaced Chris Dodge and took the position of the lead guitarist, allowing Tony Sly to focus on singing and playing rhythm guitar instead. In 2004, Tony Sly, along with Lagwagon front man Joey Cape released a split acoustic album. Acoustic was released on May 18, 2004, through Fat Wreck Chords and featured 12 tracks: acoustic renditions of No Use for a Name and Lagwagon songs performed by each respective member, along with two new exclusive tracks, one by each member. On July 10, 2007, No Use for a Name released a best of compilation, titled All the Best Songs. The compilation marked the band's 20th anniversary together and included 24 previously released remastered singles, plus two previously unreleased songs. Sly went on his first solo acoustic tour in March 2009. On February 16, 2010, 12 Song Program (produced by Jamie McMann), Tony Sly's first album as a solo acoustic artist was released through Fat Wreck Chords. On February 6, 2010, Sly started his solo tour in support of the album with a few North American dates, where he was joined by former No Use for a Name bandmate Chris Shiflett. On February 17, 2010, Sly started his first solo European tour, where he toured alongside Lagwagon's Joey Cape and Drag the River's Jon Snodgrass, until March 10, 2010. Tony Sly spent the rest of the spring touring in support of NOFX and Teenage Bottlerocket on their co-headline tour, then joining Joey Cape on a short Australian tour in the summer. Sly was due to record the next No Use for a Name album in late 2010, for a spring 2011 release. It would have been the first new album from the band since 2008's The Feel Good Record of the Year. These plans were pushed back when Sly decided to record a second solo album. In December 2010, Sly announced that he was in the studio recording songs for a Japanese split EP. On December 29, 2010, he commented that the Japanese split EP songs came out well, and that he was gathering material for a new full-length solo album. In January 2011, Sly finished writing for his next solo album. He entered the studio later that month to start recording. He described the album's sound as being \\"sad\\". By February 2011, Sly had recorded 17 songs for his album and decided to take a break from the studio to play some solo acoustic shows and road-test some new songs. In March 2011, Sly announced that he was going back to the studio with producer Jamie McMann. Between April 7‚Äì18, 2011 and May 31 ‚Äì June 6, he played two short Canadian tours in support of his second solo album.

Sad Bear was released on October 11, 2011, through Fat Wreck Chords. Sly's final solo show took place in Gainesville, Florida on July 29, 2012. His last show with No Use for a Name took place at the D-Tox Rockfest in Montebello, Quebec on June 15, 2012.  Death  On July 31, 2012, Sly was found dead in his sleep at age 41. The cause of Sly's death was not officially released. On September 8, 2012, when the surviving members of No Use for a Name played a show at the Envol et Macadam festival in Quebec City, Quebec in honor of Sly, bassist Matt Riddle confirmed that the band was splitting up. In November 2013, Fat Wreck Chords released The Songs of Tony Sly: A Tribute, a tribute album featuring artists doing their own takes on Tony Sly and No Use for a Name songs. Artists on this album include NOFX, The Bouncing Souls, Snuff, Joey Cape, Strung Out, Alkaline Trio, Simple Plan, Gaslight Anthem, Teenage Bottlerocket, Yellowcard, Mad Caddies, Rise Against, The Flatliners, Lagwagon, Bad Religion, and Pennywise.

White symbolizes silver and virtue; additionally, it is common in Tuva for hostesses to greet guests with silver streamers in their arms. The golden yellow triangle symbolizes gold and Buddhism. Blue symbolizes the morals of nomadic herdsmen (who are commonly respected in the region), as well the Tuvan sky. The blue pall symbolizes the confluence of the Bii-Khem (Bolshoy Yenisei) and Kaa-Khem (Maly Yenisei) rivers at the Tuvan capital of Qƒ±zƒ±l, where they form the Yenisei River, known to locals as the Ulug-Khem River.

Its primary hosts are humans, and it is one of the world's major \\"nuisance pests\\". Although bed bugs can be infected with at least 28 human pathogens, no studies have found that the insects are capable of transmitting any of these to humans. They have been found with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), but the significance of this is still unknown. Investigations into potential transmission of HIV, MRSA, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis E have not shown that bed bugs can spread these diseases. However, there is some evidence that arboviruses may be transmissible. Bed bug bites or cimicosis may lead to a range of skin manifestations from no visible effects to prominent blisters. Effects include skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.  Occurrence and Distribution  C. lectularius is found all over the world in almost every area that has been colonized by humans. In the past, bed bugs were particularly an affliction of the poor and occurred in mass shelters. However, in the early part of the modern resurgence it was the tourist areas that were impacted. Today, bed bugs have conquered quite diverse locations, ranging from hospitals, hotels to trains, cruise ships and even airplanes. Most commonly, bed bugs travel as stowaways in luggage, although they can be transferred via furnishing and other belongings, as well by spreading to adjoining properties. Since there are no mandatory reporting requirements, exact figures on the occurrence of bed bugs are unknown and, due to the stigma often associated, many infestations are simply not reported. Life cycle If feeding regularly, a female bed bug can lay between two and three eggs per day throughout her adult lifetime, which may last several months, allowing one female to produce hundreds of offspring under optimal conditions. The tiny (<1 mm) yellowish-white eggs are vase-shaped, and are laid within harborages where the insects rest between blood meals and spend virtually all of their time: although parasitic, they do not reside on their hosts and only contact them briefly for blood meals. Eggs typically hatch within 10 days at room temperature, but become non-viable below . Cimex lectularius goes through five immature life stages that each require a blood meal to develop and move on to the next stage. The life cycle occurs more rapidly at warmer temperatures, and more slowly at lower ones. Once the egg hatches, the larval form must take one blood meal per week as it completes each of its five to six molts. Once it completes the final molt, it will have reached the adult stage and can reproduce. Meals take several minutes to consume, and occur only under the correct conditions: darkness, warmth, and carbon dioxide. C. lectularius typically feed on hosts when they are asleep, they tend to feed exclusively on humans, and are obligate blood feeders. Newly hatched nymphs must consume a blood meal within two to three days or will die of starvation, whereas an adult can live for as long as six months between feedings.

It is the type genus of the tribe Zanthoxyleae in the subfamily Rutoideae. Several of the species have yellow heartwood, to which their generic name alludes. Description Plants in the genus Zanthoxylum are shrubs, trees or woody climbers armed with trichomes. The leaves are arranged alternately and are usually pinnate or trifoliate. The flowers are usually arranged in panicles and usually function as male or female flowers with four sepals and four petals, the sepals remaining attached to the fruit. Male flowers have four stamens opposite the sepals. Female flowers have up to five, more or less free carpels with the styles free or sometimes fused near the tip. The fruit is usually of up to four follicles fused at the base, each containing a single seed almost as large as the follicle. Taxonomy The genus Zanthoxylum was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the first volume of Species Plantarum. The generic name is derived from Ancient Greek words (xanthos), meaning \\"yellow,\\" and (xylon), meaning \\"wood.\\" It is technically misspelled, as the z should be x, but botanical nomenclature does not allow for spelling corrections. It refers to a yellow dye made from the roots of some species. The first species that Linnaeus described was Zanthoxylum trifoliatum, now regarded as a synonym of Eleutherococcus trifoliatus.

Zanthoxylum beecheyanum and Zanthoxylum piperitum are two species commonly grown as bonsai. =Culinary use= The fruit of several species is used to make the spice Sichuan pepper. They are also used as bonsai trees. Historically, the bark was used in traditional medicine.Wilbur, C. Keith, MD. Revolutionary Medicine 1700-1800. The Globe Pequot Press. Page 23. 1980. Spices are made from a number of species in this genus, especially Zanthoxylum piperitum, Z. simulans, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium Z. nitidum, Z. rhetsa, Z. alatum, and Z. acanthopodium. Sichuan pepper is most often made by grinding the husks that surround Z. piperitum berries. In the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa in Western India, the berries of Z. rhetsa are sun-dried and added to foods such as legumes and fish. Because the trees bear fruit during the monsoon season, the berries are associated with the concurrent Krishna Janmashtami festival. Chemistry Plants in the genus Zanthoxylum contain the lignan sesamin. Species identified in Nigeria contains several types of alkaloids including benzophenanthridines (nitidine, dihydronitidine, oxynitidine, fagaronine, dihydroavicine, chelerythrine, dihydrochelerythrine, methoxychelerythrine, norchelerythrine, oxychelerythrine, decarine and fagaridine), furoquinolines (dictamine, 8-methoxydictamine, skimmianine, 3-dimethylallyl-4-methoxy-2-quinolone), carbazoles (3-methoxycarbazole, glycozoline), aporphines (berberine, tembetarine, magnoflorine, M-methyl-corydine), canthinones (6-canthinone), acridones (1-hydroxy-3-methoxy-10-methylacridon-9-one, 1-hydroxy-10-methylacridon-9-one, zanthozolin), and aromatic and aliphatic amides.The Nigerian Zanthoxylum; Chemical and biological values. S. K. Adesina, Afr. J. Trad. CAM, 2005, volume 2, issue 3, pages 282-301 (article ) Hydroxy-alpha sanshool is a bioactive component of plants from the genus Zanthoxylum, including the Sichuan pepper.

It is the result of a gradual drop in testosterone; a steady decline in testosterone levels of about 1% per year can happen and is well documented in both men and women. Terminology Late-onset hypogonadism is an endocrine condition as well as a result of aging. The terms \\"male menopause\\" and \\"andropause\\" are used in the popular media and are misleading, as they imply a sudden change in hormone levels similar to what women experience in menopause. A decrease in libido in men as a result of age is sometimes colloquially referred to as penopause.Gooren, L. J. G. \\"The age‚Äêrelated decline of androgen levels in men: clinically significant?.\\" British journal of urology 78.5 (1996): 763-768. Symptoms, diagnosis, and screening As of 2016, the International Society for the Study of the Aging Male defines late-onset hypogonadism as a series of symptoms in older adults related to testosterone deficiency that combines features of both primary and secondary hypogonadism; the European Male Aging Study (a prospective study of ~3000 men) defined the condition by the presence of at least three sexual symptoms (e.g. reduced libido, reduced spontaneous erections, and erectile dysfunction) and total testosterone concentrations less than 11 nmol/l (3.2 ng/ml) and free testosterone concentrations less than 220 pmol/l (64 pg/ml). Some men present with the symptoms, but with normal testosterone levels, and some men with low testosterone levels have no symptoms; the reasons for this are not known. Some men in their late 40s and early 50s develop depression, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, and other physical and emotional symptoms such as irritability, loss of muscle mass and reduced ability to exercise, weight gain, lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, or poor concentration; many of these symptoms may arise from a midlife crisis or as the results of a long-term unhealthy lifestyle (smoking, excess drinking, overeating, lack of exercise) and may be best addressed by lifestyle changes, therapy, or antidepressants. If a person has symptoms of late-onset hypogonadism, testosterone is measured by taking blood in the morning on at least two days; while immunoassays are commonly used, mass spectrometry is more accurate and is becoming more widely available. The meaning of the measurement is different depending on many factors that affect how testosterone is made and how it is carried in the blood. Increased concentrations of proteins that bind testosterone in blood occur if the person is older, has hyperthyroidism or liver disease, or is taking anticonvulsant drugs (which are increasingly used for depression and various neuropathies), and decreased concentrations of proteins that bind testosterone occur if the person is obese, has diabetes, has hypothyroidism, has liver disease, or is taking glucocorticoids or androgens, or progestins. If levels are low, conditions that cause primary and secondary hypogonadism need to be ruled out. Due to difficulty and expense of testing, and the ambiguity of the results, screening is not recommended. While some clinical instruments (standard surveys) had been developed as of 2016, their specificity was too low to be useful clinically. Causes Testosterone levels are well-documented to decline with aging at about 1% per year in both men and women after a certain age; the causes are not well understood. Management The significance of a decrease in testosterone levels is debated and its treatment with replacement is controversial. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established in older men with low testosterone levels.. NEJM Perspective piece: . Popular summary: Testosterone replacement therapy should only be started if low levels have been confirmed; in the US, this confirmation is not done about 25% of the time, as of 2015. Testosterone levels should also be monitored during therapy. =Adverse effects= Adverse effects of testosterone supplementation may include increased cardiovascular (CV) events (including strokes and heart attacks) and deaths, especially in men over 65 and men with pre-existing heart conditions. The potential for CV risks from testosterone therapy led the FDA to issue a requirement in 2015 that testosterone pharmaceutical labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. However, the data are mixed, so the European Medicines Agency, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the American College of Endocrinology have stated that no consistent evidence shows that testosterone therapy either increases or decreases cardiovascular risk. Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of pre-existing prostate cancer growth; increased hematocrit, which can require venipuncture to treat; and, exacerbation of sleep apnea. Adverse effects may also include minor side effects such as acne and oily skin, as well as significant hair loss and/or thinning of the hair, which may be prevented with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as finasteride or dutasteride. Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis, leading to, in some cases, infertility. Outcomes  As of 2015, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether testosterone replacement therapy can help with erectile dysfunction in men with late-onset hypogonadism. It appears that testosterone replacement therapy may benefit men with symptoms of frailty who have late-onset hypogonadism. Epidemiology The epidemiology is not clear; 20% of men in their 60s and 30% of men in their 70s have low testosterone; around 5% of men between 70 and 79 have both low testosterone and the symptoms, so are diagnosed with late-onset hypogonadism. The National Health Service describes it as rare. History The impact of low levels of testosterone has been previously reported. In 1944, Heller and Myers identified symptoms of what they labeled the \\"male climacteric\\" including loss of libido and potency, nervousness, depression, impaired memory, the inability to concentrate, fatigue, insomnia, hot flushes, and sweating. Heller and Myers found that their subjects had lower than normal levels of testosterone, and that symptoms decreased dramatically when patients were given replacement doses of testosterone. Society and culture The 1998 book Male Menopause by Jed Diamond, a licensed psychotherapist with a PhD in international health, fueled popular interest in the concept of \\"andropause\\". Diamond regards andropause as a change of life in middle-aged men which has hormonal, physical, psychological, interpersonal, social, sexual, and spiritual aspects. Diamond claims that this change occurs in all men, that it may occur as early as age 45 to 50 and more dramatically after the age of 70 in some men, and that women's and men's experiences are somewhat similar phenomena. The medical community has rejected the term \\"andropause\\" and its supposed parallels with menopause. Compare: Thomas Perls and David J. Handelsman, in a 2015 editorial in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, say that between the ill-defined nature of the diagnosis and the pressure and advertising from drug companies selling testosterone and human- growth hormone, as well as dietary supplement companies selling all kinds of \\"boosters\\" for aging men, the condition is overdiagnosed and overtreated. Perls and Handelsman note that in the US, \\"sales of testosterone increased from $324 million in 2002 to $2 billion in 2012, and the number of testosterone doses prescribed climbed from 100 million in 2007 to half a billion in 2012, not including the additional contributions from compounding pharmacies, Internet, and direct-to-patient clinic sales.\\" Research directions As of 2016, research was necessary to find better ways to measure testosterone and to be better able to understand the measurements in any given person, and to understand why some people with low testosterone do not present with symptoms and some with seemingly adequate levels do present with symptoms. Research was also necessary to better understand the cardiovascular risks of testosterone replacement therapy in older men. A relationship between late-onset hypogonadism and risk of Alzheimer's disease has been hypothesized, and some small clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the prevention of Alzheimer's disease in men with late-onset hypogonadism; as of 2009, results were inconclusive.

The prime powers are those positive integers that are divisible by exactly one prime number; prime powers are also called primary numbers, as in the primary decomposition. PropertiesAlgebraic properties= Prime powers are powers of prime numbers. Every prime power (except powers of 2) has a primitive root; thus the multiplicative group of integers modulo pn (i.e. the group of units of the ring Z/pnZ) is cyclic. The number of elements of a finite field is always a prime power and conversely, every prime power occurs as the number of elements in some finite field (which is unique up to isomorphism). =Combinatorial properties= A property of prime powers used frequently in analytic number theory is that the set of prime powers which are not prime is a small set in the sense that the infinite sum of their reciprocals converges, although the primes are a large set. =Divisibility properties= The totient function (œÜ) and sigma functions (œÉ0) and (œÉ1) of a prime power are calculated by the formulas: :\\\\varphi(p^n) = p^{n-1} \\\\varphi(p) = p^{n-1} (p - 1) = p^n - p^{n-1} = p^n \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{p}\\\\right), :\\\\sigma_0(p^n) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n} p^{0\\\\cdot j} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n} 1 = n+1, :\\\\sigma_1(p^n) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n} p^{1\\\\cdot j} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{n} p^{j} = \\\\frac{p^{n+1} - 1}{p - 1}. All prime powers are deficient numbers. A prime power pn is an n-almost prime. It is not known whether a prime power pn can be an amicable number. If there is such a number, then pn must be greater than 101500 and n must be greater than 1400.

Early life Cousins was born in West Hoboken, New Jersey (which later became Union City). At age 11, he was misdiagnosed with tuberculosis and placed in a sanatorium. Despite this, he was an athletic youth, and he claimed that as a young boy he \\"set out to discover exuberance.\\" Cousins attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx, New York City, graduating on February 3, 1933. He edited the high school paper, \\"The Square Deal,\\" where his editing abilities were already in evidence.Details of Cousins' high school career were found in the private memorabilia of Hilda (Wronker) Taft, a classmate. Cousins received a bachelor's degree from Teachers College, Columbia University, in New York City. Career He joined the staff of the New York Evening Post (now the New York Post) in 1934, and in 1935 was hired by Current History as a book critic. He later ascended to the position of managing editor. He also befriended the staff of the Saturday Review of Literature (later renamed Saturday Review), which had its offices in the same building, and by 1940, joined the staff of that publication as well. He was named editor-in-chief in 1942, a position he would hold until 1972. Under his direction, circulation of the publication increased from 20,000 to 650,000. Cousins's philosophy toward his work was exemplified by his instructions to his staff \\"not just to appraise literature, but to try to serve it, nurture it, safeguard it.\\" Cousins believed that \\"there is a need for writers who can restore to writing its powerful tradition of leadership in crisis.\\" He was a lifetime believer in the power of hope, and in the realism of optimism. One of his well-known lines, \\"Life is an adventure in forgiveness,\\" has survived him. But Cousins had no patience for those who consciously bend truth, whether for personal expediency or in the political sphere. The integrity of words, in speech and in writing, was sacred to him. To his mind, the honest use of words was an absolute value, and the distinguishing mark of the human being. Cousins joined the University of California, Los Angeles faculty in 1978 and became an adjunct professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. He taught ethics and medical literature. His research interest was the connection between attitude and health. His daughter, Sarah Shapiro, who had worked there as a college student, cited the head of SR's advertising department that \\"in 30 years as editor of Saturday Review, my father had never fired anyone.\\" Political views and activism Politically, Cousins was a tireless advocate of liberal causes, such as nuclear disarmament and world peace, which he promoted through his writings in Saturday Review. In a 1984 forum at the University of California, Berkeley, titled \\"Quest for Peace\\", Cousins recalled the long editorial he wrote on August 6, 1945, the day the United States dropped the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. Titled \\"The Modern Man is Obsolete\\", Cousins, who stated that he felt \\"the deepest guilt\\" over the bomb's use on human beings, discussed in the editorial the social and political implications of the atomic bomb and nuclear power. He rushed to get it published the next day in the Review, and the response was considerable, as it was reprinted in newspapers around the country and enlarged into a book that was reprinted in different languages. Following the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy saw that only he could find the terms that would be accepted by Nikita Khrushchev to avert nuclear war. Both sides used unofficial intermediaries to relay messages back and forth outside the usual diplomatic routes. For example Kennedy used Norman Cousins, who was well appreciated in Moscow for his leadership of SANE, the Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy. This helped the two leaders forge the highly successful Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Allen Pietrobon, \\"The Role of Norman Cousins and Track II Diplomacy in the Breakthrough to the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty.\\" Journal of Cold War Studies 18.1 (2016): 60-79. Despite his role as an advocate of liberalism, he jokingly expressed opposition to women entering the workforce. In 1939, upon learning that the number of women in the workforce was close to the number of unemployed males, he offered this solution: \\"Simply fire the women, who shouldn't be working anyway, and hire the men. Presto! No unemployment. No relief rolls. No depression.\\"Ware, Susan. \\"Women and the Great Depression.\\" The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2014. Monument to Norman Cousins at the Hiroshima Peace Park in Japan In the 1950s, Cousins played a prominent role in bringing the Hiroshima Maidens, a group of twenty-five Hibakusha, to the United States for medical treatment. In the 1960s, he began the American-Soviet Dartmouth Conferences for peace process.http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_329C06A5E8FA47C5AAE40EF0BD66C4BD Cousins also wrote a collection of non-fiction books on the same subjects, such as the 1953 Who Speaks for Man? , which advocated a World Federation and nuclear disarmament. He also served as president of the World Federalist Association and chairman of the Committee for Sane Nuclear Policy, which in the 1950s warned that the world was bound for a nuclear holocaust if the threat of the nuclear arms race was not stopped. Cousins became an unofficial ambassador in the 1960s, and his facilitating communication between the Holy See, the Kremlin, and the White House helped lead to the Soviet-American test ban treaty, for which he was thanked by President John F. Kennedy and Pope John XXIII, the latter of whom awarded him his personal medallion. Cousins was also awarded the Eleanor Roosevelt Peace Award in 1963, the Family Man of the Year Award in 1968, the United Nations Peace Medal in 1971, the Niwano Peace Prize and the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism, both in 1990. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1972 to 1975. Illness, laugh therapy and recovery Cousins did research on the biochemistry of human emotions, which he long believed were the key to human beings' success in fighting illness. It was a belief he maintained even as he battled in 1964 a sudden-onset case of a crippling connective tissue disease, which was also referred to as a collagen disease. Experts at Dr. Rusk's rehabilitation clinic confirmed this diagnosis and added a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Told that he had one chance in 500 of recovery, Cousins developed his own recovery program. He took massive intravenous doses of Vitamin C and had self-induced bouts of laughter brought on by films of the television show Candid Camera, and by various comic films. His positive attitude was not new to him, however. He had always been an optimist, known for his kindness to others, and his robust love of life itself. \\"I made the joyous discovery that ten minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep,\\" he reported. \\"When the pain-killing effect of the laughter wore off, we would switch on the motion picture projector again and not infrequently, it would lead to another pain-free interval.\\"Cousins, Norman, Anatomy of an illness as perceived by the patient : reflections on healing and regeneration, introd. by Ren√© Dubos, New York : Norton, 1979. His struggle with that illness and his discovery of laugh therapy is detailed in his 1979 book Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient. In a commentary questioning whether Cousins cured his disease, Florence Ruderman wrote, \\"It seems entirely possible that what Cousins had was an acute attack of an arthritic condition which then subsided, slowly, but quite naturally.\\" Letters to the editor, regarding the above article, are at: Later in life he and his wife Ellen together fought his heart disease, again with exercise, a daily regimen of vitamins, and with the good nutrition provided by Ellen's organic garden.Cousins, Norman, The Healing Heart : Antidotes to Panic and Helplessness, New York : Norton, 1983. He wrote a collection of best-selling non-fiction books on illness and healing, as well as a 1980 autobiographical memoir, Human Options: An Autobiographical Notebook. Movie portrayal Cousins was portrayed by actor Ed Asner in a 1984 television movie, Anatomy of an Illness, which was based on Cousins's 1979 book, Anatomy of an Illness as Perceived by the Patient: Reflections on Healing. Cousins was not pleased with the commercial nature of the movie, and with Hollywood's sensationalistic exaggerations of his experience. He and other members of the Cousins family were also taken aback by the casting of Asner, due to the fact that the two men bore scant physical resemblance to each other. But Asner tried faithfully, Cousins felt, to convey the spirit of his subject, and once the film was completed, Cousins was said by Asner to look upon the movie with a certain degree of tolerance, if not with delight. Death Cousins died of heart failure on November 30, 1990, in Los Angeles, having survived years longer than his doctors predicted: 10 years after his first heart attack, 26 years after his collagen illness, and 36 years after his doctors first diagnosed his heart disease. He and his wife Ellen raised four children: Dr. Andrea Cousins of Northampton, Massachusetts; the now deceased Amy Cousins; Dr. Candis Cousins Kerns of Oakland, California; and writer Sarah Shapiro of Jerusalem, Israel. He is survived by his children and by 26 grandchildren, and he is buried at the Mt. Lebanon Jewish Cemetery in New Jersey, alongside his wife and parents, Samuel Cousins and Sara Miller Cousins.\\"own familial haunting grounds in New Jersey. Mt. Lebanon Jewish Cemetery\\" An obituary containing further information, mainly of his writing and editing career, was published by the December 2, 1990 edition of The New York Times, a day after his death was reported.

He was an advocate of manned space exploration, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). While at NASA, he served as the program manager in charge of long-range planning of deep space manned activities (flights beyond Earth orbit). He was regarded as an expert on the Russian space program. Puttkamer assisted with daily on-orbit operations at NASA from 2009 until 2012. He died of a sudden flu-like illness on . His was given the nickname Jessie by DeForest Kelley, whom Puttkammer called Dee.  Early life  He was born, in Leipzig, to the German noble Puttkamer family with the titular rank of baron (). According to family tradition, each firstborn Puttkamer son is given the forename Jesco. Puttkamer finished high school in Konstanz, and studied mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule (RWTH Aachen University) in Aachen. Career In 1962, Puttkamer left Germany for the United States, where he was recruited into Wernher von Braun's rocket team at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. He was a senior engineer on the Apollo program. His supervisor at Marshall was Ernst Geissler. He was granted United States citizenship in 1967. Puttkammer was a consultant and technical advisor for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), contributing the hypothetical theory behind the faster-than-light space warp drive, and the wormhole effect featured in the film. From 1985 to 2000, he lectured at FH Aachen as an Honorary Professor. In 1995, Puttkamer was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Philosophy by Saarland University for his pioneering contributions to the understanding of space flight. He was a frequent consultant to President George W. Bush during the implementation of the president's Vision for Space Exploration. Puttkamer said that among his most treasured achievements at NASA were: his contributions to the Apollo program; the lunar landing in 1969, which fulfilled President John F. Kennedy's mandate; and recovering America's experimental space station Skylab after its disastrous launch into orbit on . He often spoke of \\"rescuing\\" the backup Skylab from being scrapped, so it could be publicly displayed in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. An interview of Puttkamer by J√∂rg Weigand was published in Perry Rhodan, Issue 2302. He was a guest on ZDF's Nachtstudio in 2009. The episode, hosted by Volker Panzer, titled \\"Moonstruck\\", was a retrospective on German contributions to space exploration, and focused heavily on the Apollo moon landing.  Writing  Puttkamer was the author of more than a dozen books on space flight. He also wrote many science fiction short stories which were published by German pulp magazines, notably Pabel's Utopia Sonderband (with volume #3 renamed to Utopia SF Magazin) (1956‚Äì57) and Moewig's Terra and Terra Astra (1960‚Äì61). His stories have been reprinted frequently since. He also published several serialized essays from 1964 to 1969 for a number of German magazines. His stories, originally published in Utopia SF Magazin, were collected in Elektronengehirne, Wurml√∂cher und Weltmodelle () along with six new stories. The collection was released as part of the Utopia Classics series. The story \\"The Sleeping God\\" was collected in the anthology Star Trek: The New Voyages 2, along with an introduction by Puttkamer where he explains science fiction, like Star Trek, humanizes space, making it \\"more understandable for the young in mind.\\" His German-language memoir and essay of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, \\"Apollo 11: Ausflug in die Mondwelt,\\" was reissued in a Chinese translation in 1982, in Beijing. A revised edition of the essay was included in his book, Abenteuer Apollo 11, released on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.  Awards and honors  * Puttkamer was awarded with numerous accolades while at NASA, among them the Exceptional Service Medal (2004), for outstanding services by a civilian, followed by the NASA Honor Award, for advancing American-Russian cooperation in space flight, in 2007. * In , Puttkamer was honored with the \\"Distinguished German-American of the Year\\" award by the German-American Heritage Foundation of the USA (GAHF). * Asteroid 266725 Vonputtkamer, discovered by Matthias Busch and Rainer Kresken at the ESA Optical Ground Station in 2009, was named in his honor.

In both countries they are generally formed along regional, ethnic or linguistic lines.  Associations of tribes  In Canada, the Indian band, usually consisting of one main community, is the fundamental unit of government. Bands may unite to form a tribal council, but they need not do so. Bands that do not belong to a tribal council are said to be independent. Bands may and do withdraw from tribal councils. Furthermore, the authority that bands delegate to their tribal council varies, with some tribal councils serving as a strong, central organization while others are granted limited power by their members. In the United States, several sovereign American Indian Nations are organized as Tribal Councils. The Navajo Nation, or Dineh, were formally governed by the Navajo Tribal Council, known today as the Navajo Nation Council. The Crow Nation in Montana was once organized as the Crow Tribal Council. Since the late 20th century, the Crow Nation changed their constitution and organized as a three-branch government with a ceremonial Crow Tribal General  Governing bodies  Tribal councils in Canada and the United States have a somewhat different status. In the United States, the term usually describes the governing body of a tribe that is typically distinct from other tribes as a matter of geography, native language, religion and culture. The tribe, usually comprising a single Reservation (although some tribes have more than one, and many have none) is the basic unit of government. Federally recognized tribes in the United States are considered \\"domestic dependent nations\\", and they have sovereign status somewhat comparable to the individual American States. Different tribes may choose governance structures for themselves, but most tribes have adopted democratic governments in which a Tribal Council or the equivalent functions as a legislative body and an elected or appointed Chairman has an executive role comparable to a President or Prime Minister. On a few American Indian reservations such as the Hopi Reservation and the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) reservations, a U.S. or Canadian-recognized and -funded, democratically- elected tribal government operates in parallel, and in some cases, in conflict with, the nation's traditionalist governance.

The city is still confined within its walls, and has a population of just under 300, but it is contiguous with the town of Rabat, which takes its name from the Arabic word for suburb, and has a population of over 11,000 (as of March 2014). The city was founded as Maleth in around the 8th century BC by Phoenician settlers, and was later renamed Melite by the Romans. Ancient Melite was larger than present-day Mdina, and it was reduced to its present size during the Byzantine or Arab occupation of Malta. During the latter period, the city adopted its present name, which derives from the Arabic word . The city remained the capital of Malta throughout the Middle Ages, until the arrival of the Order of St. John in 1530, when Birgu became the administrative centre of the island. Mdina experienced a period of decline over the following centuries, although it saw a revival in the early 18th century. At this point, it acquired several Baroque features, although it did not lose its medieval character. Mdina remained the centre of the Maltese nobility and religious authorities (and property continues to largely be passed down from families and from generation to generation), but it never regained its pre-1530 importance, giving rise to the popular nickname the \\"Silent City\\" by both locals and visitors. Mdina is on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and it is now one of the main tourist attractions in Malta. HistoryAntiquity= The plateau on which Mdina is built has been inhabited since prehistory, and by the Bronze Age it was a place of refuge since it was naturally defensible. The Phoenicians colonized Malta in around the 8th century BC, and they founded the city of Maleth on this plateau. It was taken over by the Roman Republic in 218 BC, becoming known as Melite. The Punic-Roman city was about three times the size of present-day Mdina, extending into a large part of modern Rabat. According to Early Modern interpretation the Acts of the Apostles, when Paul the Apostle was shipwrecked on Malta in 60 AD, he was greeted by Publius, the governor of Melite, and he cured his sick father. According to tradition, the population of Melite converted to Christianity, and Publius became the first Bishop of Malta and then Bishop of Athens before being martyred in 112 AD. Very few remains of the Punic-Roman city survive today. The most significant are the ruins of the Domvs Romana, in which several well-preserved mosaics, statues and other remains were discovered. Remains of the podium of a Temple of Apollo, fragments of the city walls and some other sites have also been excavated. =Medieval period= At some point following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, it has been suggested that it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the threat from the Arabs increased. In 870, Byzantine Melite, which was ruled by governor Amros (probably Ambrosios), was besieged by Aghlabids led by Halaf al-HƒÅdim. He was killed in the fighting, and SawƒÅda Ibn Mu·∏•ammad was sent from Sicily to continue the siege following his death. The duration of the siege is unknown, but it probably lasted for some weeks or months. After Melite fell to the invaders, the inhabitants were massacred, the city was destroyed and its churches were looted. Marble from Melite's churches was used to build the castle of Sousse.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/41626/1/Malta_fiz- zmien_nofsani_1989.pdf According to Al-Himyarƒ´, Malta remained almost uninhabited until it was resettled in 1048 or 1049 by a Muslim community and their slaves, who built a settlement called Medina on the site of Melite. Archaeological evidence suggests that the city was already a thriving Muslim settlement by the beginning of the 11th century, so 1048‚Äì49 might be the date when the city was officially founded and its walls were constructed. The layout of the new city was completely different to that of ancient Melite. Mdina still has features typical of a medina, a legacy of the period of Arab rule. The Byzantines besieged Medina in 1053‚Äì54, but were repelled by its defenders. The city surrendered peacefully to Roger I of Sicily after a short siege in 1091, and Malta was subsequently incorporated into the County and later the Kingdom of Sicily, being dominated by a succession of feudal lords. A castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati was built on the southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, probably on the site of an earlier Byzantine fort. The population of Malta during the fifteenth century was about 10,000, with town life limited to Mdina, Birgu and the Gozo Citadel. Mdina was comparatively small and partly uninhabited and by 1419, it was already outgrown by its suburb, Rabat. Under Aragonese rule, local government rested on the Universit√†, a communal body based in Mdina, which collected taxation and administered the islands' limited resources. At various points during the fifteenth century, this town council complained to its Aragonese overlords that the islands were at the mercy of the sea and the saracens. The city withstood a siege by Hafsid invaders in 1429. While the exact number of casualties or Maltese who were carried into slavery is unknown, the islands suffered depopulation in this raid. =Hospitaller rule= its fortifications When the Order of Saint John took over in Malta in 1530, the nobles ceremoniously handed over the keys of the city to Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, but the Order settled in Birgu and Mdina lost its status as capital city. In the 1540s, the fortifications began to be upgraded during the magistracy of Juan de Homedes y Coscon, and in 1551 the city withstood a brief Ottoman attack. During the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, Mdina was the base of the Order's cavalry, which made occasional sorties on the invading Ottomans. On 7 August 1565, the cavalry attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans attempted to take Mdina in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when the city fired its cannon, leading them to believe that it had ammunition to spare. After the siege, Maltese military engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up plans to reduce Mdina's size by half and turning it into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The fortifications were again upgraded in the mid-17th century, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Mdina suffered severe damage during the 1693 Sicily earthquake, although no casualties were reported the 13th-century Cathedral of St. Paul was partially destroyed, and it was rebuilt by Lorenzo Gaf√† in the Baroque style between 1697 and 1703. On 3 November 1722, newly elected Grand Master Ant√≥nio Manoel de Vilhena issued orders for the restoration and renovation of Mdina. This renovation was entrusted to the French architect and military engineer Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, who introduced strong French Baroque elements into what was still a largely medieval city. At this point, large parts of the fortifications and the city entrance were completely rebuilt. The remains of the Castellu di la Chitati were demolished to make way for Palazzo Vilhena, while the main gate was walled up and a new Mdina Gate was built nearby. Several public buildings were also built, including the Banca Giuratale and the Corte Capitanale. The last major addition to the Mdina fortifications was Despuig Bastion, which was completed in 1746. =French occupation and British rule= Plaque near the Torre dello Standardo commemorating six Maltese people who were killed during the uprising of September 1798 On 10 June 1798, Mdina was captured by French forces without much resistance during the French invasion of Malta. A French garrison remained in the city, but a Maltese uprising broke out on 2 September of that year. The following day, rebels entered the city through a sally port and massacred the garrison of 65 men. These events marked the beginning of a two-year uprising and blockade, and the Maltese set up a National Assembly which met at Mdina's Banca Giuratale. The rebels were successful, and in 1800 the French surrendered and Malta became a British protectorate. From 1883 to 1931, Mdina was linked with Valletta by the Malta Railway. =Present day= Today, Mdina is one of Malta's major tourist attractions, hosting about 750,000 tourists a year. No cars (other than a limited number of residents, emergency vehicles, wedding cars and horses) are allowed in Mdina, partly why it has earned the nickname 'the Silent City'.

Verona Rupes is a cliff on Miranda, a moon of Uranus. The cliff face, previously thought to be from high, as of 2016 is estimated to be high, which makes it the tallest known cliff in the Solar System. It may have been created by a major impact, which caused the moon to disrupt and reassemble, or by the crust rifting. Given Miranda's low gravity, it would take about 12 minutes to fall from the top, reaching the bottom at the speed of about 200 km/h. Even so, the fall might be survivable given proper airbag protection.

In cars, the rear-view mirror is usually affixed to the top of the windshield on a double-swivel mount allowing it to be adjusted to suit the height and viewing angle of any driver and to swing harmlessly out of the way if impacted by a vehicle occupant in a collision. The rear-view mirror is augmented by one or more side-view mirrors, which serve as the only rear-vision mirrors on trucks, motorcycles and bicycles.  History  Ray Harroun's Marmon \\"Wasp\\" with its rear-view mirror mounted on struts above the car on display in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. Among the rear-view mirror's early uses is a mention by Dorothy Levitt in her 1909 book The Woman and the Car which noted that women should \\"carry a little hand-mirror in a convenient place when driving\\" so they may \\"hold the mirror aloft from time to time in order to see behind while driving in traffic\\". However, earlier use is described in 1906, in a trade magazine noting mirrors for showing what is coming behind now popular on closed bodied automobiles, and to likely be widely adopted in a short time.The Automobile (weekly), Thursday, 27 December 1906, p. 910 The same year, a Mr. Henri Cain from France patented a \\"Warning mirror for automobiles\\". The Argus Dash Mirror, adjustable to any position to see the road behind, appeared in 1908.Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal, 1 December 1908, p249 Earliest known rear-view mirror mounted on a racing vehicle appeared on Ray Harroun's Marmon race car at the inaugural Indianapolis 500 race in 1911.Ward's Auto World: Rearview Mirror Harroun himself claimed he got the idea from seeing a mirror used for a similar purpose on a horse-drawn vehicle in 1904.Davidson, Donald The Talk of Gasoline Alley (radio program). Accessed via WIBC (FM), 28 May 2006 Harroun also claimed that the mirror vibrated constantly due to the rough brick surface, and it was rendered largely useless. Elmer Berger is usually credited with inventing the rear-view mirror, though in fact he was the first to patent it (1921) and develop it for incorporation into production street going automobiles by his Berger and Company.  Augmentations and alternatives  Recently, rear-view video cameras have been built into many new model cars, this was partially in response to the rear-view mirrors' inability to show the road directly behind the car, due to the rear deck or trunk obscuring as much as 3‚Äì5 meters (10‚Äì15 feet) of road behind the car. As many as 50 small children are killed by SUVs every year in the USA because the driver cannot see them in their rear-view mirrors. Camera systems are usually mounted to the rear bumper or lower parts of the car, allowing for better rear visibility. There are three types of rearview cameras. ''' Surface Mounted Flush Mounted License Mounted Surface Mounted Cameras These cameras are mounted on a flat surface of the vehicle by focusing them high up. By doing so they provide a perfect view and an excellent depth perception. These features make this type of camera to be more efficient and that‚Äôs why they are chosen for larger vehicles so they would produce a better picture with a wider angle. Flush Mounted Cameras Flush mounted cameras can be installed in any hole that is present in the backside of the vehicle so that they produce a nice and clean image. Though they provide a clear image it is not possible for these types of rearview cameras to provide a deeper view as the surface mounted camera unit. License Mounted Cameras It is usually mounted on an existing license plate hole which may not require drilling of new holes to mount the camera. Thus they can be installed easily. The camera is placed depending on the placement of the license plate in the car Aftermarket secondary rear-view mirrors are available. They attach to the main rear-view mirror and are independently adjustable to view the back seat. This is useful to enable adults to monitor children in the back seat.  Anti-glare  Glare from a following vehicle's headlamps in a rear view mirror A prismatic rear-view mirror‚Äîsometimes called a \\"day/night mirror\\"‚Äîcan be tilted to reduce the brightness and glare of lights, mostly for high-beam headlights of vehicles behind which would otherwise be reflected directly into the driver's eyes at night. This type of mirror is made of a piece of glass that is wedge-shaped in cross-section‚Äîits front and rear surfaces are not parallel. On manual tilt versions, a tab is used to adjust the mirror between \\"day\\" and \\"night\\" positions. In the day view position, the front surface is tilted and the reflective back side gives a strong reflection. When the mirror is moved to the night view position, its reflecting rear surface is tilted out of line with the driver's view. This view is actually a reflection of the low-reflection front surface; only a much-reduced amount of light is reflected in the driver's eyes. \\"Manual tilt\\" day/night mirrors first began appearing in the 1930s and became standard equipment on most passenger cars and trucks by the early 1970s. =Automatic dimming= In the 1940s, American inventor Jacob Rabinow developed a light- sensitive automatic mechanism for the wedge-type day/night mirror. Several Chrysler Corporation cars offered these automatic mirrors as optional equipment as early as 1959, but few customers ordered them for their cars and the item was soon withdrawn from the option lists. Several automakers began offering rear-view mirrors with automatic dimming again in 1983, and it was in the late 1980s that they began to catch on in popularity. Current systems usually use photosensors mounted in the rear-view mirror to detect light and dim the mirror by means of electrochromism. This electrochromic feature has also been incorporated into side-view mirrors allowing them to dim and reduce glare as well.  Trucks and buses  On trucks and buses, the load often blocks rearward vision out the backlight. In the U.S. virtually all trucks and buses have a side view mirror on each side, often mounted on the doors and viewed out the side windows, which are used for near vision. These mirrors leave a large unviewable (\\"blind\\") area behind the vehicle, which tapers down as the distance increases. This is a safety issue which the driver must compensate for, often with a person guiding the truck back in congested areas, or by backing in a curve. \\"Spot mirrors\\", a convex mirror which provides a distorted image of the entire side of the vehicle, are commonly mounted on at least the right side of a vehicle. In the U.S. mirrors are considered \\"safety equipment\\", and are not included in width restrictions.  Motorcycles  Depending on the type of motorcycle, the motorcycle may or may not have rear- view mirrors. Street-legal motorcycles are generally required to have rear- view mirrors. Motorcycles for off-road use only normally do not have rear-view mirrors. Rear-view mirrors come in various shapes and designs and have various methods of mounting the mirrors to the motorcycle, most commonly to the handlebars. Rear-view mirrors can also be attached to the rider's motorcycle helmet. Other uses Bicycles = A bicycle with rear-view mirrors formerly on an automobile Some bicycles are equipped with a rear-view mirror mounted on a handlebar. Rear-view mirrors may also be fitted to the bicycle frame, on a helmet on the arm or the frame of a pair of eyeglasses. This allows what is behind to be checked continuously without turning round. Rear- view mirrors almost never come with a new bicycle and require an additional purchase. =Aircraft= In 1956, the Civil Aeronautical Administration proposed a rear-view mirror mounted right above the pilot to keep an eye when private aircraft are landing or taxiing on the runway to prevent collisions.\\"Periscopes for Aircraft\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1956, p. 142. Fighter aircraft usually have one or more rear-view mirrors mounted on the front canopy frame to watch out for chasing aircraft. = Computer monitors = Some computer monitors are fitted with rear-view mirrors to see if anyone is positioned behind the user where they can see sensitive information, such as names and passwords, being keyed in or on the screen. These are used especially on automated teller machines and similar.

Clerck came from a family in the petty nobility and entered the University of Uppsala in 1726. Little is known of his studies; although a contemporary of Linnaeus, it is unknown whether he had any contact with him during his time in Uppsala. His limited means forced him to leave university early and enter into government service, later ending up working in the administration of the City of Stockholm. Original figure of male and female Araneus angulatus on Plate 1 in Clerck's Svenska Spindlar His interest in natural history appears to have come at a more mature age, influenced by a lecture of Linnaeus he attended in Stockholm in 1739. In the following years he collected and categorized many spiders, published together with more general observations on the morphology and behaviour of spiders, in his Svenska Spindlar (\\"Swedish spiders\\", 1757, also known by its Latin subtitle, Aranei Suecici). He also started the publication of Icones insectorum rariorum, a series of detailed but uncommented plates illustrating numerous species of butterflies, left unfinished after the third fascicle (1766) because of Clerck's death. Title page of the 1757 edition of Clerck's Svenska Spindlar Because of the exceptionally thorough treatment of the spider species, the scientific names proposed by Clerck in Svenska Spindlar (which were adopted by Carl Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 with only minor modifications) had traditionally been recognized by arachnologists as binomial and available, later this was officially recognized in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.ICZN Code Art. 3.1 This means that in case of doubt the spelling of a spider name as from Clerck's 1757 work has priority over that proposed by Linnaeus in 1758 (an example is Araneus instead of Aranea), and that Clerck's spiders were the first animals in modern zoology to have obtained an available scientific name in the Linnean system. The name of the first species to have obtained an available name in the binomial system was Araneus angulatus. He eventually became a friend and correspondent of Linnaeus, who appreciated his work greatly, and through his sponsorship was elected a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala in 1756 and of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1764.

As a provider of care since 1933, the Hornsby Ku- ring-gai Hospital is a major metropolitan hospital, and is a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney. It provides hospital care for around 300,000 people living in the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai area. The Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Health Service also incorporates six Community Health Centres and ten Early Childhood Centres. The hospital is under the control of the Northern Sydney Local Health District having previously been a part of the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service. While much of the hospital is of a ramshackle design, the main building is a two-storey circular design (named the Lumby Building for its benefactor), which forms the emblem of the hospital. Development The Emergency, Paediatrics and Maternity building was opened in late 2006. It is called the HOPE Building (Hospital's Obstetrics, Paediatrics, & Emergency) and now also houses an emergency Mental Health Unit the PECC. In late 2013 the Mental Health Centre building was opened. On 5 September 2015, the STAR Building (Surgical, Theatres, Anesthetic, Recovery) was officially opened by NSW Minister for Health Jillian Skinner. The hospital is currently undergoing major building works. A new Medical Assessment Unit (MAU) has been created from the renovated remains of the old Emergency Department. The Social Work department now has new offices opposite the Fresh Plus Cafe. Major construction of new Mental Health and Drug, Alcohol & Gambling Services buildings including a Mental Health ICU have significantly improved care provision in the area. The old maternity building along with much of the campus is due to be redeveloped. In popular culture Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital was featured in episodes of the TV series Sons and Daughters in 1984 when character Gordon Hamilton was treated for a heart attack there. It was also used frequently to film episodes of the Australian medical drama series All Saints where the historic lions outside the, soon to be demolished, \\"old\\" maternity building were featured.  Supplementary facilities  Many houses in the surrounding streets, especially in Palmerston Road, have been converted to medical practices, such as ophthalmology, ear nose and throat, and other specialists.

Etymology The word gravlax comes from the Scandinavian word gr√§va/grave (\\"to dig\\"; modern sense \\"to cure (fish)\\") which goes back to the Proto-Germanic *grabƒÖ, *grab≈ç (\\"hole in the ground; ditch, trench; grave\\") and the Indo-European root *ghrebh- \\"to dig, to scratch, to scrape\\",Svenska Akademiens ordbok, \\"grav \\", column G851; \\"grava column G868; and [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grave and lax/laks, \\"salmon\\". History During the Middle Ages, gravlax was made by fishermen, who salted the salmon and lightly fermented it by burying it in the sand above the high- tide line. Fermentation is no longer used in the production process. Instead the salmon is \\"buried\\" in a dry marinade of salt, sugar, and dill, and cured for twelve hours to a few days. As the salmon cures, by the action of osmosis, the moisture turns the dry cure into a highly concentrated brine, which can be used in Scandinavian cooking as part of a sauce. This same method of curing can be employed for any fatty fish, but salmon is the most commonly used. See also    * ReferencesBibliography * .

The school is named after the city of Arica, Chile, where Ichazo once lived and where he led an intensive months-long training in 1970 and 1971 before settling in the United States where the Arica Institute (incorporated in 1971) has since been headquartered. The Arica School can be considered, as Ramparts magazine put it in 1973, \\"A body of techniques for cosmic consciousness- raising and an ideology to relate to the world in an awakened way.\\"Ramparts Magazine, July 1973, p. 30. (online reproduction) Origins The Arica School's origins began in 1956 when groups of people formed in major cities in South America to study the theory and method that Ichazo was proposing. For fourteen years these different groups studied his teachings. In 1968 Ichazo presented lectures on his theories of Protoanalysis and the ego-fixations at the Institute of Applied Psychology in Santiago, Chile. Ichazo's theories are based upon such traditional metaphysical questions such as: \\"What is humankind?\\"; \\"What is the supreme good of humanity?\\"; and \\"What is the truth that gives meaning and value to human life?\\" Basic theory The entire theory is referred to as based on the idea of the Innate Structure of Mind. That is, the questions come from the Instincts and the Instincts are a result of a pre-existing structure that is the foundation of Mind itself. It is a concept considered logical because there must be a pre-existing order if all minds share essential similarities. Ichazo, Oscar. The Human Process for Enlightenment and Freedom. 1976. Page 79. Ichazo refined the ancient concept that a human soul has components by approaching the issue through three instinctual questions that he considered basic to human existence: \\"How am I?\\", \\"Who am I with?\\", \\"What am I doing?\\"Ichazo, Oscar. Between Metaphysics and Protoanalysis. 1982. Page 47, 50, 51, 58. Ichazo labeled these conservation, relations, and syntony (later modified to adaptation). Recognizing interactions among the three, he developed a 3 x 3 = 9 component system, which he correlated with several schemas that have long existed in diverse fields: spectrum of light, chakras, physiological systems, the enneagram, etc.Ichazo, Oscar. The Human Process for Enlightenment and Freedom. 1976. But he didn‚Äôt originally develop the enneagram. Page 79. For example, each component of the psyche was assigned a corresponding color, which was reinforced through a wide variety of self-development exercises. The Hypergnostic (exaggerated perception) meditation utilized the ancient notion of vertically arranged chakras, expanding the seven chakra system widely used in Hindu meditation into nine by adding the sacrum and the nape of the neck. Modern biology was incorporated into the theory by associating the hypergnostic rings (chakras) with anatomy rather than energy centers.Nine Hypergnostic Systems workbooks provided by Arica Institute as student materials 1976 and later. For self-observation of habitual patterns, Ichazo employed the enneagram, among other tools. Transformative practices sometimes involved linking a specific mudra and/or bija with each of the nine points of the enneagram. During the first three decades or so, most aspects of his theory that were mapped onto the enneagram were circular mappings (e.g., closing of the spectrum into a circular Rainbow Eye) that involved little or no utilization of the interconnecting lines that constitute the enneagram's form.\\"Movement in the psychic spectrum\\" pp 64‚Äì66 of Human Process.Ichazo, Oscar. Opening the Rainbow Eye. 1978.Ichazo, Oscar. Cutting of the Adamantine Pyramid. 1980. In other words, most of the maps were enneagons rather than enneagrams (refer to enneagram figure for drawings that show the difference). Essence and ego Like some other systems of self-actualization, Arica works with the (ultimately illusory) separation of essence and ego.Interview with Sam Keen, Psychology Today, July 1973. Reproduced in Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, published by Arica Institute Press 1982. Page 9 ff. An important aspect of this work is to observe one's habits and reactions in accordance with a typology of nine. However, Ichazo referred to the characterizations as \\"fixations\\" rather than \\"personality types\\" and he repeatedly emphasized that every human being contains all nine types (\\"we have to awaken all the nine positions\\").Letters to the School, page 73. The fixation was simply a key to self-discovery,Letters to the School, page 72. not a form of identity like one's sun sign in astrology. The inherent difficulty of working with the ego and essence distinction while maintaining an ultimate philosophical stance of nondualism can be appreciated by mystics of any path. Such \\"inner work\\" entails the risk of inflating one's ego with notions such as \\"I am a special person because I have higher knowledge\\" or \\"I am aware of my ego, but you are not aware of yours\\". To avoid problems that could arise from this delicate type of work, Ichazo emphasized group exercises and honest interpersonal encounters (\\"ego reduction\\"). He also insisted on secrecy, specifically not propagating the theory without his permission. With this essential context in mind a person is prepared to understand Ichazo's position in the enneagram controversy. Enneagram of Personality Ichazo is considered by many to be the father of the Enneagram of Personality (usually just called the Enneagram) movement which uses an enneagram figure. The United States Court of AppealsArica v. Palmer, 970 F 2d 106 ruled that Ichazo is the original author of the application of the enneagram figure to a theory of ego fixations (which are the precursor to personality disorders). However, this ruling denied copyright injunction under the \\"fair use\\" doctrine of copyright law. Because the enneagram symbol is a discovery (not an invention), the legal issue was not use of the symbol but rather the copyrightability of specific \\"enneagrams\\", meaning symbol plus descriptive words (or other information) associated with each point. Ichazo had earlier described the enneagrams as a set of immutable lawsLetters to the School, page 43. but he had also said that he \\"developed\\" the enneagrams.Letters to the School, page 46. Ichazo has applied the enneagram figure in connection with his theory of mechanical ego mechanisms which grow out of psychological traumas suffered at an early age in specific aspects of the human psyche.Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, page 14. In his basic theory, these aspects of the human psyche include the sense of well- being (conservation instinct); the sense of relations with others (relation instinct); and the sense of adapting to our environment (adaptation instinct). Ichazo's goal with regard to the study of the enneagram is to facilitate the recognition of repetitive, mechanistic thinking and behavior in a person's psychological process and to eliminate the suffering rooted in the attachment to, and identification with, these mechanisms (which, Ichazo teaches, attempt to protect us from suffering but actually tend to perpetuate it).Interviews with Oscar Ichazo, page 11. The popular use of the Enneagram of Personality (as contrasted with the use of enneagrams within the Arica School) began principally with Claudio Naranjo who had studied with Ichazo in Chile. Ichazo considers Naranjo's understanding of the Enneagram to be limited and incomplete.\\"Interview with Professor Effross\\", Arica School website Naranjo's major contribution to the Enneagram of Personality was his addition of defense mechanisms to the model developed by Ichazo: \\"His contribution to the Enneagram successfully joined the insight and methods of a mystical path of transformation with the intellectual power of a Western psychological model.\\" Influences It has been suggested that Ichazo \\"either came under the influence of the school that taught G.I. Gurdjieff or, at least, studied under students of Gurdjieff.\\"Tart, Charles. Transpersonal Psychologies. Harper & Row, 1975, p. 331. Ichazo, however, has denied any connection between his and Gurdjieff's teachings.http://www.arica.org/articles/trletter.cfm Some writers in the Enneagram of Personality field have claimed that the enneagram figure is a Sufi symbol. Although the symbolism of the number 9 is ancient,\\"The eight is the way to the nine.\\" The Sufis, Idries Shah. Octagon Press. Fifth Impression, 1989. p. 191. there does not appear to be any evidence for the enneagram figure before GurdjieffOuspensky, P.D. In Search of the Miraculous, 1949. p. 287. in Sufism or elsewhere.Goldberg, Michael. \\"Inside the Enneagram Wars\\" in the LA Weekly, October 15, 1993. As presented in later years (post-2000), a large part of Arica is the study of classical philosophy as compared to \\"modern\\" philosophy. This is a departure from the early 1990s when Ichazo was intent on correlating Arica with Tantric Buddhism.The Arican, 20th Anniversary Edition. 1990. In recent years, Ichazo has pointedly asserted that his understanding of the Enneagram originated with reading classical philosophy and Plotinus' Enneads and not as any consequence of any writing or work of Gurdjieff. In Interviews With Oscar Ichazo he states that he encountered the enneagram figure before he encountered the works of Gurdjieff, implying that it was before he joined (circa 1950) a group of mystics in Buenos Aires that included some people who had participated in the Fourth Way work presented by Gurdjieff. Protoanalysis The tools that the Arica School teaches are called the ‚ÄúProtoanalytical Theory, System and Method‚Äù or \\"Protoanalysis\\". Before 1980, the term \\"protoanalysis\\" was misunderstood to be narrower in scope, used specifically as the name for Ichazo's theory of types, from which the Enneagram of Personality was derived. Protoanalysis is proposed by Ichazo to be a comprehensive analysis of the complete human being, from the grossest aspects of the human process (e.g., enneagramatic and mentational analyses of human anatomy and physiology), progressing systematically to the higher states of consciousness where enlightenment can be attained (e.g., the direct and ceaseless experience of non-dual union with the Divine). The Arica School presents a detailed map of the human psyche that aims to serve as a guide for discovering the basis of one's ego process, enabling individuals to transcend that process into a higher state of consciousness that is found in and available to every person. This state of being is seen as the recognition of one's true essential self, experienced as an internal state of great happiness, light, and liberation.

The idea was pioneered by German architect Albert Speer while planning for the 1936 Summer Olympics and published as \\"The Theory of Ruin Value\\" (Die Ruinenwerttheorie), although he was not its original inventor. The intention did not stretch only to the eventual collapse of the buildings, but rather assumed such buildings were inherently better designed and more imposing during their period of use. The idea was supported by Adolf Hitler, who planned for such ruins to be a symbol of the greatness of the Third Reich, just as Ancient Greek and Roman ruins were symbolic of those civilisations.  Albert Speer  The Parthenon as an example of aesthetically pleasing ruins Aerial view of the ruins of the Bank of England by Sir John Soane (1830). Imaginary View of the Grand Gallery of the Louvre in Ruins by Hubert Robert (1796). In his memoirs, Albert Speer claimed to have invented the idea, which he referred to as the theory of Ruin Value (Gr. Ruinenwerttheorie). It was supposedly an extension of Gottfried Semper's views about using \\"natural\\" materials and the avoidance of iron girders. In reality it was a much older concept, even becoming a Europe-wide Romantic fascination at one point. Predecessors include a \\"new ruined castle\\" built by the Landgraf of Hesse-Kassel in the 18th century, and the designs for the Bank of England built in the 19th century produced by Sir John Soane. When he presented the bank's governors with three oil sketches of the planned building one of them depicted it when it would be new, another when it would be weathered, and a third what its ruins would look like a thousand years onward. Speer's memoirs reveal Hitler's thoughts about Nazi state architecture in relation to Roman imperial architecture: reshaped Berlin. Hitler accordingly approved Speer's recommendation that, in order to provide a \\"bridge to tradition\\" to future generations, modern \\"anonymous\\" materials such as steel girders and ferroconcrete should be avoided in the construction of monumental party buildings, since such materials would not produce aesthetically acceptable ruins like those wherever possible. Thus, the most politically significant buildings of the Reich were intended, to some extent, even after falling into ruins after thousands of years, to resemble their Roman models. Speer expressed his views on the matter in the Four Year Plan of 1937 in his contribution Stone Not Iron in which he published a photograph of the Parthenon with the subscript: \\"The stone buildings of antiquity demonstrate in their condition today the permanence of natural building materials.\\" Later, after saying modern buildings rarely last more than fifty years, he continues: \\"The ages-old stone buildings of the Egyptians and the Romans still stand today as powerful architectural proofs of the past of great nations, buildings which are often ruins only because man's lust for destruction has made them such.\\" Hitler approved Speer's \\"Law of Ruin Value\\" (Gr. Ruinengesetz) after Speer had shown him a sketch of the Haupttrib√ºne as an ivy-covered ruin. The drawing pleased Hitler but scandalised his entourage. However, due to the onset of the Second World War, Nazi German architecture made extensive use of concrete.  Modern planned ruins  A more modern example of intended ruins were the planned warning signs for the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain (see Human Interference Task Force), which were intended to endure for 10,000 years, and yet still convey an enduring (if negative) impression on future generations: \\"Keep out. Don't dig here.\\" Architect Charles Jencks mentions \\"Ruins in the Garden\\", a section of the Neue Staatsgalerie, as a postmodern subversion of ruin value.

It is a coming-of-age story of the protagonist Shinji and his romance with Hatsue, the beautiful daughter of the wealthy ship owner Terukichi. For this book, Mishima was awarded the Shincho Prize from Shinchosha Publishing in 1954. It has been adapted for film five times.  Plot  Shinji Kubo lives with his mother, a pearl diver, and his younger brother, Hiroshi. He and his mother support the family because Shinji's father died in World War II after the fishing boat he was on was strafed by an American bomber. However, the family lives a somewhat peaceful life and Shinji is content to be a fisherman along with his master, Jukichi Oyama, and another apprentice, Ryuji. Things change when Terukichi Miyata, after the death of his son, decides to bring back the daughter he adopted away to pearl divers from another island. Raised as a pearl diver, the beautiful Hatsue wins many admirers, including Shinji. The prospect of marrying Hatsue becomes even more attractive when the wealthy Miyata intends to adopt the man who marries Hatsue as his own son. Shinji and Hatsue soon fall in love. When Chiyoko, the daughter of the Lighthouse-Keeper and his wife, returns from studying at a university in Tokyo, she is disappointed to discover Shinji, whom she has affections for, has fallen in love with someone else. She takes advantage of the jealous Yasuo Kawamoto, an arrogant and selfish admirer of Hatsue, and uses him so Yasuo will spread vicious rumours of Shinji stealing away Hatsue's virginity. Yasuo is jealous of Shinji because he thinks Shinji will take Hatsue's virginity. He tries to rape Hatsue at night when it's Hatsue's turn to fill out the bucket of water. The attempt is unsuccessful, however; he is stung by hornets as he tries to strip her clothes off. Humiliated, he makes a deal with Hatsue: He will refill the bucket and carry it down the stone steps for her, and Hatsue must not tell anyone he was trying to rape her. When Terukichi finds out the rumor, he forbids Hatsue to see Shinji, but through Jukichi and Ryuji, the two manage to continue communicating with one another by means of secret letters. Terukichi steadfastly refuses to see Shinji for an explanation and when Shinji's mother, who knows her son will never deliberately lie, goes to see Terukichi, Terukichi's refusal to see her only increases the tension between Shinji and Hatsue. Chiyoko, before returning to Tokyo, becomes filled with remorse after Shinji off-handedly replies that she is pretty when she asks him if he thinks she is unattractive. She returns to Tokyo with guilt that she ruined Shinji's chance at happiness Terukichi mysteriously employs Yasuo and Shinji on one of his shipping vessels. When the vessel is caught in a storm, Shinji‚Äôs courage and willpower allow him to brave the storm and save the ship. Terukichi's intentions are revealed when Chiyoko's mother receives a letter from Chiyoko, who refuses to return home, explaining that she feels she cannot return and see Shinji unhappy because she was the one who started the rumors. The lighthouse keeper's wife confronts Terukichi, who reveals that he intends to adopt Shinji as Hatsue's husband. Employing the boys on the ship had been a test to which one was most suitable for his daughter and Shinji's act to save the vessel had earned Terukichi‚Äôs respect and permission to wed his daughter.

It is the largest passage grave of the Br√∫ na B√≥inne complex. It consists of a large mound (known as Site 1) and 17 smaller satellite tombs. The mound is about high and in diameter, covering roughly a hectare. It contains two passages placed along an east-west line and is encircled by 127 kerbstones, of which three are missing, and four badly damaged. The large mound has been estimated to date from c. 3200 BC. The passages are independent of each other, leading to separate burial chambers. The eastern passage arrives at a cruciform chamber, not unlike that found at Newgrange, which contains three recesses and basin stones into which the cremated remains of the dead were placed. The right-hand recess is larger and more elaborately decorated with megalithic art than the others, which is typical for Irish passage graves of this type. The western passage ends in an undifferentiated chamber, which is separated from the passage by a sill stone. The chamber seems to have also contained a basin stone which was later removed and is now located about two-thirds down the passageway. Megalithic art Megalithic art Knowth contains more than a third of the total number of examples of megalithic art in all of Western Europe; over 200 decorated stones were found during excavations. Much of the artwork is found on the kerbstones, particularly approaching the entrances to the passages. Many of the motifs are typical: spirals, lozenges and serpentiform. However, the megalithic art at Knowth contains a wide variety of images, such as crescent shapes, and the oldest known illustration of the moon in history. Much of this artwork was carved on the backs of the stones; a type of megalithic art known as hidden art. This suggests all manner of theories as regards the function of megalithic art within the Neolithic community who built the monuments in the Boyne valley. It is possible that they intended the art to be hidden. It is also possible that they simply recycled the stones and reused the other side. History There is some evidence for late Neolithic and Bronze Age activity on the site. Most of this stems from the existence of a grooved ware timber circle located near the entrance to the eastern passage. Archeological evidence suggests that this was used as a ritual or sacred area after the great mound at Knowth had already fallen into disuse. Evidence for ritual consists of a large number of votive offerings found in and around the immediate areas of the timbers that formed the circle. Eastern passage The hill at Knowth fell into disrepair, and the mound or cairn slipped, causing the entrances to both passages to be covered. The site remained practically unused for a period of two thousand years. The site was briefly used as a burial site; some 35 cist graves were found on the site during excavations.O'Brien, Elizabeth. \\"Post-Roman Britain to Anglo-Saxon England\\". British Archaeological Reports, 1999. 27. In the late Iron Age and early Christian period, it became a hill fort with encircling ditches and souterrains added. Knowth became a habitational site for the first time. Two ditches were dug, one at the base of the mound behind the kerbstones, and the other at the top. At this stage, the entrances to both passages seem to have been discovered. Evidence includes early Christian graffiti on the stones in the eastern chamber, and four names were carved in ogham. It seems it was at this stage that the basin stone from the western chamber was moved in an attempt to remove it and was abandoned in the passage because it got stuck. Knowth became a significant political site and the capital of the Kingdom of Northern Brega.Stout, Geraldine. \\"Newgrange and the Bend of the Boyne\\". Cork: Cork University Press, 2002. 76. After a brief military interlude following the Norman invasion of Ireland, when the Normans used Knowth as a motte in the 12th century, the site came into the possession of the Cistercian monks of Mellifont Abbey. It seems that the mound was then again used as a grange or farm. Stone walls were built over the mound, and stone buildings within the walls. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the site was used mainly for agriculture until most of the site was taken over by the state in 1939. Kerbstone with spirals and lozenges A historical reference to the cave is to be found in the Triads of Ireland, dating from the 14th to the 19th century, where \\", and \\" are listed under the heading, \\"the three darkest places in Ireland\\". The last, meaning the \\"Cave of the Alders,\\" is generally thought to be the present Dunmore Cave, while the first two translate as the caves of Knowth and the caves of Slaney. It is not known which exact system of caves/passage tombs near the river Slaney is being referred to, with the most likely, those at Baltinglass. Other sources translate the listed locations as Rath Croghan, the cave or crypt of Slane and the \\"Cave of the Ferns\\". The east-west orientation of the passages at Knowth suggests astronomical alignment with the equinoxes. The alignment at Knowth does not occur today. This is due to a number of factors. First of all, the passages were discovered by later settlers and were, to some extent, destroyed or incorporated into souterrains. In this way the original entrances to the passages were distorted or destroyed, making it difficult to establish if an alignment ever existed. Further, the recent excavations (1962 onwards) under George Eogan resulted in the erection of a concrete slab wall inside the mounds west entrance, restricting any investigation into the possible alignments. It seems likely that the passages were intended to align. Also, the alignments of ancient monuments can change due to Milankovitch cycles. A brief excavation of the site was carried out in 1941 by Macallister. However, major full-scale excavations began on the site in 1962 and were undertaken by George Eogan of University College Dublin. When his excavations began, very little was known about the full extent of the site. The entrances to the western and eastern passages were discovered in 1967 and 1968 respectively, and, slowly, the layers of activity at the site of Knowth were uncovered. The excavation has produced numerous books and reports on the findings. The archaeological excavation of Knowth East ended any chance of research on alignments when George Eogan erected a concrete wall across the east-passage entrance. The most extensive research on alignments and astronomy at Knowth was carried out by American-Irish researcher Martin Brennan.The Stars and the Stones was later re-published as The Stones of Time: Calendars, Sundials and Stone Chambers of Ancient Ireland, 1994 ; Access Access is by guided tour only. Tours begin at the Br√∫ na B√≥inne Visitor Centre in Donore. Visitors can look down the eastern passage and visit the nearby modern interpretive room.

It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage of draws than other main lines, but also a lower overall performance for Black. After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a in the with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong . The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the and tries to break through on the , while 6.Nc3 keeps the advantage of a pawn at the cost of a weakening of the white . Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure. The Budapest Gambit contains several specific strategic themes. After 3.dxe5 Ng4, there is a battle over White's extra pawn on e5, which Black typically attacks with ...Nc6 and (after ...Bc5 or ...Bb4+) ...Qe7, while White often defends it with Bf4, Nf3, and sometimes Qd5. In the 4.Nf3 variation the game can evolve either with Black attacking White's with manoeuvres of , or with White attacking Black's kingside with the push f2‚Äìf4, in which case Black reacts in the centre against the e3-pawn. In numerous variations the move c4‚Äìc5 allows White to gain space and to open prospects for his . For Black, the check Bf8‚Äìb4+ often allows rapid development. History In a Chess Notes feature article, Edward Winter showed that the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated.Edward Winter,The Budapest Defence, Chess Notes The first known game with the Budapest Gambit is Adler‚ÄìMar√≥czy (played in Budapest in 1896). This game already featured some key aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local experts who had witnessed the game. The Hungarians Istv√°n Abonyi, Zsigmond Bar√°sz and Gyula Breyer further developed the opening. Breyer played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser in a small tournament in Budapest. The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer in Vienna in 1917. Carl Schlechter published an optimistic analysis of the gambit in the Deutsche Schachzeitung.Tseitlin 1992, p.8Oleinikov 2005, chapter 3 Tartakower, a practitioner of the Budapest Gambit The first use of the opening against a world-class player was at Berlin in April 1918, a double round-robin tournament with four players: Akiba Rubinstein, Carl Schlechter, Jacques Mieses and Milan Vidmar. Vidmar had to play Black in the first round against Rubinstein, then ranked the fourth best player in the world with a very style. At a loss for what to play, he sought advice from his friend Abonyi, who showed him the Budapest Gambit and the main ideas the Hungarian players had found. Vidmar followed Abonyi's advice and beat Rubinstein convincingly in just 24 moves.Tseitlin 1992, p.7 This victory so heartened Vidmar that he went on to win the tournament, while Rubinstein was so demoralised by this defeat that he lost another game against Mieses and drew a third one against Schlechter in the same opening.Moskalenko 2007, p.9 After this tournament, the gambit finally began to be taken seriously. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. Schlechter published in 1918 the monograph Die budapester Verteidigung des Damengambits, which can be considered the first book on this opening. The gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920, so much so that many White players adopted the move-order 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 to avoid it.Oleinikov 2005, chapter 4Moskalenko 2007, p.28 The leading exponents of 1.d4 started to look for reliable antidotes. Alexander Alekhine showed how White could get a strong attack with 4.e4 in his games against Ilya Rabinovich (Baden-Baden 1925) and Adolf Seitz (Hastings 1925‚Äì26). But a few weeks later a on the Budapest Gambit was held, in Budapest, and the result was 14¬Ω‚Äì21¬Ω in Black's favour. Another tournament in Semmering the same year saw Alekhine losing to Karl Gilg in his pet line with White against the gambit, so that the e4-line had a mixed reputation. Meanwhile, more positional plans were also developed for White. Rubinstein showed how White could get a small positional advantage with 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2, an assessment still valid today. The possibility 6.Nc3 was also considered attractive, as structural weaknesses were not valued as much as a material advantage of one pawn in those days. By the end of the 1920s, despite the invention of the highly original Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 in 1928, the Budapest Gambit was considered theoretically dubious.Tseitlin 1992, p.9 This assessment was left unchanged for decades, as few players at the highest level used the Budapest Gambit and information about games from lesser players could not easily be found. During that time, various responses were developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by Istv√°n Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Dolfi Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies.White's plan involves pawn advances on the queenside, resulting in the creation of a weak pawn for Black, then winning this weak pawn. In this process all minor pieces and queenside pawns are likely to disappear, so that White ends up in a better ending with four pawns on the kingside against three for Black, and only major pieces. This type of ending has drawish tendencies, as Kaposztas demonstrated in his games against Meleghegyi (Budapest 1981), Petran (Budapest 1974) or Farago (Budapest 1975), all of them drawn. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7‚Äìd6 or f7‚Äìf6 and a quick attack against b2.Oleinikov 2005, chapter 6 The Budapest Gambit saw a short-lived revival in 1984‚Äì85 when Chess Informant included three games (as many as in the previous fifteen years), all played at a high level of competition, and all won by Black.Oleinikov 2005, chapter 7 But White players found reinforcements and even invented a line with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3.Oleinikov 2005, chapter 8 In the 21st century, despite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the Budapest Gambit almost never appears at the highest level.Oleinikov 2005, chapter 12Moskalenko 2007, p.10 Its most recent appearance was when Rich√°rd Rapport defeated Boris Gelfand with Black using the opening in round 2 of the 2014 Tata Steel Chess competition.For the game score, see this link. Performance In the database of the website ChessGames.com, the Budapest Gambit scores 28.9% Black wins, 44.1% White wins and 27.1% draws. The percentage of draws is especially low compared to mainstream alternatives such as 2...e6 (43.7% draws) or 2...g6 (37% draws). This opening gives more chance to win for both opponents, although the percentage of Black wins is still lower than the alternative 2...c5. In the main line 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 the percentage of Black wins already falls to 21.1%, lower than the main lines after 2...e6 or 2...g6. The Budapest Gambit has never been widely used as Black by the top-ten chessplayers. Richard R√©ti used it five times in the period 1919‚Äì26 when he was among the ten best players in the world, but he scored only 1¬Ω points. Savielly Tartakower used it four times in 1928 when he was the eighth-best player in the world, including thrice in one tournament (Bad Kissingen 1928) but he scored only ¬Ω point against world-class opposition: Bogoljubov then ranked number four in the world, Capablanca ranked number two, and Rubinstein ranked number seven. Rudolf Spielmann used it thrice in 1922‚Äì23 when he was about number 9‚Äì12 in the world, with a win against Euwe but defeats against Yates and S√§misch. Nigel Short played the gambit twice in the years 1992‚Äì93 when he was number 7‚Äì11, scoring only ¬Ω points against Karpov (then ranked number two) and Ivanchuk (then ranked number three). Recently, Mamedyarov used it twice in 2004 (scoring 1¬Ω with a win against Van Wely) when he was not already among the top-players, and six times in 2008 when he was about number 6‚Äì14; he scored five points with wins against former world champion Kramnik (then ranked number three), and grandmasters Tkachiev and Eljanov, but all six games took place in rapid or blitz events. Nicolas Giffard summarises the modern assessment of the Budapest Gambit: > [It is] an old opening, seldom used by champions without having fallen in > disgrace. While White has several methods to get a small advantage, this > defence is strategically sound. Black gets a good pawn structure and > possibilities of attack on the kingside. His problems generally come from > the white pressure on the d-column and a lack of space to manoeuvre his > pieces. Boris Avrukh writes, \\"The Budapest Gambit is almost a respectable opening; I doubt there is a refutation. Even in the lines where White manages to keep an extra pawn, Black always has a lot of play for it.\\" Strategic and tactical themesWhite builds up an imposing pawn centre= In the Alekhine variation White does not try to defend his e5-pawn and keep his material advantage, but instead he concentrates on building an imposing pawn centre. This brings him good prospects of a space advantage that may serve as a basis for a future attack on the kingside. However, the extended pawn centre has its drawbacks, as Lalic explains: \\"White must invest some valuable tempi in protecting his pawn structure, which allows Black to seize the best squares for his minor pieces with excellent prospects for counterplay against the white centre.\\"Lalic 1998, p.9 Hence in this variation Black lets White build his pawn centre only to undermine it later, a playing philosophy espoused in the teachings of the hypermodern school. The strategic themes are similar to the ones that can be found in other openings like the Four Pawns Attack, the Alekhine Defence or the Gr√ºnfeld Defence. =Budapest rook= The \\"Budapest rook\\" is a manoeuvre, introduced by the IM Dolfi Drimer in 1968,Moskalenko 2008, p.159 with which Black develops the a8 rook aggressively along the sixth rank using the moves a7‚Äìa5 and the Ra8‚Äìa6‚Äìh6.Lalic 1998, p.12 For example, this can happen in the Adler variation after the move sequence 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 Ngxe5 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 8.a3 a5 9.0-0 0-0 10.Nc3 Ra6 11.b3 Rh6. The rook is then used to support a piece attack against White's castled king.Lalic 1998, p.13 Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is facilitated by the absence of a white knight on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen). If White tries to defend with h2‚Äìh3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file. The Bc5 may not seem particularly useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 it makes it difficult for White to play f4 to chase away the black knight;Moskalenko 2008, p.162 furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8‚Äìh2 via Bc5‚Äìa7‚Äìb8, to apply still more pressure on h2. It can also stay on the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal to put pressure on f2, if White pushes e3‚Äìe4 at some stage. The \\"Budapest rook\\" was an invigorating innovation of the 1980s, and gave the gambit new life. However, inconveniences arise from delaying d7‚Äìd6 in order to allow the lift: the light-square bishop has to wait a long time to develop, and any attack on the Bc5 is potentially annoying for Black (since it means either closing the sixth rank with ...d6/...b6, abandoning the active a7‚Äìg1 diagonal, or blocking the rook when deployed to a7). This, in addition to the risk of awkwardness in the king side (a knight on f5 will fork the Rh6 and the Qh4) and the single- mindedness of Black's plan (with nothing to fall back on if the direct attack is repelled), has made some revisit the old lines, where it is instead the king's rook that is developed to h6. The queen's rook can then be retained on the queenside, and will be well-placed if the b-file opens as a result of Black's Bc5 being exchanged and recaptured with a b6 pawn. =Advantages of ...Bb4+= In most variations Black has the opportunity to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1‚Äìc3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending.Lalic 1998, p.10 On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation. If White is compelled to play Nb1‚Äìd2, it is sometimes a minuscule positional concession, as it makes it harder for this knight to reach its ideal square d5.Moskalenko 2008, p.51‚Äì52 However, if Black is later compelled to exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if White is forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1‚Äìc3‚Äìd5. For example, in the Alekhine variation, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6 6.Nf3, the move 6...Bb4+ (see diagram) is good because White has no good reply apart from 7.Nc3. Indeed, 7.Nbd2 just loses a pawn after 7...Nxf4 whereas 7.Bd2 Qe7 causes White great problems: both the pawn f4 and e4 pawns are attacked, and 8.Bxb4 Qxb4+ results in a double attack against b2 and f4.Tseitlin 1992, p.37 After 7.Nc3 Black can either answer with 7...Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 or with 7...Qf6, simultaneously attacking c3 and f4.Another example is in the game D√∂ry‚ÄìTartakower (Vienna 1928), when after the initial opening sequence 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e3 Nxe5 5.Nf3 the answer 5...Bb4+?! is bad because White can play 6.Nbd2 to avoid the exchange of bishops and gain a tempo later with a2‚Äìa3, with a small plus (see Tseitlin 1992, p.13). A third example is in the Adler variation after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 when Black should not play 4...Bb4+ because White can answer 5.Nbd2! Nc6 6.e3 Ngxe5 7.Nxe5 Nxe5 8.a3! Bxd2+ 9.Qxd2 and White has the better prospects. He has the bishop pair and he can develop his Bc1 on the influential a1‚Äìh8 diagonal (see Tseitlin 1992, p.69). =Pressure against the e4-square and the e3-pawn= Pressure against the e3-pawn In the Adler variation 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White has moved f2‚Äìf4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn on an open file. Black can then apply pressure on the e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this plan would include the manoeuvre Ne5‚Äìd7‚Äìf6, followed by putting the heavy pieces on the e-file with Rf8‚Äìe8 and Qd8‚Äìe7 (see diagram).Lalic 1998, p.81 The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square. This plan is viable only if certain conditions are met. The d7-square must be available for the Ne5, so that it can later transfer to f6. White should also not be able to easily advance the e3-pawn to e4, where it would be adequately defended by the Nc3 and a possible Bf3. Finally, White should not have the time to launch a quick attack on Black's castled position with the pawn thrust f4‚Äìf5‚Äìf6. =Breakthrough with the c4‚Äìc5 push= In the main lines the pawn push c4‚Äìc5 often brings positional gains to White. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram) White gets the bishop pair and a space advantage. In order to build up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a on the queenside, with the goal of performing the pawn advance c4‚Äìc5 in favourable conditions.Moskalenko 2008, p.54 This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the prospects of the , it creates a half-open file to attack with the rooks, and it creates an isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6. For example, in the adjacent diagram, after the natural but mistaken 10...0-0?! White can immediately realise his strategic goal with 11.c5!Lalic 1998, p.32 Then if Black accepts the temporary sacrifice after 11...Qxc5 12.Rc1 Qd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 14.Rd1 White gets his pawn back and has created a weak pawn in d7, while if Black declines the pawn he has difficulties in developing his queenside (for example 11...d6 might be followed by 12.cxd6 Qxd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 and the pawn on d6 is weak). Therefore, Black generally tries to hinder the c4‚Äìc5 push with moves like d7‚Äìd6, b7‚Äìb6 or Rf8‚Äìd8 (if this creates a hidden vis-√†-vis between the Rd8 and the Qd2). Similarly, in the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3, after 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 White is saddled with doubled pawns in c3 and c4 that limit the scope of his bishop pair. Hence the push c4‚Äìc5 can be used to free the light-squared bishop and disrupt Black's position.Lalic 1998, p.10 In the Adler variation 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after 4...Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.b3 a5 10.Bb2 Nxf3+ Bxf3 Ne5 12.Be2 Ra6 13.Qd5 Qe7 14.Ne4 Ba7 White has good reasons to push 15.c5.Borik 1986, p.17 Akesson‚ÄìTagnon, Berlin open 1984 This move would close the diagonal of the Ba7. It would make it harder for Black to develop the Bc8 as pawn pushes like b7‚Äìb6 or d7‚Äìd6 may be answered respectively by cxb6 or cxd6, creating a weak pawn for Black. Also, the prospects of the Be2 would be enhanced. =Kieninger Trap= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3 Ngxe5 8.axb4 Nd3 The Kieninger Trap is named after Georg Kieninger who used it in an offhand game against Godai at Vienna in 1925.Borik 1986, p.24 It occurs in the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3. The Bb4 is attacked but Black does not have to move it for the moment, and instead both regains the gambit pawn and sets a with 7...Ngxe5 (see diagram). Superficially, White seems to win a piece with 8.axb4, but that would be falling into the Kieninger Trap because it would allow 8...Nd3 mate. ChessBase contains 76 games where white has lost this way; even after the exchange 8.Nxe5 Nxe5, the threat of ...Nd3 mate remains and indirectly defends the Bb4 from capture. A rare variant has also occurred in a in the Fajarowicz variation, after the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 4.Qc2 Bb4+ 5.Nd2 d5 6.exd6 Bf5 7.Qa4+ Nc6 8.a3 Nc5 9.dxc7 Qe7! when White, trying to save his queen, fell into 10.Qd1 Nd3 mate.Borik 1986, p.82 Lhaghkva‚ÄìContendini, Leipzig Olympiad, 1960 Adler variation 3...Ng4 4.Nf3 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 The Adler variation is named after the game Adler‚ÄìMar√≥czy, played at the 1896 Budapest tournament.Oleinikov chapter 5 White is ready to return the e5-pawn in order to develop his pieces on their best squares, i.e. the d5-square for the Nb1, the f3-square for the Ng1 and the a1‚Äìh8 diagonal for the Bc1. Black can try the minor line 4...Nc6 that delays the development of its , to develop it along the a1‚Äìh8 diagonal instead of the a3‚Äìf8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:Tseitlin 1992, p.70 > At first sight the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the > pawn on e3, and is insecure in view of the threat to exchange it by > Nc3‚Äìa4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic > significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming > the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight > outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to > the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or > even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6. An important theoretical decision for White is to choose whether to play a2‚Äìa3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2‚Äìb4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8‚Äìa6‚Äìh6. As Lalic puts it: > It was not so long ago that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding > with b2‚Äìb4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the > logical a7‚Äìa5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion > of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook > access into play via the a6-square. =Line 4...Bc5 with a2‚Äìa3= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 6.a3 The opinion of the move 6.a3 has gradually shifted from being the main continuation to being a possible continuation, then down to its present status of being considered a mistake. The threat to push b2‚Äìb4 must be taken seriously by Black, who typically answers 6...a5. But in the 1980s it was discovered that the push a7‚Äìa5 was actually a very useful one for Black, as it allows the Ra8 to be developed along the sixth rank. Meanwhile, the push a2‚Äìa3 is less useful for White, as he will not be able to easily push b2‚Äìb4. As Tseitlin puts it, \\"the point is that 6...a5 fits into the plan of attacking White's kingside, whereas 6.a3 does little in the way of defending it\\".Tseitlin 1992, p.83 Thus if White does not find a clear way to make good use of his move a2‚Äìa3, it may turn out to be a critical waste of tempo.Tseitlin 1992, p.87Silman 2002 After the topical moves 7.b3 0-0 8.Bb2 Re8 9.Nc3 Ngxe5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Be2 Black has regained the invested pawn. White has a space advantage in the centre and can initiate pressure here or on the queenside by pawn pushes like b3‚Äìb4 and c4‚Äìc5 (possibly supported by a knight on the d5-square). Meanwhile, the white king lacks defenders so Black can start a pieces-driven attack with the 11...Ra6 (see section \\"Budapest rook\\"). The stem game continued with 12.Nd5 Rh6 13.Bd4 d6 14.Ra2 Bf5 15.Bxc5 dxc5 and Black won in 26 moves.Tseitlin 1992, p.87 To avoid such an unfavourable development, White players have changed the move-order to keep the Bc1 on its original square as long as possible, so that it can help the defence. Thus, the typical move-order became 7.b3 0-0 8.Nc3 Re8 9.Be2 Ngxe5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.0-0 when 11...Ra6 would be met with 12.Nd5 Rh6 13.e4 immediately attacking the maveric rook. So Black usually opts for 11...d6, forgetting about the Ra8‚Äìa6‚Äìh6 manoeuvre. After 12.Bb2 ECO considers the situation as favourable to White, but Tseitlin thinks Black still has a lot of possibilities (e.g. the other rook lift Re8‚Äìe6‚Äìh6), so that \\"the struggle still lies ahead\\".Tseitlin 1992, p.88 =Line 4...Bc5 without a2‚Äìa3= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Nf3 Bc5 5.e3 Nc6 By refraining from the advance a2-a3 White tries to gain a tempo on the lines of the previous section, making it more difficult for Black to initiate the Re8‚Äìe6‚Äìh6 or Ra8‚Äìa6‚Äìh6 lifts. After the moves 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 White has tried two different plans. The older one sees White attack in the centre with moves like b2‚Äìb3, Bc1‚Äìb2, Qd1‚Äìd5, Nc3‚Äìe4 and c4‚Äìc5. White gets an important space advantage in the centre, but Black can attack the kingside with rook lifts. After 10.b3 a5 White can try to capture the Bc5 with 11.Na4 or 11.Ne4, one point being that the retreat 11...Ba7 would lock the Ra8 because Black has not played Ra8‚Äìa6 already. Lalic still thinks 11...Ba7 is the right move after 11.Ne4 due to the importance of the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal, but Black can also reroute the bishop with 11...Bf8 and \\"White has no obvious path to even a minute advantage\\".Lalic 1998, p.79 After 11.Na4 Black can also simply react by 11...b6 when the loss of the bishop pair is compensated by the semi-open b-file and improved control of the central squares.Borik 1986, p.19 Tseitlin considers that after the exchange on c5 Black has the better position.Tseitlin 1992, p.78 Hence the main continuation is 11.Bb2, keeping the knight jumps for later. Then the most common plan for Black is a rook lift: the plan Ra8‚Äìa6‚Äìh6 was tried in the much-commented game √Ökesson‚ÄìTagnon (Berlin Open 1984). Black duly won, but after the game continuation 11...Ra6 12.Qd5! Qe7 13.Ne4 Ba7 14.c5 Rg6 15.Rac1 Bb8 16.f4 authors do not agree on which side had the advantage. Borik and Tseitlin both consider White to have a positional advantage, with Tseitlin recommending instead 15...Nc6!, with dangerous threats.Borik 1986, p.17Tseitlin 1992, p.80 However Lalic writes of 15...Bb8, \\"it is true that the bishop pair looks a bit pathetic lined up on the back rank just now, but there is no way to stop them breaking out later\\".Lalic 1998, p.76 The second plan for White, unveiled by Spassky in 1990, aims at a kingside blitzkrieg with moves like Kg1‚Äìh1, f2‚Äìf4, Be2‚Äìd3 and Qd1‚Äìh5. In the original game Black did not fathom White's idea, so that after 10.Kh1 a5?! 11.f4 Nc6 12.Bd3 d6 13.Qh5! h6 14.Rf3 Black's pieces were ill- placed to counter White's attack.Tseitlin 1992, p.132 A more principled plan for Black is to react in the centre, specifically targeting the backward e3-pawn and e4-square. After 10.Kh1 d6 11.f4 Nd7! 12.Bd3 Nf6 13.Qf3 Ng4 14.Nd1 f5! and Black has succeeded in inhibiting White's e3‚Äìe4 expansion .Lalic 1998, p.81 Alekseev‚ÄìBliumberg, Minsk 1993 As Black was doing fine with the 11.f4 move- order, White has been searching for a new path with 10.Kh1 d6 11.Na4 b6! 12.Bd2 a5 13.Nxc5 bxc5 14.f4 Nd7 15.Bf3 when Jeremy Silman prefers White.Silman 2002 White has even dared the immediate 10.f4 Nc6 11.Bd3 when it is extremely dangerous for Black to take the offered e3-pawn, as White gets a fierce kingside attack for free. Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 This move sequence is called the \\"Rubinstein variation\\" in reference to the famous game Rubinstein‚ÄìVidmar (Berlin 1918) when 4.Bf4 was first employed.Moskalenko 2007, p.15 Various authors consider this move to be the most dangerous for Black. It aims to answer 4...Bc5 with 5.e3 without blocking the Bc1, contrary to what happens in the Adler variation 4.Nf3. Another point is that in the Adler variation White faces the risk of a strong attack against his kingside (see section \\"Budapest rook\\"), while in the 4.Bf4 variation this is seldom the case because the Bf4 is well placed to protect White's kingside. On the other hand, the early development of the bishop means that White is more vulnerable to the check Bf8‚Äìb4+, the b2-pawn is not defended, and in some rare cases the Bf4 can become subject to attack. Apart from the sideline 4...g5, the main line continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns in return for a material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2 Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.Tseitlin 1992, p.126 =Sideline 4...g5= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 g5 The sideline 4...g5!? was not well regarded at the end of the 20th century.Borik wrote that \\"the move 4...g5 creates irreparable weaknesses in Black's camp\\" (see Borik 1986, p.22), while Tseitlin decided \\"this extravagant tactical stroke weakens the kingside and, on general grounds alone, cannot be good\\" (see Tseitlin 1992, p.41). Lalic warned that \\"Black should be aware of the risks he is taking by playing such a line\\" (see Lalic 1998, p.65). It weakens several squares‚Äîparticularly f5 and h5‚Äîas they cannot be covered by the g-pawn any more. White can try to exploit these weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4‚Äìd2‚Äìc3 (pressure along the diagonal a1‚Äìh8), Ng1‚Äìe2‚Äìg3‚Äìh5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2‚Äìh4 (to open the h-file). Nonetheless, the 4...g5 line has found new supporters in recent years thanks to black wins against both 5.Bg3 and 5.Bd2. For years, the reaction 5.Bg3 was not well considered, because the retreat does not make the most out of Black's provocative fourth move; as Tseitlin points out, \\"the bishop is in danger of staying out of play for a long time\\".Tseitlin 1992, p.41 But later Lalic found that 5.Bg3 was \\"just as effective\\" as 5.Bd2.Lalic 1998, p.65 Black concentrates on capturing the e5-pawn while White tries to get an advantage from the weakening of the black kingside. After the typical moves 5...Bg7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nc3 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 d6 Lalic considers the best try to be 10.c5!, sacrificing a pawn to weaken Black's control on the e5-square and expose the black king further. White has also tried to quickly open the h-file with 7.h4 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 but after 9...g4! Black succeeds in keeping the file closed.Lalic 1998, p.67 Amura - Paglilla, Buenos Aires open 1995 The alternative to 5.Bg3 is 5.Bd2 to place the bishop on the wide-open diagonal a1‚Äìh8, after which \\"White can expect a safe advantage\\". Then according to Lalic, delaying the recapture with 5...Bg7 6.Bc3 Nc6 7.e3 Ngxe5 is not correct as White can gain an advantage by 8.h4 or 8.Qh5,Lalic 1998, p.66 Kuraszkiewicz‚ÄìBartsch, Germany 1996 so the immediate 5...Nxe5 is better. For some time 6.Bc3 was well considered because Black had problems dealing with various positional threats, but the correct way for Black was found in 5...Nxe5 6.Bc3 Qe7 7.e3 Rg8! 8.Nf3 Nbc6 9.Be2 d6 10.Nd4 Bd7 11.b4 g4 with good counterplay for Black on the kingside.Lalic 1998, p.66 Elbilia‚ÄìBartsch, Cannes open 1995 White's efforts then switched to 6.Nf3 to open the e-file, something that Black cannot really avoid, as 6...Bg7 7.Nxe5 Bxe5 8.Bc3 would leave an advantage to White. For example, 8...Qe7 9.Bxe5 Qxe5 10.Nc3 d6 11.e3 and Black is at a loss for an equalising line,Tseitlin 1992, p.47 White's advantage consisting in his ability to install his knight on the strong d5-square and to attack the weakened Black's kingside with the advance h2‚Äìh4. It is better for Black to continue with 6...Nxf3+ 7.exf3 when both 7...h5? and 7...Bg7 would fail to 8.Qe2+, so Black must try 7...d6 8.Qe2+ Be6 instead. =Line 6.Nc3= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3 This is the only important line in the Budapest where Black is not ensured of regaining his sacrificed pawn. Black does best to immediately exchange the Nc3 with 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 as otherwise White gets a small positional advantage simply by avoiding the doubled pawns (see the section \\"Advantages of ...Bb4+\\").Lalic 1998, p.51 Tseitlin 1992, p.49 Then Black can put pressure on the e5-pawn with 7...Qe7 when White's only possibility to keep the pawn is 8.Qd5. White threatens to ease the pressure with the move h2‚Äìh3 that would force the Ng4 to the unfavourable square h6, so Black's only possibilities to sustain the initiative are 8...Qa3 and 8...f6. The line 8...Qa3 puts pressure on the white queenside pawns, pressure that may later be intensified with Nf6‚Äìe4. The black queen also gains access to the a5-square, from where it puts pressure on the e1‚Äìa5 diagonal aimed towards the white king. After 9.Rc1 f6 10.exf6 Nxf6 11.Qd2 d6 12.Nd4 0-0 we reach the position of the famous game between Rubinstein and Vidmar, when Rubinstein erred with 13.e3? and later lost.Tseitlin 1992, p.7 After the better 13.f3 the correct method for Black is to target the c4-pawn with the regrouping Ne5/Qc5.Tseitlin 1992, p.55 Hence Lalic thinks 11.Qd2 is inappropriate and gives Black excellent counterplay, and prefers 11.Qd3 or even 11.Qd1!? After 11.Qd3 0-0 12.g3 d6 13.Bg2 Black should switch to a materialistic mode with 13...Qxa2.Lalic 1998, p.55 Yakovich‚ÄìCoret, Seville 1992 In the other line 8...f6 Black does not want to decentralise his queen and prefers to concentrate on active piece play in the centre. After 9.exf6 Nxf6, 10.Qd1, 10.Qd2 and 10.Qd3 are all possible, but each has its drawbacks: on d1 the queen is not developed, on d3 it is exposed to Bc8‚Äìf5 and on d2 it is exposed to Nf6‚Äìe4. Lalic considers 10.Qd3 to be the main move, qualifies 10.Qd1 as a \\"respectable option\\", but considers 10.Qd2 as \\"inaccurate\\". Meanwhile, Black will try to create counterplay by attacking either the weak c4-pawn, or the kingside with g7‚Äìg5 and h7‚Äìh5. In both cases a key possibility is the move Nf6‚Äìe4 that centralises the knight, attacks the weak c3-pawn, controls the c5-square and supports the g7‚Äìg5 thrust. =Line 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3=On the way till 10...d6 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3 The Bb4 is attacked but Black can play 7...Ngxe5 to get the gambitted pawn back, as 8.axb4?? would allow the Kieninger trap 8...Nd3 mate (see the section \\"Kieninger trap\\"). Now White is more or less forced to exchange a pair of knights with 8.Nxe5 Nxe5.Black threatens both the c4-pawn and the Nf3, and 8.e3?! Nxf3+ forces either 9.gxf3 with doubled pawns or 9.Qxf3 Bxd2+ 10.Kxd2, when White cannot castle any more. White does not want to play 8.Bxe5?! either because it would cede the bishop pair, which is the main source of White's hopes for an advantage in this line. White still cannot win a piece with 9.axb4?? Nd3# or 9.Bxe5?! Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 Qxe5, so he usually plays 9.e3 in order to protect the c4-pawn and defuse the mating threat, so that now Black is obliged to move his Bb4. As 9...Bd6 would misplace the bishop and 9...Ba5?? would lose the bishop to 10.b4 Bb6 11.c5, Black usually plays 9...Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2.Note that for Black, the sequence 7...Ngxe5 8...Nxe5 9...Bxd2+ is not only cunning, but also the best move-order as another sequence would give White an early opportunity to realise the advantageous c4‚Äìc5 push (whose advantages are explained in the section \\"Breakthrough with the c4‚Äìc5 push\\"). For example after 7...Bxd2+?! 8.Qxd2 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 White should not play the usual 10.e3?! but should strive for more with the immediate 10.c5! as Black cannot take in c5 without losing the c7-pawn because of the possibilities Ra1‚Äìc1 and Qd2‚Äìc3 (see Lalic 1998, p.33). After 10.Qxd2, Tseitlin explains that \\"opening manuals assess this position as favourable to White on the basis of the bishop pair. However, considering the closed nature of the position, White faces substantial difficulties in the realisation of this nominal advantage.\\"Tseitlin 1992, p.63 Black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp, but can put up a lot of resistance thanks to small assets. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. Moreover, exchanging the knight with Bxe5 is not appealing for White, since that would mean losing the advantage of the bishop pair. Also, the Bc8 can sometimes become better than its counterpart the Bf1, if it makes it to the good squares b7 or c6 while the Bf1 remains restricted by the Ne5. This explains the most natural plans for both sides. White will try a on the queenside, in order to increase its space advantage and to create some weaknesses in the black pawns (e.g. an isolated pawn or a backward pawn). So White will try to use the advances b2‚Äìb4 or c4‚Äìc5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black will try to keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is in order to keep the Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7‚Äìb6 and d7‚Äìd6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5‚Äìd7‚Äìf8‚Äìe6. The first move by Black has to be 10...d6! because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example, 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already. International Master Timothy Taylor has suggested an alternative for Black on move 9. He regards 9...Bxd2+ as inferior, arguing that \\"the strong black bishop is traded for the inoffensive knight, and white gets the long-term advantage of the two bishops in a semi-open game\\".Taylor 2009, p.161. Taylor instead advocates 9...Bc5, when Black stands well after 10.b4 Bd4! (11.exd4?? Nd3#) 11.Rb1 d6 12.Be2 Bf5 13.Rb3 Ng6 14.Bg3 (14.exd4 Nxf4 15.Re3? Nxg2+ wins; 14.Bxd6 cxd6 15.exd4 Nf4 16.g3 Bc2! wins material) Bf6; 10.Ne4 Ng6; 10.Nb3 Bd6; or 10.Be2 d6.Taylor 2009,pp.164‚Äì67 Battle for the push c4‚Äìc5 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3 Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 d6 After 10...d6! White can try (and has tried) about any move that supports the aforementioned plan. In particular, White has to choose if he wants to start active operations on the queenside immediately (e.g. Rc1, Qc3, c5), or if he wants to finish his development first (with Be2 and 0-0). The immediate 11.c5!? is a possible pawn sacrifice in order to open some diagonals for the bishops. As Lalic points out, \\"after 11...dxc5 Black's knight on e5 has lost its support and therefore all tactical motifs based on Qd5 and Bb5+ must be carefully checked\\".Lalic 1998, p.36 White gets a powerful attack for his pawn but nothing decisive. The same idea can be tried with the preparatory 11.Rc1, and after 11...0-0 12.c5!? dxc5 13.Qd5 Ng6 14.Bg3 White should be reminded that he has not finished his development with 14...Qf6! and a counter-attack on the b2-pawn.Tseitlin 1992, p.64Lalic 1998, p.37 Playing Black, Svidler chose a different path with 11...b6 but his opponent Lesi√®ge nevertheless sacrificed the pawn with 12.c5! bxc5 13.b4 0-0 14.bxc5 Bb7 15.f3 and Svilder chose to destroy his own pawn structure with 15...dxc5!? to activate his pieces and make use of the d-file.Lalic 1998, p.38 The most popular move is 11.Be2, where White delays his queenside play until he has achieved castling.Lalic 1998, p.38 It also gives Black more time to organise a defence on the queenside with b7‚Äìb6, either now or after 11...0-0. =Line 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.e3= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.Bf4 Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.e3 In this variation White tries to avoid the move a2‚Äìa3 in order to gain a tempo over the 7.a3 variation. After the standard moves 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.Be2 followed by 10.0-0 it is Black's last chance to exchange the Bb4 for the Nd2. The game will take an entirely different structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it. Lalic thinks the strategies in which Black gives up the bishop pair (by exchanging its Bb4 for the Nd2) for nothing are a mistake. He does not like the strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 either, because they are too drawish. He recommends the strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and maintain its position there with the help of the a7‚Äìa5 pawn advance.Lalic 1998, p.30 Black gives up the bishop pair When Black opts for 10...Bxd2, he runs the risk to end up a tempo down over the 7.a3 variation and to be soon unable to meet White's positional threats on the queenside. White can avoid the push a2‚Äìa3 and continue with the standard plans of the 7.a3 variation.Borik 1986, p.24 However, everything is not that bad for Black. First, to implement his plan White has to concentrate on development (9.Be2, 10.0-0) before he turns his attention to the queenside. That means Black has more time to organise his play than in the 7.a3 variation, notably to attempt a blockade of the c5-square. Moreover, as White does not put immediate pressure on Black's position, Black is not compelled to castle rapidly and he can keep his king in the centre for a longer time, or even castle queenside. Hence Lalic note that \\"White has not wasted time with a2‚Äìa3, but in fact it is not so easy to capitalise on this extra tempo.\\"Lalic 1998, p.17 A possibility for Black is to develop his light-square bishop rapidly, by prioritising the moves b7‚Äìb6 and Bc8‚Äìb7 over castling and d7‚Äìd6. The game Solozhenkin‚ÄìStiazhkin (Leningrad 1990) continued with 9...b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 12.c5 bxc5 13.Qa5 d6 14.Bxe5 dxe5 15.Rfc1 and Moskalenko assesses this position as better for White;Moskalenko 2007, p.69 Lalic suggests that 13...Ng6 is an improvement.Lalic 1998, p.18 In the game Gausel‚ÄìReite (Norwegian Team Championship 1991), after the same 9.Be2 b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 Black introduced a highly original plan by avoiding the natural advance d7‚Äìd6, and instead blocked a white c5-push by playing ...c5 himself. The game continued 12.Qc3 f6 13.b4 c5!? and Lalic was \\"deeply impressed by this plan, which really spoils all of White's fun\\". The c4-pawn is never allowed to advance, so that the Be2 is durably restricted. The Bf4 is obstructed by the Ne5, that cannot be easily removed. The weakness of the d7-pawn is not a worry as it can be protected by Bb7‚Äìc6 if necessary. Black keeps the bishop pair After 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Black can avoid the immediate exchange of his Bb4 against the Nd2 in several ways. The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmaster Pavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This can be achieved via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and should be able to gradually equalize.Taylor 2009, p.154 The other possibility for Black is to keep his Bb4 as long as possible, exchanging it against the white knight only in favourable circumstances. A couple of attempts have been done with this in mind, with subtle variations along the moves a7‚Äìa5, b7‚Äìb6 and d7‚Äìd6. Against the mundane 10...d6 White can continue with 11.Nb3 (see diagram) to play on the queenside against the exposed Bb4, or 11.Nb1 to recycle the knight on the ideal d5-square. Another idea is the immediate 10...a5, to have the d6-square for the bishop, inhibit the b2‚Äìb4 push and have the possible a5‚Äìa4 pawn advance if the white knight moves to b3. In the game Mikhalevski‚ÄìChabanon (Bad Endbach 1995) Black kept the bishop with 11.Nb3 a4 12.a3 Bd6 13.Nd4 Bc5 14.Nb5 d6 15.Nc3 Ng6 16.Bg3 f5 and had dynamic play.Lalic 1998, p.27 =Gambits 5.Nbd2 d6 and 6.Nbd2 f6= With 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 d6 (see diagram) Black wants to open the diagonal a1‚Äìh8 for his queen. After 6.exd6 Qf6 White can react to the attack on his Bf4 in several ways, the best one being 7.Nh3 to develop a piece and protect both the Bf4 and the f2-pawn. It also helps that the Bf4 is still guarding the Nd2, so that after 7...Qxb2? there is not the threat of winning the exchange (8...Bxd2+ would be answered by 9.Bxd2) and White can repel Black's attack with 8.Rb1 Qa3 9.Rb3 Qa5 10.dxc7 Nc6 11.a3! Be7 12.e3.Lalic 1998, p.61 Gleizerov‚ÄìRitova, Berlin 1996 Instead, Black must play energetically with 7...Nxf2 8.Kxf2 Bxh3 9.g3 Bxf1 10.dxc7!? Nc6 11.Rxf1 and here Lalic recommends 11...0-0 12.Kg2 Rfe8.Lalic 1998, p.61 Sher‚ÄìMohr, Ljubljana 1995 Dumitrache‚ÄìBiti, Zagreb 1997 The other gambit, 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 f6 7.exf6 Qxf6, is much riskier, as Black weakens his kingside and does not open a diagonal for his Bc8. Black tries to take advantage of the fact White has moved his dark-squared bishop away from the queenside, leaving the b2-pawn without protection. The correct plan for White was shown by Gleizerov who played 8.e3 Qxb2 9.Be2 d6 10.0-0 0-0 11.Nb3 Qf6 12.c5! to open the a2‚Äìg8 diagonal that was weakened precisely by the gambit move 6...f6. The move 11.Nb3 is not only useful to support the c4‚Äìc5 push, but also to exchange the knight against Black's dark-squared bishop after a possible a2‚Äìa3 forcing the retreat Bb4‚Äìc5.Lalic 1998, p.47 Gleizerov‚ÄìBosch, Cappelle La Grande open 1996 As Lalic puts it, \\"I doubt if Black has a satisfactory answer to White's play in this game\\".Lalic 1998, p.49 Alekhine variation 3...Ng4 4.e4 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 This variation is named after Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine‚ÄìRabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine‚ÄìSeitz (Hastings, 1926).Oleinikov chapter 4As cited by Tseitlin (p.21), Alekhine himself stated: > This is considered with good reason to be White's best system against the > Budapest Gambit. White hands the pawn back, but in return gains control of > d5. Over the next few moves, however, he has to play with extreme precision, > since otherwise his central pawn position may become the object of a > successful attack by Black. White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn centre and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8‚Äìb4‚Äìxc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ to be a bad move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3,Lalic 1998, p.105 but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Be3.Lalic 1998, p.111 After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe5 5.f4 when Black has an important choice to make about where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best,Borik 1986, p.47, citing the IMs Harry Schl√ºsser and Tom Wedberg while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.Borik 1986, p.46 Taylor considers 4...Nxe5 inferior, recommending instead a rarely played idea of Richard R√©ti, 4...h5! (Taylor's exclamation point). Then 5.Nf3 would allow 5...Bc5, while Taylor suggests meeting 5.Be2 with 5...Nc6! and 5.f4 with 5...Bc5 with quick development compensating for the lost pawn. He considers the main line to be 4...h5 5.h3 Nxe5 6.Be3 Bb4+, with good play for Black.Taylor 2009, p.? =Line 5...Nec6= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 The knight on c6 is safer than on g6, and is well-placed as part of a general strategy to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters.Borik 1986, p.47 As Lalic points out:Lalic 1998, p.104 > White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other > way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine > the white centre. To this end Bc8‚Äìg4 often comes in handy, in order to pin > the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait > until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2. The main continuation 6.Be3 controls the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal and is considered to be the best reply.Lalic 1998, p.110 If Black wants to contest the c5-square for his Bf8 he can try 6...Na6,Tseitlin 1992, p.118 but most games continue with 6...Bb4+. Here the best reply for White is controversial.While Borik does not express a preference, Alekhine considers 7.Nc3! is \\"much stronger than 7.Nd2, for with the knight threatening to jump to d5, Black will sooner or later be forced to exchange his important dark- squared bishop for it. The doubling of the c-pawns in these circumstances is not something White should fear.\\" Tseitlin agrees, stating that \\"after 7.Nd2 Black has no difficulty at all\\" (see Tseitlin 1992, pp.31 & 119). On the other hand, Lalic thinks 7.Nd2! is more accurate as \\"White avoids the doubled c-pawns that are likely to occur after 7.Nc3, and this knight can later be deployed via the b3-square\\" (see Lalic 1998, p.111). After 7.Nc3 Black has the zwischenzug 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so that the diagonal a8‚Äìh1 is weakened before Black develops the Bc8 to the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as most of Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7‚Äìf5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925.Borik 1986, p.51; Tseitlin 1992, p.119 So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/0-0-0.Borik 1986, p.53 In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7‚Äìd6 should be avoided if Black has to respond to the capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would have too much leeway.Tseitlin 1992, p.33 After 7.Nd2 Qe7 8.a3 Lalic considers 8...Qxe4 should be avoided, e.g. the continuation 9.Kf2 Bxd2 10.Qxd2 0-0 11.Nf3 d6 12.Re1 gives White several tempi against the black queen.Lalic 1998, p.112 Potocnik‚ÄìG.Hofmann, Bled 1996 After the better 8...Bc5 9.Bxc5 Qxc5 10.Qf3 Lalic recommends 10...a5.Lalic 1998, p.112 The introduction of the intermediate 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Qe7 does not change Lalic's opinion, as after 9.Bg2 Na6 10.a3 Bc5 11.Bxc5 Nxc5 12.b4 Ne6 the bishop was well placed on g2 and Black experienced difficulties developing the Bc8.Lalic 1998, p.111 Dautov - Haas, Buehl 1992 But Lalic does not mention the game Pomar‚ÄìHeidenfeld cited by Borik, in which Black played the advance a7‚Äìa5 to restrict the white advance b2‚Äìb4, and achieved equality after 9.Bg2 a5 10.Ne2 Na6.Borik 1986, p.50 Moskalenko 2008, p.136 Pomar‚ÄìHeidenfeld, Enschede 1963 Instead, he recommends 7...d6 8.Nf3 0-0 9.Bd3 and now the same development as in Pomar's game:Lalic 1998, p.113 > 9...a5 and 10...Na6 deserves attention, when White's movements on the > queenside are more restricted and the black knight will be able to settle on > the c5-square without being kicked by the thematic b2‚Äìb4. It may appear that > we have reached the same position elaborated in previous games a tempo down > for Black, since he has committed his bishop to b4 and will later drop back > to the c5-square instead of heading there at once. However, the white knight > is less actively placed on d2 and in fact this fully compensates Black for > the slight loss of time. =Line 5...Ng6= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6 The knight on g6 puts the f4-pawn under pressure, but may be embarrassed later by the pawn thrust f4‚Äìf5. Now 6.a3, an attempt to deny squares from the Bf8 by continuing with b2‚Äìb4 or Bc1‚Äìe3, does not achieve its goal after 6...Bc5! 7.b4?! Bxg1! 8.Rxg1 0-0! 9.Qf3 d6 10.g4 a5 11.b5 Nd7 12.Ra2 Nc5 when Black's superior pawn structure and well-positioned Nc5 gives him the advantage.Lalic 1998, p.123 Mechkarov‚ÄìAtanasov, correspondence 1955 That leaves White with the choice between 6.Nf3 and 6.Be3. The move 6.Nf3 controls the e5-square in order to prepare the push f4‚Äìf5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White does not have to fear 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight is already in danger of being lost to Qd1‚Äìg4 or Qd1‚Äìh5.Borik 1986, p.43; Tseitlin 1992, p.120 Borik wrongly attributes the black pieces to Seitz in his book, while Tseitlin and Lalic rightly note the Black player was actually Rabinovich. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn.Borik 1986, p.45 Chebotayev‚ÄìIsayev, USSR 1948 One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.Tseitlin 1992, p.39 The move 6.Be3 takes the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal from Black's Bf8 and may in some lines prepare the long castle. After the mandatory 6...Bb4+ White can opt for 7.Nd2 to avoid having doubled pawns, but he must be prepared to sacrifice a pawn after 7...Qe7 8.Kf2!? Bxd2 9.Qxd2 Qxe4 10.Bd3 with piece activity for the pawn deficit,Lalic 1998, p.120 because the normal defence 8.Bd3? runs into 8...Qd6! and both the Bd3 and the f4-pawn are attacked.Lalic 1998, p.120 Lorscheid‚ÄìDunnington White does not need, however, bother too much about the doubled pawns and after 7.Nc3 Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 a peaceful black player might choose the quiet 8...b6!? followed by a normal development with d6/0-0/Bb7/Nd7/Re8/Nc5. Instead of 8...b6 a more adventurous black player could choose 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 f5!? as indicated by Borik, Tseitlin and Lalic,Tseitlin 1992, p.36Lalic 1998, p.122 but in his more recent book Moskalenko thinks \\"this move complicates the game too much\\".Moskalenko 2008, p.126 Golichenko‚ÄìMalienko, Kiev 2007 If the black player is neither peaceful nor aggressive, Lalic proposes an alternative with 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 0-0 10.Qd2 and only now that Black has his king safe shall he unleash 10...f5!?, when \\"it is not so easy for White to meet [10...f5] as the two main responses, 11.e5 and 11.exf5, allow Black promising chances with 11...d6 and 11...Nxf4 respectively\\". Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4 The Fajarowicz variation is said to have its origins in the chess circles from Leipzig, with the first important game being H.Steiner‚ÄìFajarowicz at the 1928 Wiesbaden tournament.Borik 1986, p.60Tseitlin 1992, p.89 In this variation, Black makes no immediate effort to regain the gambit pawn, preferring to concentrate on active piece play and tactical tricks.These tactical pitfalls include notably a Bb4+ at an annoying moment, a Qf6 with a double attack on b2 and f2, (after 1...d6 2.exd6 Bxd6) the pseudo-sacrifice 3...Nxf2 4.Kxf2 Bg3+ and 5...Qxd1 winning White's queen for two minor pieces, and a concerted attack on the d3 square with the setup Nc5/Bf5/Nb4 (once White has played e3). The move 4.a3 allows White to avoid the annoying bishop check on b4, the also annoying knight jump to b4, and prepares Qc2 to undermine Black's knight. Both Lalic and de Firmian consider it to be White's best move,Lalic calls it \\"undoubtedly the most critical line\\". Lalic 1998, p.132 with de Firmian assessing it as leading to a large advantage for White. Lalic considers 4...b6!? to be the best answer, one point being that Qd1‚Äìc2, so effective in most of the other lines, can be met by Bc8‚Äìb7. After 5.Nd2 Bb7 6.Qc2 Lalic gives 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 a5! when the black bishops will be excellently placed on the b7- and c5-squares.Lalic 1998, p.139 Lalic recommends 6.Nf3 instead,Lalic 1998, p.139 Ricardi‚ÄìPerez, Olivos 1993 while de Firmian continues by 5.Nf3 Bb7 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.Qc2 with a large advantage for White. The move 4.Nf3 develops a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily get confused by the move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes in the same position as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative.Lalic 1998, p.143 Kullamaa‚ÄìStarke, Correspondence 1991 White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back.Borik 1986, p.91 To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.Tseitlin 1992, p.96 The line 4.Qc2 immediately attacks the Ne4, as a retreat by Black would effectively surrender his temporary lead in development, which is the compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Black must continue to develop while trying to keep the Ne4 on its square, but that is by no means easy. Borik thinks 4.Qc2 is the move \\"that gives Black the most problems to solve\\",Borik 1986, p.68 but Lalic does not agree at all, stating that the reply \\"4...Bb4+ [....] followed by d7‚Äìd5 ensures Black a rapid development and plenty of counterplay. It is for this reason that 4.Qc2 is not on the danger list\\".Lalic 1998, p.152 The reply 4...Bb4+ (see diagram) pins the white pieces before deciding what to do with the Ne4. White cannot reply 5.Bd2 as he would lose the bishop pair and Black would easily regain the e5-pawn with Nc6/Qe7/0-0/Re8. After 5.Nd2 this knight would be misplaced and would block the Bc1, so Black could open the game with 5...d5 in favourable circumstances. Best for White is 5.Nc3 d5 6.exd6 Bf5 7.Bd2 Nxd6 8.e4! Bxc3 9.Bxc3 Bxe4 when Black has regained his pawn but White has the bishop pair and possibilities of an attack on the kingside.Borik 1986, p.84 Other possibilitiesLine 3...Ng4 4.e3= 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e3 Apart from the main lines 4.Bf4, 4.Nf3 and 4.e4, the only significant other fourth move is 4.e3 to continue by 4...Nxe5 5.Nh3 (or the other move- order 4.Nh3 and 5.e3) so that the white knight starts the journey Ng1‚Äìh3‚Äìf4‚Äìd5 reach its ideal d5-square.According to Tseitlin, this idea first occurred in the game Baginskaite‚ÄìStroe, Vilnius 1986 The idea with 4.e3 and 5.Nh3 was favourite of a leading Soviet coach and writer Mikhail Shereshevsky, who wrote in his 1994 book The Soviet Chess Conveyor that the line was first shown to him by a strong correspondence player Donatas Lapienis. Black has tried to prevent White's idea by the suitably strange-looking move 5...Ng6, taking the f4-square from the Nh3. Then White can develop along various setups, the most active being 6.Qh5 with the possibility Nh3‚Äìg5 in store to recycle the knight towards a more central position.Lalic 1998, p.101 Marin‚Äìde la Villa, Szirak interzonal 1987 Black can also ignore White's intentions and concentrate on his own play by placing the Nb8 on c5, in order to put pressure on the d3-square. After 5...g6 6.Nf4 Bg7 7.Be2 0-0 8.0-0 d6 9.Nc3 Nbd7 10.Qd2 a5 11.b3 Nc5 the position of Black's knights is secured and Black's position is similar to the Leningrad variation of the Dutch Defence (once he has played f7‚Äìf5).Lalic 1998, p.98‚Äì99 Zwikowski‚ÄìGurieli, Genting Highlands 1990 Zayats - Malaniuk, Minsk 1988 White has no reason, however, to abandon the a1‚Äìh8 diagonal to Black, and he can try 5...g6 6.Bd2 d6 7.Nf4 Bg7 8.Bc3 0-0 9.Be2 Nbd7 10.Nd2 b6 and in one game White gained a minimal edge.Lalic 1998, p.98 Aleksandrov‚ÄìPavlenko, Ashkhabad 1990 =Other fourth moves after 3...Ng4= A few other lines have been tried, with the outcome varying from an immediate equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss of the right to castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled.Lalic 1998, p.127 Henriksson‚ÄìWiander, Helsingborg 1991 The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal.Lalic 1998, p.129 Akhundov‚ÄìSimonenko, Ashkhabad 1990Borik 1986, p.55Tseitlin 1992, p.111 Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7‚Äìd6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed. Another reasonable-looking move is 4.Qd4 as it protects the e5-pawn and attacks the Ng4. However, \\"the problem for White in the Budapest is that natural moves often lead to disaster\\".Lalic 1998, p.129 Best for Black is the gambit 4...d6 5.exd6 Nc6! 6.Qd1 Bxd6, when the natural 7.Nf3?? is an error because of 7...Nxf2! 8.Kxf2 Bg3+ winning the queen.Tseitlin 1992, p.18 White must develop quietly with moves like Nc3/Nf3/e3/Be2, allowing Black to find active positions for his pieces with 0-0/Be6/Qe7/Rfd8, and preparing several sacrificial ideas on e3 or f2, with excellent attacking possibilities.Tseitlin 1992, p.20 Similar to 4.Qd4 is 4.Qd5 when after 4...Nc6 White can seize the last opportunity to return to calm waters with 5.Bf4 Bb4+ 6.Nc3 which will transpose in the Rubinstein line,Tseitlin 1992, p.15 or he can try 5.Nf3 d6 6.exd6 Be6 7.d7+ Bxd7 when Black's lead in development compensates for the pawn.Borik 1986, p.57 =Declining the gambit= Declining the gambit is almost never seen in master play because it promises White equality at best. After 3.d5?! Bc5 White has prematurely blocked the central position, giving the a7‚Äìg1 diagonal to Black for his bishop. In this variation Black can either play on the queenside with a plan like b5/Nb6/Bd7, or on the kingside with a plan like Ne8/g6/Ng7/f5.Tseitlin 1992, p.12, citing Kwiatkowski The shy 3.e3?! exd4 4.exd4 transposes into a line of the Exchange Variation of the French Defence with 4...d5, but Black can also develop rapidly with 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 Bxd2+ 6.Nxd2 0-0.Borik 1986, p.93Tseitlin 1992, p.12 After 3.e4?

He has been secretary-general of the Singapore People's Party (SPP) since 5 November 2019 after the long-time and former opposition Member of Parliament (MP) Chiam See Tong stepped down. and was the secretary-general of the National Solidarity Party (NSP) from 2001 to 2005. He served as the Non- constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) from 5 November 2001 to 18 April 2006, during which time the NSP was part of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).NSP Quits, Chiam takes it in stride, Kwek, Ken, The Straits Times, pg H4, 20 Jan 2007 Biography In 1985, at the age of 15, Chia was sentenced to two years' probation by a juvenile court following an incident where he and group of other boys broke into a school and committed vandalism. In his book Called to Serve, Chia notes that the incident left him determined to turn his life around. He went on to graduate from Nanyang Junior College in 1988. During his national service, Chia became an officer in the Singapore Armed Forces despite the discovery of an inborn heart defect late in his officer cadet training which resulted in him being put on light duties for the final two months of the course. His commanders were nevertheless impressed by his performance and wrote in to appeal for him to be commissioned as an officer. The appeal was approved, and he became the only person to have graduated from the Officer Cadet Course without taking the senior term Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) and Standard Obstacle Course.Foreword to NSP website , 27 April 2006, accessed 19 Sep 2006. Chia then became a student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), where he read Psychology and Philosophy. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1994. He was active in student politics during his time at NUS, and was elected the President of the National University of Singapore Students' Union (NUSSU) in 1993.http://studentry.sg/2012/08/24/union-forum-2012-rethinking-the-role-of- the-union/ Union Forum 2012: Rethinking the Role of the Union =Political career= Chia first took an interest in national politics during a by- election in the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency in 1992, when he attended one of the National Solidarity Party's campaign rallies. (He had intended to attend a rally of the Singapore Democratic Party, for whom Chia's Psychology lecturer Chee Soon Juan was standing as a candidate, but he went to the wrong location and ended up at the NSP's rally instead.) After graduating from NUS in 1995, Chia joined the NSP. At the 1997 general election, he was a member of the party's teams in the Hong Kah Group Representation Constituency, and was defeated by the team from the governing People's Action Party (PAP) by 36,920 votes (31%) to 82,182 (69%). Prior to the 2001 general election, the National Solidarity Party joined the Singapore Democratic Alliance. Chia stood as the SDA's candidate in the single-member constituency of Chua Chu Kang at the 2001 general election. During the election campaign, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong unexpectedly praised Chia, noting that he appeared to be more professional than many of the other opposition candidates. (Goh later claimed that he did so because he was confident that the PAP candidate in Chua Chu Kang would win, but wanted to help Chia claim and a Non-constituency MP's seat. In his book Called to Serve, Chia speculates that Goh did this because he remembered Chia from discussions they had had in 1993 about the establishment of the NUS Students' Trust Fund.) Chia was defeated by the PAP's Low Seow Chay by 8,143 votes (34.66%) to 14,489 (65.34%). As this was the highest percentage of the vote garnered by any opposition losing candidate at the election, Chia therefore became a Non-constituency MP.The NSP CEC - National Solidarity Party, URL accessed on 7 March 2006 At the 2006 general election, Chia improved his percentage of the vote in Chua Chu Kang, but still lost to the PAP's Gan Kim Yong by 9,292 votes (39.63%) to 14,156 (60.37%). This was not enough to enable him to hold on to his NCMP seat as the team from the Workers' Party in the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency surpassed him with 43.91% of the votes.http://www.asiaone.com/specials/ge2006/results.html www.asiaone.com : Singapore General Election 2006 Results (The Workers' Party's Sylvia Lim became the next NCMP.) Chia contested a fourth time in the 2011 general election in the newly carved out single-member constituency of Pioneer against the PAP's Cedric Foo, who was already the MP for the district when it was part of the West Coast Group Representation Constituency. However Chia fell short again, winning 39.27% of the votes.http://www.elections.gov.sg/elections_results2011.html Singapore Elections Department : 2011 PARLIAMENTARY GENERAL ELECTION RESULTS Ahead of the 2015 general election, the NSP announced that it planned field Chia as a candidate in the single-member constituency of MacPherson. This was a controversial decision as the Workers' Party had already announced that it planned to field a candidate against the PAP in the constituency. The NSP's acting secretary-general, Hazel Poa, resigned from the party following the announcement stating that she disagreed with the decision of the party's Central Executive Committee to contest the constituency. On 22 August 2015, Chia released a statement on Facebook announcing that he had decided not to be the NSP's candidate in MacPherson and would not be standing in the general election. He stated that \\"the Trolls have won\\" because negative online posts had been a key factor in his decision to withdraw.NSP's Steve Chia withdraws from MacPherson SMC contest, citing online abuse . The Straits Times, 23 August 2015. (The NSP subsequently decided to field Cheo Chai Chen in MacPherson.) Chia subsequently resigned from the NSP and joined the Singapore People's Party in 2018, becoming its Organising Secretary. On 16 October 2019, Chia was re-elected into the SPP CEC and on 5 November 2019, was made secretary-general of the SPP. The difference with his stint as secretary- general in NSP was that the NSP President was the top post, whereas for SPP, he succeeded Chiam See Tong as the leader of the party. =Controversies= In 2003, while Chia was an NCMP, he was involved in a scandal when topless photos of a maid who worked in his home were discovered by his wife Doreen Chee in his computer's \\"recycle bin\\". His wife lodged a police report. Chia insisted that his maid had agreed to pose for the photos and that he did not force her to do so. He noted that he had an interest in nude photography, and even showed the press nude photos that he had taken of himself (with his back to the camera) to prove this. Police investigations found no evidence that an offence had been committed. In 2006, Chia was fined following an incident when he drove a car through a red light, causing a crash with a bus.With Charges Reduced, Chia has GE chance after all, Today, pg4, 17 Mar 2006 ReferencesExternal links * Page at NSP website * Called to Serve - A compilation of Parliamentary Speeches & Questions (10th Singapore Parliament, 2002-2006) by NCMP Steve Chia Autobiography about himself and 10th Singapore Parliament. * Steve Chia's campaign website for Pioneer SMC Category:Singaporean Non- constituency Members of Parliament Category:National Solidarity Party (Singapore) politicians Category:National University of Singapore alumni Category:Nanyang Junior College alumni Category:Singaporean people of Teochew descent Category:Living people Category:1970 births ","title":"Steve Chia"},{"id":"1630638","text":"Gary Michael Stevens (born 27 March 1963) is an English physiotherapist and retired footballer, who played as a right back. Debuting in 1982, he played in the successful Everton side of the 1980s, where he won the English League Championship twice, the FA Cup once, and the European Cup Winners' Cup once. He was later named by Everton supporters as part of the clubs' greatest ever side. He then transferred to Rangers in 1988, where he won the Scottish Premier Division in six consecutive years and the Scottish Cup once. Upon leaving Rangers in 1994, he signed for Tranmere Rovers, playing there until his retirement in 1998. He also played for the England national football team, gaining a total of forty-six appearances, and playing at the World Cup in both 1986 and 1990. In 2002, Stevens graduated from the University of Salford with a degree in Physiotherapy.\\"Having a Ball\\" , Willaston Physio 18 September 2009 He then worked as a physiotherapist with the Bolton Wanderers Academy, and later became a coach at Chester City. In 2011, Stevens emigrated to Perth, Western Australia, continuing in the line of physiotherapy. CareerEverton= A hard-tackling right full back, Stevens advanced through Everton's youth ranks as manager Howard Kendall steadily built a new young side to rival their great foes Liverpool, who were winning trophies and dominating the English game while Everton had been without a domestic honour since 1970. Stevens made his Everton debut in 1982 and settled into the senior game quickly during the second half of the 1981‚Äì82 season as Kendall's otherwise ageing side struggled to make an impact on their rivals and on the top flight in general during the first couple of years after Kendall's appointment in 1981. However, with a few astute signings and one or two more graduates from the ranks, Everton reached the FA Cup final in 1984, having already lost to their great rivals in the League Cup final earlier in the season. Stevens played his part in Everton's opening goal at Wembley against Watford ‚Äì his pace enabling him to reach a loose ball from a half-cleared cross first and set up Graeme Sharp for a clinical finish. Everton won 2‚Äì0. The following year, Stevens was an integral part of the Everton team which chased a treble of League Championship, FA Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. The title was clinched but Everton were beaten by Manchester United (reduced to ten men after Kevin Moran was sent off) in the FA Cup final. However, a glorious and eventful run in Europe ended in triumph for Everton and Stevens when the Cup Winners' Cup was clinched, thanks to a 3‚Äì1 win over Rapid Vienna. The only downside of such a successful season was that the Heysel Stadium disaster and subsequent disqualification of all English clubs from European competition meant that Everton were disallowed from trying their luck in the European Cup the following year. Stevens was again a regular as Everton aimed to defend their League title in 1986, but a rejuvenated Liverpool overhauled them. The two also met in the FA Cup final ‚Äì the first ever all-Merseyside affair ‚Äì and Liverpool won that game 3‚Äì1 to clinch only the third modern-day \\"double\\". Stevens shouldered some of the blame ‚Äì he played a loose pass which was intercepted by Liverpool's Ronnie Whelan and led to an equaliser for the men in red, who went on to win 3‚Äì1. Stevens again played frequently as the blue half of Merseyside regained the League championship in 1987, although he did incur the wrath of Liverpool fans when a tackle on left back Jim Beglin left the Liverpool player with a badly broken leg, which finally led to his retirement from playing in 1990. At club level, 1988 was not successful for Everton, although Stevens did score a famous goal to give Everton a 1‚Äì0 win over Liverpool in the League Cup, at a time when Liverpool were in the process of a 29-game unbeaten start to the league season. Everton were trophyless once again. =Rangers= In the summer of 1988, Everton accepted a ¬£1.2 5million bid from Rangers for Stevens to move north of the border. Rangers were in the midst of a revolution when Stevens joined, with manager Graeme Souness buying non-Scottish players (including many Englishmen) to bolster his side. Stevens' first season ended with a Scottish Premier Division title. He would win five more, plus two Scottish Cups and three Scottish League Cups. Stevens continued to play for Rangers until 1994, and in 1993 was a key player in their treble winning side. His final season saw them retain the Scottish league title and Scottish League Cup, but their hopes of a second successive treble were ended with a shock Scottish Cup defeat at the hands of Dundee United. =Tranmere Rovers= Having started the 1994‚Äì95 out of favour at Ibrox as manager Walter Smith selected Alex Cleland at right back in the Rangers team, Stevens accepted an offer to move to English Division One promotion challengers Tranmere Rovers on 22 September 1994 for a fee of ¬£350,000. He featured regularly at right back for the Prenton Park club over the next four seasons, making 127 league appearances and helping them qualify for the playoffs (where they lost to Reading in the semi finals) before managing three successive mid table finishes. Stevens then retired from playing at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. International career England at UEFA Euro 1988, as the Netherlands' Marco van Basten scores the first of his three goals After a fine season for Everton, Stevens was given his debut for England by Bobby Robson in June 1985, and he quickly established himself as first choice right back for his country. Stevens was named in the squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup (along with the Tottenham Hotspur player Gary A. Stevens, which caused a spot of confusion. England supporters humorously chanted \\"Two Gary Stevens! There's only two Gary Stevens!\\") and played in all of the games as England reached the quarter finals, where they were beaten controversially by Argentina, who went on to win the tournament. England also qualified for UEFA Euro 1988 with Stevens in his familiar No.2 shirt. By now one or two critics had started to scorn him for supposedly poor positional play and ball distribution, but his coaches at club and international level kept resolute faith in him. Unfortunately, the competition was a disaster for both England and Stevens. After a shock defeat to the Republic of Ireland, England went into the tough second group game against the Netherlands needing to win. Stevens was, however, instrumental in the defeat which followed, losing the ball to Ruud Gullit down the flank, which led to the opening goal of a famous hat-trick by Marco van Basten. Stevens had come close to blocking Van Basten's shot when he'd been caught napping wide on the flank seconds earlier by Gullit, showing his speed and determination, but it was tough to accept as England wimped out of the tournament without a point. When England qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, Stevens was duly named in the squad though again a handful of critics had been scathing of his displays. However, he was in the side which faced the Republic of Ireland in the opening game. It ended 1‚Äì1 ‚Äì not a disaster, but there were clear problems with the England personnel and tactics and Robson made changes for the next game. Stevens was replaced by Paul Parker, who played so well (despite being more usually a central defender for Queens Park Rangers) that he kept his place up to and including England's dramatic semi-final exit on penalties against West Germany, the eventual winners. Stevens was recalled to play the host nation in the third place play-off, which England lost 2‚Äì1. Parker's emergence ‚Äì plus that of Arsenal right-back Lee Dixon ‚Äì left Stevens looking increasingly out of the frame for international football, especially as Robson had quit to return to club football, but he stuck around sporadically for the next two years, getting occasional starts and sub appearances under Graham Taylor. England qualified for UEFA Euro 1992 but Stevens was left out of Taylor's initial squad in favour of Dixon. When Dixon got injured in the grace period prior to the deadline for squad confirmation, Stevens was recalled, but then he too suffered an injury and withdrew. England ended up taking part in the competition without a recognised right back, and exited in the group stage. Stevens had played his last game for his country. His international career ended with forty-six appearances, although he never scored a goal.

Much of his work has been devoted to critiques of French society and culture. Biography Bruckner attended Jesuit schools in his youth.Bruckner, Pascal (2013). Against Environmental Panic,\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education, 17 June 2013, accessed 29 June 2013 After studies at the universities of Paris I and Paris VII Diderot, and then at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes, Bruckner became ma√Ætre de conf√©rences at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris and a contributor to the Nouvel Observateur. Bruckner began writing in the vein of the nouveaux philosophes or New Philosophers. He published Parias (Parias), Lunes de fiel (Evil Angels) (adapted as a film by Roman Polanski) and Les voleurs de beaut√© (The Beauty Stealers) (Prix Renaudot in 1997). Among his essays are La tentation de l'innocence (\\"The Temptation of Innocence,\\" Prix M√©dicis in 1995) and, famously, Le Sanglot de l'Homme blanc (The Tears of the White Man), an attack on narcissistic and destructive policies intended to benefit the Third World, and more recently La tyrannie de la p√©nitence (2006), a book on the West's endless self-criticism, translated as \\"The Tyranny of Guilt\\" (2010). From 1992 to 1999, Bruckner was a supporter of the Croatian, Bosnian and Kosovar causes against Serbian aggression, and endorsed the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999. In 2003, he supported the toppling of Saddam Hussein, but later criticized the mistakes of the U.S. military and the use of torture in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. Le Sanglot de l'Homme blanc Le Sanglot de l'Homme blanc (The White Man's Tears), published by the √âditions le Seuil in May 1983, was a controversial opus. The author describes what he sees as the anti-Western and pro-Third-World sentimentalism of some of the Left in the West. The essay had an influence on a whole trend of thought, especially on Maurice Dantec and Michel Houellebecq. The title is a variation on Kipling's \\"White Man's Burden\\". La tyrannie de la p√©nitence Bruckner's 2006 work La Tyrannie de la P√©nitence: Essai sur le Masochisme Occidental (The Tyranny of Guilt: An Essay on Western Masochism)Daniel Pipes, April, 2010Daniel Pipes, Dec. 2015 claims that Western intellectuals have been guilt- tripping themselves, opening the West up to mass invasion from Africa and the Muslim world that threatens to destroy the very foundations of its culture. The leftist view can be summarized in the statement: \\"The white man has sown grief and ruin wherever he has gone.\\" This white guilt has led leftists to not only reject the Renaissance but to romanticize the \\"South\\" (Africa and the Middle East) as innocent victims, and revile Israel. \\"Nothing is more Western than hatred of the West... All of modern thought can be reduced to mechanical denunciations of the West, emphasizing the latter's hypocrisy, violence, and abomination.\\" \\"Europe relieves itself of the crime of the Shoah by blaming Israel, it relieves itself of the sin of colonialism by blaming the United States.\\" [The Palestinian question has] \\"quietly relegitimated hatred of the Jews\\", making Europe \\"the sick man of the planet\\". He concludes that the U.S. remains \\"the last great nation in the West\\" because \\"Whereas America asserts itself, Europe questions itself.\\" =Criticism of multicultural ethnocentrism= Bruckner's polemic stance against the ethnocentric nature of some discourses of multiculturalism has kindled an international debate.Pascal Bruckner, Enlightenment Fundamentalism or Racism of the Anti-Racists?, appeared originally in German in the online magazine Perlentaucher on 24 January 2007. In an article titled \\"Enlightenment Fundamentalism or Racism of the Anti-Racists?\\", he defended Ayaan Hirsi Ali in particular against the criticisms from Ian Buruma and Timothy Garton Ash. According to Bruckner, modern philosophers from Heidegger to Gadamer, Derrida, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno have mounted a broad attack on the Enlightenment, claiming that \\"all the evils of our epoch were spawned by this philosophical and literary episode: capitalism, colonialism, totalitarianism.\\" Bruckner agrees that the history of the twentieth century attests to the potential of modernity for fanaticism, but argues that the modern thought that issued from the Enlightenment proved capable of criticizing its own errors, and that \\"Denouncing the excesses of the Enlightenment in the concepts that it forged means being true to its spirit.\\" Books *Parias: roman, Seuil, 1985, . *Lunes de fiel: roman, Seuil, 1981, . *Evil angels: a novel, Grove Press, 1987, . *Les Voleurs de beaut√©: roman, B.

It grows to 10‚Äì17 m tall and has distinctive spined thick, corky lumps 2‚Äì3 cm long on the bark. The leaves are glabrous and leathery, pinnately compound, 20‚Äì30 cm long with 7-19 leaflets, each leaflet 4‚Äì5 cm long. The flowers are dioecious, in panicles up to 20 cm long, each flower small, 6‚Äì8 mm diameter, with 3-5 white petals. The fruit is a two-valved capsule 6 mm diameter with a rough surface, and containing several small black seeds. The tree has also been called Z. macrophyllum. The genus name is sometimes spelled Xanthoxylum. Hence \\"Hercules club\\" Along with the related Zanthoxylum americanum, it is sometimes called \\"toothache tree\\" or \\"tingle tongue\\" because chewing on the leaves, bark, or twigs causes a tingling numbness of the mouth, tongue, teeth and gums. It was used for such medicinal purposes by both Native Americans and early settlers to treat toothache because of this. The tree has a rounded crown and requires plentiful water and sunlight. Its leaves are browsed by deer and its fruit is eaten by birds. The fruit passes through birds, which helps the seeds to germinate. The new trees tend to sprout below the favorite resting places of the birds, along fence rows and the edge of woods. It is known to be host to a number of insect species, including the Giant Swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) and the leaf beetle Derospidea brevicollis. Potentially confused species The name Hercules' club is also applied to Aralia spinosa, also native to eastern North America.

Decay heat is the heat released as a result of radioactive decay. This heat is produced as an effect of radiation on materials: the energy of the alpha, beta or gamma radiation is converted into the thermal movement of atoms. Decay heat occurs naturally from decay of long-lived radioisotopes that are primordially present from the Earth's formation. In nuclear reactor engineering, decay heat continues to be generated after the reactor has been shut down (see SCRAM and nuclear chain reactions) and power generation has been suspended. The decay of the short-lived radioisotopes created in fission continues at high power, for a time after shut down. The major source of heat production in a newly shut down reactor is due to the beta decay of new radioactive elements recently produced from fission fragments in the fission process. Quantitatively, at the moment of reactor shutdown, decay heat from these radioactive sources is still 6.5% of the previous core power, if the reactor has had a long and steady power history. About 1 hour after shutdown, the decay heat will be about 1.5% of the previous core power. After a day, the decay heat falls to 0.4%, and after a week it will be only 0.2%. Because radioisotopes of all half life lengths are present in nuclear waste, enough decay heat continues to be produced in spent fuel rods to require them to spend a minimum of one year, and more typically 10 to 20 years, in a spent fuel pool of water, before being further processed. However, the heat produced during this time is still only a small fraction (less than 10%) of the heat produced in the first week after shutdown. If no cooling system is working to remove the decay heat from a crippled and newly shut down reactor, the decay heat may cause the core of the reactor to reach unsafe temperatures within a few hours or days, depending upon the type of core. These extreme temperatures can lead to minor fuel damage (e.g. a few fuel particle failures (0.1 to 0.5%) in a graphite moderated gas-cooled design) or even major core structural damage (meltdown) in a light water reactor or liquid metal fast reactor. Chemical species released from the damaged core material may lead to further explosive reactions (steam or hydrogen) which may further damage the reactor.http://www- pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf Natural occurrence Naturally occurring decay heat is a significant source of the heat in the interior of the Earth. Radioactive isotopes of uranium, thorium and potassium are the primary contributors to this decay heat, and this radioactive decay is the primary source of heat from which geothermal energy derives.http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable- energy/how-geothermal-energy-works.html How Geothermal energy works Power reactors in shutdown Decay heat as fraction of full power for a reactor SCRAMed from full power at time 0, using two different correlations In a typical nuclear fission reaction, 187 MeV of energy are released instantaneously in the form of kinetic energy from the fission products, kinetic energy from the fission neutrons, instantaneous gamma rays, or gamma rays from the capture of neutrons.DOE fundamentals handbook - Nuclear physics and reactor theory - volume 1 of 2, module 1, page 61 An additional 23 MeV of energy are released at some time after fission from the beta decay of fission products. About 10 MeV of the energy released from the beta decay of fission products is in the form of neutrinos, and since neutrinos are very weakly interacting, this 10 MeV of energy will not be deposited in the reactor core. This results in 13 MeV (6.5% of the total fission energy) being deposited in the reactor core from delayed beta decay of fission products, at some time after any given fission reaction has occurred. In a steady state, this heat from delayed fission product beta decay contributes 6.5% of the normal reactor heat output. When a nuclear reactor has been shut down, and nuclear fission is not occurring at a large scale, the major source of heat production will be due to the delayed beta decay of these fission products (which originated as fission fragments). For this reason, at the moment of reactor shutdown, decay heat will be about 6.5% of the previous core power if the reactor has had a long and steady power history. About 1 hour after shutdown, the decay heat will be about 1.5% of the previous core power. After a day, the decay heat falls to 0.4%, and after a week it will be only 0.2%. The decay heat production rate will continue to slowly decrease over time; the decay curve depends upon the proportions of the various fission products in the core and upon their respective half-lives. An approximation for the decay heat curve valid from 10 seconds to 100 days after shutdown is ::\\\\frac{P}{P_0} = 0.066 \\\\left( \\\\left( \\\\tau - \\\\tau_s \\\\right)^{-0.2} - \\\\tau^{-0.2} \\\\right) where P is the decay power, P_0 is the reactor power before shutdown, \\\\tau is the time since reactor startup and \\\\tau_s is the time of reactor shutdown measured from the time of startup (in seconds). For an approach with a more direct physical basis, some models use the fundamental concept of radioactive decay. Used nuclear fuel contains a large number of different isotopes that contribute to decay heat, which are all subject to the radioactive decay law, so some models consider decay heat to be a sum of exponential functions with different decay constants and initial contribution to the heat rate. A more accurate model would consider the effects of precursors, since many isotopes follow several steps in their radioactive decay chain, and the decay of daughter products will have a greater effect longer after shutdown. :\\\\frac{P}{P_0} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{11}P_i e^{-\\\\lambda t}. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after normal shutdown or following a loss-of-coolant accident. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents, including the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Fukushima I. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, from which heat is removed via heat exchangers. Water is passed through the secondary side of the heat exchanger via the essential service water systemPre-construction safety report - Sub-chapter 9.2 ‚Äì Water Systems AREVA NP / EDF, published 2009-06-29, accessed 2011-03-23 which dissipates the heat into the 'ultimate heat sink', often a sea, river or large lake. In locations without a suitable body of water, the heat is dissipated into the air by recirculating the water via a cooling tower. The failure of ESWS circulating pumps was one of the factors that endangered safety during the 1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood.  Spent fuel  After one year, typical spent nuclear fuel generates about 10 kW of decay heat per tonne, decreasing to about 1 kW/t after ten years.world-nuclear.org - Some physics of uranium Hence effective active or passive cooling for spent nuclear fuel is required for a number of years.

They were played mostly on wooden flutes, and thus the pieces that have survived till today are written in D, which is the key these early flutes were made in. This is also why, unlike most Chinese music, these pieces are not written in a pentatonic scale, but in a more middle eastern style. We can tell this because the ornamentation of these pieces is very similar to that of the bagpipes, which were invented in India, and also surprisingly the penny whistle and other Celtic instruments. These pieces were highly ornamented. Grace notes are used instead of tonguing, a technique used by the bagpipes. Unlike in most western music, any two notes were used as grace notes, rather than a tone gap. These pieces were written by taking a short theme and developing it in three sections, each section adding more complex ornaments and rhythms as it progresses. Unlike the European folk structure which normally goes ABABAB etc., as in modern pop music, Chinese folk songs have a structure of AAA, or if you count the development as a change then: ABC.

Umbro designs, sources, and markets football-related apparel, footwear, and equipment. Its products are sold in over 90 countries worldwide. Since 2012, the company has been a subsidiary of American company Iconix Brand Group,Umbro at Iconix Brand website , retrieved 11 February 2013 after being bought by Nike in 2007. HistoryBeginning and expansion= The company was founded in 1920 by Harold Humphreys, along with his brother Wallace in a small workshop in Wilmslow, Cheshire, inspired by the growing interest in football witnessed nationwide. The name was changed in 1924 to \\"Umbro\\" and is a quasi-portmanteau inspired by Humphreys Brothers Clothing. Umbro's kit debut was in the 1934 FA Cup final, when both teams Manchester City and Portsmouth wore kits designed and manufactured by the company. Other teams supplied by Umbro during the 1930s and 1940s were Sheffield United, Preston North End, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Blackpool. Umbro was the official sports manufacturer of the English FA Cup and official sponsor of The FA, being the exclusive supplier of balls to the body's leagues. In 1952, the British team at the Summer Olympics wore Umbro kits, tailored for the needs of their individual sports. Umbro would supply kits for the British Olympics team for the next 20 years. In 1957, Umbro entered the tennis market, producing sports clothing in collaboration with player Ted Tinling. This collaboration extended for three decades. Another sportsman who collaborated with Umbro was Manchester United manager Matt Busby, in 1959. That same year the company started to sell its junior boys' kits, a set of shirt, shorts and socks that would allow young players to wear the same look as their footballing idols. Brazil won its first World Cup in 1958 wearing Umbro kits Brazil became the first FIFA World Cup champion to wear kits by Umbro in 1958. Two years later, Manchester United Scottish player Denis Law signed an exclusive agreement with the brand, becoming the first footballer to be sponsored by Umbro. The England national team won its only title in 1966 wearing kits by Umbro (the deal had been signed in 1954). Of the 16 teams that competed, 15 wore kit manufactured by Umbro,Umbro history website, retrieved 27 March 2013 the only exception being the USSR. At the same time, 85% of British football teams wore kits by the company, including Celtic, the first British team to win a European Cup in 1967. Liverpool FC won the first four of their six European Cups while wearing Umbro kits, in 1977, 1978, 1981 and 1984. In 1974, Umbro's founder, Harold Humphreys, died. His sons John and Stuart took over the running of the company. The England national team wore Umbro shirts by choice until 1974, when The Football Association, encouraged by the England manager Don Revie, sold the jersey manufacturing rights to Admiral Sportswear. After more than a decade wearing Admiral kits, the England national team signed with Umbro again in 1984. In 1986, Umbro began to manufacture its own football boots. The company added footballers Alan Shearer and Michael Owen (who was only 14 years old) to its list of sponsored athletes. In 1994, Brazil won its fourth FIFA World Cup title in the United States and club teams AFC Ajax (in 1995), and Manchester United (in 1999) obtained the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup, in Tokyo, all of them wearing Umbro kits. In the United States, Umbro was the majority owner (94%) of United Soccer Leagues, the parent organization for North America's lower division men's soccer (tiers two through four in the American Soccer Pyramid), and the second tier women's league (W-League) and youth league (Super Y-League). During the 2009 USL First Division season, the Carolina RailHawks, Charleston Battery, Vancouver Whitecaps, Rochester Rhinos, Austin Aztex, and Puerto Rico Islanders all wore Umbro kits. During the 2012 USLPro season, the Dayton Dutch Lions wore Umbro. In October 2007, JJB Sports bought a 10.1% stake in Umbro in a move to protect its stake in the market for England football shirts. =Nike agreement= United Soccer League for the 2009‚Äì10 seasonUSL Umbro Dynamis Match Ball 2009, 16 January 2009 On 23 October 2007, it was announced Umbro had agreed to be bought by Nike in a deal worth , the equivalent of 193p per share.

Eventually, in 1985, Umbro decided to introduce its first football boot into the Brazilian market. This design, cheaper than the products of existing boot brands such as Adidas, proved popular and went into mass production internationally two years later. Umbro also manufactured a popular style of shorts that reached its peak in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were made of nylon, had a drawstring waistband, and often came in bright colours. With the growth of youth soccer leagues in the U.S. in the 1980s, many youths, teens and young adults began wearing them as everyday clothing. At the height of the \\"Umbro fashion,\\" other brands of football shorts, such as Adidas, Diadora, Hummel, Lotto and Mitre, also became popular. Its major competitors in this market include Reebok, Nike, Adidas, Puma and Lotto. Other releases by Umbro include the Stealth boot, released in 2010 and worn by players such as Ga√´l Clichy and Phil Jagielka. The same year, the company released the GT, worn by then-Fulham striker Darren Bent. The company announced it as \\"its lightest ever boot.\\" This was succeeded by the GT II model. June 2011 saw the release of the Umbro Geometra Pro. In 2013, Umbro introduced to a new wave of releases that included the Speciali IV and the Geometra II. Following the purchase of the brand by Iconix Brand Group in 2013, the first major product release from Umbro was the UX-1, a technologically advanced football boot which was voted as one of the best new releases of the year. = Sponsorships = Umbro is the official supplier and sponsor of numerous association football teams, players and associations, including: Association FootballNational teams=Africa  * * Asia * Europe * North America  * =Club teams=Africa * USM El Harrach * Al Ahly * El Mansoura * Hearts of Oak * AFC Leopards * Lioli * Hassania Agadir * Cape Town City * Chippa United * Moroka Swallows F.C. * University of Pretoria * Club Africain * Esp√©rance de Tunis * Mufulira Wanderers * Nkana F.C. * Zanaco * ZESCO United  Asia  * Brisbane Roar * Central Coast Mariners * Melbourne Knights * Ponta Leste * Gamba Osaka * FC Tokyo * V-Varen Nagasaki * Warriors FC * PSM Makassar * ATK * Pahang * Pachanga Diliman * Al-Ahli SC * Seongnam FC * Naft Maysan FC  Europe  * Pirin Blagoevgrad * AFC Bournemouth * Blackburn Rovers * Brentford * Burnley * Derby County * Emley * Huddersfield Town * Hull City * Luton Town * West Ham United * Lahti * Caen * FC Chambly * L'Entente SSG * Guingamp * Reims * 1.

While better known for his work as a comedy actor on Puerto Rican television, Pumarejo released 16 albums of Puerto Rican music, with some of them becoming major hits in the island. Biography Ramos Pumarejo was born on October 12, 1932, in R√≠o Ca√±as, a barrio in Caguas, Puerto Rico, located closer to the mountain area of Caguas than from downtown San Juan. Having grown up in the mountains, Pumarejo identified himself with the Puerto Rican country people (known as j√≠baro) more than with the metropolitan people who are always associated with San Juan. Ramos Pumarejo started to work on Puerto Rican television when producer Paquito Cordero began producing a noon variety show called El Show de las 12 on Telemundo Puerto Rico, WKAQ-TV. To ensure that the public remembered him, he used his relatively uncommon maternal last name as part of his stage name. Like other popular Puerto Rican characters (Jos√© Miguel Agrelot's \\"Don Cholito\\", and Machuchal), Pumarejo donned a \\"pava\\" (a Puerto Rican peasant straw hat) for his television appearances. The pava became a staple in Pumarejo's life, as he began using it in almost every personal appearance and in interviews with newspapers and magazines. Pumarejo also earned the nickname of \\"El H√≠gado de Ganso\\" (\\"The Goose's Liver\\", or more accurately, foie gras). Pumarejo was well known for his self-deprecating sense of humor and physical comedy style, which closely resembled that of a young Jerry Lewis. He was also a stutterer, something to which he constantly made humorous references in his live performances. For example, he claimed that a television comedy sketch featuring himself, Adri√°n Garc√≠a and Marcos Betancourt, all stammerers, would be four hours long. Pumarejo was usually backed by his longtime musical combo, the R√≠o Ca√±as Sound Machine (a spoof of the Miami Sound Machine). In 1985, Pumarejo scored a Christmas music chart- topper, with his song \\"La Finquita\\" (\\"The Little Farm\\"), this time backed by the Conjunto Quisqueya, a very successful merengue band of mostly Dominican expatriates living in Puerto Rico. It was a number one hit in Puerto Rican radio for about eight consecutive weeks, and the album was also one of the year's best selling Christmas album in Puerto Rico, along with Tony Croatto's, which contained the famous song, \\"Se Llama Jes√∫s\\". Outside of his musical career, Pumarejo was also a very successful medical sales representative for Novartis International AG, for over thirty years (he retired prior to his death). He once had Novartis sponsor his television slot in El Show de las 12, and joked that only Novartis' product Maalox could be an appropriate sponsor, since he was the most \\"maalox\\" (malo is Spanish for \\"bad\\") singer ever. During the 1970s, Pumarejo also advertised Texaco on Puerto Rican television, alongside a popular Puerto Rican girl group of the time named Las Caribelles. Tavin Pumarejo died September 12, 2016, at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico after a long illness.

The SDERy was established by sugar heir and land developer John D. Spreckels in 1892. The railroad's original network consisted of five routes: the Fifth Street and Logan Heights Lines, the First and \\"D\\" Streets Lines, the Depot Line, the Ferry Line, and the \\"K\\" Street Shuttle. The company would establish additional operating divisions as traffic demands led to the formation of new lines. The company also engaged in limited freight handling primarily as an interchange with Spreckels' San Diego and Arizona Railway (SD&A;) from 1923 to 1929. At its peak, the SDERy's routes would operate throughout the greater San Diego area over some of track. Steadily declining ridership, due in large part to the phenomenal rise in popularity of the automobile, ultimately led the company to discontinue all streetcar service in favor of bus routes in 1949. Some see this as related to the National City Lines's General Motors streetcar conspiracy controversy, as the SDERy's president had been with NCL previously. The few surviving pieces of rolling stock are on display at the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum in Campo, the San Diego Electric Railway Association in National City, and the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California. HistoryPredecessors= \\"Rapid Transit in San Diego\\": An original 1886 horse-drawn trolley and its driver participate in a parade celebrating the groundbreaking of the Panama- California Exposition Center in 1911. On July 3, 1886 the first horse-drawn open-air streetcar of the San Diego Street Car Company (SDSCC) (founded by H. L. Story and E. S. Babcock) made its run up 5th Street. The fare was five cents. The following year on November 9, the first electric-powered streetcar made a test run on new tracks up Broadway to Kettner Boulevard and on to \\"Old Town\\". Electric streetcar service was inaugurated on November 19 on the San Diego and Old Town Street Railway, making it the first electric railway on the West Coast and the second in the country to use the \\"ground return\\" for electric current. In 1888, the Electric Rapid Transit Company (ERTC) put an electric streetcar into regular operation in San Diego. When ERTC failed, the San Diego Cable Railway (SDCR) was incorporated in July 1889 to replace it. The opening day of the SDCR was June 7, 1890 and it soon opened \\"Mission Cliffs Gardens\\", a small recreation park (one of San Diego's first public recreation areas) overlooking Mission Valley, as an end-of-the-line attraction for cable car patrons. Opening Day on the San Diego Cable Railway June 7, 1890 =San Diego Electric Railway Company= SDERy double-decker Car No. 1 pauses at the intersection of 5th Street & Market Street during its inaugural run on September 21, 1892. By November 30, 1891 John D. Spreckels incorporated the San Diego Electric Railway Company (SDERy). On January 30, the SDERy purchased the SDSCC and the majority of its assets for $115,000; over the next few years the company would also acquire the competing Park Belt Line and the Ocean Beach Railroad. Plans were made to convert all existing lines to traction, and ten single-truck, single-trolley, open platform wooden cars were subsequently purchased from the J. G. Brill and Company. Double- decker Car No. 1, the first such electrically operated car in the United States, made the inaugural run on September 21, 1892 with many of the City's notables aboard. A few weeks later, the SCCR completed its last run, the company having declared bankruptcy earlier in the year. At the end of 1892, the line had grown to of aggregated system track ( of single electrified track with for horse-drawn cars). Many new electrified lines were constructed during the coming years. In August 1895, the Citizens Traction Company (CTC) was formed and purchased the remains of the SDCR for $17,600, adapting the line to electric operation in order to compete with the SDERy. On July 28, 1896 the first converted trolley car ran the entire length of the long CTC line. However, by February 1897 financial difficulties forced the CTC to go into receivership. Elisa Babcock, as agent for the SDERy, bought the properties and franchises of the CTC in March 1898 for $19,000 plus \\"fees and costs.\\" The track gauge was subsequently widened from narrow gauge to . In 1905 Spreckels had a new power generating plant built to accommodate the additional loads imposed by the expanding streetcar network. He announced the following year the formation of San Diego and Arizona Railway (SD&A;) and plans for a line between San Diego and El Centro. The Third Avenue Streetcar Line began operation. The SDERy logged 798,152 car miles. By 1907 the Third Avenue Streetcar Line was extended to the future community of Mission Hills, and was briefly renamed the Mission Hills Line. Spreckels forced a ballot initiative in 1910 to amend his charter with the City of San Diego to give him more than 25 years on his leases to operate streetcar service. With this greater security he was able to acquire major loans for service expansion and infrastructure. The next year, the Imperial Avenue operating division was established downtown. Spreckels had a second power generating plant built at Kettner Boulevard and \\"E\\" Street, as the 1905 plant could no longer provide sufficient capacity. Ordered by Spreckels, with guidance by William Clayton and design by Homer MacNutt and Abel A. Butterworth, 24 Arts and Crafts-style streetcars (to be known as the 'Class 1' streetcar) were delivered to San Diego in 1912. The following year, construction of a new brick car barn located at Adams Avenue and Florida Street wa completed. By the end of 1914 the SDERy owned of single track and of double track, for a total of of \\"equivalent single track\\". The 1915 Panama-California Exposition in Balboa Park spurred the next phase of transportation growth. A new electric car line was constructed up 12th Street to the park's entrance with 101 new cars from the St. Louis Car Company, and the Adams Avenue operating division was established in Normal Heights. San Diego's original Victorian style train depot was demolished and replaced with a new Mission Revival Style Santa Fe depot building. The SDERy logged 3,521,571 car miles. The \\"Great Flood\\" in 1916 caused significant damage, washing out several rail lines. World War I increased the cost of railway construction materials by 50 to 150 percent. There was a significant increase in the private ownership of automobiles, and the SDERy began to lose revenue to private \\"Jitney Buses\\". On November 15, 1919 the \\"golden spike\\" was driven and construction of the SD&A; was ceremonially completed at a cost of $18 million (three times the original estimate). Spreckels announced plans in 1920 to discontinue service on several rail lines to offset expenses, leading to approval of \\"zone fares\\". The SDERy purchased new streetcars that requires only one driver/conductor instead of two; older cars were retrofitted to reduce labor costs. Spreckels sold his power generating plants to the Consolidated Gas and Electric Company. =The first motor buses= In 1921 the first motor bus went into service operating between National City and Chula Vista. \\"Number One\\" had hard rubber tires, two-wheel mechanical brakes, a four-cylinder engine, and a plywood body. On March 17, 1923 the SDERy began its last major rail line expansion to Mission Beach (\\"Belmont Park\\"), Pacific Beach, and La Jolla. $2.5 million were spent on rails, Mission Revival Style terminals and substations, and Egyptian Revival Style stations, and $800,000 were spent on the acquisition of 50 new cars. Construction was completed in 1925. Car No. 400, an all-steel model with a closed body and the first on the SDERy to feature a pantograph-type current collector, was delivered in December 1923. All 50 pantograph-equipped cars would eventually have trolley poles installed at each end due to the pantographs' poor performance. By 1930 buses began to replace street cars from Ocean Beach to La Jolla, and 222 new buses were added to the fleet. Ridership and revenue decreased but SDERy was able to weather the economic downturn. The 1935 California Pacific International Exposition opened in Balboa Park without the need for expanded transit service. In 1936 SDERy ordered 25 single-end Presidents Conference Committee (PCC) cars from the St. Louis Car Company, and was among the first streetcar systems in the United States to use streamlined units. The cars were designated as Class 6. An order for three additional units was placed the following year. World War II turned San Diego into a \\"boom town\\" again. The population of the city increased due to an influx of military personnel and defense-related industries, and ridership on public transit rose 600 percent during the war years. Used transit vehicles were purchased from around the nation, and more electrical substations were built (one in the basement of the Spreckels Theatre Building on Broadway). The $2.5 million rail line built in the 1920s to the beaches was ripped out, along with the elaborate stations and terminals, and replaced with a bus line. By 1942 the combined streetcar and bus lines carried 94 million people. Additional streetcars were brought in on loan from New York City, Salt Lake City, and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to help keep up with demand. Combined ridership in 1944 led to more than 146 million trips. In 1946 SDERy began to phase out streetcar lines and replace them with bus routes. By the following year, only three street car lines would remain in operation. =New owners and systematic conversion to buses= On July 26, 1948 the Western Transit Company (WTC), owned by Jesse Haugh, bought SDERy for $5.5 million. Haugh was also president of Key System and an executive of Pacific Electric Railway. The following month 13 new 45-passenger buses were placed into service. In September 1948 the WTC announced that the SDERy would henceforth be known as the San Diego Transit System (SDTS). A new emblem (consisting of a pair of wings with a shield in the center) and slogan, \\"Safety, Courtesy, Service,\\" were adopted. In January 1949 the SDTS borrowed $720,000 for the purchase of additional new buses, and made an application to the State Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to discontinue streetcar service, which the PUC granted in March. Sponsored by the Pacific Railroad Society of Los Angeles, a \\"farewell to the streetcars\\" excursion was held, operated over the remaining trackage. The following month 45 new GM buses (each costing $20,000) paraded down Broadway to mark the retirement of the street cars; free rides were offered during the procession. Rail service on the SDERy came to an end as Car No. 446 pulled into the Adams Avenue car barn, making San Diego the first major southwestern city to eliminate streetcars and convert to an all-bus transit system. In May 1949 work crews began removing the overhead trolley lines and tracks on the loop at Santa Fe Depot. In 1950, 17 of the PCC model cars were sold to the El Paso City Lines (EPCL) for service on the international loop between El Paso, Texas, and the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua. A few years later, three more PCCs were sold to EPCL. All remaining Class 5 cars and the three \\"service\\" cars were purchased by the Allied Salvage Company for scrap. The eight remaining PCCs were purchased in August 1957 by the San Diego Mill Supply Company. Car No. 508 was acquired by the Orange Empire Traction Company for display at its museum in Perris, California, and Car No. 528 was obtained by the San Diego Railway Historical Society for preservation and exhibition. =Revival: San Diego Trolley system= After years of planning and development, the \\"San Diego Trolley\\" (a new interurban light rail mass transit system) made its inaugural run on July 19, 1981 on the long \\"South Line\\" between Downtown and the Mexican border. The following week San Diego Trolley began revenue service; San Diego would become known in transit circles as \\"The city that started the 'light rail craze' in the United States\\". In August 1996, three \\"Class 1\\" streetcars were saved for San Diego. These cars, numbered 126, 128, and 138, had been ordered by John Spreckels in anticipation of the 1915 Panama California Exposition. The logo of the SDERy is still visible. The San Diego Historic Site Board recognized the three native \\"Class 1\\" streetcars with the official designation of San Diego Landmark #339. In February 2005, the San Diego Electric Railway Association salvaged the body shell of Car No. 357 (formerly of the Bellingham, Washington streetcar system) from a Downtown restaurant site where it had been used as a dining room since 1972. In December 2005, the San Diego Vintage Trolley Co. purchased three former San Francisco Municipal Railway PCC cars (one numbered 529). Car No. 529 was later fully restored for public rail service. Three other PCC cars, two from SEPTA and one from New Jersey (531-533), were subsequently purchased. In March 2014, MTS took possession of a second 1946 PCC streetcar, destined to join public service as Car #530. It was estimated that the mostly cosmetic restoration work required to restore Car #530 to service would take six to eight months. The PCC cars were planned to run on a loop route around Downtown using existing San Diego Trolley tracks. San Diego Metropolitan Transit System, in a partnership with the San Diego historic streetcar society, began select weekday, weekend and holiday mid-day service in August 2011 on this new heritage streetcar Silver Line, which operates around Downtown San Diego using the renovated PCC streetcar #529. By March 2011 MTS began work on a study to evaluate the feasibility of reconnecting Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo, and Downtown San Diego through a fixed-guideway, electrified streetcar line that might operate as an extension of the Silver Line and might be operated with other restored heritage streetcars. Routes Routes in 1925 - roughly the system's largest extent - were as follows:Line numbers taken from \\"Evolution of the San Diego Cityscape\\" by W.J.

A free-standing gable wall commemorates Free Derry, a self-declared autonomous nationalist area of Derry that existed between 1969 and 1972. On the corner is a memorial to the 1981 hunger strikers and several murals. There is also a memorial to those who died engaging in paramilitary activity as part of the Provisional IRA's Derry Brigade. In January 1969 a local activist, long believed to be John \\"Caker\\" Casey, but who might have been Liam Hillen, painted graffiti on a gable wall at the end of a housing terrace stating \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\". When the British Home Secretary, Jim Callaghan, visited Derry in August 1969, the \\"Free Derry\\" wall was painted white and the \\"You are now entering Free Derry\\" sign was professionally re-painted in black lettering. The area in front of the wall became known as Free Derry Corner by the inhabitants. It and the surrounding streets were the scene of the Battle of the Bogside in 1969 and Bloody Sunday in 1972. The houses on Lecky Road and Fahan Street were subsequently demolished, but the wall was retained. It has been repainted at frequent intervals. As currently situated, it now lies in the central reservation of Lecky Road, which was upgraded to a dual carriageway sometime following the demolition of the original terraced houses.

He is remembered for a controversial remark about Israel. Controversial remarkReported remark= In 2001, Daniel Bernard came to public attention when, as French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, he was quoted as saying: \\"All the current troubles in the world are because of that shitty little country Israel.\\" The diplomat added, \\"Why should the world be in danger of World War III because of those people?\\" The remark was reported to have taken place during a conversation with Conrad Black of The Daily Telegraph at a private dinner party Black was hosting. Bernard's comment was then later repeated in an article written by Black's wife, Barbara Amiel, in The Daily Telegraph. Initially, Bernard stated that he could not remember making it, but later insisted that what he said had been thoroughly distorted. Bernard's press secretary stated, \\"He does not deny the remarks, he just says first of all what he said was distorted.\\" He also stated that he was outraged that a private discussion was reported by the media and clearly stated that he would not apologise.'Anti-Semitic' French envoy under fire, BBC, December 20, 2001.French ambassador refuses to apologize by Jane Merrick, Irish Examiner, December 20, 2001. Bernard's spokesman, Yves Charpentier, stated that Bernard felt there was no need for him to apologize. He stated that \\"In the course of the discussion the ambassador referred to 'little Israel' in the sense that it is geographically small, but that nevertheless the scale of the consequences is huge and the repercussions around the world are tremendous.\\" =Bernard's response= In a subsequent letter to The Daily Telegraph, Bernard insisted his remarks had been distorted, writing that: > 'Over the past few days, I have been the subject of grave accusations > because of a comment I am reported to have made during a conversation with > Lord Black.

One British journalist, Deborah Orr did defend Bernard. British Labour MPs Jim Murphy and Gwyneth Dunwoody wrote to French President Jacques Chirac that asking that Bernard either resign or be removed from his position. Murphy stated that \\"If these are his views, then the French government should take action. Such views are simply not consistent with the post he holds\\" while Dunwoody stated that \\"These comments are eerily familiar from the French. He should resign immediately and I'm writing to President Chirac to demand that if he does not resign, then he should be sacked.\\"Israel seeks head of French envoy by Ewen MacAskill, Guardian UK, December 20, 2001. In Israel, the remark sparked outrage, with Raanan Gissin, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon calling Bernard's statement \\"a pure anti-Semitic expression\\" and further stating that the French Government \\"should draw the conclusions of a senior representative of a nation making an anti-Semitic remark\\". Gissin also stated that \\"If the French government does not take action, it would imply that the French government condones it and I think that would be inconceivable.\\" In the United States, the Anti-Defamation League stated that \\"It is highly troubling that a French government official would make such crude anti-Israel statements\\" and called for the French Foreign Ministry to investigate Bernard's remarks.ADL Asks French Foreign Ministry to Investigate Envoy's Derogatory Comments About Israel , Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - Letter to the Foreign Minister of France, December 21, 2001. The French Foreign Ministry defended Bernard and dismissed the charges of anti-Semitism. A Ministry spokesman stated that \\"These malevolent insinuations have been addressed very clearly by our ambassador in London and I suggest you refer back to that.\\" The French Press was also largely supportive of Bernard, while recognising that Bernard was a flamboyant character (Le Monde 2 May 2004). His obituary in Le Monde in 2004 also illustrates the same points. Bernard was reassigned to become France's ambassador to Algeria in July 2002. He died in April 2004 while serving in that post, at the age of 62.

Dwight offers the International Baccalaureate curriculum to students ages two through grade twelve. Approximately forty countries are represented among its student body. History Founded in 1872 by Julius Sachs as part of the Sachs Collegiate Institute, Dwight School was first known as \\"The Sachs School,\\" then The Franklin School. Originally located on West 34th Street and Broadway, it relocated several times as it grew, ultimately moving to 18 West 89th Street in 1912. Sachs, a noted educator and author (and scion of the Goldman‚ÄìSachs family) headed the school until 1901 when he was appointed Professor of Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.https://www.tcrecord.org/Signin.asp?cc=1&r;=2 In 1880, the New York School of Languages was founded on 15 West 43rd Street as an academy of classical studies. Timothy Dwight, President of Yale University asked the school to pioneer a math and science program to replace traditional Greek and Latin as an entrance requirement. The New York School of Languages was later renamed Timothy Dwight School in honor of that historic partnership. Dwight School merged with the Bentley School in 1977, in order to add elementary and middle school programs to its curriculum. In 1993, Dwight School merged with The Franklin School (which had adopted the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program in 1980). In 1996, Dwight School became the first school in North America to offer the full International Baccalaureate (IB) program from preschool through grade 12. With the opening in fall 2005 of Dwight's Early Childhood Division (formerly Woodside Preschool), the Dwight School' became the first school to offer the IB Primary Years Program for children ages three through five. Today, one-third of Dwight's students come from overseas. InstitutionChancellor= Stephen H. Spahn has been the School's Chancellor and Headmaster since 1967 and is the longest-serving head of an independent school in New York City. Spahn serves on the Boards of the International Baccalaureate Fund and the Rubin Museum of Art. He was also a founding member of the Guild of International Baccalaureate Schools. In 2011, Spahn was awarded the Lewis Hine Distinguished Service Award from the National Child Labor Committee.New York Post: http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/we_hear_Pxb7aJ9tTKmH1h4cAj8AZKThe National Child Labor Committee: http://www.nationalchildlabor.org/lha.html =Divisions and houses= There are four co-educational divisions at Dwight School: The Riverside Campus (preschool-kindergarten) occupies three buildings on Riverside Boulevard between 66th‚Äì68th Streets. The Lower School (grades 1‚Äì5) is located on the Main Campus and occupies a brownstone at 17 West 88th Street. The Middle School (grades 6‚Äì8) and the Upper School (grades 9‚Äì12), are also located on the Main Campus but primarily use the buildings at 18 West 89th Street and 291 Central Park West. In 2012, the school added additional classrooms and athletics space by expanding into the adjoining brownstone located at 22 West 89th Street. Within divisions, the grades are further separated into houses: Timothy House (grades 1‚Äì5), Bentley House (grades 6‚Äì8), Franklin House (grades 9‚Äì10), and Anglo House (grades 11‚Äì12). A dean oversees each house. An Executive Team consisting of the Head of School, Head of Upper School, Head of Middle School, and Head of Lower School manage the academic and pastoral areas of the school. The Head of School works closely with the School's Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor, who also oversee Admissions and the Business office. =Admissions= Admission to Dwight School is highly selective. Kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade are Dwight's largest entry points, with forty students entering kindergarten, fifteen entering sixth grade and twenty-five entering ninth grade. Each year, a smaller number of students are accepted in other grades. Dwight offers rolling admissions for international families due to the wide range of academic calendars around the world. The admissions process at Dwight School is based on school reports, teacher recommendations, ERB/ISEE test results, and student/parent interviews. =Dwight Schools Global Network= The Dwight Schools are an international network of campuses and programs, which include Dwight School in New York, Dwight Global Online School, Dwight School London in England, the Shanghai Qibao Dwight High School, in Shanghai, China, Dwight School Seoul, and Dwight School Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, which held its grand opening in September 2018.Korea Herald: http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110307000773 Opened in 2009, Dwight School Canada is one of five schools and programs in The Dwight Schools global network. Dwight School's association with Dwight School London goes back over 40 years when Stephen Spahn, Chancellor of Dwight School New York opened the school. In 2008, what was known as Woodside Park International School was renamed as The North London International School (NLIS) and later renamed Dwight School London in 2012. Dwight London is now one of the leading International Baccalaureate (IB) World Schools in the UK officially recognised to run all three IB programmes. In 2010, Dwight London opened a partner school in London called The Holmewood School(THSL) which aims to provide special education for children of high cognitive ability with difficulties associated with autism. In 2009, Dwight entered into the first joint diploma program in China with the Capital Normal High School, attached to Capital Normal University, in Beijing. Through this program, each student receives a joint Capital Normal/Dwight School diploma with strong emphasis on English as a Second Language. In 2010, Dwight was chosen from 180 foreign schools by the government of Seoul, Korea, to open Dwight School Seoul as a model IB School for five hundred forty students in grades K-12. Opened in fall 2012, the school is housed within a new multimillion-dollar media and culture complex, Seoul's Digital Media City.  Academics ‚Äì International Baccalaureate Program  In 1996, Dwight became the second school in North America to offer all three International Baccalaureate (IB) Programs: the IB Primary Years Program, for students ages 3 to 12; the IB Middle Years Program, for students in grades 6‚Äì10; and the IB Diploma Program, for students in grades 11-12. A Certificate Program is available to students who do not wish to pursue the full IB Diploma Program and instead take some elective courses. Approximately half the graduating seniors receive the full IB diploma. Demographics The demographic breakdown of the 574 students enrolled for the 2013‚Äì2014 school year is as follows.

He set up The National ZX80 User Group with Trevor Sharples in 1980 producing a more-or-less monthly magazine entitled Interface. This User Group then expanded to include the ZX81, Acorn Atom and Spectrum computers, and provided a springboard for Tim and Trevor to launch the first of their home computing books. His company, Interface Publications (set up with Elizabeth North), produced titles for all of the machines in the home computer market, including Sinclair machines. Hartnell wrote several compendiums of computer games, which typically had several categories of games, with several games in each category. Each category had tips for writing enjoyable games in that genre. Each game had a description of the program and an explanation of its implementation, sometimes with ideas for modifications; this was followed by the raw code, which the reader had to enter into the computer. Some long games, such as Bannochburn Legacy, had more than 500 lines of code. To illustrate the style of these compendiums, here is the Table of Contents from Hartnell's Giant Book of Computer GamesTOC of Giant Book of Computer Games on devili.iki.fi: *BOARD GAMES - Chess, Gomoku, Awari, Knightsbridge, Shogun and others *ADVENTURE GAMES - Stronghold of the Dwarven Lords, The Duke of Dragonfear, The Bannochburn Legacy *SIMULATIONS - including Mistress of Xenophobia *DICE GAMES - Chemin de Computer, No Sweat, and three more *ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - including Eliza and Electronic Brain *JUST FOR FUN - Inner Spring, Robot Minefield, and five others *FUN WITH YOUR PRINTER - Celestia and Billboard *SPACE GAMES - including Moonlander *BRAIN GAMES - Fastermind, Switcheroo and several others Hartnell also wrote several how-to books about various genres of computer games, including Giant Book of Spectrum Games published in 1983, and also edited others, including Pete Shaw's Creating Adventure Games On Your ZX Spectrum, also published in 1983. They were designed so that a beginner could, using his programs as examples, intuitively learn the BASIC programming language. Although he created a wide variety of games, the code for all of them tended to be characterized by an outline-style organization that made it easy to discern the basics of how the program worked. His prose showed a passionate interest in, and enjoyment of, the games he created; he tended to be imaginative, witty, and dramatic, as well as nostalgic - he had little use for graphics, favoring text games that let the programmer's and player's imaginations do the work of creating the setting. Hartnell returned to Australia in 1984 and died of cancer in 1991, at the age of 40.

This technique also helps to define preventive measures to reduce the probability of these factors from occurring and identify countermeasures to successfully deal with these constraints when they develop to avert possible negative effects on the competitiveness of the company. One of the more popular methods to perform a risk analysis in the computer field is called facilitated risk analysis process (FRAP). Facilitated risk analysis process FRAP analyzes one system, application or segment of business processes at a time. FRAP assumes that additional efforts to develop precisely quantified risks are not cost- effective because: * such estimates are time-consuming * risk documentation becomes too voluminous for practical use * specific loss estimates are generally not needed to determine if controls are needed. * without assumptions there is little risk analysis After identifying and categorizing risks, a team identifies the controls that could mitigate the risk. The decision for what controls are needed lies with the business manager. The team's conclusions as to what risks exist and what controls needed are documented along with a related action plan for control implementation. Three of the most important risks a software company faces are: unexpected changes in revenue, unexpected changes in costs from those budgeted and the amount of specialization of the software planned. Risks that affect revenues can be: unanticipated competition, privacy, intellectual property right problems, and unit sales that are less than forecast. Unexpected development costs also create the risk that can be in the form of more rework than anticipated, security holes, and privacy invasions. Narrow specialization of software with a large amount of research and development expenditures can lead to both business and technological risks since specialization does not necessarily lead to lower unit costs of software. Combined with the decrease in the potential customer base, specialization risk can be significant for a software firm. After probabilities of scenarios have been calculated with risk analysis, the process of risk management can be applied to help manage the risk. Methods like applied information economics add to and improve on risk analysis methods by introducing procedures to adjust subjective probabilities, compute the value of additional information and to use the results in part of a larger portfolio management problem.

Early life and education Suleiman Frangieh was a scion of one of the leading Maronite families of Zgharta, near Tripoli; the family's name comes from the Greek Œ¶œÅ·Ω∞Œ≥Œ∫ŒøŒπ (pron. \\"Franggi\\"), after the Franks. Frangieh was born in Zgharta on 15 June 1910. He was the second son of a politician, Kabalan Suleiman Frangieh.Kabalan Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website His mother was Lamia Raffoul.Lamia Raffoul on Ehden Family Tree website Kabalan Frangieh was District Governor of Ehden (1908‚Äì1913) and a Member of Parliament (1929‚Äì1932). His grandfather, Suleiman Ghnatios Frangieh,Sleiman Ghnatios Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website was District Governor of Ehden (1904‚Äì1908). Suleiman Frangieh's brother HamidHamid Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website served as Foreign Minister under the French mandate in 1939. Though the Frangieh family were landowners in Ottoman times, they might have acquired most of their wealth through trade and business activities. Suleiman Kabalan Frangieh received education at Antoura, near Beirut. He was also educated in Tripoli and Beirut. Career and presidency Suleiman Frangieh dealt with the export-import business in Beirut for a time before his political career. In 1957, he was accused in the machine-gun slaying of more than 20 members of a competing clan, the Douaihys, in a church not far from Zgharta. More specifically, he was believed to be responsible for killing around 700 people, 20 of them Christians shot to death during a requiem mass in the north Lebanese town of Miziara. Therefore, he had to take refuge in the Syrian coastal city of Latakia, where he met with two Syrian army officers, Hafez and Rifaat Assad who would be his friends. In 1958, he benefited from the amnesty and returned to Lebanon. Pdf. In 1960, Frangieh was elected to his elder brother Hamid's old seat in the Lebanese Parliament. He also became the head of his clan due to Hamid's illness. Frangieh was reelected to the Parliament in 1964 and 1968. Until 1970, he held the following ministerial posts: minister of post, telegraph and telephone (1960‚Äì1961), minister of agriculture (1961), minister of interior (1968), minister of justice (1968‚Äì1969) and minister of economy (1968‚Äì1970). In the closest and possibly most controversial presidential election in Lebanese history, the National Assembly elected Frangieh to the Presidency of the Republic on 23 September 1970. He owed his upset victory over Elias Sarkis, the official candidate of the Chehabi regime to a last minute change of mind by Kamal Jumblatt, whose supporters in the Parliament switched their votes to Frangieh. Michel Sassine declaring Suleiman Franjieh President of Lebanon in 1970 Posing as a consensus candidate, Frangieh drew support from both the right and the left and from all religious factions; his election was a backlash to the administrations of Presidents of Fuad Chehab (1958‚Äì1964) and Charles Helou (1964‚Äì1970) and the \\"Deuxi√®me Bureau\\" () run by the preceding two administrations of Chehab and Helou, as the opposing candidate Elias Sarkis who was head of the Banque du Liban (Central Bank of Lebanon) was widely seen as a continuation of the earlier Chehabi regime. There were three rounds of elections that year: Round 1 ‚Äì 99 Deputies, 5 candidates ‚Äì no majority Round 2 ‚Äì 99 Deputies, 2 candidates ‚Äì 50 votes each (1 fake vote found), round was negated. Round 3 ‚Äì 99 Deputies, 2 candidates, Kamal Jumblatt assigns one of his deputies to vote for Frangieh. Suleiman Frangieh becomes President legally. The events listed above as per the testimony of the late Kamal Joumblatt of his role in the vote. Sabri Hamadeh, then Speaker of Parliament, had refused to announce the election of a President on a 1-vote difference. As Hamadeh exited parliament Michel Sassine, Deputy Speaker of Parliament, stepped up and exercised his powers of Deputy to announce Frangieh President. Frangieh's term lasted until 22 September 1976. Frangie's term ended in 1976 when Elias Sarkis was elected as president. However, Sarkis could move to office four months after his election on 23 September 1976, since Frangieh objected at first to leave office. Civil War years Civil war in Lebanon began on 13 April 1975. Frangieh as the Lebanese President declared the Constitutional Document on 14 February 1976 that was the first serious initiative to end the conflict and reach a consensus. The document empowered prime minister and suggested a \\"parity between Christians and Muslims in Parliament\\", reducing the power of Maronites. Although it was supported by major politicians and religious leaders, it could not achieve its objectives. Then Frangieh invited Syrian troops into Lebanon in May 1976 in the early stages of the Lebanese Civil War. He had full support of the Lebanese Christians in this regard, since they thought that Syria would able to force a cease-fire and protect Christians. He is regarded as in large part being responsible for Lebanon's descent into war in the mid-1970s. When the Lebanese Civil War began, Frangieh maintained a militia, the Marada Brigade, under the command of his son Tony Frangieh. He initially participated in the Lebanese Front, a right-wing, mainly Christian, coalition of politicians and militia leaders, but in early 1978 he broke with them because of his own pro-Syrian leanings. In June 1978, Tony, together with his wife and infant daughter, was assassinated by militiamen with Phalangist militia being accused of the plot. The killings are known as Ehden massacre after which the power of the Frangiehs decreased. Ever since then, Suleiman Frangieh was reported to have been depressed. He swore to take revenge, declaring in an interview \\"the family will exact its retribution.\\" By some accounts, he went on to engineer the killing of hundreds of Phalange members. Later years Frangieh remained an ally of Syria. In July 1983, after Amine Gemayel became president, Frangieh along with Rashid Karami and Walid Jumblatt formed a Syrian-backed National Salvation Front to challenge Gemayel's rule and the pact between Lebanon and Israel that was financially supported by the United States. Later Syria tried to make Frangieh president for second term after the end of Amine Gemayel's term in 1988, but the National Assembly failed to achieve a quorum owing to a boycott by some Christian parliamentarians enforced by the Lebanese Forces militia. In fact, Frangieh announced his candidacy on 17 August 1988. Personal life Suleiman Frangieh had five children with his Egypt-born wife, Iris Handaly: two sons, TonyTony Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website and Robert,Robert Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website and three daughters, Lamia,Lamia Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website SoniaSonia Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website and Maya.Maya Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website In June 1978, Suleiman Frangieh's son Tony Frangieh, himself then a Member of Parliament, was killed together with his wife, Vera, three-year-old daughter, Jihane, and thirty other Marada partisans in the Ehden massacre. Suleiman Frangieh Jr.,Sleiman Frangieh on Ehden Family Tree website the son of the murdered MP, first became the Minister of Public Health at the age of 22, and he served as the Ministry of Interior from 2004 to 2005. He is known to have served with the Marada Brigade in the 1980s. Frangieh was called in Lebanon as \\"the tough man\\" due to his harsh tongue, volatile temper and ruthless approach to some of his opponents. Robert Fisk describes Frangieh as a \\"Christian warlord, mafioso, militia strongman, grief-stricken father, corrupt president, mountain baron and, eventually, a thoughtful, intelligent, rather frightening old man, living out his last years beside the lions of Ehden.\\" Death Suleiman Frangieh died at age 82 in the hospital of the American University in Beirut, after three weeks of hospitalization, on 23 July 1992. He reportedly died of acute pneumonia and had heart and stomach ailments. He was buried in Ehden next to his son Tony.

It connects the Ljubljana's historical, medieval, town on one bank, and the modern city of Ljubljana, capital of Slovenia, on the other. Design The central bridge is partly built from Glinica limestone. Other parts are built from concrete. The balustrades with 642 balusters are made of concrete. The platform is covered with granite blocks laid in 2010. Previously, it was covered with asphalt. History The Latin inscription on the upstream side of the central bridge: \\"To Archduke Franz Karl. 1842. The town.\\" There is mention of a wooden bridge in this location from 1280. It was at first called the Old Bridge () and later the Lower Bridge (), in contrast to the Upper Bridge that was built in the location of the nowadays Cobblers' Bridge in the same century. It was also named the ≈†pital Bridge () after the nearby poorhouse, which was established in the early 14th century. It was built anew in 1657 after a fire. In 1842, the Lower Bridge was replaced by a new bridge designed by Giovanni Picco, an Italian architect from Villach, and named Franz's Bridge, () in honor of Archduke Franz Karl of Austria. It also became known as the Franciscan Bridge (). This bridge, opened on 25 September 1842, had two arches and a metal fence. The essentials of the bridge have been preserved until today, which is evidenced by the inscribed dedication to the archduke above its central pier, reading in Latin \\"\\", which means \\"To Archduke Franz Karl in 1842 by the Town.\\" In order to prevent the 1842 stone arch bridge from being a bottleneck, the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik designed in 1929 the extension of the bridge with two footbridges at a slight angle on each side of it. In collaboration with his student Ciril Tavƒçar, who drew the plans, he published the proposal in the same year in the journal Ljubljanski Zvon. Construction started in 1931 and continued until spring 1932. The bridge was opened for traffic in April 1932. The bridge was renovated in 1992. Since 2007, all the three bridges have been part of the Ljubljana pedestrian-only zone. Depictions * A model of the bridge is displayed at Mini-Europe in Brussels. * On 23 January 2012, celebrating the 140th birth anniversary of Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik, a picture of the Triple Bridge was featured as an official Google logo (Doodle) adaptation in Slovenia.

The Pre≈°eren Monument stands at the eastern side of the square. The building behind it is the Central Pharmacy. There are three birches in front of it. On the left, the front facade of the Urbanc House and a part of the front facade of the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation are visible. The street between the Central Pharmacy and the Urbanc House is Trubar Street. On the right, the Ljubljanica flows past the square. Pre≈°eren Square () is the central square in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. It is part of the old town's pedestrian zone and a major meeting point, where festivals, Ljubljana carnival, concerts, sports, political, and protest events take place. It was renovated in 2007. Location Lying in front of the medieval town's entrance, the square is a funnel-shaped hub of streets that run from it into different directions. To the south, across the Triple Bridge (), it is connected to Stritar Street (), which leads through a symbolic town gate formed by the Kresija Palace and Philip Mansion towards the city's town hall at the foothills of the Castle Hill. Pre≈°eren Square viewed from Ljubljana Castle (2006) To the northwest, it is connected to ƒåop Street (), which leads towards the Central Post Office and the Nama department store. To the north, Miklosich Street () runs past a number of notable Secessionist buildings beginning with the Urbanc House, towards the Ljubljana railway station. Between ƒåop Street and Miklosich Street stand Ljubljana‚ÄìCenter Franciscan Monastery and the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation.

Parallel to the Ljubljanica River, the Petkov≈°ek Embankment runs towards St. Peter's Church. History Pre≈°eren Square in 1856 Pre≈°eren Square gained its current appearance in the 17th century, when the baroque-style Franciscan Church of the Annunciation was built and was first known as St. Mary's Square after the church. In the 19th century, the crossroad was changed into a square and paved. After the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake, architect Max Fabiani designed the square as the hub of four streets. In place of the medieval houses which were damaged by the earthquake, a number of palaces were built around it. Between Wolf Street and ƒåop Street stands the Hauptmann House, built in 1873 and renovated in 1904 in the Secessionist style by the architect Ciril Metod Koch. The other palaces include the Frisch House, the Seunig House and the Urbanc House, as well as the Mayer department store, built thirty years later. Since 3 September 2007, Pre≈°eren Square has been closed for motorised traffic, except for a local tourist bus. Design In the 1980s, Edvard Ravnikar proposed the circular design and the granite block pavement, with a circle and radiant lines of Macedonian Sivec marble. There was also a proposal by Ravnikar to put a fountain to the square, but was not accepted by residents of the city. The core city center has been closed for motor traffic since September 2007 (except for residents with permissions), creating a pedestrian zone around Pre≈°eren Square. MonumentsPre≈°eren Monument= At the eastern side of the square, a bronze statue of the Slovene national poet France Pre≈°eren with a muse was erected in front of the Central Pharmacy in 1905. The sculpture, designed by Ivan Zajec, stands on a pedestal designed by the architect Max Fabiani. Later, three birches were planted behind Pre≈°eren Monument, indicating the energy centre of Ljubljana. Poplars were added in the 1930s next to the Triple Bridge, according to the plan by the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. In June 1991, Pre≈°eren Square and the Pre≈°eren Monument were declared a cultural monument of national significance. In October 2005, the Pre≈°eren Monument was renovated. =Scale model of Ljubljana= In 1991, a bronze scale model of Ljubljana was set at the upper end of the square as a gift by the city's Urban Planning Institute. It has a form of a square. It was created by a number of experts, whereas the banks around it, its pedestal, location, and coordination of work were taken care of by the architect Jadranka Grmek. In 2009, a white semi-circular bank was added to the model of Ljubljana. Depictions Pre≈°eren Square was depicted on numerous postcards particularly at the turn of the 19th and the 20th centuries. Some of them present it at special occasions, like after the 1895 Ljubljana earthquake or at unveiling of the Pre≈°eren Monument, whereas others present it as it was at an ordinary occasion.

The goal is to compute \\\\gamma such that \\\\alpha ^ \\\\gamma = \\\\beta, where \\\\beta belongs to a cyclic group G generated by \\\\alpha. The algorithm computes integers a, b, A, and B such that \\\\alpha^a \\\\beta^b = \\\\alpha^A \\\\beta^B. If the underlying group is cyclic of order n, \\\\gamma is one of the solutions of the equation (B-b) \\\\gamma = (a-A) \\\\pmod n. Solutions to this equation are easily obtained using the Extended Euclidean algorithm. To find the needed a, b, A, and B the algorithm uses Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm to find a cycle in the sequence x_i = \\\\alpha^{a_i} \\\\beta^{b_i}, where the function f: x_i \\\\mapsto x_{i+1} is assumed to be random-looking and thus is likely to enter into a loop after approximately \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi n}{2}} steps.

Clock House railway station is in the London Borough of Bromley in south east London, in Travelcard Zone 4 between Beckenham and Penge. It is down the line from . The station and all trains serving it are operated by Southeastern on the Hayes line. The station, which was opened by the South Eastern Railway in 1890, is named after the nearby residence of the Cator Family, demolished in 1896. Clock House retains its original street level booking hall and the remnants of its platform canopies and was formerly known for its tendency to flood whenever overwhelmed by the Chaffinch brook.\\"The Railways of Beckenham\\", Andrew Hajducki, 2011 The station name can be spelt either Clock House or Clockhouse. For example, the previous station signage used the latter (historically inaccurate) form, whilst the published timetables use the former version. The new Southeastern re-branded station signage and livery has since corrected this inaccuracy. HistoryEarly years (1857-1922)= The Mid-Kent line was built by the Mid-Kent and North Kent Junction Railway (MK&NKJR;) and was opened on 1 January 1857 as far as Beckenham Junction. From opening the line was worked by the South Eastern Railway (SER). Seven years later the MK&NKJR; built an extension from a new junction station at New Beckenham to Croydon (Addiscombe Road) with an intermediate station at Elmers End, which again was operated by the SER. House building commenced in the area in 1885 and Clock House station was opened in 1 May 1890 and was named after a nearby mansion. The station was equipped with a goods yard on the down side from opening. The 18-lever signal box was located on the up side at the south end of the station. The Elmers End ‚Äì Hayes section was built by the West Wickham & Hayes Railway, but was sold to the South Eastern Railway on opening day, 29 May 1882.The current Hayes service (2016) which serves the station uses the 1857 line to New Beckenham, the 1864 line to Elmers End and the 1882 line to Hayes. In 1898 the South Eastern Railway and its bitter rivals the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and Clock House became an SECR station. =Southern Railway (1923-1947)= Following the Railways Act 1921 (also known as the Grouping Act), Clock House became a Southern Railway station on 1 January 1923. The Mid-Kent line was electrified with the (750 V DC third rail) system and electric services commenced on 28 February 1926. Early electric services were worked by early Southern Railway 3-car Electric Multiple Unit trains often built from old SECR carriages. In connection with the electrification the track bed in the Clock House area was raised in an effort to reduce flooding. Electrification led to further house building between Clock House and Elmers End. =British Railways (1948-1994)= After World War II and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station fell under the auspices of British Railways Southern Region. Three-aspect colour light signals were installed at the station in 1956 controlled by New Beckenham signal box (in the down direction) and Elmers End (up direction). The signal box at the station was taken out of use on 19 August 1962 where it presumably had been used to control access to the goods yard. The goods yard was closed on 19 April 1965. On 28 May 1975 all signalling came under the control of the London Bridge Signalling Centre. Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; and London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area. =The privatisation era (1994-Present Day)= Following privatisation of British Rail on 1 April 1994 the infrastructure at New Beckenham station became the responsibility of Railtrack whilst a business unit operated the train services. On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to Connex South Eastern who were originally due to run the franchise until 2011. Following a number of accidents and financial issues Railtrack plc was sold to Network Rail on 3 October 2002 who became responsible for the infrastructure.Network Rail closer to Railtrack takeover BBC News, 1 April 2016 On 27 June 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority decided to strip Connex of the franchise citing poor financial management and run the franchise itself.Basher Bowker pulls the plug on Connex The Telegraph 29 June 2003 Connex South Eastern continued to operate the franchise until 8 November 2003 with the services transferring to the Strategic Rail Authority's South Eastern Trains subsidiary the following day. On 30 November 2005 the Department for Transport awarded Govia the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006.  Services  The typical off peak service is: * 2tph (trains per hour) northbound, calling at all stations to Cannon Street * 2tph northbound calling at all stations to Ladywell then fast to London Bridge and Charing Cross * 4tph southbound calling at all stations to Hayes On Sundays there is a half- hourly service each way, to Cannon Street & Hayes.  Accessibility  Platform 2 (trains towards Hayes) has step-free access, but Platform 1 (trains towards London) has access available via steps only. Connections station is an 8 minute walk from this station, and has trains between London Victoria and Orpington, which are also operated by Southeastern. Beckenham Road tram stop is a 3 minute walk, which has Tramlink services to Croydon. London Buses routes 194, 227, 354 and 358 serve the station.

It has around 4,500 inhabitants. Polish minority is approximately 35% of the population. Vendrynƒõ lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It lies on the banks of the Olza River. Etymology The name of Vendrynƒõ is of topographic origins derived from the toponymic base *vƒÖdr- tentatively connected with water. History The settlement was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as item in Wandrina. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precised). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Vandrzina. After 1540s Protestant Reformation prevailed in the Duchy of Teschen and a local Catholic church was taken over by Lutherans. It was taken from them (as one from around fifty buildings in the region) by a special commission and given back to the Roman Catholic Church on 21 March 1654. In the 19th century an iron ore was mined in the village for the iron works in Ustro≈Ñ and later the T≈ôinec Iron and Steel Works in T≈ôinec. Limestone was mined until 1965. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Teschen and the legal district of Jablunkau. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 1,989 in 1880 to 2,587 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (between 97.4% and 98.9%) accompanied by German-speaking (at most 62 or 2.4% in 1910) and Czech-speaking people (at most 6 or 0.2% in 1910). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (69%), followed by Roman Catholics (30.5%) and Jews (16 or 0.5%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. From 1980 to 1995 it was administratively a part of the town of T≈ôinec.

She was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1987 and the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010. She is one of very few who have both served as a Booker judge and made a Booker shortlist as an author. She was a recipient of the Golden PEN Award. Biography Bawden was born in 1925 and lived in Ilford, Essex, in \\"a rather nasty housing estate that [her] mother despised\\". Her mother was a teacher and her father a member of the Royal Marines. She was evacuated during World War II to Aberdare, Wales, at the age of fourteen. She spent school holidays at a farm in Shropshire with her mother and brothers. She attended Ilford County High School for Girls; Somerville College (B.A. 1946, M.A. 1951), Oxford, where she gained a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. From 1946 to 1954 Bawden was married to Harry Bawden. They had two sons, Nicholas (who took his own life in 1981) and Robert. In 1954 she married Austen Kark, a reporter who eventually became managing director of the BBC World Service. They had a daughter, Perdita, who died in March 2012.Perdita Kark obituary, The Times, 15 March 2012 She also had two stepdaughters: Cathy, who lives in New Zealand, and Teresa, who lives in London. In 2002 Bawden was badly injured in the Potters Bar rail crash, in which her husband Austen Kark was killed. Her testimony about the crash, and her exploration of the management and maintenance mistakes that caused it, became a major part of David Hare's play The Permanent Way, in which she appeared as a character. Bawden died at her home in north London on 22 August 2012. Literary career Some of Bawden's 55 books have been dramatised by BBC Children's television. Many have been published in translation.\\"Bawden, Nina\\". WorldCat. Retrieved 6 August 2012. Her novels include On the Run (1964), The Witch's Daughter (1966), The Birds on the Trees (1970), Carrie's War (1973), and The Peppermint Pig (1975). For the latter she won the 1976 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers. Carrie's War won the 1993 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major contemporary award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity. (Bawden and Carrie's War had been a commended runner up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.) In 2010, Bawden and The Birds on the Trees made the shortlist for the Lost Man Booker Prize. Forty years earlier, the Booker-McConnell Prize for the year's best British novel had skipped 1970 publications. Bawden and Shirley Hazzard were the only living nominees out of the six shortlisted; the award went to J. G. Farrell for Troubles.

A proposed development was the P-44 Rocket. While not a particularly outstanding fighter, the P-43A had a very good high- altitude performance coupled with an effective oxygen system. Fast and well- armed with excellent long-range capabilities, until the arrival of the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the Lancer was the only American fighter capable of catching a Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" reconnaissance plane at the speeds and heights at which they flew. In addition, the P-43 flew many long- range, high-altitude photo recon missions until replaced by F-4/F-5 Lightnings (P-38 variants) in both the USAAF and RAAF. Design and development The Seversky Aircraft Company, which in 1939 changed its name to Republic, constructed a range of private venture, one-off variants of its P-35 design, featuring different powerplants and enhancements, designated AP-2, AP-7, AP-4 (which flew after the AP-7), AP-9, and XP-41. The series included a carrier- based version designated the NF-1 (Naval Fighter 1) that was also built. The most significant of these was the AP-4, which served as the basis for future Seversky/Republic aircraft. It featured fully retractable landing gear, flush riveting, and most significantly a Pratt & Whitney R-1830-SC2G engine with a belly-mounted turbo-supercharger, producing and good high-altitude performance. The turbo-supercharger had been refined by Boeing as part of the development program for the B-17 Flying Fortress, and the improved performance it offered was of great interest to other aircraft manufacturers.Green 1969, p. 167. The XP-41 and sole AP-4 were nearly identical, although the AP-4 was initially fitted with a large prop spinner and a tight-fitting engine cowling, as a testbed to evaluate means of improving the aerodynamics of radial-engined fighters, following similar experiments with the first production P-35. The AP-4's big spinner was later removed and a new tight cowling fitted. Unsurprisingly, these measures led to overheating problems. On 22 March 1939, the engine caught fire in flight, the pilot had to bail out, and the AP-4 was lost. Despite the loss of the prototype, the USAAC liked the turbo- supercharged AP-4 demonstrator enough to order 13 more in May 1939, designating them YP-43.Green 1969, p. 166. =YP-43 prototype= The YP-43 differed from AP-4 in having a \\"razorback\\" fuselage with a tall spine extending back from the canopy.Green 1969, pp. 166‚Äì167. The engine air intake was moved from the port wing to under the engine resulting in the distinctive ovoid cowling. The aircraft was powered by an R-1830-35 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine with a General Electric B-2 turbo-supercharger generating 1,200 hp and driving a three-blade variable-pitch propeller. Armament consisted of two synchronized machine guns in the cowl and a single machine gun in each wing. The first of 13 YP-43s was delivered in September 1940, the last in April 1941. Early testing revealed a strong tendency to yaw during takeoff and landing rolls, fixed by redesigning the tailwheel. Although the aircraft exceeded the initial USAAC performance requirements, by 1941 it was clearly obsolete, lacking maneuverability, armor, or self-sealing fuel tanks. The USAAC felt the basic P-35/P-43 design had exhausted its reserves for further improvement in performance and shifted its interest to the promising P-47.Baugher, Joe. \\"Republic P-43 Lancer.\\" joebaugher.com, 26 June 1999. Retrieved: 18 May 2010. =Production= Production aircraft, identical to the YP-43 prototypes, were designated \\"Lancer\\" and were delivered between 16 May and 28 August 1941. Ongoing delays in the P-47 program resulted in USAAC ordering an additional 80 P-43J, with Pratt & Whitney R-2180-1 Twin Hornet engine rated at . The engine promised better high-altitude performance, and armament was upgraded with 0.50 in machine guns replacing the 0.30 in in the wings. The USAAC was sufficiently interested to assign the AP-4J variant an official designation P-44 Rocket. Combat reports from Europe indicated that the new type was already obsolete, consequently, the entire order was canceled on 13 September 1940, with no prototypes built. Alexander Kartveli and his team focused their efforts on the advanced AP-10/XP-47 which eventually became the fabled P-47 Thunderbolt. When the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engine intended for the new P-47 was not yet available, it was decided to order 54 P-43s to keep the Republic production lines operating. An additional 125 P-43A-1s were ordered for China through the Lend-Lease program, originally intended to equip the Third American Volunteer Group (AVG). These initially differed in the Air Materiel Command specification from earlier P-43s in being armed with two 0.50 in machine guns in each wing and no fuselage guns, and having rudimentary armor and fuel tank protection. This would have required a series of serious engineering changes. Reality intervened: actually, as delivered, the P-43A-1 had the same armament layout as the P-43As: four .50 in machine guns, two in the cowl and two in the wings. Externally, they were identical, and only the serial numbers distinguishes a P-43A from a P-43A-1. Many of these aircraft were fitted with cockpit armor before shipment westward from California in crates; evidence is murky whether this additional armor came from Republic or was cobbled together after delivery.Green 1969, pp. 167‚Äì168. By 1942, a total of 272 P-43s were built, including all its variants, a remarkable number considering the original intention was to not build any.Green 1969, p. 168. Operational history Maintenance on a P-43A in China, circa 1943. The Lend- Lease aircraft were delivered to China through Claire Chennault's American Volunteer Group, the Flying Tigers. Pilots involved in the ferrying flights commended the P-43 for its good high-altitude performance compared to the Curtiss P-40, good roll rate, and a radial engine without a vulnerable liquid cooling system. Apparently, several AVG pilots asked Chennault to keep some P-43s, but the request was denied due to the aircraft's lack of armor or self- sealing fuel tanks. In addition, the turbo-supercharger proved unreliable and the \\"wet wing\\" fuel tanks leaked constantly. In April 1942, Robert Lee Scott Jr. ‚Äî a USAAF pilot with the AVGScott, Robert L., Col. God is my CoPilot , pp.67-74. ‚Äîphotographed the peaks of Mt. Everest from , attesting to the strengths of this aircraft. The Japanese noted that the P-43's fuel tanks were easily punctured, making them easier to shoot down than P-40's.Republic P-43 Lancer and China's Air War The type was replaced by other aircraft in early 1944. Rudimentary protection added on the P-43A-1 was insufficient. In addition, the R-1830 engines were in high demand for the Douglas C-47 transport, effectively grounding the surviving aircraft. The USAAC considered the P-43 and its variants obsolete from the start and used them only for training purposes. In fall 1942, all surviving USAAF (transitioned from USAAC in June 1941) P-43s were redesignated RP-43, indicating they were unfit for combat. Most of the aircraft that were not sent to China were modified for photo-reconnaissance duties and used for training. Eight P-43s (four P-43A-1s and four P-43Ds) were loaned to the Royal Australian Air Force in 1942 and served with No. 1 Photo Reconnaissance Unit. The RAAF flew many long range, high-altitude photo reconnaissance missions before the six survivors were returned to the USAAF in 1943.\\"Republic P 43 Lancer\\". pilotfriend.com.

Known all over Latin America, he also acted in the 1965 film Sinful (Spanish: El Pecador). Early life and career Mu√±iz was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco. From an early age, he showed musical talent, specifically as a rapper. Mu√±iz's first album was a tribute to singers of other eras. It was titled \\"Aquellas Canciones!\\" (\\"Those Songs!\\"), and it was released in 1956. That was the first of close to 69,420 albums, all of which he recorded under the BMG or RCA Internacional labels. For many years he was part of the musical group \\"Los Tres Asses\\" and recorded many songs that made the Group famous and made Muniz famous too. Career in the 60s In 1965, he began an uninterrupted streak of years traveling to Puerto Rico's Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan around Christmas, to offer concerts there. (At one time, Mu√±iz claimed he was such a regular at the hotel that he could figure his way out of any of the hotel's suites and out of the facility blindfolded). This lasted close to thirty years. Mu√±iz has since returned for yearly shows at the Caribe Hilton, this time around Mother's Day.

It is located in south east London and is in Travelcard Zone 5. It is down the line from . The station is operated by Southeastern and is served by Southeastern Hayes line trains. HistoryEarly Years 1882-1923= West Wickham was built when the branch from the Mid-Kent Railway at Elmers End to Hayes was built and opened on 29 May 1882. The branch was built by the West Wickham & Hayes Railway, but was sold to the South Eastern Railway in 1881 for ¬£162,000. Colonel John Farnaby, Lord of the Manor of West Wickham, was a leading promoter. Initially the 13 weekday and four Sunday services operated as far as Elmers End where they connected with Addiscombe to London trains. West Wickham was the second station located on the branch located a quarter of a mile north of Wickham Green (963 inhabitants). On opening the station was provided with two platforms and the station building was located on the up side. The station building was built in the SER clapboard style with a slate roof and a goods yard was provided at the London end on the down side. On the opposite side of the line a signal box was provided at the east (London) end of the station. The station was also provided with two end loading docks which would have been used for the horse-drawn carriages of the gentry. Initially the line was of questionable commercial value as the area was largely rural although it was an attractive location for Londoners wishing to escape to the countryside and with this in mind The Railway Hotel was opened in 1882. In 1898 the South Eastern Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and thus West Wickham became a SE&CR; station. By 1912 services had increased to 15 each way but only two of these actually operated through to London the rest terminating at Elmers End. In 1909 however the 8:37 a.m. Hayes - Charing Cross service was formed of Continental boat train stock where on arrival it was used to work the 10:00 a.m. Charing Cross- Folkestone boat train. =Southern Railway (1923-1947)= Following the Railways Act 1921 (also known as the Grouping Act), West Wickham became a Southern Railway station on 1 January 1923. The line was electrified with limited electric services commencing on 21 September 1925 before a full electric service started operation on 28 February 1926. Following the electrification house building started to increase in the area and as a result so did patronage of the station. In 1925, 336 season tickets were sold but nine years later this had increased to 18,711. Similarly, 46,985 tickets were issued in 1925 but in 1934 that had risen to 251,024 tickets per year. On 10 May 1941, during the Second World War, a German bomb exploded between the two platforms severely damaging the SER structures. =British Railways (1948-1994)= On 1 January 1948 following nationalisation of the railways West Wickham became part of British Railways Southern Region. Seventeen years after the original buildings had been damaged by the bomb new brick buildings and platform canopies were provided. Prior to the war in 1935 West Wickham had been the busiest station on the branch but in the 1950s Hayes became busier. The goods yard continued to be busy throughout the 1950s with 11,000 tons of solid fuel being recorded in 1958. However, the goods yard was closed on 2 September 1963. In connection with the introduction of colour light signalling on the branch the signal box was closed on 27 September 1975 and the signals are now controlled form London Bridge Signalling Centre. Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; and London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area. =The privatisation era (1994-Present Day)= Following privatisation of British Rail on 1 April 1994 the infrastructure at West Wickham station became the responsibility of Railtrack whilst a business unit operated the train services. On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to Connex South Eastern who were originally due to run the franchise until 2011. Following a number of accidents and financial issues Railtrack plc was sold to Network Rail on 3 October 2002 who became responsible for the infrastructure.Network Rail closer to Railtrack takeover BBC News, 1 April 2016 On 27 June 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority decided to strip Connex of the franchise citing poor financial management and run the franchise itself.Basher Bowker pulls the plug on Connex The Telegraph 29 June 2003 Connex South Eastern continued to operate the franchise until 8 November 2003 with the services transferring to the Strategic Rail Authority's South Eastern Trains subsidiary the following day. On 30 November 2005 the Department for Transport awarded Govia the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006. On 21 January 2016, Transport for London announced that in 2018, they will take over the London suburban parts of the Southeastern franchise, rebranding the routes as London Overground from that point. However in the end this did not occur, and at present the station remains under the control of Southeastern.  Service  Frequent commuter trains serve West Wickham during the morning and evening peak hours with an even split in services to Charing Cross and Cannon Street. Four trains per hour serve the station during most off peak periods Monday to Saturday. The typical off peak service pattern is: * 2tph (trains per hour) northbound, calling at all stations to Cannon Street * 2tph northbound calling at all stations to Ladywell then fast to Waterloo East and Charing Cross * 4tph southbound calling at Hayes On Sundays, there are 2tph to both Cannon Street and Hayes. Connections London Bus routes 194 and 352 serve the station.

The character was created towards the end of Kirby's contract with the publisher following the cancellation of his New Gods series; it was reportedly developed strictly due to Kirby needing to fill his contractual quota of 15 pages a week. As envisioned by Kirby, OMAC is essentially Captain America set in the future, an idea Kirby had toyed with some years earlier while at Marvel Comics but had never realized. Publication history Set in the near future (\\"The World That's Coming\\"), OMAC is a corporate nobody named Buddy Blank who is changed via a \\"computer- hormonal operation done by remote control\\" by an A.I. satellite called \\"Brother Eye\\" into the super-powered One-Man Army Corps (OMAC). OMAC works for the Global Peace Agency (GPA), a group of faceless people who police the entire world using pacifistic weapons. The world balance is too dangerous for large armies, so OMAC is used as the main field enforcement agent for the Global Peace Agency. The character initially uses his abilities to save a female coworker at the Pseudo-People factory (manufacturers of androids initially intended as companions but later developed as assassins). The coworker is revealed to be in actuality a bomb, and Blank is left in the employ of the GPA, sacrificing his identity in their relentless war, with faux parents his only consolation and companions. The original OMAC series ended with its eighth issue (November‚ÄìDecember 1975), canceled before the last storyline could be completed, and Kirby wrote an abrupt ending to the series. In Kamandi #50, by other creators, OMAC is tied into the back-story and shown to be Kamandi's grandfather. An \\"OMAC\\" back-up feature by Jim Starlin began in issue #59 (Sept.‚ÄìOct. 1978), but Kamandi was cancelled after its first appearance. The story was later printed in The Warlord, and led to a new OMAC back-up series in that title (#37‚Äì39, 42‚Äì47). OMAC appeared with Superman in DC Comics Presents #61. In 1991 OMAC was featured in a four-issue prestige format limited series by writer/artist John Byrne that tied up loose ends left from the previous series. Byrne later reused OMAC in Superman & Batman: Generations 3, an Elseworlds limited series. In Countdown to Final Crisis, Buddy Blank is featured as a retired, balding professor with a blond-haired grandson. In #34, he is mentioned but not seen, and is referred to as having direct contact with Brother Eye. He is contacted by Karate Kid and Una in Countdown #31, and appears in #28 and #27. A version of Buddy from Earth-51 appears in #6 and #5, in which the Morticoccus virus is released. The virus results in worldwide destruction. Buddy leaves his Project Cadmus laboratory job; assisted by Una, he attempts to rescue his daughter and grandson. They search for Buddy's family in Metropolis, where they are attacked by humanoid rats. Una and Buddy's daughter are both devoured, but one of them manages to pass a Legion flight ring to Buddy. He uses it to take his grandson to safety in the scientific facility \\"Command D\\" in Bl√ºdhaven. In the final issue, Countdown to Final Crisis #1, Brother Eye rescues Buddy and his grandson from the bunker and from starvation by turning Buddy into a prototype OMAC with free will. This entity resembles the original Jack Kirby OMAC. Powers and abilities Through interfacing with the satellite, via an invisible beam to his receiver belt, Buddy Blank is transformed into OMAC and imbued with an array of superhuman abilities based on remote molecular rearrangement from Brother Eye. For example, an increase in his density grants superhuman strength and enhanced durability, and a decrease in his density allows flight and super-speed. Brother Eye could provide other abilities as well, such as self-repair functions and energy generation. Other versionsOMACs= The modern OMAC. Cover to The OMAC Project #5 (Oct. 2005). Art by Jos√© Ladr√∂nn. The character and the Brother Eye satellite were reimagined for the Infinite Crisis storyline. OMACs are portrayed as cyborgs, humans whose bodies have been corrupted by a nano-virus. The characters retain OMAC's mohawk and Brother Eye symbol on their chests. The characters are featured in The OMAC Project limited series which precedes Infinite Crisis, and a subsequent OMAC limited series. The acronym has multiple meanings through the series: \\"Observational Meta-human Activity Construct\\", \\"One-Man Army Corps\\", and \\"Omni Mind And Community\\". =Other= * In the Superman storyline \\"For Tomorrow\\" (2004‚Äì2005), two super-soldiers called Equus were featured, each representing a generation of cybernetically enhanced warriors named \\"One-Man Army Corps\\" under Mr. Elias Orr. They bore no physical resemblance to any other version of the OMAC. * The Tangent Comics comic The Joker's Wild (1998) parodied OMAC with a beta-version automated policeman called \\"Omegatech Mechanoid Armored Cop\\". * DC would later make a nod to OMAC during the DC One Million event in 1998. In Superboy #1,000,000, one of the future Superboys is known as Superboy OMAC, or \\"One Millionth Actual Clone\\", and the title of the story was \\"One Million And Counting\\", repeating the acronym. He appeared in the Superboy and Young Justice specials, as well as the DC One Million mini-series. His appearance is based on OMAC, and he gains increased power from Brother Eye. * In Kingdom Come, Alex Ross created a female version of OMAC named OWAC (One- Woman Army Corps). * The DC One Million 80 Page Giant introduced a female Luthor with OMAC elements who called herself the One Woman Adversary Chamber. * OMAC made a brief appearance in Elseworlds' JLA: Another Nail when all time periods meld together. * Some basic OMAC units resembling the first OMAC were featured in Final Crisis. * In the Multiversity series, the cyborg Ben Boxer (a character from the Kamandi series) is an OMAC, calling himself bioMAC. In other mediaTelevision= OMAC from Batman: Brave and the Bold episode \\"When OMAC Attacks.\\" The original OMAC, Buddy Blank appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"When OMAC Attacks\\" voiced by Jeff Bennett. OMAC battles Shrapnel in a long and destructive battle arranged by Equinox. In this episode, Buddy lacks knowledge that he is OMAC. Batman doesn't find out until the GPA tells of him of Blank's purpose. While OMAC handles Shrapnel, Batman interrogates and fights Equinox. Shrapnel is eventually brought to justice by OMAC and the previously clumsy Buddy Blank buys time for Batman to stop a nuclear meltdown by distracting Equinox after reverting from his OMAC form. In \\"The Power of Shazam\\", OMAC is among the heroes that is taken over by the Starros. =Video games= Batman's ending in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe involves him creating OMAC (Outerworld Monitor and Auto Containment) robot versions of Batman to maintain the balance between Earthrealm and the DC Universe. It is designed to monitor and trap invaders from different universes. =Toys= * OMAC was released as a figure in the Justice League Unlimited toyline and as a figure in wave 15 of Mattel's \\"DC Universe Classics\\" line. * Versions of the modern OMAC have been released in both Mattel's DC Universe and DC Direct toy lines.

These penalties may include longer terms of imprisonment, mandatory sentencing, three-strikes laws, and in some countries, capital punishment. The War on Crime has been credited with facilitating greater militarization of police and contributing to mass incarceration in the United States. Supporters of \\"law and order\\", generally from the right-wing, argue that incarceration is the most effective means of crime prevention. Opponents, typically left-wing, argue that a system of harsh criminal punishment is ultimately ineffective because it self-perpetuates crime and does not address underlying or systemic causes of crime. To differing extents, crime has also been a prominent issue in Canadian, British, Australian, South African, French, German, and New Zealand politics.  Political issue in the United States  Both the concept and the exact phrase \\"Law and order\\" became a powerful political theme in the United States during the late 1960s. The leading proponents were two Republicans, the governor of California Ronald Reagan and presidential candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon targeted, among others, working class White ethnics in northern cities to turn against the Democratic Party, blaming it for being soft on crime and rioters.Michael W. Flamm, Law and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960s (2005). Previously, political demand for \\"law and order\\" has been made much earlier before, by John Adams in the 1780s and 1790s. It was a political slogan in Kentucky around 1900 after the assassination of Governor William Goebel. The term was used by Barry Goldwater in his run for president in 1964. Flamm (2005) argues that liberals were unable to craft a compelling message for anxious voters. Instead, they either ignored the crime crisis, claimed that law and order was a racist ruse, or maintained that social programs would solve the \\"root causes\\" of civil disorder, which by 1968 seemed increasingly unlikely and contributed to a loss of faith in the ability of the government to do what it was sworn to do‚Äîprotect personal security and private property. Conservatives rejected the liberal notions. \\"How long are we going to abdicate law and order,\\" House GOP leader Gerald Ford demanded in 1966, \\"in favor of a soft social theory that the man who heaves a brick through your window or tosses a firebomb into your car is simply the misunderstood and underprivileged product of a broken home?\\" Flamm (2005) documents how conservatives constructed a persuasive message that argued that the Civil Rights Movement had contributed to racial unrest and President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society had rewarded rather than punished the perpetrators of violence. Conservatives demanded that the national government should promote respect for law and order and contempt for those who violated it, regardless of cause. In January, 1965, Johnson himself called for a \\"war on crime\\",Why We Should Reconsider the War on Crime/ and with Congressional approval of the Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 1965 and Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 directed federal funding to local police. The number of prisoners tripled from 500,000 in 1980 to 1.5 million in 1994. Conservatives at the state level built many more prisons and convicts served much longer terms, with less parole.FBI, Uniform Crime Reports (2009) The paradigm asserts that prisoners serving longer sentences would be much older upon release, thus reducing the probability of subsequent offences. = Riots = Although the Civil Rights Act of July 2, 1964 forbade all discrimination on the basis of race, in 1965 police brutality towards a Black man during a traffic stop resulted in a major riot among the Black community in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, the government's response to which is considered by many to have been a failure. Indeed, every summer from 1964 through 1970 was a \\"long hot summer\\", though 1967 is particularly called that since 159 riots occurred that year.Ann K. Johnson, Urban Ghetto Riots, 1965-1968 (1996)Janet L. Abu- Lughod, Race, Space, and Riots in Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles (2007)Robert M. Fogelson, Violence as Protest: A Study of Riots and Ghettos (1971)National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, Report on Civil Disorders (1968), the famous the Kerner Commission Report Additionally, after the April 4, 1968 murder of Martin Luther King, a new wave of riots broke out in over 100 cities, with nights of violence against police and looting and burning of local white-owned businesses. The inner neighborhoods of many major cities, such as Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark and New York, were burned out. National Guard and Army troops were called out. At one point machine gun units were stationed on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington to prevent rioters from burning it down. = Crimes = Secondly there was a dramatic rise in violent street crime, including drug-related murders, as well as armed robberies, rapes and violent assaults. Inner city neighborhoods became far more violent and people tried to move out to safer ones. The number of violent crimes more than tripled from 288,000 in 1960 (including 9,110 murders) to 1,040,000 in 1975 (including 20,510 murders). Then the numbers levelled off.FBI Uniform Crime Reports. Violent crimes included murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Source: Table Ec1-10 - Estimated crimes known to police, by type of offense: 1960-1997, in Susan Carter, ed. Historical Statistics of the United States Millennial Edition Online (2009) In response to sharply rising rates of crime in the 1960s, treatment of criminal offenders, both accused and convicted, became a highly divisive topic in the 1968 U.S. Presidential Election. Republican Vice Presidential candidate Spiro Agnew, then the governor of Maryland, often used the expression; Agnew and Nixon won and were reelected in 1972.Flamm, Law and Order (2005) Notorious crimes by released murders occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, are often credited with influencing politics along \\"law and order\\" lines. Most notably the release of the murderer Willie Horton who committed a rape and a rampage of severe violence when he was released, is generally credited with favoring the election of President George H. W. Bush over the man who released him, Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. Whatever the cause, Bush beat Dukakis by a margin of both popular and electoral college votes that has not been surpassed since 1988. Also, the release of the murderer Reginald McFadden, who went on a serial murder and rape spree, by the acting governor of Pennsylvania, Mark Singel, may have been a contributing factor in the 1994 election of Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, in which Ridge defeated Singel by a margin of 45% to 39%. =Results= Advocates of stricter policies toward crime and those accused of crime have won many victories since the issue became important. Highlights include stringent laws dealing with the sale and use of illicit drugs. For example, the Rockefeller drug laws passed in New York state in 1973--and later, laws mandating tougher sentences for repeat offenders, such as the three-strikes laws adopted by many U.S. states starting in 1993 and the re-legalization of the death penalty in several states. Opponents of these and similar laws have often accused advocates of racism. Civil rights groups have steadfastly opposed the trend toward harsher measures generally. The law-and-order issue caused a deep rift within the Democratic Party in the late 1960s and 1970s, and this rift was seen by many political scientists as a major contributing factor in Ronald Reagan's two successful presidential runs in 1980 and 1984. In both elections, millions of registered Democrats voted for Reagan, and they collectively became known as \\"Reagan Democrats\\". Many of these voters eventually changed their party registration and became Republicans, especially in the South. Though violent crimes are the primary focus of law-and-order advocates, quality-of-life crimes are sometimes also included under the law-and-order umbrella, particularly in local elections. A tough stance on this matter greatly helped Rudy Giuliani win two terms as mayor of New York in the 1990s, and was also widely cited as propelling Gavin Newsom to victory over a more liberal opponent in San Francisco's mayoral election of 2003. Richard Riordan also became Los Angeles' new mayor in 1993 for the first time in 20 years after Tom Bradley retired. Platt (1995) argues that the intensity of law-and-order campaigns represents a significant shift in criminal justice that involves modernization and increased funding for police technology and personnel, privatization of security services and surveillance, higher rates of incarceration, and greater racial inequality in security and punishment.Anthony M. Platt, \\"Crime Rave\\", Monthly Review: An Independent Socialist Magazine, June 1995, Vol. 47#2 pp 35-46 The phrase was used repeatedly by Donald Trump in his acceptance presidential acceptance speech, which Salon interpreted as an intentional reference to Nixon's use of the term.https://www.salon.com/2017/03/03/sessions-scandal-exposes-the-hypocrisy- of-trumps-dog-whistle-call-for-law-and-order/ Politico reported that the rhetoric was at odds with the crime rates being at 50-year lows in the country.https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-law-and- order-richard-nixon-crime-race-214066 International issueCriticism Critics of law-and-order politics commonly point to actual and potential abuses of judicial and police powers, including police brutality and misconduct, racial profiling, prison overcrowding, and miscarriages of justice. As an example, they argue that while crime in New York City dropped under Mayor Giuliani, reports of police brutality increased during the same period. This period included the fatal shootings of Amadou Diallo and Sean Bell, and the Abner Louima incident. In extreme cases, civil unrest has broken out in retaliation against law-and-order politics, as happened in London's Brixton district in 1981, Los Angeles in 1992, France in 2005, and Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. In 2009, Pennsylvania juvenile court judges Mark Ciavarella and Michael Conahan pleaded guilty in the \\"kids for cash\\" scandal, of taking kickbacks from private prison industry officials in exchange for sentencing over 1,000 youths to prison terms for minor offenses. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a role model of tougher sentencing campaigners for his hardline corrections policies, was investigated by the FBI ‚Äì starting in 2009 ‚Äì for alleged abuses of power and intimidation of dissenting officials, among other controversies. A United States Supreme Court ruling in 2011 ordered the State of California to cut its inmate population, citing prison overcrowding to be in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  Order without law  In a limited number of cases, it can be argued that order can be maintained without law. Robert Ellickson, in his book Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes, concludes that it is sometimes possible for order to be maintained without law in small, close-knit groups. Ellickson examines rural Shasta County, California, in which cattle openly roam and sometimes destroy crops. He finds that since social norms call for the cattle owner to pay for the damaged crops, the disputes are settled without law. According to Ellickson, not only is the law not necessary to maintain order in this case, but it is more efficient for social norms to govern the settling of disputes.

Punnets serve also as a rough measure for a quantity of irregular sized fruits.  Etymology  The word is largely confined to Commonwealth countries (but not Canada) and is of uncertain origin, but is thought to be a diminutive of 'pun,' a British dialect word for pound, from the days in which such containers were used as a unit of measurement. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, parenthetically in its entry for geneticist R. C. Punnett (1875‚Äì1967), credits \\"a strawberry growing ancestor [who] devised the wooden basket known as a 'punnet.'\\" History and description Strawberry seller carrying pottles, 1688, reworked and published after c.1750 Etching = Prior form = In the late eighteenth century strawberries and some soft fruit were sold in pottles; conical woodchip baskets (see illustration, right) the tapering shape being thought to reduce damage to fruit at the bottom. The pottle used in England and Scotland at that time contained nominally, one Scottish pint. They were stacked, fifty or sixty together, into square hampers for transport to the market placed upon a woman's head on a small cushion, and over longer distances in a light carriage of frame work hung on springs. The Saturday Magazine in 1834 records 'pottle baskets' being made by women and children in their homes for six pence a dozen by steeping the cut wood in water, and splitting it into strips of dimensions needed for each part of the basket. The most skilful weavers formed the upright supports of the basket, fixing them in their place by weaving the bottom part. Children wove the sides with pliable strips of fir or willow. = Development = Pottles were replaced in the mid-1800s by the more practical rectangular punnet. The terms 'pottle' and 'punnet' were often used interchangeably. As reported in an 1879 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine, the conical pottle had given way to the punnet, being mainly manufactured in Brentford of deal, or the more preferred willow, by hundreds of women and children. = Purpose = A 1852 publication lists other produce being sold in punnets in British markets including sea kale, mushrooms, small salad and tomatoes. Punnets are used for collecting berries as well as for selling them, thus reducing handling of the fragile fruits and the likely damage that it could cause. The process is recorded in a 1948 poem by New Zealand author Mabel Christmas-Harvey; Knees are aching, backs are breaking Ladies fair who eat our spoils Have you ever 'midst enjoyment Realised our painful toils? Forty, fifty in a punnet, Each one picked by hand with care, For a penny paid each punnet... Thus you get your dainty fare. = North America = In North America commercial strawberry horticulture began around 1820 and the fruits were packed in the same manner as that approved by English gardeners; in 1821 it was recommended that Massachusetts strawberry growers carry berries to the Boston markets in \\"pottles, that is, in inverted cones of basket work.‚ÄùMemoirs of the Massachusetts Agricultural Society VI 1821 The English punnet used in the strawberry trade of New York City between 1815 and 1850 was a round shallow basket of woven wickerwork without handles. A handled punnet became more popular in the New York market, as related in the Proceedings of the New Jersey Horticultural Society by Charles W. Idell, who resided in Hoboken and managed a produce market at the foot of Barclay Street, New York:Proceedings of the New Jersey Horticultural Society 1877 p.26 cited in = Manufacture = A 1903 work describes the construction of punnets; By 1969 punnets in the United Kingdom were being made out of thinly lathed poplar wood peelers using a semi-mechanical system. While factory workers still had to interlace the laths, metal staples were used to fix the strips. = Present day forms = Contemporary punnets are generally made in a variety of dimensions of semi- rigid, transparent, lightweight Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with lockable lids, or of clamshell design, and with vents. Their advantage is that they permit visual examination by the consumer but discourage physical contact with the merchandise at point of sale.. As early as 1911 cardboard punnets with wire handles were being usedBunyard, G. (1911).

The system is used to help businesses explore different scenarios by manipulating already collected data from the past events. It consists of information technology, marketing data, systems tools,and modeling capabilities that enable the it to provide predicted outcomes from different scenarios and marketing strategies. MKDSS assists decision makers in different scenarios and can be a very helpful tool for a business to take over their competitors.  Example  A MKDSS is used to support the software vendors‚Äô planning strategy for marketing products. It can help to identify advantageous levels of pricing, advertising spending, and advertising copy for the firm‚Äôs products. This helps determine the firm's marketing mix for product software.  Decision Support Systems (DSS)  The concepts involved in DSS were first expressed in the early 1970s by Scott Morton. These systems are used to help solve complex problems by using computer technology and can help businesses with decision making. DSS has progressed since it was first developed in the 70's. The main areas of research that DDS has developed from are theoretical and technological. There are three types of DSS available: 1. available as a software application, 2. bespoke and 3. user-developed. DSS have many tools that contain different functions such as; sophisticated database management capabilities with access to internal and external data. information, and knowledge; powerful modeling functions accessed by a model management system; powerful, yet simple user interface designs that enable interactive queries, reporting, and graphing functions. Although DSS have many different functions, they are very user friendly and easy to use, flexible and have strong graphic capabilities.  Use of Decision Support Systems  DSS are used mainly used before a company invests their money into something. One of DSS's biggest benefits is its ability to predict the outcome of different scenarios, it can help businesses to save money by preventing failures and put them towards a better cause. Decision support systems can help businesses to save time as well. They would not have to waste even a minute in planning and trying to create something which is not going to succeed.  Satisfaction  MDSS would totally satisfy marketing businesses as it would improve the effectiveness of decision making, reduce costs by eliminating completely unsuitable and useless decisions. DSS helps and improves the performance of decision makers by using a computer system. One of the most important and useful things about a system like this is that it lets the business look forward instead of being stuck and trying to examine the past to get answers to complex questions.

J., C. W. Farris, and Y. Wind (1967), Industrial Buying and Creative Marketing, Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, quoted in Wesley J. Johnston and Thomas V. Bonoma, \\"The Buying Center: Structure and Interaction Patterns\\" in Journal of Marketing, Vol. 45, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 143-156, accessed 6 December 2015 The concept of a DMU was developed in 1967 by Robinson, Farris and Wind (1967). A DMU consists of all the people of an organization, who are involved in the buying decision. The decision to purchase involves those with purchasing and financial expertise; those with technical expertise and of course the top-management. McDonald, Rogers & Woodburn (2000) say that identifying and influencing all the people involved in the buying decision is a prerequisite in the process of sales. The concept of a buying center (as a focus of business-to-business marketing, and as a core fundamental in creating customer value and influence in organisational efficiency and effectiveness) formulates the understanding of purchasing decision-making in complex environments. Some of the key factors influencing a buying center or DMU's activities include: * Buy class (e.g. straight rebuy, new task or modified rebuy) * Product type (e.g. materials, components, plant and equipment and MRO (maintenance, repair and operation) * Importance of the purchase In some cases the buying center is an informal ad hoc group, but in other cases, it is a formally sanctioned group with specific mandates,  Decision-making process  When the DMU wants to purchase a certain product or service the following steps are taken inside the buying center: * Need or problem recognition: the recognition can start for two reasons. The first reason can be to solve a specific problem of the company. The other reason can be to improve a company's current operations/performance or to pursue new market opportunities. * Determining product specification: The specification includes the peculiarities which the product/service that is going to be purchased must contain. * Supplier and product search: this process contains the search for suppliers that can meet a company's product or service needs. First a supplier that matches with the specifications of the company has to be found. The second condition is that the supplier can satisfy the organizations financial and supply requirements. * Evaluation of proposals and selection of suppliers: the different possible suppliers will be evaluated by the different departments of the company. * Selection of order routine: this stadium starts after the selection of the supplier. It mainly consists of negotiating and agreeing with the supplier about certain details. * Performance feedback and evaluation: performance and quality of the purchased goods will be evaluated. In this process of making decisions different roles can be given to certain members of the center of the unit depending on the importance of the part of the organization.  Buying center size  American research undertaken by McWilliams in 1992 found out that the mean size of these buying centers mainly consists of four people. The range in this research was between three and five people. The type of purchase that has to be done and the stage of the buying process influence the size. More recent research found that the structure, including the size, of buying centers depends on the organizational structure, with centralization and formalization driving the development of large buying centers.  Conceptual and methodological issues in buying center research  There are several issues concerning buying centers which need additional research. These issues can be divided into various spheres: = Buying center boundaries and buying center domain = Distinguishing the buying center from its environment, also defining and delimiting the activities of a particular buying center. = Buying center structure = Understanding how organizational structure may differ from or may shape the structure of the buying center and examining how a particular buying strategy may serve to mediate the effects of environmental uncertainty on the structure of the buying center. = Process considerations in buying center = Power and conflict issues within the buying center. = Decision making = One stream of research focuses on the number of decision phases and their timing and the other emphasizes the type of decision-making model (or choice routine) utilized. = Communications flow = The informal interactions that emerge during the buying process.

It lies south of Beckenham, west of Park Langley and Shortlands, north of West Wickham and Monks Orchard and east of Elmers End. History The area was traditionally rural; William Eden leased land here in the 1780s and developed the area as farmland.Willey, Russ. Chambers London Gazetteer, p 157 Large mansions began to be constructed in the area in the 19th century, increasing after the opening of Eden Park station in 1882 and then especially rapidly after the First World War. Many of the older mansions were destroyed and replaced with the suburban housing that now characterises the area. From 1994-2004 the area was home to a large skating park; this was closed by Bromley Council following complaints about noise. Amenities The area contains a row of shops by the railway station, and another row in the area formerly known as Upper Elmers End, as well as a few restaurants including a Hawksmoor, and a Toby Carvery pub, built in 1936 as a hotel. The main parks in the area are Crease Park, named after local Alderman James Crease and opened in July 1936, Stanhope Recreation Ground on Stanhope Grove and Harvington Sports Ground on Eden Park Avenue.

Customers tend to buy products with greater consumer surplus. Software companies should know what measure in their market analysis to determine their consumer surplus so that create products that are better at fulfilling their customers. Messerschmitt and Szyperski have studied what factors affect the perceived consumer surplus in the software product market. The value a customer places on software is affected by things such as compatibility with complementary products, degree of adoption in the market, usability, increases in productivity, differentiation from competitors, and innovativeness. These can be customer satisfaction dimensions. On the other hand, many things affect the total cost of ownership of software products besides price. These include implementation, training, management, and operations costs. Additionally, switching costs to competitors play a role because customers may fear that the vendor may discontinue the product or go out of business. These authors suggest that the price of software should be based on its consumer surplus.

Quantitative marketing research by sampling large customer bases using adaptive conjoint techniques and qualitative marketing research by focus groups and observing customers in stores are examples of techniques they recommend. Benefits to a company of good brand recognition include speeding up new product acceptance, enabling market share penetration by advertising, and resisting price erosion.

Givon, Mahajan, and Muller have researched spreadsheet and word processing software firms to give a clearer image of how to determine market share in the software industry. They propose six factors to help estimate the value of market share (1997): * unit or dollar sales, * user base (since piracy and brand switching effect), * market definition (scope of definitions), * scope of denominator (which other brands included), * time frame length, * product definition (brand, product line, or strategic business unit). Detail A market share analysis needs to take into account the following: Total Market Size refers to the annual business volume in currency or in number of transactions; Market Growth Rate refers to the Compounded Annualized Growth Rate (CAGR) taken over a period of 3 to 5 years; Market Share is the breakup of market size in percentage terms, to help identify the top players, the middle and the \\"minnows\\" of the marketplace, based on the volume of business conducted; Market Segmentation Some of the factors that determine the market are price, quality, speed of service, ease of maintenance, and points of distribution. By mapping on quality and price parameters, it is possible to identify graphically the spaces which are crowded by service providers and which are the relatively empty spots; Key Players i.e.the top players in each segment of the market. The extent to which they provide premium quality, or premium service or price advantage, can help identify future target segments; Swot Analysis. The strengths of players as well as weaknesses/areas of improvement are needed to combat the onslaught in a marketing warfare. Strength and weakness include brand equity, geographic presence, strong management/leadership, technological edge, and patent/copyrights. Emerging Opportunities should be identified which could make the market grow faster/larger or acquire business more easily. Similarly, are there threat factors that could reduce the total market size. These could be due to regulatory guidelines, changes in fashion trends, consumer preference, macro economic events like currency crisis, import/export, war, natural calamity, or demographic shift; Business Continuity Plan: While planning for market share analysis, the worse must be planned for to ensure continuity of the concern in the event of a calamity. Companies which have a continuity plan usually sustain shocks better and ensure achievement of targeted market share. Target Market Share: Based on the above analysis, it is possible to arrive at the overall market size for the assessment period, and thereby decide on the volume of business the firm targets to achieve during the period. This helps determine the firm's targeted market share. This also helps budget for activities like budgeting for R&D;, sales promotion, marketing, and training.

It is the foot equivalent of handedness. While purposes vary, such as applying the greatest force in a certain foot to complete the action of kick as opposed to stomping, footedness is most commonly associated with the preference of a particular foot in the leading position while engaging in foot- or kicking-related sports, such as association football and kickboxing. Ball games In association football, the ball is predominantly struck by the foot. Footedness may refer to the foot a player uses to kick with the greatest force and skill. Most people are right-footed, kicking with the right leg. Capable left-footed footballers are rare and therefore quite sought after. As rare are \\"two-footed\\" players, who are equally capable with both feet. Such players make up only one sixth of players in the top professional leagues in Europe. Two-footedness can be learnt, a notable case being England international Tom Finney, but can only be properly developed in the early years. In Australian Rules Football, several players are equally adept at using both feet to kick the ball, such as Sam Mitchell and Charles Bushnell (footballer, retired). In basketball, a sport composed almost solely of right- handed players, it is common for most athletes to have a dominant left leg which they would use when jumping to complete a right-hand layup. Hence, left- handed basketball players tend to use their right leg more as they finish a left handed layup (although both right- and left-handed players are usually able to use both hands when finishing near the basket). In the National Football League, a disproportionate, and increasing, number of punters punt with their left leg, where punting is the position in play that receives and kicks the ball once it leaves the line of scrimmage. At the end of the 2017 NFL season, 10 out of the league's 32 punters were left-footed, up from four out of 31 (not counting dual-footed punter Chris Hanson, who left the league in 2009) at the beginning of the millennium; in contrast, placekickers were almost exclusively right-footed. The only apparent advantage to punting with the left foot is that, because it is not as common, return specialists are not as experienced handling the ball spinning in the opposite direction. Boardsports In boardsports (e.g., surfing, skateboarding and snowboarding), one stands erect on a single, lightweight board that slides along the ground or on water. The need for balance causes one to position the body perpendicular to the direction of motion, with one foot leading the other. As with handedness, when this task is repetitively performed, one tends to naturally choose a particular foot for the leading position. = Goofy stance vs. Regular stance = Boardsport riders are \\"footed\\" in one of two stances, generally called \\"regular\\" and \\"goofy\\". Riders will generally quickly choose a preferred stance that becomes permanently preferred. A \\"regular\\" stance indicates the left foot leading on the board with the right foot pushing, while a \\"Goofy\\" stance leads with the right foot on the board, pushing with the left. Professionals seem to be evenly distributed between the stances. Practice can yield a high level of ambidexterity between the two stances, such that even seasoned participants of a boardsport have difficulty discerning the footedness of an unfamiliar rider in action. To increase the difficulty, variety, and aesthetic value of tricks, riders can ride \\"switch stance\\" (abbreviated to \\"switch\\"). For example, a goofy-footed skateboarder normally performs an ollie with the right foot forward, but a \\"switch ollie\\" would have the rider standing with the left foot at the front of the board. In sports where switch riding is common and expected, like street skateboarding, riders have the goal of appearing natural at, and performing the same tricks in, both regular and goofy stances. Some sports like kitesurfing and windsurfing generally require the rider to be able to switch stance depending on the wind or travel direction rather than rider preference. Each time direction is changed, the stance changes. Snowboarders who ride switch may adopt a \\"duck stance\\", where the feet are mounted turned out, or pointed away from the mid-line of the body, typically at a roughly 15 degree angle. In this position, the rider will have the leading foot facing forward in either regular or switch stance. =Switch, Fakie and Nollie= When a rider rolls backwards, this is called \\"riding fakie\\". A \\"fakie\\" trick is performed while riding backwards but taking off on the front foot. Although it is the same foot that jumps in one's traditional stance, it is normally the back foot. A rider can also land in the fakie position. While there are some parallels between switch stance and fakie, riding switch implies opening the shoulders more to face the direction headed, though not as much as in traditional stance, while fakie stance implies a slightly more backwards facing, closed shoulder posture. 'Nollie' (nose ollie) is when the front foot takes off when one is riding in their normal stance, the same foot that jumps when doing tricks switch. In nollie position, the body and shoulders are facing forward as much as when riding in normal stance. Generally fakie and nollie are done off the nose, whereas normal and switch are done off the tail. In skateboarding, most tricks that are performed riding backwards ‚Äî with respect to the rider's preferred stance ‚Äî are exclusively categorized as \\"switch\\" (in a switch stance) or as fakie, with the general rule that tricks off the tail are almost always described as fakie, and those off the nose are nollie. For example, a jump using the tail rolling backwards is a \\"fakie ollie\\" (not a \\"switch nollie\\"), and a jump off the nose is a \\"nollie\\" (not a \\"fakie nollie\\"). Mongo foot Mongo foot refers to the use of the rider's front foot for pushing. Normally, a skateboarder will feel more comfortable using their back foot to push, while their front foot remains on the board. In the minority case of mongo-footed skateboarders, the opposite is true. Some skateboarders who do not push mongo in their regular stance may still push mongo when riding in switch stance, rather than push with their weaker back foot. Some well-known skaters who change between mongo and normal when pushing switch include Jacob Vance, Stevie Williams, and Eric Koston. Although its origins remain uncertain, it is widely believed that the term derives from the pejorative use of \\"mongoloid\\". BMX In BMX, there is a de facto relationship between footedness and preferences of grinding position and of mid-air turning direction. The terms \\"regular\\" and \\"goofy\\" do not indicate a foot preference as in boardsports, but rather whether the rider's footedness has the usual relationship with their grinding and mid-air turning preferences. For example, consider the following classes of riders: * right- footed riders who prefer turning counter-clockwise in the air, and grinding on their right * left-footed riders who prefer turning clockwise in the air, and grinding on their left. Both classes are of equal size and would be considered \\"regular\\". \\"Goofy\\" would describe riders whose trick preferences do not match their footedness: a rider who prefers to grind on the opposite side as do most is considered a \\"goofy grinder\\"; one who prefers to turn the opposite direction in mid-air as do most is considered a \\"goofy spinner\\". Few riders have either goofy trait, but some riders may have both.

The concept was developed by Bankers Trust and principal designer Dan Borge in the late 1970s. Note, however, that increasingly return on risk-adjusted capital (RORAC) is used as a measure, whereby the risk adjustment of Capital is based on the capital adequacy guidelines as outlined by the Basel Committee. Basic formulae :\\\\mbox{RAROC} = {\\\\mbox{Expected return} \\\\over \\\\mbox{Economic capital}} Quantifying Risk in the Electricity Business: A RAROC-based Approach or \\\\mbox{RAROC} = {\\\\mbox{Expected return} \\\\over \\\\mbox{Value at risk}} Broadly speaking, in business enterprises, risk is traded off against benefit. RAROC is defined as the ratio of risk adjusted return to economic capital. The economic capital is the amount of money which is needed to secure the survival in a worst-case scenario, it is a buffer against unexpected shocks in market values. Economic capital is a function of market risk, credit risk, and operational risk, and is often calculated by VaR. This use of capital based on risk improves the capital allocation across different functional areas of banks, insurance companies, or any business in which capital is placed at risk for an expected return above the risk-free rate. RAROC system allocates capital for two basic reasons: #Risk management #Performance evaluation For risk management purposes, the main goal of allocating capital to individual business units is to determine the bank's optimal capital structure‚Äîthat is economic capital allocation is closely correlated with individual business risk. As a performance evaluation tool, it allows banks to assign capital to business units based on the economic value added of each unit.  Decision measures based on regulatory and economic capital  With the financial crisis of 2007, and the introduction of Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act, and Basel III, the minimum required regulatory capital requirements have become onerous. An implication of stringent regulatory capital requirements spurred debates on the validity of required economic capital in managing an organization‚Äôs portfolio composition, highlighting that constraining requirements should have organizations focus entirely on the return on regulatory capital in measuring profitability and in guiding portfolio composition. The counterargument highlights that concentration and diversification effects should play a prominent role in portfolio selection ‚Äì dynamics recognized in economic capital, but not regulatory capital. It did not take long for the industry to recognize the relevance and importance of both regulatory and economic measures and eschewed, focusing exclusively on one or the other. Relatively simple rules were devised to have both regulatory and economic capital enter into the process. In 2012, researchers at Moody‚Äôs Analytics designed a formal extension to the RAROC model that accounts for regulatory capital requirements as well as economic risks. In the framework, capital allocation can be represented as a composite capital measure (CCM) that is a weighted combination of economic and regulatory capital ‚Äì with the weight on regulatory capital determined by the degree to which an organization is a capital constrained.

To many people, the Bijlmer designation is used to refer to Amsterdam Zuidoost as a pars pro toto. The other neighbourhoods in Amsterdam Zuidoost are Gaasperdam, Bullewijk, Venserpolder and Driemond. The Bijlmermeer neighbourhood, which today houses almost 50,000 people of over 150 nationalities, was designed as a single project as part of a then innovative Modernist approach to urban design. Led by architect Siegfried Nassuth and team, the original neighbourhood was designed as a series of nearly identical high-rise buildings laid out in a hexagonal grid. The goal was to create open spaces for recreation at grade, elevated roads to reduce pollution and traffic from those same recreation areas, and residences climbing upward offering residents views, clean air, and sunlight. The apartments were meant to attract a suburban population, in the manner of condominium housing. The buildings have several features that distinguish them from traditional Dutch high-rise flats, such as tubular walkways connecting the flats and garages. The blocks are separated by large green areas planted with grass and trees. Each flat has its own garages where cars can be parked. The Bijlmer was designed with two levels of traffic. Cars drive on the top level, the decks of which fly over the lower levels, pedestrian avenues and bicycle paths. This separation of fast and slow moving traffic is conducive to traffic safety. However, in recent years, the roads are once again being put into a single plane, so pedestrians, cycles and cars travel alongside each other. This is a move to lessen the effects of the 'inhuman' scale of some of the Bijlmer's designs and improve safety using direct sightlines. Because of the Bijlmer's peripheral position relative to the city centre, it was decided that metro lines would be built connecting the Bijlmer with other neighbourhoods. The Oostlijn (east line, comprising two lines, numbered 53 and 54) links the Bijlmer to the Central Station of Amsterdam, while the Ringlijn links it with the port area at Sloterdijk. Trouble High-rise buildings in the Bijlmermeer. Red are flats still standing, while gray is demolished. The plane icon marks the location of the El Al Flight 1862 crash. Until recently, Bijlmermeer struggled to draw in many middle-class families. Following Suriname's independence in 1975, many of its inhabitants migrated to the Netherlands. The government placed a substantial number of them in affordable social housing in the Bijlmermeer. The neighbourhood once had a very high crime rate, but this has decreased dramatically in recent years. The number of registered complaints to the police decreased from 20,000 in 1995 (of which 2,000 were robberies) to 8,000 (of which 600 were robberies) in 2005. The area has always been home to many different nationalities simultaneously. Throughout the years, claims of rising social segregation or ghettoization have been both denied and pre- empted by local government. Urban renewal After El Al Flight 1862 crashed into two Bijlmermeer buildings in 1992, an incident known as the Bijlmerramp (Dutch for \\"Bijlmer Disaster\\"), it was decided that the neighbourhood needed some further change. In recent years, many of the high rise buildings have been renovated or torn down. More expensive low-rise housing has been built to attract more middle- and upper-income residents. This resulted in significant reduction in crime and a more balanced socio-economic composition, whilst at the same time maintaining the area's ethnic mix. Lately students have discovered the Bijlmer as an affordable place to live compared to the city centre where space is limited and costs of living are high.

In addition to becoming Prime Minister, H. C. Hansen also retained the post as Foreign Minister until 1958. Among the laws passed by this government included the universal people's pension and the enactment of agricultural price supports. The law on assistance to single mothers of April 1955 introduced special assistance for widows with children and certain other categories of single women, while under the Accident Insurance Act of 1959, an independent board of appeal was set up, waiting times were reduced, compensation for survivors was converted from lump sums into running benefits, and the scheme extended to cover occupational diseases. Under a law on relations between trade union a and employers‚Äô associations, passed in April 1956, as an offshoot of collective agreement on the labour market, a new scheme provided sickness cash benefits significantly higher than in the existing health insurance scheme. The new scheme only covered members of trade unions and those employed by members of the Danish Employers‚Äô Association. In addition, under the Apprenticeship Act of September 1956, theoretical training was introduced at technical schools as part of apprenticeship training. In 1956, universal pension coverage in Denmark was introduced, while the Survivors‚Äô Pension Act of March 1959 introduced a general survivors‚Äô pension scheme, including specific provisions for single women having reached age 60. In 1959, a law was enacted that led to the establishment of the Mental Retardation Service and a decentralised regional system of services for those with intellectual disabilities. That same year, an extension of covered occupational diseases in work injury compensation was carried out. In 1958, an education reform was enacted that reduced educational barriers. In March 1957 it had been 4 years since the last election to the Folketing, and as mandated by the Danish constitution new elections were held. After the election H. C. Hansen was able to partner with the Danish Social Liberal Party (Radikale Venstre) and Justice Party of Denmark (Retsforbundet) to form the Cabinet of H.C. Hansen II, also known as the Triangle Cabinet (Trekantsregeringen). On 25 March 1957 France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the Treaty of Rome to create the European Economic Community. To not be left behind the Danish government first wanted to join a Nordic free trade organization, but that failed and Denmark joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) on 3 May 1960 instead. Unlike his successors as Social Democratic leaders and prime minister, Hansen did not support Denmark joining the European Economic Community that eventually took place in 1972. H. C. Hansen died from cancer on 19 February 1960, and was succeeded by Viggo Kampmann in the Social Democratic party and as Prime Minister. He was the second Danish prime minister in a row to die while in office. ReferencesOther sources * Kristian Hvidt (1995) Statsministre i Danmark fra 1913 til 1995 (Nyt nordisk forlag A.

The Art Deco and International Style building was designed by the architects Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff and constructed in 1935. Although sometimes claimed to be the first major Modernist public building in Britain, it was in fact preceded by some months by the Dutch-influenced Hornsey Town Hall. In 2005, after an extensive restoration, the De La Warr Pavilion reopened as a contemporary arts centre, encompassing one of the largest galleries on the south coast of England. History The new seafront building was the result of an architectural competition initiated by Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr, after whom the building was named. The 9th Earl, a committed socialist and Mayor of Bexhill, persuaded Bexhill council to develop the site as a public building. The competition was announced in the Architects' Journal in February 1934, with a programme that specified an entertainment hall to seat at least 1500 people; a 200-seat restaurant; a reading room; and a lounge. Initially, the budget for the project was limited to ¬£50,000, although this was later raised to ¬£80,000. Run by the Royal Institute of British Architects, this competition attracted over 230 entrants, many of them practising in the Modernist style. Shapes tend towards streamlined, industrially-influenced designs The architects selected for the project, Erich Mendelsohn and Serge Chermayeff, were leading figures in the Modern Movement. The aesthetics employed in the International Style proved especially suited to the building, tending towards streamlined, industrially- influenced designs, often with expansive metal-framed windows, and eschewing traditional brick and stonework in favour of concrete and steel construction. Amongst the building's most innovative features was its use of a welded steel frame construction, pioneered by structural engineer Felix Samuely. Construction of the De La Warr Pavilion began in January 1935. The building was opened on 12 December of the same year by the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). During World War II, the De La Warr Pavilion was used by the military. Bexhill and Sussex in general were vulnerable if the Germans decided to mount an invasion (Operation Sea Lion). Amongst those who served at the Pavilion during the War was Spike Milligan, later a noted comedian. The building suffered minor damage to its foundations when the Metropole hotel adjacent to the building's western side was destroyed by German bombers. A stairwell in the pavilion After the War, management of the Pavilion was taken over by Bexhill Corporation (which later became Rother District Council). In the 1970s and 1980s, changes were made to the building, many of which were inconsistent with its original design and aesthetic. Lack of funds also resulted in an ongoing degradation of the building‚Äôs fabric. It was used as a venue for indoor car boot sales and the exterior lost its original signage. In 1986, the De La Warr Pavilion was granted a Grade I listed Building status, essentially protecting the building from further inappropriate alteration. 1989 saw the formation of the Pavilion Trust, a group dedicated to protecting and restoring the building. Playwright David Hare notioned that the site be used as an art gallery as opposed to an expected privatised redevelopment.\\"A celebration of 500 years of British Art\\". Life: The Observer magazine, 19 March 2000 In 2002, after a long application process the De La Warr Pavilion was granted ¬£6 Million by the Heritage Lottery Fund & the Arts Council of England, to restore the building and turn it into a contemporary arts centre. Work began in 2004 on the De La Warr Pavilion‚Äôs regeneration and a transfer of the buildings ownership from Rother District Council to the De La Warr Pavilion Charitable Trust. In 2005, after an 18 month long extensive programme of restoration, the De La Warr Pavilion reopened as a contemporary arts centre, encompassing one of the largest galleries on the south coast of England. A small collection of archival materials related to the De La Warr Pavilion is collected in the Serge Chermayeff Papers held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University in New York City. Quotes ‚ÄúIt is the intention of the promoters that the building should be simple in design, and suitable for a holiday resort in the south of England. Character in design can be obtained by the use of large window spaces, terraces and canopies. No restriction as to style of architecture will be imposed but buildings must be simple, light in appearance and attractive, suitable for a Holiday Resort.

Tourists can view Sapporo and Odori Park. History Observation deck of the tower The TV Tower was built in 1957 by Tach≈´ Nait≈ç, a Japanese architect who is famous for planning the Tokyo Tower, with the total construction costs of 170 million yen. Since the transmission facility was established on the Mount Teine, Sapporo TV Tower has worked as a repeater of AIR-G' and FM North Wave, a radio station based in Sapporo. In 1961, digital clocks were installed at the height of 65 metres from the ground, which were donated by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., a Japanese electronics manufacturer. This installation was suggested by the founder of the company Konosuke Matsushita, who thought these digital clocks would draw a great attention to the Tower. These digital clocks, installed at four sides of the Tower, have been repaired two times: in 1998 and 2006. The interior and exterior of the Sapporo TV Tower were renovated in 2002, and the color of walls at the second and third floors were changed from pale green to dark green. In the second repair of the digital clocks in 2006, the light-emitting diode was adopted, and the advertisement right below the clocks was changed from the \\"National\\" to \\"Panasonic\\". The Sapporo TV Tower commemorated its 50th anniversary in 2007, and some events and discount campaign were held.50th anniversary campaign of the Tower Recently, a plan of reconstructing a new TV tower of 650 metres high has come up. In the plan, the area of the supposed Tower would be 7800 m¬≤, and the height of the observation deck is supposed to be at 500 metres.The plan of the new TV Tower The height of the new Tower will exceed Tokyo Skytree (634 meters) if it is realized. The new Tower building is also planned to house hotel rooms, offices, and sports facilities in addition to the function as the TV tower. Outline A view of the tower from the Odori Park A view of the tower from the Odori Park The ground floor of the Sapporo TV Tower houses an information center and stores. The multipurpose hall and administration office of the Tower are placed on the second floor, and a souvenir shop and restaurant are located on the third floor. The basement connects to the Aurora Town, an underground shopping arcade, and a number of restaurants called the \\"Tele-chika Gourmet Court\\" are located. The official mascot of the Tower is \\"Tawakkie\\", and the unofficial character \\"Terebi-T≈çsan\\" (Television Daddy) is also known. The lift to the observation deck at 90 metres high is located on the third floor, where visitors are required to buy tickets to continue to the observation deck. From the observation deck, the entire view of the Odori Park, Mount ≈åkura, and Maruyama are seen. Having the height of 147.2 metres, the Sapporo TV Tower used to be the most prominent figure in Sapporo, but recently many high-rise buildings have been constructed around the Odori Park, making the Tower less prominent.

It is located approximately northwest of the town of Braintree, and approximately southeast of Saffron Walden. The village came to national attention during the 1950s as home to the Great Bardfield Artists. History Henry VIII is said to have given Bardfield to Anne of Cleves as part of his divorce settlement and a number of buildings in the village are associated with Anne of Cleves, including the Grade II-listed Great Lodge and its associated Grade I-listed barn, now named after her. The grounds include a Grade I-listed barn and a vineyard. Great Bardfield is home to the Bardfield Cage, a 19th-century village lock-up, and the Gibraltar Mill, a windmill which has been converted to a house. Great Bardfield played an important role in the history of the oxlip which, in the UK, is a rare plant only found where Suffolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire meet. Originally it was thought that oxlips were cowslip-primrose hybrids but in 1842 Henry Doubleday and Charles Darwin conducted tests on plants collected from Great Bardfield and concluded that this was not so. For a while the plant was known as the Bardfield Oxlip. The common cowslip-primrose hybrid is known as the False Oxlip. Great Bardfield Artists Bardfield was the home of many important twentieth-century English artists who hosted a series of important 'open house' exhibitions in the village during the 1950s. These exhibitions garnered national press attention and attracted thousands of visitors. The Great Bardfield Artists of the 1940s and 1950s were: John Aldridge, Edward Bawden, George Chapman, Stanley Clifford-Smith, Audrey Cruddas, Walter Hoyle, Michael Rothenstein, Eric Ravilious (who lodged with Bawden at Brick House), Sheila Robinson and Marianne Straub. Other artists linked to the art community include Joan Glass, Duffy Ayers, Laurence Scarfe and the political cartoonist David Low.

In British English, the term is normally used for what in North American English are called salt shakers.https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/salt- cellarhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/salt-cellar Salt cellars can be either lidded or open, and are found in a wide range of sizes, from large shared vessels to small individual dishes. Styles range from simple to ornate or whimsical, using materials including glass and ceramic, metals, ivory and wood, and plastic. Use of salt cellars is documented as early as classical Rome. They continued to be used through the first half of the 20th century; however, usage began to decline with the introduction of free-flowing salt in 1911, and at last they have been almost entirely replaced by salt shakers. Salt cellars were early collectible as pieces of silver, pewter, glass, etc. Soon after their role at table was replaced by the shaker, salt cellars became a popular collectible in their own right. Etymology Black- glaze salt cellar. Terracotta, 5th century BC, Athens. The word salt-cellar is attested in English from the 15th century. It combines the English word salt with the Anglo-Norman word saler, which already by itself meant \\"salt container\\". Salt cellars are known, in various forms, by assorted names including open salt, salt dip, standing salt, master salt, and salt dish. A master salt is the large receptacle from which the smaller, distributed, salt dishes are filled; according to fashion or custom it was lidded, or open, or covered with a cloth. A standing salt is a master salt, so-named because it remained in place as opposed to being passed. A trencher salt is a small salt cellar located next to the trencher (i.e., place setting). Open salt and salt dip refer to salt dishes that are uncovered. The term salt cellar is also used generally to describe any container for table salt, thus encompassing salt shakers and salt pigs. History Cellini's Salt Cellar, made for Francis I of France, 1540‚Äì1543. Gold, partly enameled, with an ebony base. Depicts Earth and Sea personified. Greek artifacts from the classical period in the shape of small bowls are often called saltcellars. Their function remains uncertain though they may have been used for condiments including salt. The Romans had the salinum, a receptacle typically of silver and regarded as essential in every household. The salinum had ceremonial importance as the container of the (salt) offering made during the meal, but it was also used to dispense salt to diners. During the Middle Ages, elaborate master salt cellars evolved. Placed at the head table, this large receptacle was a sign of status and prosperity, prominently displayed. It was usually made of silver and often decorated in motifs of the sea. In addition to the master salt, smaller, simpler salt cellars were distributed for diners to share; these could take forms as simple as slices of stale bread. The social status of guests could be measured by their positions relative to the master's large salt cellar: high-ranking guests sat above the salt while those of lesser importance sat below the salt. Formal place setting for a 12 course dinner; individual salt cellar at top of place setting. Large, ornate master salts continued to be made through the Renaissance and Baroque periods, becoming more ceremonial. In England the ornamental master salt came to be called a standing salt, because it was not passed but remained in place. By 1588, reference is documented in England to the \\"trencher salt\\"; by the early 18th century, these had mostly supplanted large salts. Tiny salt spoons appear in the 17th century, and in increasing numbers as the use of trencher salts increased. The advent of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th to early 19th centuries rendered both salt and salt cellars commonplace. From about 1825 pressed glass manufacture became an industry and thrived; because they were easy to mold, salt cellars were among the earliest items mass-produced by this method. Similarly the development of Sheffield plate (18th century), then electroplating (19th century), led to mass production of affordable silver-plated wares, including salt cellars. Salt shakers began to appear in the Victorian era, and patents show attempts to deal with the problem of salt clumping, but they remained the exception rather than the norm. It was not until after 1911, when anti-caking agents began to be added to table salt, that salt shakers gained favor and open salts began to fall into disuse. Collectibility Open salt dish, pressed glass; Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, 1830‚Äì1835. Silver, glass, china, pewter, stoneware, and other media used in the creation of tableware are collectible and have most likely been collected for centuries. By extension, salt cellars first became collectible as pieces of silver, glass, etc. Whether because of their commonness (and hence affordability), or the wide variety of them, or because of their slide into anachronism and quaintness, salt cellars themselves became collectible at latest by the 1930s.

Although antique salt cellars are not difficult to find and can be very affordable, modern manufacturers and artisans continue to make salt cellars.

Its tight integration with other Apple applications allowed users to take Final Cut Pro and Motion projects and render them into the DVD format without encoding to intermediary formats. This streamlined the production workflow and reduces overhead. It was discontinued with the release of Final Cut Pro X, Motion 5, and Compressor 4. History Apple bought Astarte's DVDirector in 2000, re-releasing it as DVD Studio Pro in 2001. Version 1.5, still based on this original code, was released in April 2002. In the meantime Apple had acquired Spruce Technologies in 2001, and was busy retooling the DVD authoring package that came with that acquisition (DVD Maestro), and in August 2003, Apple released DVD Studio Pro 2. This new version was basically a new application, with a totally new interface. Since then, the program has grown to be the primary mid-range software DVD creation package, Sonic ScenaristScenarist being the worldwide industry standard for professional DVD authoring. DVD Studio Pro 3 was released in 2004. In April 2005, Apple updated DVD Studio Pro to support authoring HD content. DVD Studio Pro 4 allowed for the burning of HD DVD content to both standard DVDs and HD DVD media (even though no HD DVD burners were currently available for Macintosh). For playing back HD DVD content burned to a standard DVD, Apple requires a PowerPC G5, Apple DVD Player v4.6, and Mac OS X v10.4 or later. This was also the first version that did not include support for Mac OS 9. In January 2006 Apple stopped offering DVD Studio Pro as a stand-alone product, selling it only as part of the Final Cut Studio suite. The 4.0.3 update, released in the same month, upgrades the program to the finalized HD DVD 1.0 specification. It also supports the native H.264 specification. The 4.2 update, which shipped with the Final Cut Studio 2 release, was simply a compatibility update and did not add any major new features. See also a release history in context with the rest of Final Cut Studio. Features DVD Studio Pro has a graphical \\"map\\" view, which shows all the menus, tracks and scripts in the project as color-coded tiles, with the connections between them as arrows. New menus, layered menus, scripts and slideshows can be created from this view and arranged; and the item that will play first on the DVD can be set. Assets (i.e. photos, sounds and Motion projects) are imported into the asset manager and can then be dragged and dropped into one or more places within the project (creating a link to the asset rather than duplicating it). Menus can be created with templates, or pre-made buttons, and with the help of dynamic guidelines they can be kept in a grid arrangement. Other features include: * Subtitle creation * Implementation of CSS and Macrovision copy protection for SD DVDs * Editing of GPRM and SPRM registers * Disabling certain functions on particular menus * Creating multiple language versions of a menu * Creating multiple versions (\\"stories\\") of a video project, for example, a director's cut * DVD@CCESS feature for web links in menus * A range of transition effects to set between menus Workflow The video project is typically sent from Final Cut Pro to Compressor, where it can be converted into the DVD MPEG-2 format with Dolby Digital (ac3) or AIFF sound. Menus with motion graphics can be created in Motion. It is possible to set the menu's loop point in either Motion or DVD Studio Pro; likewise it is possible to define chapters within either Final Cut Pro or DVD Studio Pro. The menus and the encoded video assets are imported into the application and the menu system is constructed; afterwards it can be simulated in a mock DVD player interface. The final VIDEO_TS or HVDVD_TS directory for the DVD can be created using the \\"Build\\" feature. The \\"Format\\" function takes this directory and writes it to a disc or disk image.

The formal rectangular market place, with lawns and horse-chestnut trees, was inspired by the square at Bosco Marengo in Lombardy, admired by the young earl during his grand tour of Europe. The houses lining the village square are mostly mid-18th century, though all four churches (Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodist) are later.

Nothing is known of his early life or education; the title pages of two of his plays identify him as a \\"Gentleman,\\" though there is no record of him at either of the two universities or the Inns of Court. Scholars have guessed that he was born c. 1590; if, as some scholars think, he wrote the Address \\"To the knowing Reader\\" in the first quarto of King John and Matilda, he was still alive in 1655. He enters the historical record in 1624, when two of his plays were licensed by the Master of the Revels.G. E. Bentley, The Jacobean and Caroline Stage, vol. 3 (1956). Pp. 225‚Äì238. His extant dramatic canon consists of only three plays: The City Nightcap, A New Trick to Cheat the Devil, and King John and Matilda. King John and Matilda (printed 1655) bears strong resemblances to The Death of Robert Earl of Huntingdon, the second of Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle's two Robin Hood plays, and can be regarded as virtually a rewrite of the earlier work. Yet Charles Lamb admired Davenport's version, and quoted from the closing scene in his Dramatic Specimens. The City Nightcap was licensed in 1624, but not printed until 1661. The subplot of this play was borrowed from Miguel de Cervantes and Giovanni Boccaccio, and Aphra Behn's Amorous Prince (1671) is an adaptation of it. A New Trick to Cheat the Devil (printed 1639) is a farce, which contains among other things the idea of the popular supper story which reappears in Hans Christian Andersen's Little Claus and Big Claus. As told by Davenport the story closely resembles the Scottish Freres of Berwick, which was printed in 1603. Three other plays entered in the Stationers Register as Davenport's have not survived: The Peddler, The Fatal Brothers, and The Politic Queen. Samuel Sheppard, in a 1651 epigram, mentions a fourth lost work, The Pirate, which he thought showed how Davenport \\"Rival'st Shakespeare, though thy glory's lesse\\". Davenport is also reported to have collaborated with Thomas Drue on The Woman's Mistaken, and that too is lost. A history play titled Henry I was licensed for performance by the King's Men on 10 April 1624 as Davenport's work; it has not survived. In 1653, when the stationer Humphrey Moseley registered Cardenio as the work of Shakespeare and John Fletcher, he simultaneously registered a Henry I and a Henry II as the works of \\"Shakespeare, & Dauenport.\\" John Warburton the antiquarian recorded the Shakespeare/Davenport Henry I in his manuscript collection‚Äîbut it was one of the plays destroyed by Warburton's cook. While the Henry I licensed in 1624 was certainly a play for the King's Men, it first appears eight years after Shakespeare's death and scholars have been universally skeptical that Davenport and Shakespeare ever worked together. Three significant poems by Davenport also survive. They are: A Crown for a Conqueror, a religious poem, and Too Late to Call Back Yesterday, a moral dialogue, both published in 1639; and A Survey of the Sciences, which survived in manuscript and was published only in the 1880s. Davenports plays were reprinted by A. H. Bullen in Old English Plays (new series, 1890).

Born in the Lambeth district of London, Cusick became interested in engineering while still at art school and began attending evening classes. However, his father wanted him to follow a more regular career, so Cusick took a course in mathematics and science at Borough Polytechnic, intending to become a civil engineer. Not finding this to his liking, he enlisted instead in the British Army and found himself stationed in Palestine, but did not enjoy that experience either. On his return to England he completed a teacher training course, but then obtained a nine-month position in repertory theatre at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Cardiff.Raymond P. Cusick - Profile and interview, Television Heaven website In the late 1950s Cusick briefly took a position teaching art but applied and was accepted for a post at the Wimbledon Theatre where he remained for three years. Cusick joined the BBC in 1960Marcus Williamson \\"Raymond Cusick: Designer whose greatest creation was Dr Who's biggest foes, The Daleks\\", The Independent, 26 February 2013 as a staff designer and was responsible for the set design of many Doctor Who stories, creating not just futuristic settings but also historical sets and dioramas. Another BBC in-house designer, future filmmaker Ridley Scott, had been assigned to design the Daleks in 1963, but scheduling conflicts saw the job handed to Cusick. Cusick worked on other BBC television programmes including The Pallisers, The Duchess of Duke Street, On Giant's Shoulders, When the Boat Comes In, Rentaghost and Miss Marple. As Cusick was a salaried BBC employee at the time he designed the Daleks, he was not paid royalties. Given the large revenue generated by merchandise featuring Cusick's Dalek design, he felt that he should have been paid a royalty (as was script writer Terry Nation, who created the concept of the Daleks but did not design them). When Cusick left Doctor Who in 1966, unhappy with the lack of recognition he had received for his work on the series, the show's producer and head designer did arrange for the BBC to recognise his contribution with an ex-gratia payment of around . In the late 1970s, he was a designer for the James Burke BBC programme Connections. He lived near Horsham, West Sussex. After retiring as an art director for the BBC in 1988, his hobby was writing about battles from the Napoleonic era‚Äîhe contributed to a number of specialist magazines and periodicals on the subject. Cusick was interviewed for the BBC video release Daleks: The Early Years (1992) and in July 2008 he appeared in an episode of the BBC Three documentary series Doctor Who Confidential. In both instances, Cusick spoke of the original Dalek design and how the concept came to fruition. The end titles of the 2016 animated reconstruction of The Power of the Daleks (1966) give official credit to Cusick for designing the Daleks.

Radio Since 1975 Chusid has been a DJ on free-form radio station WFMU, where he hosted an unpredictable and idiosyncratic weekly program whose content he calls \\"genre-surfing tokenism\\".Irwin Chusid program archives at WFMU.org In June 2020, he left the weekly schedule, but remains on the air staff. Prior to his involvement at WFMU, he worked briefly at WPKN radio from 1969-1971 while an undergrad at the University of Bridgeport (which he left after two years); in 1977, while living in New Orleans, he hosted a weekly program on WTUL. In 1988, he served as a comedy writer for author/humorist Tom Bodett's syndicated radio series, The End of the Road. In the late 1970s, Chusid was one of the first DJs to regularly air recordings of Jandek, The Shaggs, Lucia Pamela, and R. Stevie Moore on the radio. In the early 1980s he programmed a weekly segment entitled The Atrocious Music Hour, which featured recordings from such non-musical celebrities as William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.Oliveiri, Chad, Interview with Irwin Chusid, Rochester City Paper, February 16, 2005 This subgenre was eventually chronicled by Rhino Records on their Golden Throats series of albums, for which Chusid authored liner notes.Liner notes credit for Golden Throats, at Discogs.comLiner notes credit for Golden Throats, Vol. 2, at Discogs.com These compilations contributed to Shatner's revived celebrity, albeit with overtones of self-parody. Between 1997 and 2002 Chusid was the co-host (with Michelle Boul√©) of the Incorrect Music Hour on WFMU.Incorrect Music program archives at WFMU.org From 2005 to 2007 he programmed vintage Calypso, Soca and Mento on a one-hour weekly program entitled Muriel's Treasure.Muriel's Treasure program archives at WFMU.org Music projects Chusid is credited with the rediscovery and popularization of the \\"Space Age Bachelor Pad\\" music of Juan Garc√≠a Esquivel, which helped spark the 1990s resurgence of vintage exotica and lounge music. He compiled the first CD reissues of Esquivel and Raymond Scott, and manages the musical estates of both deceased composers/bandleaders.

After much legwork and ten label rejections, Chusid licensed the project to Netherlands-based Basta Audio-Visuals and (for North America) Hoboken-based Bar/None Records, who in October 2001 released the recordings on a CD entitled The Langley Schools Music Project.Chusid discusses discovery of the Langley recordings during interview on Late Nights with Iain Lee, May 26, 2017 Within one week of its release, the album went to #1 on Amazon.com.

Chusid was credited as \\"Solicitor and Overseer.\\") In 2013, he undertook administration of Boettcher's publishing on behalf of the late songwriter's son, Varek Boettcher. In 1997 Chusid co- produced (with Edie Adams and Josh Mills) the Ernie Kovacs Record Collection (Varese-Sarabande), a compilation of songs and themes used by the legendary TV comedian in his programs during the 1950s and early 1960s.The Ernie Kovacs Record Collection at AllMusic The package was designed by noted illustrator Chris Ware.The Ernie Kovacs Records Collection artwork credit at Discogs.com In 2004 he curated Interesting Results: Music by a Committee of One for UK's Sonic Arts Network, a CD-publication of DIY music with cut-out figures of the featured artists.Fletcher, Andrew, review of Interesting Results, Computer Music Journal, Vol. 31, issue 4 In 2010 Chusid compiled for WFMU Don't Mess With the Power Child, the first collection of late 1980s recordings by an uninhibited, hyperactive 10-year-old Alabama girl named Amanda (Whitt).Don't Mess With the Power Child at WFMU's Free Music Archive These recordings aired frequently on WFMU and subsequently achieved widespread notoriety via the web. A follow-up, Let's Get Plastered and Raid Circus World, was compiled for WFMU in 2011. Besides administering the Raymond Scott, Esquivel, Bob Thompson, Sun Ra, Curt Boettcher, and Shooby Taylor musical estates, he oversees the business affairs and publishing of R.

Outsider music In a July 1996 Pulse magazine article entitled \\"You Want Alternative?\\", Chusid coined the term \\"outsider music\\",Campau, Don, The Living Archive of Underground Music, interview with Irwin Chusid, November 2, 2011 which he defines as \\"crackpot and visionary music, where all trails lead essentially one place: over the edge\\". Chusid has drawn a distinction between the terms \\"incorrect music\\" (as used on his WFMU radio program) and \\"outsider music\\", which he insists are not synonymous and overlap only slightly. Chusid has explained that Incorrect Music was a radio concept, which included all manner of musical \\"wrongness\\", often by people who should have known better, or whose sincerity was questionable. Outsider musicians, on the other hand, he defines as \\"artists who are often termed 'bad' or 'inept' by listeners who judge them by the standards of mainstream popular music. Yet despite dodgy rhythms and a lack of conventional tunefulness, these often self-taught artists radiate an abundance of earnestness and passion. Most importantly, they betray an absence of pretense. And they're worth listening to, often outmatching all contenders for inventiveness and originality.\\" His book Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music (2000), published by A Cappella Books, covered musical oddballs and obscure visionaries. Reviewing this testament to twisted tunesmiths, Publishers Weekly commented: :He profiles 20 darlings of dissonance. Several of them -- including Tiny Tim, Captain Beefheart and Pink Floyd's former acid troubadour Syd Barrett -- have made a few compilation bangs, but the great majority have enjoyed mere dog-like whimpers of success. Take Eilert Pilarm, the Swedish Elvis; Joe Meek, who produced the 1962 instrumental hit 'Telstar' before committing suicide; and The Shaggs, three sheltered sisters from Fremont, N.H., who recorded the 'aboriginal rock' masterpiece 'Philosophy of the World'. Careful not to ridicule his more eccentrically volatile subjects (e.g., Wesley Willis and Daniel Johnston), Chusid narrates each musician's vital statistics and career with rhythm and respectful compilation wit. The book also includes brief profiles of numerous lesser-known outsider musicians, including Arcesia, Bingo Gazingo, and Y. Bhekhirst. BJ Snowden, Shooby Taylor (\\"The Human Horn\\"), Wesley Willis, and other musicians profiled in the book can be heard on two CDs produced and annotated by Chusid. Bill Meyer reviewed the first CD: :This collection is a compilation companion to Irwin Chusid's book of the same name. It celebrates outsider music, music \\"so wrong it's right\\", and if you're drawn to sounds that make you wonder just what the musician was thinking, this collection is for you. The compilation is enthusiastically, if not always respectfully, annotated by Chusid. His selections range from the output of blissfully un- self-aware but basically functional individuals to the certifiably insane. Among the former are Lucia Pamela, an Ethel Merman sound-alike who contributes an infectiously enthusiastic celebration of \\"Walking on the Moon\\", and Congress-Woman Malinda Jackson Parker, a late Liberian lawmaker whose \\"Cousin Mosquito #1\\" cautioned against contracting insect-borne disease. The latter includes Daniel Johnston, whose \\"Walking the Cow\\" weds a sublime melody to puzzling lyrics and a toy keyboard arrangement, and Wesley Willis, who pays tribute to Chicago's \\"Rock 'n' Roll McDonald's\\". Some of the artists are quite famous (Tiny Tim), some anonymous (the unknown writer and performers of song- poem \\"Virgin Child of the Universe\\")‚Äîthey're united by their blithe certitude that the world needed to hear their unlikely but singular creations. Volumes one and two of the digital audio releases of Songs in the Key of Z were reissued in expanded (25 tracks each) and remastered format in September 2013, along with all-new volumes three and four. Visual arts projects Chusid chronicled the overlooked work of innovative record cover artist/commercial illustrator Jim Flora (1914‚Äì1998)Jim Flora anthologies published by Fantagraphics Books in his colorful 180-page trade paperback, The Mischievous Art of Jim Flora (Fantagraphics, 2004). A follow-up, The Curiously Sinister Art of Jim Flora, co-authored with (former KFAI radio host) Barbara Economon, was published by Fantagraphics in February 2007. The latter book unveiled Flora's bizarre and rarely seen paintings, woodcuts, sketches, and early works. A third anthology, The Sweetly Diabolic Art of Jim Flora, was published in July 2009. A fourth book, The High Fidelity Art of Jim Flora, focusing on Flora's illustrated album covers and music ephemera for Columbia and RCA Victor Records, was published in September 2013.Fantagraphics website page for The High Fidelity Art of Jim Flora Chusid and Economon serve as co-archivists for the Flora collection, and produce a line of fine art prints of the artist's work.Jim Flora official web site In May 2009, Chusid and Economon teamed up with artist Drew Friedman to produce an exclusive line of limited edition fine art prints of the noted illustrator's works.Drew Friedman official web site ReferencesExternal links * Irwin Chusid's WFMU Radio Archives * WFMU: Irwin Chusid homepage * RaymondScott.net * Jim Flora Gallery * Songs in the Key of Z - outsider music project * Interview with Irwin Chusid, \\"Psalms in the Key of Z,\\" MungBeing.com * Interview with Irwin Chusid by Coury Turczyn, PopCult Magazine, 2005 * on WFMU, Spring 1999 Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:American radio DJs Category:American music journalists Category:Writers from Hoboken, New Jersey Category:Writers from Newark, New Jersey Category:University of Bridgeport alumni Category:Outsider music Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Jewish American journalists Category:American libertarians Category:American record producers ","title":"Irwin Chusid"},{"id":"1631133","title":"Prem Tinsulanonda"},{"id":"1631136","text":"West Wales West Wales () is not clearly defined as a particular region of Wales.

The two streams are North Chickamauga Creek and South Chickamauga Creek, joining the Tennessee from the north and south side, respectively. There is also a West Chickamauga Creek, which is a much longer tributary of the South Chickamauga Creek. Course The two Chickamauga Creeks are part of the Georgia, Middle Tennessee- Chickamauga Watershed. North Chickamauga Creek begins in an area called The Horseshoe, a portion of Walden Ridge, a branch of the Cumberland Plateau. The creek forms in southeastern Sequatchie County at the confluence of Standifer and Brimer creeks north of the community of Lone Oak, and runs entirely in Tennessee. South Chickamauga Creek is a long and winding valley-floor stream in the northwest corner of Georgia. It flows north from Ringgold, Georgia, over the border into Tennessee and from there into the city of Chattanooga. A major tributary of the South Chickamauga Creek is West Chickamauga Creek, which rises out of the confluence of Mud Creek and Mill Creek, and is joined by Brotherton Creek, just northeast of the Zahnd Wildlife Management Area between Rising Fawn and Lafayette in Walker County, Georgia. (Note: One EPA Watershed Report shows the West Chickamauga as rising out of the south end of Lookout Mountain, near Sandy Hollow.

The West Chickamauga flows northeast through Walker and Catoosa counties in Northwest Georgia, and forms the southeast border of the Chickamauga National Military Park in Chickamauga, Fort Oglethorpe and Ringgold, Georgia. It winds northeast to join the South Chickamauga Creek near Brown Acres Golf Course in eastern Hamilton County, Tennessee, just north of the Tennessee/Georgia border. West Chickamauga Creek can be navigated by kayak or canoe from near Gordon and Lee Mill (Chickamauga, GA) northeast, to where it joins with the South Chickamauga Creek, and from there northward to the Tennessee River at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Its mean annual flow velocity (estimate) is per second. HistoryChickamauga Indians= The tribal band of the Cherokee which settled near the creeks in the late 18th century became known as the Chickamauga. Under the leadership of Dragging Canoe, they became a frontier adversary to early American expansionism west of the Appalachian Mountains. =\\"Chickamauga\\" meaning= There is much discussion about the meaning of \\"Chickamauga\\". Although some experts say it translates to \\"River of Death\\", that name has no reference to the Battle of Chickamauga itself. =Battle of Chickamauga= During the Civil War, one of the bloodiest engagements of the war was fought near West Chickamauga Creek over control of the railroad center at nearby Chattanooga. The conflict became known as the Battle of Chickamauga, fought September 19‚Äì20, 1863. However, the creek itself had very little influence on the course of the battle. The first skirmishes of the battle were fought when Confederate troops attempted to cross the West Chickamauga Creek, especially at Alexander's Bridge and Reed's Bridge, near the southeast and northeast borders of the present-day Chickamauga National Military Park Union General William S. Rosecrans had established his army at Chickamauga, Georgia, southeast of Chattanooga. Confederate General Braxton Bragg had collected reinforcements and prepared to do battle, assisted by General James Longstreet. After two days of fighting, Rosecrans and a large portion of his army fled the field in disarray. The Battle of Chickamauga marked the end of the Union's \\"Chickamauga Campaign\\" in southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia, and cost Rosencrans his command.

He is often just referred to as Salvo Lima. According to the pentito (Mafia defector) Tommaso Buscetta, Lima‚Äôs father, Vincenzo Lima, was a member of the Mafia, but it is not known whether Lima himself was a \\"made member\\" of Cosa Nostra.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 221Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 285 In the final report of the first Italian Antimafia Commission (1963‚Äì1976) Lima was described as one of the pillars of Mafia power in Palermo. During his long career with the Christian Democracy (DC) that began in the 1950s, Lima was first allied with the faction of Amintore Fanfani and after 1964 with the one of Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister and a member of almost every post-war Italian government. That shift earned him a seat in the national parliament in 1968. Lima was often referred to as Andreotti's \\"proconsul\\" on Sicily. Under Andreotti Lima once held a cabinet post. At the time of his death he was a member of the European Parliament. Lima rarely spoke in public or campaigned during elections, but usually he would manage to gain large support from seemingly nowhere when it came to voting day. Mayor of Palermo From 1958 to 1963 Salvo Lima was mayor of Palermo, his birthplace, while his fellow Christian Democrat Vito Ciancimino was assessor for public works. L' impero siciliano di Salvo Lima & C., La Repubblica, November 14, 1986Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, pp. 55-56 Between 1951 and 1961 the population of Palermo had risen by 100,000. Under Lima and Ciancimino an unprecedented construction boom hit the city. They supported Mafia-allied building contractors such as Palermo‚Äôs leading construction entrepreneur Francesco Vassallo ‚Äì a former cart driver hauling sand and stone in a poor district of Palermo. Vassallo was connected to mafiosi like Angelo La Barbera and Tommaso Buscetta. In five years, over 4,000 building licences were signed, more than half of them in the names of three pensioners who had no connection with construction at all.Servadio, Mafioso, p. 204-06Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 21-22 This period was later referred to as the \\"Sack of Palermo\\" because the construction boom led to the destruction of the city's green belt, and villas that gave it architectural grace, to make way for characterless and shoddily constructed apartment blocks. In the meantime Palermo‚Äôs historical centre was allowed to crumble.Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, pp. 14-19 In 1964, during an investigation, Lima had to admit that he knew Angelo La Barbera, one of Palermo's most powerful mobsters.Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 21 Lima's election was supported by the La Barbera clan. From 1965-1968 Lima again was mayor of Palermo. Lima arranged an unusually lucrative concession to collect taxes in Sicily to Antonio Salvo and Ignazio Salvo, two wealthy mafia-cousins from the town of Salemi in the province of Trapani, in exchange for their loyalty to Salvo Lima and the Andreotti faction of the DC. The Salvo‚Äôs were allowed 10 percent of the take ‚Äì three times as much as the national average of 3.3 percent. Early Mafia connections According to the \\"pentito\\" (Mafia defector) Tommaso Buscetta, Lima‚Äôs father, Vincenzo Lima, was a \\"man of honour\\" of the Palermo Centro Mafia family that was led by Salvatore and Angelo La Barbera of which Buscetta's family ‚Äì the Porta Nuova Mafia family ‚Äì was part as well. The La Barbera brothers helped Salvo Lima getting elected. Buscetta himself met Salvo Lima many times and they became good friends. Every year Lima provided Buscetta with tickets for the Teatro Massimo in Palermo. I rapporti intrattenuti da Salvatore Lima con esponenti mafiosi Sentenza primo grado processo Andreotti di Palermo, 23 October 1999. At the time, the public and authorities did not know these connections. Buscetta only revealed facts about the relations between mafiosi and politicians after judge Giovanni Falcone was killed in 1992. However, already in 1964 one of Falcone‚Äôs predecessors, judge Cesare Terranova, unequivocally demonstrated Lima‚Äôs connections with the La Barberas. La discesa cominci√≤ con i pentiti, Corriere della Sera, March 13, 1992 In an indictment in 1964, Terranova wrote: \\"it is clear that Angelo and Salvatore La Barbera (well-known bosses in the Palermo area) ... knew former mayor Salvatore Lima and maintained relations in such a way as to ask for favours. ... The undeniable contacts of the La Barbera mafiosi with the one who was the first citizen of Palermo ... constitute a confirmation of ... the infiltration of the Mafia in several sectors of public life.\\"Indictment \\"Angelo La Barbera +42\\", June 23 1964 Nevertheless, Lima was allowed to continue in politics as if nothing had happened. Alliance with Andreotti Chamber of Deputies. In 1968 Lima was elected to the Chamber of Deputies (Italian: Camera dei Deputati), suddenly surpassing established politicians in Sicily. The alliance between Lima and Andreotti proved beneficial to both. Although Andreotti had a strong electoral base in and around Rome, his faction had no power base in the rest of Italy. With Lima, who at some time controlled 25 percent of all party members in Sicily, the Andreotti faction turned into a truly national group. While Andreotti had been an important government minister before his alliance with Lima, he now became one of the most powerful politicians in Italy. Andreotti became prime minister for the first time in 1972. In 1974 Lima became Under-Secretary of the Budget. In 1979 Lima was elected in the European Parliament. In 1981, Palermo witnessed the outbreak of a bloody Mafia war. A new dominant group within the Mafia, headed by Salvatore (Tot√≤) Riina, of Corleone, killed and replaced the traditional bosses of Palermo and their associates. The Corleonesi also turned against state representatives and politicians, such as the communist senator Pio La Torre, the Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa who had been appointed as the prefect of Palermo to fight the Mafia, and Rocco Chinnici, chief prosecutor in Palermo. A mounting public outcry demanded the Christian Democrats to clean up its house in Sicily. The mayor of Palermo, one of Lima's prot√©g√©s, was forced to resign, and Andreotti's Sicilian faction was on the defensive. At the Maxi Trial against the Mafia in the mid 1980s, two of Lima's closest allies, the cousins Nino and Ignazio Salvo, were convicted as members of the Mafia. When Lima was in Sicily he was allowed to the bulletproof car of the Salvo‚Äôs. Lima himself, however, never was part of a criminal investigation, because of the unwillingness of both witnesses and prosecutors. Mafia boss Tommaso Buscetta, whose testimonies as a collaborating witness during the Maxi Trial had been instrumental to convict many Mafia bosses, refused to talk about the relationship between Cosa Nostra and politicians. He told Giovanni Falcone one of the prosecutors at the Maxi Trial: \\"I have told you repeatedly that I would not discuss it until and if the time is ripe. It would be extremely foolish to discuss this subject - which is the crucial knot of the Mafia problem - while the very people whom we would be discussing remain fully active on the political scene.\\" The Court of Cassation (court of final appeal) ruled in October 2004 that Andreotti had \\"friendly and even direct ties\\" with top men in the so-called moderate wing of Cosa Nostra, Stefano Bontade and Gaetano Badalamenti, favoured by the connection between them and Salvo Lima. Killed by the Mafia The body of Salvo Lima. On 12 March 1992, 64-year-old Salvo Lima was on his way to Palermo in his chauffeur driven car when his tires were shot out by a gunman on a motorcycle.A Top Sicilian Politician Is Slain; Pre-Election Mafia Warning Seen, The New York Times, March 13, 1992 After his car screeched to a halt, Lima scrambled out and attempted to flee, but the assassin got off the motorbike, shot Lima in the back and then ran over and finished him off with a bullet to the neck. The killer then sped away. The killing took place three weeks before Italy's national election, billed as a watershed in Italian politics. The murder of Lima meant a turning point in the relations between the Mafia and its reference points in politics. The Mafia felt betrayed by Lima and Andreotti. In their opinion they had failed to block the confirmation of the sentence of the Maxi Trial by the Court of Cassation (court of final appeal) in January 1992, which upheld the Buscetta theorem that Cosa Nostra was a single hierarchical organisation ruled by a Commission and that its leaders could be held responsible for criminal acts that were committed to benefit the organisation. In September 1992, the Mafia murdered Ignazio Salvo, the prominent Mafia businessman who had been close to Lima.UCCISO IGNAZIO SALVO, L'INTOCCABILE - la Repubblica.it The Mafia had counted on Lima and Andreotti to appoint Corrado Carnevale to review the sentence. Carnevale, known as \\"the sentence killer\\", had overturned many Mafia convictions on the slenderest of technicalities previously. Carnevale, however, had to withdraw due to pressure from the public and from Giovanni Falcone ‚Äì who at the time had moved to the ministry of Justice. Falcone was backed by the minister of Justice Claudio Martelli despite the fact that he served under Prime Minister Andreotti.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 348-50 In 1998, several Mafia bosses were sentenced to life in prison for Lima's murder, including Salvatore Riina. Tommaso Buscetta, moved by the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, decided to break his long silence on ties between politics and Cosa Nostra. He acknowledged that he had known Lima since the late 1950s. On 16 November 1992 Buscetta testified before the Antimafia Commission presided by Luciano Violante about the links between Cosa Nostra and Salvo Lima and Giulio Andreotti. He indicated Salvo Lima as the contact of the Mafia in Italian politics. \\"Salvo Lima was, in fact, the politician to whom Cosa Nostra turned most often to resolve problems for the organisation whose solution lay in Rome,\\" Buscetta testified. Audizione del collaboratore della giustizia Tommaso Buscetta Other collaborating witnesses confirmed that Lima had been specifically ordered to \\"fix\\" the appeal of the Maxi Trial with Italy's Court of Cassation and had been murdered because he failed to do so. \\"I knew that for any problems requiring a solution in Rome, Lima was the man we turned to,\\" according to another pentito Gaspare Mutolo. \\"Lima was killed because he did not uphold or couldn‚Äôt uphold, the commitments he had made in Palermo (‚Ä¶) The verdict of the Supreme Court was disaster. After the Supreme Court verdict we felt we were lost. That verdict was like a dose of poison for the mafiosi, who felt like wounded animals. That‚Äôs why they carried out the massacres. Something had to happen. I was surprised when people who had eight years of a prison sentence still to serve started giving themselves up. Then they killed Lima and I understood.\\"All The Prime Minister's Men, by Alexander Stille, The Independent on Sunday, September 24, 1995Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 378-80Jamieson, The Antimafia, p. 56 According to Mutolo, \\"Lima was killed because he was the greatest symbol of that part of the political world which, after doing favours for Cosa Nostra in exchange for its votes, was no longer able to protect the interests of the organisation at the time of its most important trial.\\" Legacy Most sources regard the allegations of Lima being tied to the Mafia as true, although it must be pointed out that he was never formally charged or convicted of such allegations. In 1993 the Antimafia Commission led by senator Luciano Violante concluded that there were strong indications of relations between Lima and members of Cosa Nostra. \\"Lima became the prisoner of a system,\\" according to the pentito Leonardo Messina. \\"Before this latest generation, being a friend of mafiosi was easy for everybody‚Ä¶ It was a great honour for a mafioso to have a member of parliament at a wedding or a baptism‚Ä¶ When a mafioso saw a parliamentarian he would take off his hat and offer him a seat.\\" With the rise of power of the Corleonesi this changed profoundly. \\"Now, it has become an imposition: do this or else,\\" Messina said.Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 384 In 1998, in the trial for the murder of Lima, Giuseppe Cal√≤, Francesco Madonia, Bernardo Brusca, Salvatore Riina, Giuseppe Graviano, Pietro Aglieri, Salvatore Montalto, Giuseppe Montalto, Salvatore Buscemi, Nen√® Geraci, Raffaele Ganci, Giuseppe Farinella, Benedetto Spera, Antonino Giuffr√®, Salvatore Biondino, Michelangelo La Barbera, and Simone Scalici were sentenced to life imprisonment, while Salvatore Cancemi and Giovanni Brusca were sentenced to 18 years in prison and the collaborators of Justice Francesco Onorato and Giovan Battista Ferrante (who confessed to the crime) were sentenced to 13 years as material perpetrators of the ambush.Italian Mafia bosses get life sentences, BBC News, 15 July 1998Processo Lima: 18 ergastoli ai padrini di Cosa Nostra Corriere della Sera, 16 luglio 1998 In 2003, the Cassation annulled the sentence to life imprisonment for Pietro Aglieri, Giuseppe Farinella, Giuseppe Graviano and Benedetto Spera.Omicidio Lima: annullati gli ergastoli a 4 boss - Corriere.it Electoral history {class=wikitable style=\\"width:62%; border:1px #AAAAFF solid\\" - ! width=12%Election ! width=25%House ! width=34%Constituency ! width=5% colspan=\\"2\\"Party ! width=12%Votes ! width=12%Result - ! 1968    bgcolor=\\"\\"   DC  80,387  Elected - ! 1972    bgcolor=\\"\\"   DC  84,755  Elected - ! 1976    bgcolor=\\"\\"   DC  100,792  Elected - ! 1979  European Parliament  Italian Islands  bgcolor=\\"\\"   DC  305,308  Elected - ! 1984  European Parliament  Italian Islands  bgcolor=\\"\\"   DC  256,633  Elected - ! 1989  European Parliament  Italian Islands  bgcolor=\\"\\"   DC  246,912  Elected } References *Dickie, John (2004).

It was established in September 2001. Sixth College's core writing program is called Culture, Art and Technology (CAT). The series is a 5-course sequence that integrates writing skills into multidisciplinary classes to examine the intersections of Culture, Art, and Technology. Name The Visual Arts Facility and Pepper Canyon Hall Sixth College is so named because it is the sixth undergraduate college at UCSD. As per university tradition, it uses a numerical name until it gets a proper name, which will occur in the order that the colleges are created. The names of prominent persons who fit the college's theme of Culture, Art, and Technology, such as Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, and Chester Cesolini, have been proposed by students but never seriously considered by the administration. The naming process has been stopped indefinitely. Ethos and philosophy Sixth College prepares students to become effective global citizens who engage creatively and ethically with the complex issues facing the world in the 21st century. Through the college's academic and co- curricular programs, students learn to become innovative, aware, and interconnected. The college draws its creative inspiration through the interdisciplinary examination of culture, art and technology. Core academic programs develop skills in both traditional and emergent media literacy, emphasizing essential writing fundamentals as well as the latest forms of digital communication. The core sequence in Culture, Art and Technology develops students' abilities to explore the richness of intellectual and academic multiplicity, write effectively, ask and examine difficult questions, work with multiple media and sensory experiences, collaborate in teams, consider ethical issues, develop digital literacy, and explore art and technology in a cultural context. Extending beyond the classroom, Sixth College educates the student as a whole person. The college community understands the importance of student life in education, and works to integrate academic development with personal growth, community service, interpersonal experience, conscious communication, and ethical behavior. The totality of Sixth College is a digital educational ecology that fosters new forms of thought, expression and community for a new millennium. =Experiential learning= Sixth College is committed to experiential learning on many different levels. The Practicum is a unique upper-division requirement that promotes civic engagement and global consciousness, and embodies the College's commitment to active, experiential learning. It is designed to assist students in preparing their professional portfolios and refining their presentation skills as they prepare to enter the post-graduate world. Beginning in 2012, Sixth College has hosted the biannual Experiential Learning Conference. Sixth College is also the only college at UC San Diego with an explicit upper division Practicum requirement which can be satisfied by many different types of experiential learning opportunities including: study abroad programs, study at UCDC, various types of service-learning in the community, directed research with faculty members, internship programs, and specially-designed independent study programs. The paramount aim is to provide a learning community that is nurturing and stimulating, while equipping students to face the challenges that lie ahead. General education In addition to the Culture, Art, and Technology (CAT) core writing program, all Sixth College students are required to take on an upper division Practicum course, unique to all the colleges at UCSD. The program requires students to enroll in courses that demand a hands-on approach to education while making valuable contributions to communities both locally and abroad. Students must choose a 4-unit course, program, internship, or research opportunity for their Practicum Project that develops both their academic and professional skills. Along with the Practicum, every student is required to complete Sixth College's upper-division writing course, CAT 125. This course gives students the opportunity to reflect upon the relationship between their service and their coursework, and to increase their mastery of the written and spoken word. Student life The student council at Sixth College is known as SCSC. This Sixth College Student Council heads the many committees that are responsible for many major Sixth events in the academic year. These include Spirit of the Masters (Arts Committee), CHAOS (Culture Committee), Kuncocshun (Festival Committee), Winter Game Fest (Tech Committee), and Spirit Night (Spirit Committee). The SCSC also has positions for members of the Sixth College Judicial Board. Other student organizations include Action Vibe, Community Board (Co-Board), Sixth College Television (SCTV), The Sixth Sense (an investigative journal), Sixer Tritons and Recreation for Transfers (START), and Video Production Club (VPC). Sixth College also has an ambassador program, for students who strive to increase Sixth College students' sense of belonging and connectedness to the community. Sixth College's dining hall is known as Foodworx. Sixth Place and Market, a convenience store, is located nearby. =On-campus housing= The courtyard of Sixth Apartments On-campus housing is available at Sixth College for two years. Sixth College dormitories are located near Pepper Canyon Hall. The dorms are nicknamed \\"Camp Snoopy\\" as the trees, central lawn, and cabin-like dormitory buildings all contribute to the appearance of a youth summer camp. The dorms are arranged in multiple two- story buildings, with approximately sixty students per building (thirty per floor). Each floor is further divided into two suites, each consisting of five rooms and a common room. A shared bathroom connects the two suites. Each building also features a kitchen and study room for use by residents of that building. The other on-campus housing option are Sixth's apartments (sometimes referred to by their old name from when they were part of Fifth College, \\"Pepper Canyon Apartments\\"). Housing is available exclusively for black students at the African Black Diaspora Living-Learning Community at Sixth College. =Commuter life= Sixth College has several resources for commuters. Sixth College commuter students have unlimited access to the Commuter Center located in Pepper Canyon Hall, which features lockers, WiFi, and kitchen facilities. Sixth College also has a commuter student organization known as Commuters in Action, or CIA. Each quarter, Sixth College also hosts Commuter and Transfer social events. Notable events Conan O'Brien during his visit to Sixth College in 2012. Mayim Bialik during her visit to Sixth College in 2015. On April 20, 2012, late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien visited Sixth College in honor of its tenth anniversary. To celebrate the occasion, and in the absence of a permanent name, Sixth College renamed itself to Conan O'Brien College for the day of April 20. On May 27, 2015, actress Mayim Bialik visited Sixth College in honor of its thirteen anniversary. =Experiential Learning Conference= The Experiential Learning Conference is a biannual event occurring in early Winter quarter (late January), and is free and open to the public.

While not today an administrative entity in itself, Czech Silesia is, together with Bohemia and Moravia, one of the three historical Czech lands. In this context, it is often mentioned simply as \\"Silesia\\", even though it is only around one tenth of the area of the historic land of Silesia. Silesia lies within the north-east of the Czech Republic, predominantly in the Moravian-Silesian Region, with a section in the northern Olomouc Region. It is almost identical in extent with the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, also known as Austrian Silesia before 1918; between 1938 and 1945, part of the area was also alluded to as Sudeten Silesia (, , , , ): a reference to the Sudetenland. Geography Czech Silesia now lies across several of the northern regions Czech Silesia borders Moravia in the south, Poland (Polish Silesia) in the north (in the northwest the County of Kladsko, until 1742/48 an integral part of Bohemia) and Slovakia in the southeast. With the city of Ostrava roughly in its geographic center, the area comprises much of the modern region of Moravian-Silesia (save for its southern edges) and, in its far west, a small part of the Olomouc Region around the city of Jesen√≠k. After Ostrava, the most important cities are Opava and ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n. Historically ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n is the western part of the city of Cieszyn which nowadays lies in Poland. Situated in the Sudetes, it is cornered by the Carpathians in the east. Its major rivers are the Oder (Polish, ), Opava and Ol≈°e () (which forms part of the natural border with Poland). History Modern-day Czech Silesia derives primarily from a small part of Silesia that remained within the Bohemian Crown and the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the First Silesian War in 1742, when the rest of Silesia was ceded to Prussia. It was re-organised as the Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia, with its capital at Opava (, ). In 1900, the Duchy occupied an area of 5,140 km¬≤ and had a population of 670,000. In 1918, the former Duchy formed part of the newly created state of Czechoslovakia, except the Cieszyn Silesia, which was split between Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1920, Czechoslovakia gaining its western portion. Hluƒç√≠n Region (, ), formerly part of Prussian Silesia, also became part of Czechoslovakia under the Treaty of Versailles in 1920. Following the Munich Agreement of 1938, most of Czech Silesia became part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland and Poland occupied the Zaolzie area on the west bank of the Olza (the Polish gains being lost when Germany occupied Poland the following year). With the exception of the areas around Cieszyn, Ostrava, and Hluƒç√≠n, Czech Silesia was predominantly settled by German-speaking populations up until 1945. Following the Second World War, Czech Silesia and Hluƒç√≠nsko were returned to Czechoslovakia and the ethnic Germans were expelled. The border with Poland was once again set along the Olza (although not confirmed by treaty until 1958). People The population mainly speaks Czech with altered vowels. Some of the native Slavic population speak Lach, which is classed by Ethnologue as a dialect of Czech, although it also shows some similarities to Polish. In Cieszyn Silesia a unique dialect is also spoken, mostly by members of the Polish minority there. Notable people from Czech Silesia include: * Martin of Opava (Martinus Polonus) (‚Ä†1278), chronicler, chaplain of several popes * Ji≈ô√≠ T≈ôanovsk√Ω (1592‚Äì1637), pastor and hymnwriter, the \\"Luther of the Slavs\\" * Heinrich Franz Boblig von Edelstadt (c. 1612‚Äì1698), egregious inquisitor * David Zeisberger (1721‚Äì1808), Moravian Missionary in North America and \\"Apostle to the Indians\\" * Gregor Mendel (1822‚Äì1884), biologist, founder of genetics (inheritance laws) * Hans Kudlich (1823‚Äì1917), politician, main figure in the struggle for abolition of serfdom in Austrian Empire * Pawe≈Ç Stalmach (1824‚Äì1891), journalist and national revivalist * Vincenc Prasek (1843‚Äì1912), historian * Johann Palisa (1848‚Äì1925), astronomer * Petr Bezruƒç (1867‚Äì1958), poet * Josef Ko≈ædon (1873‚Äì1949), politician, leader of Silesian autonomists, proponent of the idea of a distinct Silesian nation (\\"Slonzaks\\") * Helen Zelezny-Scholz (1882‚Äì1974), architectural sculptor * √ìndra ≈Åysohorsky (1905‚Äì1989), poet, creator of the literary form of the Lach dialect * Joy Adamson (Friederike Victoria Gessner) (1910‚Äì1980), writer * Franti≈°ek Vl√°ƒçil (1924‚Äì1999), film director and screenwriter * Armin Delong (1925‚Äì2017), physicist specializing in electron microscopy * Vƒõra Chytilov√° (1929‚Äì2014), film director and screenwriter * Jarom√≠r Nohavica (1953‚Äì), songwriter and poet * Iva Bittov√° (1958‚Äì), avant- garde violinist, singer, and composer * Ivan Lendl (1960‚Äì), tennis player, longtime world #1 and winner of eight Grand Slam titles (finalist of nineteen) * Leon Koudelak (1961‚Äì) classical guitarist References Silesia Category:Geography of the Moravian-Silesian Region Category:Geography of the Olomouc Region Silesia Category:Historical regions ","title":"Czech Silesia"},{"id":"1631184","text":"Bromley South railway station is on the Chatham main line in England, serving the town centre and high street of Bromley, south-east London.

The film was directed by Alan Clarke and written by Trevor Preston. The BFI has described it as \\"undoubtedly the only vampire snooker musical in cinema history\\". Plot Billy the Kid is a young, up-and-coming snooker player. His manager, T.O. (The One), a compulsive gambler, falls into debt with psychopathic loanshark the Wednesday Man, who offers to cancel T.O's debt if he can arrange a 17-frame grudge snooker match between Billy and the reigning world champion Maxwell Randall (popularly known as the Green Baize Vampire). To ensure that both players will agree to the match, T.O hires a journalist, Miss Sullivan, to stir up trouble between them. She interviews Billy and the Vampire separately, asks them leading questions intended to elicit angry responses and provoke enmity, then prints the results. The match is set. Unknown to T.O., the Wednesday Man has hidden motives regarding the match. The sinister loanshark has engineered a clause in the game's legal documentation to the effect that the loser will agree to never play professional snooker again. Though the Vampire is close to retirement, Billy is young, and such a clause‚Äîif he loses‚Äîwould greatly disadvantage him. T.O. only agrees when the Wednesday Man suggests that the Vampire will \\"not be at his best\\"; a clear insinuation that he will be bribed, or threatened. It is only later that T.O. discovers that this is a lie and that the Wednesday Man is plotting with the Vampire, hates both him and Billy, and wishes to see them suffer. The match goes very badly for Billy, but when T.O. finally confesses, during a break, of his underhand dealings with the Wednesday Man (and the Vampire himself) he manages to pull himself together and eventually win the match.

Reception Film critic, Geoff Andrew, has stated that the film is arguably Alan Clarke's \\"best\\". Critic Michael Brooke stated that 'a critical and commercial failure that has since picked up a modest cult following, Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire undoubtedly deserves plaudits for sheer originality: for all its many faults, it was the first and will almost certainly remain the only vampire snooker musical ever made.' Brooke also commented that 'the cast gave it their all' with 'Phil Daniels (then approaching the end of his surprisingly short-lived career as a major big- screen star) and Alun Armstrong' fleshing 'out the title characters with memorable vigour' and Bruce Payne giving the \\"stand out performance\\" in the film.

The craft was named after the niece of senator and later United States President, James Buchanan; during his presidency, she acted as First Lady. The cutter was christened and entered the water for the Revenue Service in 1859 out of New York City, and saw action during the Civil War at Fort Sumter, New Orleans, Galveston, Texas, and Virginia Point. The Confederates captured her in 1863, whereupon she was converted to mercantile service. Union forces recaptured her at the end of war. The US Navy declared her unfit for service and sold her. New owners out of Philadelphia renamed her Elliot Ritchie.. Her crew abandoned her at sea in 1881. Layout of the ship Plans of Harriet Lane Harriet Lane measured 177.5 feet long, 30.5 feet wide and 12 feet from the bottom of the hull to the main deck. Her propulsion was a double-right-angled marine engine with two side paddles, supported by two masts; the entire ship was sheathed and fastened with copper. From stern to bow, the captain's cabin and stateroom sat above an aft magazine, forward of which was a second magazine with the officer quarters above. Forward of this, in the midships was the engine machinery and coal supply, and beyond this the quarters and galley for the non-commissioned ranks which sat above a third magazine. Her initial armaments were described as \\"light guns\\", however after joining the West Gulf Squadron her firepower was upgraded somewhat: one four-inch rifled Parrott gun to the forecastle, one nine-inch Dahlgren gun before the first mast, two eight-inch Dahlgren Columbiads and two twenty-four-pound brass howitzers. Her crew of 95 were also issued small arms. CareerWith the Union= Paraguay Squadron (Harper's Weekly, New York, October 16, 1858). Harriet Lane, built for the Treasury Department by William H. Webb, was launched in New York City, November 1857. She was a copper-plated steamer that could make speeds of up to eleven knots. Her battery consisted of three thirty-two-pounders and four twenty-four-pound howitzers. She served as a revenue cutter until temporarily transferred to the Navy late in 1858. Her new assignment took her to Paraguay with a squadron ordered to support the discussions of U.S. Special Commissioner James B. Bowlin with Dictator Carlos Antonio L√≥pez concerning reparations for damages incurred during an unprovoked attack on by the Paraguayan forces, February 1, 1855. This display of sea power quickly won the United States a prompt and respectful hearing which four years of diplomacy had failed to obtain. Paraguay apologized, paid an indemnity to compensate the family of an American seaman killed during the fight, and signed a new commercial treaty containing provisions highly advantageous to the United States. In his report, Flag Officer William B. Shubrick singled out Harriet Lane for special commendation on the invaluable service she rendered in extricating his other ships that repeatedly ran aground in the treacherous waters of the Paran√° River. Returning to the United States, Harriet Lane resumed her former duties as a revenue cutter. Captain John A. Faunce, USRCS was commanding officer.U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office.

On 5 June 1861 Harriet Lane, commanded by Captain John A. Faunce, USRCS; engaged Confederate forces in the Battle of Pig Point Virginia. Her next important service came the following summer when a task force was sent against Fort Clark and Fort Hatteras on the outer banks of North Carolina to check blockade running in the area. The ships sailed from Hampton Roads August 26, 1861, for the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries, the first important combined amphibious operation of the war. The next morning, Harriet Lane, , and slipped close inshore to provide direct support to the landings, while heavier ships pounded the forts from deeper water. The last resistance was snuffed out the following afternoon, giving a badly needed boost to morale in the North, which had been disheartened a month before by defeat in the First Battle of Bull Run. Of greater importance was the fact that this combined operation opened the inland waterways to Union ships and gave the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron a base deep in Southern waters. Harriet Lane ran aground while attempting to enter Pamlico Sound through Hatteras Inlet on August 29 and suffered severe damage while fast on the shoal. She was refloated at the cost of her armament, rigging, stores, provisions, and everything else on board that could be heaved over the side to lighten ship. Temporary repairs completed on September 3, she proceeded to Hampton Roads, arriving September 8, 1861. Harriet Lane sailed February 10, 1862, to join Commander David Dixon Porter's Mortar Flotilla at Key West, where units were assembling for an attack on Confederate forts in the Mississippi River Delta below New Orleans. Comdr. Porter embarked at Washington. During her passage to Hampton Roads, Harriet Lane was taken under fire by the Confederate battery at Shipping Point, Virginia, which inflicted such damage to her port wheel that her departure for Key West was delayed another two days. On February 24 she captured the Confederate schooner Joanna Ward off Florida. Harriet Lane then targeted the Confederate fleets in Louisiana and Texas as part of the West Gulf Squadron under the command of Commodore Farragut, a duty for which her firepower was upgraded as mentioned above. Commanded by Commander Jonathan M. Wainwright and Lieutenant Commander Edward Lea at this point, she was used as Farragut's flagship until he transferred to the Hartford on January 20. She was then ordered to join a fleet under the command of Captain David D. Porter at the mouth of the Mississippi River. On March 4, 1862, this fleet moved to attack Confederate forts south of New Orleans in the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, advancing up the river and engaging Fort Jackson on April 18 and passing it on April 24, with New Orleans falling the next day. Harriet Lane was sent on June 29, 1862, to attack the Vicksburg batteries. Farragut ordered the Mortar Flotilla to Ship Island May 1, and Harriet Lane continued to Pensacola, Florida, where she transported Brigadier General Lewis G. Arnold's troops from Fort Pickens to the other side of the bay, where they occupied Forts Barrancas and McRee, Barancas Barracks, and the Navy Yard which had been abandoned by the Confederates. Back at Ship Island for repairs May 30, Harriet Lane prepared to ascend the Mississippi with Porter's mortar boats to engage enemy batteries on the cliffs of Vicksburg, Mississippi, while Farragut ran past this river stronghold to join Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis in an effort to clear the entire Mississippi Valley of obstructions to Union shipping. However, sufficient ground forces to take Vicksburg were not made available, nullifying the value of his operation, and after a frustrating encounter with the new Confederate ironclad ram Arkansas, Farragut ran back down past Vicksburg while Harriet Lane and her sister vessels in the Mortar Flotilla again covered the dash by bombarding the Confederate batteries 15 July. In September, she was sent to Galveston, Texas as part of a blockade fleet under the command of Commodore Eagle, whose flagship was too large to enter the river and was subsequently relieved of command on October 1. On October 4, Harriet Lane advanced into Galveston Harbor and participated in a small exchange with the rebel Fort Point and shore batteries, known as the First Battle of Galveston Harbor. On October 9 Union marines landed to raise the United States flag, and the key to the city was given to the captain of Harriet Lane, Captain Wainright.Gussley, \\"Yankee Notebook\\" published in Galveston News, by W. P. Doran Union forces from the ships occupied the town, but fell back to the docks every night as Confederate cavalry entered the town every evening. The ships bombarded the town at regular intervals. In the early morning of January 1, 1863, with almost all ships, including Harriet Lane, anchored in the channel, an alarm was raised reporting Confederate forces approaching. With only the Westfield ready to maneuver, she sailed upriver in an attempt to engage the approaching Confederate vessels. The Westfield grounded, but the attack was reckoned to be merely a retreat by Confederate ships, and the alarm was cancelled. There was, however, a Confederate land force under the command of General John B. Magruder that was approaching Galveston. At four o'clock that morning, in what would come to be known as the Battle of Galveston, the reoccupied Confederate forts opened fire on the Union fleet while ground troops attempted to board the anchored ships. The late arrival of a Confederate fleet enabled the troops to board the Harriet Lane, which was raked by gunfire and rammed, leaving Wainright dead and Lea mortally wounded. In one of the war's most poignant incidents, when Lea was mortally wounded, his father, Confederate Major Albert M. Lea was serving ashore in Galveston. He came aboard the Harriet Lane only to realize his son was near death. =With the Confederacy= Artist's depiction of the capture of Harriet Lane, January 1, 1863 During the Battle of Galveston, Harriet Lane sank the Rebel tugboat Neptune, leaving one-half of the two-vessel Confederate fleet lying on the bottom of the harbor. However, the Confederate gunboat circled and made a second run on Harriet Lane. At daybreak, Harriet Lane was listing steeply, and a boat was dispatched from her side to the remaining Union ships to negotiate a surrender.H. S. Lubbock's Deposition before Prize Commissioners, 1863 During the negotiations, Harriet Lane was further damaged by fire from the Union Owasco under a flag of truce in an attempt to explode her magazine. The flagship Westfield was later exploded, and the remaining Union ships fled to New Orleans, leaving Harriet Lane, along with a copy of the United States signal service code book in her cabin, in Confederate hands. The capture of Harriet Lane was an interesting episode of the Civil War, as it possibly involved the youngest combatant of the American Civil War. According to an account by a captured member of the Confederate boarding party: > Amongst the first men struck down were the gallant Captain Wainwright and > Lieutenant Lee, who both fought with desperation and valor. One young son of > Captain Wainwright, just ten years old, stood at the cabin door with a > revolver in each hand and never ceased firing until he had expended every > shot. The capture of the Harriet Lane involved also possibly the oldest active combatant of the Civil War. Captain Levi C. Harby of the Texas Maritime Service, 69 years old, was in command of the Neptune, and was the last to leave that vessel after ramming the Harriet Lane portside. The Neptune was hit by Federal gunners and sank, but the water was shallow enough that Harby and his men could continue firing their guns from her deck. This distraction enabled the Bayou City to carry out the successful starboard attack that captured the Harriet Lane. After a week of repairs, Harriet Lane was placed under the command of Captain Thomas C. Saunders and dispatched to fight the Union vessels at sea, despite lengthy legal discussions regarding the capture of the prize which had not yet drawn to a close. As a result, the ship was taken farther upriver and stripped of weapons to lighten her load. Lieutenant Joseph Nicholson Barney of the Confederate States Navy was dispatched command her and additional vessels in Galvestone, however the ship as already under command of Leon Smith, an army volunteer and steamboat captain, who had played a role in capturing the ship, having been placed in command of the ship by Major General John B. Magruder and in control of additional ships improvised as a \\"cottonclad fleet\\". The ship was also considered by the navy to be too slow and inefficient to become a blockade runner. Barney conceded the appointment, and in a letter to Confederate naval secretary Stephen Mallory recommended that the navy relinquish control. Barney later explained that he made his recommendation since he considered that the presence of two separate marine forces with independent commanders would lead to discord and confusion.Day, James M.

Pierpaoli, William, page 285 Recapture and sale Harriet Lane was declared unfit for naval service. She was refitted with a bark (barque) rig and renamed Elliot Ritchie, and operated out of Philadelphia and Boston, transporting coal and merchandise. In 1881 a fire broke out in one of her cargo holds and she was abandoned at sea.

Eriksen was leader of the Danish Liberal party Venstre from 1950 to 1965. He served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 30 October 1950 to 30 September 1953 as leader of the Eriksen cabinet forming a minority government of Venstre and the Conservative People's Party. Eriksen was a farmer by profession. The main accomplishment by his government was a revision of the Danish constitution, voted into law in a referendum held in 1953 simultaneously with the parliamentary elections. In addition, a family allowance law was passed in 1952, along with other reforms during Eriksen's time as prime minister. The Rent Act of June 1951, while permitting certain rent increases, extended rent control and security of tenure to cover houses constructed after 1939. In addition, the Public Assistance Act of March 1953 introduced special treatment and assistance for patients with polio. The former Venstre leader and former Prime Minister Knud Kristensen had broken away from Venstre to form his own party, De Uafh√¶ngige. This was one of reasons why the social democrat Hans Hedtoft was able to secure the parliamentary support to replace Eriksen as Prime Minister and form the Hedtoft cabinet. After 1953, Eriksen continued as the leader of the opposition but in the long run his consequent alliance with the Conservatives proved an obstacle to a co-operation with the Radical Left Party. He therefore resigned as the leader of his party in 1965 and was succeeded by Poul Hartling.

Background Romanian liberal radicals of Ploie»ôti and elsewhere were opposed to the new ruler of the country, Prince Carol of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen (future King of Romania), and desired a republic to replace the monarchy established by the 1866 Constitution - the main argument being that a new constitutional system, viewed as more democratic, was to put an end to the partnership between the monarch and the Conservatives (which had effectively blocked the Liberals out of government). Although many Liberals had contributed to the creation of the \\"monstrous coalition\\" (which had toppled Alexandru Ioan Cuza on February 22 (February 11 O.S.), 1866), the deep resentment of Carol's politics, added to the perception that he had remained a foreigner linked to Prussia, had initially led to republican projects advocated by both the most left-wing Liberal faction (the \\"Reds\\", led by C. A. Rosetti) and the Liberal leader Ion BrƒÉtianu, and ultimately led to \\"coup d'√©tat plans\\". At the same time, for many lower-level plotters, Cuza had arguably conserved his status image as both an anti-establishment social reformer and, given that his rule had preceded the Constitution, a quasi- republican political figure. Other, less prominent, factors included the revolutionary tradition inside the Liberal groups (see: 1848 Moldavian Revolution and 1848 Wallachian Revolution), as well as the persistence of French models in Liberal rhetoric. Although references to French republicanism itself had been moving out of focus after the replacement of the Second French Republic with the Empire, the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July fueled the Liberals' resentment of Prussia. The leader of the Ploie»ôti Liberals was Captain Alexandru Candiano-Popescu, who, in 1867, as the owner of the newspaper \\"Perseveren≈£a\\", had been arrested and had his newspaper shut down for anti-Carol articles which were interpreted as libel. Earlier in 1870, when he was arrested for publishing articles in the newspaper \\"Democra≈£ia\\". The conspiracy On August 8, two secret meetings of the Liberals were organized and Candiano-Popescu announced that he had information from Bucharest that the monarchy would be overthrown the next night, that all major cities were preparing for a revolt, and that a Romanian Republic would be proclaimed. He also assured them that the Republican movement had the support of major European powers and as such there would be no foreign invasion in support of Carol. Candiano-Popescu announced that he was to serve as the new prefect of Prahova County, and that Stan Popescu would be the new chief of the Ploie≈üti police; further roles in the planned administration were assigned to each of the plotters. That night everything went as planned: the chief of police and the Prefect were arrested, the telegraph station was occupied by Comiano and Gu≈£ƒÉ Antonescu, and Candiano-Popescu occupied the firehouse, wearing his captain's uniform \\"to look like he has more authority\\". Just before dawn, Candiano-Popescu, armed with a revolver and with the help of another 40-50 persons, captured the telegraph operator, Grigore Iorgulescu. Although the latter was put under strict supervision, a couple of hours later his guards were inebriated, and he was able to send a telegram to Prime Minister Manolache Costache Epureanu's residence in Bucharest, asking what the situation was there (fearing that the coup had taken hold of the capital). The answer was that everything was calm and that there was nothing unusual happening. Iorgulescu then notified Epureanu of what had happened in Ploie≈üti. Meanwhile, the plotters, who had occupied the post office, sent a telegram to Bucharest announcing that Prefect Candiano had the allegiance of the Ploie≈üti civilian administration and the military. On the evening of 9 August, soldiers from Bucharest arrived at the Ploie≈üti train station and arrested the new \\"administration\\", most of whom declared that they were not actually revolting, thinking it was just a party. Aftermath Thirty-six of the leaders of the movement were accused of \\"revolt against the government\\". Many other leaders of the Liberals, including Ion BrƒÉtianu, Nicolae Golescu, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Nicolae Cre≈£ulescu, were arrested under suspicion of having backed the conspiracy. The trials of the civilians who took part in the revolt were eventually moved to T√¢rgovi≈üte and, on October 17, 1870, they were found not guilty. Republican projects faded out of the forefront during the following decade, when BrƒÉtianu and Carol reached a compromise which inaugurated a virtually unchallenged Liberal supremacy between 1876 (when BrƒÉtianu became premier) and 1889. On the one hand, the monarchy was consolidated with Liberal approval (the creation of the Romanian Kingdom in 1881); on the other, the Constitution was amended in 1883 to accommodate an electoral reform which extended representation and increased the voting power of Liberal electors. Caragiale The mundane aspects of the Ploie≈üti republican experiment became the subject of derision in literary circles associated with the conservative Junimea. Satires dealing with or alluding to the episode were created by Ion Luca Caragiale, who often used his prose to mock the bombastic tone of the Liberal press. In his piece Boborul, Caragiale actually records the events, revisiting his experiences as a seventeen-year-old eyewitness (and makes some unverifiable claims, such as having been created a deputy police commissioner by Candiano-Popescu, the latter being \\"president of the Republic\\"). His ironic account, centered on scenes of excessive drinking and a f√™te atmosphere, implies that the Republic would have actually functioned as a separate country: > \\"In the space of our century, a very interesting state was born and ended, > one that no scrupulous historian should ignore. I wish to speak of the > Ploie≈üti Republic, a state which, although it has lasted only fifteen hours, > has for sure marked a celebrated page in contemporary history. Born out of, > through, and for the people, at around two o'clock in the morning of August > 8, 1870, the young republic was smothered on the same day, around four > o'clock in the afternoon. Never mind! the greatness and importance of states > are not judged by their extent and duration, but by the more or less > brilliant role they have played in the universal system.\\" The word Boborul itself has since acquired popularity in Romania, and is used to ridicule perceived demagogy and its rhetoric. Its exact use in the piece forms the climax of the short plot, during the depiction of what Caragiale calls \\"The Reaction\\". After having fallen asleep at his desk, the hungover Stan Popescu is rudely awaken by the group of officers charged with bringing back order, and answers to the short and direct question \\"Who has placed you here?\\" with the mumbled \\"boborul\\" (from poporul - \\"the people\\"; translatable as \\"the beoble\\"). Another famous reference introduced by Caragiale is D-ale carnavalului (\\"Carnival Adventures\\"), where Mi≈£a Baston, a hysterical woman, snaps at the man she believes is cheating on her: > \\"Yes, [...] I want to cause a scandal, yes... since you have forgotten me, > you have forgotten everything: you have forgotten that I am a daughter of > the people and that I am violent; you have forgotten that I am a republican, > that in my veins runs the blood of February 11 martyrs [in reference to the > deposition of Prince Cuza]; [...] you have forgotten that I am a Ploie≈üti > native -- yes, a Ploie≈üti native -- buddy, and I shall pull you a > revolution, but not just any revolution... one to remember me by!...\\" Further pokes at the Liberals are taken in Conu Leonida fa≈£ƒÉ cu reac≈£iunea (\\"Mr. Leonida Faces the Reaction\\"), a play centered on Leonida and his wife Efimi≈£a, an elderly and radical couple of the Bucharest petite bourgeoisie who, when listening to the noise of a street brawl while tucked into bed, interpret it to mean the start of a coup d'√©tat against the Liberal government. Believing that, on some level, he would have to suffer the consequences of \\"The Reaction\\", Mr. Leonida hatches out an escape plan: > \\"We'll walk to the train station on the other side of Ci≈ümigiu, and sometime > till morning we'll catch the train to Ploie≈üti... There, I shan't be afraid > anymore: I'll be among my own kind! all of them republicans, poor souls!\\" Such harsh criticism was denied basis by several literary figures of another generation, those left-wing intellectuals centered on Poporanism, who viewed radicalism as traditional and important in the development of Romanian culture. In his Spiritul critic √Æn cultura rom√¢neascƒÉ, Garabet IbrƒÉileanu depicted Caragiale as standing for the most extreme criticism of Romanian society, together with the more conservative Mihai Eminescu and the more leftist intellectuals associated with the Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party. Although he considered Boborul to be a good piece of writing, he accused Caragiale of remaining one-sided: \\"and [what about] the reactionary attitude, does it never lend itself to ridicule?\\" See also *Liberalism and radicalism in Romania References *Republica de la Ploie≈üti on the Ploie≈üti Municipality site; accessed March 21, 2005 *I.

Liquor is most famous for his appearances on The Ren & Stimpy Show. He is considered Kricfalusi's signature character and was a mascot for Kricfalusi's defunct animation studio, Sp√ºmc√∏. Kricfalusi portrayed George Liquor as a patriotic, outspoken, politically conservative blowhard. Kricfalusi described Liquor as his favorite character to animate. George Liquor was voiced by Harris Peet in his first starring episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show. Liquor was voiced by Michael Pataki until the latter's death in 2010 with his last voice work for the character posthumously featured in Cans Without Labels. Kricfalusi has voiced the character himself subsequently. George Liquor appeared in episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show, the episodes of The Goddamn George Liquor Program, comic books, webcomics, internet cartoons, and advertisements. According to Kricfalusi's blog, a new webtoon starring George was in development and to be sponsored by Pontiac Vibe, but the series remained unreleased when the Pontiac Vibe was discontinued in 2009. Personality Kricfalusi described George Liquor as \\"the greatest American\\" who is so conservative \\"that he thinks the Republicans are commies\\". George harbors a deep antipathy for the political left; in one issue of Sp√ºmc√∏'s Comic Book, George Liquor becomes enraged after a fish calls him a Democrat. According to Kricfalusi's \\"George Liquor Story Bible\\", George is a middle-aged, crass, religious, ultra-patriotic American who favors his nephew, Jimmy The Idiot Boy, and tries to teach Jimmy how to be a \\"real man\\". Liquor lives in the fictional city of Decentville, USA. George strongly believes in discipline and corporal punishment; his motto is \\"it's discipline that begets love\\". In the two episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show in which he starred, George treats Ren and Stimpy strictly and tries to make them as disciplined as possible. In an issue of Comic Book, Liquor questions how parents can love their children without spanking them. Creation George was created by Kricfalusi in 1979 immediately after Kricfalusi saw a building with a sign that read, \\"George Liquor\\". Kricfalusi said that the name \\"George Liquor\\" was \\"the coolest name [he] ever heard\\". According to Kricfalusi's blog, Kricfalusi's father greatly influenced the character's personality. He said that both Liquor and his father are similar in that \\"George and my Dad believe strongly in discipline and order and rules. (Especially their own!)\\" Kricfalusi intended for George Liquor to be an integral character in The Ren & Stimpy Show; Kricfalusi created Ren and Stimpy as Liquor's and Jimmy's pets. On The Ren and Stimpy Show George Liquor's first official appearances were in episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show, a cartoon series that Kricfalusi created, sold to the television channel Nickelodeon, and directed at his studio Sp√ºmc√∏. Liquor starred in the episodes \\"Dog Show\\" and \\"Man's Best Friend\\" and made brief cameos in the episodes \\"The Boy Who Cried Rat\\" and \\"Robin H√∂ek\\". According to Kricfalusi, Liquor only appeared in a few episodes because those in charge of Nickelodeon at the time hated the character. Ren and Stimpy animator Bill Wray described Liquor as a character that Nickelodeon \\"never liked\\" because the name \\"Liquor\\" both was a reference to alcohol and sounded like the words \\"lick her\\".\\"Bill Wray.\\" David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview No. 122. 1993. Wray said that Nickelodeon disapproved of George but did not forbid Kricfalusi from using the character. In one of Liquor's starring roles, in the episode \\"Dog Show\\", George put characters Ren and Stimpy through a painful process of making the two into perfect pets for a dog show. Before the episode was broadcast, it was censored so that George's last name, \\"Liquor\\", was cut from the soundtrack. According to Forbidden Animation: Censored Cartoons And Blacklisted Animators in America, Nickelodeon has not officially explained why the name \\"Liquor\\" was cut from broadcasting. Liquor's other major appearance, the episode \\"Man's Best Friend\\", was banned from Nickelodeon and was not shown on television for years because of its content. In the episode, George makes threats and angry demands to Ren and Stimpy, and in the end of the episode, Ren beats George with an oar. In addition to missing deadlines for Nickelodeon and making too many controversial cartoons, Kricfalusi said that the episode \\"Man's Best Friend\\" was the episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show that got him and the Spumco staff fired from the series. Kricfalusi said that \\"Man's Best Friend\\" was actually approved for broadcasting by both Standards and Practices and Nickelodeon administrators, but the Nickelodeon staff declined to broadcast the episode when network executives saw the finished product. Wray stated that the episode was \\"all finished and ready to go\\" before the cancellation. The episode aired on Spike TV in 2003 as part of Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon. When Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi, the network gave him the rights to use George Liquor because the network employees did not like the character. The arrangement with the network also granted Kricfalusi the rights to Jimmy the Hapless Idiot Boy. In Comic Book After Nickelodeon, George Liquor and Jimmy The Idiot Boy starred in Sp√ºmc√∏ Comic Book, a Sp√ºmc√∏-produced comic book series. The comic book series also had appearances of the various characters who regularly interacted with George and Jimmy. The series was launched at Marvel Comics, but Kricfalusi decided to move the series to Dark Horse Comics, as \\"Marvel wanted to maintain its corporate image, so we moved to Dark Horse, where they have no social conscience\\". The series was written and drawn by Sp√ºmc√∏ co- founders Kricfalusi and Jim Smith and other members of the original Sp√ºmc√∏ staff. While with Marvel, Comic Book was nominated for an Eisner Award for Best Humor Publication. One story in the first issue of the Dark Horse's Comic Book, George Liquor's Fishing Show, was later made into a webcomic with sound that was featured on the Sp√ºmc√∏ website. On The Goddamn George Liquor Program George Liquor being used in Macromedia Flash in a commercial for Tower Records. George Liquor starred in the Flash Internet cartoon series The Goddamn George Liquor Program, created by Kricfalusi. Premiering on October 15, 1997, The Goddamn George Liquor Program was the first cartoon series to be produced exclusively for the Internet. George appeared on the series with his nephew, Jimmy The Idiot Boy; Jimmy's cousins, Slab and Ernie; Jimmy's love interest, Sody Pop; and George and Jimmy's pet dog, Dirty Dog. Without the control of a network, the series could be made as Kricfalusi wanted. Sp√ºmc√∏ produced eight one-minute shorts. In 1999, The Goddamn George Liquor Program won an Annie Award for \\"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Interactive Production\\". The series spawned an online short called A George Liquor Christmas, also starring him, Jimmy and Pop. In advertisements After being fired from The Ren & Stimpy Show, John Kricfalusi used George Liquor in Macromedia Flash advertisements in hopes of creating a series with direct sponsorship without a network. Kricfalusi began with free advertisements that he made for Tower Records in 1997. George Liquor has been used in Kricfalusi's advertisements for Barq's Root Beer, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, and the internet communication service Raketu. Recently, George Liquor has appeared in promos airing on Adult Swim advertising upcoming UFC fights along with other characters such as Slab N' Ernie and Hank Hill. A series of cartoon commercials was developed by Kricfalusi in 2008 for Pontiac Vibe starring him, but the series remained unreleased after General Motors discontinued the Pontiac Vibe auto line in 2009. In video games George Liquor appears in The Ren & Stimpy Show: Buckaroo$! for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES as the Sheriff of Dodge City. On Cans Without Labels George Liquor has a prominent role in the Kickstarter crowdfunded short, Cans Without Labels. Originally intended for release in February 2013, production of the short was delayed up until its completion on August 6, 2017 despite technical difficulties of the DVD mastering. On May 27, 2019, John Kricfalusi announced the DVD masterings' completion and it is currently available on his MyShopify store online on DVD, with backers receiving the DVD's first shipments. Based on Kricfalusi's childhood experience, the short details George purchasing unlabeled silver cans for a cheap price, and his attempts to feed them to Slab and Ernie (voiced by Eric Bauza and Gabe Swarr). Despite believing that he would guess the can as beef stew, he opened the can to reveal that there was a face inside instead . He still insisted on feeding it to them. George gives the two by the time he finishes using the bathroom to eat the entire face. Towards the end of the short, George appears with a belt, preparing to punish them. To his surprise, George notices the empty can (as a result of the two feeding the face to surprise guest Donald Bastard, a parody of Donald Duck) and congratulates them. To celebrate, he offers to open another can but Slab and Ernie run away at the last minute. This short marked the final time Mike Pataki voiced the character (and his final voice role overall) due to his death on April 15, 2010; his voice work was completed before his death. It was dedicated to his memory.

Founded in Ia»ôi, in 1871, and reestablished in 1888, in Bucharest, it was the main left-wing press venue to be published during the Romanian Kingdom's existence, adopting an independent pro-democratic position, advocating land reform, and demanding universal suffrage. Under its successive editors Alexandru Beldiman and Constantin Mille, it became noted for its virulent criticism of King Carol I. This stance developed into a republican and socialist agenda, which made AdevƒÉrul clash with the Kingdom's authorities on several occasions. As innovative publications which set up several local and international records during the early 20th century, AdevƒÉrul and its sister daily Diminea»õa competed for the top position with the right-wing Universul before and throughout the interwar period. In 1920, AdevƒÉrul also began publishing its prestigious cultural supplement, AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic. By the 1930s, their anti-fascism and the Jewish ethnicity of their new owners made AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa the targets of negative campaigns in the far right press, and the antisemitic Octavian Goga cabinet banned both upon obtaining power in 1937. AdevƒÉrul was revived by Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu after World War II, but was targeted by Communist Romania's censorship apparatus and again closed down in 1951. A newspaper of the same name was set up in 1989, just days after the Romanian Revolution, replacing Sc√Ænteia, organ of the defunct Romanian Communist Party. Initially a supporter of the dominant National Salvation Front, it adopted a controversial position, being much criticized for producing populist and radical nationalist messages and for supporting the violent Mineriad of 1990. Under editors Dumitru Tinu and Cristian Tudor Popescu, when it reasserted its independence as a socially conservative venue and was fully privatized, AdevƒÉrul became one of the most popular and trusted press venues. Nevertheless, it remained involved in scandals over alleged or confirmed political and commercial dealings, culminating in a 2005 conflict which saw the departure of Popescu, Bogdan Chireac and other panelists and the creation of rival newspaper G√¢ndul. As of 2006, AdevƒÉrul had been the property of Dinu Patriciu, a prominent Romanian businessman and politician. In the recent years, AdevƒÉrul dropped its conservative views in favour of a socially progressive position. In 2018, the newspaper referred to the turnout of 2018 Romanian constitutional referendum as \\"presence of hatred\\". Ownership, editorial team and structure AdevƒÉrul is the main trademark of AdevƒÉrul Holding, a company owned by Cristian Burci. The main newspaper itself is edited by editor-in-chief Dan Marinescu and several deputy editors (Liviu Avram, Adina Stan, Andrei Velea and others). Also part of the holding are the cultural magazines Dilema Veche and ', the tabloid Click!, the magazines Click! pentru femei, Click! SƒÉnƒÉtate, Click! PoftƒÉ bunƒÉ! and OK! Magazine. In December 2010, AdevƒÉrul Holding also launched a sister version of its title asset, published in neighboring Moldova as AdevƒÉrul Moldova. \\"AdevƒÉrul Moldova a pornit cu toate p√¢nzele sus\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 7, 2010; \\"Pe scurt: AdevƒÉrul Holding lanseazƒÉ AdevƒÉrul Moldova ≈üi contracteazƒÉ un credit de 42 de milioane lei. Ioana Lupea ≈üi Mircea Marian √Æn locul lui Radu Moraru\\", at Hotnews.ro, December 3, 2010; retrieved December 27, 2010 The Romanian newspaper had special pages of regional content, one each for Bucharest, Transylvania, Moldavia, the western areas of Banat and Cri»ôana, and the southern areas of Wallachia and Northern Dobruja. It also hosts columns about the larger sections of Romanian diaspora in Europe, those in Spain and Italy. AdevƒÉrul publishes several supplements. In addition to AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic (formerly a separate magazine, now issued as a culture supplement which is issued on Wednesdays), it publishes five others: on Mondays, the sports magazine Antifotbal (\\"Anti-football\\"), which focuses on the traditionally less-covered areas of the Romanian sports scene; on Tuesdays, AdevƒÉrul Expert Imobiliar (\\"Real Estate Expert\\"); on Thursdays, AdevƒÉrul SƒÉnƒÉtate (\\"Health\\"), a health and lifestyle magazine; on Fridays, a TV guide, AdevƒÉrul Ghid TV, followed on Sundays by the entertainment section Magazin de DuminicƒÉ (\\"Sunday Magazine\\"). In October 2008, AdevƒÉrul also launched AdevƒÉrul de SearƒÉ (\\"Evening AdevƒÉrul\\"), a free daily newspaper and evening edition, which was closed down in May 2011. \\"Noapte bunƒÉ, AdevƒÉrul de searƒÉ! Trustul are datorii\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, May 11, 2011 As of 2008, the newspaper publishes Colec»õia AdevƒÉrul, a collection of classic and popular works in world and Romanian literature. These are issued as additional supplements, and sold as such with the newspaper's Thursday editions. History1871 and 1888 editions=Origins The Adeverulu published in Ia»ôi (front page of the first issue in the 1871 series). First version of the Adevƒïrul logo (front page of the first issue in the 1888 series). A similar version was used in the early 1990s (AdevƒÉrul, in light blue, with identical typeface). A newspaper by the name Adevƒïrul≈≠ (pronounced the same as AdevƒÉrul, but following versions of the Romanian alphabet which emphasized etymology, in this case from the Latin word veritas) was founded on December 15, 1871. Florentina Tone, \\"Povestea fondatorului ziarului Adevƒïrul\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 16, 2008 The weekly was owned by Alexandru Beldiman, a former Police commander, and published in Ia»ôi, the former capital of Moldavia. Beldiman directed the newspaper in opposition to Romania's new Domnitor, the German prince Carol of Hohenzollern, calling for the restoration of his deposed and exiled predecessor, the Moldavian-born Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Its articles against the new monarch soon after resulted in Beldiman's indictment for defamation and attack on the 1866 Constitution. He was eventually acquitted, but the journal ceased publication with its 13th issue (April 1872). AdevƒÉrul reemerged as a daily on August 15, 1888, seven years after the proclamation of a Romanian Kingdom. It was then known as Adevƒïrul, which also reflected the veritas origin, and the ƒï, although obsolete by the early 20th century, was kept as a distinctive sign by all the paper's owners until 1951. Florentina Tone, \\"PƒÉrintele ziaristicii rom√¢ne moderne\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 21, 2008 Initially financed by a printer, who agreed to advance it a short-term credit, Florentina Tone, \\"Adevƒïrul, ziarul premierelor\\", in AdevƒÉrul, December 23, 2008 the new gazette was co-founded by Alexandru Beldiman and Alexandru Al. Ioan, the son of former Domnitor Cuza, and was again noted for its radical and often irreverent critique of newly crowned King Carol and the \\"foreign dynasty\\". Florentina Tone, \\"Adevƒïrul la Bucure≈üti\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 17, 2008 Florentina Tone, \\"Campaniile Adevƒïrului\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 18, 2008 The small editorial team included writer Grigore Ventura and his son Constantin, as well as, after a while, political columnist I. Hussar. In December 1888, it changed its format, from a No. 6 to a No. 10 in paper size, while abandoning the initial, calligraphed logo, in favor of a standard serif which it used until 1951. Beldiman's hostility to the monarchy was reflected in one of the 15 objectives set by the second series' first issue, whereby AdevƒÉrul called for an elective monarchy with magistratures reserved for locals, and evident in having chosen for the paper's motto a quote from poet Vasile Alecsandri, which read: SƒÉ te feresci, Rom√¢ne!, de cui≈≠ strein √Æn casƒÉ (\\"Romanians, beware of foreign nails in your house\\", an allusion to Carol's German origin).P√¢rvulescu, p.115 The journalists called Carol's accession to the throne by the 1866 plebiscite \\"an undignified comedy\\", refused to capitalize references to M. S. Regele (\\"H[is] M[ajesty] the King\\"), and referred to May 10, the national celebration of the Kingdom, as a \\"national day of mourning\\". Florentina Tone, \\"Adevƒïrul deranjeazƒÉ\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 19, 2008 In December 1888, they also published a list of Carol's alleged attacks on Romanian dignity.P√¢rvulescu, p.115-116 According to one account, after the newspaper's first May 10 issue came out in 1889, Police forces bought copies which they later set on fire. Reportedly, its circulation peaked on May 10 of each year, from some 5,000 to some 25,000 or 30,000 copies. Florentina Tone, \\"Recordurile Adevƒïrului\\", in AdevƒÉrul, December 24, 2008 AdevƒÉrul also debated with the German newspapers Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung and K√∂lnische Zeitung, who worried that Romania's anti-dynasticists plotted Carol's murder, assuring them that the actual battle was political, \\"in broad daylight, on the wide path of public opinion.\\" In 1891, the paper called for boycotting Carol's 25th anniversary on the throne. Early campaigns Located in Bucharest, the new AdevƒÉrul had its original headquarters in Calea Victoriei (Doamnei Street, NouƒÉ Street, BrƒÉtianu Boulevard and Enei Street). Florentina Tone, \\"Palatul de pe SƒÉrindar, mƒÉrire ≈üi decƒÉdere\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 27, 2008 It later moved to a building near the National Bank and the Vilacrosse Passage, where it occupied just several rooms (leading its staff to repeatedly complain about the lack of space). Florentina Tone, \\"Pove≈üti din via≈£a Adevƒïrului\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 31, 2008 A serious crisis occurred during 1892, when, having omitted to register his trademark, Beldiman was confronted with the appearance of a competing AdevƒÉrul, published by his former associate Toma Basilescu, who had been the original gazette's administrator for the previous year. In June 1892, an arbitral tribunal decided in favor of Beldiman, ordering Basilescu to close down his paper. With time, the newspaper had moved from advocating King Carol's replacement with a local ruler to supporting republicanism. In 1893, as part of its extended campaign, during which it gathered letters of protest from its readers, AdevƒÉrul obtained the cancellation of plans for a public subscription to celebrate the engagement of Crown Prince Ferdinand to Marie of Edinburgh. In addition, AdevƒÉrul began militating for a number of major social and political causes, which it perceived as essential to democracy. In its 15 points of 1888, it notably demanded universal suffrage to replace the census method enshrined in the 1866 Constitution, unicameralism through a disestablishment of the Senate, a land reform to replace leasehold estates, self-governance at a local level, progressive taxation, Sunday rest for employees, universal conscription instead of a permanent under arms force, women's rights, emancipation for Romanian Jews. It embraced the cause of Romanians living outside the Old Kingdom, particularly those in Austro‚ÄìHungarian-ruled Transylvania, while calling for Romania to separate itself from its commitment to the Triple Alliance, and advocating a Balkan Federation to include Romania. AdevƒÉrul also took an active interest in the problems facing Romania's rural population: while calling for a land reform, it expressed condemnation of the failing sanitary system, which it blamed for the frequency of countryside epidemics, and for the administrative system, which it accused of corruption. It depicted revolt as legitimate, and campaigned in favor of amnesty for prisoners taken after the 1888 peasant riots. The paper supported educational reforms in the countryside, calling attention to the specific issues faced by rural teachers, but also campaigned against their use of corporal punishment as a method of maintaining school discipline. In similar vein, AdevƒÉrul focused on cases of abuse within the Romanian Army, documenting cases where soldiers were being illegally used as indentured servants, noting the unsanitary conditions which accounted for an unusually high rate of severe conjunctivitis, and condemning officers for regularly beating their subordinates. As part of the latter campaign, it focused on Crown Prince Ferdinand, who was tasked with instructing a battalion and is said to have slapped a soldier for not performing the proper moves. AdevƒÉrul investigated numerous other excesses of authority, and on several occasions formed special investigative commissions of reporters who followed suspicions of judicial error. It also spoke out in favor of Jewish emancipation, while theorizing a difference between the minority \\"exploiting Jews\\" and an assimilable Jewish majority. Under Beldiman, the newspaper took pride in stating its independence, by taking distance from the two dominant parties, the Conservatives and the National Liberal Party, who either supported or tolerated King Carol. This stance reputedly earned the publication an unusual status: anecdotes have it that Conservative leader LascƒÉr Catargiu would only read AdevƒÉrul while in the opposition, and that its columnist Albert Honigman was the first and for long time only journalist allowed into the upper-class society at Casa Cap»ôa restaurant. In February 1889, the Conservative Premier Theodor Rosetti reputedly tried to silence AdevƒÉrul by having its distributors arrested. In 1892, AdevƒÉrul became the first local newspaper to feature a cartoonist section, which hosted caricatures of the period's potentates, and its rebelliousness allegedly frightened the Romanian zincographers to the point where the plates had to be created abroad. In April 1893, the Catargiu cabinet organized a clampdown on the newspaper: it arrested its editor Eduard Dioghenide (who was sentenced to a year in prison on charges of sedition) and, profiting from the non- emancipated status of Romanian Jews, it expelled its Jewish contributors I. Hussar and Carol Schulder. Another incident occurred during May of the following year, when the paper's headquarters were attacked by rioting University of Bucharest students, who were reportedly outraged by an article critical of their behavior, but also believed to have been instigated by the Conservative executive's Gendarmerie. In parallel, AdevƒÉrul took steps to establishing its reputation as a newspaper of record. A local first was established in June 1894, when AdevƒÉrul hosted the first foreign correspondence article received by a Romanian periodical: a telegram sent by the French socialist newspaperman Victor Jaclard, discussing the assassination of Marie Fran√ßois Sadi Carnot and the accession of Jean Casimir-Perier to the office of President. AdevƒÉrul also broke ground by publishing a plate portrait of Casimir-Perier only a day after his rise to prominence. Early on, the newspaper also had a cultural agenda, striving to promote Romanian literature for the general public and following a method outlined by a 1913 article: \\"In his free time [...], the reader, having satisfied his curiosity about the daily events, finds entertainment for the soul in the newspaper's literary column. People who would not spend a dime on literary works, will nevertheless read literature once this is made available to them, in a newspaper they bought for the information it provides.\\" Florentina Tone, \\"Scriitorii de la Adevƒïrul\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 30, 2008 Initially, AdevƒÉrul dedicated its Sunday issue to literary contributions, receiving such pieces from George Co»ôbuc, Haralamb Lecca, Ioan N. Roman, and the adolescent poet »ôtefan Octavian Iosif. Mille's arrival and rise in popularity AdevƒÉrul editors in 1897. Constantin Mille is first seated from left. Standing behind him are Ioan Bacalba»ôa (middle) and Constantin Bacalba»ôa (right) By 1893, the gazette's panel came to include several leading activists of the newly created Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR), among them Constantin Mille and brothers Anton and Ioan Bacalba»ôa. Mille was an innovator, seen by his contemporaries as a \\"father of modern Romanian journalism\\" (a title carved on his tombstone in Bellu cemetery). Although brief, Anton Bacalba»ôa's stay also left a distinct mark on AdevƒÉrul: in 1893, he authored what is supposedly the first interview in Romanian media history. Ion Simu≈£, \\"Caragiale √Æn tradi≈£ia interviului\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 9/2005 Working together, Mille, Beldiman and Bacalba»ôa sought to coalesce the left-wing forces into a single league for universal suffrage, but AdevƒÉrul soon pulled out of the effort, accusing fellow militant Constantin Dobrescu-Arge»ô of having embezzled the funds put at his disposal.Vasile Niculae, \\"Liga votului universal\\", in Magazin Istoric, August 1973, p.72-73 In 1895, Mille purchased the newspaper, but, even though the Alecsandri motto was removed a short while after, Beldiman maintained editorial control until his death three years later, explaining that he was doing so in order to maintain an independent line. The purchase was received with consternation by many PSDMR members, particularly since AdevƒÉrul competed with its official platforms (Munca and, after 1894, Lumea NouƒÉ). 110 ani de social-democra≈£ie √Æn Rom√¢nia , Social Democratic Party & Ovidiu ≈ûincai Social Democratic Institute release, Bucharest, July 9, 2003, p.12; retrieved April 18, 2009 In late 1893, AdevƒÉrul was also publishing articles by an unsigned author, who may have been Constantin Stere (later known as the man behind post-socialist \\"Poporanism\\") ridiculing Muncas elitist content. Victor Durnea, \\"√énceputurile publicistice ale lui Constantin Stere\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 45/2007 Eventually, the PSDMR expelled Mille on grounds of having betrayed socialism. Allegedly upset that Beldiman had chosen Mille's offer over his own, Anton Bacalba»ôa quit AdevƒÉrul, becoming one of Mille's most vocal critics. A third Bacalba»ôa, Constantin, stayed on, and, from 1895, was Mille's first editor. Z.

A., the first in a series of joint stock companies meant to insure its control of commercial rights. Florentina Tone, \\"Istorie zbuciumatƒÉ √Æn anii interbelici\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 28, 2008 In 1898, after Mille invested its profits into real estate, AdevƒÉrul left its crowded surroundings and moved to a specially designed new building on SƒÉrindar Street (the present-day C. Mille Street, between Calea Victoriei and the Ci»ômigiu Gardens). Inspired by Le Figaros palatial quarters, it was first building of such proportions in the history of Romania's print media, housing a printing press, paper storage, distribution office and mail room, as well as a library, several archives, a phone station and a Romanian Orthodox chapel. Its halls were luxuriously decorated according to Mille's specifications, and adorned with posters by international artists such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Alfons Mucha, and by its own occasional illustrator, Nicolae Vermont. Around 1900, Mille purchased a neighboring plot, the former Saint-Fr√®res manufacturing plant, and unified both buildings under a single facade. It was there that, after placing an order with the Mergenthaler Company, he installed the first Linotype machines to be used locally. AdevƒÉrul established itself as the most circulated paper, setting up successive records in terms of copies per issue due to Mille's favorable approach to modern printing techniques: from 10,000 in 1894, these brought the circulation to 12,000 in 1895 and 30,000 in 1907. Writing in 1898, Mille took pride in calling his newspaper \\"a daily encyclopedia\\" or \\"cinema\\" for the regular public, universally available at only 5 bani per copy. CƒÉtƒÉlin Mihuleac, \\" '1907' ≈üi '1989' ‚Äì douƒÉ mari manipulƒÉri prin presƒÉ\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, April 2007 In 1904, making efforts to keep up with his rival Luigi Cazzavillan, founder of the right-wing competitor Universul, Mille established a morning edition, which was emancipated under separate management in December of the same year, under the new name Diminea»õa. As of 1912, Diminea»õa was the first Romanian daily to use full color print, with a claim to have been the world's first color newspaper. Beginning 1905, both gazettes ensured stable revenues by leasing their classified advertising sections to Carol Schulder's Schulder Agency. Early cultural ventures In order to consecrate the newspaper's cultural ambitions, Mille became head of a literary club, while he considered creating a separate literary edition. A literary supplement (Adevƒïrul Literar, \\"The Literary Truth\\") was in print between 1894 and 1896, before being replaced by Adevƒïrul Ilustrat (\\"The Illustrated Truth\\") and soon after by Adevƒïrul de Joi (\\"The Truth on Thursday\\"), edited by poet Artur Stavri, and eventually closed down due to lack of funding in 1897. Although short-lived, these publications had a significant part on the cultural scene, and hosted contributions by influential, mostly left-wing, cultural figures: Stavri, Stere, Constantin D. Anghel, Traian Demetrescu, Arthur Gorovei, Ion Gorun, Henric and Simion Sanielevici. In this context, AdevƒÉrul also began receiving contributions from prominent humorist Ion Luca Caragiale‚Äîpreviously a conservative adversary, known for his mockery of republican sensationalism.P√¢rvulescu, p.116 In return for the 1897 setback, the gazette began allocating space to serialized works of literature, including sketches by Caragiale (most of the writings later published as Momente »ôi schi»õe), as well as The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. In later years, AdevƒÉrul experimented by publishing a different supplement each day, including one titled Litere »ôi Arte (\\"Arts and Letters\\"). By the mid-1890s, AdevƒÉrul was encouraging developments in visual arts in Romania, publishing several original posters, and hosting art chronicles signed with various pseudonyms. In 1895, it covered the artistic environment's split into several competing wings: its columnist, using the pseudonym Index, gave a negative review to Nicolae Grigorescu and the other Impressionists or Realists who together had rebelled against the official academic salon of C. I. StƒÉncescu.Ionescu, p.215-216 The following year however, a chronicler who used the pen name Gal praised the anti-academic independents' salon, supporting its members »ôtefan Luchian, Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti and Vermont (whose portraits it featured as illustrations for the texts, alongside a notorious caricature of C. I. StƒÉncescu by Nicolae Petrescu-GƒÉinƒÉ).Ionescu, p.229-234 By 1905, AdevƒÉrul was publishing a supplement titled Via»õa LiterarƒÉ (\\"The Literary Life\\", edited by Co»ôbuc, Gorun and Ilarie Chendi) and two other satirical periodicals, Belgia Orientului (\\"The Orient's Belgium\\", named after a common sarcastic reference to the Romanian Kingdom) and Nea Ghi»õƒÉ (\\"Uncle Ghi»õƒÉ\\"). It also began running its own publishing house, Editura Adevƒïrul, noted early on for its editions of Constantin Mille's novels, Caragiale's sketches, and George Panu's memoirs of his time with the literary club Junimea. In parallel, Mille reached out into other areas of local culture. Early on, he instituted a tradition of monthly festivities, paid for from his own pocket, and noted for the participation of leading figures in Romanian theater (Maria Giurgea, Constantin Nottara and Aristizza Romanescu among them). Beginning 1905, the paper had for its illustrator Iosif Iser, one of the major graphic artists of his generation, whose satirical drawings most often targeted Carol I and Russian Emperor Nicholas II (attacked for violently suppressing the 1905 Revolution).Sandqvist, p.70, 72 As a promotional tactic, AdevƒÉrul participated in the National Fair of 1906, where it exemplified its printing techniques while putting out a collector's version of the newspaper, titled Adevƒïrul la Expozi»õie (\\"Adevƒïrul at the Exhibit\\"). New advocacies and 1907 Revolt coverage Several mass social, cultural and political campaigns were initiated or endorsed by AdevƒÉrul before 1910. According to one of Constantin Mille's columns of 1906, the newspaper continued to see itself as an advocate of people's causes: \\"Any of our readers know that, should any injustice be committed against them, should all authorities discard them, they will still find shelter under this newspaper's roof.\\" In line with Beldiman and Mille's political vision, it militated for a statue of Domnitor Cuza to be erected in Ia»ôi (such a monument being eventually inaugurated in 1912). Similar initiatives included the 1904 event marking 400 years since the death of Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, and the erection in Craiova of a bust honoring its deceased contributor, poet Traian Demetrescu. At around the same time, Mille's gazette became a noted supporter of feminism, and created a special column, Cronica femeii (\\"The Woman's Chronicle\\"), assigned to female journalist Ecaterina Raicoviceanu-Fulmen. Marian Petcu, \\"Jurnaliste ≈üi publiciste uitate\\" , in the University of Bucharest Faculty of Journalism's Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ de Jurnalism ≈üi Comunicare , Nr. 2-3/2006 Over the following decade, it hosted regular contributions by other militant women, among them Lucrezzia Karnabatt, E. Marghita, Maura Prigor, Laura Vampa and Aida Vrioni. Having endorsed the creation of a journalists' trade union and a Romanian Writers' Society, the newspaper also claimed to have inspired the idea of a Bucharest ambulance service, a project taken up by physician Nicolae Minovici and fulfilled in 1906. Despite his leftist sympathies, Mille found himself in conflict with Romania's labor movement: believing that the Linotype machines would render their jobs obsolete, they went on strike, before the editor himself resolved to educate them all in the new techniques. AdevƒÉruls ongoing support for Jewish emancipation was accompanied by a sympathetic take on the growing Zionist movement. In 1902, the paper offered an enthusiastic reception to visiting French Zionist Bernard Lazare, prompting negative comments from the antisemitic French observers.David Pryce-Jones, Betrayal: France, the Arabs, and the Jews, Encounter Books, New York City, 2008, p.28. By 1906, AdevƒÉruls attitude prompted historian Nicolae Iorga, leader of the antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party, to accuse the newspaper of cultivating a \\"Jewish national sentiment\\" which, he claimed, had for its actual goal the destruction of Romania.Final Report, p.27 In his Na»õionalism sau democra»õie (\\"Nationalism or Democracy\\") series of articles for SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul magazine (an ethno- nationalist organ published by Iorga), the Transylvanian-based thinker Aurel Popovici, who criticized the elites of Austria‚ÄìHungary on grounds that they were serving Jewish interests, alleged that the impact of AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa carried the same risk for Romania.Voicu, p.146 In later years, Iorga casually referred to AdevƒÉrul as \\"the Jewish press organ\\", while, together with his political associate A. C. Cuza and other contributors to his Neamul Rom√¢nesc journal, he repeatedly claimed that the entire press was controlled by the Jews.Voicu, p.146-147 The antisemitic discourse targeting the SƒÉrindar- based publications was taken up in the same period by the traditionalist Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga and by businessman-journalist Stelian Popescu (who, in 1915, became owner of Universul).Voicu, p.147-148 Pursuing its interest in the peasant question, AdevƒÉrul was one of the main factors of dissent during the 1907 Peasant Revolt, which was violently quelled by the National Liberal cabinet of Dimitrie Sturdza. The paper reported on or made allegations about the shooting and maltreatment of peasants, reputedly to the point where government officials promised to end repression if Mille agreed to tone down his publication. Various researchers accuse Mille of having seriously exaggerated the scale of repression for political purposes. Ion Bulei, \\"421, nu 11.000\\", in Ziarul Financiar, February 2, 2007 Anton Caragea, \\"RƒÉscoalƒÉ sau complot?\\", in Magazin Istoric, January 2003Stelian TƒÉnase, \\"N.D. Cocea, un boier amoral/N.D. Cocea, an Immoral Boyar\\" (I), in Sfera Politicii, Nr. 136 Historian Anton Caragea, who theorizes the intrusion of Austria‚ÄìHungary, argues that, having received payments from Austro‚ÄìHungarian spies, both AdevƒÉrul and Universul were conditioned to incite public sentiment against the Sturdza executive. Soon after the revolt, Editura Adevƒïrul published Caragiale's 1907, din primƒÉvarƒÉ p√¢nƒÉ √Æn toamnƒÉ (\\"1907, From Spring to Autumn\\"), an attack on the Kingdom's institutions and analysis of its failures in connection to the rebellion, which was an instant best- seller.≈ûerban Cioculescu, Caragialiana, Editura Eminescu, Bucharest, 1974, p.28-29. Early 1910s Following the 1907 events, the gazette participated in an extended anti-monarchy campaign, which also involved Facla, a newspaper edited by Mille's son-in-law, the republican and socialist journalist N. D. Cocea, as well as Romanian anarchist milieus. G. Pienescu, \\"Un proces care nu a avut loc dec√¢t pe h√¢rtie\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 24/2006 In 1912, it participated in one of Cocea's publicity stunts, during which the Facla editor, together with his colleague, poet Tudor Arghezi, simulated their own trial for l√®se majest√©, by reporting the mock procedures and hosting advertisements for Facla. Like Facla itself, AdevƒÉrul circulated stereotypical satires of Carol I, constantly referring to him as neam»õul (\\"the German\\" in colloquial terms) or cƒÉpu»ôa (\\"the tick\\"). In 1912, the combined circulation of AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa exceeded 100,000 copies, bringing it a revenue of 1 million lei; the two periodicals assessed that, between January and August 1914, they had printed some 1,284 tons of paper.Boia, p.95 AdevƒÉrul had become the highest-grossing, but also the highest-paying press venue, and consequently the most sought-after employer: in 1913, it had a writing and technical staff of 250 people (whose salaries amounted to some 540,000 lei), in addition to whom it employed 60 correspondents and 1,800 official distributors. AdevƒÉrul reportedly had a notoriously stiff editorial policy, outlined by Mille and applied by his administrative editor Sache Petreanu, whereby it taxed the proofreaders for each typo. Mille himself repeatedly urged his employees to keep up with the events, decking the walls with portraits of 19th-century newspaperman Zaharia Carcalechi, infamous for his professional lassitude. In addition to establishing permanent telephone links within Austria‚ÄìHungary (in both Vienna and Budapest), AdevƒÉrul maintained a regular correspondence with various Balkan capitals, and pioneered shorthand in transcribing interviews. Among its indigenous journalists to be sent on special assignment abroad were Emil Fagure and Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu, who reported on the 1908 Young Turk Revolution from inside the Ottoman Empire, as well as from the Principality of Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Serbia. The newspaper was nevertheless subject to a practical joke played by its correspondent, future writer Victor Eftimiu: instead of continuing his AdevƒÉrul-sponsored trip to France, Eftimiu stopped in Vienna, and compiled his \\"Letters from Paris\\" column from the press articles he read at Caf√© Arkaden.Hartmut Gagelmann, Nicolae Bretan, His Life, His Music, Pendragon Press, Hillsdale, 2000, p.20, 73. AdevƒÉruls coverage of the international scene gave Romanians a window to political and cultural turmoil. By 1908, AdevƒÉrul was covering the burgeoning European avant-garde, offering mixed reviews to Futurism and deploring the supposed end of literary realism.Sandqvist, p.242 In late 1910, claiming to speak for \\"the democratic world\\", it celebrated the Portuguese republican revolt.Ion Babici, \\"Octombrie 1910. Portugalia se proclamƒÉ republicƒÉ\\", in Magazin Istoric, October 1975, p.39-40 The efforts made for establishing and preserving international connections, AdevƒÉrul claimed, made it one of the first papers in the world to report some other events of continental importance: the 1911 food riots in Vienna, the outbreak of the First Balkan War, and the diplomatic conflict between the Greek and Bulgarian Kingdoms in the run-up to the Second Balkan War. During the latter showdowns, AdevƒÉrul also employed several literary and political personalities as its correspondents: the paper's future manager Iacob Rosenthal in Sofia, Serbian journalist Pera Taletov in Belgrade, Romanian writer Argentina Monteoru in Istanbul, and Prince Albert Gjika in Cetinje. In July 1913, the newspaper reported extensively on massacres committed by the Hellenic Army in Dojran, Kilkis and other settlements of Macedonia, while discussing the \\"terror regime\\" instituted in Bulgaria by Tsar Ferdinand I. Adrian Majuru, \\"Despre un rƒÉzboi mai pu≈£in cunoscut (I)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, May 9, 2008 Later the same month, as Romania joined the anti-Bulgarian coalition and her troops entered Southern Dobruja, AdevƒÉrul gave coverage to the spread of cholera among soldiers, accusing the Conservative executive headed by Titu Maiorescu of hiding its actual toll. Adrian Majuru, \\"Despre un rƒÉzboi mai pu≈£in cunoscut (II)\\", in Ziarul Financiar, May 16, 2008 Also at that stage, the newspaper had become known for organizing raffles, which provided winners with expensive prizes, such as real estate and furniture. It was also the first periodical to have established itself in the countryside, a record secured through a special contract with the Romanian Post, whereby postmen acted as press distributors, allowing some 300 press storage rooms to be established nationally. Political differences of the period, pitting AdevƒÉrul editors against National Liberal politicos, threatened this monopoly: under National Liberal cabinets, the Post was prevented from distributing the newspaper, leading it to rely on subscriptions and private distributors. Famous among the latter were Bucharest paperboys, who advertised AdevƒÉrul with political songs such as the republican anthem La Marseillaise. World War I Bucharest demonstration in favor of Romania's entry into World War I (1915 or 1916). After the outbreak of World War I, the newspaper further divided the surviving socialist camp by swinging into the interventionist group, calling for a declaration of war against the Central Powers.Boia, p.90-91, 93, 95, 107, 114, 198, 210, 272; Torrey, p.5, 18-19, 24-27 This position was more compatible with that of newspapers like Universul, FlacƒÉra, Furnica or Epoca, clashing with the socialist press, the Poporanists, and Germanophile gazettes such as Seara, Steagul, Minerva or Opinia.Boia, p.93-100, 333-337 According to historian Lucian Boia, this stance was partly explained by the Jewish origin of its panelists, who, as advocates of assimilation, wanted to identify with the Romanian cultural nationalism and irredenta; an exception was the Germanophile BrƒÉni»ôteanu, for a while marginalized within the group.Boia, p.90-91, 96, 200-201 AdevƒÉrul agitated with energy against Austria‚ÄìHungary on the Transylvanian issue, while giving less exposure to the problems of Romanians in Russian-held Bessarabia. This was a programmatic choice, outlined by Transylvanian academic Ioan Ursu in a September 1914 article for AdevƒÉrul, where Russophobia was condemned as a canard.Boia, p.198 Over the course of 1914, the aging historian A. D. Xenopol also made AdevƒÉrul the host of his interventionist essays, later collected as a volume.Boia, p.107 In early winter 1915, AdevƒÉrul publicized the visit of British scholar Robert William Seton-Watson, who campaigned in favor of the Entente Powers and supported the interventionist Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians. In his interview with AdevƒÉrul, Seton-Watson identified the goals of Romanians with those of Serbs and Croats, stressing that their common interest called for the partition of Austria‚ÄìHungary, ending what he called \\"the brutal and artificial domination of the Magyar race\\".Hugh Seton-Watson, Christopher Seton-Watson, The Making of a New Europe. R. W. Seton-Watson and the Last Years of Austria‚ÄìHungary, Methuen Publishing, London, 1981, p.114-115. One of the newspaper's own articles, published in April 1916, focused on the ethnic German Transylvanian Saxons and their relationship with Romanians in Austria‚ÄìHungary, claiming: \\"Except for the Hungarians, we had throughout our history, just as we have today, an enemy just as irreducible and who would desire our disappearance just as much: the Saxon people.\\"Dumitru H√Æncu, \\"The German in Romanian Mentality\\" , in the Romanian Cultural Institute's Plural Magazine , Nr. 27/2006 According to literary historian Dumitru H√Æncu, such discourse was replicated by other pro-Entente venues, marking a temporary break with a local tradition of more positive ethnic stereotypes regarding the Germans. The interventionist campaign peaked in summer 1916, when it became apparent that Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu's National Liberal cabinet was pondering Romania's entry into the conflict on the Entente side (see Romania during World War I). Mille himself explained the war as a \\"corrective\\" answer to Romania's social problems and a \\"diversion\\" for the rebellion-minded peasants.Torrey, p.5 The newspaper, described by American scholar Glenn E. Torrey as \\"sensationalist\\", provided enthusiastic accounts of the Russians' Brusilov Offensive, which had stabilized the Eastern Front in Romania's proximity, announcing that the \\"supreme moment\\" for Romania's intervention had arrived.Torrey, p.18-19 This attitude resulted in a clash between AdevƒÉrul on one side and Romania's new dominant socialist faction, the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR) and the socialist-controlled labor movement on the other. The newspaper reported the official government position on the bloody confrontations between workers and Romanian Army troops in the city of Gala»õi.Torrey, p.24 Using a style Torrey describes as \\"inflammatory\\", AdevƒÉrul also attacked PSDR leader Christian Rakovsky, co-founder of the anti- interventionist and internationalist Zimmerwald Movement, accusing him of being an \\"adventurer\\" and hireling of the German Empire.Torrey, p.25 In a 1915 letter to Zimmerwald promoter Leon Trotsky, Rakovsky himself claimed that Mille had been corrupted by Take Ionescu, leader of the pro-Entente Conservative-Democratic Party, and that his newspapers issued propaganda \\"under the mask of independence\\". Christian Rakovsky, Les socialistes et la guerre, at the Marxists Internet Archive; retrieved April 18, 2009 Romania eventually signed the 1916 Treaty of Bucharest, committing herself to the Entente cause. Its intervention in the war was nevertheless ill-fated, and resulted in the occupation of Bucharest and much of the surrounding regions by the Central Powers, with the Romanian authorities taking refuge in Ia»ôi. While Mille himself fled to Ia»ôi and later Paris, his newspapers were banned by the German authorities and the SƒÉrindar headquarters became home to the German- language official mouthpiece, Bukarester Tageblatt. BrƒÉni»ôteanu, who did not join in the exodus, worked with Constantin Stere on the Germanophile paper Lumina.Boia, p.200-201, 316 In early 1919, as the Germans lost the war, Mille returned and both AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa were again in print. In later years, AdevƒÉruls Constantin Costa-Foru covered in detail and with noted clemency the trials of various \\"collaborationist\\" journalists, including some of its former and future contributors (Stere, Tudor Arghezi, Saniel Grossman).Boia, p.339, 342-344 The newspaper was by then also reporting about Seton-Watson's disappointment with post-war Greater Romania and the centralist agenda of its founders.

The subtitle reads: \\"Evening political newspaper. Appears each day at 3 PM\\" Once reestablished, AdevƒÉrul became a dominant newspaper of the interwar period and preserved its formative role for popular culture, being joined in its leftist niche some other widely circulated periodicals (Cuv√¢ntul Liber, Rampa etc.).Cernat, p.135 More serious competition came from its old rival Universul, which now surpassed it in popularity at a national level.Bucur, p.263 By 1934, AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa still boasted a combined daily circulation of 150,000 copies.Alexandru Gruian, \\"Brunea-Fox: Saltul la realitate\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 418: Dosar: Starea reportajului, February 2012 In 1920, Mille retired from the position of editor-in-chief and moved on to create Lupta journal, amidst allegations that he had been pressured out by rival business interests. AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa were both purchased by Aristide Blank, a Romanian Jewish entrepreneur, National Liberal politician and owner of Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ company. He sold the controlling stock to other prominent Jewish businessmen, Emil and Simion Pauker, reactivating the Adevƒïrul S. A. holding in the process. Mille himself was replaced by Constantin Graur, who held managerial positions until 1936. Florentina Tone, \\"Adevƒïrul, interzis de comuni≈üti\\" , in AdevƒÉrul, December 29, 2008 Simion and Emil Pauker were, respectively, the father and uncle of Marcel Pauker, later a maverick figure in the outlawed Romanian Communist Party (PCR).TismƒÉneanu, p.300 The Paukers' ethnicity made their two newspapers preferred targets of attacks by the local antisemitic groups.Ornea (1995), p.245, 392, 402, 459-465; Veiga, p.94 In that decade, AdevƒÉrul was generally sympathetic to the National Peasants' Party, the main political force opposing the National Liberal establishment.Clark, p.305-306 The paper employed a new generation of panelists, most of whom were known for their advocacy of left-wing causes. In addition to professional journalists BrƒÉni»ôteanu, Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Tudor Teodorescu-Brani»ôte, they included respected novelist Mihail Sadoveanu and debuting essayist Petre Pandrea, as well as the best-selling fiction author Cezar Petrescu, who was briefly a member of the editorial staff.Mihai Gafi≈£a, \\"Tabel cronologic\\", in Cezar Petrescu, √éntunecare, Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, 1966, p.XXXII. Other writers with socialist or pacifist sympathies also became collaborators of AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa, most notably: Elena Farago, Eugen Relgis, Ion Marin Sadoveanu and George Mihail Zamfirescu. Mircea Popa, \\"George Mihail Zamfirescu\\", in the December 1 University of Alba Iulia's Philologica Yearbook, 2006, I, p.30 Especially noted among the young generation of leftists was F. Brunea-Fox. After a stint as political editorialist with AdevƒÉrul, he became the Romanian \\"prince of reporters\\", with investigative journalism pieces which were mainly hosted by Diminea»õa. Despite the effects of the Great Depression, the new management purchased another building in SƒÉrindar area, tearing it down and replacing it with another palace wing, in reinforced concrete, and unifying the three facades by late 1933. The extended location, covering some 1,700 m2, came to house a rotary printing press which was also in use by the magazine Realitatea IlustratƒÉ, a conference hall, a cafeteria and sleeping quarters for the janitors. The post-1920 issues introduced a number of changes in format. It began hosting photojournalistic pieces by Iosif Berman, one of Romania's celebrated photographers (who had made his debut with Diminea»õa in 1913).Domnica Macri, \\"Un fotograf rom√¢n √Æn National Geographic\\", in National Geographic Magazine Romanian edition, June 2008, p.39 Emanuel BƒÉdescu, \\"Fotografi din Rom√¢nia interbelicƒÉ\\", in Ziarul Financiar, February 15, 2008 AdevƒÉrul began headlining its front page with a short listing of the top news of the day, often accompanied by sarcastic editorial commentary. Among the other innovations were regular columns discussing developments in literature and philosophy, written by two young modernist authors, Benjamin Fondane and Ion Vinea, as well as a theater chronicle by Fagure and Iosif NƒÉdejde. Vinea's texts discussed literary authenticity, eclecticism, and consistent praises of modern lyrical prose.Cernat, p.73-77 Other such articles followed Vinea's rivalry with his former colleague Tristan Tzara, and stated his rejection of Dadaism, a radical avant-garde current that Tzara had formed in Switzerland during the war.Cernat, p.73, 127-128 In 1922, Vinea went on to establish Contimporanul, an influential modernist and socialist tribune, which maintained warm contact with AdevƒÉrul. Around that time, AdevƒÉrul had a printing-press contract with Alexandru Tzaran, the socialist activist and entrepreneur, whose company also published avant-garde books,Sandqvist, p.178, 180 and revisited projects for creating a literary supplement. In 1920, it set up Adevƒïrul Literar »ôi Artistic, soon to be rated one of the prominent Romanian cultural journals. Seven years later, it also began printing a magazine for Romanian Radio enthusiasts, under the title Radio Adevƒïrul. Adriana Dumitran, \\"Prezen≈£a Casei Regale √Æn programele Radiodifuziunii Rom√¢ne √Æn perioada interbelicƒÉ\\", in the National Library of Romania's Revista Bibliotecii Na≈£ionale, Nr. 2/2006, p.32-36 The newspaper was involved in cultural debates over the following two decades. It attracted contributions from various cultural ideologists, among them critics »ôerban Cioculescu, Petru Comarnescu, Eugen Lovinescu and Paul Zarifopol, writers Demostene Botez, Eugeniu Botez, Victor Eftimiu, Eugen Jebeleanu and Camil Petrescu, and Aromanian cultural activist Nicolae Constantin Batzaria. Beginning 1928, Cioculescu took over the AdevƒÉrul literary column. That same year, AdevƒÉrul hosted part of the dispute between Cioculescu and another prominent critic of the period, Perpessicius, the former of whom accused the latter of being too eclectic and generous.Cernat, p.316 In 1931, it circulated young critic Lucian Boz's defense of Tzara and praise for sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, both of whom, he stressed, had brought \\"fresh Romanian air into the realm of Western culture\\".Cernat, p.331 By 1932, it was hosting contributions from George CƒÉlinescu, including one which criticized his former disciple Boz, and excerpts from Lovinescu's memoirs. Iordan Datcu, \\"LazƒÉr ≈ûƒÉineanu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 15/2009 In 1937, AdevƒÉrul hosted a polemic between Lovinescu and his disciple Felix Aderca, where the topic was avant-garde hero Urmuz,Cernat, p.348 and a special column for women in culture. Probably conceived by feminist writer Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan (already known to AdevƒÉrul readers as a popularizer of English literature), it was signed by several prominent women of the day. Bianca Bur≈£a-Cernat, \\" 'Femeile √Æntre ele' √Æn 1937\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 290, October 2005 Editura Adevƒïrul signed on some of the best-selling authors in modern Romanian literature, among them Sadoveanu, CƒÉlinescu, Eugeniu Botez, Liviu Rebreanu and Gala Galaction. It also put out several other popular works, such as memoirs and essays by Queen Marie of Romania, the comedic hit Titanic Vals by Tudor Mu»ôatescu, and, after 1934, a number of primary school textbooks. By the mid-1930s, AdevƒÉrul had launched sister magazines dedicated to photo-reportage (Realitatea IlustratƒÉ), Hollywood films (Film) and health (Medicul Nostru). Cornel Ungureanu, \\"√éntre Dr. Ygrec ≈üi Dr. Eliade, Dr. Broch\\" , in Orizont, Nr. 8/2007, p.2 Clashes with the far right Both AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa were noted for their rejection of interwar antisemitism, and for condemning the far right and fascist segment of the political spectrum. Romanian fascism was at the time grouped around the National-Christian Defense League (LANC), presided upon by AdevƒÉruls old adversary A. C. Cuza. During 1921, the liberal Fagure ridiculed the supposed threat of Jewish communization in newly acquired Bessarabia, countering the supposed threat of Jewish Bolshevism (officially endorsed and publicized by Universul).Livezeanu, p.253-255 At the time, AdevƒÉrul was even voicing criticism of Soviet Russia from the left: young Brunea-Fox discussed an anti-Soviet workers' rebellion as a movement for individual freedoms. In 1923, AdevƒÉrul publishing house printed a booklet by the leftist whistleblower Emanoil Socor, wherein proof was given that A. C. Cuza's academic career rested on plagiarism.Veiga, p.69. See also Butaru, p.92-93 The same year, the LANC's entire paramilitary wing, including young activist Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, was rounded up by the authorities. These uncovered the fascists' plan to murder various National Liberal politicians, the editors of Lupta, and AdevƒÉrul manager Iacob Rosenthal.Veiga, p.76, 94 AdevƒÉrul later published the results of an investigation by anti- fascist reporter Dinu DumbravƒÉ, who discussed LANC involvement in the 1925 pogrom of Foc»ôani, and mentioned that the educational system was being penetrated by antisemites.Livezeanu, p.283 In 1927, it joined the condemnation of LANC-sponsored violence in Transylvania: a contributor, the lawyer-activist Dem. I. Dobrescu, referred to Codreanu and his men as Romania's \\"shame\\".Giuseppe Motta, Le minoranze nel XX secolo: dallo stato nazionale all'integrazione europea, FrancoAngeli, Milan, 2006, p.109. In December 1930, leftist sociologist Mihai Ralea, one of the main figures in the Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ circle, chose AdevƒÉrul as the venue for his essay RƒÉzbunarea no»õiunii de democra»õie (\\"Avenging the Notion of Democracy\\"), which condemned the then-popular theory that democratic regimes were inferior to totalitarian ones.Ornea (1995), p.63 AdevƒÉrul reported with concern on some other conspiracies against the legitimate government, including officer Victor Precup's attempt to assassinate King Carol II on Good Friday 1934. Vlad Stoicescu, Andrei CrƒÉciun, \\"Oltenii, 'pericol social' \\" , in Evenimentul Zilei, April 26, 2008 In parallel, AdevƒÉrul took an interest in promoting alternatives to nationalist theories. It thus attempted to mediate the ongoing disputes between Romania and Hungary, an editorial policy notably taken up in 1923, when the exiled Hungarian intellectual Oszk√°r J√°szi visited Bucharest. In that context, AdevƒÉrul published J√°szi's interview with Constantin Costa- Foru, wherein J√°szi mapped out a Danubian Confederation scheme, criticizing \\"thoughts of war and sentiments of hatred\\" among both Romanians and Magyars.Litv√°n, p.248-249 In another AdevƒÉrul piece, J√°szi's vision was commended as a democratic alternative to the authoritarian Hungarian Regency regime, leading Hungarian Ambassador Iv√°n Rubido-Zichy to express his displeasure.Litv√°n, p.252-253 Later, even as J√°szi arose the suspicions of many Romanians and was shunned by the Hungarian community in Romania, AdevƒÉrul still expressed sympathy for his cause, notably with a 1935 essay by Transylvanian journalist Ion Clopo»õel.Litv√°n, p.407 The newspaper also denounced interwar Germany's attempts to absorb Austria (a proto-Anschluss), primarily because they stood to channel Hungary's revanchism.Alfred D. Low, The Anschluss Movement, 1918‚Äì1919, and the Paris Peace Conference, American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1974, p.356. It also reported with much sarcasm on the friendly contacts between the Romanian nationalists at LANC and the Hungarian revanchist Szeged Fascists.Giuseppe Motta, Un rapporto difficile: Romania e Stati Uniti nel periodo interbellico, FrancoAngeli, Milan, 2006, p.113. Meanwhile, AdevƒÉrul was vividly critical of centralizing policies in post-1920 \\"Greater Romania\\", primarily in Transylvania and Bessarabia. Articles on this topic were mainly contributed by Onisifor Ghibu, a former activist for the Transylvanian Romanian cause.Livezeanu, p.96, 163 One of the new causes in which AdevƒÉrul involved itself after 1918 was birth control, which it supported from a eugenic perspective. This advocacy was foremost illustrated by the regular medical column of 1923, signed Doctor Ygrec (the pseudonym of a Jewish practitioner), which proposed both prenuptial certificates and the legalization of abortion.Bucur, p.201-202, 204-205, 263-264 The issues attracted much interest after Ygrec and his counterpart at Universul, who expressed moral and social objections, debated the matter for an entire month.Bucur, p.201-202 While voicing such concerns, AdevƒÉrul itself published prejudiced claims, such as a 1928 article by physician George D. IonƒÉ»ôescu, who portrayed the steady migration of Oltenian natives into Bucharest as a \\"social danger\\" which brought with it \\"promiscuity, squalor and infection\\", and called for restrictions on internal migration. Generally anti- racist, the paper helped publicize the alternative, anti-fascist racialism proposed by Henric Sanielevici in the 1930s.Butaru, p.27, 209, 312, 325 AdevƒÉrul also published a 1929 piece by Nicolae Constantin Batzaria, in which the latter showed his adversity to radical forms of feminism, recommending women to find their comfort in marriage.Maria Bucur, \\"Romania\\", in Kevin Passmore (ed.), Women, Gender, and Fascism in Europe, 1919-45, Manchester University Press, Manchester, 2003, p.72. By the mid-1930s, the tension between AdevƒÉrul and the increasingly pro-fascist Universul degenerated into open confrontation. Emil Pauker's newspapers were by then also being targeted by the new fascist movement known as the Iron Guard, led by former LANC member Codreanu: in 1930, one of its editors was shot by a follower of Codreanu, but escaped with his life.Clark, p.353 According to the recollections of PCR activist Silviu Brucan, the Iron Guardists, who supported Universul, attacked distributors of AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa, prompting young communist and socialists to organize themselves into vigilante groups and fight back, which in turn led to a series of street battles. Beginning 1935, the scandals also involved SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ, a virulent far right newspaper headed by Nichifor Crainic and funded by Stelian Popescu, the new publisher of Universul.Ornea (1995), p.245 While engaged in this conflict, AdevƒÉrul stood out among local newspapers for supporting the PCR during a 1936 trial of its activists which took place in Craiova, and involved as a co-defendant Simion Pauker's daughter-in-law, Ana Pauker. Mainstream politician Constantin Argetoianu, citing an unnamed AdevƒÉrul journalist, had it that Emil Pauker, otherwise an outspoken anti-communist, was trying to protect even the more estranged members of his family. With the change in management, some of the established AdevƒÉrul authors moved to Universul. This was the case with C. Bacalba»ôa (1935) and Batzaria (1936).Kemal H. Karpat, \\"The Memoirs of N. Batzaria: The Young Turks and Nationalism\\", in Studies on Ottoman Social and Political History, Brill Publishers, Leiden, Boston & Cologne, 2002, p.564. In his Universul columns, the latter displayed a degree of sympathy for the extreme right movement.Hans-Christian Maner, Parlamentarismus in Rum√§nien (1930‚Äì1940): Demokratie im autorit√§ren Umfeld, R. Oldenbourg Verlag, Munich, 1997, p.323-324. ; Valentin SƒÉndulescu, \\"La puesta en escena del martirio: La vida pol√≠tica de dos cad√°veres.

Usos y abusos del ritual f√∫nebre en la Europa del siglo XX, Catarata, Madrid, 2009, p.260, 264. In summer 1936, the Paukers sold their stock to a consortium of businessmen with National Liberal connections, which was headed by Emanoil TƒÉtƒÉrescu, the brother of acting Premier Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu. Mihail Sadoveanu succeeded Graur as editor-in- chief, while also taking over leadership of Diminea»õa,Ornea (1995), p.459-465 and Eugen Lovinescu became a member of the company's executive panel. With this change in management came a new stage in the conflict opposing AdevƒÉrul to the far right press. Through the voices of Crainic, Alexandru Gregorian and N. Crevedia, the two extremist journals Porunca Vremii and SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ repeatedly targeted Sadoveanu with antisemitic and antimasonic epithets, accusing him of having become a tool for Jewish interests and, as leader of the Romanian Freemasonry, of promoting occult practices. The controversy also involved modernist poet Tudor Arghezi, whose writings Sadoveanu defended against charges of \\"pornography\\" coming from the nationalist press. AdevƒÉrul did in fact back similar charges against novelist Mircea Eliade, who was in conflict with Teodorescu-Brani»ôte, and whom Doctor Ygrec dismissed as an \\"erotomaniac\\". =1946 edition=1937 ban and recovery AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa, together with Lupta, were suppressed in 1937, when the fascist National Christian Party of Octavian Goga, successor to the LANC and rival of the Iron Guard, took over government. This was primarily an antisemitic measure among several racial discrimination laws adopted with the consent of Carol II, the increasingly authoritarian monarch, and officially credited the notion according to which both venues were \\"Jewish\\".Final Report, p.40-41, 91-92; Ornea (1995), p.392, 402. See also Butaru, p.272 The decision to close down the publications was accompanied by a nationalization of their assets, which reportedly included a large part of Iosif Berman's negatives. In one of the paper's last issues, Teodorescu-Brani»ôte warned against the identification of democracy \\"within the limits of constitutional monarchy\\" with Bolshevism, noting that AdevƒÉruls enemies had willingly introduced such a confusion.Final Report, p.94-95 In his diary of World War II events, BrƒÉni»ôteanu described the ban as having inaugurated the era of \\"barbarity\\". This referred to the bloody clash between Carol and the Iron Guard, to Goga's downfall, and to the establishment of a three successive wartime dictatorships: Carol's National Renaissance Front, the Guard's National Legionary State, and the authoritarian regime of ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu. The three regimes organized successive purges of Jewish and left-wing journalists, preventing several of the AdevƒÉrul employees from working in the field. G. BrƒÉtescu, \\"Uniunea Ziari≈ütilor Profesioni≈üti, 1919‚Äì2009. Compendiu aniversar\\" , in Mesagerul de Bistri≈£a- NƒÉsƒÉud, December 11, 2009 During its episodic rise to power, the Iron Guard mapped out its revenge against people associated with AdevƒÉrul, dividing its former staff into three categories: \\"kikes\\", \\"traitors\\", and \\"minions\\". Nichifor Crainic, who served as Minister of Propaganda under both the National Legionary State and Antonescu, took pride in his own campaign against \\"Judaism\\" in the press, and, speaking at the 1941 anniversary of his tribune G√¢ndirea, referred to Goga's 1937 action against AdevƒÉrul and the others as a \\"splendid act of justice\\".Final Report, p.92; Ornea (1995), p.402 According to one story, the palatial office formerly belonging to AdevƒÉrul was still at the center of a conflict between underground communists and the Guard: during the Legionary Rebellion of January 1941, the PCR attempted to set it on fire and then blame the arson on the fascists, but this plan was thwarted by press photographer Nicolae Ionescu. Both AdevƒÉrul and Diminea»õa were restored on April 13, 1946, two years since the August 1944 Coup ended Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany by bringing down Antonescu. The new editorial staff was led by the aging newspaperman BrƒÉni»ôteanu and the new collective owner was the joint stock company SƒÉrindar S. A. The daily did not have its headquarters in SƒÉrindar (which was allocated to the LuceafƒÉrul Printing House), but remained in the same general area, on Matei Millo Street and later on Brezoianu Street. In the first issue of its new series, AdevƒÉrul carried BrƒÉni»ôteanu's promise of pursuing the same path as Mille, and was accompanied by a reprint of Mille's political testament. BrƒÉni»ôteanu's article stated: \\"We did not and will not belong to any person, to any government, to any party.\\" The series coincided with a spell of pluralism contested by the Soviet Union's occupation of Romania, the steady communization of stately affairs, and political moves to create a communist regime. BrƒÉni»ôteanu noted these developments in his debut editorial of 1946, with a positive spin: \\"We ought to be blind not to have admitted that, in these new times, new men must step and do step to the leadership. We do not shy away from saying that, in general lines, our views meet with those of socialist democracy, for the preparation of which we have been struggling our entire lives and which is about to be set up here, as well as in most parts of the European continent, after being fulfilled in Russia.\\" Communist censorship Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu died in December 1947, just days before the Kingdom was replaced with a pro-Soviet people's republic in which the dominant force was the PCR. Ioan LƒÉcustƒÉ, \\"√én Bucure»ôti, acum 50 de ani. Decembrie 1947\\", in Magazin Istoric, December 1947 The gazette celebrated the political transition, publishing the official communique proclaiming the republic, and commenting on it: \\"A new face of Romanian history has begun [sic] yesterday. What follows is the Romanian state, which today, as well as tomorrow, will require everyone's disciplined and concentrated work.\\" Honored with a front-page obituary, BrƒÉni»ôteanu was succeeded by H. Soreanu, who led AdevƒÉrul for the following two years. Soreanu was originally from the city of Roman, where he had presided over a local gazette. Doris Mironescu, \\"M. Blecher ≈üi ora≈üul de provincie: fotograme dintr-o realitate ideologicƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 1118, August 2011 In stages after that date, AdevƒÉrul was affected by communist censorship: according to historian Cristian Vasile, while generally infused with \\"official propaganda\\", the paper overall failed in effecting \\"the transformation requested by the [new] regime.\\"Vasile, p.78 Its content grew more politicized, offering praise to Soviet and Communist party initiatives such as the five-year plans, the encouragement and spread of atheism, and the promotion of Russian literature. Nevertheless, it continued to publish more traditional articles, including pieces signed by Brunea-Fox and poet Demostene Botez, as well as the regular columns Carnetul nostru (\\"Our Notebook\\"), Cronica evenimentelor externe (\\"The Chronicle of Foreign Events\\"), Cronica muzicalƒÉ (\\"The Musical Chronicle\\"), Glose politice (\\"Political Glosses\\"), Ultima orƒÉ (\\"Latest News\\"), and the cartoon section Chestia zilei (\\"The Daily Issue\\"). Another satirical section, titled Tablete (\\"Tablets\\") and contributed by Tudor Arghezi, existed between 1947 and 1948; it came to an abrupt end when Arghezi was banned, having been singled out for his \\"decadent\\" poetry in Sorin Toma's ideological column for Sc√Ænteia, the main communist mouthpiece (see Socialist realism in Romania). In early 1948, AdevƒÉrul was also hosting some of the few independently voiced theater chronicles of the day, including a subversive contribution from the self-exiled author Monica Lovinescu, where she indirectly referred to communism as Kafkaesque experimentation.Vasile, p.127 The newspaper was eventually placed under an \\"editorial committee\\", whose effective leader was Communist Party boss Leonte RƒÉutu, and whose mission was to prepare AdevƒÉrul for liquidation. In early 1951, at a time when the communist regime closed down all autonomous press venues, AdevƒÉrul was taken out of print. In its final issue (18,039th of March 31, 1951), the paper informed that: \\"the working class has set up a new press, emerging from the new development of society: a press for the masses, read and written by millions. [It] expresses the tendencies and higher level of socialist culture; it debates on a daily basis the problems of ideology, of social and political theory, of science and technology, in connection with the preoccupations, the struggles and the victories in the field of labor, intertwined with the vast issues posed by the effort of socialist construction. The mission of Adevƒïrul newspaper is over.\\"Partly rendered in Vasile, p.78 Cristian Vasile notes that the \\"official explanation\\" for suppressing AdevƒÉrul was \\"ridiculous and unconvincing.\\" Indication that the closure occurred unexpectedly also comes from AdevƒÉruls failure to cancel its subscriptions in advance. =1989 edition=1989 reestablishment and support for the FSN A daily paper with the name AdevƒÉrul was again set up in the immediate aftermath of the 1989 Revolution, which had toppled the communist regime and its one-party system. The publication, which is housed by Casa Presei Libere, is often described as a direct successor to the PCR organ Sc√Ænteia (rival of the 1940s AdevƒÉrul).Berry, p.39, 54; TismƒÉneanu, p.357-358 Adrian Cioroianu, \\"Les avatars d'une 'nation ex-communiste': un regard sur l'historiographie roumaine recente\\" , in Nation and National Ideology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Held at New Europe College, Bucharest.

Whitney, \\"Upheaval in the East; Like the Party, East Europe's Official Communist Press Is in Deep Trouble\\", in The New York Times, February 12, 1990 Three intermediary issues were published during the actual revolutionary events; a free one-page issue on December 22 and two further issues on December 23 and 24 respectively, under the title Sc√Ænteia Poporului (\\"The People's Spark\\"), which published appeals issued by the provisional post-communist leadership forum, the National Salvation Front (FSN), adopting the name AdevƒÉrul starting December 25. As one of its first measures, the new editorial board dismissed members of the staff who were discredited for having openly supported the last communist ruler, Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, replacing them with journalists sympathetic to the FSN.Berry, p.39 Soon after Ceau»ôescu's execution, the gazette began serializing Red Horizons, a volume of recollections exposing the defunct regime, authored by Ion Mihai Pacepa, a defector and former spy chief. At the time, it circulated the claim, supported by the FSN, that Ceau»ôescu's repression of the popular revolt had killed as many as 60,000 people, which was a 60-fold increase of the actual death toll. Edited after its resurgence by the pro-FSN poet and translator Darie NovƒÉceanu, Andrei Badin, \\"√én 1990, CTP lƒÉuda faptele de vitejie ale minerilor\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, June 18, 2005 AdevƒÉrul became the dominant left-wing newspaper of post-communist Romania. In parallel, Diminea»õa was itself revived, and, although independent from AdevƒÉrul, was also a FSN mouthpiece.Berindei et al., p.37sqq; Ioanid, p.248 Their main right-wing rival was another former Communist Party venue, Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, which openly reproached on the FSN that it was monopolizing power, and which identified itself with liberalism and pluralism.Berry, p.37sqq Reflecting back on the early 1990s, Southampton Institute researcher David Berry argued: \\"the ideological forces associated with the previous Stalinist regime were pitted against a much smaller and disparate oppositional group. This latter group was associated with Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ that loosely represented the voice of liberalism and [...] clearly lost the war. This was a battle of ideas and the old forces of Romanian communism used the new press framework, through AdevƒÉrul, to discredit opposition forces.\\"Berry, p.37 In 1990, both papers reputedly sold around 1 million copies each day,Berry, p.55 a pattern attributed to \\"news deprivation\\" under communism, and believed by Berry to be \\"a phenomenal figure in comparison to any leading Western nation\\".Berry, p.55-56 T√¢rgu Mure»ô conflict and 1990 Mineriad \\"Golaniad\\" protest in downtown Bucharest, 1990 In this context, AdevƒÉrul advertised that its main purpose was the dissemination of \\"nothing but the truth\\", of \\"exact information\\". The paper however stood out for promoting nationalist, populist and authoritarian concepts, which Berry has associated with the survival of previous national communist themes in FSN discourse.Berry, p.37-38, 53, 54-55 Such theses acquired particularly controversial representations during the violent T√¢rgu Mure»ô riots of March 1990. Backing the official view according to which the ethnic Hungarian community was organizing itself in separatist struggle, it dedicated space to articles targeting the opposition Democratic Union of Hungarians (UDMR). Initially, Berry notes, AdevƒÉrul reported claims of extremist Hungarians in Transylvania committing vandalism against national monuments while acknowledging that the UDMR was not endorsing such acts, but slowly became a tribune for encouraging ethnic Romanians to take action, exclusively presenting its public with politicized and unmitigated information provided by the official agency Rompres and by the Romanian ultra-nationalist group Vatra Rom√¢neascƒÉ.Berry, p.39-41, 43-44, 46 Its editorials, often based on rumors, included negative portrayals of Hungarians, methods described by Berry as \\"extremely xenophobic\\", \\"unethical\\" and forms of \\"political manipulation\\".Berry, p.42 AdevƒÉrul displayed constant hostility toward the Golaniad protests in Bucharest, which ranged for much of early 1990, and expressed praise for the Mineriad of June 13‚Äì15, 1990. During the latter, miners from the Jiu Valley, instigated by some of the officials, entered Bucharest and quashed the opposition's sit-in. Early on, the gazette called on the Romanian Police to forcefully evict the Golaniad demonstrators, whom it accused of encouraging \\"filth\\" and \\"promiscuity\\".Berindei et al., p.41 It also depicted the Golaniad as a major conspiracy, mounted against a legitimate government by neofascist and Iron Guard groups.Berindei et al., p.41-42, 71, 86-87, 139-140, 205-207 Together with the FSN's Azi, it commended the pro- government workers at IMGB, the heavy machinery works, who attempted to force out the crowds, depicting it as an answer to alleged student violence against Police operatives.Berindei et al., p.58-59, 71-72, 86-87 When the miners organized a definitive clampdown, depicted in AdevƒÉrul as a peaceful takeover, the newspaper was one of the several Casa Presei Libere operations left untouched by the Mineriad.Berindei et al., p.188 During the following days, it published material praising the miners for reestablishing order,Berindei et al., p.41, 201-204; Berry, p.51-52 while alleging that \\"their presence was absolutely necessary to annihilate the violence of extremist forces\\".Berry, p.51-52 It also popularized false rumors according to which, during their attacks on the opposition National Peasant and National Liberal party headquarters, the miners had confiscated weapons, counterfeit money and illegal drugs.Berindei et al., p.205-207 In addition to main editor NovƒÉceanu, whose articles were congratulatory of \\"our miners\\", journalists who praised the Mineriad include Sergiu Andon (future Conservative Party politician), Cristian Tudor Popescu and Corina DrƒÉgotescu. Radical nationalism was observed in several AdevƒÉrul articles throughout the FSN period. In one piece of March 22, days after the main Hungarian-Romanian clashes, writer Romulus Vulpescu described the danger of \\"irredentism\\" and \\"Horthyism\\", alleging that local Hungarians had assassinated several Romanian peasants.Berry, p.43 Vulpescu and other contributors repeatedly made unverifiable claims according to which Hungary was directly involved in stirring resentments, allegations also made by the state-controlled television network.Berry, p.46 According to Romanian- born historian Radu Ioanid, in 1990‚Äì1991 AdevƒÉrul and its opponent Dreptatea of the anti-FSN National Peasants' Party both \\"joined the anti-Semitic barrage\\" of the period, a trend he believes was instigated by the publications of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, Iosif Constantin DrƒÉgan and Eugen Barbu (all of them affiliated with Rom√¢nia Mare magazine).Ioanid, p.246-247 Ioanid singled out AdevƒÉrul and its collaborator Cristian Tudor Popescu, who, during the July 1991 commemoration of the Ia»ôi pogrom, attacked writer Elie Wiesel and other Holocaust researchers for having evidenced Ion Antonescu's complicity in extermination.Ioanid, p.248 In the early 1990s, AdevƒÉrul also stood out for its intense republicanism which opposed the return of communist-deposed King Michael I, and published polemical pieces such as the Fir-ai al naibii, majestate (\\"Curse You, Your Majesty\\", written by Andon).Ruxandra Irina Cioc√Ærlan, \\"Sergiu Andon: Casa RegalƒÉ √Æmi aduce o razƒÉ de speran≈£ƒÉ\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 382: Dosar: De la regalitate la realitate, June 2011; Patrick Andr√© de Hillerin, \\"Trecutul recent\\" , in SƒÉptƒÉm√¢na FinanciarƒÉ, May 11, 2007 The privatization years AdevƒÉrul staff in the early to mid-1990s. Dumitru Tinu, Cristian Tudor Popescu, Adrian Ursu etc. in the foreground A scandal surfaced in spring 1991, when AdevƒÉrul was caught up in the first wave of privatization, following a decision of the FSN's Petre Roman cabinet. A conflict reportedly opposed NovƒÉceanu to Popescu: the latter suspected a secret understanding between Roman and the AdevƒÉrul leadership, providing for a facade privatization and transferring financial control to FSN politicians. This controversy ended only when Premier Roman appointed NovƒÉceanu as Romanian Ambassador to Spain. The Sc√Ænteia patrimony was afterward divided between AdevƒÉrul and the state. In parallel, seeking to consolidate their publications' independence, the writing staff set up a joint stock company, AdevƒÉrul Holding.Berry, p.75 Known initially as SC AdevƒÉrul SA, it had its initial public offering distributed through the \\"MEBO method\\" of employee buyouts. Cristian Hostiuc, Lucian M√Ændru≈£ƒÉ, \\"Cristian Tudor Popescu, pre≈üedinte interimar la AdevƒÉrul\\", in Ziarul Financiar, January 10, 2003 As a result, the journalists owned 60% and other employees the other 40%, with a clause forbidding them from selling to outside investors (in effect until 2002). Subsequent trading within the holding and seasoned equity offerings provided the editorial staff with a controlling stock of approx. 30%. As part of its business profile, the post-privatization AdevƒÉrul also earned criticism for not differentiating between articles and commercial content, publishing covert advertisements as opinion pieces.Manuela Preoteasa, \\"The Powerful Defeated Media\\", in Media Online, December 28, 2004; retrieved April 18, 2009 Also at that stage, allegations surfaced that, through a firm known as SC Colosal Import-Export, members of the editorial staff, including Andon, Viorel SƒÉlƒÉgean and Dumitru Tinu, were handling all the larger advertising revenues. Occasionally, nationalist claims produced by AdevƒÉrul parted with the policies of FSN's Social Democratic (PSD) successors, particularly in matters relating to social issues and Romania's economy. In June 1993, the gazette attacked the PSD's Nicolae VƒÉcƒÉroiu cabinet for its privatization measures, claiming that the sale of the Petromin shipping firm to Greek investors was done \\"at a pittance\\", and calling on the government to resign.Judy Batt, \\"Political Dimensions of Privatization in Eastern Europe\\", in Paul G. Hare, Junior R. Davis (eds.), Transition to the Market Economy. Critical Perspectives on the World Economy, Vol. II, Routledge, London, 1997, p.240. This campaign, British political scientist Judy Batt notes, had a \\"xenophobic tinge\\", and its appeal \\"has shaken confidence in the government and eroded its capacity for action.\\" After the post-Revolution authorities announced their intention to join the European Union and accepted a monitoring process, the newspaper hosted the first in a long series of Euroskeptic pieces, which generally objected to outside intervention, particularly in the area of human rights, and were often signed by columnists Popescu and Bogdan Chireac.Gallagher, p.115-116, 123 British academic and observer Tom Gallagher attributes this attitude to claims of \\"injured patriotism\\".Gallagher, p.115 In parallel, AdevƒÉrul displayed a strong socially conservative agenda. During those years, the paper published numerous pieces covering Romanian society, which were primarily noted for their sensationalist and alarmist headlines, such as a claim, published in 1997, that \\"a quarter of Romania's children live in institutions\\".Ana Muntean, Maria Roth, \\"Romania\\", in Beth M. Schwartz-Kenney, Michelle McCauley, Michelle A. Epstein (eds.), Child Abuse: a Global Perspective, Greenwood Publishing Group, Westport, 2001, p.188-189. In early 1996, AdevƒÉrul was noted for criticizing local non-governmental organizations promoting women's rights, alleging that, although financed by the European Union's Phare fund, they only functioned on paper (an attitude which itself earned criticism for sexism).Laura Grunberg, \\"Women's NGOs in Romania\\", in Susan Gal, Gail Kligman (eds.), Reproducing Gender: Politics, Publics and Everyday Life after Socialism, Princeton University Press, 2000, p.329-330. More debates ensued in March 1998, when Cristian Tudor Popescu published an AdevƒÉrul article under the title Femeia nu e om (\\"The Woman Is Not a Human Being\\", or \\"The Woman Is Not a Man\\"), where he alleged that women cannot think.Florence Maurice, \\"Deconstructing Gender ‚Äî The Case of Romanian\\", in Marlis Hellinger, Hadumod Bussmann (eds.), Gender across Languages: The Linguistic Representation of Women and Men, Vol. I, John Benjamins Publishing Company, Amsterdam & Philadelphia, 2001, p.247. Another controversy of the mid-1990s also involved Popescu, criticized for his AdevƒÉrul articles which, claiming freedom of thought as their motivation, supported the cause of convicted French Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy.Final Report, p.363 A political scandal touched AdevƒÉrul some time after the 1996 legislative election, when the Social Democrats' rivals from the Democratic Convention, Democratic Party and other opposition groups formed government. This came after the new Foreign Minister, Adrian Severin, publicly stated being in possession of a list comprising the names of several leading Romanian journalists who were agents of the Russian Federal Security Service. Monica Iordache Apostol, Aniela Nine, Gabriela Antoniu, \\"Mape de candida≈£i pentru Bruxelles\\" , in Jurnalul Na≈£ional, April 15, 2009 Andi TopalƒÉ, \\"DouƒÉ 'secrete' legate de fostul director de la AdevƒÉrul revin simultan √Æn actualitate. Cine mai crede √Æn coinciden≈£e?\\" , in Gardianul, October 26, 2006 Even though Severin's failure to evidence the claim resulted in his resignation, the list fueled much speculation, including rumors that Dumitru Tinu, by then one of the main AdevƒÉrul editors, was one of the people in question. The dispute prolonged itself over the following decade, particularly after Tinu's name was again used by President Emil Constantinescu and former Foreign Intelligence Service director Ioan Talpe»ô in their recollections of the Severin incident. Late 1990s emancipation Various commentators have noted a rise in the newspaper's informative quality later in the 1990s. Among them is British politician and MEP Emma Nicholson, who followed Romania's political scene throughout the decade. She singled out AdevƒÉrul and Romania's other major central daily, Evenimentul Zilei, as \\"high quality publications\\".Nicholson, p.65 Writing in 2002, Romanian media researcher Alex Ulmanu rated AdevƒÉrul \\"the most successful, and arguably the best Romanian daily\\".Alex Ulmanu, \\"The Romanian Media Landscape: Impressive Media Offer, Particularly in Broadcast and Written Media Field\\", in Media Online, April 16, 2002; retrieved April 18, 2009 Romanian sociologist and political commentator Marian Petcu sees its enduring popularity as the consequence of a \\"head start\\", with AdevƒÉrul having inherited from Sc√Ænteia \\"the facilities, the subscribers, the raw materials, the headquarters, the superstructure, the network of local correspondents etc.\\" He also notes that the newer publication had produced a \\"less warlike and less anti-communist\\" discourse than those of other dailies, and therefore appealing to a wider audience. By 2004, Petcu argues, AdevƒÉrul maintained a \\"balance between a reconciliatory but well documented discourse, on the one hand, and, on the other, the observance of journalistic norms and resistance to the temptation to make compromises.\\" According to surveys carried out around 2004, the paper was being perceived as the most credible title. Its circulation reached a reported 150,000 copies a day, making it one of at most four local dailies to print more than 100,000, and maintaining its lead over all local newspapers, directly above Evenimentul Zilei and Libertatea. Other data for 2003 places that number at approx. 200,000, roughly equal to that of Evenimentul Zilei, and ranking above Libertatea and Cotidianul (with 140,000 and 120,000 copies respectively).Imogen Bell (ed.), Central and South-eastern Europe 2003, Routledge, London, p.501. According to Evenimentul Zilei, the circulation of AdevƒÉrul actually dropped from 200,000 in 1998‚Äì2000 to 100,000 in the post-2001 era, whereas external auditors revealed that, in 2003, it was the fifth most-read newspaper (after Libertatea, Evenimentul Zilei, Pro Sport and Gazeta Sporturilor). Alongside Evenimentul Zilei and Pro Sport, AdevƒÉrul was also one of the first Romanian periodicals to take an interest in putting out an online edition and adopting innovations in web design, making its site the third most popular of its kind in 2002 (the year of its relaunch). Both Tinu and Popescu helped consolidate their publication's reputation through their numerous television appearances, coming to be seen as leaders of opinion. According to Petcu, the public's confidence was what made AdevƒÉrul \\"autonomous from the political power\\", while Nicholson attributes such progress to Popescu, whom she sees as \\"a journalistic icon\\".Nicholson, p.66 At the end of the transition, Petcu assessed the new AdevƒÉrul agenda as one in favor of social justice, social security and \\"fast privatization that would avoid massive unemployment\\". At the time, the paper's panelists also threw their support behind European integration, a change in political orientation illustrated by Chireac's talk show on Pro TV station, titled Pro Vest (\\"Pro West\\").Cristian ≈ûtefƒÉnescu, \\"Themes and Variations of European Integration: The Romanians 'Just Do It' \\", in Media Online, September 2, 2002; retrieved April 18, 2009 In 2003, Popescu was a co-founder and, after Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ editor Petre Mihai BƒÉcanu withdrew from the race, first president of the Romanian Press Club, a professional association whose mission was setting ethical standards in journalism.Berry, p.76 Despite such gestures, the paper continued to withstand accusations that it was itself unprofessional. Ulmanu argued that both AdevƒÉrul and its smaller competitor Curentul were examples of press striving to be considered \\"high quality\\", but noted: \\"However, one can still find biased, unprofessional or sensationalist reporting in these papers.\\" Disputes also surround its political agenda of the 2000‚Äì2004 period. Like the other mainstream publications, AdevƒÉrul supported the PSD-backed Ion Iliescu in the presidential election runoff of late 2000, against the ultra- nationalist rival of the Greater Romania Party, Corneliu Vadim Tudor.Donald G. McNeil, Jr., \\"Fears Voiced over Prospect Romanian Racist May Win\\", in The New York Times, December 3, 2000 In this context, it notably published a piece questioning Tudor's self-identification as a firm adherent of Romanian Orthodoxy, suggesting that he presented himself to foreigners as a Baptist Union adherent. Opinions vary about the gazette's relationship with the PSD after the 2000 legislative election, which consecrated the socialists' return in government. Some commentators see AdevƒÉrul as a staunch critic of the resulting cabinet and of PSD policy-maker Adrian NƒÉstase. Cristian Teodorescu, \\"Un subiect gras\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 48/2006TismƒÉneanu, p.289 However, journalist and academic Manuela Preoteasa highlights the PSD's \\"pressure on the media\\", and includes AdevƒÉrul among venues which, \\"apparently critical toward PSD [...] avoided criticizing some of the party leaders\\". In Marian Petcu's view, AdevƒÉrul adopted \\"a discourse stressing the need for prudence and balance, alternated with criticism of the political power whenever the latter failed to take firm decisions.\\" Changes in management AdevƒÉrul also consolidated financial transparency, when the new editorial board, extended to include newcomers Chireac, Lelia Munteanu and Adrian Ursu, took over the role of supervisor in matters of advertising. In 2001‚Äì2003, Tinu purchased most stock owned by his colleagues, and came to own over 70% of the total shares, of which some 10% were purchased from Popescu in exchange for 140,000 United States dollars. Suspicions arose that Tinu was being secretly financed in this effort by the Jordanian businessman Fathi Taher, already known for purchasing much advertisement space in AdevƒÉrul during the mid-1990s, and receiving additional support from PSD politician and entrepreneur Viorel Hrebenciuc. According to a 2003 analysis in Ziarul Financiar, AdevƒÉrul was considered for purchase by the French group Hachette, and later by a Polish conglomerate. In 2003, Tinu died in a car crash. The circumstances of his death, especially the technical details and the alleged financial benefits for third-parties, raised much speculation that he had been in fact murdered. His estate, including his majority stock, was inherited by his daughter, Ana-Maria, but her ownership was contested by the Iucinu family (his secret mistress and her son by Tinu). Their interests were defended in court by former panelist Andon, owner of some 2% of the stock. The editorial board's opposition to the administrative reshuffling proposed by Ana-Maria Tinu also created a lengthy conflict, and prevented her from assuming administrative control of the paper. It was alleged that, at the time of his death, Tinu was considering rebranding and restructuring, and that, in 2004, the newspaper's profits were only 9% of its total income. A major crisis took place in 2005, when Popescu resigned from the board and was followed by 50 of his colleagues, all of whom set up a new daily, G√¢ndul. In one of his last AdevƒÉrul pieces, titled Atacul guzganului rozaliu (\\"The Attack of the Pink Rat\\"), Popescu accused Hrebenciuc of having imposed his control on the newspaper during the local elections of 2004, when he allegedly pressured journalists not to criticize the PSD Mayor of BacƒÉu, Dumitru Sechelariu. Cristian Tudor Popescu, \\"Atacul guzganului rozaliu\\", in AdevƒÉrul, March 21, 2005 (republished by Hotnews.ro; retrieved April 18, 2009) Also according to Popescu, Hrebenciuc had urged him and his colleagues to feature more negative and less positive coverage of the PSD rival and Democratic Party candidate Traian BƒÉsescu during the presidential suffrage of November 2004. Atacul guzganului rozaliu also alleged that Ana-Maria Tinu had an understanding with the PSD politician, and her rebranding of AdevƒÉrul was Hrebenciuc's attempt to undermine its political independence. According to writer and analyst Cristian Teodorescu, the \\"pink rat\\" label stuck, and Hrebenciuc's influence on the newspaper suffered as a result. Although G√¢ndul attracted a large following during a number of months, turning a profit in the first month, AdevƒÉrul survived the shock. A similar crisis with similar outcomes had affected its rival Evenimentul Zilei in 2004, when the policies of new owners Ringier forced the resignation of editor Cornel Nistorescu and the migration of many staff members toward Cotidianul. Nicholson attributes the survival in both cases to the value of a well-established brand. In 2006, Ana-Maria Tinu sold her share of AdevƒÉrul Holding to one of Romania's richest entrepreneurs, the National Liberal politician Dinu Patriciu, her move hotly contested by Tinu's son Andrei Iucinu, who looked set to gain a third of the stock and trademark ownership upon the end of a trial. Mihai Vasilescu, \\"Megainvesti≈£ia lui Dinu Patriciu la AdevƒÉrul este √Æn pericol\\" , in Financiarul, February 10, 2009 Patriciu's decisions, including his appointment of a new managerial team, were resisted by Corina DrƒÉgotescu, who resigned and left the newspaper in November 2006. \\"Corina DrƒÉgotescu pƒÉrƒÉse≈üte AdevƒÉrul\\" , in Cotidianul, November 16, 2006 According to data made available by the Romanian Audit Bureau of Circulations, the newspaper's circulation for 2008 ranged between a minimum monthly average of 37,248 copies in January and a maximum one of 109,442 in December. AdevƒÉrul, at the Romanian Audit Bureau of Circulations; retrieved December 15, 2012 In 2009, the minimum was at 81,388 and the maximum at 150,061. A 2009 article in the rival newspaper Financiarul suggested that AdevƒÉrul was being neglected by Patriciu, who invested more in the holding (allegedly in hopes of undermining a trademark which he risked losing, while elevating the publications not affected by Iucinu's claim). However, by mid-2011, even as Romania's print media experienced major setbacks, the paper expanded in content and the holding enlarged its portfolio. Adrian Cioroianu, \\"Cum stƒÉ treaba cu Patriciu\\" , in Dilema Veche, Nr. 389, August 2011 Post-2000 editorial policy and controversies Despite the changes in attitude and management, some of the post-2000 editions of AdevƒÉrul remained controversial for their nationalist claims. This was primarily the case of statements it made in regard to the Romani minority, over which it has been repeatedly accused of antiziganism. In early 2002, the gazette reacted strongly against an advertisement for a soccer match between the Romanian squad and the French national team, where the former was being portrayed as a violinist.Berry, p.98 AdevƒÉrul saw this as an attempt to insult Romanians by associating them with Romani music, concluding: \\"Our French 'brothers' never stop offending us, and they seem to enjoy treating us like gypsies\\". A November 2008 article, which claimed to be based on a reportage piece first published in El Pa√≠s, depicted Romani Romanians as a leading demographic group within Madrid's organized crime networks.Valeriu Nicolae, \\"The Enemy Within. Roma, the Media and Hate Speech\\" , in Eurozine, March 20, 2009 Mircea Toma, \\"Halucina≈£ii etnice la AdevƒÉrul\\", in Academia Ca≈£avencu, December 24, 2008 The article was condemned by civil society observers, who uncovered that AdevƒÉrul had modified and editorialized the original piece, which actually spoke of the Romanian immigrant population, without any mention of ethnicity. An analysis made by researchers Isabela MerilƒÉ and Michaela Praisler found that, in contrast to Evenimentul Zilei, AdevƒÉrul had a socially conservative bias in reporting on the rise of Romanian hip hop, which it related to negative social phenomena (violence, drug use), and against which it favored a degree of censorship.Isabela MerilƒÉ, Michaela Praisler, \\"Textually Constructing Identity and Otherness: Mediating the Romanian Hip-Hop Message\\", in George McKay, Christopher Williams (eds.), Subcultures and New Religious Movements in Russia and East-Central Europe, Peter Lang AG, Bern, 2009, p.115, 120-123. Colec»õia AdevƒÉrul, the post-2008 book collection issued with the newspaper, has itself been at the center of a controversy. Two trials were opened on charges of plagiarism, after the collection issued works by Leo Tolstoy and VintilƒÉ Corbul, allegedly without respecting the authorship rights of original translators. Doinel Tronaru, \\"AdevƒÉrul ≈üi Jurnalul se bat pe Otilia\\" , in Evenimentul Zilei, April 24, 2009 Another such conflict was sparked in April 2009, opposing Colec»õia AdevƒÉrul to Biblioteca pentru to»õi (\\"Everyman's Library\\"), a similar book series issued by the rivals at Jurnalul Na»õional and Editura Litera. This came after AdevƒÉrul went ahead of Biblioteca pentru to»õi in reissuing George CƒÉlinescu's Enigma Otiliei novel. AdevƒÉrul Holding acuzƒÉ Antena 1 de \\"practici incorecte\\", Mediafax release, April 23, 2009; retrieved April 25, 2009 Institutul CƒÉlinescu ≈üi Litera Interna≈£ional vor sƒÉ dea √Æn judecatƒÉ AdevƒÉrul, Mediafax release, April 24, 2009; retrieved April 25, 2009 The Romanian Academy's George CƒÉlinescu Institute, which claims the copyright to CƒÉlinescu's books, joined Editura Litera in a lawsuit against AdevƒÉrul. In reply, AdevƒÉrul accused Jurnalul Na»õional itself of having usurped the Biblioteca pentru to»õi brand, previously owned by Editura Minerva. It also spoke out against Antena 1, a television station which, like Jurnalul Na»õional, is owned by Intact Group, accusing it of mudslinging. In the months leading up to the 2009 presidential election, AdevƒÉrul launched a special nation-wide advertising campaign, announcing that it was reducing to a minimum its coverage of the political scene and would not host campaign ads, directly appealing to people who were declaring themselves disgusted with the election process. The initiative was covered by journalist Gabriel Giurgiu in the cultural magazine Dilema Veche, which is also part of the AdevƒÉrul Holding. Giurgiu's article was a mixed review: it argued that the reaction was understandable, but \\"regrettable\\", because it carried the risk of glamorizing voter fatigue and depriving society of \\"a necessary burden.\\" Gabriel Giurgiu, \\"Regretabilul dezgust\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 297, October 2009 Hotnews.ro owner and columnist Dan TƒÉpalagƒÉ placed this stance in connection to Dinu Patriciu's publicized adversity toward incumbent President BƒÉsescu. In his view, Patriciu stood alongside Intact Group owner Dan Voiculescu and Realitatea-Ca»õavencu's Sorin Ovidiu V√¢ntu as one of the \\"media moguls\\" working to prevent BƒÉsescu' reelection. Alluding to the newspaper's promotional offers of cartoon classics on DVD and popular novels, TƒÉpalagƒÉ concluded: \\"[AdevƒÉrul] readers must be forcefully kept away from politics, perhaps kept busy with Tom and Jerry. Forcefully saturated of politics, the citizen in Patriciu's dreams gobbles up the personal governments concocted together with Voiculescu and V√¢ntu, reads approximate literature and watches animated cartoons.\\" Dan TƒÉpalagƒÉ, \\"Cum iau ziari≈ütii urma banilor, asmu≈£i≈£i de Patriciu si V√¢ntu\\", at Hotnews.ro, November 26, 2009; retrieved December 24, 2009 However, similar criticism of AdevƒÉrul was also voiced from within Realitatea-Ca»õavencu. Cornel Nistorescu, the new editor of Cotidianul, called the promotion \\"lobotomizing\\", and, contrary to TapalagƒÉ, suggested that it had been induced by President BƒÉsescu, to whom he attributed the power of ordering Patriciu's arrest on allegations of white-collar crime: \\"It is as if Traian BƒÉsescu had sent him the message: write one more line about me, and you'll be spending another week in the big house!\\" Cornel Nistorescu, \\"AdevƒÉrul ≈üi Patriciu fug de politicƒÉ\\" , in Cotidianul, October 20, 2009 Another Cotidianul contributor, Costi Rogozanu, referred to the AdevƒÉrul message as \\"a strange manipulation\\" and \\"a dangerous invitation to carelessness\\", noting that Romanian society was becoming divided between openly partisan media outlets and venues that avoided all mention of politics. Costi Rogozanu, \\"A-politicele AdevƒÉrul, TVR. ≈ûi cum ne-am transformat √Æn Romamerik?\\", at Hotnews.ro, November 13, 2009; retrieved December 24, 2009 Additionally, the newspaper became focused on exploring the history of Romanian communism, and ran exposes on the Ceau»ôescu family. This interest (seen by Rogozanu as obsessive) was criticized as sensationalist, particularly after AdevƒÉrul circulated claims that the former dictator had been a youthful homosexual. Adrian Cioroianu, \\"Sexualitatea lui Ceau≈üescu sau manelizarea istoriei\\" , in Dilema Veche, Nr. 394, September 2011 2011 crisis Several months after the elections, in mid-2010, the issue of editorial policies came up again, as a group of panelists walked out from the daily, citing worries that Dinu Patriciu was imposing his own agenda. Although initially supportive of this move, some, most notably Grigore Cartianu, Ovidiu Nahoi and Adrian Halpert, revised their decision and stayed on with AdevƒÉrul. Alina VƒÉtƒÉman, \\"Cartianu s-a rƒÉzg√¢ndit: rƒÉm√¢ne la AdevƒÉrul\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, June 24, 2010 Under new management, AdevƒÉrul also acquired a new core group of columnists, including Patriciu himself. The owner's opinion pieces illustrate his commitment to libertarianism and the free market, which have little echo inside his own National Liberal Party. \\"Dinu Patriciu vrea un nou partid: Puterea ≈üi Opozi≈£ia s√Ænt la fel de impotente. Solu≈£ia, o mi≈ücare politicƒÉ nouƒÉ ≈üi pragmaticƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22 online edition, May 20, 2011; Vlad Macovei, \\"Are ≈üi Dinu Patriciu dreptatea lui!\\", in Evenimentul Zilei, July 18, 2011 The other authors stood for a wide range of opinions, including anti-Patriciu stances. In February 2011, AdevƒÉrul even hosted an extended political debate between Patriciu and another columnist, the former cabinet minister and BƒÉsescu advisor Andrei Ple»ôu. Vlad Stoicescu, \\"PolemicƒÉ Ple≈üu- Patriciu: 'Dinule, am vƒÉzut √Æn jurul tƒÉu oameni fa≈£ƒÉ de care Liiceanu e un √Ænger' \\", in Evenimentul Zilei, February 23, 2011 In December, Ple»ôu gave up his column in AdevƒÉrul, citing the accumulated frustration of working under an (unnamed) editor.

The effects of global crisis were felt throughout Romanian mass-media, putting a check on AdevƒÉrul growth, and stabilizing its circulation at some 30,000 copies per issue.Iulian Comanescu, \\"C√Ænd presa a fost subiect de ≈ütiri\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 412: Dosar: Anul Vechi, January 2012 An advertising campaign for the newspaper, managed through Patriciu's firm Odyssey Communication, failed to reverse that trend, and Odyssey itself registered for bankruptcy.

Chronology  Hudson gave birth to a son with an unknown father on September 25, 2004, at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, Texas, with thanatophoric dysplasia, a typically fatal form of congenital dwarfism. She was informed that the infant was most likely unable to survive, and should have his breathing tube removed pursuant to Chapter 166 of the Texas Health & Safety Code, the Advance Directives Act. Under this act, a doctor's recommendations to withdraw medical treatment can be followed, after they have been reviewed by the hospital's ethics committee and after 10 days' notice is given to the patient or guardian. Hudson was given 10 days from written notice to find a new facility to accommodate the infant, but was unable to do so. Texas Children's Hospital states that it attempted to contact 40 facilities without finding a willing one. Legal delays prevented the removal of the breathing tube, which would have occurred on November 28, 2004, but a judge ruled that the removal of the tube did not require Hudson's agreement. On March 15, 2005, Texas Children's Hospital personnel removed the breathing tube. Official reports state that he was sedated, and asphyxiated in under a minute. Hudson disputes this, and told reporters, who were not permitted entrance, \\"I wanted y'all to see my son for yourself, so you could see he was actually moving around. He was conscious.\\" The hospital lacked confidence in Hudson's mental competence; she was quoted by The Dallas Morning News as saying that she didn't seek prenatal care \\"because I trusted in the Sun\\", which she claimed fathered the baby. She also made similar comments during an interview with Greta Van Susteren. Bioethics implications Bioethicists note that the case is the first time a U.S. hospital has been allowed to remove life sustaining support contrary to the wishes of the legal guardian and lacking advance directives from the patient themselves. This, the bioethicists claim, makes the issue precedent-setting in further cases where it may be applied. Early speculation as to its application was the case of Spiro Nikolouzos. Nikolouzos, however, was accepted at a San Antonio nursing facility on March 21, 2005, where he died of natural causes on May 30. Comparisons to the Terri Schiavo case Critics of the federal government's involvement in the Terri Schiavo case, which culminated around the same time as the Sun Hudson case, pointed out that the Advance Directives Act was signed into law by George W. Bush, who was then Governor of Texas. In the Terri Schiavo case, family objections were considered paramount, whereas in the Sun Hudson case, evidence-based medical care was followed instead.

He became Great Secretary of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1580, Great Clerk of the Grand Duchy in 1581, Court Chancellor in 1585, Grand Chancellor from 1589 until 1623, Voivode of Vilnius in 1621, Great Lithuanian Hetman in 1623 and governor of Slonim, Brest and Mogilev. Sapieha is considered as a great political figure of the Commonwealth. A rich and powerful magnate, he was known for his wisdom as a statesman, lawyer and military commander, he was one of the greatest leaders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the times of the Duchy's highest cultural flourishing. He was of Ruthenian ethnicity. Modern Belarusian sources interpret his Ruthenian heritage as Belarusian, however many facts presented by the modern Belarusian sources about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania are often distorted and unanimously not recognized by Lithuanian and Polish historians.–°–∞–≤–µ—Ä—á–∞–Ω–∫–∞ –Ü.–í. –ö–∞–Ω—Ü–ª–µ—Ä –í—è–ª—ñ–∫–∞–≥–∞ –∫–Ω—è—Å—Ç–≤–∞. –õ–µ—û –°–∞–ø–µ–≥–∞, –ú–Ω., –ù–∞–≤—É–∫–∞ —ñ —Ç—ç—Ö–Ω—ñ–∫–∞, 1992, —Å.63.–ß–∞—Ä–æ–ø–∫–∞ –í. –ë–∞—Ü—å–∫–∞ –ê–π—á—ã–Ω—ã. –õ–µ—û –°–∞–ø–µ–≥–∞. —û –∫–Ω—ñ–∑–µ ¬´–£–ª–∞–¥–∞—Ä—ã –≤—è–ª—ñ–∫–∞–≥–∞ –∫–Ω—è—Å—Ç–≤–∞¬ª, –ú–Ω., –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—å, 1-–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ 1996, 2-–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ 2002, —Å.327-408.–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä: –¢–∞—Ä–∞—Å –ê. –ï, –í—è–ª—ñ–∫—ñ –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å –õ–µ—û –°–∞–ø–µ–≥–∞: –ó–±–æ—Ä–Ω—ñ–∫ –∞—Ä—Ç—ã–∫—É–ª–∞—û, 2012, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ: –Ü–Ω—Å—Ç—ã—Ç—É—Ç –±–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞–π –≥—ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—ñ i –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã http://library.by/portalus/modules/belarus/show_archives.php?subaction=showfull&id;=1290335803&archive;=1290362895&start;_from=&ucat;=8&http://samlib.ru/p/prokopchuk_artur_andreewich/msworddoc-15.shtmlhttp://nn.by/?c=ar&i;=70123 BiographyEarly life= He was born in Astro≈≠na (), near Vitebsk.http://jivebelarus.net/at_this_day/events_calendar262.html He was educated in Leipzig and worked in the royal chancellery of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stefan B√°thory under direction of Jan Zamoyski. Raised Eastern Orthodox, in his youth he converted to Calvinism and founded a number of Calvinist churches in his former estates. In the 1570s he turned to Unitarianism. Disillusioned by the squabbles within the Protestant camp, in 1586 he converted with his first wife to Roman Catholicism of which he became a zealous defender. After the Union of Brest he enforced conformity on the unwilling Eastern Orthodox. =Career and politics= He supported a political union with Muscovy in 1584‚Äì1600 and led the diplomatic mission to Moscow in 1600 that proposed the union to tzar Boris Godunov, who declined the proposal. He also participated in wars with Muscovy under rule of Stephen B√°thory and King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund III Vasa. He became an adviser of Sigismund III and supported his radical plans to take over the Muscovite throne and reclaim Smolensk by force. He participated in establishing the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1578. As Chancellor he was the main editor and publisher of the last version of the Statute of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He laid grounds for the establishment of the Law Faculty in the University of Vilnius, which was created in 1641. He was co-initiator and a participant in the military expedition to Moscow in 1618 by King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV. As Sejm Marshal he led the ordinary Sejm in Warsaw from October 4 to November 25, 1582. He was a benefactor of many catholic churches in the Grand Duchy. He established the long-term power and wealth of the Sapieha family. Sapieha died on 1633 and was interred in the cellars of the Church of St. Michael the Archangel in Vilnius, which he himself commissioned.Howard Jarvis, Neil Taylor (2006) Vilnius with Kaunas, Bradt Travel Guides, pp. 112‚Äì113 His tomb remains there to the present day and is still the largest piece of art of its kind in the territory of Lithuania.

The grouping is not universally recognized as valid.Salminen, Tapani 2002: Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies. http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html Related hypotheses The Mordvinic languages appear to also align closely with both Finnic and Samic. Some innovations in the consonant system are shared by Finnic and Mordvinic specifically, while a number of innovations in the vowel system are shared by Samic and Mordvinic specifically. The Mari language shows a smaller number of similarities with all three of these, and a larger grouping encompassing Finnic, Samic, Mordvinic and Mari is sometimes posited (the Finno-Volgaic languages). Helimski (2006) proposes a \\"Northwest\\" group of Finno-Ugric languages, encompassing not only Finnic and Sami, but also extinct languages once spoken in the north of European Russia, traceable only as substrata, especially in toponymy. Arguments for and against genetical unity The common ancestor of Finnic and Samic is traditionally known as Early Proto-Finnic (Finnish: varhaiskantasuomi). Its phonology and morphology can be reconstructed in great detail. However, this reconstruction turns out to be nearly identical to assumed preceding stages such as Proto-Finno- Volgaic, Proto-Finno-Ugric, and even Proto-Uralic itself. There are a number of noticeable traits common to most Finno-Samic languages, however none of them unquestionably in favor of a family unity. The first of these is the presence of consonant gradation, found in all of the languages except the marginal languages of the group, Livonian, Veps and Southern Sami. Gradation is also found in the distantly related Samoyedic Nganasan, and it has been debated if gradation is an original Uralic feature suppressed in all other branches, an independent innovation in Finno-Lappic and Nganasan, or independent in all three of Finnic, Samic and Nganasan. Also, even if gradation in Finnic and Samic is connected, it is disputed whether this represents common inheritance or later contact influence. The contrastive presence of rounded vowels beyond the first syllable, atypical of Uralic languages in general, is also found in both Finnic and Samic (and again also Samoyedic). This too has been argued to represent later contact influence, on the basis of comparisons such as F. : S. \\"maternal uncle\\", where the exclusively Finnic development > appears to have been loaned into Samic. There is also considerable disagreement between the languages (both between the two families, and within them) in whether certain words contain a rounded vowel. The loss of initial before a short rounded vowel has also been proposed as a common innovation, but with counterexamples such as Estonian v√µtta- \\"to take\\" (with preserved as its regular reflex due to the development > ) suggesting a date postdating not only the split between Finnic and Samic, but also of northern and southern Finnic (cf. Finnish otta-). (A complementary epenthesis of *w before initial long rounded vowels is accepted to not represent common inheritance, as it occurs also before long vowels resulting from the exclusively Samic development > . ) For morphological features common to Samic and Finnic formerly thought to represent Finno-Samic innovations, explanations have likewise been offered either of common Uralic inheritance or of independent innovation. =Lexicon= Approximately 600 native word roots are shared by the Finnic and Samic languages, of which approximately 100 lack cognates in the other Uralic languages. The high number of Finnic loanwords in Samic makes exact analysis however difficult, and old loanwords from Samic to Finnic may also be involved, especially in light of approximately a third of these words being absent also from the more southern Finnic languages (Estonian, Livonian and Votic). These numbers can be contrasted with ca. 40 word roots exclusive to Finnic and Mordvinic, 12 word roots exclusive to Samic and Mordvinic, and 22 word roots exclusive to all three. Additionally a large number of early loanwords from the Germanic languages, and a small number from the Baltic languages, are found in both Finnic and Samic. Such words cannot however provide clear evidence for a Finno-Samic grouping, as the possibility remains that these have been acquired separately by early Finnic and early Samic, after their initial separation but prior to the development of their most distinctive features.

Often the driver is separated from the rear passengers by a division, as with a limousine. During the first half of the 20th century, taxicabs were often landaulets, with models such as the Austin 12/4 and the Checker Model G and early Checker Model A being a common sight in larger cities.

It was replaced with the Model Rules of Professional Conduct in 1983 for a number of reasons, especially the Watergate scandal.Theodore Schneyer, \\"Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code,\\" in Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession, eds. Robert L. Nelson, David M. Trubek, & Rayman L. Solomon, 95‚Äì143 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), 104. The Code was also subject to widespread criticism from bench and bar that it was structurally flawed, difficult to understand, hard to obey, and impossible to enforce. The Code consisted of Canons, Ethical Considerations, and Disciplinary Rules, of which the first two were aspirational and only the third was mandatory. This forced judges and lawyers to sort through a maze of Canons and Ethical Considerations just to understand the Disciplinary Rule that controlled a particular ethical issue. During a key debate in late January 1982 over whether to replace the Model Code with the Model Rules, one delegate \\"referred to the nine canons, 129 ethical considerations and forty-three disciplinary rules as a three-dimensional chess game that lawyers played at their own peril.\\"Center for Professional Responsibility, A Legislative History: The Development of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, 1982-2005 (Chicago: American Bar Association, 2006), xiii-xiv. The American legal community demanded simple bright-line rules that its members could quickly read, comprehend, and follow. In response, the Model Rules consists simply of Rules. According to the Code's Preface, it was derived from the ABA's Canons of Professional Ethics (1908), which in turn were borrowed from the Canons of the Alabama State Bar (1887), which in turn were inspired by several sources such as ethics resolutions in an 1830s legal textbook. The U.S. state of New York was the last state using the Code for many years, long after all other states‚Äìexcept California and Maine‚Äìhad adopted the Model Rules.Press Release: New Attorney Rules of Professional Conduct Announced, Communications Office of the New York Courts, 17 December 2008. On December 17, 2008, the administrative committee of the New York courts announced that it had adopted a heavily modified version of the Model Rules, effective April 1, 2009. New York's version of the Model Rules was created by adjusting the standard Model Rules to reflect indigenous New York rules that had been incorporated over the years into its version of the Model Code. Even though New York did not adopt the Model Rules verbatim, the advantage of adopting its overall structure is that it simplifies the professional responsibility training of New York lawyers, and makes it easier for out-of-state lawyers to conform their conduct to New York rules by simply comparing their home state's version of the Model Rules to New York's version.

The lyrics were written in December 1935 and are usually credited to the leader of the Falange, Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera. The music was composed by Juan Teller√≠a and Juan R. Buendia. The circumstances of its creation are unusual. The Falangists needed a stirring song of their own to counter the popular appeal of El Himno de Riego (the official anthem of the Second Spanish Republic) and A las Barricadas (a very popular Anarchist song). To solve the problem, Primo de Rivera formed a committee meeting on 2 December 1935 in the home of Marichu de la Mora Maura. Those present included Jos√© Mar√≠a Alfaro, Rafael S√°nchez Mazas, Agust√≠n de Fox√°, Pedro Mourlane Michelena, Dionisio Ridruejo, Agust√≠n Aznar, and Luis Aguilar. The result of their efforts, following a period of sub-committee review (at the Cueva del Orkompon, a Basque bar in Calle Miguel Moya, Madrid) was provisionally entitled the Himno de Falange Espa√±ola. It was first performed in a rally at the Cine Europa of Madrid on February 2, 1936. The music was based on a 1935 piece by Juan Teller√≠a, Amanecer en Cegama (\\"Dawn at Zegama\\") The song was registered with number 75 027 between 1936 and 1937 with the lyrics at the name of Juan Ruiz de la Fuente. Its popularity was boosted by Primo de Rivera's execution on 20 November 1936 and his subsequent glorification by the Spanish Nationalists. During the Spanish Civil War the Falange, which was since its inception quite military or paramilitary, like other equivalent youth parties in countries under totalitarian regimes, became an important part of the National Army (or National Movement), both ideologically and militarily, still as an independent organization but strengthening the regular insurgent army in the combat lines, which caused plenty of Falangist casualties, and Cara al sol was their anthem throughout \\"the war days\\", the lyrics acquiring an even more special signification for its remembering of the \\"fallen comrades\\". In Francoist Spain, the Falange was merged with other far- right groups to form the \\"Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS\\", the only legal political party. Cara al Sol became a canto nacional (\\"national song\\") together with the Oriamendi, the hymn of the Carlist movement, and the anthem of the Spanish Legion, often played alongside the official anthem, the Marcha Granadera, and was regarded as the battle song of the Spanish far right. A decree from 1942 orders that, in official events, the national songs must be saluted with a Roman salute or, in exclusively military events, a military salute. Since the Spanish transition to democracy, the song has frequently been played at far-right rallies.  The lyrics  Cara al sol con la camisa nueva Que t√∫ bordaste en rojo ayer, Me hallar√° la muerte si me lleva Y no te vuelvo a ver. Formar√© junto a los compa√±eros Que hacen guardia sobre los luceros, Impasible el adem√°n, y est√°n Presentes en nuestro af√°n. Si te dicen que ca√≠, Me fui al puesto que tengo all√≠. Volver√°n banderas victoriosas Al paso alegre de la paz Y traer√°n prendidas cinco rosas: Las flechas de mi haz. Volver√° a re√≠r la primavera, Que por cielo, tierra y mar se espera.

Spain, great! Spain, free! Onward (arise) Spain! =Written by committee= The lyrics were a collaborative effort, under the editorship of Primo de Rivera. Authorship of individual lines are attributed as follows: 1-4 Fox√°, Primo de Rivera, Alfaro; 5-10 Fox√°; 11-12 Ridruejo; 13-14 Primo de Rivera; 15 Alfaro; 16 Mourlane; and 17-18 Alfaro. Lines 19-22 were existing Falange slogans. =Imagery in the lyrics= *Line 1: The reference to the \\"new shirt\\" relates to the Falangist uniform, a working-class, plain blue shirt which was their most distinctive sign and was embroidered upon the heart position in the left side of the chest with the party symbol in red colour, a yoke uniting in its center an array of five arrows pointing upwards, meaning strength, sacrifice and union. *Lines 13-14: The reference to the arrows is an allusion to the Falange \\"Yoke and Arrows\\" symbol and to the Falangist youth movement. *Lines 19-21 Espa√±a Una, Grande y Libre was a frequently used slogan in Francoism. The lyrics incorporated a version of a chant that was very common at Falangist/Francoist rallies. *Line 22: Falangists use Arriba Espa√±a (\\"Arise Spain\\" or \\"Onward Spain\\") instead of the more mainstream Viva Espa√±a (\\"Long live Spain\\"). =Alternate lines= In Line 5, mis compa√±eros (\\"my companions\\") is sometimes replaced by los compa√±eros (\\"the companions\\") or otros compa√±eros (\\"other companions\\").  \\"Amanecer\\" ballad version  This version of the song appeared after the civil war, and is a slow-motion version of \\"Cara al Sol\\", sometimes sung by a female voice, almost a ballad.

It is down the line from and is situated between and stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 5, and the station and all trains are operated by Southeastern. History The station was originally named Chislehurst and Bickley Park when it was first opened on 1 July 1865: the South Eastern Railway had opened part of its cut- off line to Dover on that date. On 2 March 1868 a new station was opened south of the original on completion of the cut-off to Tonbridge. At the beginning of the 20th century the tracks through the station were quadrupled. Beyond Elmstead Woods station (opened in 1904) to the north of Chislehurst lie the Chislehurst Tunnels, a tunnel each on the slow lines [649 yd (584 m)] and fast lines [591 yd (532 m)]. To the south of the station the Up and Down Chatham Loop lines give access to the Chatham Main Line where the next station is St Mary Cray. There are normally no direct trains between Chislehurst and St Mary Cray, as trains that use the connecting curves usually run non-stop between London Bridge and either Rochester or West Malling. When engineering work takes place on the South Eastern Main Line, services from London to Ashford International or Hastings call additionally at Chislehurst, using Class 375 units. These services are diverted onto the Chatham Main Line and run via Swanley and Otford. =Chislehurst Caves= The station is very close to Chislehurst Caves, former mines than were used as an air raid shelter during World War II. The close proximity of the station saw thousands of people at one point disembark at the station to enter the shelter. Connections London Buses routes 162 and 269 serve the station.  Service  The typical off peak service in trains per hour is: * 2 tph to London Charing Cross (fast from to London Bridge) * 2 tph to London Cannon Street via Lewisham (all station) * 4 tph to of which 2 continue to Long distance services to , and call occasionally at Chislehurst during periods of engineering work.

Direct drive mechanisms can be categorized in groups (A) Torque motor mechanisms. Output shaft is driven either by brush torque motor or brushless torque motor. The brushless torque motor requires commutation. Battery driven devices such as cordless hand drills are generally use brush torque motors. (B) AC drives. Generally driven by 60 cycle voltage. Examples- turntables low speed, fans medium speed, hard drives high speed. The major alternative to direct drive mechanism is geared stepper motor mechanism driven by current pulses. Advantages * Increased efficiency: The power is not wasted in friction (from the belt, chain, etc., and especially, gearboxes.) * Reduced noise: Being a simpler device, a direct- drive mechanism has fewer parts which could vibrate, and the overall noise emission of the system is usually lower. * Longer lifetime: Having fewer moving parts also means do not have that things fewer parts prone to failure. Failures in other systems are usually produced by aging of the component (such as a stretched belt), or stress. * High torque at low rpm. * Faster and precise positioning. High torque and low inertia allows faster positioning times on permanent magnet synchronous servo drives. Feedback sensor directly on rotary part allows precise angular position sensing. * Drive stiffness. Mechanical backlash, hysteresis and elasticity is removed avoiding use of gearbox or ball screw mechanisms. Disadvantages The main disadvantage of the system is that it needs a special motor. Usually motors are built to achieve maximum torque at high rotational speeds, usually 1500 or 3000 rpm. While this is useful for many applications (such as an electric fan), other mechanisms need a relatively high torque at very low speeds, such as a phonograph turntable, which needs a constant (and very precise) 33 rpm or 45 rpm. The slow motor also needs to be physically larger than its faster counterpart. For example, in a belt-coupled turntable, the motor diameter is about . On a direct-drive turntable, the motor is about . Also, direct-drive mechanisms need a more precise control mechanism. High speed motors with speed reduction have relatively high inertia, which helps smooth the output motion. Most motors exhibit positional torque ripple known as cogging torque. In high speed motors, this effect is usually negligible, as the frequency at which it occurs is too high to significantly affect system performance; direct drive units will suffer more from this phenomenon, unless additional inertia is added (i.e. by a flywheel) or the system uses feedback to actively counter the effect. Applications Direct drive mechanisms are present in several products: =High-speed= * Fans: Imprecise, depending on the fan, between 1000 and 21000 rpm. * Hard drives: Very precise, 5400, 7200, 10000, 15000 rpm and others. * VCR heads: Very precise, 1800 rpm (NTSC) or 1500 rpm (PAL). * Sewing machines: 3000 rpm to 5000 rpm depending on machine type. * Turn tables: CNC machines with fast and precise turning tables * Washing machines: up to 1600 rpm spin speeds =Medium or variable= * Floppy disk drives * CD drives: the CD is directly coupled to the rotor; 250 to 500 rpm for audio, higher speeds in portable and computer drives. =Very low rotational speeds= * Phonograph turntables: Very precise, 78, 33 and 45 rpm. * Telescope mount: Very precise, e.g. 1 revolution in 24 h. *Ski lift drive: up to 30 rpm depending upon line speed. =Other uses= * Washing machines: Various manufacturers, including Ar√ßelik, Fisher & Paykel, LG, Samsung, Whirlpool and Toshiba have released washing machines where the drum is driven directly by the motor, replacing the usual noisy and less efficient belt or gearbox-driven system. * Railway vehicles: The Milwaukee Road class EP-2 electric locomotives introduced in 1919 had the driving wheels mounted directly to the traction motor shafts. East Japan Railway Company (JR East) built an experimental E993 series electric multiple-unit (EMU) called the \\"AC Train\\" in January 2002 to test the feasibility of direct-drive motors on commuter trains. The technology was later incorporated in the E331 series EMU which entered service on the Keiy≈ç Line in 2007. * Road vehicles: Wheel hub motors date to the late 19th century, and used in modern (2000s) electric vehicle concepts * Wind turbines (see Gearless wind turbines): Various companies have developed direct drive generators for wind turbines, which are designed to improve efficiency and decrease maintenance costs. * Cycles: Some cycle types e.g. unicycles, penny-farthings, and children's tricycles. * Racing wheel controllers for video games  See also  * Hubless wheel * Linear motor  References  Category:Mechanisms (engineering) Category:Gearless electric drive ","title":"Direct-drive mechanism"},{"id":"1631295","text":"International standard ISO 1000 (SI units and recommendations for the use of their multiples and of certain other units, International Organization for Standardization, 1992) is the ISO standard describing the International System of Units (SI).

Such creatures are reported as being much larger than the commonly accepted New World monkeys. These accounts have received rather little publicity, and typically generated little or no interest from experts. Older reports and sightings Perhaps the first formal record of such creatures called \\"marimondas\\" or \\"maribundas\\" comes from 1533, when Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n reported sightings from natives and from one Spanish settler. In his writings, Sir Walter Raleigh made brief note of reports of large monkey-like creatures in South America. He did not see such a creature himself, but deemed them credible, noting the ubiquity and consistency of reports. The German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who travelled in South America during early 19th century, heard stories from Orinoco about furry human-like creatures called Salvaje (\\"Wild\\"), which according to Humboldt were rumoured to capture women, build huts and to occasionally eat human flesh. He states that both the native people and the missionaries in the area believed in these stories. However, the Humboldt recognized similar myths from the Old World, and concluded that the stories had entered into South America from the Europeans. The naturalist Philip Gosse also tried to examine these legends during his travels in Venezuela during the mid-19th century, but with no real success (Sj√∂gren, 1980). Modern reports and sightings The so-called Loys' Ape was photographed in 1920; it has since been identified as a spider monkey. In 1931, inspired by Loys' ape, three Italians made an expedition to the Mazaruni River in Guyana, but without further evidence than more alleged sightings from the residents. Bengt Sj√∂gren writes (1980) that: \\"They returned home with a couple of eyewitness-reports, that give the impression that the interviewed tried to make fun of them.\\" An American millionaire also set up a reward of 50,000 dollars to the one who could find a specimen, but nobody seems to have claimed the reward. The American scientist Philip Herschkowitz, who traveled in the same areas as de Loys, concluded that the story was a myth whose origin was the spider monkey, Ateles belzebuth. However, in 1951, a Frenchman named Roger Courteville claimed to have seen an apeman at the same Tarra River where de Loys said he had seen his creatures. Like de Loys, he presented a photograph of the creature as evidence. According to Sj√∂gren (1980) the photo was a hoax, a manipulated version of de Loys photograph. In 1987, Gary Samuels (a mycologist studying under a grant from the New York Botanical Garden) was studying fungi in Guyana. Hearing footsteps nearby, he glanced up, expecting to see his Guyanese assistant. Instead, he saw a bipedal, ape-like creature standing about five feet tall. Samuels said the creature bellowed at him, then ran away. Criticism As mentioned above, Humboldt considered the reports of Salvaje to be just myths that came to South America with European colonists. The Swedish author Rolf Blomberg speculates (1966) that rumours of hidden monsters in the Amazon basin might have been inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Lost World (1912) combined with exaggerated reports of sightings of unusually large spider monkeys (Sj√∂gren, 1980), and Bengt Sj√∂gren (1962) remarked: \\"For critically educated zoologists is of course all this 'ape mystery' just a good joke\\". Beyond humans, hominids (Hominoidea) are restricted to the Old World, while the New World is populated by smaller, often arboreal monkeys with long tails and flatter noses (Platyrrhini). Consequently, there is little evolutionary and biogeographical reason to expect a hominid primate hiding in the jungles of South America (Sj√∂gren, 1980).

This type of cataloging has mostly been supplanted by computerization. A hand-written American index card. A ruled index card An index card (or record card in British English and system cards in Australian English) consists of card stock (heavy paper) cut to a standard size, used for recording and storing small amounts of discrete data. A collection of such cards either serves as, or aids the creation of, an index for expedited lookup of information (such as a library catalog or a back-of-the-book index). This system was invented by Carl Linnaeus,Carl Linnaeus Invented The Index Card ScienceDaily, June 16, 2009 around 1760.Staffan M√ºller-Wille, Sara Scharf Indexing Nature: Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) and his Fact-Gathering Strategies University of Exeter & University of Toronto, 2009, p. 4  Format  The most common size for index card in North America and the UK is , hence the common name 3-by-5 card. Other sizes widely available include , and ISO-size A7 (). Cards are available in blank, ruled and grid styles in a variety of colors. Special divider cards with protruding tabs and a variety of cases and trays to hold the cards are also sold by stationers and office product companies. They are part of standard stationery and office supplies all around the globe.  Uses  Index cards are used for a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes (see Zettelkasten). Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced by indexing software in the 1980s and 1990s. An often suggested organization method for bibliographical use is to use the smaller 3-inch by 5-inch cards to record the title and citation information of works cited, while using larger cards for recording quotes or other data. Index cards are used for many events and are helpful for planning. History Carl Linnaeus invented the index card in order to help deal with the information overload facing early scientists that occurred from oversees discoveries. Linnaeus had to deal with a conflict between needing to bring information into a fixed order for purposes of later retrieval, and needing to integrate new information into that order permanently. His solution was to keep information on particular subjects on separate sheets, which could be complemented and reshuffled. In the mid 1760s Linnaeus refined this into what we call index cards. Index cards could be selected and moved around at will to update and compare information at any time. Until the digitization of library catalogs, which began in the 1980s, the primary tool used to locate books was the card catalog, in which every book was described on three cards, filed alphabetically under its title, author, and subject (if non-fiction). Similar catalogs were used by law firms and other entities to organize large quantities of stored documents. However, the adoption of standard cataloging protocols throughout nations with international agreements, along with the rise of the Internet and the conversion of cataloging systems to digital storage and retrieval, has made obsolescent the widespread use of index cards for cataloging. The first early modern card index was designed by Thomas Harrison (ca 1640s). Harrison's manuscript on The Ark of StudiesThomas Harrison, The Ark of Studies. Ed. by Alberto Cevolini. Turnhout: Brepols, 2017 (Arca studiorum) was edited and improved by Vincent Placcius in his well-known handbook on excerpting methods (De arte excerpendi, 1689). Using cards to create an index was the brainchild of 18th-century naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who is known as \\"the father of modern taxonomy\\" for his work on categorizing species. For organizing data, he needed a system for that was expandable and able to be rearranged easily; so he kept each datum on an individual sheet, and could add new sheets and reorganize simply. Card catalogs as currently known arose in the 19th century, and Melvil Dewey standardized the index cards used in library card catalogs in the 1870s. In the late 1890s, edge-notched cards were invented, which allowed for easy sorting of data by means of a needle-like tool. These edge-notched cards were phased out in the 1980s in favor of computer databases, and they are no longer sold. Kardex index card filing system James Rand, Sr.'s Rand Ledger Company (founded 1898) with its Visible Ledger system, and his son James Rand, Jr.'s American Kardex dominated sales of index card filing systems worldwide through much of the 20th century. \\"Kardex\\" became a common noun, especially in the medical records field where \\"filing a kardex\\" came to mean filling out a patient record on an index card. Vladimir Nabokov wrote his works on index cards, a practice mentioned in his work Pale Fire.

It is the tallest predictable geyser known. It was named by Dr. F.V. Hayden in 1871. Eruptions Grand's fountain reaches a height of as much as , with a duration of 9 to 12 minutes. Its eruptions occur in a series of 1 to 4 (rarely as many as 5) bursts. Sequence Grand erupts every 7 to 15 hours. It belongs to the Grand Group (or Grand Geyser Complex), and its eruption is connected to those of the other geysers in the group, especially the adjacent Vent Geyser and Turban Geyser. For a few hours before an eruption by Grand, Turban Geyser erupts for a duration of five minutes about every 17 to 22 minutes. Grand's eruption begins within 1 to 2 minutes of the start of one of Turban's eruptions, with Vent Geyser erupting shortly after Grand starts erupting. On occasion, Grand will stop erupting after 7 to 9 minutes, only to restart with a usually taller fountain a minute or two later. Grand has been known to rarely experience over half a dozen restarts in a single eruption period. After Grand ceases its eruption, Vent and Turban can continue to erupt for another hour. As of 2018, Grand Geyser has become extremely predictable, with nearly every eruption being 6-7 hours apart.

It was preceded by the Common Lectionary, assembled in 1983, itself preceded by the COCU Lectionary, published in 1974 by the Consultation on Church Union (COCU). This lectionary was derived from various Protestant lectionaries in current use, which in turn were based on the 1969 Ordo Lectionum Missae, a three-year lectionary produced by the Roman Catholic Church following the reforms of the Second Vatican Council.  Origin  The Revised Common Lectionary was the product of a collaboration between the North American Consultation on Common Texts (CCT) and the International English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC). After a nine-year trial period, it was publicly released in 1994. The CCT membership includes the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as many traditionally liturgical American and Canadian Protestant churches, including Lutheran, North American Anglican (Episcopal), Presbyterian, and (more loosely) Methodist. The CCT thereby represents the majority of American and Canadian Christians and has been widely adopted in Great Britain and in other countries such as Australia. Various churches, however, have made some changes to the form of the RCL that they use. It has been further adapted for Sunday school and children's church use. As in its predecessors, readings are prescribed for each Sunday: a passage typically from the Old Testament (including in Roman Catholic and Episcopal/Anglican Churches those books sometimes referred to as the Apocrypha or deuterocanonical books), or the Acts of the Apostles; a passage from one of the Psalms; another from either the Epistles or the Book of Revelation; and finally a passage from one of the four Gospels. Also like its predecessors, it runs in three-year cycles; the gospel readings in the first year (Year A) are taken from the Gospel of Matthew, those in the second year (or Year B) from the Gospel of Mark, and in the third year (or Year C) come from the Gospel of Luke. Portions of the Gospel of John are read throughout Eastertide, and are also used for other liturgical seasons including Advent, Christmastide, and Lent where appropriate. * Year A begins on the first Sunday of Advent in 2016, 2019, 2022, etc. * Year B begins on the first Sunday of Advent in 2017, 2020, 2023, etc. * Year C begins on the first Sunday of Advent in 2018, 2021, 2024, etc. It differs from its Latin predecessor, however, in that--as a result of feedback collected from the participating churches during the trial period--a greater emphasis is given to Old Testament passages and to Wisdom literature.  Scripture usage  The major principle behind the lectionary is that on a Sunday members of congregations should be able to hear the voice of each writer week by week, rather than readings being selected according to a theme. Thus, in any given year the writer of one of the first three gospels will be heard from beginning to end. Likewise the rest of the New Testament is heard, in some cases, virtually in total, in others in large part. This principle is subject to a number of exceptions. Firstly, different principles apply during the special seasons of the year: Advent, Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, and Easter. Here appropriate lections relevant to the season are chosen. The rest of the year, called Ordinary Time, begins in February (after Candlemas) and runs until the Second Sunday before Lent. It then resumes after Pentecost until the Sunday before Advent which is kept as the Feast of Christ the King. Secondly, because the cycle is three years long, only three of the Gospel writers are given a year. St John's Gospel, whose form and character is very different from the three synoptic gospels is treated differently and is inserted into all three years. Thus passages from St John appear in the special seasons of Advent and Lent, on Passion (Palm) Sunday in all three years, throughout Holy Week, including Good Friday, on Easter Day as the first alternative Gospel, during most of the Easter season, on Pentecost and during the year in which St Mark's gospel is in use. A practical reason for this is that Mark is considerably shorter than either St Matthew or St Luke. The treatment given to the Old Testament provides a further qualification to the first principle. Because it is so much longer than the New, it is inevitable that a smaller proportion of the material will be included, unless readings are to be very long. Readings are much more selective both in terms of the books included: little appears from the books of Leviticus and Numbers and almost none from 1 and 2 Chronicles. Moreover, it was decided that churches could choose between two tracks in their use of the Old Testament. \\"Track 1\\" adheres to the principle of giving the Biblical writer his own voice, thus following week by week from a portion of a book, or, in the case of some books, the whole. \\"Track 2\\", on the other hand, designated the \\"Related Track\\", is intended to relate in some way to the Gospel for the day. Provision is made for the use of a responsorial psalm each Sunday. Lastly, there has been a certain amount of editing so that some verses of most books are omitted. Sometimes the omission is simply an introduction to a book; sometimes more substantial material has been excluded, but the overall intention, that of allowing, say, the substance of a biblical writer's thoughts to be read and heard in church, has arguably been achieved at least more substantially than before. There have been arguments over individual editorial judgements and the Church of England, in its use of the RCL, has re-inserted verses, in brackets, which were felt by its Liturgical Commission to be more properly included. Such is the length of the Scriptural canon that no Sunday lectionary can cover the whole of Scripture without the necessity of very long readings on a Sunday or a longer cycle of years. Sometimes there has to be a choice between telling a long story or omitting it entirely. However, the daily lectionary, devised by the Roman Catholic Church and adopted by the Church of England (among others), provides more material. CCT has also produced a volume of daily readings. The Church of England has augmented the RCL by the provision of readings for second and third services. Thus the RCL lectionary is used for the \\"Principal Service\\", which often takes the form of a Eucharist, while allowing for additional material at other services which may be Morning and Evening Prayer (though provision is made for either being a Eucharist). Minimal changes to the \\"Principal Service\\" have been made in order to preserve its use as an ecumenical lectionary; the most significant of these is in Year B where in Epiphany for three Sundays readings from Revelation replace readings from 1 Corinthians.  Denominational practices  The Revised Common Lectionary is used in its original or an adapted form by churches around the world. The Ordo Lectionum Missae, on which it is based, is used in the Roman Catholic Church in local translations as the standard lectionary. Various other churches have also adopted (and sometimes adapted) the RCL; some may consider its use optional.

The most famously appears on the reconstructed Ishtar Gate of the city of Babylon, dating to the sixth century BCE.

It was primarily used by the Royal Navy on the Westland Lynx. The Royal Navy withdrew the missile from active service in 2017. Although the missile is intended for helicopter use, Kuwait employs it in a shore battery and on their Umm Al Maradem (Combattante BR-42) fast attack craft. Development Sea Skua ultimately traces its history to the immediate post-war era. Growing increasingly concerned about the threat of aircraft, especially after the introduction of glide bombs during the war, the Royal Navy had long been convinced that all ships required some form of surface-to-air missile (SAM). These systems tended to be relatively large, especially in the era before vertical launch, and it was difficult to mount both a useful SAM and a conventional gun on smaller ships. A gun was considered vital as the Navy's mission changed from one focused entirely on combat with the Soviet Union to the projection of power worldwide. This led to a series of experiments to produce a dual-use missile capable of both anti-air and anti-ship use. The original Navy guided missile sets, Seaslug and Seacat, both had secondary anti-shipping roles. Seaslug was a large system and could only be carried by larger ships, while Seacat could be fit to almost any ship but had a relatively short range and small warhead. Neither filled the goal of replacing guns. In October 1960 the Navy launched a project with the goal of producing a single weapon that could fit on a 3,000 ton frigate and able to attack bombers, anti-shipping missiles, and other ships up to frigate size. This led to the Small-Ship Guided Weapon and ultimately to Sea Dart. This system also proved too large for the smallest ships and the need remained unfilled. The sinking of the Eliat in 1967 led to the realization that small fast-attack boats were a serious immediate threat. A weapon was needed that could destroy any such craft before it could approach within the launching range of its missiles. Seacat did not have anywhere near the required range, Sea Dart did, but could not be fit to the majority of RN ships. A new conventional missile might be dedicated to the role, but it would have to be roughly the same size as those being aimed against it, which would take up too much room on a ship carrying many other weapons systems. Giving up on the original idea of having a dual-purpose weapon, the entire concept was reevaluated and led to the decision to launch the weapon from helicopters. This would allow a small weapon to have both the required range and warhead size. The missile would be carried by the new Westland Lynx and its targets detected by their Seaspray radar. Long range was not required, it only needed to be enough to keep the helicopter out of range of any anti-aircraft weapons the boats might carry. Its combat effectiveness was further improved by the addition of the Racal \\"Orange Crop\\" ECM suite, which allowed the helicopter to track the boats who were using radar to attempt to approach the ships, allowing the helicopters to approach without turning on their Seaspray until the last moment. The British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) began development in May 1972. The British Government authorised its production in October 1975. At the time, the missile was known as CL.834.Henry Stanhope Defence Correspondent. \\"Lightweight missile for Navy's new helicopters.\\" Times [London, England] 25 May 1972: 4. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 22 Nov. 2014. The first launches took place n November 1979 at the Aberporth Range in Cardigan Bay. Three missiles were launched from the ground and three by helicopters. Further tests were made and in July 1981, full-scale production was ordered of the new missile, now called \\"Sea Skua\\".Fischer, RiD Magazine, pp.68-69 Design Sea Skua missile With the missile weighing only at launch, a Lynx helicopter can carry up to four, two on each wing pylon. The booster is a Royal Ordnance (now Roxel UK) \\"Redstart\\" steel body, while the sustainer is a Royal Ordnance \\"Matapan\\" light alloy body. The missile flies at high subsonic speed to a range of up to . The official range is declared to be 15 km, but this is widely exceeded. The missile has two sensors: a semi-active radar homing system by Marconi Defence Systems, and a Thomson-TRT AHV-7 radar altimeter (which is also used by the Exocet missile), built under licence by British Aerospace Defence Systems. It can be set to travel at one of four pre- selected heights, depending on the surface conditions. Near the target, the missile climbs to a height at which it can \\"acquire\\" the target. The launching helicopter illuminates the target with its radar (originally the specially developed Ferranti Seaspray in the case of the Lynx), and the missile's homing head homes in on the reflected energy. On impact it penetrates the hull of a ship before detonating the blast fragmentation warhead. A semi armour piercing (SAP) warhead is also available; this contains of RDX, aluminium and wax. The fuze is an impact-delayed model. The illuminating radar aboard Lynx helicopters is the GEC-Ferranti Seaspray I band, which weighs , a power of 90 kW, two modes (three in the improved model) and a 90¬∞ observation field. The Seaspray Mk. 3 had a rotating antenna with a 360¬∞ field of view. It is capable of operating in a track while scan (TWS) mode. The missile flight ends after 75‚Äì125 seconds, during which time the helicopter can manoeuvre at up to 80¬∞ from the missile path. Service In addition to serving with the United Kingdom, the Sea Skua has been exported to Germany (where it will be replaced from 2012 onwards), India, Kuwait, and Turkey. It was generally preferred to the similar rival, the French-built AS 15 TT, even though the two missiles had similar performance. The guidance of AS-15TT was radio-command, and it required the Agrion 15 radar, unlike the more flexible British missile. Sea Skua's success in active service and its adoption by the Royal Navy resulted in considerable success in the international market.Fischer, RiD Magazine, pp.70-71 =Falklands War= Sea Skuas were launched eight times during the Falklands War, sometimes in extremely bad weather, and scoring a very high hit rate. Four were used against the 800 ton patrol boat/rescue tug ARA Alf√©rez Sobral, fired by two Lynx helicopters from HMS Coventry and HMS Glasgow. Two struck the patrol boat on the bridge, one hit the ship's fibreglass sea boat, and one passed over the ship. Extensive damage was inflicted and eight crewmen (including the captain) were killed, but the ship was not sunk and returned to Puerto Deseado. Another four Sea Skuas were used to destroy the wrecks of the cargo ship R√≠o Carcara√±√° (8,500 grt) and the patrol boat R√≠o Iguaz√∫. =First Gulf War= During the Gulf War, six naval Lynx helicopters were deployed to the Gulf on four frigates and destroyers of the Royal Navy. On 24 January 1991 one Lynx engaged and sank two Iraqi minesweepers near Qurah Island. A third was scuttled. A larger engagement took place on 29 January 1991. A force of seventeen Iraqi landing craft and escorting fast attack craft and minesweepers was detected moving south near Failaka island, as part of the Iraqi attack which resulted in the Battle of Khafji. Two vessels were sunk by Sea Skuas fired by four Lynx helicopters. The remaining vessels were damaged, destroyed or dispersed by American carrier-based aircraft and Royal Navy Sea King helicopters. The next day, another convoy of three Polnocny class landing ship, three TNC-45 fast attack craft (taken over by Iraq from the Kuwaiti Navy) and a single T-43 minelayer, was detected in the same area. Sea Skuas fired from four Lynx helicopters destroyed the three fast attack craft, and damaged the minesweeper and one landing ship; the landing ship was later destroyed by RAF Jaguars. During several engagements in February, Lynxes with Sea Skuas destroyed a Zhuk class patrol boat, a salvage vessel and another Polnocny class landing ship, and damaged another Zhuk patrol boat. =Royal Malaysian Navy service= The Sea Skua entered service with the Royal Malaysian Navy as part of the package for the purchase of six AgustaWestland Sea Lynx 300 helicopters. The missiles supposedly cost RM104 million. On 16 March 2006 the Royal Malaysian Navy test fired the Sea Skua missile as part of a contractual Firing exercise. The missile was fired eight miles down range from the 40m Surface Target Barge. The Sea Skua failed to hit its target and failed to explode. The fault was believed to have been traced to a faulty connecting pin wire that ignites the rocket motor. The missile fell into the sea, and was not recovered. The Royal Malaysian Navy ordered Matra Bae Dynamics (MBDA) to take back the missiles to conduct system checks, and re- tested. On 12 February 2008, the Royal Malaysian Navy successfully conducted a second firing. The missile was fired from maximum range and hit a surface target. Future Sea Skua is planned to be replaced in UK service by the Sea Venom. The Royal Navy conducted its final Sea Skua live firing in March 2017.

Nh3 This opening is also known as the Ammonia Opening, since NH3 is the chemical formula for ammonia. The Parisian amateur Charles Amar played it in the 1930s. It was probably named by Savielly Tartakower who used both names for this opening, although the chess author Tim Harding has jokingly suggested that \\"Amar\\" is an acronym for \\"Absolutely mad and ridiculous\\". Since 1.Nh3 is considered an irregular opening, it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. Assessment Like the Durkin Opening, White develops a knight to the edge of the board, where it does not control squares. Black's most common reply is 1...d5 which threatens 2...Bxh3, ruining White's pawn structure. White usually plays 2.g3 to prevent this, when Black can continue to occupy the center with 2...e5. World champion Magnus Carlsen used the Amar Opening to defeat Aleksey Dreev in a game played at rapid time controls in the 2018 online PRO Chess League.  Named variations  There are several named variations in the Amar Opening. The most well-known one is known as the Paris Gambit: 1.Nh3 d5 2.g3 e5 3.f4 Bxh3 4.Bxh3 exf4. In the Paris Gambit, White allows Black a firm grip on the center, and also gives up . Therefore, the gambit is considered dubious. The only named variation in the Paris Gambit is the Gent Gambit: 5.0-0 fxg3 6.hxg3. This variation was first played by Tartakower against Andor Lilienthal in Paris, 1933.

It is considered an irregular opening, and is classified under the code A00 (miscellaneous first moves by White) in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. Discussion Like Anderssen's Opening, 1.a3, 1.h3 is a time-wasting move, as it makes no claim on the central squares, nor does it aid development. It also leads to a slight weakening of White's kingside, albeit not as severely as Grob's Attack (1.g4) or Barnes Opening (1.f3). Since there is no need for White to make such a time-wasting first move, it is among the rarest of the 20 possible first moves. Nevertheless, IM Michael Basman has experimented with 1.h3, usually following it up with 2.g4 (transposing to the Grob), or 2.a3 followed by a quick c4, a line that has been dubbed the \\"Creepy Crawly\\". The ‚ÄúCreepy Crawly‚Äù is also known as the Global Opening. Black has a number of playable responses, the most common being 1...d5 and 1...e5, which stake out a claim for central space. Another response, 1...b6 (or even 1...b5), intends to fianchetto a bishop to pressure White's weakened pawns, and forestall a White kingside expansion with g2‚Äìg4. 1...f5 is probably not Black's best reply to 1.h3, since White can then play 2.d4, transposing to a sharp line against the Dutch Defense once tried by Viktor Korchnoi.

Description White's 1.d3 releases his c1-bishop and makes a modest claim for the centre, but since it does not stake out as large a share of the centre as 1.d4 does, it is not a popular opening move.

The group was the foundation of what would become the modern Deschapelles Chess Club in Boston. Chess career Ware was an avid tournament player and played in the Second International Chess Tournament,Second International Chess Tournament, Vienna 1882 at Chessbase.com Vienna 1882, the finest chess tournament of its time. He finished in sixteenth place of eighteen scoring a total of 11 points out of 34, but he did beat Max Weiss and the winner of the tournament, Wilhelm Steinitz in a game lasting 113 moves.Ware's winning game against Steinitz at Chessgames.com At the time, Steinitz had not lost or drawn a game for nine years prior to this tournament and was the unofficial World Champion. Ware also competed in the first, second, fourth and fifth American Chess Congresses. Legacy Ware's other claim to fame was his eccentric opening play. He used the Ware Opening (then known as the Meadow Hay Opening), the Corn Stalk Defence (sometimes known as the Ware Defence), and the Stonewall Attack. Around 1888 he reintroduced the Stone-Ware Defence to the Evans Gambit, 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3 Bd6!?, named after Ware and Henry Nathan Stone (1823‚Äì1909). (It had originally been played by Alexander McDonnell against Bertrand-Fran√ßois Mah√© de La Bourdonnais in 1843.)

Dr. McGinnis was appointed Dean of the Divisional Biological Sciences on July 1, 2013. He received his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley in 1982 and was a Jane Coffin Childs postdoctoral fellow at the University of Basel. From 1984 to 1995, he was on the faculty of Yale University. He received a Searle Scholar Award, a Presidential Young Investigator Award, and a Dreyfuss Teacher/Scholar Award. Dr. McGinnis was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010, and the National Academy of Sciences in 2019. Research McGinnis studies the evolutionary changes in transcription factors by looking at the Hox genes. His main research has been in Drosophila, comparing Hox genes within that species with Hox genes in other species, to see they are conserved (kept intact) during evolution. He also studies how Hox transcription functions control morphogenesis, and how changes in the Hox proteins, cofactors, and DNA targets affect morphology. One long term objective of the research in his lab is to understand the molecular interactions that underlie functional specificity in the Hox patterning system. McGinnis is notable for his co-discovery of homeobox, with Michael S. Levine. But importantly, for the discovery that Hox (homeobox) genes were found in vertebrates and a wide variety of animals, conserved, and were expressed in different regions of the vertebrate embryonic body axis, and that mammal Hox genes could function as anterior-posterior embryonic regulators of body axis specification, in flies as well as mammals. That is, Hox gene functions were similar in controlling body axis patterning in both flies and other more complicated animals, such as mammals.

After completing his Ph.D under Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology, Meselson became a Professor at Harvard University in 1960, where he has remained, today, as Thomas Dudley Cabot Professor of the Natural Sciences. In the famous Meselson‚ÄìStahl experiment of 1958 he and Frank Stahl demonstrated through nitrogen isotope labeling that DNA is replicated semi-conservatively.Meselson, Stahl, and the Replication of DNA. A History of \\"The Most Beautiful Experiment in Biology\\", Frederic Lawrence Holmes, Yale University Press (2001). In addition, Meselson, Fran√ßois Jacob, and Sydney Brenner discovered the existence of messenger RNA in 1961. Meselson has investigated DNA repair in cells and how cells recognize and destroy foreign DNA, and, with Werner Arber, was responsible for the discovery of restriction enzymes. Since 1963 he has been interested in chemical and biological defense and arms control, has served as a consultant on this subject to various government agencies. Meselson worked with Henry Kissinger under the Nixon administration to convince President Richard Nixon to renounce biological weapons, suspend chemical weapons production, and support an international treaty prohibiting the acquisition of biological agents for hostile purposes, which in 1972 became known as the Biological Weapons Convention. Meselson has received the Award in Molecular Biology from the National Academy of Sciences, the Public Service Award of the Federation of American Scientists, the Presidential Award of the New York Academy of Sciences, the 1995 Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal of the Genetics Society of America, as well as the Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science. His laboratory at Harvard currently investigates the biological and evolutionary nature of sexual reproduction, genetic recombination, and aging. Many of his past students are notable biologists, including Nobel Laureate Sidney Altman, as well as Mark Ptashne, Susan Lindquist, Stephen F. Heinemann, and Richard I. Morimoto. Early life and education Meselson was born in Denver, Colorado, on May 24, 1930 and attended elementary and high-school in Los Angeles, California. While a young child he was interested in chemistry and physics, and conducted many experiments in the natural sciences at home. During World War II, Meselson attended summer school during summer vacations and received enough high school credits to graduate a year and a half ahead of time. When he attempted to acquire his diploma from the registrar at his high school, however, he was informed that in order to receive his high school diploma, he needed three full years of physical education, which he lacked. After searching for options, he enrolled at the University of Chicago at the age of 16 in 1946 intending to study Chemistry, since it did not require a high school diploma to attend. =Higher education= At the University of Chicago, Meselson studied liberal arts including history and classics as an undergraduate from 1946 to 1949 after realizing upon arriving that the University had abolished bachelor's degrees in specialized field such as chemistry and physics. After completing his studies, Meselson spent half a year traveling in Europe. where he spend most of his time reading and making friends. The devastation of the war was still evident in Europe in 1949, as were the beginning tensions of the Cold War. The following year, Meselson returned to Caltech to begin freshman studies again, but disliked the pedagogical approach in most of the courses he took. He enrolled, however, in Linus Pauling's freshman chemistry course, which he loved, and worked on a project for Pauling the same year on hemoglobin structure. Meselson subsequently returned to the University of Chicago for a year to enroll in courses in chemistry, physics, and math, though he did not receive another degree. The following year, he was accepted into a graduate physics program at the University of California at Berkeley where he remained for a year. In the summer of 1953, Meselson was at a swimming pool party at the Pauling home in Sierra Madre (he was friends with Pauling's son Peter and with his daughter Linda), and Pauling asked him what he intended to do the following year. Upon hearing Meselson respond that he intended to return to the University of Chicago, Pauling immediately asked him to come to Caltech to begin graduate studies with him, to which Meselson agreed. As a graduate student of Linus Pauling in chemistry at the California Institute of Technology (1953-1957), Meselson's doctoral dissertation was on equilibrium density gradient centrifugation and on x-ray crystallography. He was Assistant Professor of Physical Chemistry and then Senior Research Fellow at Caltech until he joined the Harvard faculty in 1960. Research In 1957, Meselson and Franklin Stahl (as part of the phage group) showed that DNA replicates semi-conservatively. In order to test hypotheses for how DNA replicates, Meselson and Stahl, together with Jerome Vinograd, invented a method that separates macromolecules according to their buoyant density. The method, equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, was sufficiently sensitive that Meselson and Stahl were able to separate DNA containing the heavy isotope of nitrogen, 15N, from DNA made of the lighter isotope, 14N. In their classic experiment, described and analyzed in a book by science historian Frederic L. Holmes,Meselson, Stahl, and the Replication of DNA. A History of \\"The Most Beautiful Experiment in Biology\\", Frederic Lawrence Holmes, Yale University Press (2001). they grew the bacterium Escherichia coli for many generations in medium containing 15N as the only nitrogen source and then switched the bacteria to growth medium containing 14N instead. They extracted DNA from bacteria prior to switching and, at intervals, for several generations thereafter. After one generation of growth, all the DNA was seen to have a density half way between that of 15N DNA and 14N DNA. In successive generations, the fraction of DNA that was \\"half-heavy\\" fell by a factor of ¬Ω, as the total amount of DNA increased two-fold. When the half-heavy DNA was made single stranded by heating, it separated into two density species, one heavy (containing only 15N) and one light (containing only 14N). The experiment implied that, upon replication, the two complementary strands of the bacterial DNA separate, and that each of the single strands directs the synthesis of a new, complementary strand, a result that verified the suggestion for DNA replication put forward five years earlier by James Watson and Francis Crick and lent important early support for the Watson-Crick model of the DNA molecule. In collaboration with Jean Weigle, Meselson then applied the density gradient method to studies of genetic recombination in the bacteriophage Lambda. The question was whether such recombination involved breakage of the recombining DNA molecules or cooperative synthesis of new molecules. The question could be answered by examining phage particles derived from co-infection of bacteria with genetically marked Lambda phages that were labeled with heavy isotopes (13C and 15N). The density-gradient method allowed individual progeny phages to be characterized for their inheritance of parental DNA and of parental genetic makers. Meselson's initial demonstration of breakage-associated, replication-independent recombination was later found to reflect the activity of a special system that can recombine Lambda DNA at only one spot, normally used by the phage to insert itself into the chromosome of a host cell. Subsequently, variations of the experiment by Franklin Stahl revealed reciprocal dependencies between DNA replication and most genetic recombination.Stahl, F. W. (1998) Recombination in phage Œª: one geneticist's historical perspective\\" Gene 223: 95-102 10.1016/S0378-1119(98)00246-7 With Charles Radding, Meselson developed a model for recombination between DNA duplexes that guided research in the field for the decade from 1973 to 1983. In 1961, Sydney Brenner, Fran√ßois Jacob and Meselson used the density-gradient method to demonstrate the existence of messenger RNA. In subsequent work, Meselson and his students demonstrated the enzymatic basis of host-directed restriction, a process by which cells recognize and destroy foreign DNA and then predicted and demonstrated methyl-directed mismatch repair,Radman, M., R.E. Wagner, Jr., B.W. Glickman, and M. Meselson 1980. DNA Methylation, Mismatch Correction and Genetic Stability. in Progress in Environmental Mutagenesis ed. M. Alacevic. Amsterdam, Elsevier/ North Holland Biomedical Press, pp. 121-130 a process that enables cells to correct mistakes in replicating DNA. Meselson's current research is aimed at understanding the advantage of sexual reproduction in evolution. Meselson and his colleagues have recently demonstrated that Bdelloid rotifers do, in fact, engage in sexual reproduction employing meiosis of an atypical sort. = Meselson effect = When two alleles, or copies of a gene, within an asexual diploid individual evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by William Birky, but is more commonly known as the Meselson effect. In sexual organisms, the processes of recombination and independent assortment allow both of the alleles within an individual to descend from a recent single ancestral allele. Without recombination or independent assortment. alleles cannot descend from a recent ancestral allele. Instead the alleles share a last common allelic ancestor at or just preceding the loss of meiotic recombination. A striking example of this effect was described in bdelloid rotifers, in which the two alleles of the lea gene have diverged into two different genes which work together to preserve the organism during periods of dehydration. The Meselson effect should cause entire copies of an organism's genome to diverge from each other, effectively reducing all anciently asexual organisms to a haploid state, in a process similar to the diploidization following whole genome duplication. However, gene conversion, a form of recombination common in asexual organisms, may prevent the Meselson effect from occurring in young asexual organisms and may limit the effect in Bdelloid rotifers.Flot J-F, Hespeels B, Li X, Noel B, Arkhipova I, Danchin EGJ, Hejnol A, Henrissat B, Koszul R, Aury JM, Barbe V, Barth√©l√©my RM, et al. (2013) Moreover, a number of putative examples of the Meselson effect remain controversial because other biological process, such as hybridation, can mimic the Meselson effect.Sch√∂n I, Martens K, Dijk P (2009) Lost Sex: The Evolutionary Biology of Parthenogenesis. The Netherlands: Springer. 615 p. (chapter 13)  Chemical and biological weapons defense and disarmament  In 1963 Meselson served as a resident consultant in the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, where he became interested in chemical and biological weapons programs and policies. Since then he has been involved in chemical and biological weapons defense and disarmament matters as a consultant to various US government agencies and through the Harvard Sussex Program, an academic research organization based at Harvard and at the University of Sussex in the UK of which he and Julian Perry Robinson in the UK are co-directors. Concluding that biological weapons served no substantial military purpose for the US and that their proliferation would pose a serious threat and that, in years ahead, the exploitation of advanced biology for hostile purposes would be inimical to society generally, he worked to persuade members of the Executive Branch, the Congress and the public that the US had no need for such weapons and that there would be benefits in renouncing them and working for worldwide prohibition. After President Richard Nixon in 1969 canceled the US BW offensive program and endorsed a UK proposal for an international ban, Meselson was among those who successfully advocated international agreements to ban biological and then chemical weapons, leading to the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Meselson and his colleagues have undertaken three on-site investigations with implications for chemical and biological weapons arms control. During August and September 1970, on behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Meselson led a team in the Republic of Vietnam in a pilot study of the ecological and health effects of the military use of herbicides.Statement at hearing: Chemical and Biological Warfare, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, secret hearing held 30 April 1969, sanitized and printed 23 June 1969, 50 pp. SUDOC: Y4.F76/2:W23/2Meselson, M.

In December 1970, President Richard Nixon ordered a \\"rapid but orderly\\" phase-out of herbicide operations in Vietnam.Richard Lyons, New York Times, December 26, 1970 \\"Military to Curb Use of Herbicides\\" https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1970/12/27/82609457.pdf During the 1980s, Meselson investigated allegations that \\"yellow rain\\" was a Soviet toxin weapon being used against Hmong tribespeople in Laos. Citing the physical appearance and high pollen content of samples of the alleged agent; the resemblance of the alleged attacks to showers of feces from swarms of honeybees that he and entomologist Thomas Seeley documented during a 1983 field study in Thailand; the inability of US and UK government laboratories to corroborate initial reports of the presence of trichothecene mycotoxins in samples of the alleged agent and in biomedical samples from alleged victims; the lack of any supporting evidence from extensive interviews with Vietnamese military defectors and prisoners; and other considerations, Meselson and his colleagues argued that the allegations were mistaken.Meselson, M. and J.P. Robinson 2008. The Yellow Rain Affair: Lessons from a Discredited Allegation. Chapter 4 in Terrorism, War or Disease? Unraveling the Use of Biological Weapons. eds. S. Clunan, P. Levoy, S. Martin. Stanford University Press pp 72-96 In April 1980 Meselson served as a resident consultant to the CIA investigating a major outbreak of anthrax among people in the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk. He concluded that on the basis of available evidence the official Soviet explanation that the outbreak was caused by consumption of meat from infected cattle was plausible but that there should be an independent on-site investigation. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was allowed to bring a team to Sverdlovsk in 1992 and again in 1993. Their reports conclusively showed that the official Soviet explanation was wrong and that the outbreak was caused by the release of an anthrax aerosol at a military biological facility in the city.Guillemin, J. 2001.

History  This opening became popular in the Saragossa chess club (Zaragoza, Spain) in 1919. The next year club member Jos√© Juncosa analyzed the opening in Revista del Club Argentino. In 1922 a theme tournament requiring the players to open with 1.c3 was arranged in Mannheim with three participants, Siegbert Tarrasch, Paul Leonhardt and Jacques Mieses, which Tarrasch won.  Basics  The opening of 1.c3 seems at first to be an unambitious move. It opens a diagonal for the queen, but it makes only a timid claim to the center. It prepares to play d4, but White could simply have played that move immediately. Also, the pawn on c3 has the apparent disadvantage of taking the c3-square away from the knight. It is not a terrible move, however, because it is likely to transpose into many solid systems, including a reversed Caro-Kann Defence or Slav Defense (but with an extra tempo for White); the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, after 1.c3 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.cxd4 d5; to a solid but passive type of Queen's Pawn Game after 1.c3 Nf6 2.d4 or 1.c3 d5 2.d4; or to a reversed Scandinavian Defense after 1.c3 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Qxd4!? Nc6 4.Qa4; as well as the Ponziani and Center Game openings, to name just a few. Black has a number of responses, the most common (and effective) being 1...d5, 1...e5, and 1...Nf6. After 1...d5, White can essay the Plano Gambit, 2.e4?!, in effect an unusual response to the Scandinavian Defense. After 2...dxe4, 3.Qa4+ recovers the pawn, but Black gets quick development with 3...Nc6 4.Qxe4 Nf6 5.Qc2 e5. Also reasonable is 1...f5, when 2.d4 transposes into a Dutch Defense where White has played the passive move c3. The reply 1...c5 is also playable, but gives White more opportunity than other moves to transpose into standard openings where he may have a small advantage. The move 1...c5 2.e4 transposes into the Alapin Variation of the Sicilian Defence. The sequence 1...c5 2.d4 is also possible, when 2...cxd4 (2...e6 3.e4 d5, transposing into a French Defence after 4.e5 or 4.exd5, is also possible) 3.cxd4 d5 transposes into a regular Exchange Variation of the Slav Defense (usually reached by 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5), which gives White a slight advantage. The move 1...Nc6 is also possible, as it transposes into the 1.Nc3 system (with colors reversed), where Black embarks on a rather dubious plan with c6 and d5. After 2.d4 d5, Black seems to be holding the admittedly unusual position without particular difficulties.

Baur worked primarily on plant genetics. He was director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Breeding Research (since 1938 Erwin Baur-Institute). Baur is considered to be the father of plant virology. He discovered the inheritance of plastids.Hagemann, R. 2000. Erwin Baur or Carl Correns: who really created the theory of plastid inheritance? . Journal of Heredity 91:435-440. In 1908 Baur demonstrated a lethal gene in the Antirrhinum plant. In 1909 working on the chloroplast genes in Pelargonium (geraniums) he showed that they violated four of Mendel's five laws. Baur stated that #plastids are carriers of hereditary factors which are able to mutate. #in variegated plants, random sorting out of plastids is taking place. #the genetic results indicate a biparental inheritance of plastids by egg cells and sperm cells in pelargonium. Since the 1930s and the work of Otto Renner, plastid inheritance became a widely accepted genetic theory. In 1921 and 1932 Baur co-authored with Fritz Lenz and Eugen Fischer two volumes that became the book Human Heredity, which was a major influence on the racial theories of Adolf Hitler.

Boris was born on 9 May 1901 into a Jewish family. His father, Samuel Osipovich Ephrussi, was a chemical engineer; his grandfather, Joseph Ephrusi (Efrusi), was the founder of a banking dynasty in Kishinev. He published two papers in November 1966 which represented a key step in a decade of research in his laboratory. This research helped transform mammalian, and especially human, genetics.Burian R. 1990. Boris Ephrussi and the Foundations of Developmental Genetics. In Gilbert S. (ed) Developmental Biology, New York, Plenum.Sapp J. 1987. Beyond the gene: cytoplasmic inheritance and the struggle for authority in genetics. New York, Oxford University Press. Boris started his scientific training as a Russian √©migr√© in 1920. He studied the initiation and regulation of embryological processes by intracellular and extracellular factors. A major strand of his early research concerned the effect of temperature on the development of fertilized sea urchin eggs. In this work he used a micromanipulator, which was developed by Robert Chambers, an American biologist. During Ephrussi's time, writing a second dissertation was standard practice in France. Ephrussi's involved culturing tissues. Ephrussi ran into difficulties typically associated with early tissue culture techniques, but despite these obstacles Ephrussi managed to conclude from studies of brachyury in mice that intrinsic factors (i.e. genes) play a key role in development. As the next phase of his career, Ephrussi coupled his embryological concerns with a firm conviction that one must understand the role of genes in order to decipher embryological processes. He moved to Caltech in 1934 and stayed until 1935 to learn genetics within the intellectual empire of T.H. Morgan. This move was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. During this period he conducted important work with George Beadle, who joined him in Paris in the autumn of 1935. There they produced results from experiments with Drosophila eye transplants.Ephrussi B. 1939. G√©n√©tique physiologique. Paris, Hermann. This became integral to the work of Beadle and Tatum, who were working with Neurospora, and from this research developed the 'one gene, one enzyme' hypothesis. During World War II, Ephrussi spent most of his time as a refugee at Johns Hopkins University. Following this he began work in France on yeast and cytoplasmic genetics. He began working at the Institut de Biologie Physicochimique (the Rothschild Institute) in Paris, and later worked at the CNRS at Gif-sur-Yvette, where he studied the contribution of cytoplasm to the cell phenotype and pursued the interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic endowments necessary to the yielding of an intact, functioning (albeit single-celled) organism.Ephrussi B. 1953. Nucleo-cytoplasmic relations in micro-organisms: their bearing on cell heredity and differentiation. Oxford. Boris Ephrussi was a pioneer in questioning the consensus at the time that heredity could be accounted for exclusively by nuclear genes. Ephrussi famously said, \\"we cannot determine the truth of a hypothesis by counting the number of people who believe it.\\"Ephrussi B. 1953. Nucleo-cytoplasmic relations in micro-organisms: their bearing on cell heredity and differentiation. Oxford. page vi. Ephrussi took the words from Joseph Henry Woodger (Symp. Soc. Expl. Biol 2: 354 (1948)) who wrote, \\"Admittedly, some hypotheses have become so well established that no one doubts them. But this does not mean that they are known to be true. We cannot determine the truth of a hypothesis by counting the number of people who believe it, and a hypothesis does not cease to be a hypothesis when a lot of people believe it.\\" Ephrussi continued to work on the topics he was primarily interested until the late 1970s. Topics covered included *using hybrids with teratomas to explore determination and differentiation (e.g. Finch and Ephrussi 1967; Kahan and Ephrussi 1970). *negative regulation of differentiated function (e.g. Davidson, Ephrussi and Yamamoto 1966; Fougbre, Ruiz and Ephrussi 1972). *cellular and genetic biological approaches over a direct attack at the molecular level (Ephrussi 1970, page 12). In 1974 Ephrussi won a Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. Ephrussi lived to see that transplantation was transforming into a genetic tool that would take on a new and more powerful aspect in the molecular era. However he died before seeing the genetic advances made by DNA recombination studies which had been set in motion by the studies he had undertaken. It can be said that Ephrussi was a pioneer of embryology and a main contributor to the reconciliation of modern genetics and Embryology.

Zamia pumila was the first species described for the genus and hence is the type species for the genus Zamia and the family Zamiaceae. Description This cycad contains reddish seed cones with a distinct acuminate tip. The leaves are long, with 5-30 pairs of leaflets (pinnae). Each leaflet is linear to lanceolate or oblong-obovate, 8‚Äì25 cm long and 0.5‚Äì2 cm broad, with distinct teeth at the tip. They are often revolute, with prickly petioles. It is similar in many respects to Zamia furfuracea, but with slightly narrower leaflets, and to Zamia integrifolia, which differs in the more commonly entire (untoothed or only slightly so) leaflets. This is a low- growing plant, with trunk that grows to 3‚Äì25 cm high and diameter, but is often subterranean. Over time, it forms a multi-branched cluster, with a large, tuberous root system, which is actually an extension of the above- ground stems. Like other cycads, Zamia pumila is dioecious, having male or female plants. The male cones are cylindrical, growing to 3‚Äì15 cm long; they are often clustered. The female cones are elongate-ovoid and grow to 6‚Äì15 cm long and 4‚Äì6 cm in diameter. Pollination is by certain insects, namely the belid weevil Rhopalotria slossoni. Habitat and distribution Zamia pumila inhabits a variety of habitats with well-drained sands or sandy loam soils. It prefers filtered sunlight to partial shade. It is now confined to the Dominican Republic; populations formerly also occurred in southern Puerto Rico and Haiti, but have possibly become extinct there due to intensive land use. Populations in Cuba are unconfirmed. Not native in Florida, it is often planted there as a broadleaved evergreen plant mixed with palms and other evergreens in landscape plantings. Ecology This plant is poisonous, producing a toxin called cycasin that affects the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. The toxin can however be removed by careful leaching, and the roots and half-buried stems were used by Native American people for their yield of a starch, formerly known as Florida arrowroot. The plant is also fed upon by various insects, including the butterfly Eumaeus atala, which sequesters the toxin inside its body for use in its own defense. Taxonomy Controversy has long existed over the classification and circumscription of Zamia in the southeastern United States and West Indies. At one extreme, Eckenwalder (1980) included all these plants in a single broadly defined species, Z. pumila. Most other botanists have recognized several more narrowly defined species. The Flora of North America treats the American plants as Z. integrifolia, although some older references continue to refer to these populations as Z. pumila. References *Eckenwalder, J. E. 1980.

In this way the ligand is used as a recyclable extractant. It typically forms charge-neutral complexes with divalent metal ions. Analytical chemistry In the era when metals were analysed by spectrophotometry, many chelating ligands were developed that selectively formed brightly coloured complexes with particular metal ions. This methodology has been eclipsed with the introduction of inductively coupled plasma methodology. Salicylaldoxime can be used to selectively precipitate metal ions for gravimetric determination. It forms a greenish- yellow precipitate with copper at a pH of 2.6 in the presence of acetic acid. Under these conditions, this is the only metal that precipitates; at pH 3.3, nickel also precipitates. Iron (III) will interfere.

And yet its array of airplanes seemed inadequate to perform any kind of real defense against any incursion by an enemy, because there were less than 100 airplanes available to it, all obsolescent or obsolete. In September 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria. This was an area of northeast China, which encompassed the provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang. Nearly six whole years later, in July 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War had begun. As yet, the French colonial authorities were hoping that the Japanese would not be brazen enough to take on the might of a European power. However, it became increasingly likely after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, since Japan was part of the Axis alliance and thus Germany's ally. On September 26, 1940, Japanese troops landed in Haiphong, violating a cease-fire which had been signed only the previous day. From the middle of the following month, the French became heavily involved in repelling Japanese army assaults. The French-Thai War (1940‚Äì1941) Following the Fall of France in 1940, Thais perceived a chance to regain the territories they had lost years earlier. The collapse of Metropolitan France made the French hold on Indochina tenuous. After the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in September 1940, the French were forced to allow the Japanese to set up military bases. This seemingly subservient behavior convinced the Thai regime that Vichy France would not seriously resist a confrontation with Thailand. French forces in Indochina consisted of an army of approximately fifty thousand men, The most obvious deficiency of the French army lay in its shortage of armor; however, the Arm√©e de l'Air had in its inventory approximately a hundred aircraft, of which around sixty could be considered first line. These consisted of thirty Potez 25 TOEs, four Farman 221s, six Potez 542s, nine Morane M.S.406s, and eight Loire 130 flying boats.Ehrengardt, Christian J. and Shores, Christopher.

Consisting of some sixty thousand men, with artillery and tanks. The Royal Thai Navy‚Äîconsisting of several vessels, including two coastal defence ships, twelve torpedo boats and four submarines‚Äîwas inferior to the French naval forces, but the Royal Thai Air Force held both a quantitative and qualitative edge over l'Armee de l'Air.Young, Edward M. (1995) Aerial Nationalism: A History of Aviation in Thailand. Smithsonian Institution Press. Among the 140 aircraft that composed the air force's first-line strength were twenty-four Mitsubishi Ki-30 light bombers, nine Mitsubishi Ki-21 and six Martin B-10 twin-engine bombers, seventy Vought Corsair dive bombers, and twenty-five Curtiss Hawk 75 fighters.Royal Thai Air Force.

While nationalistic demonstrations and anti-French rallies were held in Bangkok, border skirmishes erupted along the Mekong frontier. The superior Royal Thai Air Force conducted daytime bombing runs over Vientiane, Sisophon, and Battambang with impunity. The French retaliated with their own planes, but the damage caused was less than equal. The activities of the Thai air force, particularly in the field of dive-bombing,Young, Edward M.

(1995) Singapore: the Pregnable Fortress: A Study in Deception, Discord and Desertion. Coronet Books. In early January 1941, the Thai Burapha and Isan Armies launched their offensive on Laos and Cambodia. French resistance was instantaneous, but many units were simply swept along by the better-equipped Thai forces. The Thais swiftly took Laos, but Cambodia proved a much harder nut to crack. On January 16, 1941 the French launched a large counterattack on the Thai-held villages of Yang Dang Khum and Phum Preav, initiating the fiercest battle of the war. Because of over-complicated orders and nonexistent intelligence, the French counterattacks were cut to pieces and fighting ended with a French withdrawal from the area. The Thais were unable to pursue the retreating French, as their forward tanks were kept in check by the gunnery of French Foreign Legion artillerists. On January 24, the final air battle took place when Thai bombers raided the French airfield at Angkor near Siem Reap. The last Thai mission commenced at 0710 hours on January 28, when the Martins of the 50th Bomber Squadron set out on a raid on Sisophon, escorted by three Hawk 75Ns of the 60th Fighter Squadron.Ehrengardt, Christian J. and Shores, Christopher. op. cit.Royal Thai Air Force.

About 30% of the French aircraft were rendered unserviceable by the end of the war, some as a result of minor damage sustained in air raids that remained unrepaired.Young, Edward M. (1995) Aerial Nationalism: A History of Aviation in Thailand. Smithsonian Institution Press. The Arm√©e de l'Air admitted the loss of one Farman F221 and two Morane M.S.406s destroyed on the ground, but in reality its losses were greater.Ehrengardt, Christian J. and Shores, Christopher. op. cit. In the course of its first experience of combat, the Royal Thai Air Force claimed to have shot down five French aircraft and destroyed seventeen on the ground, for the loss of three of its own in the air and another five to ten destroyed in French air raids on Thai airfields. Post Pearl Harbor 1941‚Äì1945 The month of December 1941 was a watershed in the war in the Pacific, yet the French aircraft were more or less left to deteriorate on the ground from that time on as Japan began, firstly, to impose what would today be termed \\"no-fly\\" zones over the conquered territory and, subsequently, to demand that airfields in French control be surrendered. Cut off from (Nazi-occupied) Europe, the Arm√©e de l'Air in Indochina became an air force virtually in name only, as lack of fuel and spares kept aircraft grounded, forcing the authorities to strike them off charge progressively as the war progressed. In March 1945, Japan decided to neutralize altogether the token French presence in Indochina, initially by capturing the high-ranking French service chiefs at their headquarters in the capital, Saigon. Despite having less than 30 antiquated aircraft remaining in serviceable condition, though, the Arm√©e de l'Air responded to this aggression and inflicted heavy casualties on Japanese troops, who were pursuing French forces withdrawing towards China, where they did benefit from being re-armed with U.S.-built hardware. The last years of French colonialism in Indochina (1945‚Äì1954) A French A-26C in Indochina. Japan, even though a defeated power by the summer of 1945, exploited long-standing Vietnamese resentment of French colonialism. The first signs of the beginning of the end of the French empire in Indochina came when Vietnamese insurgents attacked and killed French residents in Saigon, prompting the French to send in a combat command (light brigade) of Leclerc's old 2nd Armored Division, among other troops, to help restore order. The Arm√©e de l'Air reinforced the army units in the guise of the so-called Groupe marchant de l'extr√™me-orient (the Far East Forward Group), which included U.S.-built aircraft such as the ubiquitous Douglas C-47 Skytrain, totaling eighteen in number after reinforcements had been brought in. In November 1945, the personnel of the 1st Fighter Wing (consisting of GC I/7 and II/7) arrived in Saigon, but without airplanes. Later on, those units received the F.VIII and F.IX variants of the British Supermarine Spitfire. However, the complement was completed with seized Japanese aircraft, mostly ones dedicated to liaison duties. Although the C-47s were not bombers, a lot of them were jury-rigged in order to fulfill bombing missions over the nine years which remained to the French empire in Indochina. By March 1946, the Arm√©e de l'Air consisted of four units, two of which were fighter units equipped with the Spitfire F.IX, a transport/bombing unit equipped with the C-47 and a further one consisting of examples of the Junkers Ju 52/3m. Indeed, the only French- built aircraft available were Morane-Saulnier MS.500 and Nord NC.702 liaison aircraft, which would be used for observation and evacuation duties as well. (The MS.500 was actually a copy of the German Fieseler Fi 156 \\"Storch\\" (Stork) aircraft.). By March 1947, the \\"Cigognes\\" and \\"Alsace\\" fighter groups had come to Indochina, and they had been joined by the \\"Corse\\" group, equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito. However, just as their RAF counterparts had experienced when stationed in Burma during World War II, the aircraft, dubbed the \\"Wooden Wonder\\" by the British, began to deteriorate as a result of their exposure to a climate that they were not designed to operate in at all. That same month, the Nam-Dinh garrison was encircled, so the transport groups were called upon to drop over 350 airborne troops in order to relieve the besieged troops and thus break the enemy's encirclement. Little by little, the insurgents, fighting the French as a guerrilla army, began to perfect the art and science of guerrilla warfare. Frenchs Grumman F8F Bearcat in ƒê√† N·∫µng, 1954. The future capitals of North and South Vietnam would witness the presence of Arm√©e de l'Air fighter units during the summer and autumn of 1949, as the situation began to deteriorate. Units were relocated from North Africa to Indochina, including I/5 \\"Vend√©e\\" and II/5 \\"Ile de France\\" which were equipped with the Bell P-63 and would remain in theater until January 1951. Firstly, they were stationed at Saigon's main military airbase at Tan Son Nhut before being relocated to the future North Vietnamese capital, where II/6, better known as the famous and highly decorated \\"Normandie-Niemen\\" fighter regiment from their stint in the Soviet Union between 1942 and 1945, joined them. They were certainly needed, as they participated in counterattacks against Vi·ªát Minh guerrillas encircling French army positions in the Tonkin region. Fresh from establishing the People's Republic, the new Maoist government of mainland China began to provide logistical support to the insurgents short of actually supplying troops, something that China would do during the war in Korea, which would start in late June 1950. Communist expansion into what remained of \\"free\\" South-East Asia (apart from Japan, which was still under U.S. occupation at the time) seemed inevitable, and so the U.S. government under Harry S. Truman began to revise their position. In March, General Hartmann, who commanded the Arm√©e de l'Air in Indochina until his death in an air crash in April 1951, wanted to create a \\"Battle Air Corps\\" composed of four fighter, two bomber and four transport groups. Jets were in service with the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy at this time, yet Hartmann believed that they were actually not up to the task of dealing with insurgents as opposed to fighting conventional armies on the ground. As a result, piston-engined fighters, such as the F8F Bearcat, an aircraft from the Grumman stable with one of the most powerful piston engines ever developed for a single-engined aircraft, the Pratt & Whitney P&W; R-2800 radial engine, would be used to combat the insurgents. With this powerful engine (2100 hp), the Bearcat was probably the fastest propeller-driven aircraft with a maximum speed of over 450 mph. (The Americans would follow their lead in their war against the Vi·ªát Minh by using the Douglas A-1 Skyraider piston-engined aircraft during the 1960s.) For the task of dropping large \\"hardware\\" on guerrilla groups, the twin-engined bomber Douglas B-26 Invader would also be chosen. A revised command structure for the Arm√©e de l'Air in Indochina was also put in effect with the creation of three Groupes a√©riens tacticques (Gatac) (\\"Aerial Tactical Groups\\"): Gatac North in Hanoi, Gatac Center in Hu√© and Gatac South in Saigon/Tan Son Nhut. Renewed fighting between the French and the insurgents (in the guise of the 308th and 312th Divisions, commanded by V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p) broke out in January 1951 at Vƒ©nh Y√™n, located in the Tonkin region. Air cover for the French army's \\"mobile groups\\" led by de Lattre was provided by two fighter groups, namely III/6 \\"Roussillon\\" and I/9 \\"Limousin\\", which were able to muster about forty P-63s, and these were reinforced by eight F6Fs lent from II/6 \\"Normandie Niemen\\" and I/6 \\"Corse.\\" During the month, more than 1,700 fighter sorties were flown by 114 out of the 147 aircraft, mostly from Gatac North, then in service protecting Hanoi, while the \\"Normandie-Niemen\\" fighter group was charged with the protection of the southern sector. French bombing capability was very much enhanced with the operational missions flown by dedicated B-26 bombers, assigned to GB I/19 \\"Gascogne\\", during the battle for Mao-Khe (which was the center of the coal mine region in northern Vietnam, and its loss would hurt the French) to protect Haiphong. Giap himself was partly to blame for the fact that the Vi·ªát Minh had been trounced, since air power, which had seen Vƒ©nh Y√™n remain in French hands, and naval power, which had seen M·∫°o Kh√™ remain in French hands, were beyond his experience, and he had thus not planned for them. The Arm√©e de l'Air, now under the command of Chassin, Hartmann's successor, managed to support the French army in repelling a new insurgency from late May to early June 1951, having at its disposal some 48 F8Fs and 23 P-63s in the fighter groups, yet its bomber arm was down to a mere eight B-26s. In support were a combined total of 40 C-47s and Ju 52s. Several months later, after about 6,000 French troops had been killed by Vi·ªát Minh insurgents, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny became commander-in-chief of all the then-190,000-strong French Expeditionary Corps in Indochina (having previously been the commander-in-chief of the Free French forces during the Second World War). He decided to reverse the trend and have the French armed forces adopt an offensive stance as opposed to a defensive one. De lattre won crushing victories at Vinh yen, Mao kh√© and on the Day. The viet minh never attacked again hano√Ø after this. But he was the nrapatrieted to France without have destroyed the viet minh. He would die of cancer in January 1952 after being promoted‚Äîalmost posthumously‚Äîto the rank of Marshal of France. Despite Chassin's call for substantial reinforcements for the Arm√©e de l'Air, whose personnel in theater had been subject to the punishing pace of conducting operations for months, it was ignored. Gatac-Laos, grouping fighters and bombers aircraft which had been requisitioned from various units, was created as a reaction to a Vi·ªát Minh offensive in Laos, launched in April 1953. Three months later, 56 F8Fs and ten B-26s, as well as MS.500s and helicopters, participated in Operation Hirondelle (\\"Swallow\\"), whose objective was to destroy the mat√©riel provided to the insurgents by Maoist China, yet the Vi·ªát Minh did not suffer significantly as a result. The arms were being transported along what became famous as the so-called \\"Ho Chi Minh trail\\", and, in November 1953, to counter this, the French military decided to choose a site near the border with Laos, from which missions could be launched to strike against both Giap's insurgent army in order to eliminate it altogether. Its name was Dien Bien Phu, and it became operational on the 24th of the month, four days after General Henri Navarre launched Operation \\"Castor\\". Dien Bien Phu: the last gasp in Indochina (January‚ÄìMay 1954) By the beginning of 1954, Dien Bien Phu alone required 20 C-119s and 50 C-47s, so, on January 2, Navarre's second-in-command asked for additional aircraft and crews under the so-called \\"Navarre Plan.\\" U.S. President Eisenhower, fearing both domestic and international backlashes if he were to send in U.S. troops, sent an American mission to Indochina to determine the extent of help that the French needed. Following a personal letter from the French prime minister, Joseph Laniel, Eisenhower authorized the loan of aircraft with French markings painted on them and flown by crews from Civil Air Transport (CAT), a commercial airline, which had been started in 1946 by then-retired Major General Chennault, the famous commander of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), better known as the \\"Flying Tigers\\", in China during World War II, and then purchased by the CIA in the year war broke out in Korea. He further authorized the dispatch of American \\"specialists\\" to Indochina, that is, mechanics from the Far East Air Force (FEAF) of the USAF. Once sworn to secrecy owing to the political ramifications of their presence, they would go to work on B-26s at Da Nang (then called Tourane) in the south and on C-47s at Do Son, located south of Haiphong, in the north, respectively. (In fact, Eisenhower was so concerned about their presence, which itself caused the Chinese government to label the American mechanics as \\"combatants\\", that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that he wanted them withdrawn by the end of June 1954 no matter what the situation in Indochina was at that time.) The first Vi·ªát Minh artillery attacks against the base came on March 16, 1954, as a result of which six French F8Fs, five MS.500s and two helicopters were destroyed. The French response could only come from bases located in the northern sector. The Arm√©e de l'Air mustered two fighter groups with F8Fs, two bomber groups with B-26s, while the A√©ronavale (naval aviation) could muster F6F Hellcats, SB2C Helldivers, F4AU-1 and four-engined PB4Y Privateers (navalized versions of the B-24 Liberator heavy bomber). The transport groups provided approximately 100 C-47s, but there were also the twelve Fairchild C-119Cs \\"Boxcars\\" crewed by 24 CAT personnel, to air-drop to the French garrison personnel, food, ammunition, and artillery pieces, as well as tons of barbed wire and other supplies. There was some initial friction between the French and the Americans, as the French commander at the base lodged complaints that the CAT crews were not actually following instructions directly, though this was more to do with a language barrier, as few, if any, of the CAT crews had any Francophone linguistic skills that could allow them to communicate well with the French air traffic controllers. Fortunately, the French garrison included British-born Legionnaires, so they were used as interpreters. As a result, the 37 CAT pilots excelled at their duties, flying a total of 682 missions over Dien Bien Phu and earning the respect of the French. (This respect was finally recognized half a century later when seven of the surviving CAT pilots were created Chevaliers de la L√©gion d'Honneur at a special ceremony at the French embassy in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 2005.) At the same time, however, the insurgents were equipped with Soviet-made weaponry, including 37-mm antiaircraft guns, which were to take a toll of the U.S. and French aircraft trying to attack their forces, including with napalm, in an effort to repel them and thus relieve the besieged garrison, which eventually capitulated to Giap's troops on May 7, 1954. In total, the French lost sixty-two aircraft destroyed or severely damaged in the last major battle fought in French Indochina, which, as a colony, was consigned to history with the signing of an agreement in Geneva in July to carve up Vietnam into two countries along the 17th parallel. France, though, was permitted to maintain a small military presence in the new Republic of Vietnam, known to the West as South Vietnam, and the Americans still present were also permitted to remain, servicing the Arm√©e de l'Air's contingent of B-26s and C-47s, plus the C-119s. They even packed parachutes for French airborne troops. The Americans left Vietnam eventually on September 6, 1954, albeit five days after the original leaving date promised by the French. Other Arm√©e de l'Air units were meanwhile dedicating itself to the training of Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) technical and flight personnel at Nha-Trang. Algeria: the last days of empire in North Africa (1954‚Äì1962) After the fall of the French empire in Indochina, the French Empire was crumbling, as more and more countries vied for independence from Paris. Yet the post-1945 era was one of massive decolonization, and France was having to deal with the realities that went with being a colonial power. France still maintained a sizable presence in North Africa with countries such as Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as colonies. Yet uprisings were on the rise in the 1950s, undoubtedly inspired by the Vi·ªát Minh victory over French expeditionary forces, as it showed that a \\"mighty\\" European power could be dislodged from \\"conquered\\" territory. To meet this threat, the French expanded their presence in North Africa. For the Arm√©e de l'Air in particular, it meant being equipped primarily with U.S.-built aircraft, as had been the case in Indochina. One bomber type in the French armory was the B-26 Invader, equipped with two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 engines. The B-26 began to equip two bombardment wings from the autumn of 1956 onwards based in Algeria, starting with GB 1/91 Gascogne, based at Oran la Senia, followed three months later by GB 2/91 Guyenne based at B√¥ne in eastern Algeria. The B-26 was used in four versions. The B-26B, with a solid nose equipped with 6 to 8 12,7 mm machines- guns and B-26C glass nosed aircraft were used as bombers and for close air support with rockets, bombs and napalm. The famous Norden bombsight fitted to B-26C's could help bombardiers to aim bombs (up to two tons) on targets accurately, even in bad weather. The RB-26 photo-reconnaissance version was used by ERP.1/32 Armagnac. In terms of organizational practice, four RB-26s were grouped alongside 16 B-26s. All these aircraft were designated to perform combat duties at a maximum range of some 600 kilometers from base with a maximum duration of 20 minutes over the target, or else up to 800 kilometers from base with a very short duration over the target. The final version was unofficially called the B-26N, a B-26C converted into a night fighter to interdict planes smuggling weapons from Tunisia. The glass nose was re- designed and equipped with British AI Mk.X radar taken from Meteor NF.11's. The B-26N was armed with two underwing gun pods with two 12,7 mm machine guns each and two rocket pods for air-to-air rockets. The armor on the B-26 made it a particularly useful and versatile aircraft for both bombing and counter- insurgency operations. On March 15, 1957, for example, in the Nord- Constantanois area, a force of no less than 12 B-26s was sent to destroy insurgents hiding in the Movis forest. However, one mission flown on July 15, 1959, witnessed the use of napalm. French army paratroopers had been brought to a standstill by a rebel group near Rafaa, allowing the rebels to control a significant amount of terrain. A B-26 from GB 2/91 took off from Oran, armed with four containers of napalm under the wings. Contact with the army paratroopers proved to be difficult initially, and bad visibility‚Äîbecause it was already dark‚Äîdid not help when the B-26 flew so low that it clipped some trees only meters away from the paratroopers themselves. Worse was the fact that the radio became temporarily inoperable. It was up to the pilot himself to release the napalm on his target even if he was flying at high speed and at (very) low altitude. Probably through blind luck, he managed to drop his load without endangering the lives of the paratroopers.

The first of these was a group of three maintenance sheds opened around 1840 behind Derby station. This developed into a manufacturing facility called the Midland Railway Locomotive Works, known locally as \\"the loco\\" and in 1873 manufacturing was split into locomotive and rolling stock manufacture, with rolling stock work transferred to a new facility, Derby Carriage & Wagon Works. From its earliest days, it had carried out research and development in a number of areas, and in 1933 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway opened the LMS Scientific Research Laboratory. Around 1964, this became part of a new British Rail Research Division, based in the purpose-built Railway Technical Centre, which also housed the Department of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering (DM&EE;) and later the headquarters of British Rail Engineering Limited. Early days Around 1840, the North Midland Railway, the Midland Counties Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Railway set up workshops to the rear of Derby station. Although the Midland Counties had an engine house at Nottingham, the main facilities for all three lines appear to have been, initially at least, those at Derby. That for the Birmingham and Derby was next to its line, near London Road. It was about long and wide, with three lines and three wide archways at its entrance, supporting a water tank. In one corner was a smithy.Radford, J.B., (1971) Derby Works and Midland Locomotives, Ian Allan The Midland Counties' shed was rectangular and about long to the north of the site. Adjacent to it were water and coke facilities, and locomotive repair workshops. The North Midland's became a full repair facility, with a smithy, lathes and other machine tools. These were associated with what is believed to be the first Roundhouse, designed by Francis Thompson. On each side of it, in a vee, were workshops for locomotive and rolling stock repair.Pixton, B., (2000) North Midland: Portrait of a Famous Route, Cheltenham: Runpast Publishing The Midland Counties Railway workshop in Derby 2006 In 1841, problems were becoming apparent with the heat of the exhaust gases through the fireboxes of the locomotives, and the North Midland works assisted George Stephenson in the design of his \\"Long Boiler locomotive\\"Ransome, P.J.G., (1990) The Victorian Railway and How it Evolved, London: Heinemann In the same year, the Midland Counties locomotive \\"Bee\\" (formerly \\"Ariel\\") was fitted with 'Samuel Hills Smoke Consuming Apparatus' in an attempt to conform to the Government's insistence that they should \\"consume their own smoke.\\" This experimentation was carried on with the use of a brick arch in the firebox to use the cheaper coal instead of coke, but it was initially unsuccessful. Midland RailwayMatthew Kirtley= When the three companies merged in 1844 to form the Midland Railway, Derby became its headquarters and the workshops merged to become the Midland Railway Locomotive Works. The immediate task was to achieve some standardisation in the various locomotives that it had inherited. Locomotives at that time were designed and built by manufacturers who might be lacking in actual operating experience with their products. The first Locomotive and Carriage Superintendent was Matthew Kirtley who persuaded various manufacturers to build to his own design and in 1849 50 six-coupled goods engines were delivered. North Midland Railway roundhouse in 2006 After improving the workshops and facilities, including a second roundhouse in 1847, he persuaded the directors that the railway should build its own engines. New building began in 1851 with passenger engines to the \\"Jenny Lind\\" pattern, and more standard goods. He then produced a large \\"single\\" with six-foot six-inch driving wheels. Throughout its existence the Midland never became fully self-sufficient, usually having its locos built by private contractors to its own designs. Initially there was some resistance on the part of Sharp Stewart and Stephenson, who quoted over-long delivery times, so that Kirtley had to accept the maker's own designs. These were good enough, however, that Fowler built some more to a similar pattern. In 1861 he built four banking engines for the Lickey Incline with four-foot drivers instead of the usual five feet. Kirtley's first was a rebuilt but he went on to build six for use to King's Cross, then 15 more. A further, much larger, roundhouse was built in 1852, followed by a large rectangular engine shed with two turntables in 1890. The original North Midland workshop, which by then had become offices, was raised by one storey in 1859‚Äì60, the clock tower being increased in height accordingly. A long footbridge was added from the entrance door to the front of the station, of which only a fragment remains today. A third floor was added in 1893. Another of Kirtley's achievements in 1859 was, at last, to solve the problem of coal burning, by combining the brick arch with a firehole door deflector plate and a blower to increase the draught. Research into track wear was carried out by Robert Forester Mushet, who produced the first double-headed rail using Bessemer steel. Whereas wrought iron rails lasted typically six months, a length of steel rail laid near Derby station 1857 was still in use in 1873. Kirtley also introduced a system of templates and gauges based on the Whitworth system. Meanwhile, wrought iron axles failures were a problem. In 1870‚Äì1871, Kirtley began a programme of research which eventually resulted in the introduction of steel. By the end of the 1860s the works had expanded to such an extent, that he was considering reorganising it; and, in 1873, it separated into the Locomotive Works, remaining behind the station, and Derby Carriage & Wagon Works, further south, off Litchurch Lane. =Samuel Johnson= Kirtley died in office in 1873 leaving a respectable legacy of development and sound locomotives, some of which lasted 80 years. The works reorganisation was completed in 1887 by his successor Samuel Waite Johnson, the carriage and wagon works coming under the control of Thomas Gethyn Clayton. In addition the works took over the old Derby Gas Company works. Johnson continued to build four-coupled passenger locos for the steeper grades, but also some 2-2-2 singles for lighter work. In 1886, the workshop manager, F. Holt, devised a system of applying sand beneath the wheels to improve adhesion. This system is still in use today, using compressed air instead of steam as the propellant. In 1897 a general strike was followed by a rapid rise in the economy. The railway had placed orders for 170 new locos with private builders, all of whom were snowed under. By the end of 1898 none had been delivered and the railway was under pressure from its goods customers, particularly in Sheffield. The Midland ordered 20 s from the Burnham & William's Baldwin Locomotive Works in America which were supplied as parts for assembly. Since the workshops were also full, they had to be assembled in the open air by quickly-recruited labour. Wishing to order 20 more, which Baldwin could not supply, ten were ordered from the Schenectady Locomotive Works. The Baldwin's American appearance raised a good deal of comment. The most famous singles, the Midland Spinners, were built in 1900 and the Belpaire firebox appeared on some s. The first of the \\"Midland Compounds\\" appeared in 1904. This was based on a North Eastern Railway two-cylinder which had been rebuilt to three cylinders, and became the basis for a number of classes over the following years, totalling 240 engines. He also produced a very simple, but robust, goods engine of which 865 were built from 1875 to 1902. =Richard Deeley= Johnson retired in 1903 and was succeeded by Richard Mountford Deeley who began as an apprentice at the works. He carried on much where Johnson had left off, but improved the compounds with an uprated boiler and firebox, also changing the tender to a smaller six-wheeled design. Deeley was very soon promoted to Locomotive Superintendent, with Cecil Paget as Works Manager. Preserved Midland Compound No. 1000 In 1904 two steam motor- carriages for the Morecambe-Heysham service were fitted out at the carriage works. Since he was also Locomotive Superintendent, he reorganised the numbering system in 1907 so that different groups of numbers were used for different classes. Among his improvements to the works, he devised a heavy testing rig for structure testing up to 50 tons in what had developed into a dedicated Engineering Testing Department. By 1900 some 40,000 people were employed, producing 40 new engines a year. Electric power and lighting was installed in the Locomotive Works during 1910, supplied by the company's new generating plant located across the Derby canal at the rear of the Works. An earlier and smaller scale electric generating station had been built by the Midland during March 1893 in Calvert Street, Derby to provide current to light the station offices, the Midland Hotel and the Locomotive Works offices. A textile research facility was opened in Calvert Street for upholstery and seat materials. This facility is thought to have used the buildings made redundant by the closure of the 1893 generating station when the new generating station was brought on line in 1910. =Henry Fowler= In 1907 Paget became General Superintendent, with Henry Fowler becoming Works Manager. In 1908 Paget caused to be built a revolutionary new locomotive, the Paget locomotive based on the Willans high speed central valve engines, some of which had been installed at the works. In 1908 the Heysham to Morecambe line was electrified at 6.6kV 25 Hz and Derby supplied three 60-foot long motor coaches with electrical equipment from Siemens and Westinghouse. In 1909 Henry Fowler became the Mechanical Engineer. For the next five years, rebuilding continued and then came the Great War. From 1914 the works turned to aiding the war effort, producing eleven howitzers by the end of the year. Like most of the other works, Derby produced large number of shells and their components. Initially producing 3000 fuses a week, it installed automated equipment, increasing production tenfold, the work being mainly undertaken by some 500 women. Some new locomotives, however, were built for the Midland's own use and some for the Midland and Great Northern Joint Committee and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. Notable among them were the Somerset and Dorset s, a class of heavy freight locomotives for the Dorset banks, extremely large by Midland standards. Eleven were built in two batches in 1914 and 1925. A new more powerful was designed in 1911 and two were built. Quantity production began in 1917 with 192 being built in the first few years, and a further 580 after grouping up to 1940. Another remarkable engine of this period was the \\"Lickey Banker\\", designed in 1919, by James Clayton for use on the Lickey Incline south of Birmingham. London, Midland and Scottish RailwayGeorge Hughes= The co-operation between the railways in the war effort to some extent smoothed the way to amalgamation in 1923 with the Midland becoming part of the LMS. George Hughes became the Chief Mechanical Engineer. However he preferred to make his headquarters at Horwich, building the famous 2-6-0 \\"Horwich Crabs\\". He was succeeded in 1925 by Sir Henry Fowler, by Ernest Lemon in 1931, and finally in 1932 by William Stanier. The major source of friction, however, was the Midland's policy of using small engines, adding another if the load warranted it, or for hilly stretches. This had worked perfectly well, for the Midland's track in general was level, but trains were becoming heavier. The other major member of the grouping, the LNWR, had already invested in larger engines for its lines north of Manchester. Another passion imported from the Midland was for standardisation, which, in the case of axleboxes was to prove problematic for future heavier locos. Production carried on much as before, of Midland 0-6-0s and 4-4-0 \\"Compounds\\", while Hughes 4-6-0s were built at Horwich and Crewe. However, plans were afoot for something larger, with a \\"Castle\\" class loco borrowed from the GWR for trials between Euston and Carlisle. In 1927, 50 4-6-0s were produced by the North British Locomotive Company and in 1930, production of a further 20 was begun at Derby. =William Stanier= William Stanier was appointed in 1932 as someone from outside of the company who was unaffected by the politics of the various constituent companies within the LMS. His appointment would clearly have been accompanied by a change in attitude which included influencing the civil engineers to invest in strengthening the Midland track and structures. Crewe had been provided by the LNWR with a very large foundry and he concentrated most of the production there. The central drawing office remained in Derby, at Nelson Street, and in 1933, under Lord Stamp, Derby became a national research centre with the establishment of the LMS Scientific Research Laboratory in 1933 on the west side of London Road. The main business of any locomotive works is maintenance and repairs, but Derby continued to build Fowler's 0-6-0s and assisted Crewe with longer production runs, usually with castings provided by Crewe. It also assisted Nelson Street with new ventures, including the LMS's pioneering work with diesel shunters. In 1931, an old Midland Railway Class 1F 0-6-0 tank had been converted by fitting a Davey Paxman diesel engine and a hydraulic transmission by the Derby firm of Haslam & Newton. Although the hydraulic transmission failed in 1936, valuable experience had been gained, and various shunters were ordered from outside manufacturers. Two of these types, one from Armstrong Whitworth powered by a Sulzer engine, the other from Hawthorn Leslie and Company with an English Electric engine, both with electric transmission, provided the future pattern for shunters which would come to be built at Derby, and later the basis for the British Rail Class 08. During World War II the works built Class 5 4-6-0s, and 2-6-4Ts. Charles Fairburn oversaw the building of a Hampden bomber repair facility involving both the Loco and the Carriage & Wagon works. Wings and fuselages were repaired and sent to a private contractor at Nottingham for assembly. In time other aircraft were repaired, including Lancasters. The works also built carriages for field guns and anti-tank guns. =Fairburn and Ivatt= In 1944, Fairburn became Chief Mechanical Engineer when Stanier retired, and he was followed in 1945 by H.G.Ivatt. Locomotive production continued, including new versions of the shunters. The first, from 1936, had a single motor driving the wheels through a jackshaft. This was because the axle-hung motors of the English Electric design had proved difficult to ventilate and had given severe overheating problems. This had been overcome in 1940 by using double reduction gearing on the axle-hung motors and limiting the maximum speed. British Railways When the railways were nationalised in 1947, the works at Derby became part of BR Workshops. From 1948 the works produced 106 Standard Class 4 2-6-4 tank engines, then from 1951 to 1957 turned to Standard Class 5 4-6-0s, 110 in all. The last steam locomotive to be built, bringing the total to 2941, was a BR standard class 5 with Caprotti valve gear, number 73154. In 1948 the first British main-line diesel electric locomotive had been driven out of the paint shop by Ivatt himself, number 10,000, just in time to have LMS livery. Its sibling 10001 began its life in British Railways livery. In 1952 the experimental diesel-mechanical locomotive, the Fell diesel, went into service. View from the station footbridge in 1960 There matters rested until British Rail's Modernisation Plan and in 1958 production began on the first ten Type 2 main line locos, later known as the Class 24 or, in popular culture, the \\"Derby Sulzers\\". In 1959 the first of the Type 4s, later classified Class 44, \\"Scafell Pike\\" emerged from the works. The Class 24 were followed by the Class 25, and the Class 44 by the Class 45 and Class 46. The full complement having been achieved in 1962, new production was concentrated at Crewe, but Derby received one more order when Beyer Peacock Ltd asked to be released from its contract. When production ceased in 1966, over a thousand diesel locos had been built at Derby. The only new build after that time was six electric non-driving motor coaches in 1978 to power the six Advanced Passenger Train formations. Recent history In 1964 British Railways established the British Rail Research Division, which reported directly to the British Railways Board (BRB). It was the first to move into the new Railway Technical Centre on London Road opposite the old LMS research building. followed by the BRB Department of Mechanical & Electrical Engineering (DM&EE;). In 1969 the workshops were turned into the BR subsidiary British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) which also had its headquarters in the Railway Technical Centre. In 1990 the closure of BREL Derby locomotive works was announced. The locomotive works was mostly demolished, part of the plant was used for bogie production by Bombardier Transportation (Bombardier Derby Pride Park); though identified as a primary production site by Bombardier in 2001, in 2004 it was announced that the bogie plant was to close due to overcapacity in the European rail industry. The works site, along with the land formerly occupied by Chaddesden sidings and the gas works, was renamed \\"Pride Park\\", part of which is occupied by the Derby County Football Club's Pride Park Stadium = The Roundhouse = After determined campaigning by heritage groups, the original North Midland roundhouse, with the original Midland Railway offices and the original Midland Counties workshop, was spared. (The Birmingham and Derby's workshops had been demolished around 1870.) Though Grade 2 listed, they became more and more derelict. There was talk for a while of Pete Waterman taking them over. However, in 2006 it was bought from the city council for ¬£1 by Derby College, which planned to spend ¬£36 million to restore it for use as a college campus, with grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the East Midlands Development Agency. The campus opened to students in September 2009. Tours of the Roundhouse are available throughout the year Roundhouse Tours. Although the locomotive works is no more, railway work is carried on elsewhere in the city by a number of private companies. In 2014 the Derby and Derbyshire Rail Forum celebrated 175 years of the railway in Derby, claiming that, even now, it \\"is the largest cluster of rail related businesses on the planet.\\"http://www.derby175.co.uk/ The Carriage Works has continued in production and, as of 2012 builds multiple units under its present owner Bombardier Transportation.

The lights can be seen from the Blue Ridge Parkway at mile posts 310 (Brown Mountain Light overlook) and 301 (Green Mountain overlook) and from the Brown Mountain Overlook along North Carolina Highway 181 (NC 181), near Jonas Ridge, North Carolina. Additionally, good sightings of the lights have been reported from the top of Table Rock and Wiseman's View, both located in the Linville Gorge Wilderness. History Brown Mountain One early account of the lights dates from September 24, 1913, as reported in the Charlotte Daily Observer. A fisherman claimed to have seen ‚Äúmysterious lights seen just above the horizon every night,‚Äù red in color, with a pronounced circular shape. Soon after this account, a United States Geological Survey employee, D.B. Stewart, studied the area in question and determined the witnesses had mistaken train lights for something more mysterious.  Research  Reports of odd lights continued, and a more formal US Geological Survey study began in 1922, which determined that witnesses had misidentified automobile or train lights, fires, or mundane stationary lights. However, according to a marker on the Blue Ridge Parkway, a massive flood struck the area soon after the completion of the USGS study; all electrical power was lost and trains were inoperative for a period of time thereafter. Several automotive bridges were also washed out. The Brown Mountain lights, however, continued to appear. In popular culture The lights are the inspiration for the bluegrass song ‚ÄúBrown Mountain Lights,‚Äù by Scotty Wiseman, later performed by The Hillmen (Vern Gosdin ‚Äì vocals) and also the Kingston Trio and the Country Gentlemen. In this version, the light is being carried by \\"a faithful old slave/come back from the grave\\" who is searching for his lost master. The song was also recorded by the progressive bluegrass band Acoustic Syndicate and performed by Yonder Mountain String Band. This song was also performed and recorded by Sonny James, Roy Orbison, Tommy Faile, and Tony Rice. The 1999 episode \\"Field Trip\\" of the paranormal drama show The X Files centered around a mysterious case of missing hikers that were found dead in the vicinity of the Brown Mountains of North Carolina; the show mentions the Brown Mountain Lights (the show's main character Fox Mulder believed it was due to UFOs). It was featured in episodes of Weird or What?, Ancient Aliens, and Mystery Hunters. It is described as the basis for the 2014 feature film Alien Abduction. The mountains and the lights are featured in Speaking in Bones (2015) by Kathy Reichs.

He was an All-Pacific-10 Conference selection and an All-America selection as a senior. Professional careerBaltimore Stallions= After graduating from Arizona, Miller signed in 1994 playing for the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League (recommended by Rich Ellerson, his former Arizona coach who once was a CFL staffer) and was a member of the 1995 Grey Cup champion team. Miller recorded a \\"single\\" in the 83rd Grey Cup when a punt, aided by a 50-km/h wind at Taylor Field in Regina, Saskatchewan bounded over the head of a Calgary Stampeders return man and out the back of the end zone to award Baltimore a single point. =Seattle Seahawks= Miller spent the preseason with the Seattle Seahawks before being released in the fall of the 1996 season. =Pittsburgh Steelers= In 1996 Miller joined the Pittsburgh Steelers. He stayed with the team through 2003, and continues to make his home in Pittsburgh. In a 2003 game against the Baltimore Ravens, Miller completed an 81-yard touchdown pass to Steelers' teammate Chris Hope. This tied a record held by Gary Hammond and Arthur Marshall for the longest pass completion by a non-quarterback in NFL history. =New England Patriots= Before the 2004 season Miller signed with the Patriots, with whom he played during the 2004, 2005, and 2006 seasons. In Super Bowl XXXIX, Miller had two notable punts, one to the Eagles' 7-yard line and another that pinned the Eagles back at their own 4-yard line with just 46 seconds left in the game. In his career with the Patriots, Miller played in 42 straight regular season games, before being placed on injured reserve on November 24, 2006. Miller was released on August 16, 2007. =Tennessee Titans= On September 21, 2007, Miller signed with the Tennessee Titans due to injuries to Craig Hentrich, and made his debut against New Orleans Saints on September 24, 2007. On December 17, 2007, the Titans released him. He was later re-signed by the Titans on May 23, 2008 only to be released again on August 19, 2008. The Titans re-signed Miller four games into the 2008 regular season on October 4, 2008. The team released quarterback Chris Simms to make room for Miller on the roster, but two days later Miller was released again as Simms was re-signed. Post-NFL career Miller joined KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh as an analyst on July 13, 2010 and also provides commentary for its sister television station KDKA-TV. He co-hosted The Fan Morning Show with Colin Dunlap and Jim Colony until April 2018. Miller is the president and co- founder, along with Jason Silver, of Bardownski Hockey and GELSPORT. As part of GELSPORT, Miller and Silver created a line of weighted training aids for hockey, lacrosse, and golf.

(1956) Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, DoubleDay Early sightings primarily occurred in the southwestern United States, particularly in New Mexico. They were once of notable concern to the US government because they were often clustered around sensitive research and military installations, such as Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratory, then Sandia base. Meteor expert Dr. Lincoln LaPaz headed much of the investigation into the fireballs on behalf of the military. LaPaz's conclusion was that the objects displayed too many anomalous characteristics to be a type of meteor and instead were artificial, perhaps secret Soviet spy devices. The green fireballs were seen by many people of high repute including LaPaz, distinguished Los Alamos scientists, Kirtland AFB intelligence officers and Air Command Defense personnel.Page 50, Ruppelt Edward, J. (1956) Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, DoubleDay A February 1949 Los Alamos conference attended by aforementioned sighters, Project Sign, world-renowned upper atmosphere physicist Dr. Joseph Kaplan, H-bomb scientist Dr. Edward Teller, other scientists and military brass concluded, though far from unanimously, that green fireballs were natural phenomena. To the conference attendees, though the green fireball source was unknown, their existence was unquestioned.Pages 50-51, Ruppelt Edward, J. (1956) Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, DoubleDay Secret conferences were convened at Los Alamos to study the phenomenon and in Washington by the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board.Transcript of Los Alamos conference In December 1949 Project Twinkle, a network of green fireball observation and photographic units, was established but never fully implemented. It was discontinued two years later, with the official conclusion that the phenomenon was probably natural in origin.Ruppelt, 78‚Äì79, 81; Clark 1998, 263; Maccabee, 149‚Äì161; , Green fireballs have been given natural, man-made, and extraterrestrial origins and have become associated with both the Cold War and ufology.Ruppelt Edward, J. (1956) \\"report on unidentified flying objects\\", DoubleDayJerome, Clark (1998) \\"The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial\\", Visible Ink PressMaccabee, Bruce (2000) \\"The UFO-FBI Connection\\", Llewellyn Publications Because of the extensive government paper trail on the phenomenon, many ufologists consider the green fireballs to be among the best documented examples of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Early green fireballs Some early reports came from late November 1948, but were at first dismissed as military green flares. Then on the night of December 5, 1948, two separate plane crews, one military (Air Force C-47, Captain Goede, 9:27 p.m., east of Albuquerque) and one civilian (DC-3, Pioneer Flight 63, 9:35 p.m., east of Las Vegas, New Mexico), each asserted that they had seen a \\"green ball of fire\\"; the C-47 crew had seen an identical object 22 minutes before near Las Vegas.Page 48, Ruppelt Edward, J. (1956) Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, DoubleDay The military crew described the light as like a huge green meteor except it arched upwards and then flat instead of downwards The civilian crew described the light as having a trajectory too low and flat for a meteor, at first abreast and ahead of them but then appearing to come straight at them on a collision course, forcing the pilot to swerve the plane at which time the object appeared full moon size.Pages 47-48, Ruppelt Edward, J. (1956) Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, DoubleDay Two AFOSI investigators -- both of whom were experienced pilots themselves -- witnessed a green fireball while flying an aircraft the evening of December 8. They said it was about above their craft, roughly resembling the green flares commonly used by the Air Force, though \\"much more intense\\" and apparently \\"considerably brighter.\\" The light seemed to burst into full brilliance almost instantaneously. Their report stated that the light was \\"definitely larger and more brilliant than a shooting star, meteor or flare.\\" The light lasted only a few seconds, moving \\"almost flat and parallel to the earth\\". The light's \\"trajectory then dropped off rapidly\\" leaving \\"a trail of fragments reddish orange in color\\" which then fell towards the ground. The next day, AFOSI consulted Dr. Lincoln LaPaz, an astronomer from the University of New Mexico. LaPaz himself saw a \\"green fireball\\" on December 12, which was also seen at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, enabling LaPaz to determine the trajectory using triangulation. From this LaPaz discovered that the center of the trajectory was straight over Los Alamos. In a classified letter to the Air Force on December 20, LaPaz wrote that the object moved far too slowly to have been a meteor and left no \\"trail of sparks or dust cloud\\" as would be typical of meteors flying at low altitudes. On January 13, 1949, the following message was sent to the Director of Army Intelligence from Fourth Army Headquarters in Texas: \\"Agencies in New Mexico are greatly concerned . . .Some foreign power [may be] making 'sensing shots' with some super-stratosphere device designed to be self-disintegrating . . . The phenomena [may be] the result of radiological warfare experiments by a foreign power . . . the rays may be lethal or might be . . . the cause of the plane crashes that have occurred recently . . . These incidents are of such great importance, especially as they are occurring in the vicinity of sensitive installations, that a scientific board [should] be sent . . . to study the situation.\\" On January 30 the brightest and most widely seen green fireball sighting occurred near Roswell, New Mexico. The next day, the FBI was informed by Army and Air Force intelligence that flying saucers and the fireballs were classified top secret. LaPaz interviewed hundreds of witnesses, with help from the FBI and military intelligence, and again tried to recover fragments by triangulating a trajectory, but was again unsuccessful. After his own sighting and interviewing numerous witnesses, LaPaz had concluded that \\"green fireballs\\" were an artificial phenomenon. On February 8, he met with Dr. Joseph Kaplan, a UCLA geophysicist and member of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. LaPaz's informal scientific study for the Air Force quickly became formal, being called the \\"Conference on Aerial Phenomena\\", convening at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in mid-February to review the data. The scientists felt that a network of instrument stations should be established to photograph and analyze the fireballs. By April 1949 similar sights were reported over a nuclear-weapons storage facility at Fort Hood in Texas. The intrusions were deemed so serious that, unlike the Air Force, the Army quickly set up an observation network. On July 24 a green fireball was observed falling close to Socorro, New Mexico. Dust samples were collected at the School of Mines there and were found to contain large particles of copper. LaPaz found this highly significant, since copper burns with the same yellow-green color characteristic of the green fireballs. He also noted that if the copper particles came from the green fireballs, then they could not be conventional meteorites, since copper was never found in dust of meteoric origin. LaPaz suggested that further air and ground samples be taken in areas where the fireballs were seen. Another Los Alamos conference convened on October 14. Among the puzzles were the sudden onset and the high concentration of sightings in New Mexico, quite unlike natural phenomena. Despite this, it was decided the fireballs were probably atmospheric in origin. Instrumented observations‚Äîphotographic, triangulation, and spectroscopic‚Äîwere deemed essential to solving the mystery. On November 3 Dr. Kaplan brought the plan to the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board at the Pentagon. Kaplan by this time had decided the fireballs might be a new type of rare meteor. Nonetheless, most of the scientists remained puzzled by the brightness, trajectories, and absence of sound. Seeming to contradict his meteor hypothesis, Kaplan also said, \\"This high selectivity of direction seems to indicate that some group was trying to pinpoint Los Alamos with a new sort of weapon.\\" Concerns were expressed about the possibility of panic and the need for continued secrecy. Project Twinkle Finally, on December 20 after nearly a year of delay, the instrument observation program was approved and Project Twinkle was born. The first instrument post (consisting of two officers) was established at Holloman Air Force Base in February 1950. Only one other instrument post was ever set up. LaPaz criticized Project Twinkle as inadequate, arguing the green fireballs were worthy of \\"intensive, systematic investigation\\". Twinkle did manage to record a few events, but the data collected were said to be incomplete in the final Twinkle report. Besides, it was stated, no funding had been provided for follow-up data analysis. In addition, the fireball activity near the observation posts seemed to virtually disappear, as noted in a report from September: \\"It may be considered significant that fireballs have ceased abruptly as soon as a systematic watch was set up.\\" Over the objections of LaPaz and others, the final report on Project Twinkle (see external links) concluded the green lights were probably a natural event, maybe sunspot activity or an unusual concentration of meteors. The report stated, \\"There has been no indication that even the somewhat strange observations often called 'Green Fireballs' are anything but natural phenomena.\\" Twinkle was discontinued in December 1951. Despite efforts of the final Twinkle report to downplay the fireballs and other studied UFO phenomena as natural, a follow-up report in February 1952 from the USAF Directorate of Intelligence disagreed: :\\"The Scientific Advisory Board Secretariat has suggested that this project not be declassified for a variety of reasons, chief among which is that no scientific explanation for any of the fireballs and other phenomena was revealed by the report and that some reputable scientists still believe that the observed phenomena are man-made.\\" The following month, another letter from the Directorate of Intelligence to the Research Division of the Directorate of Research and Development again stated that the report should not be publicly released, since no real solution had been provided: :\\"It is believed that a release of the information to the public in its present condition would cause undue speculation and give rise to unwarranted fears among the populace such as occurred in previous releases on unidentified flying objects. This results from releases when there has been no real solution.\\" Opinions of Los Alamos scientists Edward J. Ruppelt, director of the USAF Project Blue Book UFO study, stated he visited the Los Alamos National Laboratory in early 1952 and spoke to various scientists and technicians there, all of whom had experienced green fireball sightings. None of them believed they had a conventional explanation, such as a new natural phenomenon, secret government project, or psychologically enlarged meteors. Instead, the scientists speculated that they were extraterrestrial probes \\"projected into our atmosphere from a 'spaceship' hovering several hundred miles above the earth.\\" Ruppelt commented, \\"Two years ago I would have been amazed to hear a group of reputable scientists make such a startling statement. Now, however, I took it as a matter of course. I'd heard the same type of statement many times before from equally qualified groups.\\" Ruppelt, Chapter 4 However, such opinions were apparently not unanimous. Immediately afterward, Ruppelt said he visited LaPaz in Albuquerque. Ruppelt reported that \\"LaPaz said that some people, including Dr. Joseph Kaplan and Dr. Edward Teller, thought that the green fireballs were natural meteors. But he didn't think so.\\" LaPaz then reiterated the various anomalous characteristics which led him to believe the fireballs were artificial. Ruppelt also mentioned that he had previously met with Kaplan in Los Angeles, and although Kaplan respected LaPaz professionally, he was not convinced that the fireballs were man-made. Ruppelt further mentioned that he discussed the issue with some of the people who had been at the Los Alamos meeting in February 1949, but did not provide any names. \\"People who were at that meeting have told me that Dr. LaPaz's theory was very interesting and that each point was carefully considered. But evidently it wasn't conclusive enough because when the conference broke up, after two days, it was decided that the green fireballs were a natural phenomenon of some kind.\\" However, despite what Ruppelt may have been told and then reported in his book, there is nothing in the actual transcript of the conference that indicates that such a group decision was ever reached. Instead, opinions remained divided, much puzzlement was expressed, and further research was recommended to help resolve the issue. Astronomer sightings of green fireballs Other astronomers besides LaPaz known to have sighted green fireballs in New Mexico during this period were Clyde Tombaugh, who in 1956 said he had seen three, and Dr. Donald Menzel, who sighted one in May 1949 near Alamogordo. In a letter to the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, Menzel admitted the phenomenon must be real and expressed puzzlement, wondering why the fireballs should be so confined to New Mexico if they were natural phenomena.Menzel letter, May 16, 1949, cited at an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board meeting on the green fireballs in Washington, D.C., Nov. 3, 1949. The quoted section read, \\"Circumstances force me to conclude that the phenomena described are actually real. With regard to Dr. Kaplan's [meteor] explanation, which deserves very serious consideration, I merely raise the question as to why the phenomenon seems to be confined to the Alamogordo region.\\" Menzel eventually became a famous UFO debunker, and in two of his books stated he was never puzzled by his sighting, instantly identifying the object as an ordinary meteor fireball.For example, in contrast to his 1949 private statement to the Air Force that he didn't find the meteor explanation totally adequate, Menzel later wrote in his UFO debunking book \\"The UFO Enigma\\" (1977) with Ernest Tavres that, \\"He and several other astronomers present observed the bright green object as it slowly traversed the northern sector of the heavens, moving from east to west: they quickly and unequivocally identified it as a meteor, or bolide...\\" Green fireballs after Project Twinkle Despite the discontinuation of Project Twinkle, green fireballs were still occasionally sighted and LaPaz continued to comment. In early November, 1951, a month before the official termination of Twinkle, a huge flurry of green fireball sightings occurred in the Southwest and other states. LaPaz was widely quoted saying that such a concentration of fireballs was unprecedented in history, and he didn't believe they were a natural phenomenon. (More details below in Atomic testing and fallout theory) In April 1952 the green fireballs and Project Twinkle were written up in a famous Life magazine article titled \\"Have We Visitors From Space?\\" A recent green fireball incident over Arizona from November 1951 was mentioned. LaPaz again repeated why the fireballs could not be ordinary meteors. The article also described LaPaz's UFO sighting near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 10, 1947, about the same time as the famous Roswell UFO incident. LaPaz, however, remained anonymous. Also described was a 1949 UFO sighting by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto (Life magazine article). In January 1953 LaPaz was quoted in newspaper articles saying the green fireballs were artificial devices and might be a Soviet missile scouting the U.S. and other parts of the world. According to Ruppelt, the green fireballs reappeared in September 1954. One the size of a full moon was seen streaking southeast across Colorado, lighting up Denver, and into northern New Mexico. It was seen by thousands at a football stadium in Santa Fe. LaPaz was called back in to investigate, but told a reporter that he did not expect to find anything. From April 3 to 9, 1955, five green fireballs were reported in New Mexico and two in northern California. At least three were reported within minutes of one another midmorning of April 5. LaPaz stated, \\"This is a record . . . I'm sure the yellow-green fireballs aren't ordinary meteorite falls. I've been observing the skies since 1914, and I've never seen any meteoritic fireballs like them.\\" In a visit by astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek in March 1965, LaPaz told Hynek that one had been reported as recently as the previous Christmas (Steiger, p. 132). Atomic testing and fallout theory A recent theory of the green fireballs was introduced in Robert Hastings' 2008 book UFOs and Nukes. Although it had been a concern from the beginning to military intelligence that the sightings seemed concentrated near sensitive nuclear facilities such as Los Alamos and Kirtland AFB, researcher Dan Wilson discovered that later heavy concentrations of sightings might also be correlated with atomic tests that began in Nevada in January 1951. In particular, green fireball sightings, and other reported UFO sightings, seemed to follow the drift of the fallout clouds as winds carried them into other states. Hastings cites a number of examples from Wilson's research.Robert Hastings, UFOs and Nukes, 2008, pp. 64-84. Perhaps the most graphic example occurred during the \\"Buster series\\" of atomic tests on November 1 and 5, 1951, which were accompanied by so many reported green fireball sightings in states affected by fallout, that even the New York Times carried a story on November 9, \\"Southwest's 7 Fireballs in 11 Days Called 'Without Parallel in History'.\\" Dr. LaPaz was widely quoted saying, \\"There has never been a rate of meteorite fall in history that has been one-fifth as high as the present fall. If that rate should continue, I would suspect the phenomenon is not natural... [they] don't behave like ordinary meteorites at all.\\" Initially the green fireballs were reported in Arizona and New Mexico as the fallout clouds left Nevada, but as the clouds spread out and drifted further east, south, and north, green fireball sightings then followed in Texas, northern Mexico, Iowa, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, and New York. Portions of the fallout also drifted west into the Los Angeles area on November 7, followed the next day by a green fireball sighting there. Time magazine also took note on November 19, in a somewhat satirical article titled \\"Great Balls of Fire.\\" In the article, they lightheartedly speculated that the green fireballs were connected to the atomic testing.Hastings, 64-70 Summarizing the rash of fireball sightings in November 1951, Wilson commented, \\"Some researchers imply that the radioactivity itself was producing the green fireballs, possibly as an electrostatic effect. Dr. Lincoln La Paz thought otherwise. He said that the green fireballs move too regularly and had been sighted earlier, on a number of occasions, at the Los Alamos and Sandia atomic labs, where no measurable radiation was released, as well as at Killeen Base, in Texas, where the weapons were simply stored. So it seems that the electrostatic theory doesn't stand up.\\" Wilson concluded, \\"We can make one statement of fact: the fireball sightings--green or otherwise--occurred in areas that received radioactive debris from Operation Buster. Was this just coincidence, or a planned occurrence? We simply don't know, so all we can do is to continue to collect data and see if some overwhelmingly convincing pattern emerges.\\" Wilson nonetheless felt the evidence pointed to the fireballs being real, artificial, and those responsible having some sort of agenda.\\"Hastings, 70 Hastings then noted similar comments by Project Blue Book head Edward Ruppelt, citing the opinion of a number of Los Alamos scientists on the green fireballs when he visited in early 1952, that they might be extraterrestrial probes from an orbiting spacecraft. (See Opinions of Los Alamos scientists above.) Condon Committee theory In the 1969 Condon Committee UFO report, astronomer William K. Hartmann thought the green fireballs might be explained by lunar material ejected during recent meteor impacts on the Moon's surface . Hartmann's reasoning was that such ejected lunar meteors could account for the abnormally low velocities calculated for the green fireballs by LaPaz of about Earth's escape velocity, that is, much lower than normal meteor velocities. Hartmann further claimed, without explanation or elaboration, that \\"the predicted characteristics match those of the 'green fireball episode'.\\" However, an object coming from the moon would enter the earth's atmosphere with a speed almost as high as the escape velocity of the earth, 11 km/s. And the theory would not account for the many other anomalous characteristics of the green fireballs detailed by LaPaz, such as strong confinement to the New Mexico area, lime-green color, low altitude yet absence of sound, absence of smoke trail, and absence of meteorite fragments. Despite the entirely speculative nature of Hartmann's hypothesis, it is sometimes cited as scientific fact: for example, astronomer Carl Sagan presented it as such in his Cosmos television series in 1980 . Other UFO Investigations of Dr. Lincoln LaPazRoswell Incident (1947)= At least three witnesses, including two involved with Army and Air Force counterintelligence, also claimed that LaPaz was brought in after the Roswell UFO incident to interview witnesses and reconstruct the trajectory of the crash object (affidavit of one witness). One counterintelligence agent claimed LaPaz told him he thought the object got into trouble, touched down for repairs, took off again, and then exploded. The two of them then speculated about possible origins. LaPaz allegedly held the opinion that the object was an unoccupied extraterrestrial probe. However, UFO researcher Karl T. PflockPflock, Karl T. Roswell : Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe Prometheus Books, 2003 discovered some facts that might call into question some aspects of this testimony. For example, one of the purported witnesses to LaPaz's Roswell involvement claimed that LaPaz spoke fluent Spanish, but by interviewing family members, Pflock discovered that LaPaz did not speak any Spanish. =Anomalous satellites (mid-1950s)= Besides LaPaz's consultations with the Air Force on the green fireballs, in 1954 he was also involved with astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in a search for near- Earth orbiting satellites on behalf of the Army (several years before Sputnik became the first man-made satellite). In August 1954 a story broke in the press that Tombaugh and LaPaz had found two of the satellites only 400 and out that had recently come into orbit. But LaPaz later denied the report. (See Clyde Tombaugh for details.) =Zamora/Socorro Incident (1964)= In 1964 LaPaz was also involved peripherally in the investigation of the famous Socorro UFO incident, in which a Socorro policeman named Lonnie Zamora claimed to have seen a small egg-shaped object land, saw two humanoid figures near the object, and then when he approached to within , the object blasted off and rapidly disappeared. LaPaz interviewed Zamora and vouched for him as a witness. =Green fireballs revisited (1965)= LaPaz's last known comments on the green fireballs occurred in 1965 during a visit by astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a consultant to the Air Force's Project Blue Book. Hynek was also investigating the Socorro incident. According to Hynek, LaPaz felt the fireballs were the most important part of the UFO phenomenon. He remained convinced that the fireballs' anomalous characteristics had never been adequately explained by the official investigation. LaPaz continued to think the green fireballs were artificial, but now believed the fireballs, and also the Socorro craft, to be highly secret projects of the U.S. government. He also accused Hynek, Project Blue Book, and others of being part of \\"a grand cover-up for something the government does not want discussed\\".Steiger, pp. 132, 136 Green fireballs outside the United States There have been reports of green fireballs outside the U.S. and long after the early days of Project TwinkleBlog listing modern green fireball reports from witnesses often near sensitive government or military bases: Randles and Houghe note that a Royal Air Force pilot had a near collision with three unusual green fireballs near Manchester, England, and fireballs were also sighted near a nuclear power plant in Suffolk in 1983 (Randles and Houghe, p. 92). There was also a sighting of a green fireball in Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada in the summer of 2011. Cold Lake notably has the largest air force base in all of Canada, and after several local protests in the 1980s, Cold Lake no longer has nuclear weapons. On October 31, 2016, a green fireball was witnessed over the predawn skies of Niigata Prefecture in northern Japan. Another Fireball was spotted in Kildare, Ireland on the 22nd of November 2016. On November 26, 2016 another was spotted just north of Calgary, Alberta around 6:45 local time. In South Africa, a green UFO was spotted 1000 feet in the sky of Jeffreys Bay. A Boeing 737 cargo aircraft captain and co-pilot, flying from Cape Town International Airport to Port Elizabeth International Airport, reported seeing what appeared to be a green object increasing in altitude past the cockpit of their aeroplane, reaching to about a thousand feet into clouds above them, and then returning towards earth at high speed past the cockpit of the aeroplane,\\" NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said. \\"The sighting was reported to air traffic control at Port Elizabeth International Airport who requested NSRI's assistance to investigate the possibility that an aircraft or craft may be in difficulty.\\" Lambinon said the NSRI's Jeffreys Bay team monitored the matter throughout the night. \\"The green object has not been seen since and there are no reports of anyone, or craft or aircraft overdue or missing.\\" On June 17, 2020 a green fireball has been seen flying over Pilbara, Australia and various other places in the region.

She was the first Navy ship named for Admiral William T. Sampson (1840‚Äì1902). Sampson was laid down on 21 April 1915 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts, launched on 4 March 1916, sponsored by Miss Marjorie Sampson Smith, and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 27 June 1916, Commander B. C. Sampson in command. Service historyWorld War I= Torpedo-boat destroyer Sampson was assigned to Division 9 of the Atlantic Destroyer Force and conducted shakedown training out of Narragansett Bay. During the First World War she was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Mark L. Hersey, Jr. - the son of Major General Mark L. Hersey. Hersey received the Navy Cross for distinguished service while commanding the Sampson and would rise to the rank of commodore during the Second World War. After war games off Provincetown, Massachusetts, Sampson cleared Tompkinsville, New York on 15 May 1917 to join the escort screen of a convoy which touched at Halifax and reached Queenstown, Ireland, on 25 May 1917. She reported for duty with the United States Naval Forces operating in European waters and was assigned to convoy escort duty in the approaches to the British Isles, basing her operations from Queenstown. Two British-type depth charge projectors were installed on her stern; and, on 29 May, she commenced escort duty and protected the troop transports and merchant convoys from hostile submarines throughout the remainder of World War I. On 18 June 1917, Sampson rescued two small boat loads of survivors of the and the captain and 13 sailors from . The next morning, she picked up another 17 survivors of Elele; and, on the 20th, she landed all at Queenstown. Sampson answered other distress calls before the end of the war, and she made several attacks to drive off submarines reported or seen near her convoys. She steamed from France with the Queenstown division of destroyers on 29 November 1918 and stood out from Brest Harbor on 12 December to escort President Woodrow Wilson on board into the harbor. Returning to Queenstown on 14 December, she sailed for home on the 26th and arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 7 January 1919. =Post war=4th Division, 2nd Flotilla Destroyer Force After repairs in the New York Navy Yard, Sampson was assigned to the 4th Division, 2d Flotilla, of the Destroyer Force and sailed on 22 March 1919 to base her operations from the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. She reported to the Inspector of Ordnance for experimental testing of torpedoes and mines, but interrupted this duty in May 1919 to assist in guarding the route of NC-4 during that seaplane's crossing of the Atlantic, the world's first successful trans-oceanic flight. Fate Sampson entered the New York Navy Yard on 1 December 1919 for deactivation overhaul which was completed on 14 February 1921. Towed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Sampson was decommissioned on 15 June 1921. She remained inactive during the years that followed, and on 17 July 1935, was ordered scrapped in accordance with the London Treaty for the reduction of naval armaments. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 7 January 1936, and she was sold for scrap on 8 September 1936 to Boston Iron and Metal Company, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland.

The technique is performed by paratroopers and recreational parachutists alike. The technique is used to displace the energy of the body contacting the earth at high speeds. The parachutist ideally lands facing the direction of travel with feet and knees together. At the moment first contact is made with the ground, the person goes from an upright position to absorbing the impact by allowing the body to buckle and go toward a horizontal position while rotating toward the side (generally the direction with the dominant directional speed). When executed properly, this technique is capable of allowing a parachutist to survive uninjured during landing speeds that would otherwise cause severe injury or even death.  Technique  While landing under a parachute canopy, the jumper's feet strike the ground first and, immediately, he throws himself sideways to distribute the landing shock sequentially along five points of body contact with the ground: # the balls of the feet # the side of the calf # the side of the thigh # the side of the hip, or buttocks # the side of the back (latissimus dorsi muscle) During a parachute landing fall, the jumper's legs are slightly bent at the knee, the chin is tucked in, and the parachute risers may be grasped in an arm-bar protecting the face and throat, with the elbows tucked into the sides to prevent injury. Alternatively, the hands can be linked behind the neck with elbows tucked in close. The fall is executed in one of six directions‚Äîleft front, left side, left rear, right front, right side, right rear‚Äîdepending on the jumper's direction of drift, the terrain, wind, and any oscillation of the jumper. With repeated practice by jumping from a shoulder height platform onto the ground or into a sawdust pit, parachutists can learn to make smooth falls automatically, with a reflex action. Experienced jumpers can deploy a parachute landing fall naturally during an accidental fall; this has reduced or prevented injuries. The parachute landing fall is most commonly performed by jumpers who are using round canopies. Such parachutes allow less directional control and less lateral- or vertical-speed control than square parachutes. When square canopies are used, experienced jumpers can often land in a standing or short run position at a low vertical speed, so they can remain in a standing position on arriving at the ground. When arriving at greater vertical speed under a round canopy, the parachute landing fall prevents injuries to the feet, ankles, legs, hips, or upper body.

Life and work Born in Rostock, Hoppe became a leading lady of stage and films in Germany. She was born into a wealthy landowning family and was initially privately educated on her father's private estate. Later she attended school in Berlin and in Weimar, where she began to attend theatre.Obituary: Marianne Hoppe. The Independent (London), 29 October 2002. Hoppe first performed at 17 as a member of Berlin's Deutsches Theater under director Max Reinhardt. In 1935 she was hired by the controversial German actor and Director of the Prussian State Theatre under the Third Reich, Gustaf Gr√ºndgens. They were married from 1936-46, until their divorce. Speaking years after the marriage had ended Hoppe stated, \\"He was my love, but never my great love, that was work.\\" One of the characters in the film Mephisto was reportedly based on her. Hoppe made no secret of her contacts with the Nazi elite in the 1930s/40s, including being invited to dinner by Hitler.Obituary, The New York Times, 2 November 2002. Her role in Der Schimmelreiter (The Rider of the White Horse, 1934) made her famous almost overnight, while her \\"Aryan\\" face made her a darling of the Nazi elite. Later Hoppe would label this period of her life as \\"the black page in my golden book\\". During her time acting at the home of the Prussian State Theatre, the Schauspielhaus, Hoppe developed her analytical approach to acting, which she stated consisted in her \\"taking apart every sentence\\" and giving the use of language a brilliance. This method was to be associated with Hoppe throughout her working life. In 1946 her only child, Benedikt Johann Percy Gr√ºndgens, was born. Four years later after her divorce from Gr√ºndgens, Hoppe had a great success as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, and increasingly played avant- garde roles, written by authors such as Heiner M√ºller (Quartett, 1994) and Thomas Bernhard, who became her partner in private life as well. She became a favourite of the young and iconoclastic directors Claus Peymann, Robert Wilson and Frank Castorf. Death Hoppe died in Siegsdorf, Bavaria, in 2002 from natural causes, aged 93. \\"German theater has lost its queen\\", said Claus Peymann of the Berliner Ensemble, whose theatre featured Hoppe's last performance, in Bertolt Brecht's Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, in December 1997.

JSTOR It is generally classified as an early dialogue. The main characters are Socrates, the boys Lysis and Menexenus who are friends, as well as Hippothales, who is in unrequited love with Lysis and therefore, after the initial conversation, hides himself behind the surrounding listeners. Socrates proposes four possible notions regarding the true nature of loving friendship as: # Friendship between people who are similar, interpreted by Socrates as friendship between good men. # Friendship between men who are dissimilar. # Friendship between men who are neither good nor bad and good men. # Gradually emerging: friendship between those who are relatives (Œø·º∞Œ∫Œµ·øñŒøŒπ \\"not kindred\\") by the nature of their souls. Of all those options, Socrates thinks that the only logical possibility is the friendship between men who are good and men who are neither good nor bad. In the end, Socrates seems to discard all these ideas as wrong, although his para-logical refutations have strong hints of irony about them. Characters *Socrates *Ctesippus - Cousin of Menexenus. Also appears in the Euthydemus. *Hippothales - Of approximately the same age of Ctesippus. He is in love with Lysis but the other does not seem to return his feelings. *Lysis - Eldest son of Democrates I of Aexone, in his early teens. Has praise heaped on him by Hippothales but is just annoyed by it. *Menexenus - Son of Demophon, of the same age as Lysis. Probable namesake of the Menexenus. Synopsis Socrates finds himself in a wrestling school frequented by young men who, between their classes, like to discuss on various topics. Among them is one called Hippothales, who Socrates can tell right away that he is deeply in love with another boy. Upon hearing this, the young men that are present jump in to confirm Socrates' impression, adding that Hippothales is so madly in love (ŒºŒ±ŒØŒΩŒµœÑŒ±Œπ), that his singing for the unrequited love has beaten the drums of those around (204d-205a). The object of Hippothales' desires is a boy called Lysis, from whom the dialogue took its name, and Socrates asks for permission to go and speak with him directly. Hippothales accepts, and tells Socrates that all he needs to attract Lysis is to start discussing with someone, so great is the boy's interest in debates. Socrates does exactly that and Lysis approaches together with his friend Menexenus. He begins by asking Lysis, who is obviously underage, whether his parents allow him to do whatever he wishes (207d). Lysis replies that no, his parents forbid him certain things that even slaves are allowed, like driving the chariot for example. Through his method of dialectics, Socrates forces upon Lysis the conclusion that his parent's behaviour cannot simply be due to his age, as they surely trust the boy with other important things, like transcribing a document for instance. Their denials must therefore be related to his wisdom, or lack thereof (210a-210d). At this point, Socrates thinks of making a friendly pass to Hippothales, by suggesting that Lysis could learn a lot if he were to associate with him, but refrains at the last minute, seeing how timidly Hippothales was looking at them (210e). Deciding not to expose Hippothales, Socrates diverges into what will become the dialogue's main theme: the nature of a loving friendship. The exact word in the Greek text is philia (œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ±),Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus: œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ± which in the context of its time was more than just \\"friendship\\", and referred to an intimate love that developed between free men, a love that in certain cases could include the erotic. Keeping in mind this \\"desirous\\" aspect of philia is important in understanding the argument that follows, as it would probably not apply to friendship as we know it today. Because turning his questioning towards Menexenus (211d), Socrates concludes that philia is asymmetrical, and that one can love someone who does not love him in return, in contrast with animals who always requite the love of their masters (212d). Socrates continues by passing through a series of definitions on the nature of friendship, which he negates himself, even though his listeners are convinced every single time. First he supposes regarding friendship, that ‚Äúlike attracts like‚Äù, just as Homer said, and so good men will always be attracted to other good men, while bad to the bad. The problem however is that bad men cannot be friends with anyone, not even themselves, while the good are so self-fulfilled that there is nothing they need to look for in another person (214e). It must be therefore that opposites attract each other (215e), as Hesiod said, but Socrates refutes it again. So if attraction happens neither between things that are alike, nor things that are opposites, there might be something in-between the good and bad, and it's those who fall in this category that are actually the ones most likely to be attracted by the good in loving friendship (216e). These intermediaries are pushed, Socrates says, by the fear of evil, and seek the good to save themselves, just like a human body, which in itself is neither good nor bad, seeks the \\"friendship\\" of a doctor when sick (217b). Menexenus finds this last definition complete, but Socrates, upon reflection, cries in despair that both of them had been led astray (218c). First, and on a minor point, once this intermediary thing becomes a friend of the good, and considering that friendship works only among equals, then the two, good and in-between, have both become equals, which means that Socrates' definition has slipped back to the initial \\"like attracts like\\" which they have already refuted. Most importantly however, and since philia assumes the goal of betterment, the person who seeks the loving friendship of another is actually moved by the love of a certain virtue he can attain through this other (219c-d). There definition then leads to an infinite recursion, by which friendship is always towards something for the sake of another friendship, achievable through the first (·ºïŒΩŒµŒ∫Œ± ·ºëœÑŒ≠œÅŒøœÖ œÜŒØŒªŒøœÖ œÜŒØŒªŒ± ·ºîœÜŒ±ŒºŒµŒΩ Œµ·º∂ŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒ± (220e)). Socrates says their definition is like chasing ghosts (Œµ·º¥Œ¥œâŒªŒ±). Socrates ends by admitting that for all their discussion, a proper definition is still elusive. And yet, Socrates says that he considers the two boys, Lysis and Menexenus, as friends, even though he failed to define it properly. Although Socrates managed to refute all of his definitions, there are reasons to believe that his last, the one where loving friendship exists between one who is good and one who is in-between, is what Plato intended as true, a definition consistent with the one Socrates gives of eros in the Symposium. Main Themes Lysis, as portrayed in the lekythos for his son Timokleides (4th century BC). =Depiction of simple eros (sexual love) and philia (friendship) [203a‚Äì207d]= Hippothales is accused by Ctesippus, of irritating everyone around him by going overboard with annoying praises of his beloved Lysis. His displays of affection for Lysis only succeed in bugging everyone who has to listen to it. He is then asked by Socrates to sing the songs he composed for Lysis and to perform some of his poetry. Hippothales admits that he loves Lysis, but denies that he behaves in an embarrassing manner. According to Ctesippus, he is wrong because otherwise the others would not know about his unrequited love.  Hippothales composes verses for his own honor  Lysis returning his affection is the real victory for Hippothales that he achieves from singing and composing verses. Lysis is a trophy for Hippothales. If he wins Lysis' heart then he has a trophy for others to admire. It increases his social capital with the others and makes him also seem more attractive in return. However he is premature in singing for someone who does not return his affection and he only manages to make himself look foolish in doing so.  Heaping praise causes vanity and that spoils any possible chance of friendship or love  The beloved person if heaped with praise will become vain and therefore, difficult to capture. The lack of wit, extreme display of emotions and heavy praise, builds up vanity within the beloved and does not foster reverence, humility or respect. This makes it impossible to conquer somebody. The beloved becomes conceited and will think themselves too good for the lover who weeps and begs for them. The one who seeks to acquire a new friend or lover only hurts himself in doing this. The dialogue continues when Lysis says that he is loved by his parents but Socrates says on the other hand, he is limited in most of what he can do. If he were loved by someone they would allow him to do what he wants but parents dictate most of their children's decisions. Lysis is forced to let his parents, teachers and even slaves decide actions for him (example: the coachman gets to drive him around but he is not permitted to do this himself). His lack of abilities are responsible for this. They would allow him to do what he wishes if he had the abilities and skills required to successfully do these things. If he had the ability to cook tasty food for instance, then even The Great King of Asia would allow him to cook a beautiful meal over his own son even though his son is a prince. The conclusion is, that friendship can not be won by flattery. =Knowledge is the source of happiness [207d‚Äì210e]= Another important conclusion from the dialogue with Lysis is that, although his parents wish his complete happiness, they forbid him to do anything about which he has insufficient knowledge. He is allowed to do something only when his parents are sure that he can do it successfully. He is able to please his parents and make them happy when he is better at doing something than other boys are. =Reciprocal and non-reciprocal friendship [211a‚Äì213d]= The dialogue continues with Lysis only as a listener. Socrates is trying to find out what is friendship. He claims, that friendship is always reciprocal. The friendship of the lover is proof of this but he can still get angry and be filled with hatred for his beloved. And that the one who is hated or who he hates is a friend. That is in contradiction with the mentioned thesis, that friendship is reciprocal. The opposite must be true then. Friendship is non- reciprocal. Otherwise the lover cannot be happy. For example, a child who does not obey his parents and even hates them when punished. The conclusion is that people are loved by their enemies (parents) and hated by their beloved (children). Then it is not valid every time that friendship is reciprocal, and that the lover will always be loved by his friend. This is in contradiction with the premise which was given before, saying that friendship can be non- reciprocal. =Like is friend to like [213e‚Äì215c]= Bad men do not befriend either bad men nor the good ones. The former can be harmful to them by the same evil nature they both share and the latter would probably refuse them because of their evil deeds. On the other hand, the good men can have nothing to gain from others who are already good and have therefore no reason to befriend them. They are perfect and can be in love only to the extent to which they feel they need something, therefore to no extent as they are already good. =Unlike is friend to unlike [215c‚Äì216b]= The opposites attract one another. For example, the full needs the empty and empty needs the full. But this is not right in the case of human beings. For example, good vs. evil, just vs. unjust... =The presence of bad is the cause of love (philia) [216c‚Äì218c]= The search continues in an attempt to determine the first principle of friendship. The friendship must have some action that needs to be fulfilled or some benefit more precisely. Perhaps it is the good. But the friendship would not even need goodness at all unless some evil were present. If the beloved did not complete them in some way then they would not even seek friendship. =The possession of good is the goal of love (philia) [216d‚Äì219b]= The friendship must not lead us to evil. It must lead from the bad to some kind of goodness that fulfills it or else, it wouldn't even be friendship at all. The opposite is therefore not bad but good. But there are situations, in which there is no opposite but rather the middle between the two. For example, when the body thirsts it is benefitted by the good (water). When the body is in need of medicine it is benefitted by the good (doctor). The body still remains neither good nor bad in itself though. It is possible that even in the middle between good and bad, the elements of friendship can thrive, which is in contradiction with the premise that they consist in their opposite. The possession of the good is then the definition of friendship. =Love has something to gain [219c‚Äì220e]= So far we can only grasp a shadow of the real nature of friendship. If you are in love and have a friend then they must be completing some action or emotion that you were unable to achieve without them. We need the benefits of the good to escape the evil. We need health to escape illness. We need the rich with money to escape poverty. We need the education of the intelligent to prevent ignorance. Love has something to gain. It needs to benefit us somehow. =Love can not be unrequited [221a‚Äì221d]= Insufficiency is that which makes us close to each other. The friendship originates from the one benefitting from the other in some way. The beloved was in some way pleasing to the lover and that caused the love in the first place. You would not love someone if they were truly harmful to you in every possible way and provided no benefit. If friendship and love are in need of a benefit of some kind then it is impossible for either to exist without a benefit of some sort. It is therefore impossible to distinguish an object of friendship from the beloved. The beloved must be in love with the lover and love can not be unrequited because the one is fulfilling a need in the other even if unintentionally. Lysis must have been very friendly to Hippothales or pleased him visually with his body or else, brought some kind of benefit to him or else Hippothales would not have been obsessed with him. As reasoned above, the two must then be in love. =The neither good nor bad befriends the Good: aporia [159e‚Äì223a]= Like can not be friend with the like because there is nothing to be gained from either. Someone who is already fulfilled and good would not need anything else to make them fulfilled and good. They have nothing to gain. The evil can not be friends with the good as they are harmful to both them and themselves. This creates a paradox where neither the truly good nor the truly evil can befriend one another. This leaves last the notion that the neither good nor bad are the friends to the good as they are in need of the good. They benefit from the relationship in that they gain the wisdom and the \\"good.\\" They search for wisdom and truth. It benefits them and makes them whole like a body in need of medicine.

His full name and title was H.M. al- Nasir-li-Dinullah Ahmad bin al-Mutawakkil 'Alallah Yahya, Imam and Commander of the Faithful, and King of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of the Yemen. Ahmad's ruthless, arbitrary and inconsistent rule made him the subject of a coup attempt, frequent assassination attempts and eventually lead to the downfall of the kingdom shortly after his death. His enemies ranged from ambitious family members to forward-looking pan-Arabists and Republicans and from them he was given the name \\"Ahmad the devil.\\" (Subscription required.) He remained surprisingly popular among his subjects, particularly the northern tribesmen from whom he had the name \\"Big Turban.\\" (Subscription required.) For his remarkable ability to narrowly escape numerous assassination attempts, he was known as al-Djinn. (Hereafter \\"Clark.\\") Like his father, Ahmad was profoundly conservative, but nevertheless forged alliances with the Soviet Union, Communist China and the Republic of Egypt, all of which provided economic and military aid to the kingdom. These alliances were largely driven by his desire to expel the British from southern Yemen and recover the Aden Protectorate as part of Greater Yemen. In the end he turned against Egypt, which after his death supported a republican coup against his son and successor.  Biography Youth and character= Ahmad bin Yahya was the oldest son of Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, of the Hamid al-Din branch of the al-Qasimi dynasty. Yahya had been imam of the Zaidi sect of Shia Islam practiced by tribes in northern Yemen, from 1904, when he succeeded his father. Yahya had assumed the title of King of Yemen on the breakup of the Ottoman rule over the country in 1918. From Ahmad's youth he was notable for his strikingly ferocious appearance. He was short and stocky and had prominently bulging eyes, which some claimed he induced. Although he wrote poetry from his youth, he was known for his explosive temper. Stories circulated that when he was a student of law, he confronted fellow students at knife-point to swear to support him one day as Imam. (Hereafter \\"Dresch.\\") Coincidentally, he shared the same birthday as his father, the previous Imam. = Early career and 1948 coup = Palace of Imam Ahmed Hamid al-Din in Salh District, Taiz. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ahmad assisted his father in putting together his kingdom through strategy, diplomacy, tribal warfare and intrigue. Ahmad was appointed governor of Ta'izz from 1918 to 1948. In 1927 he was named wali ahad, effectively the crown prince. From his father, Ahmad learned a deep distrust for the new and a profound aversion to any change in medieval methods of governance. While governor he surrounded himself with reformers, however.Dresch, p. 78. He always tried to keep the factions close to him but his volatile temper often betrayed him. In 1944 at his court in Ta'izz, he was heard to exclaim, \\"I pray God I do not die before I colour my sword here with the blood of these modernists.\\" The outburst caused Ahmad Muhammad Nu'man, Muhammad al-Zubayri and other future \\"liberals\\" (in the Yemen sense of Yemeni independents and moderate reformers) to quit his court and flee to Aden.Dresch, p. 53. There they founded the Free Yemeni Movement. His arbitrary and erratic behavior, however, did not diminish his popularity in Ta'izz. While governor he razed the tomb of Ibn Alwan without any protest from Shafi'i clerics. He was not a doctrinaire Zaidi, however. In 1952 he imprisoned in the notorious Hajjah dungeons Zaidis who attacked a cleric in Ibb for a sermon praising the three caliphs before Ali. Although his soldiers were Zaidi and the population of Ta'izz Shaff'i, a British observer found \\"there is almost universal loyalty to the Yemen, if not to the person of the Imam ...\\"Dresch, pp. 68-69. In February 1948 Yahya, three of his sons and his chief adviser were assassinated in a coup, in which the religious leader Abdullah bin Ahmed al-Wazir was proclaimed Imam. Yahya's son (and Ahmad's brother) Ibrahim bin Yahya was appointed head of the \\"constitutional government.\\" Ibrahim had been in open revolt against his father for a year having fled and joined a group called \\"Free Yemenites\\" in the Aden Protectorate in 1946. (Subscription required.) The plan to simultaneously murder Ahmad in Ta'izz failed, and he advanced on Hajjah where loyal tribes supplied his forces. Abdullah was established in Sana'a. Yahya's third son, Hasan Hamid al-Din, then governor of the southern province of Ibb but beloved by the northern tribes, rallied those forces to his brother Ahmad's cause, entered Sana'a and ended the short-lived revolutionary government. Ahmad rewarded him with the offices of prime minister and governor of Sana'a. With the support of the northern tribes as well as Ahmad's Shafi'i stronghold in Ta'izz, the conspirators were rounded up in four weeks. Most were beheaded. The new Imam Ahmad, all-Nasir li-Din Allah (\\"the Protector of God's Religion\\") would rule from Ta'izz, while Sana'a was given over to looters.Dresch, pp. 56-67.Clark, pp. 55-56. Unaffiliated liberals were also swept up in the net. About thirty were beheaded, while the rest were left in dungeons. Most were released in two years, often after writing obsequious flattery of the imam, but others were left in prison for much longer.Dresch, pp. 66. =His rule as Imam= As king Ahmad was more open to foreign contact than his father, but he never allowed free intercourse with other nations. His rule was autocratic and conservative; he never brooked suggestions. It was said that every detail, no matter how small or trivial, had to be approved by the Imam, even for a government truck to be moved in Ta'izz or mules to receive fodder. A governor of Aden reported, \\"Everything hangs on the King's nod. Yet his situation is pathetic, for he knows he has no friends.\\"Dresch, p. 67. To the outside world, the Imam was virtually unknown, noted only for seemingly odd conduct. In 1950 a wire service report noted when he and his son Muhammad al-Badr married two sisters, nurses at the only hospital in Sana'a. (Subscription required.) Although his father had banned aircraft after a fatal accident, Ahmad was fascinated by them and on taking the throne bought two DC-3s and another in 1951. All the planes, however, were at the personal disposal of the Imam. The Swedish crew were terrified of his inconsistent orders.Dresch, pp. 66-67. The museum which was once his palace (now no longer open to the public) supposedly contains his \\"bizarre collection of hundreds of identical bottles of eau de cologne, Old Spice and Christian Dior, an electronic bed, a child's KLM handbag, projectors, films, guns, ammunition and swords ... passports, personalized Swiss watches and blood-stained clothes.\\"Clark, p. 56. His mood swings and unpredictable behavior had several sources. Chief among them was his addiction to a mix of drugs, chiefly morphine, which he took for his chronic rheumatism. He lived in fear of sudden death and divine retribution. He was subject to beliefs in the supernatural, consulted astrologers and often would succumb to \\"mystical crises\\" during which he would fast and cut himself from the world for weeks. His one abiding policy guide as Imam (aside from his reactionary position on government) was to drive the British from Aden and recover the protectorate for \\"Greater Yemen\\" as his father saw it. Ahmad also believed Britain was behind the plot that killed his father.Dresch, p. 62. Aden was also a center for the Free Yemen movement, a collection of intellectuals and republican-leaning nationalists expatriates from the north.Dresch, p. 70 Rhetoric turned to border skirmishes and on March 26, 1955 Ahmad charged Britain with having killed a number of Yemenis in a \\"brutal attack\\" in southern Yemen. Ahmad became further alarmed by the British plan to federate 18 petty sheikdoms and sultanates within the protectorate, which would consolidate territory under British protection which Yemen still claimed. (Subscription required.) Imam Ahmad with King Saud and retinues The tensions with British Aden caused Ahmad to overcome his antipathy for Saudi Arabia, which he also received from his father.The Saudi's became Imam Yahya's rival for the Emirate of Asir. After a border war in 1934, Yahya was forced to concede Asir to Al Saud by the Treaty of Taif. A more fundamental cause of friction was the clash between the severely orthodox Wahhabism of the tribes that formed the basis of Al Saud power and the Zaidi sect of Shi'a practiced by the tribesmen who supported Yahya. See (Subscription required.) In 1955 Yemen began talks with a view towards entering a military pact with Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia. The warming of relations coincided with a Saudi need for foreign workers to service its expanding oil industry, and in 1955 the Saudi government decreed that Yemenis could enter without work permits. Egypt and Syria signed their pact for a new Arab military alliance on March 3, 1955. (Subscription required.) Egypt's interest was in putting together a pan-Arab league to counter the pro-Western tilt of the recent Iraq-Turkey pact (which, with the addition of Pakistan and Great Britain would become known as the Baghdad Pact). Three days later from their respective capitals Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia issued a joint decree announcing an agreement to \\"strengthen the Arab structure politically, militarily and economically.\\" (Subscription required.) Egypt wanted the remaining four members of the Arab League (Lebanon, Jordan, Libya and Yemen) but Lebanon with commercial interests in the West and the Arab world vacillated and Jordan was disqualified by the terms of British participation in her defense. By the end of March Egyptian diplomatic sources conceded that Syria, under diplomatic pressure from Turkey and Iraq, was refusing to move forward on the plans for joint defense and might decide to withdraw if the agreement continued to prohibit signatories from entering into any defense treaty with any non-Arab nation. Egypt was able to save face, when, on March 26, 1955, Prime Minister Hasan announced in Cairo that Yemen would join the Egypt-Syria-Saudi Pact and participate in the unscheduled premier's conference in Cairo to conclude the pact. In 1955 a coup by a group of officers and two of Ahmad's brothers was crushed. In April 1956 Ahmad bin Yahya signed a mutual defense pact with Egypt, involving a unified military command. =The king's relationship with the Jews of Yemen= Imam Ahmad was unique as far as monarchs are concerned and their relationship to their Jewish subjects, such that during the height of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict in 1948, he did not shy away from permitting his Jewish subjects to immigrate to Palestine.Deborah Cohen,  øOlim besa øarah, Ben-Zvi Institute: Jerusalem 1994, pp. 57‚Äì62 (Hebrew). In May of 1949, Imam Ahmad announced that any Jew who is interested in leaving Yemen is permitted to do so, on three conditions: that he reimburse any debts, first and foremost, the poll-tax known as the jizya; that he sell his property; and that if he were a skilled artisan, that he teach his profession to local Yemeni Arab citizens.Tuvia Sulami, Political vs. religious motivations behind Imam Ahmad's decision to permit Jewish emigration in 1949 (Lecture notes delivered at the United Nations building in New-York, on 4 June 2018) The Imam's decision was met with surprise, both in terms of its religious and political implications. Following his announcement, there immediately commenced a mass-exodus of Jews, dubbed \\"The Immigration 'On Eagles' Wings',\\" which continued from June 1949 until September 1950, during which time some 50,000 people came up to Israel, including the immigrants from December of 1948. The Imam did not make the Jews' departure contingent upon their paying any sort of gratis or ransom money, other than legal and accepted fees: the payment of the poll-tax (al-jizya), assessed against the menfolk until their departure; as also the payment of a fee upon their exit from Yemen, and the payment of a customs duty on property that was exported out of Yemen. Jews who complained before the Imam that they were unable to sell their property were given fair advisory opinions as to how they might dispense of their property and make good their journey.Shalom Mansura, The Magic Carpet Immigration: Description of the Great Immigration of Yemenite Jewry, Bnei-Brak 2003, p. 130 (Hebrew) =Death and immediate aftermath= On September 19, 1962 Ahmad died in his sleep. Ahmad bin Yahya's oldest son, Muhammad al-Badr was proclaimed Imam and King and took the title of al-Mansur, but a week later rebels shelled his residence, Dar al-Bashair, in the Bir al-Azab district of Sana'a, and set up a republic. In the 1962 coup imam Muhammad al-Badr was deposed by a group of nationalist officers. The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) was proclaimed under the leadership of Abdullah al-Sallal.Paul Dresch, A history of modern Yemen, Cambridge 2000, pp. 28-88 .

In computer software development, the business rules approach is a development methodology where rules are in a form that is used by, but does not have to be embedded in, business process management systems. The business rules approach formalizes an enterprise's critical business rules in a language that managers and technologists understand. Business rules create an unambiguous statement of what a business does with information to decide a proposition. The formal specification becomes information for process and rules engines to run. Advantages The adoption of business rules adds another tier to systems that automate business processes. Compared to traditional systems, this approach has the following major advantages, * lowers the cost incurred in the modification of business logic * shortens development time * rules are externalized and easily shared among multiple applications * changes can be made faster and with less risk Business rules represent a natural step in the application of computer technology aimed at enhancing productivity in the workplace. Automated business processes that have business logic embedded inside often take substantial time to change, and such changes can be prone to errors. And in a world where the life cycle of business models has greatly shortened, it has become increasingly critical to be able to adapt to changes in external environments promptly. These needs are addressed by a business rules approach. Business rules enhance business agility. And the manageability of business processes also increases as rules become more accessible. Technical details The programs designed specifically to run business rules are called rule engines. More complete systems that support the writing, deployment and management of business rules are called business rules management systems (BRMSs). Many commercial rule engines provide the Rete algorithm, a proprietary algorithm that embodies many of the principles of Rete. However, there are other execution algorithms such as the sequential algorithm (ILOG and Blaze Advisor terminology), algorithms for evaluating decision tables/trees, and algorithms tuned for hierarchical XML. The Rete algorithm is a stateful pattern matching algorithm designed to minimize the evaluation of repetitive tests across many objects/attributes and many rules. Different fields of usage are best for Rete-based and non-Rete- based execution algorithms. For simple stateless applications with minimal sharing of conditions across rules, a non-Rete-based execution algorithm (such as the sequential algorithm) may be preferable. For evaluating decision tables and trees, an algorithm that exploits the hierarchical relationships between the rule conditions may perform better than a simple Rete or sequential algorithm tuned for discrete rules. Business rules can be expressed in conventional programming languages or natural languages. In some commercial BRMSs rules can also be expressed in user-friendly rule forms such as decision tables and decision trees. Provided with a suitable interface to design or edit decision tables or trees, it is possible for business users to check or change rules directly, with minimal IT involvement. When rules are expressed in natural language, it is necessary to first define a vocabulary that contains words and expressions corresponding to business objects and conditions and the operations involving them. To make the rules executable by a rule engine, it is also necessary to implement the operations and conditions in a programming language. With a defined and implemented vocabulary, it is relatively easy to write rules in a BRMS. Changes can also be made quickly as long as they can be expressed in the existing vocabulary. If not, the vocabulary must be expanded accordingly. Separating the vocabulary from the logic makes it possible for business rules to be modeled, with the business user mapping their business logic and with IT integrating data and the generated code into the target application. Business rules are also key to the enterprise decision management approach to decision automation. Increasingly, business rules are also viewed as a critical component of business process management solutions because of the need to ensure flexibility.  Relation to database management  As argued by Christopher J. Date, business rules translate into data integrity constraints when one thinks in terms of the relational model of database management. Thus, a true RDBMS could be thought of in terms of a declarative business rules engine with added data management capability. However, business rules need not only be regarded as constraints. They can also be used to specify constructive business policies, such as \\"preferred clients get a discount of 10%\\". Used in this way, business rules are like SQL queries, rather than data integrity constraints.  Relation to business process management  Some analysts believe the combination of business rules technology with business process management offers an agile approach to workflow and enterprise integration. BPM and BR software support business goals by managing and running business processes and business rules in separate yet complementary ways. A business process is often a complex map of flow controls. It might have many subprocesses, decisions and while loops. Wherever a decision or while loop appears, business rules can evaluate the data provided by the process and control the basis for change in flows. Often there are separate reasons for updates to processes or rules. New regulations or business strategies may affect the rules without changing core business processes. New applications or procedures might change the business process. In either case, a composite approach to rules and processes can be very flexible. As more and more BPM vendors either add business rules engines to their BPM engines or OEM business rules management systems, business rules seems to be becoming a subset of BPM.

London Cabmen's Shelter in Russell Square. London Cabmen's Shelter in Wellington Place. London Cabmen's Shelter in Kensington Road, W8. The Cabmen's Shelter Fund was established in London, England, in 1875 to run shelters for the drivers of hansom cabs and later hackney carriages (taxicabs).\\"Cabman's shelters, London ‚Äì Victorian survivors on London's streets\\", Urban75, April 2006. By law, cab drivers could not leave the cab stand while their cab was parked there. This made it very difficult for them to obtain hot meals and could be unpleasant in bad weather. If they drove to a pub to buy food then they would have to pay somebody to look after their cab while they were inside, otherwise it was likely to be stolen. In addition they would be tempted to drink alcohol on the job.Tom Skipp, \\"Where London cabbies spend time off the clock\\", photo gallery, BBC, 29 November 2016. The Earl of Shaftesbury and other worthies therefore took it upon themselves to set up a charity to construct and run shelters at major cab stands.Will Self, \\"Fare Grounds\\", blog, Travel, The New York Times, 28 November 2012. These shelters were small green huts, which were not allowed to be larger than a horse and cart, as they stood on the public highway. Between 1875 and 1914, 61 of these buildings were built around London, the first being on Acacia Road in St John's Wood.Illustrated London News, January 1975. Most were staffed by an attendant who sold food and (non-alcoholic) drink to the cabbies and were provided with a kitchen in which the attendant could cook this food and also food provided by the cabbies themselves. The attendant was not generally paid, but was expected to make an income from these sales. The shelters were also provided with seats and tables and books and newspapers, most of them donated by the publishers or other benefactors. Most could accommodate ten to thirteen men. Gambling, drinking and swearing were strictly forbidden. Thirteen of the shelters still exist and are still run by the Cabmen's Shelter Fund. All are now Grade II listed buildings.

It is down the line from and is situated between and either or depending on the route. It is a busy commuter station with services to several London termini (Cannon Street, Charing Cross and London Bridge) and destinations to other parts of south-east London and the south-east of England (Orpington and Sevenoaks on the South Eastern Main Line, and Dartford and Gravesend on the Dartford Loop Line). It is in Travelcard Zone 3 and very close to Hither Green Traction Maintenance Depot (TMD), Grove Park Traction and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot, and Grove Park Safety Training Centre. The station straddles the Prime Meridian, which is marked across the roof of the pedestrian tunnel forming the main entrance. The station and all trains are operated by Southeastern.  History  Station signage in use by British Railways Southern Region Hither Green station was opened on 1 June 1895, by the South Eastern Railway (SER). It was built at Hither Green junction which had been formed some thirty years earlier. Originally there was a booking hall in Springbank Road which was built to serve the St. Germans Estate. The red brick gateposts are still visible outside the site, which was occupied by a timber merchant for many years, but is now being redeveloped for residential use. The original stationmaster's house survives, at 69 Springbank Road. The main station building was built in Staplehurst Road. Since 1974, access to the new booking hall, located between platforms 4 and 5, has been up a ramp from a foot tunnel which runs between Staplehurst Road and Maythorne Cottages. In 1899 the SER entered a working relationship known as the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, which managed the station until 1 January 1923, when it became part of the Southern Railway. The Southern Region of British Rail was responsible from nationalisation in 1948 until the regions were completely abolished at the end of 1992. Accidents and incidents *On 4 September 1934, two freight trains collided at Hither Green. *On 5 November 1967, the Hither Green rail crash occurred. An express train from to derailed between and Hither Green station, close to where the railway crosses St. Mildred's Road, due to a broken rail. Forty-nine passengers were killed.  Facilities and exits  There are two exits from Hither Green Station: Fernbrook Road and Springbank Road. The Fernbrook Road exit may be used to reach Hither Green village. There is also a passageway leading out to Maythorne Cottages, which links with Nightingale Grove. The Springbank Road exit may be used for roads to the west of the station including Hither Green Lane. The exit towards the south east end of platform 4 is an exit for authorised personnel only via Hither Green Traction Maintenance Depot (TMD). While the station has a ticket office, it is not open at all times. Ticket machines are available at all times at the Fernbrook Road exit, between platforms 4 and 5, and - for the Springbank Road exit - halfway along on platform 1. There is a coffee shop on platform 5, and a newsagent near the main ticket office, but again these are not open at all times. The station has toilets (open only when the station is manned).

The tunnel is under the jurisdiction of the New York City Department of Transportation, and carries one lane of northbound car traffic from East 33rd Street to East 40th Street; from 40th Street north, traffic must follow the Park Avenue Viaduct around Grand Central Terminal to 46th Street. The vertical clearance is . The IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, carrying the , runs parallel to the Park Avenue Tunnel in two tunnels below it. History The tunnel once carried the New York and Harlem Railroad and later, that company's streetcar line. It was then called the Murray Hill Tunnel. The tunnel was originally built as an open rock cut, completed in 1837, after which the NY&H; Railroad was opened as far as Yorkville, to 85th Street. In 1850, the cut was roofed over, using granite stringers from the original railroad bed south of 14th Street, thus creating the present tunnel. Due to the construction of Grand Central Terminal and the removal of tracks, the north end was reconstructed for a steeper approach. Prior to August 3, 2008, the tunnel carried two-way traffic, one lane for each direction; on that date, it was reconfigured to increase safety for pedestrians crossing Park Avenue at 33rd Street. In February 2017, the Park Avenue Tunnel was closed for a $24 million rehabilitation. It reopened in 2019. Art installations In 2013, the tunnel was open to pedestrians for the first time in coordination with the annual Summer Streets event, which shuts down part of Park Avenue to vehicular traffic between 7:00 am and 1:00 pm for three Sundays every August.

They are divided into two subfamilies with eight genera and about 150 species in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Australia and North and South America. The Zamiaceae, sometimes known as zamiads, are perennial, evergreen, and dioecious. They have subterranean to tall and erect, usually unbranched, cylindrical stems, and stems clad with persistent leaf bases (in Australian genera). Their leaves are simply pinnate, spirally arranged, and interspersed with cataphylls. The leaflets are sometimes dichotomously divided. The leaflets occur with several sub-parallel, dichotomously-branching longitudinal veins; they lack a mid rib. Stomata occur either on both surfaces or undersurface only. Their roots have small secondary roots. The coralloid roots develop at the base of the stem at or below the soil surface. Male and female sporophylls are spirally aggregated into determinate cones that grow along the axis. Female sporophylls are simple, appearing peltate, with a barren stipe and an expanded and thickened lamina with 2 (rarely 3 or more) sessile ovules inserted on the inner (axis facing) surface and directed inward. The seeds are angular, with the inner coat hardened and the outer coat fleshy. They are often brightly colored, with 2 cotyledons. One subfamily, the Encephalartoideae, is characterized by spirally arranged sporophylls (rather than spirally orthostichous), non-articulate leaflets and persistent leaf bases. It is represented in Australia, with two genera and 40 species. As with all cycads, members of the Zamiaceae are poisonous, producing poisonous glycosides known as cycasins.

The purpose of an abstract of judgment is to create a public record and create a lien or claim if necessary on any real estate property owned or later acquired by the defendant located in the county in which the abstract of judgment is recorded. If the loser does not pay the judgment voluntarily then the winner can force a sheriff's sale of any property to collect. There are several problems: 1) to find the county where the loser owns real estate property; 2) the probability that there are secured loans, tax liens and/or other judgments that come ahead of the judgment lien; 3) the possibility that the loser/debtor may go bankrupt and avoid paying the debt. United Kingdom An abstract is a brief summary of a judicial judgment, usually written by a Barrister or academic for publication in law reports. Abstracts are of particular use in legal research because they condense the essential points of long, complex judgments into a few paragraphs. A researcher can use abstracts to investigate how relevant a particular case is to the issue at hand, and hence to decide whether he or she should go on to read the entire judgment. United States The term \\"abstract of judgment\\" may be used in a generic sense to describe a condensed summary of a court case, but it is chiefly used in a technical sense to describe a document produced by a court which describes the judgment rendered in a case. =Criminal law= An abstract of judgment is a clerical document containing a summary of court proceedings which may be useful though not conclusive in proving a prior conviction for the purposes of enhancement. United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, 405 F.3d 352, 357 - 58 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding a sentencing court could not rely on an abstract of judgment to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies to enhance a sentence); United States v. Navidad-Marcos, 367 F.3d 903, 908 - 09 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding an abstract of judgment did not \\"unequivocally\\" establish that a defendant entered a guilty plea); see also United States. v. Price, 366 U.S. App. D.C. 166, 409 F.3d 436, 445 (D.C. Cir. 2005). =Property law= In some states, such as Texas, an abstract of judgment is a specific type of document provided either by the court clerk or by an attorney which is used to prove that a judgment has been rendered. The abstract may then be filed in another jurisdiction, where it constitutes notice of a \\"judgment lien\\" on the debtor's real property, thereby preventing the transfer of that property until the judgment has been paid. This process was described by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1987: :See Tex. Prop. Code Ann. ¬ß 52.002 (1984) (directing clerk to issue an abstract of the judgment \\"on application of a person in whose favor a judgment is rendered\\"; no exception for superseded judgments); Thulemeyer v. Jones, 37 Tex. 560, 571 (1872). The bond's only effect would be to prevent Pennzoil from executing the judgment and obtaining Texaco's property. Pennzoil Co. v.

People of the Nordic type are mostly found in Northwestern Europe and Northern Europe, particularly among populations such as Anglos, Germanic peoples, Balts, Baltic Finns, Northern French, and certain Celts and Slavs.:File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpgGrant, Madison (1921) The Passing of the Great Race, New York: Scribner's Sons. p.167 The physical traits of the Nordics were described as light eyes, light skin, tall stature, and dolichocephalic skull; the psychological traits as truthful, equitable, competitive, naive, reserved, and individualistic.Gunther, Hans F. K., The Racial Elements of European History, translated by G. C. Wheeler, Methuen & Co. LTD, London, 1927, p. 3 Other supposed \\"Caucasian sub-races\\" were the Alpine race, Dinaric race, Iranid race, East Baltic race, and the Mediterranean race. In the early 20th century, beliefs that the Nordic race constituted the superior branch of the Caucasian race gave rise to the ideology of Nordicism. Background The Russian-born French anthropologist Joseph Deniker initially proposed \\"nordique\\" (meaning simply \\"northern\\") as an \\"ethnic group\\" (a term that he coined). He defined nordique by a set of physical characteristics: the concurrence of somewhat wavy hair, light eyes, reddish skin, tall stature and a dolichocephalic skull. Of six 'Caucasian' groups Deniker accommodated four into secondary ethnic groups, all of which he considered intermediate to the Nordic: Northwestern, Sub-Nordic, Vistula and Sub-Adriatic, respectively.Deniker, J. - Les Races de l'Europe (1899);The Races of Man (London: Walter Scott Ltd., 1900);Les Races et les Peuples de la Terre (Masson et Cie, Paris, 1926)Deniker (J.) \\"Essai d'une classification des races humaines, bas√©e uniquement sur les caract√®res physiques\\". Bulletins de la Soci√©t√© d'anthropologie de Paris. Volume 12 Num√©ro 12. 1889. pp. 320-336. The notion of a distinct northern European race was also rejected by several anthropologists on craniometric grounds. German anthropologist Rudolf Virchow attacked the claim following a study of craniometry, which gave surprising results according to contemporary scientific racist theories on the \\"Aryan race.\\" During the 1885 Anthropology Congress in Karlsruhe, Virchow denounced the \\"Nordic mysticism,\\" while Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated that the people of Europe, be they German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a \\"mixture of various races,\\" furthermore declaring that the \\"results of craniology\\" led to \\"struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race\\".Andrea Orsucci, \\"Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870‚Äì1914) , Cromohs, 1998 Ripley (1899) American economist William Z. Ripley purported to define a \\"Teutonic race\\" in his book The Races of Europe (1899).William Z. Ripley, in The Races of Europe: A Sociological Study (New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1899) He divided Europeans into three main subcategories: Teutonic (teutonisch), Alpine and Mediterranean. According to Ripley the \\"Teutonic race\\" resided in Scandinavia, northern France, northern Germany, the Baltic states and East Prussia, northern Poland, northwest Russia, Great Britain, Ireland, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe, and was typified by light hair, light skin, blue eyes, tall stature, a narrow nose, and slender body type. It was Ripley who popularized this idea of three biological European races. Ripley borrowed Deniker's terminology of Nordic (he had previously used the term \\"Teuton\\"); his division of the European races relied on a variety of anthropometric measurements, but focused especially on their cephalic index and stature. Compared to Deniker, Ripley advocated a simplified racial view and proposed a single Teutonic race linked to geographic areas where Nordic-like characteristics predominate, and contrasted these areas to the boundaries of two other types, Alpine and Mediterranean, thus reducing the 'caucasoid branch of humanity' to three distinct groups. Early 20th century theories \\"Expansion of the Pre-Teutonic Nordics\\" ‚Äî Map from The Passing of the Great Race by Madison Grant showing early migrations of Nordics. By 1902 the German archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna identified the original Aryans (Proto-Indo-Europeans) with the north German Corded Ware culture, an argument that gained in currency over the following two decades. He placed the Indo-European Urheimat in Schleswig-Holstein, arguing that they had expanded across Europe from there. By the early 20th century this theory was well established, though far from universally accepted. Sociologists were soon using the concept of a \\"blond race\\" to model the migrations of the supposedly more entrepreneurial and innovative components of European populations. By the early 20th century, Ripley's tripartite Nordic/Alpine/Mediterranean model was well established. Most 19th century race-theorists like Arthur de Gobineau, Otto Ammon, Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Houston Stewart Chamberlain preferred to speak of \\"Aryans,\\" \\"Teutons,\\" and \\"Indo-Europeans\\" instead of \\"Nordic Race\\". The British German racialist Houston Stewart Chamberlain considered the Nordic race to be made up of Celtic and Germanic peoples, as well as some Slavs. Chamberlain called those people Celt-Germanic peoples, and his ideas would influence the ideology of Nordicism and Nazism. \\"Expansion of the Teutonic Nordics and Slavic Alpines\\" ‚Äî Map from Passing of the Great Race by Madison Grant showing the expansion of the Nordics and Alpines in Europe from the 1st century BC to the 11th century AD. Madison Grant, in his 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race, took up Ripley's classification. He described a \\"Nordic\\" or \\"Baltic\\" type: > \\"long skulled, very tall, fair skinned, with blond, brown or red hair and > light coloured eyes. The Nordics inhabit the countries around the North and > Baltic Seas and include not only the great Scandinavian and Teutonic groups, > but also other early peoples who first appear in southern Europe and in Asia > as representatives of Aryan language and culture.\\"Madison Grant, \\"The > Passing of the Great Race\\", Scribner's Sons, 1921, p. 167 According to Grant, the \\"Alpine race\\", shorter in stature, darker in colouring, with a rounder head, predominated in Central and Eastern Europe through to Turkey and the Eurasian steppes of Central Asia and Southern Russia. The \\"Mediterranean race\\", with dark hair and eyes, aquiline nose, swarthy complexion, moderate-to-short stature, and moderate or long skull was said to be prevalent in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Only in the 1920s did a strong partiality for \\"Nordic\\" begin to reveal itself, and for a while the term was used almost interchangeably with Aryan. Later, however, Nordic would not be co-terminous with Aryan, Indo-European or Germanic.Anna Bramwell. 1985. Blood and Soil: Richard Walther Darr√© and Hitler's \\"Green Party\\". Abbotsbrook, England: The Kensal Press. , p. 39&40 For example, the later Nazi minister for Food, Richard Walther Darr√©, who had developed a concept of the German peasantry as a Nordic race, used the term 'Aryan' to refer to the tribes of the Iranian plains. In Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes (Racial Science of the German People), published 1922, Hans F. K. G√ºnther identified five principal European races instead of three, adding the East Baltic race (related to the Alpine race) and Dinaric race (related to the Nordic race) to Ripley's categories. This work was influential in Ewald Banse's publication of Die Rassenkarte von Europa in 1925 which combined research by Deniker, Ripley, Grant, Otto Hauser, G√ºnther, Eugen Fischer and Gustav Kraitschek.Gunther, Hans F. K., The Racial Elements of European History, translated by G. C. Wheeler, Methuen & Co. LTD, London, 1927 Coon (1939) Carleton Coon in his book of 1939 The Races of Europe subdivided the Nordic race into three main types, \\"Corded\\", \\"Danubian\\" and \\"Keltic\\", besides a \\"Neo-Danubian\\" type\\"de-Corded Nordic (and hence Danubian) prototype brachycephalized by Ladogan admixture.\\" Plate 31: Neo-Danubians and a variety of Nordic types altered by Upper Palaeolithic or Alpine admixture. \\"Exotic Nordics\\" are morphologically Nordic types that occur in places distant from the northwestern European center of Nordic concentration.examples from eastern Russia, Albania, Portugal and North Africa; Plate 30: Exotic Nordics Coon takes the Nordics to be a partially depigmented branch of the greater Mediterranean racial stock. This theory was also supported by Coon's mentor Earnest Albert Hooton, who in the same year published Twilight of Man, which notes: \\"The Nordic race is certainly a depigmented offshoot from the basic long-headed Mediterranean stock. It deserves separate racial classification only because its blond hair (ash or golden), its pure blue or grey eyes\\".Twilight of Man, Earnest Albert Hooton, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1939 p. 77.Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes & Noble, 1963. P. 57. Coon suggests that the Nordic type emerged as a result of a mixture of \\"the Danubian Mediterranean strain with the later Corded element\\". Hence his two main Nordic types show Corded and Danubian predominance, respectively . The third \\"Keltic\\" or \\"Hallstatt\\" type Coon takes to have emerged in the European Iron Age, in Central Europe, where it was subsequently mostly replaced, but \\"found a refuge in Sweden and in the eastern valleys of southern Norway.\\" Coon further recognizes the following terminology of earlier authors: *Fenno-Nordic, \\"a hypothetical eastern branch of the Nordic race\\" *Noric, \\"a blond, Dinaricized Nordic\\" *Osterdal type, \\"the classic Iron Age Nordic, as found today in the eastern valleys of Norway\\" *Sub-Nordic, \\"a racial group which would fall partly in the East Baltic and partly in the Neo-Danubian categories\\" *Tr√∏nderlagen type or Tr√∏nder type, \\"a variety of Nordic with an excessive Corded element and Upper Palaeolithic mixture\\" *Anglo-Saxon type, \\"a sub-type of Nordic which contains unreduced Upper Palaeolithic mixture\\" Post-World War II theories Polish encyclopedia used this image as example of the \\"Nordic race\\" The depigmentation theory received notable support from later anthropologists, thus in 1947 Melville Jacobs noted: \\"To many physical anthropologists Nordic means a group with an especially high percentage of blondness, which represent a depigmentated Mediterranean\\".Outline of Physical Anthropology, 1947, p. 49. In her work Races of Man (1963, 2nd Ed. 1965) Sonia Mary Cole went further to argue that the Nordic race belongs to the \\"brunette Mediterranean\\" Caucasoid division but that it differs only in its higher percentage of blonde hair and light eyes. The Harvard anthropologist Claude Alvin Villee, Jr. also was a notable proponent of this theory, writing: \\"The Nordic division, a partially depigmised branch of the Mediterranean group.\\"Biology, 1972, Saunders, p. 786. Collier's Encyclopedia as late as 1984 contains an entry for this theory, citing anthropological support.Collier's Encyclopedia, Vol. 9, William Darrach Halsey, Emanuel Friedman, Macmillan Educational Co., 1984, p. 412. The Swedish anthropologist Bertil Lundman introduced the term \\"Nordid\\" to describe the Nordic race in his book The Races and Peoples of Europe (1977) as: Some forensic scientists, pathologists and anthropologists up to the 1990s continued to use the tripartite division of Caucasoids: Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean, based on their cranial anthropometry. The anthropologist Wilton M. Krogman for example identified Nordic racial crania in his work \\"The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine\\" (1986) as being \\"dolichochranic\\".\\"The Human Skeleton in Forensic Medicine\\", Wilton Marion Krogman, M. Ya≈üar ƒ∞≈ücan, C.C. Thomas, 1986, p. 270, p. 489. A 1990s study by Ulrich Mueller found that depigmentation of Nordic peoples around the Baltic Sea likely occurred due to vitamin D deficiency amongst peoples living there 10,000‚Äì30,000 years ago who had a lack of access to vitamin D foods, such as dairy products at the time. Depigmentation allowed greater amount of ultraviolet B light to be absorbed through the skin to produce vitamin D.R. Hegselmann, Ulrich Mueller, Klaus G. Troitzsch.

The Rhynie chert is an Early Devonian sedimentary deposit exhibiting extraordinary fossil detail or completeness (a Lagerst√§tte). It is exposed near the village of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland; a second unit, the Windyfield chert, is located some 700 m away. The Rhynie chert contains exceptionally preserved plant, fungus, lichen and animal material preserved in place by an overlying volcanic deposit. The bulk of the fossil bed consists of primitive plants (which had water-conducting cells and sporangia, but no true leaves), along with arthropods, lichens, algae and fungi. This fossil bed is remarkable for two reasons. First, the age of the site (Pragian, Early Devonian, formed about ) places it at an early stage in the colonisation of land. Second, these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. Stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material, and the breathing apparatus of trigonotarbids‚Äîof the class Arachnida‚Äî(known as book lungs) can be seen in cross-sections. Fungal hyphae can be seen entering plant material, acting as decomposers and mycorrhizal symbionts. Location The bed is under at least 1 metre of overburden, in a small field near the village of Rhynie, so is effectively inaccessible to collectors; besides which, the site is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A second unit, the Windyfield chert, is some 700 m from the Rhynie. The Rhynie chert extends for at least 80 m along strike and 90 m down-dip. History of research The chert was discovered by William Mackie while mapping the western margin of the Rhynie basin in 1910‚Äì1913. Trenches were cut into the chert at the end of this period, and Robert Kidston and William Henry Lang worked furiously to describe the plant fossils between 1917 and 1921. The arthropods were examined soon afterwards by different workers. Interest in the chert then waned until the field was reinvigorated by Alexander Geoffrey Lyon in the late 1950s, and new material was collected by further trenching from 1963 to 1971. Since 1980, the chert has been examined by the University of M√ºnster, and from 1987 by Aberdeen University, whose researchers confirmed that the chert was indeed produced in a hot spring setting. Cores, allowing an insight into the evolution of the chert over time, were drilled in 1988 and 1997, accompanied by further trenching efforts, which unearthed the Windyfield chert. Until recently, the Rhynie chert was the only such deposit known from the geological record, although recent work has turned up other localities from different time periods and continents. Conditions of formation The chert was formed when silica-rich water from volcanic springs rose rapidly and petrified the early terrestrial ecosystem, in situ and almost instantaneously, in much the same fashion that organisms are petrified by hot springs today \\\\- although the astounding fidelity of preservation has not been found in recent deposits. Hot springs, with temperatures between , were active in a number of episodes; the water had probably cooled to under before it reached the fossilised organisms. Their activity is preserved in 53 beds, thick on average, over a sequence, interbedded with sands, shales and tuffs - which speak of local volcanic activity. Deposition was very rapid. The fluids originated from a shallowly dipping extensional fault system to the west, which bounded an extensional half-graben. Fossils were formed as silica formed in the hot springs themselves; when silica-rich water flooded the surrounding areas; and when it permeated into the surrounding soil. The texture of the sinter formed resemble those found today in freshwater streams at Yellowstone which are typically alkaline (pH 8.7) and tepid . The springs were periodically active, and flowed into an alluvial plain containing small lakes. By analogy with Yellowstone, the chert itself probably formed in a marshy area towards the latter end of the extent of outwash from the springs. Living vegetation covered around 55% of the land area, with litter covering 30% and the remaining 15% of the ground being bare. A braided :Contains useful reconstructions of both the plant associations, and the regional setting. river flowing to the north periodically deposited the sandy layers found in cores when it flooded its banks. Sedimentary textures which appear to have formed in the hydrothermal vents themselves are preserved with a brecciated texture; \\"geyserite\\", a sediment with a botryoidal form reminiscent of modern vent margins, is also found. Spores collected from within surrounding rocks had been heated to different degrees, implying a complex history of local heating by volcanic processes. PreservationPlants= Surface view of a polished piece of Rhynie chert showing many cross-sections of Rhynia stems (axes). Scale bar is 1 cm. Thin section of a piece of Rhynie chert viewed by transmitted light showing the cross-section of a stem of Rhynia The preservation of plants varies from perfect three-dimensional cellular permineralisation to flattened charcoal films. On occasion, plants may have their vertical axes preserved in growth position, with rhizoids still attached to rhizomes; even the plant litter is preserved. Plants were only found on the land - none lived in the water of lakes or hot springs. Rhynia typically grew on sandy surfaces, and is often preserved there in life position; Horneophyton grew on sinter, the sediment formed by the hot springs. These two colonisers were subsequently joined by other genera. The time between sinter deposition events was too short to allow the populations to develop to climax communities, and correspondingly early colonisers appear most frequently, pseudo-randomly, in logged sequences. Plants demonstrate best the great value of the exceptional preservation of the Rhynie chert. The presence of soft tissue, including parenchyma, is not observed elsewhere in the fossil record until the advent of amber in the Triassic. This allows the study of structures such as the air spaces behind stomata, whereas the conventional record at its best allows no more than the counting of stomata. It has also enabled paleobotanists to firmly deduce that plants such as Aglaophyton were not aquatic, as once believed. Further, as plants are preserved in situ, the study of exactly how and why the branching patterns of the early plants emerged is possible, whereas typical fossils only show that branching was present. The analysis of rhizomes and rhizoids makes it possible to discern which plants had an active water uptake system (e.g. Horneophyton), and which were likely to have colonised waterlogged surfaces (Asteroxylon). In some cases, it is possible to see different mechanisms of repairing wounds, and to deduce that they were caused by fungal or bacterial infection. The preservation of spores attached to sporangia allows spore genera to be matched with their producers - something that is otherwise very difficult to do. The chert also allows the identification of the gametophyte phases of taxa such as Aglaophyton. Analysis of spores shows that the flora was lacking in some elements common elsewhere at this time, likely due to its setting in a mountainous region, rather than in a lowland flood plain like most other fossil deposits. However, the spores, which are distinctive enough to permit their producing organism to be identified - are identical to those found elsewhere in \\"normal\\" environments. There is no clear-cut evidence that the plants of the Rhynie assemblage were specifically adapted to stressed environments, and it is likely that the flora in fact represents those members of the global fauna that happened to be capable of colonising and surviving a hot spring environment by virtue of fortuitous preadaptions.

Scale bar is 1 cm. Seven land plant taxa have been identified in the Rhynie and Windyfield cherts:University of Aberdeen, The Biota of Early Terrestrial Ecosystems: The Rhynie Chert. * Aglaophyton * Asteroxylon * Horneophyton * Nothia * Rhynia * Trichopherophyton * Ventarura Another group, Nematophytes, remains enigmatic, but may represent aquatic land plants. =Algae= Several putative chlorophytes have been discovered in the Rhynie assemblage (Mackiella and Rhynchertia). A well-preserved charophyte, Palaeonitella, which inhabited the alkaline freshwater pools towards the end of the sinter apron, has been characterized. =Arthropods= As a result of its exquisite preservation, the Rhynie chert boasts the most diverse non-marine fauna of its time, and is important for our understanding of arthropod terrestrialisation. Typical members of the Rhynie chert arthropod fauna include the crustacean Lepidocaris, the euthycarcinoid Heterocrania, the springtail Rhyniella, the harvestman Eophalangium sheari, Acari (mites), and trigonotarbids in the genus Palaeocharinus. The oldest known hexapod (Rhyniella praecursor), which resembles the modern springtails, was found in the Rhynie chert, pushing dates for the origination of hexapods (a group that includes the insects) back to the Silurian period. =Fungi= Fungi known from the Rhynie chert include the chytridiomycetes, ascomycetes, oomycota (Peronosporomycetes) and glomeromycetes; indeed the only fungal groups not yet known from the Rhynie are the Zygomycota (although they may have formed lichens - see later), and the Basidiomycota, the latter of which may not even have evolved by Rhynie time. The Chytridiomycetes, or Chytrids, are a basal group of fungi, closely related to the true fungi. The chytrids display a range of behaviour in the Rhynie chert. Eucarpic and holocarpic forms are known - i.e. some forms grew specialised fruiting bodies while others did not show specialisation in this fashion. Saprotrophy may be present, and parasitism is common; one individual has even been found parasitising a germinating gametophyte. The fungi were aquatic, and grew in both plants and algae; they are also found preserved \\"loose\\" in the chert matrix. Their flagellate spores are preserved. The largest organism present in Rhynie was probably a fungus, the enigmatic Prototaxites, growing as a mound a metre or more taller than anything in the community, whose isotopic composition varied like a saprotroph and whose septate pores resemble those of fungi. =Cyanobacteria= In the rare instances that cyanobacteria are found in the fossil record, their presence is usually the subject of much controversy, for their simple form is difficult to distinguish from inorganic structures such as bubbles. However, bona fide cyanobacteria are preserved in the Rhynie chert. The aquatic organisms are thought to belong to the Oscillatoriales section on the basis of biomarker absence. The fossils are filamentous, around 3 Œºm in diameter, and grew on plants and the sediment itself. They occasionally form structured colonies which go on to create microbial mats. =Lichens= A new genus of lichen, Winfrenatia, has been recovered from the Rhynie chert. The lichen comprises a thallus, made of layered, aseptate hyphae; a number of depressions are formed on its top surface. Each depression contains a net of hyphae holding a sheathed cyanobacterium. The fungus appears to be related to the Zygomycetes, and the photobiont resembles the coccoid Gloeocapsa and Chroococcidiopsis. Interactions The Rhynie chert, by preserving a snapshot of an ecosystem in situ in high fidelity, gives a unique opportunity to observe interactions between species and kingdoms. There is evidence of parasitic behaviour by fungi on algae Palaeonitella, provoking a hypertrophic response. Herbivory is also evident, judging by boring and piercing wounds in various states of repair, and the mouthparts of arthropods. Coprolites - fossilised droppings - give a useful insight of what animals ate, even if the animals cannot be identified. Coprolites found in the Rhynie chert are typically between 0.5 and 3 mm in size, and contain a variety of contents. Analysis of coprolites allows the identification of different feeding modes, including detritovory and herbivory; some coprolites are so densely packed with spores that it is possible that these made up a substantial proportion of some organisms' diets. The trigonotarbid species found in the deposit were predators: it is possible for many of the arthropods to deduce their likely ecological role, however, it is unclear if this community was representative of a typical terrrestrial arthropod community of the time, or rather was specific to the stressed Rhynie environment. Plants responded to fungal colonisation in different ways, depending on the fungus. The rhizoids of Nothia displayed three responses to fungal infestation: the hyphae of some (mutualistic) colonists were encased by plant cell walls; other (parasitic) fungi were met with typical host responses of increased rhizome cell size; while yet other fungi solicited an increase in thickness and pigmentation of cell walls. Once inside a plant cell, fungi produced spores, which are found in decaying plant cells; the cells may have decayed as a defence mechanism to prevent the fungi from spreading. Fungal interactions are known to promote speciation in modern plants, and presumably also affected Devonian diversity by providing a selection pressure. Mycorrhizae are also found in the Rhynie chert.

Zamia furfuracea leaves The genus comprises deciduous shrubs with aerial or subterranean circular stems, often superficially resembling palms. They produce spirally arranged, pinnate leaves which are pubescent, at least when young, having branched and simple, transparent and coloured hairs. The articulated leaflets lack a midrib, and are broad with subparallel dichotomous venation. Lower leaflets are not reduced to spines, though the petioles often have prickles. The emerging leaves of many Zamia species are striking, some emerging with a reddish or bronze cast (Z. roesli is an example). Zamia picta is even more distinctive, being the only truly variegated cycad (having whitish/yellow speckles on the leaves).Nicolalde-Morej√≥n, F., A. P. Vovides & D. W. Stevenson. 2009. Taxonomic revision of Zamia in Mega-Mexico. Brittonia 61(4): 301‚Äì335. Zamia sporophylls are born in vertical rows in cones, and the megasporophyll apices are faceted or flattened, not spinose. The fleshy seeds are subglobular to oblong or ellipsoidal, and are red, orange, yellow or rarely white. The endosperm is haploid, derived from the female gametophyte. The embryo is straight, with two cotyledons that are usually united at the tips and a very long, spirally twisted suspensor. The sperm of the genus are large, as is typical of cycads, and Zamia roezlii is an example; its sperm are approximately 0.4 mm long and can be seen by the unaided eye. All the species of Zamia produce leafy crowns of foliage that make them choice garden specimens and most varieties branch heavily in age to produce handsome clumps. With a few exceptions, most Zamia species are found in warm, humid, tropical rainforest habitats, growing in the forest understory. However, many species are still fairly adaptable, performing quite well in cultivation, especially in subtropical areas. All species need good drainage and protection from the cold. At least one species, Z. pseudoparasitica, grows as an epiphyte in the branches of trees. The name Zamia comes from the Greek azaniae, meaning \\"a pine cone\\".

His writings on Native American history and reservation culture are considered seminal works, but he is best known for his writings and lectures concerning the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. He received the Bronze Star Medal and the L√©gion d'honneur for service during World War II, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009. He was the last surviving war chief of the Crow Nation and the last living Plains Indian war chief. He was a founding member of the Traditional Circle of Indian Elders and Youth. Early life Joseph Medicine Crow (his Crow name meant High Bird) was born in 1913 on the Crow Indian Reservation near Lodge Grass, Montana, to Amy Yellowtail and Leo Medicine Crow. As the Crow kinship system was matrilineal, he was considered born for his mother's people, and gained his social status from that line. Property and hereditary positions were passed through the maternal line. Chief Medicine Crow, Leo's father, was a highly distinguished and honored chief in his own right, who at the age of 22 became a war chief. He set a standard for aspiring warriors and was his son's inspiration. White Man Runs Him. His maternal step- grandfather, White Man Runs Him, was a scout for US General George Armstrong Custer and an eyewitness to the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Joe Medicine Crow's cousin is Pauline Small, the first woman elected to office in the Crow Tribe of Indians. Education When he was young, Medicine Crow heard direct oral testimony about the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876 from his step-grandfather, White Man Runs Him, who had been a scout for General George Armstrong Custer. Beginning in 1929, when he was in eighth grade, Medicine Crow attended Bacone College in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which also had preparatory classes for students of high school age. He studied until he completed an Associate of Arts degree in 1936. He went on to study sociology and psychology for his bachelor's degree from Linfield College in 1938. He earned a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in 1939; he was the first member of the Crow tribe to obtain a master's degree. His thesis, The Effects of European Culture Contact upon the Economic, Social, and Religious Life of the Crow Indians, has become a well-respected work about Crow culture. He began work toward a doctorate, and by 1941 had completed the required coursework. He did not complete his Ph.D., due to the United States' entry into World War II. Medicine Crow taught at Chemawa Indian School for a year in 1941, then took a defense industry job in the shipyards of Bremerton, Washington in 1942. World War II After spending the latter half of 1942 working in the naval ship yards in Bremerton, Washington, Medicine Crow joined the U.S. Army in 1943. He became a scout in the 103rd Infantry Division, and fought in World War II. Whenever he went into battle, he wore his war paint (two red stripes on his arms) beneath his uniform and a sacred yellow painted eagle feather, provided by a \\"sundance\\" medicine man, beneath his helmet. Medicine Crow completed all four tasks required to become a war chief: touching an enemy without killing him (counting coup), taking an enemy's weapon, leading a successful war party, and stealing an enemy's horse. He touched a living enemy soldier and disarmed him after turning a corner and finding himself face to face with a young German soldier: He also led a successful war party and stole fifty horses owned by the Nazi SS from a German camp, singing a traditional Crow honor song as he rode off. Medicine Crow is the last member of the Crow tribe to become a war chief. He was interviewed and appeared in the 2007 Ken Burns PBS series The War, describing his World War II service. Filmmaker Ken Burns said, \\"The story of Joseph Medicine Crow is something I've wanted to tell for 20 years.\\" Tribal spokesman After serving in the Army, Medicine Crow returned to the Crow Agency. In 1948, he was appointed tribal historian and anthropologist. He worked for the BIA beginning in 1951. He served as a board member or officer on the Crow Central Education Commission almost continuously since its inception in 1972. In 1999, he addressed the United Nations. Medicine Crow was a frequent guest speaker at Little Big Horn College and the Little Big Horn Battlefield Museum. He also was featured in several documentaries about the battle, because of his family's associated oral history. He wrote a script \\"that has been used at the reenactment of the Battle of Little Big Horn held every summer in Hardin since 1965.\\" Medicine Crow was a founding member of Little Bighorn College and of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, Wyoming beginning in 1976. As historian, Medicine Crow was the \\"keeper of memories\\" of his tribe. He preserved the stories and photographs of his people in an archive in his house and garage. His books include Crow Migration Story, Medicine Crow, the Handbook of the Crow Indians Law and Treaties, Crow Indian Buffalo Jump Techniques, and From the Heart of Crow Country. He also wrote a book for children entitled Brave Wolf and the Thunderbird. Death Medicine Crow continued to write and lecture at universities and public institutions until his death, at the age of 102, on April 3, 2016. He was in hospice care in Billings, Montana. He is survived by his only son Ron Medicine Crow, daughters Vernelle Medicine Crow and Diane Reynolds, and stepdaughter Garnet Watan. Honors *Medicine Crow received honorary doctorates from Rocky Mountain College in 1999, his alma mater the University of Southern California in 2003, and Bacone College in 2010. He was an ambassador and commencement speaker at the latter, a college established for Native Americans, for more than 50 years. *His memoir, Counting Coup: Becoming a Crow Chief on the Reservation and Beyond, was chosen in 2007 by the National Council for the Social Studies as a \\"Notable Tradebook for Young People.\\" *On June 25, 2008, Medicine Crow received two military decorations: the Bronze Star for his service in the U.S. Army, and the French Legion of Honor Chevalier medal, both for service during World War II. His other military awards include the Combat Infantryman Badge, Army Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal. *On July 17, 2008, Senators Max Baucus, Jon Tester, and Mike Enzi introduced a bill to award him the Congressional Gold Medal; however, the bill did not garner the required sponsorship of two-thirds of the senate to move forward. *Medicine Crow received the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the highest civilian honor awarded in the United States) from President Barack Obama on August 12, 2009.

Timothy Raison, its founding editor (1962‚Äì68), was later a Conservative MP from 1970 until 1992. In Raison's opinion, New Society sought \\"to mirror, to analyse, to understand, not to exhort or moralise.\\"Timothy Raison Youth in New Society, Rupert Hart-Davis, 1966 It tried to see the world as it was, not as it was supposed to be.

Gina Birch is an English musician and filmmaker, best known as a founding member of post-punk rock band, The Raincoats. Born in Nottingham, Birch attended Nottingham High School for Girls, and later the Hornsey School of Art, where she formed The Raincoats with Ana da Silva in 1977. Following the first breakup of The Raincoats in 1984, Birch worked with experimental musician Mayo Thompson and his ensemble, Red Crayola, for a period in Germany. After this time, Birch formed the band Dorothy, with musician Vicky Aspinall. Both musicians were subsequently signed by Geoff Travis to Chrysalis Records. Following Dorothy's breakup, Birch matriculated at the Royal College of Art, where she studied film direction, and produced several dramas. In the early 1990s, The Raincoats were asked to perform on tour with grunge band Nirvana, and were consequently invited to make an album by DGC Records. This temporarily interrupted Birch's filmmaking endeavors. However, Birch did produce several music videos in this period, including the DVD video for The Libertines, released with their album. Gina has directed videos for Daisy Chainsaw, (2) The Libertines (3), Palma Violets, The Raincoats, Dorothy, and many others. She directed New Order's Crystal with artist Simon Tyszko, as well as multiple video installations. Birch's musical career continued through the 1990s, with the 1998 release of album \\"Slow Dirty Tears\\", with The Hangovers, a band she had formed in 1996. In 2000 and 2007 Birch performed live at Ladyfest, and continues to perform regularly in London.

He has been called the \\"Father of Machine Perception.\\" Biography Selfridge, born in England, was a grandson of Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of Selfridges department stores. His father was Harry Gordon Selfridge Jr. and his mother was a clerk at Selfridge's store. His parents had met, fallen in love, married and had children all in secret, and Oliver never met his grandfather, Harry Sr. He was educated at Malvern College, and, upon moving to the U.S.A., at Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, before earning an S.B. from MIT in mathematics in 1945. He then became a graduate student of Norbert Wiener's at MIT, but did not write up his doctoral research and never earned a Ph.D. Marvin Minsky considered Selfridge to be one of his mentors , and, Selfridge was one of the 11 attendees, with Marvin Minsky, of the Dartmouth workshop that is considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field. Selfridge wrote important early papers on neural networks and pattern recognition and machine learning, and his \\"Pandemonium\\" paper (1959) is generally recognized as a classic in artificial intelligence. In it, Selfridge introduced the notion of \\"demons\\" that record events as they occur, recognize patterns in those events, and may trigger subsequent events according to patterns they recognize. Over time, this idea gave rise to aspect-oriented programming. In 1968, in their formative paper \\"The Computer as a Communication Device\\", J. C. R. Licklider and Robert Taylor introduced a concept known as an OLIVER (Online Interactive Expediter and Responder), which was named in honor of Selfridge. Selfridge spent his career at Lincoln Laboratory, MIT (where he was Associate Director of Project MAC), Bolt, Beranek and Newman, and GTE Laboratories where he became Chief Scientist. He served on the NSA Advisory Board for 20 years, chairing the Data Processing Panel. Selfridge retired in 1993. In 2015, Duncan Campbell identified Selfridge as his \\"best source\\" for Campbell's 1980 reporting on US National Security Agency wiretapping activity at Menwith Hill, UK. Campbell described this operation in New Statesman as a \\"billion dollar phone tap\\". Selfridge also authored four children's books: Sticks, Fingers Come In Fives, All About Mud, and Trouble With Dragons. Selfridge was married and divorced twice and is survived by two daughters and two sons. All four of his children obtained doctorates. See also *Pandemonium architecture NotesFurther reading *O. G.

In 2004 Alfa Romeo revived the 8C name for a V8-engined concept car which made it into production for 2007, the 8C Competizione. The 8C designates 8 cylinders, and originally a straight 8-cylinder engine. The Vittorio Jano designed 8C was Alfa Romeo's primary racing engine from its introduction in 1931 to its retirement in 1939. In addition to the two-seater sports cars it was used in the world's first genuine single-seat Grand Prix racing car, the Monoposto 'Tipo B' - P3 from 1932 onwards. In its later development it powered such vehicles as the twin-engined 1935 6.3-litre Bimotore, the 1935 3.8-litre Monoposto 8C 35 Type C, and the Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Mille Miglia Roadster. It also powered top-of-the-range coach-built production models, including a Touring Spider and Touring Berlinetta. History In 1924, Vittorio Jano created his first straight-eight-cylinder engine for Alfa Romeo, the 1987 cc P2, with common crankcase and four plated- steel two-cylinder blocks, which won the first World Championship ever in 1925. Although it was a straight-8, the 8C designation was not used. Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Spider Corsa 1932 Touring Spider 1937 in 2005 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. The 8C engine, first entered at the 1931 Mille Miglia road race through Italy,Moore 2000 had a common crankcase, now with two alloy four-cylinder blocks, which also incorporated the heads. The bore and stroke (and hence rods, pistons and the like), were the same as the 6C 1750 (bore: 65 mm, stroke: 88 mm 2,336 cc). There was no separate head, and no head gasket to fail, but this made valve maintenance more difficult. A central gear tower drove the overhead camshafts, superchargers and ancillaries. As far as production cars are concerned, the 8C engine powered two models, the 8C 2300 (1931‚Äì1935) and the even more rare and expensive 8C 2900 (1936‚Äì1941), bore increased to 68 mm and stroke to 100 mm (2,905 cc). At the same time, since racing cars were no longer required to carry a mechanic, Alfa Romeo built the first single seater race car. As a first attempt, the 1931 Monoposto Tipo A used a pair of 6-cylinder engines fitted side by side in the chassis. As the resulting car was too heavy and complex, Jano designed a more suitable and successful racer called Monoposto Tipo B (aka P3) for the 1932 Grand Prix season. The Tipo B proved itself the winning car of its era, winning straight from its first outing at the 1932 Italian Grand Prix, and was powered with an enlarged version of the 8C engine now at 2,665 cc, fed through a pair of superchargers instead of a single one. 1933 ex-Scuderia Ferrari Alfa Romeo 8C 2600 Monza Watkins Glen in 1948, Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance \\"Best of Show\\" 2008 and Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este \\"Best of Show\\" 2009. Initially, Alfa Romeo announced that the 8C was not to be sold to private owners, but by autumn 1931 Alfa sold it as a rolling chassis in Lungo (long) or Corto (short) form with prices starting at over ¬£1000. The chassis were fitted with bodies from a selection of Italian coach-builders (Carrozzeria) such as Zagato, Carrozzeria Touring, Carrozzeria Castagna, Carrozzeria Pinin Farina ( later Pininfarina ) and Brianza, even though Alfa Romeo did make bodies. Some chassis were clothed by coach-builders such as Graber, Worblaufen and Tuscher of Switzerland and Figoni of France. Alfa Romeo also had a practice of rebodying cars for clients, and some racing vehicles were sold rebodied as road vehicles. Some of the famous first owners include Baroness Maud Thyssen of the Thyssen family, the owner of the aircraft and now scooter company Piaggio Andrea Piaggio, Raymond Sommer, and Tazio Nuvolari. Models1931 8C 2300= The first model was the 1931 '8C 2300', a reference to the car's 2.3 L (2336 cc) engine, initially designed as a racing car, but actually produced in 188 units also for road use. While the racing version of the 8C 2300 Spider, driven by Tazio Nuvolari won the 1931 and 1932 Targa Florio race in Sicily, the 1931 Italian Grand Prix victory at Monza gave the \\"Monza\\" name to the twin seater GP car, a shortened version of the Spider. The Alfa Romeo factory often added the name of events won to the name of a car. =1931 8C 2300 Le Mans type= 2300 engine with Roots supercharger. '8C 2300 tipo Le Mans' was the sport version of the '8C 2300' and it had a successful debut in the 1931 Eireann Cup driven by Henry Birkin. It won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1931 (Howe-Birkin); 1932 (Chinetti-Sommer); 1933 (Nuvolari-Sommer) and 1934 (Chinetti-Etancelin). The 8C 2300 Le Mans model on display at the Museo Alfa Romeo was bought by Sir Henry Birkin in 1931 for competition use, but it is not the car in which Birkin and Howe won the 1931 Le Mans 24 hours. A 1933 8C 2300 Le Mans, chassis #2311201, is part of the permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, US. The car was owned by Lord Howe who campaigned it in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1934 (DNF) as well as in 1935 when it set the fastest lap before retiring. =1933 8C 2600= In 1933 the supercharged dual overhead cam straight-8 engine, enlarged (bore: 68 mm, stroke: 88 mm, 2557 cc) to 2.6 litres ('8C 2600') for the Tipo B, was fitted to the Scuderia Ferrari 8C Monzas. Scuderia Ferrari had become the \\"semi-official\\" racing department of Alfa Romeo, who were no longer entering races as a factory effort due to the poor economic situation of the company. With the initial 215 hp of the 2.6 engine, the Monoposto Tipo B (P3) racer could accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in less than 7 seconds and could eventually reach 135 mph (217 km/h). For 1934 the race engines became 2.9 litres. Tazio Nuvolari won the 1935 German GP at the N√ºrburgring at the wheel of a 3.2 L Tipo B against the more powerful Silver Arrows from Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union.Motor Sport Magazine Archive: 1935 German Grand Prix  Motor Sport Magazine Archive, accessdate: 27. October 2018 =1935 Monoposto 8C 35 Type C= Eight 3.8-litre versions, sharing no castings with the earlier blocks, were individually built for racing in five months, most being used in the Alfa Romeo Monoposto 8C 35 Type C, as raced by Scuderia Ferrari. (The P3 designation was dropped.) The 3.8 produced at 5500 rpm, and had from 900 rpm to 5500 rpm. It had 15.5-inch drum brakes all round, using Pirelli 5.25 or 5.50 x 19 tyres at the front and 7.00 or 7.50 x 19 tyres at the rear. Though not a match for the big Mercedes and Auto Union on the faster circuits, they came into their own on the tighter circuits and races. In 1936 Tipo Cs fitted with the troublesome V12 did not live up to expectations, and the 3.8 continued to be used. From 1933 Scuderia Ferrari had managed the racing, and the Ferrari prancing horse appeared on the flanks of the Bimotore, but Alfa Corse began to become more active, and Vittorio Jano went at the end of the 1937 season. In 1938 four Alfa Romeo Tipo 308 racers were built for the three- litre class using 8C engines. On September 14, 2013, a former Scuderia Ferrari 8C 35, in which Tazio Nuvolari had won the 1936 Coppa Ciano, was sold for ¬£5.9 million; a new world record price for any Alfa Romeo. It was sold by the Bonhams auction house in its Goodwood Revival Meeting Sale in England. The car in question was the ex-Hans Ruesch, ex-Dennis Poore car, which had been one of the early stars of racing at the Goodwood Motor Circuit 1948‚Äì55. =1935 Bimotore= 1935 Alfa Romeo Bimotore Scuderia Ferrari In 1935, to compete with Mercedes Benz and Auto Union, Enzo Ferrari (Race team manager) and Luigi Bazzi (Designer) built a racer with two 3.2 (3.165-litre) engines, one in the front and one in the rear, giving 6.3 litres and . The drivetrain layout was unusual. The two engines were connected by separate driveshaft to a gearbox with two input shafts, and two angled output shafts, so each of the rear wheels had its own driveshaft. It could never quite succeed against the Mercedes W25 B of Rudolf Caracciola, and was hard on fuel and tyres. The gain in speed was offset by increased pit times. On May 12, 1935, two were entered in the Tripoli Grand Prix driven by Nuvolari and Chiron who finished fourth and fifth. Chiron managed a second at the following 1935 Avus race. On June 16, 1935 Nuvolari drove a specially prepared Bimotore from Florence to Livorno and set a new speed record with an average speed of over . After that it was sidelined in favour of the Tipo C. It was the first racer to use the Dubonnet independent trailing arm front suspension. The V12 was under development, but was not race ready. It was noticed that the Bimotore had a traction advantage on rough ground, so a version of the Bimotore chassis with the independent Dubonnet front end, and a new independent rear with swing axles with radius rods and a transverse leaf spring was used for the Tipo C 3.8s. =8C 2900= The 8C 2900 was designed to compete in sports car races in general and the Mille Miglia in particular. It used the 2.9 L version of the 8C engine and was based on the 8C 35 Grand Prix racing chassis. As such, it had an inline 8-cylinder 2.9-litre engine using two Roots type superchargers fed by two updraught Weber carburettors and fully independent suspension with Dubonnet- type trailing arm suspension with coil springs and hydraulic dampers at front and swing axles with a transverse leaf spring at the rear. 1936 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900A roadster. The 8C 2900A was shown to the public at the 1935 London Motor Show and was advertised for sale there. The engine, with a compression ratio of 6.5:1 and a stated power output of at 5300 rpm, was detuned from the Grand Prix racing version. Ten 2900As were built, five in 1935 and five in 1936. Scuderia Ferrari entered three 8C 2900As in the 1936 Mille Miglia and again in the 1937 Mille Miglia. In 1936 they finished in the top three positions, with Marquis Antonio Brivio winning, Giuseppe Farina finishing second, and Carlo Pintacuda finishing third. In 1937 they finished in the top two positions, with Pintacuda winning and Farina finishing second; the third 2900A, driven by Clemente Biondetti, did not finish. The 8C 2900A also won the 1936 Spa 24 Hours with Raymond Sommer and Francesco Severi. The 8C 2900B began production in 1937. The 2900B design made some concessions to comfort and reliability. The engine was detuned further, having a compression ratio of 5.75:1 and a stated power output of at 5200 rpm. The 2900B chassis was available in two wheelbases: the Corto (short) at , which was longer than the 2900A's wheelbase, and the Lungo (long) at . The wheels of the 2900B had 19-inch rims fitted with hydraulic drum brakes. Thirty-two 2900Bs were built in regular production, ten in 1937, and twenty-two in 1938. Another 2900B was assembled from parts in 1941. Most of these cars were bodied by Carrozzeria Touring, although a few were bodied by Pininfarina An 8C 2900 with Pininfarina cabriolet bodywork was auctioned for US$4,072,000 by Christie's at Pebble Beach, California. This was the tenth highest price ever paid for a car at auction at the time. 1938 8C 2900B Mille Miglia Roadster The Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B MM that won the 1938 Mille Miglia driven by Clemente Biondetti. Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum, Philadelphia, PA, USA In 1938, Alfa Corse, an in-house racing team for Alfa Romeo, took over the activities of Scuderia Ferrari, along with many of their personnel, including Enzo Ferrari. Alfa Corse prepared four 8C 2900B Corto cars for the 1938 Mille Miglia. These used Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera roadster bodies. Three of these cars had their engines tuned to give , while the fourth, assigned to Biondetti, had an engine from an Alfa Romeo Tipo 308 Grand Prix car, which delivered The cars finished in the top two positions, with Biondetti winning and Pintacuda finishing second after leading the race from Piacenza to Terni where his brakes locked up. The other two 8C 2900B Mille Miglia roadsters did not finish; Farina crashed and Eugenio Siena had a blown engine. Piero Dusio finished third in a privately entered 8C 2900A. One of the 2800B Mille Miglia roadsters later won the 1938 Spa 24 Hours with Pintacuda and Severi driving. Phil Hill competed in several west coast United States races in Pintacuda's car in 1951 before driving for Ferrari. 1938 8C 2900B Le Mans Speciale Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B Le Mans Alfa Corse also prepared and entered a single 8C 2900B, chassis number 412033, for the 1938 Le Mans.

He is best known as the leader of the research group that in 1996 first cloned a mammal from an adult somatic cell, a Finnish Dorset lamb named Dolly. He was appointed OBE in 1999 for services to embryo development and knighted in the 2008 New Year Honours. Early life and education Wilmut was born in Hampton Lucy, Warwickshire, England. Wilmut's father, Leonard Wilmut, was a mathematics teacher who suffered from diabetes for fifty years, which eventually caused him to become blind. He was a student of the former Boys' High School, in Scarborough, where his father taught. Wilmut's early desire was to embark on a naval career, but he was unable to do so due to his colour blindness. As a school boy, Wilmut worked as a farm hand on weekends, which inspired him to study Agriculture at the University of Nottingham. In 1966, Wilmut spent 8 weeks working in the laboratory of Christopher Polge, who is credited with developing the technique of cryopreservation in 1949. The following year Wilmut joined Polge's laboratory to undertake a Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Cambridge from which he graduated in 1971 with a thesis on the semen cryopreservation. During this time he was a postgraduate student at Darwin College, Cambridge. Career and research Since his PhD, he has been involved in research focusing on gametes and embryogenesis, including working at the Roslin Institute. Wilmut was the leader of the research group that in 1996 first cloned a mammal, a lamb named Dolly. Dolly died of a respiratory disease in 2003. However, in 2008 Wilmut announced that he would abandon the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer by which Dolly was created in favour of an alternative technique developed by Shinya Yamanaka. This method has been used in mice to derive pluripotent stem cells from differentiated adult skin cells, thus circumventing the need to generate embryonic stem cells. Wilmut believes that this method holds greater potential for the treatment of degenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and to treat stroke and heart attack patients. Wilmut led the team that created Dolly, but in 2006 admitted his colleague Keith Campbell deserved \\"66 per cent\\" of the invention that made Dolly's birth possible, and that the statement \\"I did not create Dolly\\" was accurate. His supervisory role is consistent with the post of principal investigator held by Wilmut at the time of Dolly's creation. Wilmut is an Emeritus Professor at the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and in 2008 was knighted in the New Year Honours for services to science. In 2006 his book After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning was published,After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning co-authored with Roger Highfield. Awards and honours In 1998 he received the Lord Lloyd of Kilgerran Award and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Wilmut was appointed Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999 and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2002. He is also an elected Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 1999 and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was elected an EMBO Member in 2003. In 1997 Wilmut was Time magazine man of the year runner up. He was knighted in the 2008 New Year Honours.

It was developed by Tom Oberheim, and was the first production synthesizer capable of playing chords. Specification Oberheim took the idea and electronics of a Minimoog synthesizer and put them in a small box, making a few changes, and produced the SEM (synthesizer expansion module), which became the building block of his polyphonic synths. By strapping two, four, or eight of these SEMs together under keyboard control, he was able to create practical, albeit large, synthesizers that could play two, four, or eight notes simultaneously. Oberheim polyphonic was born. Each SEM in an Oberheim polyphonic generates one voice (or note). The four- and 8-voice models included a \\"preset programmer\\" which allowed the user to store and recall most sound settings, and you could glide from one note or chord to another using portamento. The Oberheim polyphonic was later outdated by a new line of microprocessor-controlled Oberheim synthesizers, beginning with the OB-X. The OB-X was fully programmable and significantly more compact than the Oberheim polyphonic. Despite their maintenance cost and rarity, Oberheim polyphonic synthesizers are still adored by many musicians today for their characteristic sonic 'thickness' and 'depth' caused in part by the random variance between each SEM module.

Other solitaire games in this family include Spaces, Addiction, Vacancies, Clown Solitaire, Paganini, Montana itself, Red Moon, and Blue Moon. Sometimes these alternate names are used to refer to the same game. Rules The cards are dealt into four rows of thirteen. The aces are removed and discarded from further play. The gaps that they leave behind are filled by cards that are the same suit and a rank higher than the card on the left of the gap. (For example, 4‚ô£ can be placed beside 3‚ô£.) However, any gap at the right of a King is considered dead and no card can fill it. Any gap on the left hand side of the row should be placed by a deuce and the row should be built up by suit beside the deuce (i. e. 2-3-4-5, etc.). It is the discretion of the player on which suit would occupy which row. When there are no more possible moves, the round is over. The cards that are not in order are gathered, making sure to leave any suit sequence (e.g., ‚ô•2-3-4-5) behind. In some variations, the cards are then shuffled;\\"Gaps\\" (p.208) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. \\"Gaps\\" (p.38) in The Little Book of Solitaire, Running Press, 2002. in others, they are not. The cards are then redealt, making sure there is a gap in each row at the immediate right of each suit sequence or at the extreme left of the row if no suit sequence is formed in that row. There are only three rounds in the usual rules. But some variants allow four, and some have no limit. The game is won when all 48 cards are arranged in numerical order and in suits, with the gaps of each row beside the Kings at the extreme right hand of the row. The probability of winning depends on which rules are followed. In variations where the cards are shuffled after each round and the rounds are limited to three, an experienced player will win perhaps one game in 20. In variations where the cards are not shuffled, but the limit of three rounds remains, one win in seven games may be expected. If the number of rounds is not limited, winning is just a matter of time when cards are shuffled; if they are not, winning is very likely although some rare positions cannot be won. Variants Variants of Gaps include Addiction Solitare, which is played exactly as Gaps except that there are three reshuffles rather than the standard two, and the aces can be used in each reshuffle and redeal to create any gaps. Double Montana is a variant played with two decks, and is also called Big Paganini, or just Paganini.\\"Paganini\\" (p.237) in The Complete Book of Card Games by Peter Arnold, Hamlyn Publishing, 2010. The cards are dealt in eight rows of 13 cards each. Aces are removed and placed at the left of each row. In some sub-variants, two redeals are allowed, in others, there are no redeals.

Gameplay  The title screen of Summer Carnival '92: Recca. The game was known for having high sprite counts while maintaining fast speeds. Recca is described by shoot 'em up fans and reviewers as one of the toughest games in history. By using a rom hack or cheat code, the Sega logo appears and explodes, then the Nintendo logo appears. (\\"Sega\\" and \\"Nintendo\\" are spelled with \\"?\\"s instead of \\"e\\"s.)  Development  The game was developed by programmer Shinobu Yagawa, who would later work on games like Battle Garegga, Pink Sweets, and Ibara. The music for the game was composed by Nobuyuki Shioda. As its name indicates, Recca was created for a shooting game competition called the \\"Summer Carnival\\" by Naxat Soft, which took place on July 17, 1992. Although it is a little-known game, Recca is one of the few games that pushes the hardware of the Famicom console to its limits. For example, the game shows sprites for effects (like explosions) at 30fps instead of 60fps to work around the sprite limitations of the system. Another game to use this technique is Contra.  Release  The game was released on July 17, 1992 in Japan. As only a few copies were sold, the game is now quite rare, with cartridges selling for around . One reason for its general obscurity is due to the fact that upon its release in 1992, focus was already on the Famicom's successor, the Super Famicom console. In 2014, the Famicom cartridge was listed as costing ¬£350‚Äî¬£400 in the United Kingdom. It was released for the Nintendo eShop on December 12, 2012, costing only . It also was released for the first time in North America and Europe on the Nintendo eShop on September 5, 2013 and August 15, 2013 respectively. The soundtrack was released by Scitron on September 21, 2005 as Legend Consumer Series - Summer Carnival '92 Recca Original Soundtrack.  Reception  On release, Weekly Famitsu gave the game a score of 19 out of 40. Famitsu writers commented that it is unsuitable for beginners, and that there too many enemies on screen to keep track. In 1994, Polish magazine Top Secret gave the game a score of 5/5. Nintendo Life rated the 3DS Virtual Console release an 8/10 and commented that \\"it's hard to recommend Recca to anybody but the most die-hard fans of the genre. Despite this, however, it is easily one of best and most impressive shoot 'em up games made for the system, and anybody who isn't afraid of a challenge (or using save states a lot) will find this a more than worthy pickup.\\"  References  External links   Nobuyuki Shioda ~ Â°©Áî∞‰ø°‰πã Ôºà„Åó„Åä„Å† „ÅÆ„Å∂„ÇÜ„ÅçÔºâ at GameMusicComposerMEMO Category:1992 video games Category:Kaga Create games Category:KID games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Recca"},{"id":"1631772","text":"In mathematics, topological graph theory is a branch of graph theory. It studies the embedding of graphs in surfaces, spatial embeddings of graphs, and graphs as topological spaces.J.L. Gross and T.W. Tucker, Topological graph theory, Wiley Interscience, 1987 It also studies immersions of graphs. Embedding a graph in a surface means that we want to draw the graph on a surface, a sphere for example, without two edges intersecting. A basic embedding problem often presented as a mathematical puzzle is the three- cottage problem. Other applications can be found in printing electronic circuits where the aim is to print (embed) a circuit (the graph) on a circuit board (the surface) without two connections crossing each other and resulting in a short circuit.  Graphs as topological spaces  To an undirected graph we may associate an abstract simplicial complex C with a single-element set per vertex and a two-element set per edge.Graph Topology, from PlanetMath. The geometric realization C of the complex consists of a copy of the unit interval [0,1] per edge, with the endpoints of these intervals glued together at vertices. In this view, embeddings of graphs into a surface or as subdivisions of other graphs are both instances of topological embedding, homeomorphism of graphs is just the specialization of topological homeomorphism, the notion of a connected graph coincides with topological connectedness, and a connected graph is a tree if and only if its fundamental group is trivial. Other simplicial complexes associated with graphs include the Whitney complex or clique complex, with a set per clique of the graph, and the matching complex, with a set per matching of the graph (equivalently, the clique complex of the complement of the line graph). The matching complex of a complete bipartite graph is called a chessboard complex, as it can be also described as the complex of sets of nonattacking rooks on a chessboard.  Example studies  John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan derived a means of testing the planarity of a graph in time linear to the number of edges. Their algorithm does this by constructing a graph embedding which they term a \\"palm tree\\". Efficient planarity testing is fundamental to graph drawing. Fan Chung et al. studied the problem of embedding a graph into a book with the graph's vertices in a line along the spine of the book. Its edges are drawn on separate pages in such a way that edges residing on the same page do not cross. This problem abstracts layout problems arising in the routing of multilayer printed circuit boards. Graph embeddings are also used to prove structural results about graphs, via graph minor theory and the graph structure theorem.

Early life Also known as White Buffalo That Turns Around, he was born into the Big Lodge Clan of the Crow Nation, the son of Bull Chief and Offers Her Red Cloth. At the age of about 18, he volunteered to serve as a scout with the United States Army on April 10, 1876, in its campaign against the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne, traditional enemies of the Crow. Service as a scout White Man Runs Him \\"enlisted on April 10, 1876 at the Crow Agency, Montana Territory, for six months in the 7th United States Infantry.\\" On June 21, 1876, he was transferred to Custer's Seventh U.S. Cavalry as part of a contingent of six Crow warrior/scouts, including Goes Ahead, Curly, Hairy Moccasin, White Swan, and Half Yellow Face, the leader of the scouts. He scouted for Lt. Charles Varnum's column in the days preceding the battle. In the early morning hours of June 25, 1876, he and other Crow scouts accompanied Varnum and Custer to the Crow's Nest, a high point on the Little Bighorn/Rosebud Creek divide, from which the Little Bighorn valley could be viewed at a distance of about seventeen air miles. The scouts could see indications of a large horse herd and the smoke of many morning fires, though the encampment itself was hidden from view on the valley floor. The Crow scouts advised Custer that the encampment was very large. Custer prepared to attack, however. Custer was concerned that during the morning of June 25, Sioux/Cheyenne warriors had detected the presence of his 650-man force, and if he did not promptly attack, the villagers would scatter, thus denying the army the confrontation it sought with the Sioux/Cheyenne forces. According to White Man Runs Him's own accounts, after sending Major Marcus Reno's column to attack the settlement first, Custer headed down Medicine Trail Creek to engage the Sioux and Cheyenne. White Man Runs Him recounts that he and the other Crow scouts intended to follow Custer down into battle, but that their chief scout, Mitch Boyer, ordered them to rejoin the pack train instead.https://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_man_runs_him_little_big_horn.html Another, more colorful version of the story relates that the Crow scouts were convinced they were about to die in battle against such a large force of Sioux, so they took off their uniforms and donned Crow war clothing. When Custer demanded to know why, they responded that they wished to die as warriors rather than soldiers. Custer was angered by what he perceived as fatalism and relieved them from further service about an hour before engaging in the final battle. White Man Runs Him retired to a ridge along with Goes Ahead, Hairy Moccasin, and Strikes That Bear (an Arikara scout) to join Major Reno. They were engaged briefly in battle, but survived the engagement. He then joined Colonel John Gibbon's column.  Later life  Crow Scouts visit Custer Battlefield about 1913. Left to right: White-Man-Runs-Him, Hairy Moccasin, Curley, Goes Ahead After the battle, he lived on the Crow reservation near Lodge Grass, Montana. He was the stepgrandfather of Joe Medicine Crow, a Crow tribal historian who used his grandfather's stories as a basis for his later histories of the battle, and grandfather to Pauline Small, the first woman elected to office in the Crow Tribe of Indians. His status as a Little Big Horn survivor made him a minor celebrity late in life, and he even made a cameo appearance in the 1927 Hollywood movie Red Raiders.

She is a professional criminal and burglar that regularly uses her attractiveness to fool her targets. Unlike the rest of the Lupin III cast, Fujiko's physical appearance changes for most installments in the franchise. Her name is derived from the word . Monkey Punch saw a picture of Mt. Fuji on a calendar and in less than a minute decided on a name, omitting the \\"rei\\" part from \\"reih≈ç\\" and adding a \\"ko\\" to \\"fuji\\" to make it look more pleasing when spelled. She is the star of the fourth Lupin III anime television series, 2012's The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, making it the first to not star Ars√®ne Lupin III as the protagonist.  Creation  As the Lupin III series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults, Fujiko Mine was created to add a female presence. Her name was inspired by a picture of Mount Fuji, Monkey Punch added the -ko female suffix to create her first name, and chose \\"Mine\\" for her family name because of its meaning as \\"summit\\". She was developed from the intention to fulfill a \\"Bond girl\\" role. Creating a new female character each week was too difficult for Monkey Punch, so she evolved into a single character. At the beginning of the series, many of the women Lupin encounters are named Fujiko, but are treated as different characters from chapter to chapter. This concept was later changed to make Fujiko a single character who changes style frequently. Monkey Punch compared the characters of Lupin and Fujiko to those of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and described them as \\"Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other\\".  Personality  While Fujiko is not part of Lupin's gang, she often participates in their exploits either as a partner or a competitor. Her main tactic is to stick with Lupin and company until the plunder is made available, then double-cross her colleagues. Frequently, she finds it necessary to betray Lupin to get close to the enemy, then after ingratiating herself into his trust will acquire the swag and escape (rarely, she will help to extricate Lupin, Goemon and Jigen from capture or any deadly trouble she put them into, as if to atone). Fujiko is also known to provide Zenigata or other law enforcement officers with information and assistance in order to gain her own freedom. At one point, Fujiko was made Zenigata's replacement on the ICPO's Lupin operation, however this was a cover for her to get into a secret vault. Of this two-faced nature Lupin is surprisingly forgiving. In the 1999 television movie Da Capo of Love: Fujiko‚Äôs Unlucky Days, Lupin carefully treats the amnesiatic Fujiko, hoping she gets better as he \\"looks forward to her betrayals\\". Fujiko is an excellent markswoman, her favorite weapon being a Browning M1910, typically holstered in her garter. Later, she's revealed superb martial arts skills, capable of rendering an attacker twice her weight unconscious with a single blow. She is very good at disguises as well as accents and apparently can speak dozens of foreign languages in addition to her native Japanese. Like the other members of Lupin's team, she is able to pilot virtually any land, sea, and air vehicle, with her personal preference being a conventional Kawasaki motorcycle. She can be very promiscuous when necessary to complete a job, and has kissed and even had sex with different men for information or to escape a dangerous situation. The 2012 anime series implies heavily that Fujiko is bisexual. Daisuke Jigen despises Fujiko and sees her showing up as a sign of rough times ahead, although despite this, in the original manga he was still one of her suitors. Goemon Ishikawa XIII, who had a brief romance with Ms. Mine, has been known to work on capers with Fujiko independent of the other gang members, but can be equally distrustful of her when he thinks she is manipulating Lupin. Still, in the Lupin the Third Part II anime Jigen and Goemon are seen working together numerous times with Fujiko, trusting their lives on her, and vice versa, with them having a sibling rivalry of sorts. In the anime, Fujiko also displays at times a more frivolous and care-free personality, which sees her pranking Lupin whenever she can. Lupin is completely infatuated with Fujiko, and will do anything for her. While Fujiko is aware of this and always uses it to her advantage, she never gets Lupin into trouble where he cannot escape. Monkey Punch has said that the two \\"enjoy each other\\", and are quite content with their bizarre yet amicable relationship, comparing it to his own marriage. Although she is more willing to contain her feelings, Fujiko does have a love for Lupin. She rarely wishes to fully reveal her affection except if she thinks one or both are dying. On occasions where Lupin appears to have died, she grieves and considers him the most important person to her. However, her not-altogether-hidden feelings submerge again when she finds him alive. Fujiko usually dresses in the height of fashion, with formal gowns and fine jewelry her trademark; when informal, she typically wears outfits that accentuate her robust figure. Fujiko's favorite pastimes appear to be shopping, attending social functions, disco dancing, horseback riding, and dating wealthy gentlemen. She enjoys champagne, fine wine and has been seen more than once consuming a martini; she also smokes cigarettes and occasionally uses a kiseru.  Background  Fujiko as seen in Alcatraz Connection Fujiko made her first appearance in chapter three , thus being the first of Lupin's three associates to arrive. She initially appears as a con woman attempting to worm her way into the fortune of a rich family, whose heir has hired Lupin as security. Immediately upon arriving, she recognizes Lupin through his disguise, and by the end of the arc, Lupin has sided with her to rob the entire family. Due to the episodic nature of the manga, many of Fujiko's appearances treat her and Lupin as meeting for the first time, even after the incident where Lupin kills her father. Many of the stories feature her trying to capture the same object as Lupin, usually being bested by Lupin, only occasionally being the one who gets the prize. It should also be noted that unlike his anime version, Lupin is a ladies-man in the manga, with he and Fujiko having slept together numerous times. This is the opposite in the anime adaptations (excluding the series The Woman Called Fujiko Mine), which often has Fujiko betraying Lupin and for the most part denying his flirting. Fujiko's background includes organized crime in partnership with the notorious killer known as Pun. The couple was famous for carrying out contract killings without failure. However, the partnership ended abruptly when Pun's employer ordered him to kill Fujiko after she made a mistake. Pun could not face being asked to kill Fujiko and she disappeared. Fujiko claims to suffer from amnesia and cannot remember anything prior those events, however she recognises Pun when he arrives looking for her.  Actresses  Miyuki Sawashiro has been Fujiko's voice actress since 2011. Fujiko Mine was first voiced by Eiko Masuyama in both versions of the 1969 pilot film for the first anime. Although Yukiko Nikaido was given the role when the first anime was actually produced (1971‚Äì72), Masuyama would return to voice Fujiko for the second anime (1977‚Äì78) and continue to do so until her retirement in 2010, with one exception. Due to budget concerns, TMS decided not to employ the regular voice cast for the 1987 original video animation The Fuma Conspiracy, with Fujiko voiced by Mami Koyama. The 2011 TV special Blood Seal ‚Äì Eternal Mermaid marked the first appearance of Miyuki Sawashiro as the character and she continues to voice Fujiko Mine to this day. Masuyama did return to the role once more for the 2012 Lupin Family Lineup short original video animation. Due to a lack of localization credits on any known prints, Fujiko's English voice actress in the 1979 Toho dub of The Mystery of Mamo, where the character's name was changed to \\"Margo\\", remains unknown. Other voice actors include Edie Mirman (1992-5, Streamline), Michele Seidman (1995, AnimEigo). Toni Barry (1996, Manga UK), and Dorothy Fahn (2000, Animaze/Manga). Meredith McCoy voiced the character for Funimation Entertainment's dubs of several TV specials and theatrical films between 2002 and 2005. Michelle Ruff voiced Fujiko in the Phuuz dub for Pioneer/Geneon's release of the second anime between 2003 and 2006, before reprising the role for Funimation's 2013 dub of The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, and Discotek Media's dubs of the fifth and sixth anime. Cristina Vee voiced Fujiko in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub for Discotek's 2015 release of the Jigen's Gravestone film, and reprised her role for their 2018 dub of Goemon Ishikawa's Spray of Blood and 2020 dub of Fujiko Mine's Lie. In the realm of live-action, Fujiko is portrayed by Eiko Ezaki in the 1974 film and by Meisa Kuroki in the 2014 film. In the 2015 musical adaptation of Lupin III performed by the Takarazuka Revue, Fujiko was portrayed by Seshiro Daigo.  Reception  Popularity = In 2007, Oricon polled readers on which characters they would most like to see in their own series. Fujiko appeared in the seventh position among female voters, and fifth place overall. The company also asked their readers in the very same year who they believed is the most beautiful woman in manga. Fujiko Mine was crowned the title by scoring first place overall with high rankings from both male and female voters.Anime Insider. Vol. 48, Page 16 She was listed as the second most iconic anime heroine by Mania.com. In 2012, in a Japanese poll on which character's voice actor should never change, Fujiko came in second among males and third amongst females. In 2013, eBookJapan polled its female customers in their 20s and 30s on which manga heroine they felt had the ideal body. In the poll that considered their sexiness, physical fitness and health, Fujiko was the first place answer. A 2015 Charapedia poll, which asked fans to list their favourite \\"cool\\" women in anime, had Fujiko Mine placed seventeenth. In a 2017 survey that polled 12,000 Japanese, Fujiko Mine was voted the Most Splendid Heroine of the Sh≈çwa Era and the third most of the Heisei Era. = Critical reception = Dallas Marshall of THEM Anime Reviews called Fujiko one of the most iconic female characters in anime history and referred to her as \\"the sexy glue that keeps Lupin and his merry band of misfits together.\\" Crunchyroll's Chad Landon Smith wrote that \\"mysterious\\" is Fujiko's defining character trait and that being \\"born of the femme fatale stereotype, her intentions and motivations are never meant to be clear.\\" Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict described Fujiko as \\"The 70's answer to Lara Croft\\". In his review of the first anime, Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post enjoyed that while Fujiko has a bit of a \\"sexpot feel about her here, she's the one that's the most conniving here and does it all with a wicked grin and a smile.\\" Anime News Network's Mike Crandol reviewing the second anime felt that while Fujiko's main function is \\"eye candy in the best Bond tradition,\\" her \\"double-crossing nature keeps Lupin and company on their toes and the plot-twists twice as much fun.\\" Reviewing The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, Jacob Hope Chapman of Anime News Network wrote that Fujiko never has an answer for what she does, \\"but is always overjoyed to continue that life, making her fun to watch, but also an intriguing mystery to be solved.\\" He also stated that \\"surprisingly, Fujiko's constant objectification culminates in one of the most feminist-positive anime to come around in years.\\" Of Meisa Kuroki's performance in the 2014 live-action film, Matt Schley of Otaku USA commented that the actress comes as close to Fujiko \\"as any real human female can, I suppose.\\" = Legacy = A manga called starring Fujiko and Lupin's son ran in Weekly Sh≈çnen Action for 18 chapters starting in 1975. A spinoff manga of Lupin III, titled , follows three young female thieves who work for Fujiko. It was written by Suzuki Izo and published in two volumes on September 28, 2009. Fujiko was a source of inspiration for the characters Yukiko Fujimine and Vermouth in Gosho Aoyama's Detective Conan manga; Fujimine representing the good side of Fujiko and Vermouth the bad. The former's name is a combination of Fujiko Mine and the first name of Fujiko's former voice actress Yukiko Nikaido. In the manga Azumanga Daioh by Kiyohiko Azuma, Tomo Takino is a fan of the Lupin III series and admires Fujiko. She constantly makes references to herself as Fujiko Mine, despite the fact the two are totally different in looks and personality.Azumanga Daioh. Vol. 2, chapter July In the Aria the Scarlet Ammo light novel series, the character Riko Mine Lupin IV is the daughter of Lupin and Fujiko.

History of the nickname Carl Reichert, Katzenfuge (engraving, 1870) The nickname, which was never used by the composer himself but was introduced only early in the 19th century, originates from a story about how Scarlatti came up with the strikingly unusual motif on which the fugue is built. Legend has it that Scarlatti had a pet cat called Pulcinella, who was described by the composer as prone to walking across the keyboard, always curious about its sounds. On one occasion, according to the story, Scarlatti wrote down a phrase from one of these \\"improvisation sessions\\", and used it as a lead motif in a fugue: \\\\header { tagline = ##f } \\\\score { << \\\\relative c { \\\\key g \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\tempo 4. = 80 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"harpsichord\\" %% K30 theme g,4. bes ees fis bes cis d8 c! bes a g fis g } >> \\\\layout { \\\\context { \\\\Score \\\\remove \\"Metronome_mark_engraver\\" } } \\\\midi {} } The nickname was used in concert programmes in the 19th century (see Performances section below), and was also used by publishers including Muzio Clementi, Carl Czerny and Alessandro Longo.Booklet accompanying CD box set Scarlatti: The Keyboard Sonatas performed by Scott Ross; see page 143 Influence The piece was published in London in 1739.

Its ZIP Code is 20841. According to the United States 2010 Census, the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) for Boyds covers an area of about and has a population of 10,460.Zip-codes.com Black Hill Regional Park, Little Seneca Lake, and Seneca Creek State Park are located in Boyds. History The community was named for Colonel James Alexander Boyd (1823‚Äì1896), a Scottish immigrant who was a construction engineer for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Boyd built a temporary village to house construction workers as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built the Metropolitan Branch line after the American Civil War. The railroad line began service in 1873. After the railroad station opened, a mill, stores, and other businesses were established in the area. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad opened a brick railroad station in 1887. The railroad station was demolished to make way for installation of a second track in 1927. A wooden station was built as a replacement, but it was later taken down. Commuter Rail service (primarily to Washington, D.C.) is still provided at Boyds by the MARC system. James Boyd established dairy farms in the area and lived in the town until his death in 1896.Clan Boyd Society, International. \\"Colonel James Alexander Boyd.\\" Accessed December 10, 2008. =Boyds Negro School= Boyds Negro School in 2013 Boyds Negro School, located at 19510 White Ground Road, was the only public school erected for African Americans who lived in the area from 1896 to 1936. Boyds Negro School is a Maryland Historic Site. Boyds Negro School is a small, one-room school house, containing a small number of desks, a blackboard, and an authentic potbelly stove, as well as a framed picture of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Subjects taught in the school included spelling, cooking, reading, singing, and weaving.Coleman, Margaret: Montgomery County: A Pictorial History, 1984 Boyds Negro School was renovated by the Boyds Historical Society in 1989. The Boyds Historical Society filled the building with furnishings so the school would look as it did in the early 1900s. In 2006, termites caused major damage to the wooden floor boards, and the school building was renovated. Boyds Negro School reopened on June 28, 2008, one of Montgomery County's annual heritage days. Boyds Negro School is currently open to the public on the last Sunday of every month, from 2:00 to 4:00 PM, April through October or upon request. =Boyds Mercantile and Stores= The first Boyds Country Store was opened in 1873, the same year that the railroad was connected to the town. It was run by James E. Williams. The store served as a market of goods for both citizens and passers-bye in Boyds, as well as a meeting place for the townspeople in the afternoon. Colonel Boyd built a second store across the road in 1895. It housed the general store and post office on its first floor and a town hall on the second floor along with a dance hall. As time went by, the town hall became smaller and smaller as the building was used for additional purposes until it was finally torn down for salvageable lumber in the early 1940s. In the evenings, families would gather on the front porch of the general store; the parents talking and their children playing out on the lawn in front of the store. After the first country store became vacant in 1946, it was bought in an auction by Brice P. Selby. He was known to allow his customers to buy on credit, resulting in not much cash profit for him and his store. However, Selby was well known as a kind and generous soul. A third store, known as the Boyds Country Market, exists on Barnesville Road across from the site of the old town hall. Boyds Country Market was built by Will Williams in 1933. The first two Boyds Country Stores, as well as the town hall, old Hoyle's Mill, and a hardware store were all destroyed in the development of the surrounding area. A small post office was located at the back of the country store from the early 1930s until 1974, when it was relocated to a new building on Barnesville Road, where it still sits today.Virts, Arthur: Boyds: a Character Study, 2008 =Recent development in and around Boyds= Boyds has until recently been a predominantly rural area. The first phase of modern development occurred in the 1980s, following the creation of the man-made Little Seneca Lake. However, since the 2000 Census, there has been enormous population growth in the zip code, particularly in the areas near Germantown and Clarksburg. Large home developments with thousands of residents each, such as The Vistas near the intersection of Route 118 and Richter Farm Road, have rapidly replaced farmland and forest. Geography More recently, there has been some discussion as to the exact southern boundary of Boyds. Survey maps show that the community's southern boundary runs along Little Seneca Creek. Demographics The residents of Boyds are 38.6% white, 9% Hispanic, 13.8% black, 35.3% Asian, 3.3% mixed or other.

In it, Peter denies having associated with Jesus, who is being sought by authorities. Denial, in ordinary English usage, is asserting that a statement or allegation is not true (which might be accurate or inaccurate). It may also mean the refusal of a request, but this article covers denial of true factual claims. In psychology, denialism is a person's choice to deny reality as a way to avoid a psychologically uncomfortable truth. In psychoanalytic theory (which has been criticized as unscientific and factually unfounded), denial is a defense mechanism in which a person is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming evidence. The concept of denial is important in twelve-step programs where the abandonment or reversal of denial that substance dependence is problematic forms the basis of the first, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth steps. People who are exhibiting symptoms of a serious medical condition sometimes deny or ignore those symptoms because the idea of having a serious health problem is uncomfortable or disturbing. The American Heart Association cites denial as a principal reason that treatment of a heart attack is delayed. Because the symptoms are so varied, and often have other potential explanations, the opportunity exists for the patient to deny the emergency, often with fatal consequences. It is common for patients to delay recommended mammograms or other tests because of a fear of cancer, even on average this worsens the long-term medical outcome.  Psychology  Initial short-term denial can be a good thing, giving you time to adjust to a painful or stressful issue. It might also be a precursor to making some sort of change in your life. But denial can also be harmful; if denial persists and prevents you from taking appropriate action, it's a harmful response.  In political and economic context  Some people who are known as denialists2005, The Cape Times 2005-03-11 or true believers have known to be in denial of historical or scientific facts accepted by the mainstream of society or by experts, for political or economic reasons.

He was previously a Florida state trial court judge, a federal public defender, and an attorney in private practice who won a criminal case before the United States Supreme Court. As a federal judge, Whittemore presided over a number of high-profile cases, including a lawsuit against Major League Baseball to challenge its draft procedure, and the Terri Schiavo case, after the United States Congress had specifically given the Middle District of Florida jurisdiction to hear the seven-year-long fight over whether the brain-damaged Schiavo should be taken off life support. Background and early legal career Whittemore was born in Walterboro, South Carolina. He graduated with honors from the University of Florida in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and then received his Juris Doctor from Stetson University Law School in 1977. He briefly worked at Bauer, Morlan & Wells, a small law firm in St. Petersburg, Florida, before becoming one of the original four federal public defenders in the Middle District of Florida in 1978. Whittemore returned to private practice in Tampa three years later as an associate at Whittemore & Seybold, and then at Whittemore & Campbell from 1982 until 1987. In 1985, Whittemore successfully argued before the United States Supreme Court in Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284 (1986), that a criminal suspect's silence after he received the Miranda warning could not be used at trial to discredit his insanity defense. Whittemore's client had been convicted of sexual battery; the Court's ruling secured him a new trial. From 1987 until 1990, Whittemore was a sole practitioner in Tampa. State judicial service In 1990, Whittemore was elected to the bench of the Hillsborough County Circuit Court in the Florida Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, and remained on the court until 2000. He was named the 1998 Jurist of the Year by the Hillsborough County Bar Association, and Outstanding Jurist of 1999 by the Florida Bar's Young Lawyers Division. Federal judicial service After recommendation by both of Florida's United States Senators, Democrat Bob Graham and Republican Connie Mack III, he was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a new seat in the Florida Middle District Court on October 20, 1999. Whittemore was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 24, 2000, and received his commission the following day. He assumed senior status on August 29, 2017. Notable cases On June 4, 2001, Whittemore ruled against Rolando Viera, a Cuban baseball pitcher who was attempting to enjoin Major League Baseball from including him in its amateur draft so that he could instead be a free agent. Viera had claimed that the MLB draft was discriminatory because it had a different residency requirement for Cubans, but Whittemore decided that whatever financial loss Vierra suffered from being subject to the draft did not satisfy the federal injunction requirement of irreparable harm. Viera was picked by the Boston Red Sox that same week in the seventh round of the draft. Whittemore presided over the criminal trial of Gerald and Betty Payne, the founders of Greater Ministries International Church. Over $450 million was bilked from church followers in the Paynes' fraudulent investment scheme, which was billed as one of the largest Ponzi schemes in United States history. Whittemore sentenced Gerald to 27 years for conduct he called \\"absolutely despicable.\\" Betty was sentenced to over 12 years, which was increased from what Whittemore initially considered after she repeated a claim they were the innocent victims of government persecution and their religious freedoms were being violated. \\"It's one thing to have blind faith,\\" Whittemore told her. \\"It's quite another to cast yourself as a martyr for no apparent good. I just deliberated a matter that you could serve 33 months less. What you've just done is throw that right back in my face.\\" =Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo= Whittemore was randomly assigned to hear the Terri Schiavo case, a longstanding conflict between Schiavo's husband, Michael Schiavo, and her parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, over whether she should be removed from life support. The Schindlers disputed that their daughter was in a persistent vegetative state or that she would have wanted to have life support withdrawn, but Schiavo, his expert witnesses, and court-appointed physicians had successfully argued the contrary before Florida trial court judge, George Greer. The case had worked its way through Florida state courts since 1998, was denied review four times by the United States Supreme Court, and was unsuccessfully challenged by the Florida Legislature before Schiavo's feeding tube was ordered removed for the third time by Judge Greer. Shortly after midnight on March 21, 2005, the United States Congress passed an unprecedented law that gave the Middle District of Florida jurisdiction over the matter without any regard to previous state court decisions. While protesters demonstrated outside his courthouse, Whittemore conducted a hearing on the Schindler's amended complaint the same day the law was passed, but adjourned without issuing any orders as Schiavo's feeding tube remained removed for the third day. On March 22, Whittemore issued a thirteen-page ruling that denied a temporary restraining order (TRO) to replace the tube. As appropriate for the federal standard of review for a TRO motion, his ruling avoided the issue of whether the Congressional grant of jurisdiction was unconstitutional, as Michael Schiavo and most legal scholars had argued. Though three of the four elements of the federal TRO standard, including irreparable harm, were clearly satisfied by Schiavo's imminent death, Whittemore did not believe the Schindlers ultimately had a substantial likelihood of prevailing, but instead found each of their claims \\"without merit.\\" Because the due process and equal protection violations alleged in the Schindler's complaint were premised primarily on the procedures and orders in the Florida court proceedings, the state court history had to be considered by Whittemore despite the language of the congressional act, which called for a de novo review. Whittemore stated that the issues they raised had been \\"exhaustively litigated\\" and that Judge Greer had appropriately fulfilled his role as a judge under Florida and federal law. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed Whittemore's \\"carefully thought-out decision\\" in a 2-1 ruling on March 23, and denied rehearing en banc later the same day, 10-2. The United States Supreme Court also denied a stay without recorded dissent on March 24. The Schindlers returned to Whittemore's courtroom, again amended their complaint to add claims based on the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Eighth Amendment, and filed an amended motion for a TRO. Whittemore conducted a hearing on the motion the evening of March 24. When one of the Schindlers' attorneys described the removal of the feeding tube as \\"murder\\", Whittemore responded \\"[t]hat is the emotional rhetoric of this case. It does not influence this court and cannot influence this court. I want you to know it, and I want the public to know it.\\" During the hearing, the protesters that still surrounded the area outside the courthouse were temporarily evacuated, so that law enforcement could detonate a suspicious bag that turned out to be harmless. The hearing proceeded inside without interruption, and lasted around four hours. In an order issued the morning of March 25, Whittemore denied the Schindlers' amended motion. Regarding their ADA claim, Whittemore wrote that the law was inapplicable because Mr. Schiavo and the hospice in care of Terri Schiavo did not fall under the Act's definition of \\"public entities\\", nor was the withdrawal of the feeding tube based on discrimination against Schiavo on the basis of her disability. Their claim under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was similarly flawed, in that no discrimination was present, and the United States Supreme Court had previously ruled that the Act did not apply to medical decisions. Their Eighth Amendment claim was also rejected by Whittemore, because the amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment did not apply outside of criminal sanctions. Whittemore closed his order by conveying the court's \\"appreciation for the difficulties and heartbreak the parties have endured through this lengthy process.\\" A panel of the same three Circuit judges who heard the first appeal affirmed his decision once again on March 25, with the judge who had previously dissented concurring in this second opinion. Rehearing was once again denied by the Eleventh Circuit on March 30, and the Supreme Court also once again denied a stay the same day. The case ended with Schiavo's death on the morning of March 31.

HistoryEarly history= Engineered by Joseph Locke, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway linking Manchester and Sheffield opened in 1845. Originally, this line terminated at the Bridgehouses station about to the west of the future Victoria station. In 1847, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway merged with two other railway companies to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The station at Bridgehouses had been outgrown and an extension and new station were planned. John Fowler, who later gained fame for co-designing the Forth Railway Bridge in Scotland, was employed to engineer the extension and station. Fowler's design included a viaduct over the Wicker that was high, long and two island platforms long. The extension was completed in 1847‚Äì1848 and the new Victoria station opened on 15 September 1851. The station gained a -long ridge furrow patterned glass roof likened at the time to The Crystal Palace (in London) which spanned the main line platforms in 1867 and was further enlarged in 1874, the well-known railway contractors Logan and Hemingway being awarded the contract. With the opening of the London Extension in 1899, Sheffield gained a new direct service to London. To attract the lucrative trade between the cities, the Great Central Railway launched Sheffield Without A Stop on 1 July 1903 and became something of a trademark for the company, with being run in exactly 3 hours, an average of nearly . Slip coaches were provided for passengers for Leicester and Nottingham. The station received a new frontage in 1908 and was further improved between 1939 and 1940. The station took on great importance when the line through the Pennines‚Äîknown as the Woodhead Route after the long Woodhead Tunnel on it which was electrified for freight purposes after World War II. =Electrification= Sheffield Victoria railway station, September 1969, a westbound diesel-hauled train arrives at Platform 3, with an electric locomotive waiting to take the train on to Manchester The 1950s saw the station at its zenith: Regular Manchester London Road ‚Äì Sheffield Victoria ‚Äì London Marylebone express services traversed the Great Central line, other expresses ran to London King's Cross over the East Coast Main Line and the named expresses the Master Cutler, the Sheffield Pullman and the South Yorkshireman served the station. There were also many semi-fast trains running trans-Pennine from Manchester to destinations on the East Coast, and local trains to Chesterfield, Barnsley, Nottingham, Doncaster, Retford, Penistone and Lincoln. The electrification of the line reached Sheffield Victoria by 1954, reducing the journey time to Manchester to 56 minutes. This was the only main line electrified at 1500 V d.c. From this point onwards, all passenger trains heading to Manchester required a change of locomotive at Victoria to a British Rail Class 76 or express passenger British Rail Class 77. =Closure= The station after closure in 1971 Although the 1950s saw services at the station reach their peak, this period also marked the beginning of its decline. In 1953 Barnsley was an early casualty as the line ran almost parallel to the former Midland Railway's Sheffield Midland ‚Äì Barnsley line, serving mostly the same communities. By the end of the decade, the expresses to Marylebone were either cut or re-routed to King's Cross (in the case of the Master Cutler). In the mid-1960s there was a concerted effort to concentrate Victoria's remaining local and express train services at Sheffield (Midland) station. From 4 October 1965 most services were diverted to Sheffield Midland, adding 2 to 4 minutes to their schedules. The only trains remaining were Manchester via Woodhead, the Harwich boat train and trains to Bournemouth, York and Swindon.Modern Railways October 1965 p. 583 After September 1966, Victoria was left with just an hourly Manchester service and the daily Liverpool-Harwich \\"Continental\\" Boat train service. In 1965 the second Beeching Report recommended that the Sheffield to Manchester service be consolidated; after much local wrangling British Railways favoured the Hope Valley Line which was slower and not electrified but served more local communities. In 1967, plans were announced to withdraw passenger services along the Woodhead route. Following public outcry, an inquiry was launched that took two years to be completed. Eventually the inquiry backed British Rail's plans and passenger services were withdrawn from the line on 5 January 1970. The last train to Victoria station, an enthusiasts' special, arrived at 00:44 on 5 January and from that point the station was closed. Between 20 and 22 January 1973 the station was briefly reopened whilst Sheffield (Midland) station was completely closed for commissioning of the new power signaling box. The Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway was entirely closed east of Hadfield in July 1981; and the tracks through the Woodhead Tunnel were lifted in 1986. Passenger trains to and from via continued to pass through the station without stopping until May 1983, when they were diverted via Barnsley (the Penistone via Wadsley Bridge section then being closed to passenger traffic). Except for the now single track goods avoiding line, which still exists to serve the steelworks at Stocksbridge, all the track through the station was lifted by 1985Victoria Station, SheffieldSignalboxes.com; Retrieved 10 June 2016 and the station buildings were demolished in 1989 to make way for an extension to the adjacent Victoria Hotel complex. The slope that once led up to Platform 1 survives as part of a pedestrian path to the car park. =Preservation= Outlines of the platforms still remain, and the trackbed has been protected for a possible future extension of the Sheffield Supertram,Sheffield Victoria at Subterranea Britannica and may also be used for the proposed Don Valley Railway, which will terminate at Nunnery, linking into the Supertram approximately to the east where the proposed DVR will also interchange with train services on the Sheffield to Lincoln Line. =Future and potential reopening= It was suggested by Sheffield City Council that the site could be used for Sheffield's HS2 station, instead of the then planned station at Meadowhall, although an alternative route announced in 2016 would see HS2 using the existing Sheffield station, formerly known as Sheffield Midland station. In May 2020 as part of the Restoring Your Railway fund by the Department for Transport, it was announced that the Barrow Hill Line had been awarded funding for a feasibility study. If proven feasible, the line would initially run to Sheffield Midland but later phases could see services diverted to a reopened Sheffield Victoria with services running to Chesterfield (via the Barrow Hill Line) and services to Huddersfield (via a reopened Don Valley Line between and Sheffield) which would help free up capacity at for the additional services planned under HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail.

However, unlike other early deathrock bands such as Christian Death and 45 Grave, Super Heroines did not carry on a traditional Goth sound, instead a more punk style metal inspired by The Runaways. Its original lineup featured Eva O (guitar and vocals), Sandra Ross (bass), and Del Mar Richardson (drums). Other members of the group have included bassists Jill Emery and Edwin Borsheim. As well as drummers Steve Darrow and Cathy Falanga. Both Jill Emery and Eva O went on to play with Rozz Williams (from fellow Deathrock band Christian Death) in his next band, Shadow Project, during the 1990s. Eva O also played in Christian Death in the early 1980s and is currently the vocalist for Christian Death 1334, a touring and recording version of Christian Death with the members of the Only Theatre of Pain album. Emery also played bass with the Alternative rock band Hole on their 1991 debut album Pretty on the Inside, as well as playing bass in Mazzy Star and Teardrain. Del Mar Richardson, was a young actor before he entered the music scene. He later went on as session drummer for The Child Molesters Brown Album on \\"Diary of Madness\\" and \\"Espionage,\\" and as session drummer soon after with Rich LaBonte and Kim Fowley, in Los Angeles, CA. He later became an international fashion model and commercial actor. He was in \\"Do You Remember Love?\\" with Joanne Woodward (1985), \\"Who Wants To Be A Hero\\" starring Ike Eisenmann, and \\"Lying for A Living\\" (2002), as himself, in a documentary about the infamous acting course taught by Marlon Brando. He stars in the music video \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\" by Eagles (2008) and co-star in \\"Feel It All\\" by KT Tunstall (2013). After moving to Europe, he continued his career as a model, commercial actor and theatrical actor in the film Way Down released in November 2020, starring Freddie Highmore, Luis Tosar and Famke Janssen. He continues his work as an actor and radio producer for free-form radio storytelling. Darrow went on to play in Hollywood Rose, the pre-Guns N' Roses band that featured Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin. Before joining Super Heroines, Darrow played in punk trio The Decadents (later changed to 'The Decadent' ) with Jill Emery, from 1978-1982. Cathy Falanga disappeared from the LA music scene and re-appeared as Cat Noel at Vermont based radio station WEQX. She would later move to the Capital region of New York and become one half of the \\"Darwin and Cat\\" morning show on WZMR, the Edge, in New York. During her stint at The Edge, Noel appeared on ABC Television's Wife Swap as a shock jock who traded lives with a woman who ran a pet crematorium. She returned to Southern California shortly before The Edge became a country station called \\"The Cat\\". The Darwin and Cat Radio Show returned in January 2012 as an Internet-based show.

The festival was originally held at the famous CBGB punk rock club, but subsequent Drop Dead Festivals moved to the much larger Knitting Factory, also in lower Manhattan. Although the main event moved to larger locations, CBGB traditionally held pre-parties and after-parties for the festival until the club closed. In 2005, the Drop Dead Festival grew to four days, during Halloween week. Over 5,000 people attended this event, featuring headliner Nina Hagen.

The equivalent weight of an element is the mass which combines with or displaces 1.008 gram of hydrogen or 8.0 grams of oxygen or 35.5 grams of chlorine. These values correspond to the atomic weight divided by the usual valence;Equivalent weight chemistry Encyclop√¶dia Britannica for oxygen as example that is 16.0g / 2. For acid-base reactions, the equivalent weight of an acid or base is the mass which supplies or reacts with one mole of hydrogen cations (). For redox reactions, the equivalent weight of each reactant supplies or reacts with one mole of electrons (e‚àí) in a redox reaction. Equivalent weight has the dimensions and units of mass, unlike atomic weight, which is dimensionless. Equivalent weights were originally determined by experiment, but (insofar as they are still used) are now derived from molar masses. Additionally, the equivalent weight of a compound can be calculated by dividing the molecular mass by the number of positive or negative electrical charges that result from the dissolution of the compound.  In history  Jeremias Benjamin Richter (1762‚Äì1807), one of the first chemists to publish tables of equivalent weights, and also the coiner of the word \\"stoichiometry\\". The first equivalent weights were published for acids and bases by Carl Friedrich Wenzel in 1777. A larger set of tables was prepared, possibly independently, by Jeremias Benjamin Richter, starting in 1792. However, neither Wenzel nor Richter had a single reference point for their tables, and so had to publish separate tables for each pair of acid and base.Atome Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle (editeur Pierre Larousse, Paris 1866, vol.1, pages 868-73) John Dalton's first table of atomic weights (1808) suggested a reference point, at least for the elements: taking the equivalent weight of hydrogen to be one unit of mass. However, Dalton's atomic theory was far from universally accepted in the early 19th century. One of the greatest problems was the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to produce water. One gram of hydrogen reacts with eight grams of oxygen to produce nine grams of water, so the equivalent weight of oxygen was defined as eight grams. Since Dalton supposed (incorrectly) that a water molecule consisted of one hydrogen and one oxygen atom, this would imply an atomic weight of oxygen equal to eight. However, expressing the reaction in terms of gas volumes following Gay- Lussac's law of combining gas volumes, two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to produce two volumes of water, suggesting (correctly) that the atomic weight of oxygen is sixteen. The work of Charles Fr√©d√©ric Gerhardt (1816‚Äì56), Henri Victor Regnault (1810‚Äì78) and Stanislao Cannizzaro (1826‚Äì1910) helped to rationalise this and many similar paradoxes, but the problem was still the subject of debate at the Karlsruhe Congress (1860).See Charles-Adolphe Wurtz's report on the Karlsruhe Congress. Nevertheless, many chemists found equivalent weights to be a useful tool even if they did not subscribe to atomic theory. Equivalent weights were a useful generalisation of Joseph Proust's law of definite proportions (1794) that enabled chemistry to become a quantitative science. French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1800‚Äì84) became one of the more influential opponents of atomic theory, after having embraced it earlier in his career, but was a staunch supporter of equivalent weights. Equivalent weights were not without problems of their own. For a start, the scale based on hydrogen was not particularly practical, as most elements do not react directly with hydrogen to form simple compounds. However, one gram of hydrogen reacts with 8 grams of oxygen to give water or with 35.5 grams of chlorine to give hydrogen chloride: hence 8 grams of oxygen and 35.5 grams of chlorine can be taken to be equivalent to one gram of hydrogen for the measurement of equivalent weights. This system can be extended further through different acids and bases. Much more serious was the problem of elements which form more than one oxide or series of salts, which have (in today's terminology) different oxidation states. Copper will react with oxygen to form either brick red cuprous oxide (copper(I) oxide, with 63.5 g of copper for 8 g of oxygen) or black cupric oxide (copper(II) oxide, with 32.7 g of copper for 8 g of oxygen), and so has two equivalent weights. Supporters of atomic weights could turn to the Dulong‚ÄìPetit law (1819), which relates the atomic weight of a solid element to its specific heat capacity, to arrive at a unique and unambiguous set of atomic weights. Most supporters of equivalent weights‚Äîwhich were the great majority of chemists prior to 1860‚Äîsimply ignored the inconvenient fact that most elements exhibited multiple equivalent weights. Instead, these chemists had settled on a list of what were universally called \\"equivalents\\" (H = 1, O = 8, C = 6, S = 16, Cl = 35.5, Na = 23, Ca = 20, and so on). However, these nineteenth-century \\"equivalents\\" were not equivalents in the original or modern sense of the term. Since they represented dimensionless numbers that for any given element were unique and unchanging, they were in fact simply an alternative set of atomic weights, in which the elements of even valence have atomic weights one- half of the modern values. This fact was not recognized until much later.Alan J. Rocke, Chemical Atomism in the Nineteenth Century: From Dalton to Cannizzaro (Ohio State University Press, 1984). The final death blow for the use of equivalent weights for the elements was Dmitri Mendeleev's presentation of his periodic table in 1869, in which he related the chemical properties of the elements to the approximate order of their atomic weights. However, equivalent weights continued to be used for many compounds for another hundred years, particularly in analytical chemistry. Equivalent weights of common reagents could be tabulated, simplifying analytical calculations in the days before the widespread availability of electronic calculators: such tables were commonplace in textbooks of analytical chemistry.  Use in general chemistry  The use of equivalent weights in general chemistry has largely been superseded by the use of molar masses. Equivalent weights may be calculated from molar masses if the chemistry of the substance is well known: *sulfuric acid has a molar mass of 98.078(5) , and supplies two moles of hydrogen ions per mole of sulfuric acid, so its equivalent weight is 98.078(5) /2 = 49.039(3) . *potassium permanganate has a molar mass of 158.034(1) , and reacts with five moles of electrons per mole of potassium permanganate, so its equivalent weight is 158.034(1) /5 = 31.6068(3) . Historically, the equivalent weights of the elements were often determined by studying their reactions with oxygen. For example, 50 g of zinc will react with oxygen to produce 62.24 g of zinc oxide, implying that the zinc has reacted with 12.24 g of oxygen (from the Law of conservation of mass): the equivalent weight of zinc is the mass which will react with eight grams of oxygen, hence 50 g √ó 8 g/12.24 g = 32.7 g. Some contemporary general chemistry textbooks make no mention of equivalent weights. Others explain the topic, but point out that it is merely an alternate method of doing calculations using moles.  Use in volumetric analysis  Burette over a conical flask with phenolphthalein indicator used for acid-base titration. When choosing primary standards in analytical chemistry, compounds with higher equivalent weights are generally more desirable because weighing errors are reduced. An example is the volumetric standardisation of a solution of sodium hydroxide which has been prepared to approximately 0.1 . It is necessary to calculate the mass of a solid acid which will react with about 20 cm3 of this solution (for a titration using a 25 cm3 burette): suitable solid acids include oxalic acid dihydrate, potassium hydrogen phthalate and potassium hydrogen iodate. The equivalent weights of the three acids 63.04 g, 204.23 g and 389.92 g respectively, and the masses required for the standardisation are 126.1 mg, 408.5 mg and 779.8 mg respectively. Given that the measurement uncertainty in the mass measured on a standard analytical balance is ¬±0.1 mg, the relative uncertainty in the mass of oxalic acid dihydrate would be about one part in a thousand, similar to the measurement uncertainty in the volume measurement in the titration.ISO 385:2005 \\"Laboratory glassware ‚Äì burettes\\". However the measurement uncertainty in the mass of potassium hydrogen iodate would be five times lower, because its equivalent weight is five times higher: such an uncertainty in the measured mass is negligible in comparison to the uncertainty in the volume measured during the titration (see example below). For sake of example, it shall be assumed that 22.45¬±0.03 cm3 of the sodium hydroxide solution reacts with 781.4¬±0.1 mg of potassium hydrogen iodate. As the equivalent weight of potassium hydrogen iodate is 389.92 g, the measured mass is 2.004 milliequivalents. The concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution is therefore 2.004 meq/0.02245 l = 89.3 meq/l. In analytical chemistry, a solution of any substance which contains one equivalent per litre is known as a normal solution (abbreviated N), so the example sodium hydroxide solution would be 0.0893 N.The use of the term \\"normal solution\\" is no longer recommended by IUPAC. The relative uncertainty (ur) in the measured concentration can be estimated by assuming a Gaussian distribution of the measurement uncertainties: :\\\\begin{align} u_{\\\\rm r}^2 &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{u(V)}{V}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{u(m)}{m}\\\\right)^2  &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{0.03}{22.45}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{0.1}{781.4}\\\\right)^2  &= (0.001336)^2 + (0.000128)^2 u_{\\\\rm r} &= 0.00134  u(c) &= u_{\\\\rm r}c = 0.1\\\\ {\\\\rm meq/l} \\\\end{align} This sodium hydroxide solution can be used to measure the equivalent weight of an unknown acid. For example, if it takes 13.20¬±0.03 cm3 of the sodium hydroxide solution to neutralise 61.3¬±0.1 mg of an unknown acid, the equivalent weight of the acid is: :\\\\text{equivalent weight} = \\\\frac{m_\\\\ce{acid}}{c(\\\\ce{NaOH})V_\\\\ce{eq}} = 52.0\\\\pm 0.1\\\\ \\\\ce{g} Because each mole of acid can only release an integer number of moles of hydrogen ions, the molar mass of the unknown acid must be an integer multiple of 52.0¬±0.1 g.  Use in gravimetric analysis  Powdered bis(dimethylglyoximate)nickel. This coordination compound can be used for the gravimetric determination of nickel. The term ‚Äúequivalent weight‚Äù had a distinct sense in gravimetric analysis: it was the mass of precipitate which corresponds to one gram of analyte (the species of interest). The different definitions came from the practice of quoting gravimetric results as mass fractions of the analyte, often expressed as a percentage. A related term was the equivalence factor, one gram divided by equivalent weight, which was the numerical factor by which the mass of precipitate had to be multiplied to obtain the mass of analyte. For example, in the gravimetric determination of nickel, the molar mass of the precipitate bis(dimethylglyoximate)nickel [Ni(dmgH)2] is 288.915(7) , while the molar mass of nickel is 58.6934(2) : hence 288.915(7)/58.6934(2) = 4.9224(1) grams of [Ni(dmgH)2] precipitate is equivalent to one gram of nickel and the equivalence factor is 0.203151(5). For example, 215.3¬±0.1 mg of [Ni(dmgH)2] precipitate is equivalent to (215.3¬±0.1 mg) √ó 0.203151(5) = 43.74¬±0.2 mg of nickel: if the original sample size was 5.346¬±0.001 g, the nickel content in the original sample would be 0.8182¬±0.0004%. Gravimetric analysis is one of the most precise of the common methods of chemical analysis, but it is time-consuming and labour-intensive. It has been largely superseded by other techniques such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, in which the mass of analyte is read off from a calibration curve.  Use in polymer chemistry  Beads of an ion-exchange polymer. In polymer chemistry, the equivalent weight of a reactive polymer is the mass of polymer which has one equivalent of reactivity (often, the mass of polymer which corresponds to one mole of reactive side-chain groups). It is widely used to indicate the reactivity of polyol, isocyanate, or epoxy thermoset resins which would undergo crosslinking reactions through those functional groups. It is particularly important for ion-exchange polymers (also called ion-exchange resins): one equivalent of an ion-exchange polymer will exchange one mole of singly charged ions, but only half a mole of doubly charged ions. Nevertheless, given the decline in use of the term \\"equivalent weight\\" in the rest of chemistry, it has become more usual to express the reactivity of a polymer as the inverse of the equivalent weight, that is in units of mmol/g or meq/g.See, e.g.,  References  Category:Stoichiometry Category:Amount of substance Category:Polymer chemistry Category:Equivalent units es:Peso equivalente ","title":"Equivalent weight"},{"id":"1631902","text":"The Golden Dogs are a Canadian pop-rock band based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Mark Daniell. \\"T.O.'s Golden Dogs have 'Eye' on road\\".

Retrieved 2010-12-16. \\"The Golden Dogs probably have the best live show you can see in a medium-to-small sized venue anywhere.\\" History Dave Azzolini is the songwriting force, supported by wife Jessica Grassia on drums (formerly on keys). Together they produce the band's live shows and recorded music. Their debut album Everything in 3 Parts, released on True North Records in 2004, began their rising popularity in the Toronto indie scene with the single \\"YEAH!\\". More popularity would come in 2006 when the band released their second album with True North Records Big Eye Little Eye. The first two singles \\"Never Meant Any Harm\\" and \\"Construction Worker\\" were immortalized on video by French director Arno Salters. Big Eye Little Eye was released in the USA on August 16, 2007 on Yeproc Records. In 2008, the band had a busy year in the USA touring with the likes of, most notably, Feist, Sloan. Later in that year, the band parted ways with True North Records and spent most of 2009 writing and recording their third full- length album, Coat of Arms, which was recorded by Carlin Nicholson and Mike O'Brien, members of Zeus. Some members of The Golden Dogs appeared on much of Zeus' album Say Us. \\"Coat of Arms\\" was released on Nevado Records in Canada and Dine Alone Records in the USA. The band has shared the stage with several notable acts including Sloan, Feist, Joel Plaskett, The Meligrove Band, The Bicycles, The Kaiser Chiefs, Razorlight, Bloc Party, Blue Rodeo, Major Grange, Roky Erikson, Thurston Moore, Electric Six, The Willowz, Ida Maria, Malajube, Peter Elkas, Liam Finn, Bahamas, Zeus, White Cowbell Oklahoma, The Balconies, Hexes and Ohs, Rich Aucoin, Jason Collett, State Radio The band has welcomed two new members to their current line up while Grassia has moved from keyboards to the drum kit. The band is currently in production of their 4th studio album which is due to be released in the spring of 2014.

When the base space is a circle the total space is three-dimensional and is often called a surface bundle over the circle. See also *Mapping torus Category:Geometric topology ","title":"Surface bundle"},{"id":"1631931","text":"A Seifert fiber space is a 3-manifold together with a decomposition as a disjoint union of circles. In other words, it is a S^1-bundle (circle bundle) over a 2-dimensional orbifold. Many 3-manifolds are Seifert fiber spaces, and they account for all compact oriented manifolds in 6 of the 8 Thurston geometries of the geometrization conjecture. Definition A standard fibered torus corresponding to (5,2) is obtained by gluing the top of the cylinder to the bottom by a 2/5 rotation counterclockwise. A Seifert manifold is a closed 3-manifold together with a decomposition into a disjoint union of circles (called fibers) such that each fiber has a tubular neighborhood that forms a standard fibered torus. A standard fibered torus corresponding to a pair of coprime integers (a,b) with a>0 is the surface bundle of the automorphism of a disk given by rotation by an angle of 2œÄb/a (with the natural fibering by circles). If a = 1 the middle fiber is called ordinary, while if a>1 the middle fiber is called exceptional. A compact Seifert fiber space has only a finite number of exceptional fibers. The set of fibers forms a 2-dimensional orbifold, denoted by B and called the base -also called the orbit surface- of the fibration. It has an underlying 2-dimensional surface B0, but may have some special orbifold points corresponding to the exceptional fibers. The definition of Seifert fibration can be generalized in several ways. The Seifert manifold is often allowed to have a boundary (also fibered by circles, so it is a union of tori). When studying non-orientable manifolds, it is sometimes useful to allow fibers to have neighborhoods that look like the surface bundle of a reflection (rather than a rotation) of a disk, so that some fibers have neighborhoods looking like fibered Klein bottles, in which case there may be one-parameter families of exceptional curves. In both of these cases, the base B of the fibration usually has a non-empty boundary. Classification Herbert Seifert classified all closed Seifert fibrations in terms of the following invariants. Seifert manifolds are denoted by symbols :\\\\\\\\{b, (\\\\varepsilon,g);(a_1,b_1),\\\\dots,(a_r,b_r)\\\\\\\\}\\\\, where: \\\\varepsilon is one of the 6 symbols: o_1,o_2,n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4\\\\,, (or Oo, No, NnI, On, NnII, NnIII in Seifert's original notation) meaning: *o_1 if B is orientable and M is orientable. *o_2 if B is orientable and M is not orientable. *n_1 if B is not orientable and M is not orientable and all generators of \\\\pi_1(B) preserve orientation of the fiber. *n_2 if B is not orientable and M is orientable, so all generators of \\\\pi_1(B) reverse orientation of the fiber. *n_3 if B is not orientable and M is not orientable and g\\\\ge 2 and exactly one generator of \\\\pi_1(B) preserves orientation of the fiber. *n_4 if B is not orientable and M is not orientable and g\\\\ge 3 and exactly two generators of \\\\pi_1(B) preserve orientation of the fiber. Here *g is the genus of the underlying 2-manifold of the orbit surface. *b is an integer, normalized to be 0 or 1 if M is not orientable and normalized to be 0 if in addition some a_i is 2. *(a_1,b_1),\\\\ldots,(a_r,b_r) are the pairs of numbers determining the type of each of the r exceptional orbits. They are normalized so that 0< b_i < a_i when M is orientable, and 0< b_i \\\\le a_i/2 when M is not orientable. The Seifert fibration of the symbol :\\\\\\\\{b, (\\\\epsilon,g);(a_1,b_1),\\\\ldots ,(a_r,b_r)\\\\\\\\} can be constructed from that of symbol :\\\\\\\\{0, (\\\\epsilon,g);\\\\\\\\} by using surgery to add fibers of types b and b_i/a_i. If we drop the normalization conditions then the symbol can be changed as follows: *Changing the sign of both a_i and b_i has no effect. *Adding 1 to b and subtracting a_i from b_i has no effect. (In other words, we can add integers to each of the rational numbers (b,b_1/a_1, \\\\ldots ,b_r/a_r provided that their sum remains constant.) *If the manifold is not orientable, changing the sign of b_i has no effect. *Adding a fiber of type (1,0) has no effect. Every symbol is equivalent under these operations to a unique normalized symbol. When working with unnormalized symbols, the integer b can be set to zero by adding a fiber of type (1,b). Two closed Seifert oriented or non-orientable fibrations are isomorphic as oriented or non-orientable fibrations if and only if they have the same normalized symbol. However, it is sometimes possible for two Seifert manifolds to be homeomorphic even if they have different normalized symbols, because a few manifolds (such as lens spaces) can have more than one sort of Seifert fibration. Also an oriented fibration under a change of orientation becomes the Seifert fibration whose symbol has the sign of all the bs changed, which after normalization gives it the symbol :\\\\\\\\{-b-r, (\\\\epsilon,g);(a_1,a_1-b_1),\\\\ldots,(a_r,a_r-b_r)\\\\\\\\} and it is homeomorphic to this as an unoriented manifold. The sum b+\\\\sum b_i/a_i is an invariant of oriented fibrations, which is zero if and only if the fibration becomes trivial after taking a finite cover of B. The orbifold Euler characteristic \\\\chi(B) of the orbifold B is given by :\\\\chi(B) = \\\\chi(B_0) - \\\\sum(1-1/a_i), where \\\\chi(B_0) is the usual Euler characteristic of the underlying topological surface B_0 of the orbifold B. The behavior of M depends largely on the sign of the orbifold Euler characteristic of B. Fundamental group The fundamental group of M fits into the exact sequence :\\\\pi_1(S^1)\\\\rightarrow\\\\pi_1(M)\\\\rightarrow\\\\pi_1(B)\\\\rightarrow1 where œÄ1(B) is the orbifold fundamental group of B (which is not the same as the fundamental group of the underlying topological manifold). The image of group œÄ1(S1) is cyclic, normal, and generated by the element h represented by any regular fiber, but the map from œÄ1(S1) to œÄ1(M) is not always injective. The fundamental group of M has the following presentation by generators and relations: B orientable: :\\\\langle u_1,v_1,...u_g,v_g,q_1,...q_r,hu_ih=h^{\\\\epsilon}u_i, v_ih=h^{\\\\epsilon}v_i,q_ih=hq_i, q_j^{a_j}h^{b_j}=1, q_1...q_r[u_1,v_1]...[u_g,v_g]=h^b\\\\rangle where Œµ is 1 for type o1, and is ‚àí1 for type o2. B non-orientable: :\\\\langle v_1,...,v_g,q_1,...q_r,h v_ih=h^{\\\\epsilon_i}v_i,q_ih=hq_i, q_j^{a_j}h^{b_j}=1, q_1...q_rv_1^2...v_g^2=h^b\\\\rangle where Œµi is 1 or ‚àí1 depending on whether the corresponding generator vi preserves or reverses orientation of the fiber. (So Œµi are all 1 for type n1, all ‚àí1 for type n2, just the first one is one for type n3, and just the first two are one for type n4.) Positive orbifold Euler characteristic The normalized symbols of Seifert fibrations with positive orbifold Euler characteristic are given in the list below. These Seifert manifolds often have many different Seifert fibrations. They have a spherical Thurston geometry if the fundamental group is finite, and an S2√óR Thurston geometry if the fundamental group is infinite. Equivalently, the geometry is S2√óR if the manifold is non-orientable or if b + Œ£bi/ai= 0, and spherical geometry otherwise. {b; (o1, 0);} (b integral) is S2√óS1 for b=0, otherwise a lens space L(b,1). In particular, {1; (o1, 0);} =L(1,1) is the 3-sphere. {b; (o1, 0);(a1, b1)} (b integral) is the lens space L(ba1+b1,a1). {b; (o1, 0);(a1, b1), (a2, b2)} (b integral) is S2√óS1 if ba1a2+a1b2+a2b1 = 0, otherwise the lens space L(ba1a2+a1b2+a2b1, ma2+nb2) where ma1 ‚àí n(ba1 +b1) = 1. {b; (o1, 0);(2, 1), (2, 1), (a3, b3)} (b integral) This is the prism manifold with fundamental group of order 4a3(b+1)a3+b3 and first homology group of order 4(b+1)a3+b3. {b; (o1, 0);(2, 1), (3, b2), (3, b3)} (b integral) The fundamental group is a central extension of the tetrahedral group of order 12 by a cyclic group. {b; (o1, 0);(2, 1), (3, b2), (4, b3)} (b integral) The fundamental group is the product of a cyclic group of order 12b+6+4b2 \\\\+ 3b3 and a double cover of order 48 of the octahedral group of order 24. {b; (o1, 0);(2, 1), (3, b2), (5, b3)} (b integral) The fundamental group is the product of a cyclic group of order m=30b+15+10b2 +6b3 and the order 120 perfect double cover of the icosahedral group. The manifolds are quotients of the Poincar√© homology sphere by cyclic groups of order m. In particular, {‚àí1; (o1, 0);(2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1)} is the Poincar√© sphere. {b; (n1, 1);} (b is 0 or 1.) These are the non-orientable 3-manifolds with S2√óR geometry. If b is even this is homeomorphic to the projective plane times the circle, otherwise it is homeomorphic to a surface bundle associated to an orientation reversing automorphism of the 2-sphere. {b; (n1, 1);(a1, b1)} (b is 0 or 1.) These are the non-orientable 3-manifolds with S2√óR geometry. If ba1+b1 is even this is homeomorphic to the projective plane times the circle, otherwise it is homeomorphic to a surface bundle associated to an orientation reversing automorphism of the 2-sphere. {b; (n2, 1);} (b integral.) This is the prism manifold with fundamental group of order 4b and first homology group of order 4, except for b=0 when it is a sum of two copies of real projective space, and b=1 when it is the lens space with fundamental group of order 4. {b; (n2, 1);(a1, b1)} (b integral.) This is the (unique) prism manifold with fundamental group of order 4a1ba1 \\\\+ b1 and first homology group of order 4a1. Zero orbifold Euler characteristic The normalized symbols of Seifert fibrations with zero orbifold Euler characteristic are given in the list below. The manifolds have Euclidean Thurston geometry if they are non-orientable or if b + Œ£bi/ai= 0, and nil geometry otherwise. Equivalently, the manifold has Euclidean geometry if and only if its fundamental group has an abelian group of finite index. There are 10 Euclidean manifolds, but four of them have two different Seifert fibrations. All surface bundles associated to automorphisms of the 2-torus of trace 2, 1, 0, ‚àí1, or ‚àí2 are Seifert fibrations with zero orbifold Euler characteristic (the ones for other (Anosov) automorphisms are not Seifert fiber spaces, but have sol geometry). The manifolds with nil geometry all have a unique Seifert fibration, and are characterized by their fundamental groups. The total spaces are all acyclic. {b; (o1, 0); (3, b1), (3, b2), (3, b3)} (b integral, bi is 1 or 2) For b + Œ£bi/ai= 0 this is an oriented Euclidean 2-torus bundle over the circle, and is the surface bundle associated to an order 3 (trace ‚àí1) rotation of the 2-torus. {b; (o1, 0); (2,1), (4, b2), (4, b3)} (b integral, bi is 1 or 3) For b + Œ£bi/ai= 0 this is an oriented Euclidean 2-torus bundle over the circle, and is the surface bundle associated to an order 4 (trace 0) rotation of the 2-torus. {b; (o1, 0); (2, 1), (3, b2), (6, b3)} (b integral, b2 is 1 or 2, b3 is 1 or 5) For b + Œ£bi/ai= 0 this is an oriented Euclidean 2-torus bundle over the circle, and is the surface bundle associated to an order 6 (trace 1) rotation of the 2-torus. {b; (o1, 0); (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1)} (b integral) These are oriented 2-torus bundles for trace ‚àí2 automorphisms of the 2-torus. For b=‚àí2 this is an oriented Euclidean 2-torus bundle over the circle (the surface bundle associated to an order 2 rotation of the 2-torus) and is homeomorphic to {0; (n2, 2);}. {b; (o1, 1); } (b integral) This is an oriented 2-torus bundle over the circle, given as the surface bundle associated to a trace 2 automorphism of the 2-torus. For b=0 this is Euclidean, and is the 3-torus (the surface bundle associated to the identity map of the 2-torus). {b; (o2, 1); } (b is 0 or 1) Two non- orientable Euclidean Klein bottle bundles over the circle. The first homology is Z+Z+Z/2Z if b=0, and Z+Z if b=1. The first is the Klein bottle times S1 and other is the surface bundle associated to a Dehn twist of the Klein bottle. They are homeomorphic to the torus bundles {b; (n1, 2);}. {0; (n1, 1); (2, 1), (2, 1)} Homeomorphic to the non-orientable Euclidean Klein bottle bundle {1; (n3, 2);}, with first homology Z + Z/4Z. {b; (n1, 2); } (b is 0 or 1) These are the non-orientable Euclidean surface bundles associated with orientation reversing order 2 automorphisms of a 2-torus with no fixed points. The first homology is Z+Z+Z/2Z if b=0, and Z+Z if b=1. They are homeomorphic to the Klein bottle bundles {b; (o2, 1);}. {b; (n2, 1); (2, 1), (2, 1)} (b integral) For b=‚àí1 this is oriented Euclidean. {b; (n2, 2); } (b integral) For b=0 this is an oriented Euclidean manifold, homeomorphic to the 2-torus bundle {‚àí2; (o1, 0); (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1)} over the cicle associated to an order 2 rotation of the 2-torus. {b; (n3, 2); } (b is 0 or 1) The other two non-orientable Euclidean Klein bottle bundles. The one with b = 1 is homeomorphic to {0; (n1, 1); (2, 1), (2, 1)}. The first homology is Z+Z/2Z+Z/2Z if b=0, and Z+Z/4Z if b=1. These two Klein bottle bundle are surface bundles associated to the y-homeomorphism and the product of this and the twist. Negative orbifold Euler characteristic This is the general case. All such Seifert fibrations are determined up to isomorphism by their fundamental group. The total spaces are aspherical (in other words all higher homotopy groups vanish). They have Thurston geometries of type the universal cover of SL2(R), unless some finite cover splits as a product, in which case they have Thurston geometries of type H2√óR. This happens if the manifold is non-orientable or b + Œ£bi/ai= 0.

From left to right; White Man Runs Him, Hairy Moccasin, Curly and Goes Ahead. Goes Ahead (1851 - May 31, 1919) was a Crow scout for George Armstrong Custer‚Äôs 7th Cavalry during the 1876 campaign against the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne. He was a survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and his accounts of the battle are valued by modern historians.  Biography  Born into the Crow tribe, he was also known as the First One, Goes First, the One Ahead, Comes Leading, Man With Fur Belt, and Walks Among the Stars. At age 16, he married Pretty Shield. Goes Ahead volunteered on about April 10, 1876 to serve as a scout with units of the 7th Infantry of the United States Army against the traditional enemies of the Crow, the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne. On June 21, at the mouth of Rosebud Creek, six Crow scouts were detached from the 7th Infantry to go with Custer's Seventh Cavalry following the trail of a large Indian encampment up the Rosebud Creek valley. The six scouts included Goes Ahead, Hairy Moccasin, White Man Runs Him, Curly, White Swan, and Half Yellow Face (leader of the scouts). Custer's 7th Cavalry, about 650 men, were ordered to find and then engage a gathering of Sioux and Cheyenne who were expected to be on either Rosebud Creek or in the Little Bighorn valley. The six Crow scouts were sent with Custer because they were familiar with the Rosebud and Little Big Horn drainage. On June 24, 1876 the Crow scouts were ranging ahead, and they sent back word to Custer that the trail of the Sioux/Cheyenne encampment had moved from the Rosebud valley toward the valley of the Little Bighorn. At first light on June 25, 1876, the morning of the battle, the Crow scouts were at a high point (later known as the Crows Nest) on the divide between Rosebud Creek, and the Little Big Horn. Looking sixteen miles to the west, the scouts sighted indications of a very large encampment of Sioux/Cheyenne in the valley of the Little Big Horn River near the current site of Crow Agency, Montana, though the village itself was out of sight on the valley floor. Goes Ahead and the other scouts warned Custer of the indications of the very large size of the encampment. However, Custer had also received word that morning that his force of 650 men had been sighted by Sioux/Cheyenne warriors. Custer was concerned that if he did not immediately move to the attack, the village would scatter and disperse, denying the army the armed confrontation it sought with the Sioux/Cheyenne forces. Goes Ahead and the others took off their Army issued uniforms and put on traditional Crow clothing with eagle feathers to assist their flight to the spirit world should they be killed. When Custer saw this, he was enraged seeing the move as defeatism and he dismissed the scouts. Goes Ahead and the others joined Major Marcus Reno on the ridge overlooking the last stand. Attacked but not overrun, most of Reno‚Äôs men survived the engagement. According to Pretty Shield, Goes Ahead fell back and fought alongside some packers shielded by mule carcasses but had been an eyewitness to Custer's death at the sides of Mitch Boyer and a flag-bearer; she narrates among many other details, \\"My man, Goes-ahead, was with Son-of-the-morning-star when he rode down to the water of the Little Bighorn. He heard a Lacota call out to Two-bodies [i.e. according to Frank Bird Linderman, Boyer], who rode beside Son-of-the-morning-star, 'Go back, or you will die.' But Son-of-the-morning-star went ahead,..and he died there, died in the water of the Little Bighorn [emphasis original].... [He] told me that he was afraid; and yet he did not run away until he saw Son-of-the- morning star fall down from his horse into the water of the Little Bighorn. He told me that Son-of-the-morning star was ahead of his men, and that when he fell, the blue horse-soldiers ran back up the hill. He took me to the place, and showed me exactly where Son-of-the-morning-star fell into the water, with Two-bodies and the flag.... .Frank Bird Linderman, Pretty-shield: Medicine Woman of the Crows. (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 2003 ), pp. 135-6. After the battle, Goes Ahead settled on the Crow reservation, married and raised a family. He was interviewed by historian and photographer Edward S. Curtis in the early 20th century. His book was one of the first to present a balanced account of the battle to the general public, but even then, the more controversial parts of his story were not disclosed. The whole account of Curtis's interviews with Goes Ahead and the other Crow scouts would not become general knowledge until Curtis's notes became public in the 1990s, more than 40 years after his death. Goes Ahead died in 1919 and was buried in the military cemetery at the Little Big Horn Battlefield. His widow, Pretty Shield, became a sought after source of information concerning the battle late in her life.

Stembridge previously worked in Athens, Georgia punk band Vomit Thrower and low-fi indiepop group The Girl Pool during the 1990s. After attending the inaugural Drop Dead Festival in 2003, Stembridge's interest in music was reinvigorated. She began writing songs and eventually decided on the name Tears for the Dying. Music style The music of Tears for the Dying was influenced by early 1980s Southern California punk and 1960s proto punk and psychedelia. Frequent tempo changes and sometimes complex (if not awkward) arrangements are found in many of the band's songs. Lyrics range from youthful silliness to metaphysical. HistoryEarly recordings= In December 2003 Stembridge hired Radium Recordings in Athens, Georgia to record two songs, \\"Time\\" and \\"Disease.\\" She played all instruments and sung on both tracks. Using these songs and three others recorded at home on a four-track Tears for the Dying released its first demo CD, E.P.. The demo was mailed to a handful of interested people, one of whom was noted Goth music historian Mick Mercer (who later gave a positive review of the demo in his online journal). Months later, Gothic metal band Bury Me Under assisted Tears for the Dying with recording a new studio demo. Bury Me Under's drummer, Chris, provided the percussion. Stembridge played and sung the rest. Four songs were recorded: \\"Go Die\\", \\"Memories\\", \\"Disease\\" and \\"All for Nothing\\". These tracks, along with the Radium Recording session and several other unpublished songs, were eventually released under the title To the Birds. Stembridge and Dara packaged hundreds of copies of To the Birds in black mailers wrapped in mesh and lace, and enclosed liner notes on parchment with burned edges. Drawing from punk ethos, To the Birds was freely given to all who asked. Copies were sent all over the United States and around the world.

Havering Palace was an old royal residence in England. Between its building before 1066 until its abandonment in 1686 it was in the village of Havering-atte-Bower (in the London Borough of Havering, before 1965 in Essex). By 1816 no walls remained above ground. It stood to the north and west of Havering's parish church of St John the Evangelist, which was one of the palace‚Äôs chapels. History The associated church, today The earliest references to a royal demesne at Havering date from the time of Edward the Confessor, and although there is no definite proof that he ever visited it, the strength of local legend suggests he did. It was definitely a royal manor by the Norman Conquest when it passed to William the Conqueror. The royal manor also gave the surrounding area the designation of the Royal Liberty of Havering, which gave those living in the area freedom from taxation and other benefits. The manor was granted to Queen Eleanor by Henry III in 1262 and thereafter usually belonged to the queen consort or dowager (the queen mother) until the death of Jane Seymour in 1537,A History of the County of Essex: Volume 7 (1978), pp. 9-17, Parishes: Havering-atte- Bower . Date accessed: Wednesday, October 10, 2007 leading to the 'Bower' portion of the village's place name. A house was already there by the 12th Century, and extensive building took place in the 13th Century. Many royalty from then on are recorded as having stayed there, James I being the last to do so regularly. In 1358 Edward III held a 5-month Marshalsea Court at Havering Palace for locals to air their personal grievances, an unusual act since the Marshalsea Court was reserved for the royal household. By the 17th Century it was in poor condition, and Charles I was the last monarch to stay there in 1638. After the Restoration the house (by then called Havering House) was occupied by the Earl of Lindsey but despite evidence of considerable sums of money being spent on repairs, it became vacant some time between 1686 and 1719, when it was reported to be in ruins. Stone from it may subsequently have been used for other local buildings, as by 1816 no walls were visible above ground. Description At its greatest extent before decay set in, most of the palace dated from the major building works of the 13th century with a newer block built in 1576-7. The plan was irregular, containing a great chamber, royal apartments, two chapels, and various out-buildings. The parkland surrounding it covered most of the former parish of Havering-atte- Bower west of the main road (now North Road) and was much more extensive than the current Havering Country Park, which covers the part of the former park adjoining the site of the palace and is the 18th-highest hill in London.

After he realized there was public support, Roberts unsuccessfully appealed to contemporary animal welfare groups to campaign against factory farming. Undeterred, Roberts began his own campaign. Roberts retired in 1991. He was replaced as Chief Executive by Joyce D'Silva, who served until 2005 and now serves as ambassador. Philip Lymbery, co-author of Farmageddon, is the current Chief Executive. CIWF has offices in the UK, Italy, Netherlands, France, Poland, the United States, Brussels and China. Representatives are located in Czech Republic, Spain, Germany, South Africa, and Sweden. CIWF was responsible for the veal crate ban in the UK, as well as bans on narrow stalls and chains on pregnant sows. The European Union recognised animals as sentient beings as a result of their petition.  Activism  Compassion in World Farming does not support violence or threats; rather, it campaigns peacefully for the humane treatment of farm animals, which members accept will be killed and eaten. The London Evening Standard has called it \\"the most rational of the groups that campaign about animal welfare and the environment.\\" In addition to advocacy, it produces educational material for school children, and has fought against what it calls industry-sponsored propaganda. To celebrate and promote good animal welfare practices, it presents awards including the Good Egg, Good Chicken, Good Dairy, and Good Pig. Its undercover investigations have revealed animal cruelty to hens, cattle, pigs, and sheep. CIWF advocates free range systems, but accepts straw-bedded indoor systems for pigs. It has warned about factory farming of dairy cattle, which it says is neither economically beneficial for farmers nor healthy for cows. It has advocated a complete ban on fur farming in Ireland, which it describes as \\"one of the most serious animal welfare problems facing Ireland today\\". In 2002, it called for a global moratorium on all experimental or commercial cloning of farm animals. It opposes the practice of live export of farm animals for slaughter, instead advocating that the animals be slaughtered before transport. In support of this position, its supporters have demonstrated in London, Ipswich, Belfast, Ramsgate, and Dover. It has also campaigned to maintain a ban on the live transport of horses. It supports a ban on foie gras, calling this \\"an example of intensive farming at its worst\\". Celebrity supporters have included Joanna Lumley, who spoke against long distance animal transport, and Paul McCartney, who advocated for reduced consumption of meat products. In 2010, Jo Brand, Bill Oddie, Zac Goldsmith, Marc Abraham, and William Roache endorsed CIWF's protest against factory farming of cattle by Nocton Dairies. Early supporters include Spike Milligan and Celia Hammond, who protested against battery cages.  Awards  In 2007, CIWF won the BBC Radio 4 Food and Farming Award for the best food campaigner/educator. In 2009, it won the Broadcast Digital Award for Best Use of Interactive for their Chicken Out! website. In 2011, it won a Third Sector Excellence Award for its annual review and The Observers Ethical Award for Campaigner of the Year.

At that time formal programmes of training for teachers of English as a Foreign Language were almost non-existent.Obituary: John Haycraft, The Independent, Tuesday, 28 May 1996 John Haycraft was the first to introduce formalised teacher training in 1962, and the course International House developed in the 1960s and 1970s became first the Royal Society of Arts Certificate in teaching English, and then the current CELTA training course organised by Cambridge ESOL. Teaching at International House schools broadly follows what is often called the \\"communicative method\\", which focuses on student to student interaction as opposed to the teacher-centred approach of traditional language teaching. However, since the mid-nineties, this has been augmented into what is called 'principled eclecticism' to incorporate lexical, task-based and generally more 'function-based' approaches to language learning and teaching.  The International House affiliate network  All International House schools are independently owned affiliates which share the same philosophy, branding and many resources. All affiliates are regularly inspected by International House World Organisation approved inspectors for quality control purposes. Administration and control of the Organisation is maintained through a Board of Directors, an Executive Director and a Chief Operations Officer and staff. The International House World Organisation also arranges annual academic and management conferences for affiliate Teachers and Directors.

Depending on the version it produced between 610 and 730 PS and can be considered a counterpart of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel in many ways. Although originally intended to be used in almost all pre-war designs, rapid progress in aircraft design quickly relegated it to the small end of the power scale by the late 1930s. Almost all aircraft designs switched to the much larger Daimler-Benz DB 600, so the 210 was produced only for a short time before Junkers responded with a larger engine of their own, the Junkers Jumo 211. Design and development The first gasoline-burning aviation power plants that the Junkers Motorenwerke ever built were the L1 and L2 single overhead camshaft (SOHC) liquid-cooled inline-six aviation engines of the early and mid-1920s. Development of this line led up through the L8. All of these were developments of the BMW IIIa inline-six SOHC German World War I aviation engine, which BMW allowed as they were no longer interested in development of their WWI designs. The Junkers L55 engine, however, was the very first V12 layout aviation powerplant of any type created by the Junkers firm, using a pair of the earlier straight-six L5 engines as a basis for an \\"upright\\" liquid-cooled V12 aviation engine, as the contemporary BMW VI engine already was. Development of the Jumo 210 itself started in 1931 under the designation L10. The L10 was Germany's first truly modern engine design, featuring three valves per cylinder, an inverted-V layout, a supercharger as standard equipment, and a cast cylinder block. The 210 was odd in that the cylinders were machined into a block along with one side of the crankcase, two such parts being bolted together side-by-side to form the engine. Normal construction techniques used three parts, two cylinder blocks and a separate crankcase. The L10 was first ran in static tests on October 22, 1932. With the official formation of the RLM in 1933, numerical engine designations by manufacturer was rationalized with Junkers receiving the \\"200 block\\", the L10 becoming the 210. Type approval was achieved in March 1934, and it first flew on July 5, 1934 installed in a Junkers W33. The design had initially aimed for 700 PS, but the prototypes delivered only about 600 PS, so there was some disappointment in the industry. Nevertheless, almost all German aircraft designs of the era were based on the 210, which is why they were so small compared to other countries' efforts. Initial production of the 610 PS (602 hp, 449 kW) Jumo 210A started in late 1934. Further development led in 1935 to the 640 PS (631 hp, 471 kW) 210B and 210C. Both added a new supercharger for improved performance, along with a dump valve to avoid overboost. The B model had its propeller geared at 1:1.55 (prop:engine rpm) for high-speed use, while the C model was geared at 1:1.63 for slower flying speeds. In 1936 the new 670 PS (661 hp, 493 kW) 210D and 210E were introduced, which had the same gearing as the B and C but used a new two-speed supercharger to increase takeoff power and altitude performance. The Jumo 210G had a direct injection system developed by August Lichte. The Jumo system used a small pump piston positioned beside each of the main cylinders, driven off the crank shaft. The injector used a simple check valve to prevent internal pressure from blowing back into the fuel line, and the pump was timed to inject at the proper point in the intake cycle. Inclusion of the injection system increased takeoff performance by about 20 PS without increasing boost rates and it also reduced fuel consumption. For those reasons most newer German engine types were set up with fuel injection systems. The Jumo 210G was rated at 730 PS (720 hp, 534 kW) and was only available for fast aircraft like the Bf 109 and Bf 110 but not for slow aircraft like the Ju 87. Further developments were planned as Jumo 210F and 210H, but never built. In 1935 the Jumo 210H, with twin exhaust valves for each cylinder, was used for development of the Jumo 211. The Jumo 210-S was a special development by the DVL with rotary disc valves, as used in KM-8 torpedo engine. Production of the Jumo 210 came to an end in about 1938.

The Discourses were published posthumously with papal privilege in 1531. The title identifies the work's subject as the first ten books of Livy's Ab urbe condita,Livy, Ab urbe condita libri which relate the expansion of Rome through the end of the Third Samnite War in 293 BCE, although Machiavelli discusses what can be learned from many other eras including contemporary politics. Machiavelli saw history in general as a way to learn useful lessons from the past for the present, and also as a type of analysis which could be built upon, as long as each generation did not forget the works of the past. Machiavelli frequently describes Romans and other ancient peoples as superior models for his contemporaries, but he also describes political greatness as something which comes and goes amongst peoples, in cycles. Outline Discourses on Livy comprises a dedication letter and three books with 142 numbered chapters. The first two books (but not the third) are introduced by unnumbered prefaces. A good deal has been made of the coincidence that Livy's history also contained 142 books in addition to its introduction and other numerological curiosities that turn up in Machiavelli's writings. Machiavelli says that the first book will discuss things that happened inside of Rome as the result of public counsel (I 1.6), the second, decisions made by the Roman people pertaining to the increase of its empire (II Pr.3), and the third, how the actions of particular men made Rome great (III 1.6). =Dedicatory letter= Machiavelli dedicates the Discourses to two friends, Zanobi Buondelmonti and Cosimo Rucellai, both of whom appear in Machiavelli's Art of War. Rucellai had died in 1519, but this did not lead Machiavelli to find a new dedicatee, as he had with The Prince. Machiavelli justifies dedicating the Discourses to his two friends because they deserve to be princes, even if they lack principalities, and he criticizes the custom (which he had adopted in The Prince) of dedicating works to men who are princes but do not deserve to be. =Book I= Machiavelli notes that Rome's actions as recounted by Livy proceeded either by \\"public counsel\\" or by \\"private counsel,\\" and that they concerned either things inside the city or things outside the city, yielding four possible combinations. He says that he will restrict himself in Book I to those things that occurred inside the city and by public counsel.I 1.6 In the preface to Book I, Machiavelli explains why he wrote the Discourse, noting that he brings new modes and orders‚Äîa dangerous task given the envy of men, but one motivated by the desire to work for the common benefit of humanity. He also notes that while his work may not be perfect, it deserves to be heard, because it will aid others after him in fulfilling his vision. He complains that the Italian Renaissance has stimulated a desire to imitate the ancients in art, law, and medicine, but that no one thinks of imitating ancient kingdoms or republics. He traces this to an improper reading of history that suggests that imitation of ancient political virtue is impossible. He declares his intention to overcome this view of the ancient world by examining Livy and modern politics. Types of governments and rulers Book I begins by explaining how a city is formed, which is done by either natives to the area or foreigners, citing specific examples such as Athens and Venice. Machiavelli then explains this idea and states that this greatly changes the way a city is viewed, in particular for Rome. He states that there are six main different types of government, three of which are good, but \\"no precaution will prevent it from slipping into its opposite, so closely are the virtues and vices of the two related.\\" Namely, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy will become tyranny, oligarchy, and anarchy, respectively. Machiavelli then tries to determine what type of government Rome was; he says it was a republic, mixing all three functional political systems together, which kept the violent tendencies of one another in check. Machiavelli then delves into more historical events. Once the Tarquins left Rome there seemed to be peace and alliance between the patricians and the plebs, but this in fact was untrue. This disunity resulted in Rome evolving into a Republic. Moving on, he says that a republic has the opportunity to emerge as an empire, like Rome, or just maintain what it is. Also, allowing people to accuse other citizens is necessary in creating a republic, but calumnies, whispered allegations that cannot be proven or disproven in a court, are harmful because they cause mistrust and help create factionalism. Machiavelli then goes into how a founder of a republic must \\"act alone\\" and gain absolute power to form a lasting regime. He cites Romulus's murder of his own brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius in order to gain power. Machiavelli then excuses Romulus for his crimes, saying he acted for the common good in bringing \\"civil life\\". Machiavelli ranks then which rulers are most praiseworthy, the first of which being leaders who lead due to religion, then those who lead because they created a republic or kingdom. Religion in Rome was cited as a primary cause for joy in the city as it is truly an important element. He also states that Livy gives many examples of when religion was utilized to restructure the city. He says Numa Pompilius was more important to Rome than Romulus for bringing the kingdom to arms by using religion. While Machiavelli believes that religion is absolutely necessary for maintaining a government, he also believes in the power and influence of fortune, without which the Roman government would have never broken from the cycle of government demonstrated by Polybius. Fortune acts similarly to the activity of gods, yet it is different in that it exists naturally and benefits those who demonstrate virtue. He criticizes the Catholic Church's ineffectiveness in unifying Italy, writing: The Samnites were defeated by the Romans several times and in order to change this they decided find a new approach to their religion. On corruption and reform Machiavelli speaks on corruption, and how hard it is to sustain a republic where it has recently been freed from monarchy. He says that to sustain a republic in a newly freed city, it is necessary to \\"Kill the sons of Brutus\\", make violent examples out of the enemies of the free regime, citing Brutus's execution of his sons as an example. He also gives similar advice to \\"princes who have become tyrants of their fatherlands\\". Machiavelli then states that to keep a corrupt republic free, it is necessary to use extraordinary means. Discussing then freedom, Machiavelli explains that freedom becomes an issue once a type of government shifts. He explains that the Romans were not corrupt when they regained their freedom and could thus keep it. Questioning what mode a free state can be maintained in a corrupt city, he states that Rome had orders, which kept the citizens checked. He then goes into a discussion of the rulers of Rome and how a strong or weak Prince can maintain or destroy a kingdom. He continues, to say that after a weak prince a kingdom could not remain strong with another weak prince. Luckily, the first three kings each had a certain strength, which aided the city. Romulus was fierce, Numa was religious, and Tullus was dedicated to war. The book then slightly shifts focus to discussing the reformation of a state. Machiavelli explains that if one wants to change a state they must keep some elements of the previous state. Also, he says that a Prince or republic should not deny citizens necessities. He then conveys that having a dictatorial authority was beneficial for the City of Rome because a republic cannot always make the quick decisions demanded by a crisis, and in these cases one person can do a better job than the rest. Rome benefited because the office of Dictator was written into the constitution so it could be exercised legitimately and then retired during the emergency. Continuing with this, weak republics are not truly able to make important decisions and that any change will come from necessity. He also goes into a discussion about how to establish and maintain a tyrannical government, using the example of Appius Claudius, an individual who was unwise in approaching this endeavor. He states that those who are successful in establishing absolutist regimes attack the nobles by appealing to the people, then oppress the people when all of their enemies are eliminated. The themes of pride and corruption appear many times throughout The Discourses and Machiavelli believes that it is very easy for a person to be corrupted. It is also good for a soldier to have the desire to fight for personal pride and glory. Towards the end of Book I, Machiavelli adds that great accidents that occur in a city usually come with some kind of sign. This sign could be divine or seen through a revelation. He gives the particular example that in Florence right before the death of Lorenzo de' Medici the Elder, a cathedral was hit by lightning. Machiavelli explains that Livy stated that people are strong together, but weak when alone, citing the example of the Roman plebs. Livy additionally feels that the multitude is wiser than the one prince. Thus, Book I examines a variety of issues that occur when creating a state, and looks at it with specific examples from Rome and other parts of Italy. =Book II= Chapter one debates whether Virtue or Fortune had more of a cause of the empire that the Romans acquired. There were many opinions equally distributed to both sides, and there is not final consensus on which had more of a cause, virtue or fortune. Chapter two discusses what people the Romans had to combat, and that they obstinately defended their freedom. In this chapter he also goes into why he thinks that republics are better than principalities. Chapter three talks about how Rome had its rise to power through their ruining of surrounding cities, making Rome the primary power of the region. Chapter four lists the three modes of expanding that republics have taken. Also, Machiavelli gives the reasoning and background information for why these three modes of expanding that the republic took were necessary. Chapter five talks about how memories can be lost due to issues such as language barriers, floods, or even plague. Chapter six talks about how the Romans went about making war. He claims that their goal for war was to be short and massive. Chapter seven talks about how much land the Romans gave per Colonist. He claims that this would be tough to determine because it depended on the places where they sent the colonists. Chapter 8 discusses the cause why peoples leave their ancestral places and inundate the country of others. He blames it either on famine or on war that has taken over their land and they must move on to something new. Chapter 9 he talks about what factors commonly cause wars. He says there are many different reasons for disputes. Chapter 10 talks about how the common opinion of money being the sinew of war is actually incorrect. Faith and benevolence of men is what makes war what it is. Chapter 11 talks about the idea that becoming friends with a Prince who has more reputation than force is not something that would go unnoticed. People were looking for good connections, and the prince who has a better reputation is better off than the one with better force. Chapter 12 talks about whether it is better to wait to be attacked if you feel it is coming, or if you should make the first move. Chapter 13 talks about how a person comes from base to great fortune more through fraud than through force. He thinks that fraud makes it quicker and easier for a person to succeed, so force is not needed as much. Chapter 14 talks about how men confuse themselves into believing that through humility, they will conquer pride. Claims that humility and pride are two separate things and do not go hand in hand. Chapter 15 claims that the resolutions of weak states will always be ambiguous, and that slow decisions, no matter who or what is making them, are always hurtful. Chapter 16 talks about how much the soldiers of his time did not conform to the ancient orders. Values and ideologies were being lost, and soldiers just were not the same as they used to be. Chapter 17 talks about how much artillery should be esteemed by armies in the present times, and whether the opinion universally held of it is true. Many different opinions are voiced in the chapter, and each has a valid argument to go along with it. Chapter 18 talks about how the Authority of the Romans and by the example of the ancient military infantry should be esteemed more than the horse. Claimed that the military esteemed the military on foot much more than military on horseback. Chapter 19 talks about how the acquisitions by Republics that are not well ordered and that do not proceed according to Roman virtue are for their ruin, not their exaltation. Chapter talks in detail about the different outlooks people have. Chapter 20 talks about and asks what danger the prince or republic runs that avails itself of Auxiliary or mercenary military. Says that having these services admits you are weak and is not something that is necessarily respectable. Chapter 21 says the first praetor the Romans sent anyplace was to Capua, four hundred years after they began making war. Claims that the Romans were changing things and were acting differently from past precedents. Chapter 22 talks about how false the opinions of men often are in judging great things. Says that the best men are treated poorly during the quiet times because of envy or from other ambitions. Chapter 23 talks about how much the Romans, in judging subjects for some accidents that necessitated such judgment, fled from the middle way (which he criticizes) in regards to punishments. Chapter 24 claims that fortresses are generally much more harmful than useful. They did not build fortresses to protect them because they were of another virtue to that of building them. Chapter 25 says to assault a disunited city so as to seize it by means of its disunion is a contradictory policy. Chapter 26 claims vilification and abuse generate hatred against those who use them, without any utility to them. He is saying that the abuse that men do to women is something that brings hatred not only from the victim, but from everyone who hears about it as well. Chapter 27 says for prudent princes and republics, it should be enough to conquer, for most often when it is not enough, one loses. He is saying that people should be happy with what they get, because if they try to get more than they can handle, they end up losing it all. Chapter 28 says how dangerous it is for a Republic or a Prince not to avenge an injury done against the public or against a private person. Chapter 29 claims that fortune blinds the spirits of men when it does not wish them to oppose its plans. This means that fate will take its toll on what men do and do not do. Chapter 30 says that truly powerful Republics and Princes buy friendships not with money, but with virtue and reputation of strength. Chapter 31 talks about how dangerous it is to believe the banished. He is talking about how there should be no circumstances in which someone should believe another individual who has been kicked out of the country. Clearly they did wrong, and one does not need that kind of negative influence in one's life. Chapter 32 talks about how many modes the Romans seized towns. He talks about the different advantages to seizing towns in different ways, both weighing the pros and cons such as cost and efficiency. Chapter 33 talks about how the Romans gave free commissions to their captains of armies. They valued these men and what they did so much that they were willing to give free commissions in order to show them how they felt about them. =Book III= Chapter 1 of Book 3 starts with a heading: \\"If one wishes a sect or republic to live long, it is necessary to draw it back often towards its beginning.\\" Machiavelli admits that \\"all worldly things\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 209 have a natural ending. If any of these worldly things are altered and changed from its normal course, \\"it is for its safety and not to its harm.\\" Machiavelli, however, desires to talk about exceptions to this rule, \\"...mixed bodies, such as republics and sections\\". For these things, \\"alterations are for safety that lead them back toward their beginnings.\\" He is referring to the state of a republic when he ends the first paragraph, declaring that, \\"...it is a thing clearer than light that these bodies do not last if they do not renew themselves.\\" Since a republic must be led towards its beginning, \\"all the beginnings of sects, republics, and kingdoms must have some goodness in them, by means of which they must regain their reputation and their first increase.\\" If that goodness is ever corrupted, \\"unless something intervenes to lead it back to the mark, it of necessary kills that body.\\" This return toward the beginning is done either through prudence from outside of the republic or from within the republic. Machiavelli cites an example from Roman history: when the Gauls, referring to them as the French, sacked Rome in 387 BC. He believes that the Gauls' aggression was necessary, \\"if one wished that that it be reborn and, by being reborn, regain new life and new virtue, and regain the observance of religion and justice, which were beginning to be tainted in it.\\" He refers to the period before the sacking, when the Roman tribunes were given consular power and \\"they did not observe any religious ceremony.\\" Romans had lost sight of \\"the other good institutions ordered by Romulus and by other prudent princes than was reasonable and necessary to maintain their free way of life.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 210 In Machiavelli's opinion, the sacking of Rome was deserved since the Romans had lost sight of all the things their forefathers had told them to follow. Machiavelli, in fact, refers to Gaul's attack on Rome as an \\"external beating\\". The usage of that phrase puts the event in a punitive light, as if Rome is a disobedient child being beat back into shape. This event was necessary \\"so that all the orders of the city might be regained and that it might be shown to that people that it was necessary not only to maintain religion and justice but also to esteem its good citizens and to take more account of their virtue than of these advantages that it appeared to them they lacked through their works.\\" According to Machiavelli, \\"this good emerges in republics either through the virtue of a man or through the virtue of an order.\\" Later on Machiavelli states that it is not preferable to have renewal carried out by an external force as \\"it is so dangerous that it is not in any way to be desired.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 212 In the Roman Republic, \\"the orders that drew the Roman republic back toward its beginning were the tribunes of the plebs, the censors, and all the other laws that went against the ambition and the insolence of men.\\" Before the taking of Rome by the Gauls, the executions of such famous Romans as \\"the sons of Brutus\\" or \\"that of Maelius the grain dealer\\", because they were \\"excessive and notable\\" drew Romans back from any dangerous or tumultuous behavior. Machiavelli reasons that \\"Unless something arises by which punishment is brought back to their memory and fear is renewed in their spirits, soon so many delinquents join together that they can no longer be punished without danger.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 211 He relates this to his native Florence, where \\"from 1434 up to 1494\\", such things were done \\"to regain the state...otherwise, it was difficult to maintain it.\\" Machiavelli then asserts that \\"this drawing back of republics toward their beginning arises also from the simple virtue of one man, without depending on any law law that stimulates you to any execution.\\" He gives examples of particularly great Romans like Horatius Coclus and Gaius Mucius Scaevola who were \\"of such reputation and so much example that good men desire to imitate them and the wicked are ashamed to hold a life contrary to them.\\" Machiavelli venerates these Romans much like their countrymen did. Machiavelli then turns his attention toward the renewal of sects, arguing that \\"...our religion, which would be altogether eliminated if it had not been drawn back toward its beginning by Saint Francis and Saint Dominick.\\" \\"For with poverty and with the example of the life of Christ they brought back into the minds of men what had already been eliminated there.\\" Machiavelli begins Chapter 2 declaring that, \\"There was never anyone so prudent nor esteemed so wise for any eminent work of his than Junius Brutus deserves to be held in his simulation of stupidity.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 213 He is referring to the way in which Brutus removed the Tarquins from Rome \\"to live more securely and to maintain his patrimony...\\" Machiavelli believes that \\"From his example all those who are discontented with a prince have to learn: they should first measure and first weigh their forces, and if they are so powerful that they can expose themselves as his enemies and make war on him openly, they should enter on this way, as less dangerous and more honorable. But if they are such quality that their forces are not enough for making open war, they should seek with all industry to make themselves friends to him...\\" Machiavelli describes a middle path where you can enjoy the fortunes of the prince you have become familiar with, but not fall into ruin should he encounter it; one keeps his distance but also quite close. Machiavelli believes this to be impossible, however, stating that \\"one must be reduced to the two modes written above‚Äîthat is, either distance oneself from or to bind oneself to them. Whoever does otherwise, if he is a man notable for his quality, lives in continual danger.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 214 Machiavelli concludes the chapter, writing, \\"Thus one must play crazy, like Brutus, and make oneself very much mad, praising, speaking, seeing, doing things against your intent so as to please the prince.\\" The heading for Chapter 3 states \\"That it is necessary to kill the sons of Brutus if one wishes to maintain a newly acquired freedom.\\" He refers to the episode where Brutus sentenced his own sons to death when they entered into a plot to restore the Tarquin dynasty, Machiavelli writes that, \\"...after a change of state, either from republic to tyranny or from tyranny to republic, a memorable execution against the enemies of present conditions is necessary. Whoever takes up a tyranny and does not kill Brutus, and whoever makes a free state and does not kill the sons of Brutus, maintains himself for little time.\\" He compares it to an event in recent Florentine history when Piero Soderini, a Florentine statesman, was appointed gonfalonier (the highest rank in Florentine government) for life. Because of his inability to crush his enemies, Soderini would eventually go into exile. Machiavelli believes that since he did not know how to act like Brutus, and eliminate those who opposed the structure of the republic, he lost \\"not only his fatherland, but his state and his reputation.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 215 The heading of Chapter 4 is, \\"A prince does not live secure in a principality while those who have been despoiled of it are living.\\" Machiavelli begins the chapter citing Livy: \\"The death of Tarquin Priscus, caused by the sons of Ancus, and the death of Servius Tullius, caused by Tarquin the Proud, show how difficult and dangerous it is to despoil one individual of the kingdom and to leave him alive, even though on might seek to win him over by compensation.\\" This event functions as advice to future princes, \\"every prince can be warned that he never lives secure in his principality as long as those who have been despoiled of it are living.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 216 The topic of Chapter 5 is \\"What makes a king who is heir to a kingdom lose it.\\" Machiavelli starts the chapter relating the story of Tarquin the Proud (also known as Lucius Tarquinius Superbus), the last king of Rome, \\"When Tarquin the Proud had killed Servius Tullius, and there were no heirs remaining of him, he came to possess the kingdom securely, since he did not have to fear those things that had offended his predecessors. Although the mode of seizing the kingdom had been extraordinary and hateful, nonetheless, if he had observed the ancient orders of the other kings, he would have been endured and would not have excited the senate and plebs against him so as to take the state away from him.\\" Tarquin's tyranny over the people of Rome would lead to his overthrow and incredibly negative status in Roman history. From Tarquin's example can modern princes learn how to run their kingdom: \\"Thus princes may know that they begin to lose their state at the hour they begin to break the laws and those modes and those customs that are ancient, under which men have lived a long time.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 217 It is in a prince's interests to rule well for \\"when men are governed well they do not seek or wish for any other freedom.\\" Chapter 6, the longest chapter in the book, pertains to conspiracies. Machiavelli believes that the danger of conspiracy must be raised as \\"many more princes are seen to have lost their lives and states through these than by open war. For to be able to make open war on a prince is granted to few; to be able to conspire against them is granted to everyone.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 218 He cites the verdict of Cornelius Tacitus as someone everyone should fellow, as it says that \\"men have to honor past things and obey present ones; and they should desire good princes and tolerate them, however they may be made. And truly, whoever does otherwise, most often ruins himself and his fatherland.\\" Machiavelli immediately makes it clear that \\"the prince who has excited this universal hatred against himself has particular individuals who have been more offended by him and whose desire to avenge themselves.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 219 Much like how in Chapter 5, there is incentive to being a good ruler. Machiavelli writes that \\"property and honor are two things that offend men more than any other offense, from which the prince should guard himself.\\" Of honors taken away from men, women are incredibly important. He cites an example in modern Italy of when Giulio Belanti moved against Pandolfo Petrucci, tyrant of Sienna, after his daughter had been stolen to be made Pandolfo's wife. Another motivator for conspiracy is when a man feels the desire to free his fatherland from whoever has seized it. This was primarily what drove Brutus and Cassius to conspire against Caesar.trans. by Mansfield, p. 220 Machiavelli gives examples of how any man can create a conspiracy, ranging from the nobleman who assassinated King Philip of Macedon to the Spanish peasant who stabbed King Ferdinand in the neck.\\" He asserts that \\"all conspiracies are made by great men of those very familiar to the prince.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 221 Though any man can lead a conspiracy, only great men can perfectly execute it. Dangers are found in conspiracies at three times: before, in the deed, and after.trans. by Mansfield, p. 222 Machiavelli writes that when a conspiracy has been exposed, it takes a great man to surrender only himself and not his fellow conspirators. The modern examples of these kind men are few, but Machiavelli cites Livy's example of \\"the conspiracy made against Hieronymus, king of Syracuse, in which Theodorus, one of the conspirators, was taken and with great virtue concealed all the conspirators and accused the friends of the king\\".trans. by Mansfield, p. 224 Another example from Roman history Machiavelli raises is the Pisonian conspiracy against Nero. He then takes examples of conspiracy to his own time, writing of the conspiracy of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici.trans. by Mansfield, p. 228 Failure to execute a conspiracy results only from the executor's own cowardice and lack of spirit. According to Machiavelli, an example can be found in Livy's writings when \\"after Marius had been taken by the Minturnans, a slave was sent to kill him, who, frightened by the presence of that man and by the memory of his name, became cowardly and lost all force for killing him.\\" He establishes that \\"conspiracies that are made against the fatherland are less dangerous for the ones who make them than those against princes.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 232 The topic for Chapter 7 summarizes the entire entry: \\"Whence it arises that changes from freedom to servitude and from servitude to freedom are some of them without blood, some of them full of it.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 236 Machiavelli cites the bloodless expulsion of the Tarquins from Ancient Rome and from his own period, the expulsion of the Medici family in 1494, as examples of such nonviolent changes. The heading of Chapter 8 is, \\"Whoever wishes to alter a republic should consider its subject.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 237 Machiavelli begins Chapter 8 stating that \\"...a wicked citizen cannot work for ill in a republic that is not corrupt.\\" He cites the example of the Romans Spurius Cassius and Manlius Capitolinus. Spurius's hopes to win over the Plebs with gifts were dashed when they refused him, knowing that it would cost them their freedom. If the Plebs had been wicked, they would have accepted Spurius's tyranny. Camillus was another man who misunderstood the Roman people. Machiavelli concludes that \\"Two things are to be considered here: one, that one has to seek glory in a corrupt city by modes other than in one that still lives politically; the other (which is almost the same as the first), that men in their proceedings‚Äîand so much the more in great actions‚Äîshould consider the times and accommodate themselves to them.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 238 Chapter 9 concerns \\"How one must vary with the times if one wishes always to have good fortune.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 239 Machiavelli writes, \\"I have often considered that the cause of the bad and of the good fortune of men is the matching of the mode of one's proceeding with the times.\\" He continues, saying that \\"...he comes to err less and to have prosperous fortune who matches the time with his mode...and always proceeds as nature forces you.\\" Machiavelli gives the example of Quintus Fabius Maximus, who was able to turn the tides of the Punic Wars \\"with his slowness and caution.\\" His behavior matched the state of the Roman republic and its army at the time. He raises the example of Piero Soderini again, who \\"proceeded in all his affairs with humanity and patience. He and his fatherland prospered while the times were comfortable to the mode of proceeding; but as times came later when he needed to break with patience and humility, he did not know how to do it, so that he together with his fatherland were ruined.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 240 Chapter 10 pertains to the fact that \\"a captain cannot flee battle when the adversary wishes him to engage in it in any mode.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 241 Machiavelli refers to those princes or republics who send out others to represent them in war as \\"effeminate.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 242 He believes that these republics and princes are following the footsteps of Fabius Maximus, \\"who in deferring combat saved the state for the Romans.\\" They misinterpret this great Roman's deed, however, as according to Machiavelli, it \\"is nothing other than to say:'Do battle to the enemy's purpose and not yours.'\\" If one hides in his city, far from the field of battle, he \\"leaves one's country as prey to the enemy.\\" If one hides within the city with his army, they will be besieged, starved, and forced to surrender. Machiavelli's next point is that \\"one ought to wish to acquire glory even when losing; and one has more glory in being conquered by force than through another inconvenience that has made you lose.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 244 Machiavelli begins Chapter 11 explaining the considerable power to the tribunes of the plebs: \\"The power of the tribunes of the plebs in the city of Rome was great, and it was necessary, as had been discoursed of by us many times, because otherwise one would not have been able to place a check on the ambition of the nobility, which would have corrupted that republic a long time before it did corrupt itself.\\" The Tribunes worked together with many other Romans to overthrow those who sought to corrupt the Republic. Machiavelli concludes from the Roman example that \\"...whenever there are many powers united against another power, even though all together are much more powerful, nonetheless, one ought always to put more hope in that one alone, who is less mighty, than in the many, even though very mighty.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 245 Machiavelli desires to talk about modern examples, however; he brings up when, in 1483, all the Italian states declared war on Venice. When they could no longer field an army, they corrupted the duke of Milan and were able to regain any towns they had lost and part of the state of Ferrara. The heading for Chapter 12 states, \\"That a prudent captain ought to impose every necessity to engage in combat on his soldiers and take it away from those of enemies.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 246 According to Machiavelli, this is an important duty for the captain of any army. In the second paragraph, Machiavelli states, \\"when he assaults a town, a captain ought to contrive with all diligence to lift such necessity from its defenders, and in consequence such obstinacy‚Äîif they have fear of punishment, he promises pardon, and if they had fear for their freedom. he shows he does not go against the common good but against the ambitious few in the city, which has many times made campaigns and captures of towns easier.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 247 From Livy's writing, Machiavelli cites an example when Camillus, already inside of the city of the Veientes with his army, commanded, loud enough for the inhabitants to hear him, that no one should hurt those who are unarmed.trans. by Mansfield, p. 249 Chapter 13 begins with a question: \\"Which is more to be trusted, a good captain who has a weak army or a good army that has a weak captain.\\" Machiavelli's raises the story of Coriolanus, a Roman exile who transformed the conquered Volusci into a functional fighting force. There have also been moments in Roman history when an army has performed better after the deaths of their consuls. At the end of the chapter, Machiavelli asserts that \\"a captain who has time to instruct men and occasion to arm them is very much more to be trusted than an insolent army with a head made tumultuously by it.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 250 Chapter 14 concerns \\"What effects new inventions that appear in the middle of the fight and new voices that are heard may produce.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 251 Machiavelli cites the example of Quintius, who \\"seeing one of the wings of his army bending, began to cry out loudly that it should stand steady because the other wing of the army was victorious, and‚Äîthis word having given spirit to his men and terrified the enemy‚Äîhe won.\\" This chapter concerns sudden events that may happen in the midst of heated battle. According to Machiavelli, \\"...a good captain among his other orders ought to order whoever are those who have to pick up his voice and relay it to others, and accustom his soldiers not to believe any but them and his captains not say anything but what has been commissioned by him.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 252 Such actions would control the morale of the army. Chapter 15's topic is \\"That one individual and not many should be put over an army; and that several commanders hurt.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 253 Machiavelli references an incident in Roman history when the Romans created four tribunes with consular power to control the colony of Fidenae. \\"They left one of them for the guarding of Rome and sent three against the Fidantes and the Veientes. Because they were divided among themselves and disunited, they brought back dishonor and not harm.\\" Chapter 16 pertains to \\"That in difficult times one goes to find true; and in easy times not virtuous men but those with riches or kinship have more favour.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 254 Machiavelli writes that \\"It has always been, and will always be, that great and rare men are neglected in a republic in peaceful times.\\" He continues with this point, referencing Nicias of Athens: \\"For while Athens was at peace, he knew that there were infinite citizens who wished to go ahead of him; but if war was made, he knew that no citizen would be superior or equal to him.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 255 Nicias was against the Athenian invasion of Sicily during the Peloponnesian War since he believed Athens was already on the verge of victory; the spectacular failure of the invasion changed the tide of the war. He relates this belief to a moment in Florentine history; when, in 1494, \\"the city came upon one individual who showed how armies have to be commanded, who was Antonio Giacomini. While dangerous wars had to be made, all the ambition of the other citizens ceased, and in the choice of commissioner and head of the armies he had no competitor...\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 256 At the beginning of Chapter 17, Machiavelli asserts that \\"A republic ought to consider very much not putting someone over any important administration to whom any notable injury had been done by another.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 257 He brings up the consul Claudius Nero, who \\"throughout the city he was spoken of indecently, not without great dishonor and indignation for him.\\" The heading for Chapter 19 declares that \\"Nothing is more worthy of a captain than to foretell the policies of the enemy.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 258 Close to the end of the Roman civil war between Brutus and Cassius and Marc Antony and Octavian, Brutus won the battle on his wing but Cassius believed that Brutus had actually lost. Thinking the battle to be all but over, Cassius killed himself. Machiavelli relates the point of Chapter 19 to a moment in modern history; when, in 1498, Florence went to war with Venice and was able to predict the enemy army's movements and win the war.trans. by Mansfield, p. 260 In Chapter 19, Machiavelli states that \\"it appears in governing a multitude, it is better to be humane rather than proud, merciful rather than cruel.\\" Chapter 20 concerns the story of Camillus when he was besieging the city of the Falsci. A schoolmaster of the noblest children of the city ventured out and offered the children to the Roman camp. Camillus refused the offer, and after binding the hands of the schoolmaster, gave rods to each of the children and escorted them back into the city while they beat him. When the Falsci heard of Camillus's good act, they willfully surrendered the city without putting up a fight. Machiavelli concludes from the story that \\"Here it is to be considered with this true example how much more a humane act full of charity is sometimes able to do in the spirits of men than a ferocious and violent act...\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 261 Chapter 21 is titled \\"Whence it arises that with a different mode of proceeding Hannibal produced those same effects in Italy as Scipio did in Spain.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 262 When the Roman Scipio Africanus entered Spain, his humanity and mercy immediately made the entire province friendly to him. In a similar manner, when Hannibal marched through Italy, many cities rebelled and followed him.trans. by Mansfield, p. 263 Machiavelli believes such things occurred because \\"men are desirous of new things, so much that most often those who are well off desire newness as much as those who are badly off...this desire makes the doors open to everyone who makes himself head of an innovation in a province.\\" Eventually both leaders were rejected by the people who had once accepted them in these provinces. Chapter 22 is titled \\"That the hardness of Manlius Torquatus and the kindness of Valerius Corvinus acquired for each the same glory.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 264 Machiavelli begins the chapter relating the story of \\"two excellent captains in Rome at one and the same time, Manlius Torquatus and Valerius Corvinus. They lived in Rome with like virtue, with like triumphs and glory, and each of them, in what pertained to the enemy, acquired it with like virtue; but in what belonged to the armies and to their dealings with the soldiers, they proceeded very diversely. For Manlius commanded his soldiers with every kind of severity...Valerius, on the other hand, dealt with them with every humane mode and means and full of a familiar domesticity.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 265 As one can assume from the title, two very different men achieved very similar glory. Later on, Machiavelli asserts that \\"to command strong things one must be strong; and he who is of this strength and who commands them cannot then make them observed with mildness. But whoever is not of this strength of spirit ought to guard himself from extraordinary commands and can use his humanity in ordinary ones...\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 266 He concludes the chapter stating that the behavior of Manlius and Valerius fit specific needs: \\"the proceedings of Valerius is useful in a prince and pernicious in a citizen, not only to the fatherland but to himself: to it, because those modes prepare the way for tyranny; to himself, because in suspecting his mode of proceeding, his city is constrained to secure itself against him to his harm. So by the contrary I affirm that the proceeding of Manlius is harmful in a prince and useful in a citizen, and especially to the fatherland...\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 268 Chapter 23 concerns \\"For what cause Camillus was expelled from Rome.\\" According to Machiavelli, \\"Titus Livy brings up these causes of the hatred: first, that he applied to the public the money that was drawn from the goods of the Veientes that were sold and did not divide it as booty; another, that in the triumph, he had his triumphal chariot pulled by four white horses, from which they said that because of his pride he wished to be equal to the sun; third, that he made a vow to Apollo the tenth part of the booty of the Veientes...\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 269 When the people were denied their part of the loot, they rebelled against Camillus. Referring to the Roman Republic, Machiavelli begins Chapter 24 establishing that \\"...two things were the cause of the dissolution of that republic: one was the contentions that arose from Agrarian law; the other, the prolongation of commands. If these things had been known well from the beginning, and proper remedies produced for them, a free way of life would have been longer and perhaps quieter.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 270 If one was to decipher Machiavelli's statement into modern terms, he believes that bureaucracy and inefficiency resulted in the demise of the Roman Republic. In Chapter 25. Machiavelli states that \\"the most useful thing that may be ordered in a free way of life is that the citizens be kept poor.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 271 He recalls the story of the great Cincinnatus, who, when the Rome was in grave danger, was made dictator by the Senate and saved the Republic. When the battle was over, he surrendered his power and returned to his small villa. His humbleness or \\"poverty\\" became something future Romans tried to emulate.trans. by Mansfield, p. 272 Machiavelli concludes the chapter writing, \\"One could show with a long speech how much better fruits poverty produced than riches, and how the one has honored cities, provinces, sects, and the other has ruined them...\\" Chapter 26's title is \\"How a State is ruined because of women.\\" He summarizes his own thoughts close to the end of the chapter: \\"In this text are several things to be noted. First, one sees that women have been causes of much ruin, and have done great harm to those who govern a city, and have caused many divisions in them.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 273 He raises the example of Lucretia, whose rape by Tarquin the Proud's son ultimately led the exile of the Tarquin family from Rome and destruction of the Roman monarchy. Chapter 27 concerns \\"How one has to unite a divided city; and how that opinion is not true that to hold cities one needs to hold them divided.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 274 Referring to when the Romans handled tumult the leaders of a divided city they had recently conquered (Ardea), Machiavelli believes that there are three possible ways to handle the leaders of rebellion within a held city: \\"...either to kill them, as they did; or to remove them from the city; or to make them make peace together under obligations not to offend one another.\\" Machiavelli relates this belief to when, in his own times, Florence conquered the city of Pistoia. The Florentine rulers tried all 3 methods when handling the feuding houses of the city.trans. by Mansfield, p. 275 He establishes that it is impossible to rule a divided city. The heading for Chapter 28 states that \\"One should be mindful of the works of citizens because many times underneath a merciful work a beginning of tyranny is concealed.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 276 Machiavelli relates it to a moment in Roman history when there was considerable famine and the wealthy man Spurius Maelius planned to distribute grain to win over the favour of the Plebs. Maelius planned to become dictator with this favor but was executed by the senate before he could do so. Chapter 29's topic is \\"That the sins of peoples arise from princes.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 277 Machiavelli establishes that \\"Princes should not complain of any sin that the people whom they have to govern commit, for it must be that such sins arise either by negligence or by his being stained with like errors.\\" A king should not punish his citizens for pillaging in war when he is himself a known pillager. Machiavelli relates this belief held by Roman rulers to a quote from Lorenzo de' Medici: \\"And that which the lord does, many do later; For all eyes are turned to the lord.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 278 Chapter 30 pertains to how envy must be eliminated if a man wants to do good work in the republic, and that if one sees the enemy, he must order the defense of his city. In Rome's early history, envy between great Romans led to a dysfunction in the army and failures in war.trans. by Mansfield, p. 279 Referring to envy, Machiavelli believes that \\"in many times that the cause that men cannot work well, since the said envy does not permit them to have the authority that is necessary to have in things of importance.\\" Machiavelli does think this envy can be eliminated when \\"either through some strong and difficult accident in which each, seeing himself perishing, puts aside every ambition and runs voluntarily to obey him\\" or \\"...when, either by violence or by natural order, those who have been your competitors in coming to some reputation and to some greatness die.\\" The heading for Chapter 31 states \\"Strong republics and excellent men retain the same spirit and their same dignity in every fortune.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 281 If the leader of a republic is weak, then his republic will be weak. Machiavelli raises the modern example of the Venetians, whose good fortune created a sort of \\"insolence\\" that they failed to respect the powerful states around them and lost much of their territorial holdings.trans. by Mansfield, p. 282 Machiavelli asserts that is necessary to have a strong military in order to have a state with \\"good laws or any other good thing .\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 283 Chapter 32 concerns \\"what modes some have held to for disturbing a peace.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 284 Machiavelli cites several examples from the Punic Wars.trans. by Mansfield, pp. 284‚Äì85 The heading for Chapter 33 asserts that \\"If one wishes to win a battle, it is necessary to make the army confident both among themselves and in the captain.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 285 Machiavelli lists out the methods to do so: \\"...that it be armed and ordered well, that [its members] know one another. Nor this confidence arise except in soldiers who have been born and lived together. The captain must esteemed of a quality that they trust in his prudence.\\" Once an army trusts, they win. Chapter 34 pertains to \\"What fame or word or opinion makes the people being to favor a citizen; and whether it distributes the magistracies with great prudence than a prince.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 287 Machiavelli brings up the example of Titus Manlius who, upon rescuing his father, the \\"filial piety\\" displayed inspired the people and led to Titus Manlius being put in second command of the tribunes of the legions. Chapter 35 concerns \\"What dangers are borne in making oneself head in counseling a thing; and the more it has of the extraordinary, the greater are the dangers incurred in it.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 290 Machiavelli writes that \\"since men judging things by the end, all the ill that results from it is attributed to the author of the counsel; and if good results from it, he is commended for it, but the reward by far does not counterbalance the harm.\\" He brings up the present story of the Sultan Selim who, after receiving faulty military advice and losing a great part of his army, killed the men who gave him this advice. In Chapter 36, Machiavelli tackles \\"The causes why the French have been are still judged in fights at the beginning as more than men and later as less than women.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 292 Machiavelli believes that this stereotype first arose in Livy's writings; when the Romans did battle with the Gauls. The Gauls were quick to start fights but in actual combat failed spectacularly. He writes that while the Roman army had fury and virtue, the army of the Gauls only had fury, which, more often than not, lead them into embarrassing battles.trans. by Mansfield, p. 293 In Chapter 37, Machiavelli wonders \\"Whether small battles are necessary before the main battle; and if one wishes to avoid them, what one ought to do to know a new enemy.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 294 Pondering this question, Machiavelli writes, \\"For I consider, on one side, that a good captain ought altogether to avoid working for anything that is of small moment and can produce bad effects on his army: for to begin a fight in which all one's force are not at work and all one's fortune is risked is a thing altogether rash...On the other side, I consider that when wise captains come up against a new enemy who is reputed, before they come to the main battle they are necessitated to make trial of such enemies with light fight for their soldiers...\\" In Chapter 38, Machiavelli writes of \\"How a captain in whom his army can have confidence ought to be made.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 296 In a captain demanding of his troop to follow his deeds, not his words, there seems to be great success.trans. by Mansfield, p. 297 The topic of Chapter 39 is \\"That a captain ought to be a knower of sites.\\" It is necessary for a captain to have knowledge of other countries. In Chapter 40, Machiavelli states, \\"Although the use of fraud in every action is detestable, nonetheless in managing war it is a praiseworthy and glorious thing, and he who overcomes the enemy with fraud is praised as much as the one who overcomes it with force.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 299 Fraud in war means fooling the enemy.trans. by Mansfield, p. 300 He raises the story of Pontus, captain of the Samnites, who sent some of his soldiers in shepherds clothing to the Roman camp so that they could be lead them into an ambush where Pontus's army was waiting. Chapter 41 establishes \\"That the fatherland ought to be defended, whether with ignominy or with glory; and it is well defended in any mode whatever.\\" Chapter 42 is quite short and can be summarized in its heading: \\"That promises made through force ought not to be observed.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 301 Chapter 43 pertains to the fact that \\"Men who are born in one province observe almost the same nature for all times.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 302 The nature of things in the present is not much different than it was in Livy's time. According to Machiavelli, \\"Whoever reads of things past in our city of Florence and considers also those that have occurred in the nearest times will find German and French people full of avarice, pride, ferocity, and faithlessness, for all those four things have much offended our city in diverse times.\\" The point of Chapter 44 can be summarized in its heading: \\"One often obtains with impetuosity and audacity what one would never have obtained through ordinary modes.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 304 There is great reward to being ambitious in key moments like a battle. In Chapter 45, Machiavelli wonders, \\"What the better policy is in battles, to resist the thrust of enemies and, having resisted it, to charge them; or indeed to assault them with fury from the first.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 305 he raises the story of Decius and Fabius, two Roman consuls at war with the Samnites and Etruscans. They attacked the enemy in two entirely different manners, one slow and defensive, the other exhausting his army in a furious manner. Chapter 46 concerns that \\"not only does one city have certain modes and institutions diverse from another, and procreates men either harder or more effeminate, but in the same city one sees such a difference to exist from one family to another.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 306 Machiavelli believes not to be the result of bloodline, but education. Chapter 47 is incredibly short and can be summarized in its heading: \\"That a good citizen ought to forget private injuries for love of his fatherland.\\"trans. by Mansfield, p. 307 In Chapter 48, Machiavelli believes that \\"when one sees a great error made by an enemy, one ought to believe that there is deception underneath.\\" He cites examples from both his town time, such as when Florence went to war with Pisa in 1508, and when Rome was at war with the Etruscans.trans. by Mansfield, p. 308 The final chapter of Book 3 concerns the fact that \\"A republic has need of new acts of foresight every day if one wishes to maintain it free; and for what merits Quintus Fabius was called Maximus.\\" Quintus Fabius was a Roman censor who took all the young Romans who failed to understand the basics of the Republic and \\"derived under four tribes, so that by being shut in such small spaces they could not corrupt all Rome.trans. by Mansfield, p. 310 Due to the expediency of this fix, and the fact that it was well received by the people of Rome, he gained the name \\"Maximus\\". Reception and reaction Francesco Guicciardini, Machiavelli's close friend and critic, read the book and wrote critical notes (Considerazioni) on many of the chapters. He also objected to much of Machiavelli's advice, as he thought that many of his recommendations were too vicious, stating that: > Violent remedies, though they make one safe from one aspect, yet from > another ... involve all kinds of weaknesses. Hence the prince must take > courage to use these extraordinary means when necessary, and should yet take > care not to miss any chance which offers of establishing his cause with > humanity, kindness, and rewards, not taking as an absolute rule what > Machiavelli says, who was always extremely partial to extraordinary and > violent methods. Jean-Jacques Rousseau considered the Discourses (as well as the Florentine Histories) to be more representative of Machiavelli's true philosophy: ReferencesSources=  Further reading * . * . * . * . * .

The trade involves a number of countries with the Australian live export industry being one of the largest exporters in the global trade. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, exports of live sheep rose 21.4% and live calves increased 9.7% between March 2017 and March 2018. During 2017 alone, Australia exported 2.85 million living animals in shipping containers and airplanes. The expansion of the trade has been supported by the introduction of purpose-built ships which carry large numbers of animals. The amount of livestock exported from the European Union grew to nearly 586m kilograms between 2014 and 2017, a 62.5% increase during the time period. There has been strong criticism of the industry on animal rights grounds. New Zealand has effectively phased out live exports for slaughter purposes since 2007 due to concerns about animals. __TOC__ European Union legislation The EU introduced new legislation in 2004, which was planned to come into force in 2007. Agriculture Ministers from individual states who make up the Council however, have deferred decisions on a package of reforms, including journey times, until 2011. They have adopted some reforms that offer more training and certification for drivers by 2009.Compassion in World Farming - The Campaign in Europe The legislation was also written with the aim of covering better loading and unloading facilities. United Kingdom Between 15 July 2002 and January 2004, around 200,000 lambs and sheep were exported for slaughter or further fattening abroad, mainly to France and Italy.CIWF Report 2000 The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) is responsible for conducting inspections of animals at the point of loading and at ports. Trading Standards also has powers to inspect animals during transport, and is responsible for carrying out any prosecutions under the regulations. The Port of Ramsgate temporarily halted live transport after an incident in 2012, when 40 sheep were euthanised after being badly injured during transit. The decision was overturned by the High Court on the grounds that the port could not ban live animal exports on the grounds of freedom of movement with the EU and UK legislation. After his appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove indicated in July 2017 that Brexit would offer the opportunity to ban live animal export for slaughter.Live Animal Exports within the European Union 4 Jul 2017 Australia Australia is one of the world's largest exporters of sheep and cattle. According to Meat and Livestock Australia, 2.44 million sheep were exported to markets in Asia and the Middle East in 2012,MLA sheep industry projections - live sheep exports reduced from 4.2 million in 2008.LiveCorp - Sheep Statistics The total number of cattle exported in 2012 was 617, 301, down 11% from the previous year. Indonesia accounted for 45% of total live cattle exports from Australia in 2012. Total cattle exports to Indonesia reduced by 33% from 2011.Meat and Livestock Australia - Live Exports The reduction in cattle exports to Indonesia in 2012 was partly due to the newly imposed ESCAS (Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme) from 2011, and partly due to Indonesia's move to become self-sufficient in beef productionThe Australian \\"Jakarta fires new shots in cattle war\\" 20 September 2012 Most of the livestock are for human consumption but there is also an active trade in breeding stock, including dairy cattle. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources controls the Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock. The standards were amended in April 2011 (version 2.3).Australian Standards for the Export of Livestock (Version 2.3) April 2011 The Department also introduced ESCAS (Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme), in 2011 -- a system requiring exporters to provide evidence of compliance with internationally agreed animal welfare standards, and to demonstrate traceability and control through the supply chain. According to the Department, ESCAS was developed in response to evidence of cruelty to Australian cattle in Indonesia, and then extended to all livestock exports for the purpose of slaughter. See Animal Welfare section. AQIS (Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service) manages quarantine controls to minimise the risk of exotic pests and diseases entering the country. AQIS also provides import and export inspection and certification to help retain Australia's highly favourable animal, plant and human health status and wide access to overseas export markets. Other key markets include Israel, Malaysia, Japan, Mexico and China.MLA markets for Australian live exports The major markets for Australian sheep are Kuwait and Jordan. Other key markets are Bahrain, the UAE, Oman and Qatar. Australia's main market competitors are from China, South America and North Africa. New Zealand In 2005, New Zealand exported NZ$217 million worth of live animals, mainly for breeding purposes. Exports included cattle, sheep, horses, deer, goats and day-old chicks. Because New Zealand is free from most exotic diseases most livestock shipments are for breeding or finishing purposes. Cattle are not exported for slaughter and the last export of sheep for slaughter was in 2003. In November 2007, the New Zealand Government introduced the new Customs Exports Prohibition (Livestock for Slaughter) Order. Although not a blanket ban, the new legal requirement restricts live animal exports for slaughter unless the risks to animals and New Zealand's trade reputation can be adequately managed. There has been no export of livestock for slaughter purposes since that date. New Zealand does still export live finfish and shellfish. In September 2020, the New Zealand Government suspended live cattle exports after the Gulf Livestock 1 transport ship capsized with 43 crew members and nearly 6,000 cattle on board. The ship was carrying cattle for breeding from the country to China.

Guess (styled as GUESS or Guess?) is an American clothing brand and retailer. In addition to clothing for both men and women, Guess markets other fashion accessories such as watches, jewelry, perfumes, bags and shoes. History Guess began in 1981 as a book of styles by Georges Marciano. Maurice, Georges' brother, was first sought by Georges to help with product development. Armand and Paul, also Georges' brothers, were in charge of distribution and advertising, respectively. Armand ran distribution. and Paul created the advertising, all of it in-house. Georges designed the clothes, burnishing Guess' signature style: stonewashed denim, lighter in color, softer and more form-fitting than the competitors.Article in \\"apparelnews.net\\" 2 July 2014 accessed 7 February 2017Article in \\"fashionista.com\\" 5 April 2011 accessed 7 February 2017 Georges had wanted to sell Guess products in only the more exclusive stores, such as Bloomingdales; while the other brothers decided they wanted a broader distribution strategy, which included discount stores. Georges continued to oppose the idea of marketing Guess products beyond luxury retail outlets, and different alliances formed within the company. Georges abruptly sold his stake in the company to his brothers in September, 1993 for $214.2 million. To finance the purchase, the remaining three brothers had to borrow $210 million, and $105 million was still outstanding three years later. To raise money, the brothers decided to take Guess public.Article in Los Angeles Times 14 July 2015 accessed 7 February 2017 Brother Armand quietly left the company later, after a medical leave. In 2015, Maurice retired from the company, leaving Paul as the only remaining brother on Guess‚Äô board.Article in Reuters 14 July 2015 accessed 7 February 2017 When Georges Marciano and his brothers were much younger, they opened a series of stores in France under the name MGA before launching Guess in America in 1981, after Georges Marciano first came to America in 1977. Their top seller: unisex jeans. Georges Marciano and his brothers moved to Los Angeles to see if they could pull off a similar feat, borrowing a mottled wash Georges had noticed on jeans in an Italian laundromat he had taken note of (at the time, jeans styles were only sold in indigo blue or bleached). The founder, Georges Marciano, and his brothers moved to Los Angeles in 1981 and opened the first store in upscale Beverly Hills area. Armand and Paul joined Georges and his brother in California. Georges came up with the company name after driving past a McDonald's billboard asking drivers to \\"guess\\" which eatery had the biggest cheeseburger. Maurice Marciano said, \\"Georges came home and said, 'I think I found our name. Guess.' \\" Maurice Marciano tossed up ideas until he got exasperated, and finally his brother, Georges, clarified himself. The Guess name was born. Guess, with its red triangle patch, stonewashed denim and signature zipper sliding up each ankle, was officially launched in late 1981. In just one year, sales through Bloomingdale's and Guess's Beverly Hills store hit $6 million. Guess soon began advertising, and in 1985, introduced some black-and-white ads. The ads have won numerous Clio Awards. Their fashion models have included a number of supermodels, many of whom, such as Claudia Schiffer, Anna Nicole Smith, Eva Herzigova, Valeria Mazza, Kate Upton, Julia Lescova, and Laetitia Casta,Meet New Guess Girl Alyssa Miller!. Teen Vogue. first achieved prominence via these ad campaigns. In the 1985 Robert Zemeckis movie, Back to the Future, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) wore distinctive Guess denim clothing, which was reportedly designed specifically for the film. During the 1980s, Guess was one of the most popular brands of denim jeans. The company was one of the first companies to create designer jeans. While the first jeans were for women, a men's line debuted in 1983. In 1984, Guess introduced its new line of watches known as \\"Guess\\", \\"Guess Steel\\", and the \\"Guess Collection\\". The watch line is still in existence today (although under different product lines) and has been joined by a number of other accessory sidelines. In 1984, they also introduced a line of baby's clothes, called \\"Baby Guess\\". The line is now incorporated with clothing for toddlers and kids called GUESS kids. Guess Home brand Guess store in the Philippines Guess sneaker animation Guess in Toronto In the 1990s, Milica, Aleksia and Milos had a division called Guess Home, which featured youthful, upscale bedding collections (Guess was the first company to package each sheet, duvet and pillowcase pair in packaging actually made from sheeting material, to showcase what the pattern really looked like) as well as a number of towel collections. By the end of the decade, sales dropped and Guess discontinued their home division. =Improved sales= In the 2000s, the controversy that surrounded the company during the 21st (see below) was largely forgotten. Recently, the clothing and accessories company has redesigned itself, offering several new aspects. Guess store in Philadelphia - Pennsylvania =Today= Photo of former site of the Guess store on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago Guess showroom in New York City On January 26, 2001, Guess Inc. restated previous results for fiscal 2000 after deciding to write down impaired inventory. In 2004, Guess celebrated the 20th anniversary of its watch collection, issuing a special-edition Guess watch. The accessories department was also greatly expanded and several stores across the United States were redesigned. Guess also created a lower priced collection sold exclusively through its outlet locations. Guess also introduced its first brand extension, the up-scale female line of clothing and accessories, named Marciano. In 2005, Guess began marketing perfume. The company introduced Guess for Women in the spring of 2005. Guess introduced the Guess for Men line in the spring of 2006. Guess has also continued its Guess Kids clothing line into the 2000s, and in 2006, Guess began promoting the clothing line for girls and boys through its factory retail stores. Guess continued to be guided by the Marciano brothers, as co-chairmen and co-CEOs. Maurice Marciano has overseen the design and its sales growth, while Paul managed the image and advertising. The company operates in many countries around the world with the majority of their stores located in the United States and Canada. Guess has licensees and distributors in South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, Latin America, and the Middle East. In 2012, 23 years after first posing for the brand, supermodel Claudia Schiffer posed again for Guess' black-and-white ads marking the brand's 30th anniversary. In 2015 it was announced that founder Paul Marciano will be stepping down from his position as CEO with Victor Herrero as his carefully selected replacement, in August of that same year. As of 2017, ex Fifth Harmony member and \\"Havana\\" singer Camila Cabello was announced as the new face of Guess. As of 2018, Jennifer Lopez is the new face of Guess. In 2019 it was announced that Victor Herrero will be stepping down from his position as CEO with Carlos Alberini selected as his replacement, in February 2019. ControversySweatshop allegations= During the 1980s, the company's image was damaged when allegations of sweatshop labor use surfaced throughout a few brands, and Guess was quickly marked as a major offender. In 1992, Guess contractors faced litigation from the US Department of Labor (DOL) due to failure to pay their employees the minimum wage or adequate overtime. Rather than face a court case, $573,000 in back wages were paid to employees. Soon afterward, Guess promised to monitor their contractors for illegal activity, and the company earned a place on the US DOL's 'Trendsetters List', but this position was suspended several years later in 1996 after independent inspectors found violations of regulations at seven of the company's contractors. In that same year, the company was sued by the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE), again due to the failure to pay the minimum wage or overtime to workers. The settlement, supervised by the US Department of Labor, saw the reinstatement of 8 workers found to have been illegally fired and another $80,000 in back pay given to workers. Almost immediately after the settlement, Guess announced that it was moving its sewing production to Mexico. The company denied that the move was related to these court cases, but its public image continued to suffer. Throughout the 1990s, UNITE continued a public relations campaign against Guess, focusing on the experiences of former employees. Billboards subsequently appeared in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York City featuring a photograph of Rage Against the Machine with the caption \\"Rage Against Sweatshops: We Don't Wear Guess ‚Äì A Message from Rage Against The Machine and UNITE. Injustice. Don't buy it.\\" Eventually, Guess countered with a defamation suit against Unite and several of its officials, while in 1997 the company ran full-page ads in many major American newspapers claiming that its contractors were \\"guaranteed 100% free of sweatshop labour\\". The wording of these ads was changed after federal authorities complained that the claims had not been made by anyone in the government and had no official status. Guess especially began expanding in the less competitive and increasingly lucrative European and Japanese markets. =\\"Ski Colombia: Always Plenty of Fresh Powder\\" T-shirts= In 2005, Guess pulled a line of T-shirts from the market after Erika Becker- Medina, a D.C. area resident and government employee, spearheaded a campaign calling for the boycott of the company. \\"Ski Colombia: Always Plenty of Fresh Powder\\" was embossed on the T-shirts which were released by the company in the second quarter of 2005, apparently in reference to Colombia's drug-trafficking problem. Guess distributed letters of apology. = Gucci logo infringement = In 2009, Italian luxury brand Gucci accused Guess of counterfeiting and trademark infringing the Gucci logo and the interlocking G's which appear on pairs of Guess shoes. In 2012 Gucci got $4.7 million for the damages; originally, the Italian brand wanted $221 million.

His surname translates as \\"Circassian\\". In 1702, Prince Cherkassky held a post of senior stolnik (tsar's personal assistant) and was soon assigned to assist his father, Prince Mikhail Yakovlevich Cherkassky, who had been a voivod in Tobolsk at that time.

In 1719, Peter the Great sent Aleksey to Siberia as governor. In 1726, he became a senator. During the election of Anna Ivanovna for the Russian throne in 1730, Cherkassky, the richest man in Russia in terms of the amount of serfs he owned at that time, was in charge of the gentry party, which had been in opposition to the verkhovniki (members of the Supreme Privy Council). For his services to the Crown he was appointed one of the three cabinet ministers and was promoted to the rank of grand chancellor in 1740. As a cabinet minister, Tcherkassky signed a trade agreement with Great Britain in 1734. In his post as chancellor, he signed a treaty with Prussia in 1740 and Great Britain in 1741.

Both tribes were traditional enemies of the Crow. After scouting the encampment on the banks of the Little Big Horn River, they reported to Custer. After Custer got angry at his changing into traditional Crow clothing for the battle believing he was going to die, Hairy Moccasin was dismissed by Custer about an hour before the last stand. He joined Strikes the Bear (an Arikara Scout), White Man Runs Him, and Goes Ahead with Major Marcus Reno's column on the ridge overlooking the last stand. Attacked but not overrun, most of Reno's men survived the engagement. After the Black Hills War ended, Hairy Moccasin settled onto the Crow Reservation in Montana.

It lies in the lap of Trishul massif. Located in the Himalayas, the area around the lake is uninhabited and is roughly at an altitude of , surrounded by rock-strewn glaciers and snow- clad mountains. Roopkund is a popular trekking destination. With a depth of about 3 metres, Roopkund is widely known for the hundreds of ancient human skeletons found at the edge of the lake. The human skeletal remains are visible at its bottom when the snow melts. Research generally points to a semi-legendary event where a group of people was killed in a sudden, violent hailstorm in the 9th century. Because of the human remains, the lake has been called Skeleton Lake in recent times. Human skeletons Human skeletons in Roopkund Lake Skeletons were rediscovered in 1942 by Nanda Devi game reserve ranger Hari Kishan Madhwal, although there are reports about these bones from the late 9th century. At first, British authorities feared that the skeletons represented casualties of a hidden Japanese invasion force, but it was found that the skeletons were far too old to be Japanese soldiers. The skeletons are visible in the clear water of the shallow lake during one month when the ice melts. Along with the skeletons, wooden artifacts, iron spearheads, leather slippers, and rings were also found. When a team from National Geographic retrieved about 30 skeletons in 2003, flesh was still attached to some of them. = Identification = Local legend says that the King of Kanauj, Raja Jasdhaval, with his pregnant wife, Rani Balampa, their servants, a dance troupe and others went on a pilgrimage to Nanda Devi shrine, and the group faced a storm with large hailstones, from which the entire party perished near Roopkund Lake. Remnants belonging to more than 300 people have been found. The Anthropological Survey of India conducted a study of the skeletons during the 1950s and some samples are displayed at the Anthropological Survey of India Museum, Dehradun. The studies of the skeletons revealed head injuries, which according to some sources were caused by round objects from above and the common cause of death. Those researchers concluded that the victims had been caught in a sudden hailstorm, just as described in local legends and songs. Others, however, question this theory and the source of the injuries. Radiocarbon dating of the bones at Oxford University's Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit determined the time of death to be 850 CE ¬±30 years. More recently, radiocarbon dating combined with genome-analysis found that the remains are from very different eras and belong to different distinct groups. A group of remains with South Asian ancestry was dated over a period of time around 800 CE, while the other skeletal remains of Mediterranean or Southeast Asian origin were dated to around 1800 CE. Those findings counter the theory that the individuals died in a single catastrophic event. The radiocarbon dating further suggests that the older, South Asian remains were deposited over an extended period or time, while the younger, Mediterranean and Southeast Asian group of remains was deposited during a single event. =Conservation concerns= There is a growing concern about the regular loss of skeletons and it is feared that, if steps are not taken to conserve them, the skeletons may gradually vanish in the years to come. It is reported that tourists visiting the area are in the habit of taking back the bones in large numbers and the district administration has expressed the need to protect the area. The district magistrate of Chamoli District has reported that tourists, trekkers, and curious researchers are transporting the skeletons on mules and recommended that the area should be protected. Government agencies have made efforts to develop the area as an eco-tourism destination to protect the skeletons. Tourism Trekking path to Roopkund, passing near Bedni Bugyal Roopkund is a picturesque tourist destination and one of the important places for trekking in Chamoli District, Himalayas, near the base of two Himalayan peaks: Trisul (7,120 m) and Nanda Ghunti (6,310 m). The Lake is flanked by a rock face named Junargali to the North and a peak named Chandania Kot to the East. A religious festival is held at the alpine meadow of Bedni Bugyal every autumn with nearby villages participating. A larger celebration, the Nanda Devi Raj Jat, takes place once every twelve years at Roopkund, during which Goddess Nanda is worshipped. The lake is covered with ice for most of the year, with the best time to trek being in autumn (mid-September to October). In popular culture Roopkund's skeletons were featured in a National Geographic documentary, \\"Riddles of the Dead: Skeleton Lake\\".Riddles of the Dead Episode Guide, National Geographic Channel See also *List of unsolved deaths ReferencesFurther reading * Aitken, Bill.

N√•lebinding (Danish: literally \\"binding with a needle\\" or \\"needle-binding\\", also naalbinding, n√•lbinding, n√•lbindning or naalebinding) is a fabric creation technique predating both knitting and crochet. Also known in English as \\"knotless netting,\\" \\"knotless knitting,\\" or \\"single needle knitting,\\" the technique is distinct from crochet in that it involves passing the full length of the working thread through each loop, unlike crochet where the work is formed only of loops, never involving the free end. It also differs from knitting in that lengths must be pieced together during the process of n√•lebinding, rather than a continuous strand of yarn that can easily be pulled out. Archaeological specimens of fabric made by n√•lebinding can be difficult to distinguish from knitted fabric. N√•lebinding is still practiced by women of the Nanti tribe, an indigenous people of the Camisea region of Peru. They use it to make bracelets. N√•lebinding also remains popular in the Scandinavian countries as well as in the Balkans. History The oldest known textile fragment of N√•lbinding dating from c. 6500 BC was found in Nehal Hemar cave, Israel. Another made of lime bast fibre, from the Erteb√∏lle period c. 4200 BC was found in Tybrind Vig, a Mesolithic fishing village in Denmark. The oldest known samples of single- needle knitted clothing include the color-patterned sandal socks of the Coptic Christians of Egypt (4th century CE), and hats and shawls from the Paracas and Nazca cultures in Peru, dated between 300 BC and 300 AD. Historically needles were made out of wood, antler or bone. Contemporary selections also include plastic. N√•lbinding is believed to predate knitting and crochet. Historical samples have often been misidentified as knitting due to how similar they can appear in the finished products if made using the Coptic stitch. Often a textile historian will need to closely follow the path of the yarn itself to identify the item as either knitting or n√•lbinding. This is possible by knowing the textile structures created by the two crafts and identifying those within the fabric or by looking for a frequent use of joining of strands. N√•lbinding was used during the Viking-age of 793‚Äì1066 AD in Scandinavia before knitting and crochet were known. This was an effective method for them to create sturdy, serviceable garments. N√•lbinding works well with short pieces of yarn. Based on this, scholars believe that the technique may be ancient, as long continuous lengths of yarn are not necessary. The term \\"n√•lebinding\\" was introduced in the 1970s. A famous piece of n√•lbinding is the 'Coppergate sock' found during an excavation of the Coppergate area of York. A clear Viking influence in the textiles was found in the finds in this area. This was a wool sock that had been created using a technique never before recorded in England. The sock was slipper-like in style and would have covered the whole foot. N√•lbinding was used in some regions of Northern Europe until the 1950s, when it most likely declined because of the changes in the textile industry and almost disappeared. It later gained renewed interest among many textile historians, archaeologists, craftspeople and reenactors, so that it is today an exotic but well-kept handicraft tradition. Technique The method creates an elastic fabric using short lengths of yarn and a single-eyed needle that is often broad and flat. The stitches are commonly, but not invariably, gauged by wrapping them around the thumb. In its simplest form, the needle is passed through a seed loop to form a new loop, taking care to avoid tightening either into a firm knot. The needle is then passed through the new loop, repeating the process until a chain of desired length has been formed. Subsequent stitches are formed in the same manner but are also joined laterally to the corresponding stitch in the chain. The extended process is similarly repeated with reference to the preceding row rather than the initial chain. Fabric is commonly worked in a single direction ‚Äì \\"in the round\\" ‚Äì forming spirals and tubes for socks and mittens. The work may also be turned at the end of a row for fabric \\"worked flat\\". Specialised notation is used to indicate the path of the needle as it is worked through the preexisting fabric, with its passage under a loop shown as U and over a loop as O. A slash shows where the yarn changes direction and returns through loops it has already passed. If a loop is skipped an O or a U is put in brackets. If there is more than one change of direction a colon is used. The connection to the previous row is described using the letter F (if the yarn passes through the loop from the front) or B (if the yarn passes through the loop from the back), as well as a number to show how many loops are worked in this way. Stitches that can be described in this manner vary significantly in appearance, texture, and elasticity. As an example, the Coppergate sock described above was made in York stitch, or UU/OO O F2. As an example to show the use of brackets and colons, the √Ölse stitch is U(U)O/UO:UO O. Some people prefer to use superscript numbers to describe the age of the passed loops, as it provides a clearer description for practical nalbinding than the brackets and colons. Wool yarn is often used because short lengths of it can easily be joined together, as the technique intrinsically requires. However, yarn made of fibers that do not felt as easily can be joined in other ways. In the construction of the 'Coppergate sock', the work began at the toe and worked in circular rows. Looping continued by the passing of the needle through two loops of the previous row, one of which had already been worked, and then brought back through the last two loops of the current row. A heavy, thick fabric was created with great elasticity. No loose ends were visible and are thought to be joined by splicing or having been stitched into the fabric. Shaping was achieved by adding an extra loop or leaving a lower loop out of the sequence. The heel had been turned back on itself several times to create the heel shaping.  Characteristics  Due to the \\"pulling through,\\" this technique is well adapted to short lengths of yarn which can be joined together to form a textile. N√•lebinding is repeatedly called more laborious and slower than knitting. This is not necessarily true, especially for the simpler stitches, such as the Oslo-, Mammen- and Brod√©n- stitches. Although each stitch might take slightly longer than a knitted one, n√•lbinding is often quicker than knitting, because each row's height (in the most common n√•lbinding-techniques) corresponds to 2‚Äì3 rows of knitting. It is also easier on the shoulders, back and hands, and the fabric it produces can be more dense and durable than knitted fabric. It is still used in Peru and Iran to make socks, and in parts of Scandinavia to make hats, gloves and other items that are very warm. Members of the Society for Creative Anachronism may use n√•lebinding to produce durable and authentic head covers for use under armor. Another common mistake is to think of n√•lbinding as superior to knitting, because it requires more skill. It is very easy to learn and master; given proper instruction, even the more complex techniques are quite possible to learn with comparably little prior knowledge (though some is recommended). It can create different textiles, thin and flexible ones as well as thick and comparably stiff ones, depending on which technique is used. It is equally false to say knitting is superior to n√•lbinding. They are different; each has advantages and disadvantages. N√•lbinding does not unravel and therefore special finishing borders are not necessary.

The battle had been preceded by the Battle of Aguere, fought on 14-15 November that year, which had been a Castilian victory. Advancing along the northern shores of the island, the Spaniards pursued the remaining Guanche forces and faced them once again at Valley of Taoro, near Acentejo, the site of the first battle, called by the Spaniards La Matanza (\\"The Slaughter\\"). Adelantado (\\"military governor\\") Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo divided his forces into two, with the Castilians bearing firearms taking the advantage. After three hours of fighting, the Guanches were defeated. Those who were not made prisoners of the Spaniards fled to the mountains. With shouts of \\"Victory! Victory!\\" the Spanish forces celebrated their triumph, and Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo erected a hermitage in honor of Our Lady of Victory on the site of the battle. A town grew up around it, called La Victoria de Acentejo. An old Canary Island pine, a witness to the battle, still stands in La Victoria de Acentejo. In its shadow the first mass was celebrated on the day of the battle. From its branches a bell was later hung, since the hermitage that Fern√°ndez de Lugo built in the same spot lacked a bell tower. The mencey Bentor is said to have thrown himself from the heights of Tigaiga after learning of the outcome of the battle. The pine at La Victoria de Acentejo The Second Battle of Acentejo was certainly not the last battle on Tenerife between the Spaniards and the Guanches, but was certainly the most decisive, resulting in the ultimate incorporation of the island into the Kingdom of Castile and the final subjugation of the aborigines.

In the United States, both beef pot pie and chicken pot pie are the most popular types of pot pies and can vary significantly in terms of both preparation and ingredients. Origin and history Pot pie is believed to have originated in Greece. The Greeks cooked meats mixed with other ingredients in open pastry shells, and these were called Artocreas. In the United States in the 19th century, Americans became enamored of a pie that featured robins. The settlers who came to the United States took their pot pie recipes with them when they moved westward. By the present century, beef pot pies and chicken pot pies had become a widely popular American dish and are now mass-produced and sold in the frozen food aisles of most supermarkets in the United States. Preparation A chicken pot pie made with puff pastry Pot pie can be prepared in a number of ways including in a skillet over a stovetop, in a baking dish in an oven, or in a Mountain Pie Iron over a campfire. Common ingredients include diced chicken, carrots, celery, onion, peas, seasonings and chicken broth (thickened with milk and flour) and in the case of beef pot pie, may also include diced potatoes and beef broth instead of chicken broth.

He ranks as one of Nevada's most distinguished literary figures of the 20th century, and was the first inductee into the 'Nevada Writers Hall of Fame' in 1988, together with Robert Laxalt, Clark's mentee and Nevada's other heralded twentieth century author. Two of Clark's novels, The Ox-Bow Incident and The Track of the Cat, were made into films. As a writer, Clark taught himself to use the familiar materials of the western saga to explore the human psyche and to raise deep philosophical issues. Biography Born in East Orland, Maine, Clark grew up, graduated from Reno High School in 1926 and went to college at the University of Nevada, where his father, Walter Ernest Clark, was president of the University of Nevada. In 1933 Clark married Barbara Frances Morse and moved to Cazenovia, New York, where he taught high school English and began his fiction-writing career. Clark's first published novel, The Ox-Bow Incident (1940), was successful and is often considered to be the first modern Western, without the usual clich√©s and formulaic plots of the genre.\\"Biography - Clark, Walter Van Tilburg (1909-1971)\\", Contemporary Authors (Biography), Thomson Gale, 2004. The novel is a story about a lynch mob mistaking three innocent travelers for cattle rustlers suspected of murder. After the travelers are hanged, the lynch mob finds that they killed the wrong suspects. The novel's themes include an examination of frontier law and order, as well as culpability. The novel was well-received, gave Clark literary acclaim that was unusual for a writer of Westerns, and in 1943 was adapted into a movie starring Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan. Over the next decade, Clark published two more novels: The City of Trembling Leaves (1945) and The Track of the Cat (1949). In 1950, a collection of short stories, The Watchful Gods and Other Stories, was released. Since they began appearing in national magazines during the 1940s, Clark's short stories gained national recognition and earned the O. Henry Prize five times, in quick succession, between 1941 and 1945. After this initial success in the short story format, some of these stories (notably \\"Hook\\" and \\"The Wind And The Snow Of Winter\\") have been repeatedly anthologized as classic examples of the genre.Walter Van Tilburg Clark: The reason for the Nevada author‚Äôs sudden silence is still shrouded in mystery by Michael Engelmann, accessed 08 November 2014 via web.archive.org. Clark's short story, \\"The Portable Phonograph\\" - a poignant depiction of survivors in the aftermath of nuclear war - is also well known. Two Hollywood films were inspired by Clark's writings, and one of these (The Ox-Bow Incident) received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The other film was Track of the Cat, based on Clark's novel The Track of the Cat. (Note that the film's title drops the definite article used in the novel's title). Although he continued to write more sporadically after 1950, Clark published no more fiction works during the remaining two decades of his life. Thereafter, Clark devoted his creative energies to teaching and lecturing. From 1954 to 1956, he was a professor of creative writing at the University of Montana in Missoula, where he was noted by his students for his teaching skills and for his eccentric clothing which consisted of a blue turtleneck shirt, maroon corduroy jacket, grey slacks and blue socks which never varied throughout the term. Clark began teaching at a writer's workshop at San Francisco State University during the summer of 1955, moving to San Francisco in 1956 after he was hired there full-time to establish a formal Creative Writing Program. He remained there until 1962. Clark would return to Reno to serve as the writer-in-residence at the university from 1962 until his death from cancer in Virginia City, Nevada on November 10, 1971 at aged 62. He spent the last ten years of his life editing The Journals of Alfred Doten. He died almost two years to the day after the death of his wife Barbara (Frances Morse) Clark (December 16, 1906 - November 12, 1969). Barbara Clark's date of birth is determined by enlarging the picture of the grave marker at the cited \\"find-a-grave\\" website here, because it clearly shows December 16. This same website, however, lists her birth-date incorrectly as November 10. Both of them died of cancer, as Clark's biographer Jackson J. Benson noted in his biography of Clark, The Ox-Bow Man. Clark was chosen, along with Robert Laxalt, to be the first writer inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame when it was established in 1988 by the Friends of the University of Nevada Libraries.

The station was built north of Sidcup town centre in the parish of Lamorbey. It had a small goods yard positioned on the down side and a station master's house. A new booking office was built in 1887. In the early 1890s a signal box was built on the up side which was in use until November 1970. A station hotel was built near the entrance to the goods yard. The hotel was demolished in 1975.http://www.kentrail.org.uk/Sidcup.htm In the 1930s the station was partially rebuilt with new platform canopies. In 1955 the platforms were lengthened to take ten coach trains. In 1965 a footbridge was constructed between the up and down platforms which allowed the closure of the down side booking office. The goods yard closed in August 1966. The following year a short turnback siding was opened at a cost of ¬£50,000 on the down side to the east of the platforms on part of the former goods yard. This enabled services to start or terminate from the station without blocking the main running lines. It was extended in 2013 to accommodate 12 car trains.

It is an active stratovolcano lying on the island of Fogo. The main cone last erupted in 1680, causing mass emigration from the island. A subsidiary vent erupted in 1995. The only deadly eruption was in 1847 when earthquakes killed several people. Fogo is a hotspot volcanic island. Its most recent eruptions occurred in 1951, 1995 and 2014. It is the youngest and most active volcano in the Cape Verde Islands, a short chain of volcanic islands that generally are younger at the western end, formed as the African Plate moved towards the east over the hotspot. Fogo consists of a single volcano, so the island is nearly round and about in diameter. The large summit caldera (about 10 kilometers in the north-south direction and 7 kilometers in the east-west direction) is not located in the center of the island, but rather towards its northeastern corner. The caldera is bounded by steep near-vertical fault scarps on the north, west, and south sides but is breached to the east where lava can flow to the coast. North-northeast-trending eruptive fissures opened along the western flank of Pico, which formed inside the caldera between about 1500 and 1760. The last eruption from the top was in 1769. The current topography of Fogo, with the caldera open to the sea on the east side, results from the sliding of the east flank of the volcano towards the ocean. The mountain's slopes are used to grow coffee, while its lava is used as building material. Near its peak is a caldera and a small village, Ch√£ das Caldeiras, is inside this caldera. The crater rim, which reaches 2,700 m elevation, is known as Bordeira. 73,000 years ago The eastern side of Fogo collapsed into the ocean 73,000 years ago, creating a tsunami 170 meters high which struck the nearby island of Santiago. The tsunami was dated by isotope analysis of boulders deposited on Santiago. 1680 eruption In 1680 AD, a major summit eruption of Pico do Fogo produced large ash falls over the whole island rendering agricultural lands temporarily unusable and triggering mass emigration from the island, to Brava in particular. 1995 eruption The 1995 eruption began on the night of 2‚Äì3 April, covering the island with a cloud of ash. Residents were evacuated from Ch√£ das Caldeiras, as their homes were destroyed. Satellite image of Fogo. Residents reported that the eruption was preceded by small earthquakes which began about six days prior to the first eruption of lava. These earthquakes increased in magnitude and frequency through April 2, and a particularly strong one was reported at about 8 p.m., four hours before the eruption apparently began. Just after midnight, fissures opened on the flank of Pico. One resident said it looked as if the cone had \\"been cut by a knife.\\" The eruption began with Strombolian activity, quickly followed by a 'curtain-of-fire' lava fountain that fed a flow which cut off the road to the village of Portela by 2 a.m. The 1,300 people living inside the caldera fled during the night to the safety of villages on the north coast. No one was killed, but about 20 people required medical attention. During the day on April 3, the island was engulfed by a thick cloud of dark ash that reached 2.5 to 5 kilometers high. The initial flows were pahoehoe lava, although their extent was apparently small. The violent eruption produced lava bombs up to 4 meters across that were ejected as far as 500 meters from the vents. On April 4, lava fountains reached 400 meters high beneath a cloud of ash about 2 kilometers high. A new scoria cone formed that was open to the southwest and fed a growing lava flow. On April 5, the new lava flow reached the western caldera wall and destroyed about five houses and the main water reservoir. During these first few days, civil authorities evacuated about 3,000 people. Ch√£ das Caldeiras and main ash cone, Fogo, 2009 The eruption became steadier after the first few days, and moderate, Hawaiian- style lava fountains about 100‚Äì120 meters high built a spatter cone more than 140 meters high. The flows were lava, and flowed towards the west to the caldera wall, then turned north. These flows advanced episodically as pressure built from ponding and thickening of the flows. On April 13, a second lava flow began to cover an earlier, stagnant lava flow, and was almost entirely on top of the earlier flow until April 15, when it spread out and destroyed another home. Cinder fell as far as two kilometers south of the vents on April 15. By the 17th, the flow had advanced to within 420 meters of the nearest house in the village of Portela. On April 18, a portable seismometer began to record much stronger volcanic tremors that indicated a change in eruptive style from lava fountains back to Strombolian activity. Spatter was discharged every 3‚Äì8 seconds with loud gas bursts. In addition, the eruptive rate increased and the upper 300 meters of the channel was largely pahoehoe lava. The eruption rates, estimated from the dimensions and flow rates in the channel, were between 4 and 8.5 million cubic meters per day. During the night of April 18, a series of large, explosive bursts occurred that may have followed collapse of parts of the cone into the vents and subsequent explosive clearing of the debris. By morning, the activity had returned to lava fountaining, and the seismic record was much quieter. The lava flows continued to thicken, and lava ponded along the central channel. Pico de Fogo (crater). 2014-15 eruption The Fogo volcano returned to activity in 2014, having started erupting shortly after 10 a.m. of Sunday, 23 November 2014. There had been a few days of heightened seismic activity, but they worsened beginning at 8 p.m. on Saturday night. The population of Ch√£ das Caldeiras, totaling around 1,000 inhabitants, spent the night outside their homes due to the strong earthquakes, and started being evacuated when the eruption began. As in 1995, some people initially refused to abandon their homes, but eventually heeded the authorities' instructions. Bruno Faria, a Cape Verdean vulcanologist, said the intensity of the eruption surpassed that of the 1995 eruption, and approached that of the 1951 eruption, one of the strongest ever recorded on the island. The eruption gained in intensity after 23 November 2014.The village of Portela in the Ch√£ das Caldeiras is now covered by a lava stream which has completely destroyed the housing stock. After 77 days of activity, the eruption stopped on 8 February 2015. 75% of the buildings in Portela, Bangaeira and Ilh√©u de Losna, sections of Ch√£ das Caldeiras, had been destroyed. Most of these had been covered by lava. Geology Pico do Fogo consists of basanite, tephrite, phonotephrite, clinopyroxene, amphibole, magnetite, olivine, melilite and leucite. The main magma chamber is about 16-24 km deep, into the ocean crust and 10-12 km in the bottom of the crust.

Biography Powell was born in Mount Gilead, Ohio, a village 45 miles north of Columbus and the county seat of Morrow County. Powell regularly gave her birth year as 1897 but primary documents support the earlier date.Her New York Times obituary, November 16, 1965, lists her birth date as November 28, 1897. The Ohio, Births and Christenings Index in Ancestry.com lists her full name as \\"Marthy Dawn Powell,\\" and her birth date as September 28, 1896. Other U.S. Census data is more vague. After her mother died when Powell was seven, she lived with a series of relatives around the state. Her father remarried, but his second wife was harsh and abusive toward the children; when her stepmother destroyed her notebooks and diaries, she ran away to live with an aunt, who encouraged her creative work. Powell later gave her childhood fictional form in the novel My Home Is Far Away (1944). At Lake Erie College in Painesville, Ohio, she wrote stories and plays, acted in college productions, and edited the college newspaper. After graduation, she moved to Manhattan. Most of her subsequent writing would deal either with life in small Midwestern towns, or with the lives of people transplanted to New York City from such towns. On November 20, 1920, she married Joseph Gousha, an aspiring poet and advertising copy-writer. In 1921, the couple had their only child, Joseph R. Gousha Jr. (\\"Jojo\\"), who would today likely be diagnosed with autism. Her husband abandoned poetry for the steady work of advertising, and the family moved to Greenwich Village, which remained her home base for the rest of her life. The Village served as both inspiration and backdrop for most of her writing; some of the key locations in her fiction remain standing today.\\"Still Living in Dawn Powell's Village,\\" Off the Grid, Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, December 10, 2013. Novels Dawn Powell wrote hundreds of short stories, ten plays, a dozen novels, and an extended diary starting in 1931. Her writings, however, never generated enough money to live off. Throughout her life, she supported herself with various jobs, including being a freelance writer, an extra in silent films, a Hollywood screenwriter, a book reviewer, and a radio personality. Her novel Whither was published in 1925, but she always described She Walks in Beauty (1928) as her first. Her favorite of her own novels, Dance Night, came out in 1930. The early work received uneven reviews, and none of it sold well. Her 1936 novel Turn, Magic Wheel, the first work that received both critical acclaim and reasonably good sales, marked a turn to social satire in a New York setting. Her play Walking Down Broadway was filmed as Hello, Sister! (1933), co-written and co-directed by Erich von Stroheim. In 1939, Scribner's became her publisher and Maxwell Perkins became her editor. In 1942, Powell published her first commercially successful novel, A Time to Be Born, whose central figure‚ÄîAmanda Keeler Evans, an egotistical hack writer whose work and media presence are bolstered by the assiduous promotion of her husband, the newspaper magnate Julian Evans‚Äîis loosely modelled on Clare Boothe Luce, wife of Henry Luce.\\"In New York, Shows Can Be Slow or Fast in the Making\\", Jason Zinoman, New York Times, August 26, 2006. Retrieved July 30, 2011. A musical adaptation of the novel, written by Tajlei Levis and John Mercurio, was staged in New York City in 2006. After the war, Powell's output slowed down, but it included some of her most acclaimed New York novels, including The Locusts Have No King (1948), a portrait of the disintegration and eventual rekindling of a love affair against the background of the city and the onset of the Cold War. The novel ends with news of the Bikini Atoll atom-bomb tests. Two late novels show Powell's interest in the New York art world of the 1950s: The Wicked Pavilion (1954), an ensemble portrait of the characters orbiting around the Cafe Julien (a fictionalized Hotel Brevoort)Library of America essay by Gore Vidal (1987) and a vanished or deceased painter named Marius; and The Golden Spur (1962), set in a fictionalized Cedar Tavern, in which a young man's search for the identity and history of his dead father brings him to New York, where he becomes involved with the circle around a charismatic painter, Hugow. Old age and death Later in life, Powell did most of her writing in an apartment at 95 Christopher Street.\\"Dawn Powell, Novelist, Is Dead; Author of Witty, Satirical Books; Middle Class Was the Object of Her Stinging Fiction-13 Books Published\\", The New York Times, November 16, 1965. \\"Miss Powell, who had resided in Greenwich Village most of her life, maintained an apartment at 95 Christopher Street, where she did most of her writing in recent years.\\" Powell died slowly and painfully of colon cancer, fourteen days away from her 69th birthday, which afflicted her in 1964 and killed her the following year. She donated her body to the Cornell Medical Center, which offered to return parts of it five years later for burial. Her executrix, Jacqueline Miller Rice (1931-2004)Paid Notice: Deaths Rice, Jacqueline Miller. (2004, January 18). The New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/18/classified/paid-notice-deaths-rice- jacqueline-miller.html, refused to claim the remains, which were then buried on Hart Island, New York City's potter's field. Revival When Powell died, virtually all of her novels were out of print. Her posthumous champions included Matthew Josephson, Gore Vidal, and especially Tim Page, who joined forces with her family to free her manuscripts, diaries, and copyrights from her original executrix. The result was a revival in the late 1990s, when most of Powell's books were made available once more. Her papers are now in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library of Columbia University in New York. Powell is referenced in the Gilmore Girls episode \\"Help Wanted\\", in which Rory expresses sadness over her relative obscurity. She is also referenced in the novel A Collection of Beauties at the Height of Their Popularity by Whitney Otto. She is also referenced by the novelist Alan Furst in his 2014 work Midnight in Europe. She appears as a character in several scenes of Vidal's novel The Golden Age. The Message of the City: Dawn Powell's New York Novels by Patricia E. Palermo was published in 2016. It is a compilation of most of the critical work done on Powell, in her day and in ours, and also looks at how she turned her everyday life, discussed in her diaries and letters, into fiction.

It is down the line from . The station and all trains serving it are operated by Southeastern. Down trains run eastbound to Dartford, Gravesend and to London Cannon Street via Slade Green, and up trains run westbound to Cannon Street and London Charing Cross via Lewisham. Ticket barriers are in operation. History Crayford station was opened in September 1866. The original station building, like most of the Dartford Loop Line stations, was built cheaply of clapboard. The station had a brick-built goods shed on the up side. The goods yard had only two tracks with no direct connection to the adjacent waterworks, brickworks and gravel pit. Two additional sidings were eventually constructed on the down side. For many years there was no connection between the two platforms except for a track crossing. A footbridge was provided at the eastern ends of the platforms in 1926 when the line was electrified. A SER-designed signal box at the western end of the down platform was built around 1892. In 1955 both platforms were lengthened to accommodate ten carriage trains. The goods yard closed in May 1963. In 1968 the station buildings were completely rebuilt using pre- fabricated CLASP structures. The signal box closed in November 1970.London Suburban Railways - Lewisham to Dartford by Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith (Middleton Press 1991) The footbridge remains the oldest part of the station. The two sidings on the down side remained for many years and were still in use until the mid-1990s. By 2000 the sidings had fallen out of use and were subsequently disconnected, but the sleepers and rails still remain in position. In 2000 the ticket office caught fire and was damaged beyond economical repair. The following year a new building appeared in its place together with palisade fencing alongside the rear of both platforms.http://www.kentrail.org.uk/Crayford.htm Location The station is situated in Lower Station Road, close to Crayford Town Centre.

Founded by Glenn Terry and Bill Dobson in 1982, it is held on the last Sunday of each year. The parade, which uses the motto \\"Putting the 'nut' in Coconut Grove\\", is composed of floats mocking local and national stories from the previous year.  History  A group calling themselves the \\"Narcissistic Selfie Association (NSA)\\", one of the floats in the 2013 parade. Members of the float frequently ran into audience to take selfies with them. The King Mango Strut was started in 1982 by Glenn Terry and Bill Dobson as a parody of the annual King Orange Jamboree Parade for the Orange Bowl. After Terry and Dobson's group, the Mango Marching Band, was denied entry into the King Orange Jamboree Parade due to their use of kazoos, conch shells, and garbage can drums as instruments, the pair held their own parade, with an initially by simply marking the ends of a street with signs. In 2009 Glenn Terry and group treasurer Antoinette Baldwin got into a public dispute over the creative direction of the Strut, which culminated in the city choosing Baldwin to run the event, and Terry refusing to march in the parade in protest. The parade is now run by King Mango Productions, a non-profit organization headed by Mike Lucas. Overview The parade lampoons both local and national figures and issues. In 1986, the parade included a group of people dressed as members of the sex and drug trades, calling themselves the \\"Biscayne Boulevard Chamber of Commerce\\". In 1996 several floats poked fun at the City of Miami's debt crisis, including a mock auction of city buildings. In 1997 and 2000, floats mocked the area's history of voting irregularities, with the latter year focusing on the issues the state faced during the 2000 presidential election. There is no stringent entry process for participants. Simply showing up to a meeting and announcing a desire to participate is enough. In one case, a group showed up on the day of the event, with no prior notice, and was allowed to march with the parade. The Miami chapter of the Sierra Club has participated since 1988, and a local Hare Krishna group is also a long time participant.

Wednesday, May 27, 2020 Most usually it is applied to textual documents or programmatic source code. Such asynchronous (non-simultaneous) contributions are very efficient in time, as group members need not assemble in order to work together. Generally, managing such work requires software;Kuutti, Kari et al. (2003). ECSCW 2003: proceedings of the Eighth European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, p. 315. the most common tools for editing documents are wikis, and those for programming, version control systems. Most word processors are also capable of recording changes; this allows editors to work on the same document while automatically clearly labeling who contributed what changes. New writing environments such as Google Docs provide collaborative writing/editing functionalities with revision control, synchronous/asynchronous editing. Another tool that uses collaborative editing is Addteq's Excellentable. Excellentable is an app for Confluence that enables users to collaborate on spreadsheets in real-time directly inside of Confluence. Wikipedia is an example of a collaborative editing project on a large scale, which can be both good and bad, because of the large contributions by the public, Wikipedia has one of the widest ranges of material in the world. Unfortunately, this also leads to online 'graffiti', in which members of the public can submit incorrect information or random rubbish. Collaborative writing can lead to projects that are richer and more complex than those produced by individuals. Many learning communities include one or more collaborative assignments. However, writing with others also makes the writing task more complex. There is increasing amount of research literature investigating how collaborative writing can improve learning experiences.R.A Calvo and S.T O‚ÄôRourke and J. Jones and K. Yacef and P. Reimann.

Early years Matthew Williamson was born in Manchester and studied in Loreto College until he was 17 years old. He then moved to London to attend school at Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design, in 1994. Career His eponymous fashion house was founded in February 1997. The same year, he debuted his collection 'Electric Angels' at London Fashion Week. His collections were displayed during New York Fashion week in 2002. His store at 28 Bruton Street, in Mayfair, London, followed in 2004. In 2005, he launched his perfume range and the following year he was appointed Creative Director at Emilio Pucci. In 2007, a runway show of his designs was incorporated into the video for Prince's song \\"Chelsea Rodgers\\" from his Planet Earth album. In 2007, the Design Museum, London, hosted a retrospective of his work entitled \\"Matthew Williamson ‚Äì 10 years in Fashion\\". In 2008, Williamson was awarded the \\"Red Carpet Designer\\" accolade at the British Fashion Awards where he has also received three nominations for Designer of the Year. In September 2008, Williamson returned to London full-time to focus fully on his own label's forthcoming ventures and expansion. He made a guest appearance on season 7 of Project Runway. The episode aired on 28 January 2010. In Autumn 2010, a self-titled book was published by Rizzoli. The book is written by Colin McDowell with a foreword by Sienna Miller, and contributions from Anna Wintour, Alexandra Shulman and Diane von F√ºrstenberg. An accompanying photographic exhibition marked the book launch at Somerset House. September 2012 marked the 15th anniversary of Williamson's career.

The film, titled XV, stars friends of the brand including Sienna Miller, Andrea Riseborough and Poppy Delevingne. It was showcased exclusively on Net-a-Porter.com alongside a limited edition Swarovski collection of crystal dresses. Williamson then expanded into the home and lifestyle sectors. 2013 saw the launch of his collaboration with Osborne & Little on a range of home furnishing fabrics and wallpapers. The second collection was released in 2014, titled 'Samana', and the third in 2015, titled 'Cubana'.

(; 8 January 16016 December 1658), better known as Baltasar Graci√°n, was a Spanish Jesuit and baroque prose writer and philosopher. He was born in Belmonte, near Calatayud (Aragon). His writings were lauded by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Biography The son of a doctor, in his childhood Graci√°n lived with his uncle, who was a priest. He studied at a Jesuit school in 1621 and 1623 and theology in Zaragoza. He was ordained in 1627 and took his final vows in 1635. He assumed the vows of the Jesuits in 1633 and dedicated himself to teaching in various Jesuit schools. He spent time in Huesca, where he befriended the local scholar Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa, who helped him achieve an important milestone in his intellectual upbringing. He acquired fame as a preacher, although some of his oratorical displays, such as reading a letter sent from Hell from the pulpit, were frowned upon by his superiors. He was named Rector of the Jesuit College of Tarragona and wrote works proposing models for courtly conduct such as El h√©roe (The Hero), El pol√≠tico (The Politician), and El discreto (The Discreet One). During the Spanish war, he was chaplain of the army that liberated Lleida in 1646. In 1651, he published the first part of the Critic√≥n (Faultfinder) without the permission of his superiors, whom he disobeyed repeatedly. This attracted the Society's displeasure. Ignoring the reprimands, he published the second part of Critic√≥n in 1657, as a result was sanctioned and exiled to Graus at the beginning of 1658. Soon Gracian wrote to apply for membership in another religious order. His demand was not met, but his sanction was eased off: in April 1658 he was sent to several minor positions under the College of Tarazona. His physical decline prevented him from attending the provincial congregation of Calatayud and on 6 December 1658 Gracian died in Tarazona, near Zaragoza in the Kingdom of Aragon. Graci√°n is the most representative writer of the Spanish Baroque literary style known as Conceptismo (Conceptism), of which he was the most important theoretician; his Agudeza y arte de ingenio (Wit and the Art of Inventiveness) is at once a poetic, a rhetoric and an anthology of the conceptist style. The Aragonese village where he was born, Belmonte de Calatayud, changed its name to Belmonte de Graci√°n in his honour. Critic√≥n Critic√≥n, first edition (1651). The three parts of the Critic√≥n, published in 1651, 1653, and 1657, achieved fame in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries. It is, without a doubt, the author's masterpiece and one of the great works of the Siglo de Oro. It is a lengthy allegorical novel with philosophical overtones. It recalls the Byzantine style of novel in its many vicissitudes and in the numerous adventures to which the characters are subjected, as well as the picaresque novel in its satirical take on society, as evidenced in the long pilgrimage undertaken by the main characters, Critilo, the \\"critical man\\" who personifies disillusionment, and Andrenio, the \\"natural man\\" who represents innocence and primitive impulses. The author constantly exhibits a perspectivist technique that unfolds according to the criteria or points of view of both characters, but in an antithetical rather than plural way as in Miguel de Cervantes. The novel reveals a philosophy, pessimism, with which one of its greatest readers and admirers, the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, identified. The following is a summary of the Critic√≥n, reduced almost to the point of a sketch, of a complex work that demands detailed study. Critilo, man of the world, is shipwrecked on the coast of the island of Santa Elena, where he meets Andrenio, the natural man, who has grown up completely ignorant of civilization. Together they undertake a long voyage to the Isle of Immortality, travelling the long and prickly road of life. In the first part, \\"En la primavera de la ni√±ez\\" (\\"In the Spring of Childhood\\"), they join the royal court, where they suffer all manner of disappointments; in the second part, \\"En el oto√±o de la varonil edad\\" (\\"In the Autumn of the Age of Manliness\\"), they pass through Aragon, where they visit the house of Salastano (an anagram of the name of Graci√°n's friend Lastanosa), and travel to France, which the author calls the \\"wasteland of Hipocrinda\\", populated entirely by hypocrites and dunces, ending with a visit to a house of lunatics. In the third part, \\"En el invierno de la vejez\\" (\\"In the Winter of Old Age\\"), they arrive in Rome, where they encounter an academy where they meet the most inventive of men, arriving finally at the Isle of Immortality. He is intelligent and contributed greatly to the world. One of his most famous phrases is \\"Respect yourself if you would have others respect you.\\" 170px The Art of Worldly Wisdom Graci√°n's style, generically called conceptism, is characterized by ellipsis and the concentration of a maximum of significance in a minimum of form, an approach referred to in Spanish as agudeza (wit), and which is brought to its extreme in the Or√°culo Manual y Arte de Prudencia (literally Manual Oracle and Art of Discretion, commonly translated as The Art of Worldly Wisdom), which is almost entirely composed of three hundred maxims with commentary. He constantly plays with words: each phrase becomes a puzzle, using the most diverse rhetorical devices. Its appeal has endured: in 1992, Christopher Maurer's translation of this book remained 18 weeks (2 weeks in first place) in The Washington Post's list of Nonfiction General Best Sellers. It has sold nearly 200,000 copies. Critical reception The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica wrote of Graci√°n that: \\"He has been excessively praised by Schopenhauer, whose appreciation of the author induced him to translate the Or√°culo manual, and he has been unduly depreciated by Ticknor and others. He is an acute thinker and observer, misled by his systematic misanthropy and by his fantastic literary theories\\". Nietzsche wrote of the Or√°culo, \\"Europe has never produced anything finer or more complicated in matters of moral subtlety,\\" and Schopenhauer, who translated it into German, considered the book \\"Absolutely unique... a book made for constant use... a companion for life\\" for \\"those who wish to prosper in the great world.\\" A translation of the Or√°culo manual from the Spanish by Joseph Jacobs (London: Macmillan and Co., Limited), first published in 1892, was a huge commercial success, with many reprintings over the years (most recently by Shambala). Jacobs‚Äô translation is alleged to have been read by Winston Churchill, seven years later, on the ship taking him to the Boer Wars. In Paris, in 1924, a revision and reprint of the translation into French by Abraham-Nicolas Amelot de La Houssaie, with a preface by Andr√© Rouveyre, attracted a wide readership there, and was admired by Andr√© Gide. A new translation by Christopher Maurer (New York: Doubleday) became a national bestseller in the U.S. in 1992 , and the English edition, which sold almost 200,000 copies, was translated into Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and many other languages.

Her external assignment at the Foundation for the Future, a \\"semi-independent foundation to promote democracy\\" is both in the Middle East and in North Africa. Early life She was born a British national in Tripoli, Libya, to a Libyan-Turkish father and Syrian-Saudi mother. She grew up in Libya but attended Catholic boarding school in England. Her father, Khalid Alwalid Algargany, was a consultant of King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, King Saud and King Faisal.  Adulthood  She did her undergraduate studies at London School of Economics, and continued post-graduate education at University of Oxford to earn a master's degree in International Relations in 1983 from St Antony's College. During the late 1980s, she relocated to the United States and married Bulent Ali Riza, and they have a son. The marriage later ended in divorce. She speaks Arabic, Turkish, English, French and Italian.  Career  National Endowment for Democracy = At the National Endowment for Democracy she set up and led the endowment's Middle East programs, specializing in Middle East politics and economics field research. = U.S. Department of State = Here she was employed in the office of Elizabeth Cheney, subordinated to C. David Welch Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. Whilst there she began to spend time at the Foundation for the Future. = World Bank = Beginning as a consultant in July 1997 and then full-time in 1999, she worked with the Middle East and North Africa Social and Economic Development Group of the World Bank. First as a Senior Gender Specialist and then as a Senior Communications Officer, she was seated in the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office (MENA). By July 2002, she was acting manager for external affairs and outreach for MENA, but resigned after Paul Wolfowitz took leadership as World Bank president. = Freelance work = In 2004, Riza organized a major conference of North African and Middle Eastern groups in Beirut. Her goal was to inspire democratic reforms in the aftermath of the fall of Saddam Hussein as she felt planting democracy in Iraq will inspire other regimes to democratic goals. Riza is reportedly earns $180,000 salary after taxes in 2008, and works from home.  World Bank controversy  Riza did not report to the World Bank president, Paul Wolfowitz while at the World Bank. Riza was romantically linked to Wolfowitz prior to his World Bank involvement, when he was Deputy Secretary of Defence under Donald Rumsfeld in the Bush Administration. In 2005 Wolfowitz offered to sign a statement to isolate himself from her http://www.slate.com/id/2166136/pagenum/all/#p2 which only served to draw scrutiny to what grew into a perceived conflict of interest. The World Bank ethics committee rejected Wolfowitz's proposal after Wolfowitz refused to include recusal from professional contact with Riza in the proposal. Subsequently, Paul Wolfowitz was alleged to have involved himself in Riza's career by personally increasing her pay. This was a potential impropriety. Instead, Riza was asked to leave the World Bank altogether. She even forwent a promotion for which she was highly recommended. By 2007 the Board of the World Bank accepted that Paul Wolfowitz acted ethically. Still by June of that year Wolfowitz resigned. In retrospect, staffing policy was to the contrary. Rule 4.01, paragraph 5.2, states that spouses and registered domestic partners are barred from working in situations where \\"one supervises the other directly or indirectly\\", but informal relationships fall under rule 3.01, paragraph 4.02, which states that in such cases, as Wolfowitz and Riza's relationship, the supervisor \\"shall be responsible for seeking a resolution of the conflict of interest.\\" In 2007 Riza released an internal statement which she had submitted as part of a defence to her employers to The Wall Street Journal as follows: = Public outcry = Prominent newspapers, among them The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal condemned the fates of Wolfowitz and Riza. Christopher Hitchens described the removal of Riza and Wolfowitz as \\"character assassination.\\" He surmised that this was all due to personal conflict between the U.S. and European branches at the World Bank.http://www.slate.com/id/2166136/ Further, he surmised that this was retribution for Wolfowitz's support of the Iraq war. Robert Holland maintained that Wolfowitz's resignation has nothing to do with Riza's promotion. Holland served on the bank's board of directors until 2006.https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9558497 Sari Nusseibeh wrote an open letter to the Washington Post on April 30, 2007 about this \\"unfair and vicious campaign.\\" Andrew Young describes Riza as \\"an admired World Bank professional and a champion of human rights.\\" Sandra Day O'Connor a board member at the Foundation for the Future, describes Riza as \\"a very competent person.\\" Even Clare Selgin Wolfowitz praises Riza, \\"Shaha Riza is a dedicated and serious reform advocate who has my respect.\\" On April 17, 2007, the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal published an op-ed that characterized the scandal as a witch hunt.The Wall Street Journal Online - Featured Article The New York Times called for Wolfowitz's resignation on April 28, 2007. = World Bank stance = Wolfowitz was confirmed as president in June 2005.

History  The organization was founded in 1891 as Det Norske Lutherske Kinamisjonsforbund (in English: the Norwegian Lutheran Federation for Mission in China). The organisation's international mission was focused on China until that work came to an end in 1949. In 1966 the NLM, in cooperation with several other missional and denominational bodies, was involved in the establishment of the China Lutheran Seminary in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. The organisation has later worked in countries such as Japan, Ethiopia, Bolivia, Peru, Taiwan, the Ivory Coast, and Mongolia, in addition to the work in Norway. It has been headquartered in Oslo since 1913.Norsk Luthersk Misjonssamband Store Norske Leksikon, retrieved 22 February 2012  Doctrine  The NLM adheres to the confessional documents of the Church of Norway (the Bible, the Apostolic, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds, the Augsburg Confession, and Luther's Small Catechism). The organisation can be described as broadly evangelical with a focus on lay involvement. It has about 50,000 members. As inheritors of the pietist revival they are considered a conservative voice in the Norwegian context. Notably they have become known for their conservative views on same-sex marriage and female clergy (disputed among some members).  Organisation  The work in Norway is focused on traditional local prayer-houses ('bedehus') and homegroups. Outside of Norway NLM is engaged in various forms of traditional missional activities (preaching and teaching) and development projects (education, community development etc.).

Formed in 1920, the Firecrafter Organization mainly operates within the Crossroads of America Council, Indiana, but has been known to exist in other areas including Illinois and Texas. History Before the United States entered World War I, Francis O. Belzer was named the first Scout Executive of the Indianapolis Council in 1915 (known as the Indianapolis and Central Indiana Council from 1934 to 1942). With Scouting's early emphasis on athletics instead of Scoutcraft skills, many different ancillary programs were piloted throughout the United States to reinforce Scouting skills and its core values. One such program in place was the three-tiered rank system at Daniel Carter Beard's Culver Woodcraft Camp. Seeing a need for a new program in Indiana, in conjunction with Stanley L. Norton, assistant executive, and Rex Pruitt, Scoutmaster of Troop 46, Belzer created the Camper and Woodsman ranks in 1919 at Camp Chank-Tun-Un-Gi, located near Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis. The program was a success throughout the 1919 camping season, so Pruitt, Norton, and Belzer set out to create a third camp rank for the following summer. The \\"third and highest\\" rank was introduced, unnamed, in 1920. The first group of four young Woodsmen completed the requirements. It was custom to recognize the new Camper and Woodsman rank recipients at the last campfire of the camping week, and when it came time to recognize the four Scouts, they were not mentioned. As the ceremony concluded with Norton's Scoutmaster's benediction, the four Scouts were instructed to remain behind. As the rest of the campers went back to their tents to retire for the evening, those four Scouts, along with Belzer, Norton, Pruitt, and P.D. Hoelscher (the camp's physical director) became the first to take Firecrafter's Unknown Test. A fourth honorary camp rank, Minisino, was introduced in 1921 to recognize those who went above and beyond in service to Scouting and Firecrafter itself. At one point in time, many Midwestern councils had a Firecrafter program in operation. After the adoption of the Order of the Arrow on a national level, many of these programs were closed completely or merged into the Order's program. It was the only honor camping program in the Central Indiana Council until 1972, when Central Indiana Council was merged with Delaware County Council, Whitewater Area Council, and Kikthawenund Council to form the new Crossroads of America Council. Concerned Firecrafters and Arrowmen met to settle their differences, and both programs were allowed to continue. Before 1972, all Firecrafters wore a pocket flap patch on the right pocket, indicating where the member was from within the council. He also wore a 3-inch pocket patch on the right pocket, indicating his Firecrafter rank. After the merger, the Order of the Arrow was given exclusive right to the pocket flap, while Firecrafter kept its right to the temporary patch position on the pocket itself. =From 1990 to today= Firecrafter today exists in Central Indiana, Southern Illinois, and Texas. The Central Indiana Firecrafter Organization exists in Crossroads of America Council (Indianapolis). A Southern Illinois Firecrafter organization around the Flora, Illinois area operating separately of the Crossroads Fire organization which conducted a ritual as recent as 1997, who plays an important role in the history of Firecrafter today. Throughout 1997 and into 1998, there were discussions between various Council Committee members, advisers, and members of the Crossroads Firecrafter organization (on an informal basis only) to formally recognize the Southern Illinois Firecrafter organization and join the two Fires into one. This was not accomplished due to several major differences between the two associations: *The Southern Illinois organization was not sanctioned by the Okaw Valley Council in any way, shape, or form. The Council did not sanction the use of the 3-inch pocket patch as temporary insignia, nor the pocket flap that is used to identify the member's home ember (most of the members used velcro and switch between their ember flaps and Order of the Arrow insignia). *The Southern Illinois organization's requirements for Minisino are significantly different from the Crossroads organization's, creating dissension on grandfathering Minisino between the two. Illinois Minisinos generally as a rule did not wear Indiana Minisino insignia but Indiana Minisinos were permitted to wear the Illinois insignia. *There were significant operating differences between the two organizations' ritual codes. *The Royal Order of Hi-Bark remained at that time, an active part of the Southern Illinois program. There are several Indiana members who were inducted into the Royal Order of Hi-Bark in Illinois in 1993 and 1997 on an honorary basis as a token of fraternal bonds between Illinois and Indiana, and their status as Hi-Barks is not widely known except to their close Scouting friends and family. While Indiana members were invited to the Southern Illinois Rituals between 1993 and 1997, their direct involvement in the induction process there was strictly limited to an observation role only, and the invitations and knowledge of the Illinois ritual were controlled by a small group of Indiana Firecrafters. This group ensured that only Indiana Firecrafters who were willing to comply with the unspoken \\"no participation\\" rule were permitted to make the trip to Flora for the Ritual. In 1999, there were several conditions added to the Minisino Code which explicitly prohibited the wear of Southern Illinois insignia at Crossroads functions or even within the Crossroads boundaries and considered violations of the policy punishable by a council Minisino Disciplinary Committee, a controversial body composed of the Council Chief, the Council Minisino Chairman, and the Council Minisino Adviser. The 1999 Minisino Code revision made a few other changes to the Minisino program without approval by the Council Committee, specifically to administrative succession and the nomination and approval of adults for Minisino. The changes were written by the Council Chief, the Minisino Chairman, and the Minisino Adviser, without comment from any other members of the organization. This led to a temporary crisis within Firecrafter and an overhaul of its governing documents. These amendments, coupled with changing attitudes towards females in Scouting, particularly female Scouters, led to major review of the Firecrafter Constitution and By-Laws, including the Firecrafter Code and the Minisino Code. The 2000 revision of all four documents clarified inconsistencies in the administration of the program, made all language gender neutral, and provided for Firecrafter's growth into the next century. Rank system Firecrafter is divided into two Cub Scout ranks, three Boy Scout ranks, and one honor. Each rank is established so that advancement through the system is a process of building upon knowledge that a boy learned in his last camp rank and increasing his skill in scoutcraft. It is also designed to teach the boy personal responsibility and serve as a tool to encourage advancement and attendance at summer camp. *Webelos Camper is the first Cub Scout camp rank of Firecrafter, designed to be the introduction for a First-Year Webelos Scout to Boy Scouting. It is administered at either a council day camp or Webelos Adventure Camp by staff Firecrafters to a group of scouts. *Webelos Firelight is the second and final Cub Scout camp rank of Firecrafter, designed to serve as a foundation for the Arrow of Light and the young man's transition into Boy Scouting. It is only administered at Webelos Adventure Camp as the last requirement is to participate in the Spark of Interest Trail, which introduces Firecrafter in true form. Firelight is the most recent rank added to the Firecrafter rank system. *Camper is the first Boy Scout camp rank of Firecrafter. Camper is designed to supplement and support the programming for a young man's first year of camp. It is a basic review of the Tenderfoot requirements and introduces the new scout to long- term camp. The Woodsman pocket insignia. *Woodsman is the second Boy Scout camp rank of Firecrafter. Woodsman is designed to give the young man a taste of Firecrafter at its best, as well as serve as a review of Second Class requirements and reinforce Firecrafter's core values to him. Woodsman is slightly harder than Camper, naturally. The scout must build a fire which will burn for fifteen minutes without the addition of any new wood and with only two matches. He must also be able to tie several knots used around camp, and fix a meal for himself without using utensils. *Firecrafter is the third Boy Scout camp rank. Firecrafter is the mountain top experience for the third year camper in which his attentiveness to the core values of Friendship, Leadership, and Service will be put to the test. Firecrafter requires preparation before camp - a scout must have several elements of his candidacy planned prior to that point. It is designed to encourage a Scout to continue up the mountain to Eagle, and therefore, serves as a critical element of any Scouting program within the Crossroads of America Council. A young man has five days to complete the Firecrafter card, and the requirements provide a learning experience unique to each young man's character and skill level. Firecrafter carries with it several prerequisites: the scout must be 13 years of age, he must hold First Class rank, must have earned Camper and Woodsman, and he must not be 21 years of age by the time of the Firecrafter Ritual. There are several requirements for Firecrafter that serve to provide long memories for the Scout. He must make a fire-by-friction unassisted, pass five successive uniform inspections, and plan, lead, and execute a campfire program of specified format and design. At the conclusion of the in-camp candidacy, the Scout is invited to attend the inductions weekend, the Firecrafter Ritual, which is similar in form and fashion to the Order of the Arrow Ordeal and is discussed briefly below. The Minisino pocket insignia. *Minisino is the honorary camp rank of Firecrafter. Named from a Miami word meaning \\"Tried and Proven\\", a Minisino is a Firecrafter selected for the honor based upon his service to Firecrafter and to Scouting. The setting for most Minisino ceremonies is when all the campers are gathered together for flags or at a campfire. There is a skit or announcement by a Minisino. At the conclusion of the skit, he says, \\"May your tongues be silent, and your minds attentive, you are about to witness a Minisino ceremony!\\" As the beginning to the Minisino crowning ceremony states, \\"To him alone, who by his service, devotion, and achievements, proves himself worthy of high trust, comes recognition. Many may aspire, but the Gifts of Manitou are precious and descend only upon those who efforts and achievements most nearly meet his requirements...\\" The specific requirements for the honor are known only to Minisinos and Minisino candidates, but it is publicly stated in the selection ceremony that the candidate is on trial for two camping weeks to prove himself to the Minisinos in camp and his fellow Scouts. Becoming a youth Firecrafter The process for becoming a Firecrafter as a youth often serves as one of Scouting's many memorable events. After earning the Camper and Woodsman ranks, a young man is often encouraged to candidate for Firecrafter in his third year at summer camp. He is prepared for his candidacy by other youth and adult Firecrafters in his home troop, who instruct the candidate on what is expected of him throughout his candidacy and after he becomes a Firecrafter. At summer camp, a young man declares his candidacy for Firecrafter by notifying the Firecrafter Coordinator, or Consul of the Fire, of his intentions. The Consul adds the candidate to the list of candidates for the week, issues the candidate his requirement card, candidate's handbook, and fire-by-friction log. On Sunday night of camp, the candidate takes part in an induction ceremony, which explains to the candidate the expectations that he will be held to during the next week. The candidate is then free to complete his requirement card as he sees fit. All candidates meet once a day for a full field uniform inspection and brief candidate's meeting with the Consul. Three major events are part of the candidate's card. Most often, these are the events which will hold a Scout back from completing his card: *Building a fire-by-friction, unassisted, which must burn for fifteen continuous minutes. *Leading a campfire program, a form of campwide entertainment featuring skits, songs, stunts, a Scoutmaster's benediction, and a major theme. *The Firecrafter overnighter, where the Scout must demonstrate basic First Class Scout skills in preparing for an overnight camping trip. The most important requirement of the Firecrafter candidacy at camp is Requirement #1. All ranks in the Firecrafter system share this requirement, and it is most important at this step in the program: :Understand and demonstrate the high standards of Firecrafter in personal attitude and example, showing respect for your fellow campers and your environment. Discuss the ideals of Scouting and Firecrafter with your Scoutmaster. In this requirement, the Scoutmaster is given the ultimate and final decision as to whether the young man will be permitted to undertake the Ritual. The Scoutmaster usually makes this decision in consultation with the rest of the Firecrafters in the unit after the Friday evening activities in camp, but this is not required. If the candidate is not successful in meeting the first twelve requirements by the time the unit leaves camp on Saturday morning, the candidacy is terminated and the candidate is not invited to the Firecrafter Ritual. Should the candidate complete his requirements card, and it is properly endorsed by the Firecrafters in his unit and the Consul, the candidate will be invited to the next Ritual for examination and induction and face the Unknown Test. Firecrafter ritual The Ritual is, simply put, a period of testing, a period of reflection, and a period of induction. In keeping with the standards of the Boy Scouts of America, the Ritual is safeguarded and not secret, and there is nothing contained therein that would challenge a young man's ideas or place him in danger or harm. Hazing is not permitted or tolerated during any part of Firecrafter's program. After the creation of the Council Committee in the early 1960s, it has become tradition to hold two rituals every summer; The Mid-Summer Ritual which usually lands in July and the Grand Ritual which is held in mid to late August. The Ritual locations rotate between the six Council camps (Krietenstein, Bear Creek, Belzer, Kikthawenund, Ransburg and Red Wing). A formal rotation is no longer in existence because of the introduction of the Wabash Valley Council, service needs at certain camps, size of camps and scheduling conflicts with other groups. There are some general rules that have developed though. Belzer is the site for the Grand every 5 years on the significant Anniversaries. In the past, Red Wing and Bear Creek have served as primary locations for the Mid- Summer Ritual because they do not interfere with summer camp activities at the camp, though Belzer was the site for the Mid-Summer Ritual in 2010. Should the Council Committee decide to host the Mid-Summer Ritual at one of the operating summer camps, portions of the Ritual are held in a part of camp widely secluded from campers that weekend. The Mid-Summer Ritual is generally the \\"dress run\\" for the larger Grand Ritual in August. Usually less than seventy- five candidates participate in the Mid-Summer Ritual, with the bulk of candidates (sometimes well over a hundred and eighty) participating at the Grand Ritual. Officers are also elected at the Grand Ritual. Adult Alumni Association officers are elected on Friday night at the Alumni meeting, with youth officers elected on Sunday morning at the Council Committee meeting. Organization Being that Firecrafter is a Scouting organization, it follows standard organization of a BSA Council. Troops operate their own Firecrafter programs supplemented by Firecrafters both in their own troop and experienced camp staff members during long-term summer camp. Members are organized at the district level into Embers. Different embers close in location consist of a flame. There are three Flames which comprise the Fire, or Council. Officers of Firecrafter at the Ember, Flame, and Council level comprise the Firecrafter Council Committee, the policy-making body of Firecrafter. Any youth member of the Boy Scouts of America that has earned a camp rank of Firecrafter is a member of the Firecrafter Organization, however, most events that take place are for those who hold the Firecrafter rank. Adult volunteers and professionals above the age of 21 who were not members as youth may become Firecrafters upon nomination by a Firecrafter and become members of the Firecrafter Alumni Association. Those members who were inducted as youth keep their rank upon their 21st birthday and likewise become part of the Alumni Association. However, all members of the Alumni Association are required to pay yearly or life dues; youth members do not pay any form of yearly dues whatsoever. Members generally continue to participate in Firecrafter for their entire lifetime. There are former youth officers that have become adults that serve as officers in the Alumni Association or as advisers to the Council Committee. Justin 'Sox' Scott who was a former youth Council Chief currently serves as the Firecrafter Council Advisor. Identity and traditions Being that Firecrafter is a camp rank organization, many different traditions have been started and continued from generation to generation, and these traditions have contributed to the identity of Firecrafter, making it a unique part of the Scouting experience in Central Indiana. *Firecrafters have a unique signature used for Firecrafter and Scouting business. Any person that holds the rank of Firecrafter is permitted to sign their name with three capital X letters immediately following: John Scout XXX. Further, Minisinos are permitted to sign their name with an underlined M immediately before their name: _M_ John Scout. The signatures are often used on documents relating to Firecrafter only. *Part of the Firecrafter rank requires that the candidate build a fifteen-minute fire. At the conclusion of the fire three holes are burned in the middle of the card at the fire-by-friction requirement for Firecrafter, as an attest to the candidate's completion of the requirement. *The campfire program requirement for Firecrafter entails a grading process at which the candidate's program is critiqued. Three candles are used during this process. If the candidate is successful, the graders will sign the candidate's card and then seal their names with wax. It is also tradition to present the candidate with a wax ball from the three candles used, signifying Friendship, Leadership, and Service. *As part of the induction process, Firecrafter candidates are usually guided to the final step of induction by members of their Scouting unit or members of their own family. It is considered bad taste for a candidate to be guided during this step by a complete stranger if a friend is present at the Ritual. Back of the insignia rounder, signed by fellow Firecrafters *In the earlier years of the organization, the new Firecrafter was presented with a leather backing for his Firecrafter pocket patch called a rounder by his guide at the induction ceremony. Usually made of two pieces of leather laced together with colored lace and a fob for attaching to the right pocket button of the field uniform, the rounder's lace generally identified where the new Firecrafter completed his candidacy. In present-day Firecrafter, the candidate usually either picks the colors of his rounder, it is made for him by a fellow Firecrafter, or his troop wears the same colored rounder. *Still pertaining to the patch rounder, Scouts or Scouters who are close to the new Firecrafter or helped him or her attain the rank are usually expected to sign the back as a sign of welcome and passage into the organization. *As Firecrafter was and is a camp based organization, the different Crossroads camp staffs maintain their own separate identity within the organization and usually compete with each other on a regular basis. Higher ranking Council officers and officer candidates are usually affiliated with a camp staff (or Fire) organization, leading to fierce but healthy competition between the Ransburg, Belzer, Kikthawenund, and Krietenstein Fire organizations. *Members of the various Fires usually gather immediately after the induction ceremony at the Firecrafter Ritual and carry out their own traditions. Normally, these traditions include singing of the camp hymn and various spirit chants. *Adults selected for the Minisino Honor are almost always crowned (officially recognized) immediately following the end of the induction ceremony at the July (Midsummer) or August (Grand) Rituals. It is custom to name the last new adult Minisino of the season as the 'Baby Minisino' and bestow upon them a baby's pacifier for wear at events throughout the year. *There is a Ritual flag that is flown during the inductions weekend, and the senior members of the Ritual staff (Chief Trail Guide, Assistant Chief Trail Guide, and Adult Chief Trail Guide) sign the flag as a mark of their service to Firecrafter. However, this is a more recent tradition dating back to the 1970s or '80s *After Grand Ritual and until the start of Summer Camp the next year is known as the off-season. There are currently three main activities that occur during the off-season: Firecrafter Fall Frenzy, Mid Winter Dinner, and Spring Fellowship. *Once a Firecrafter candidate has completed his fire by friction, it is traditional for any Firecrafters present to sing ‚ÄúMrs. O'Leary's Cow‚Äù (the Chicago Fire song).

His feast day is 21 March. Enda was a warrior-king of Oriel in Ulster, converted by his sister, Saint Fanchea, an abbess. About 484 he established the first Irish monastery at Killeaney on Aran Mor. St Enda is described as the \\"patriarch of Irish monasticism\\". Most of the great Irish saints had some connection with Aran. Early life and conversion According to the Martyrdom of Oengus, Enda was an Irish prince, son of Conall Derg of Oriel (Ergall) in Ulster. Legend has it that when his father died, he succeeded him as king and went off to fight his enemies.Stevens, Rev. Clifford, \\"The One Year Book of Saints\\", Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., Huntington, IN The soldier Enda was converted by his sister, Saint Fanchea, an abbess. He visited Fanchea, who tried to persuade him to lay down his arms. He agreed, if only she would give him a young girl in the convent for a wife. He renounced his dreams of conquest and decided to marry. The girl she promised turned out to have just died, and Fanchea forced him to view the girl's corpse, to teach him that he, too, would face death and judgment.Mann, Benjamin, \\"St. Enda, irish monastic pioneer remembered March 21\\", Catholic News Agency, March 18, 2012 Faced with the reality of death, and by his sister's persuasion, Enda decided to study for the priesthood, and studied first at St Ailbe‚Äôs monastery at Emly.Duffy, Patrick. \\"St. Enda of Aran\\", Caitlicigh Ar An nGreasan Fanchea sent him to Rosnat, a great center of monasticism. There he took monastic vows and was ordained. The stories told of the early life of Saint Enda and his sister are unhistorical. More authentic vitae survive at Tighlaghearny at Inishmore, where he was buried. Drogheda. About 484 he was given land in the Aran Islands by his brother-in-law, Aengus, King of Munster. Three limestone islands make up the Aran Islands: Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer (respectively, the Great, Central and Eastern Island). The three islands of Aran stretch across the mouth of Galway Bay, forming a natural breakwater against the Atlantic Ocean. The largest of the three, Inishmore, is about nine miles long. In many places it is quite barren. Geologically, the islands are an extension of the Burren in Clare, on the mainland to the southeast: an uplifted limestone block, striated by gashes ranging from inches to hundreds of feet deep. Water percolates right through the stone, leading sometimes to water shortages and preventing the formation of the typically boggy western Irish land form. Peat for fires had to be imported from Galway. The resulting flora are unique; Mediterranean and Alpine species meet here, attracting masses of tiny multicoloured butterflies. Enda's monks imitated the asceticism and simplicity of the earliest Egyptian desert hermits. He established the monastery of Enda, which is regarded as the first Irish monastery, at Killeany on Inism√≥r. He also established a monastery in the Boyne valley, and several others across the island, and along with Finnian of Clonard is known as the father of Irish monasticism. At Killeaney the monks lived a hard life of manual labour, prayer, fasting, and study of the Scriptures. The monks of Aran lived alone in their stone cells, slept on the ground, ate together in silence, and survived by farming and fishing. Enda divided the island into two parts, one half assigned to the monastery of Killeany, and the western half to such of his disciples as chose \\"to erect permanent religious houses on the island\\".Healy, John. \\"The Monastic School of Aran\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Jan. 2013 Later he divided the island into 8 parts, in each of which he built a \\"place of refuge\\". The life of Enda and his monks was frugal and austere. The day was divided into fixed periods for prayer, labour, and sacred study. Each community had its own church and its village of stone cells, in which they slept either on the bare ground or on a bundle of straw covered with a rug, but always in the clothes worn by day. They assembled for their daily devotions in the church or oratory of the saint under whose immediate care they were placed. The monks took their meals in silence in a common refectory, from a common kitchen, having no fires in their cloghauns or stone cells, however cold the weather or wild the seas. They invariably carried out the monastic rule of procuring their own food and clothing by the labour of their hands. Some fished around the islands; others cultivated patches of oats or barley in sheltered spots between the rocks. Others ground grain or kneaded the meal into bread, and baked it for the use of the brethren. They spun and wove their own garments from the undyed wool of their own sheep. They could grow no fruit in these storm-swept islands; they drank neither wine nor mead, and they had no flesh meat, except perhaps a little for the sick. St Enda himself died in old age around the year 530. Enda's monastery flourished until Viking times, but much of the stone was ransacked by Cromwell's men in the 1650s for fortifications, so only scattered ruins remain.Denise Fainberg, On Foot In Inishmore, New York Times, August 1, 1999 Most survive as coastal ruined towers. Cattle, goats, and horses now huddle and shiver in the storm under many of the ruins of old walls where once men lived and prayed. These structures were the chosen home of a group of poor and devoted men under Saint Enda. He taught them to love the hard rock, the dripping cave, and the barren earth swept by the western gales. They were \\"men of the caves\\", and \\"also men of the Cross\\". =Enda and St Brecan= Teampall Brecan ‚Äì Inis M√≥r One tale tells that Saint Brecan was not happy with Enda's land division so Enda and Brecan made an agreement. Each say mass at his own monastery on either end of the island, and when they finished they would begin walking towards the centre. Wherever they met, that's where they'd divide the land. But Brecan began saying mass earlier than the agreed time. Enda prayed for divine intervention. Brecan's feet became stuck in the sand at the beach of Kilmurvey, and Enda wound up getting most of the land.\\"A Saint with an Attitude\\", Aran Islands Ireland =Enda and Corban= Corbanus, who was still a heathen, and a churl to boot, vacated the isle, and conveyed his people and their property to the opposite coast. There he met St Enda and his monks preparing to cross in their slender currachs, and seemingly ill provided with food and furniture. There were several sacks and casks of corn and meal on the shore belonging to Corbanus, and as the boats were putting off he joked to the saint, \\"Here are some barrels and sacks of good corn which I would gladly give to save you and these poor men with the shorn heads, from starvation, but your wretched boats could not bear their weight across.\\" \\"Do not mind that,\\" said the saint; \\"let the gift be from your heart‚Äîthat is the main thing.\\" \\"Surely!\\" said the other, \\"I make a free offer!\\" At the word, sacks and barrels, with much bustle, shot forward over the boats and over the men in them, and in a direct line to the eastern landing-place of Inishmore.Kennedy, Patrick. \\"'Aran of the Saints' and its Patron\\", Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts, 1891 Influence on early Gaelic Church During his own lifetime, Enda's monastic settlement on the Aran islands became an important pilgrimage destination, as well as a centre for the evangelisation of surrounding areas. At least two dozen canonised individuals had some association with \\"Aran of the Saints\\". Among these were Saint Brendan the Voyager, who was blessed for his voyage there; Jarlath of Tuam, Finnian of Clonard, and Saint Columba of Iona who called it the \\"Sun of the West\\". Aran became a miniature Mount Athos, with a dozen monasteries scattered over the island, the most famous, Killeany, where Enda himself lived. There, a great tradition of austerity, holiness, and learning was begun. Saint Ciaran of Clonmacnoise came there first as a youth to grind corn, and would have remained there for life but for Enda's insistence that his true work lay elsewhere, reluctant though he was to part with him. When he departed, the monks of Enda lined the shore as he knelt for the last time to receive Enda's blessing, and watched as the boat bore him from them. Saint Finnian left St Enda and founded the monastery of Moville (where Columba spent part of his youth) and who afterwards became bishop of Lucca in Tuscany, Italy. Among those who spent time with Enda was Carthach the Elder. Ciar√°n is said to have walked to Clonmacnoise with his pet cow, which was a particularly good milker; long after her death in great old age the Book of the Dun Cow was bound in her skin.  St Enda's well  Tobar √âinne (Tobar √âanna), Saint Enda's holy well on Inis O√≠rr = Barna, Co. Galway = This holy well is situated on the approach road to Silver Strand close to the village of Barna, Co Galway Galway, about 5 kilometres from Galway city. It is reputed to have been the resting place of St Enda of Aran on his way to the Aran islands. Local tradition has it that St Enda used it to spend the night here on his way to the islands and that one day a well sprung up as he prayed. Through the years pilgrimages were made regularly to the well. = Inis Oirr = Tobar √âinne (or Tobar √âanna) is located near the west coast of Inis O√≠rr.

Aug. 2016 Saint Brendan's stone When Saint Brendan returned from his travels far to the West he thanked God at the Abbey and laid down the only gift he bought back from his travels, a stone with an eye carved on one end and a rune on the other. It was given to him by a dwarf. This stone was said to float if placed on water and the gem pointed to the Last Isle of the West. The rune is a variant of the Norse Reith rune which resembles the letter 'r'. This is called the \\"Styrimathr\\" (STEE-ri-mah-thur) meaning in Norse \\"the Captain of the Seas path\\". It is carried in a small silk purse by the Abbot of the Abbey of St Enda. Those who lived there loved the islands which \\"as a necklace of pearls, God has set upon the bosom of the sea\\", and all the more because they had been the scene of heathen worship. according to a prophecy, \\"there will be left only three islands altogether, when Innish is sent from mortal planes: Inishmore, Inishmaan, and Inisheer.\\" On the largest will stand Saint Enda's well and altar, and the round tower of the church where the bell was sounded which gave the signal that Saint Enda had taken his place at the altar. At the tolling of the bell the service of the Mass began in all the churches of the island.

According to D. M. Dunlop, \\"the name Isaac Sangari is perhaps not attested before the 13th century, when he is mentioned by Nahmanides.\\" Cover of the 1880 Hebrew language Warsaw edition of the Kuzari. Although the rabbi in the Kuzari is not named, the cover makes reference to Yitzhak ha-Sangari. In Sefer ha-Emunot (\\"Book of Beliefs\\"; early 15th century), Rabbi Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov wrote: > I have been preceded by Rabbi Yitzhak ha-Sangeri, companion [haver] to the > king of the Khazars, who converted through that sage a number of years ago > in Turgema [land of Togarmah, i.e. the Turks], as is known from several > books.

The sage Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, the > poet, of Spain, found them and put them into his book, in Arabic, and it has > been translated into our language [Hebrew]... Shem Tov's work was cited by Judah Moscato in his work Kol Yehuda. If the medieval sources are to be believed, Yitzhak was a famous rabbi of the Middle Ages. A learned man, he was versed in Arabic as well as Hebrew and Aramaic. D. M. Dunlop tentatively identified him with the region of Sangaros, in western Anatolia (not far from the ancient site of Troy). Yitzhak's historicity is difficult to determine. A great deal of discussion among scholars has not yet conclusively established when or even if he lived, nor are any details of his ministry among the Khazars given in the Khazar Correspondence or the Schechter Letter. In some Hebrew works he is referred to as Yitzhak al-Mangari. Avraham Firkovich claimed that Yitzhak was a Karaite scholar, and \\"discovered\\" tombstones in Crimea of Yitzhak and his wife. This is unlikely given the esteem in which he was held by Rabbinic authors and the fact that Khazar king's Judaism was almost certainly not Karaite. In any event, the ha-Sangari tombstones were later determined to be forgeries. Among the documents in Firkovich's collections are poems allegedly written by Rabbi Yitzhak. A few Israeli scholars, such as Menashe Goldelman of the Hebrew University, have declared these to be authentic, but their assertions are questioned by other scholars. Yitzhak ha-Sangari appears in the Dictionary of the Khazars novel. See also *Bulan (Khazar) *Khazar Correspondence *Schechter Letter *Serach (Khazar) Sources *Douglas M.

It is built on the former Newbury Wash, which was flat open heathland overlooking Newbury, and until the 19th century there was just a small group of houses separated from Newbury by open country. Both places have grown into each other, and the suburb of Wash Common is now contiguous with Newbury. Most housing development has taken place to the west of the Andover road, and some of the area to the east of the road still remains open farmland. Geography Wash Common is situated at the far western end of a plateau of sand and gravel which forms part of the Bagshot Formation. The plateau runs on an east‚Äìwest axis, and its top originally consisted of boggy heath known as the Newbury Wash. The slope is steepest on the Western side, and to the north it overlooks the Kennet Valley, factors in the First Battle of Newbury. Towards the north west the main road climbs up a gentle incline from Newbury, and continues in a South Easterly direction down a rather steeper slope (once called Trundle Hill, a name no longer used) towards Andover. The level plateau on which it is situated continues for several miles to the east of Wash Common, and a mile to the east can be found the site of the former RAF Greenham Common. History Wash Common is the location of five Bronze Age tumuli. Warren Lodge, part of the St Francis de Sales' Roman Catholic church complex. The manorial rights over the common-field lands known as \\"The Wash\\" were acquired by the Mayor and Corporation of Newbury in 1627. A turnpike road from Oxford to Andover was built across Wash Common and included a gate near the Gun public house, which was in use up to 1880. A milestone still exists where the road slopes down to Hampshire. Meadow near Warren lodge, Wash Common. Until the latter part of the 19th century, Wash Common was open heathland. In 1858 an enclosure resolution was passed; W Money, author of \\"A Popular History of Newbury\\" published in 1905, describes this act in terms of a land grab, (see chapter XVI): \\"it is scarcely necessary to add that the householders of Newbury received no compensation when thus deprived of the valuable rights and privileges which had been enjoyed by the commonality of the town for so many centuries, but their inheritance was bestowed on their more favoured neighbours, whose only claim was that they were already possessed, by purchase or otherwise, of land within the boundaries of the borough\\". The enclosure resolution opened the way for the progressive residential development of Wash Common, which continues to this day. First Battle of Newbury Wash Common covers part of the site of the First Battle of Newbury. The slope which the Parliamentarians captured, east of Skinners Green and including Round Hill, lies just outside the boundary of Wash Common itself. It is still farmland and can be visited by foot. The Royalist artillery was sited near the present day Gun pub, which is now built over. The area where Prince Rupert's cavalry clashed with the Parliamentarians includes the present Wash Common recreation ground but is largely built over [ibid]. Population and administration pollard oak marking part of the ancient parish boundary of Wash Common, part of Newbury, and Sandleford. Wash Common lies within West Berkshire. It forms part of the Falkland Ward, which is represented in Newbury Town Council and West Berkshire Council. It is part of the Newbury parliamentary constituency. The population of Falkland Ward was recorded in the 2001 ONS census as just over 6000, of whom about half live in Wash Common.

Initially built as a high-floor design, In 1996 the low-floor second generation Dennis Dart SLF was launched. In 2001, production of the Dart SLF passed to TransBus International, during which time it was sold as the TransBus Dart SLF; Alexander Dennis took over production in 2004, renaming the product as the Alexander Dennis Dart SLF. More than 11,000 Darts were produced in total during a 19-year production run. Most were purchased by United Kingdom operators, although examples were sold in North America, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. In the United States, the Dart SLF, with Alexander ALX200 bodywork, was built and sold by Thomas Built Buses as the Thomas-Dennis Dart SLF 200. The first generation Dart ceased production in 1998. Production of the Dart SLF continued until 2008, when it was replaced by the Alexander Dennis Enviro200.

It was 2.3m wide and was initially available in the length of 9.0m, but later available in lengths of 8.5m and 9.8m. It was powered by a Cummins 6BT engine and coupled to the Allison AT545 gearbox (the same engine and gearbox were also used in the MCW Metrorider, latterly the Optare MetroRider). This model was sold to London Regional Transport and to some operators outside London. Soon after it was launched, Duple was sold to Plaxton and the Blackpool plant closed. Plaxton decided not to acquire the design rights of the Duple Dartline and it was sold to Carlyle Works, who continued producing the bodywork from 1991. Production passed to Marshall of Cambridge in 1992 who bodied five Darts to this design. In 1993, Marshall updated the design to the C36 and later, the C37. In 1990, Wadham Stringer became the next builder to body the Dart with a body called the Portsdown, but it was sold in small numbers and replaced by the UVG Urbanstar in 1995. In the same year, Wright bodied the Dart with the Handybus. In early 1991, Plaxton launched the Pointer (which was initially designated as Reeve Burgess Pointer as it was built at Reeve Burgess's plant, until later in the same year when it was transferred to Plaxton's Scarborough plant). Later in 1991, East Lancs bodied the Dart with its EL2000. In the latter half of 1991, Alexander launched the Dash. Another contender entering the market at the same time was the Northern Counties Paladin. Initially, it was built with a design of a barrel shaped windscreen with quarterlights (which were mainly sold to Warrington Borough Transport), later models had a deep double-curvature two- piece windscreen. It was phased out when Plaxton bought Northern Counties in 1995. Southampton Citybus Dennis Dart 9SDL Carlyle prototype ‚ÄúEcobus‚Äù in Bitterne in August 1995 In 1993, Southampton Citybus purchased 16 Dart 9SDL buses adapted to use natural gas, the cylinders being mounted in a pod on the roof. As the low-floor single-decker buses became more popular in late 1990s, orders for standard-floor Dart dropped heavily and production ceased in 1998, with the final five delivered to Jersey Motor Transport. A total of 3,470 first generation Darts were produced.Dennis Dart Bus Lists on the Web Second generation (Dart SLF) Carousel Buses Plaxton Pointer 1 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in High Wycombe in July 2009 Stagecoach Grimsby-Cleethorpes 2006 Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Alexander Dennis Dart SLF in Cleethorpes in April 2010 In 1996, Dennis launched a low-floor version of the Dart known as the Dart SLF, with the letters SLF standing for Super Low Floor in reference to the new low- floor design. It was 2.4m wide and initially offered in lengths of 9.2m, 10m and 10.6m, with air suspension introduced in place of the taper leaf used in the original design. The driveline of the step-entrance Dart was retained, although some early examples were fitted with Eaton manual transmission. It was initially offered with the low floor version of the Pointer bodywork (which was notable for being wider), replaced by the updated Pointer 2 in 1997. It was also offered with a wide variety of bodies, namely the East Lancs Spryte, UVG Urbanstar (later renamed as the Caetano Compass; replaced by the Nimbus in 1999), the Wright Crusader, Alexander ALX200 (discontinued in 2001 with the formation of TransBus International and being replaced by the Pointer 2), Marshall Capital (developed from the C37; later built by MCV), Caetano Nimbus and MCV Evolution (since 2005 - a further evolution of the Marshall bodywork). With the move to Euro III emissions in October 2001, the new Cummins ISBe engine was launched, with the 4-cylinder 3.9-litre model being used in all lengths except the 11.3m version, which uses the more powerful 6-cylinder, 5.9-litre version. The Cummins ISBe Euro IV engine became available on the Dart SLF chassis since late 2006. In 2007 the Dennis Dart SLF was superseded by the Alexander Dennis Enviro200. The last Alexander Dennis Dart SLF was delivered to Park Island Transport of Hong Kong in March 2008. A total of 9,191 Dart SLFs were produced, making it one of the most successful buses of all time.Dennis Dart SLF Bus Lists on the Web Cardiff Bus for instance was one operator that took order to many of low floor Dennis Darts and a few high-floor examples (Alexander Dash). These were numbered 23-28 (high-floor), then 301-320, 361-399, 144-199, and 211-244. In 2015, S302 SHB was preserved as one of the first low-floor Darts preserved and goes to many rallies. =Dart SPD= Thamesdown Transport Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SPD in Swindon in October 2005 In 1997, the Dart SPD (short for Super Pointer Dart) was launched with a length of 11.3m (about the same length as a long Leyland National), typically seating 40 to 44 passengers. The Dart SPD was launched to compete with full-size buses such as the Volvo B10BLE and Scania L94UB, while retaining the more lightweight construction of the basic Dart SLF. The Dart SPD has a more powerful engine and a more heavy duty Allison World Series B300R gearbox than the Dart SLF, but also with an option of a Voith gearbox. Originally offered only with Plaxton Pointer 2 bodywork (hence the 'P' in the name), this larger bus was later offered with other bodywork such as the East Lancs Myllennium, the Alexander ALX200 and a few have also been bodied by Marshall. At least 230 Dart SPDs were produced.Dennis Dart SPD Bus Lists on the Web =Dart MPD= Bluebird Bus & Coach Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Alexander Dennis Dart MPD in Manchester in July 2008 In 1998, the Dart MPD (short for Mini Pointer Dart) was launched. At 8.8m long, the Dart MPD was a model reminiscent of the original 8.5m Darts; it was launched to compete with newly emerging shorter midibuses such as the Optare Solo. The Dart MPD typically seated 23 to 29 passengers, and was available in both provincial and London specifications. As with the Dart SPD, the MPD was launched initially with only the Plaxton Pointer 2 bodywork, although other bodies became available later on. =Narrow width Dart SLF= In 2002, TransBus launched a narrower-width variant of the Dart SLF at the request of bus operators in the Channel Islands of Guernsey and then Jersey, who replaced the majority of their fleets with slightly narrower Darts designed to comply with the islands' vehicle size restrictions, sporting adapted versions of existing East Lancs Myllennium and Caetano Nimbus bodies respectively. Further examples have since joined them and small numbers of similar buses have entered service with other operators around the UK. Gibraltar also has a fleet of these narrower buses. The last ones entered service in summer 2007 in Gibraltar. =Thomas-Dennis Dart SLF 200= The Dennis Dart SLF, with Alexander ALX200 bodywork, was constructed in the United States for the North American market by Thomas Built Buses, being sold as the Thomas-Dennis Dart SLF 200 in reference to both the chassis and bodywork.Dennis Dart SLF (USA) Bus Lists on the Web Exports Although primarily sold in the United Kingdom, some were sold overseas: =Australia= ACTION (25),Dennis Dart SLF Specifications ACT Bus Wiki Brisbane Bus Lines (3),Brisbane Bus Lines Australian Bus Fleet Lists Invicta Bus Services (27)Invicta Bus Services Australian Bus Fleet Lists and Transperth (2)Dennis Dart SLF Perth Bus Info =Hong Kong= Park Island Transport Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied TransBus Dart SLF in Kwai Fong in September 2015 In Hong Kong, New World First Bus purchased 76, Kowloon Motor Bus 60, Citybus 30, New Lantao Bus three, Park Island Transport 15 and Discovery Bay Buses five.

January 2, 2010 in S√£o Paulo, Brazil), Italian-Brazilian nuclear physicist and important scientific leader, Emeritus Professor of the Institute of Physics, University of S√£o Paulo. Early life and education Sala graduated in physics in 1943, at the then recently created University of S√£o Paulo, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The Department of Physics of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters was started with two imminent Italian physicists, Gleb Wataghin and Giuseppe Occhialini, who specialized in researching cosmic radiation. He was contemporary with a brilliant generation of young Brazilian physicians, such as C√©sar Lattes, Jos√© Leite Lopes, M√°rio Schenberg, Roberto Salmeron, Marcelo Damy de Souza Santos and Jayme Tiomno. While still a student, Oscar Sala started research work with the group. In 1945, Sala published with Wataghin an important paper on showers of penetrating nuclear particles. Career in academia Soon after graduation, he was hired as a teaching assistant by the Chair of General and Experimental Physics, led by Prof. Marcelo Damy de Souza Santos. His entire scientific and teaching career was spent at the same institution, which later became the Institute of Physics. In this new capacity, Sala became head of the Department of Nuclear Physics (1970‚Äì1979 and 1983‚Äì1987). In 1946 Oscar Sala received a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation and went to study in the U.S., first at the University of Illinois, and subsequently, in 1948, at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. There, he participated in the development of electrostatic particle accelerators for use in nuclear physics research, the first devices to use pulsed beams for the study of nuclear reactions with rapid neutrons. Upon his return to Brazil, Sala was responsible for installing and coordinating research efforts based on a large electrostatic Van de Graaff generator. Later, he helped to build a pelletron at the University of S√£o Paulo (the first in Latin America). As a scientific leader, Dr. Oscar Sala was one of the founders and a scientific director (1959‚Äì1965) with the Foundation for Support of Research of the State of S√£o Paulo (Funda√ß√£o de Amparo √† Pesquisa do Estado de S√£o Paulo (FAPESP) and president of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ci√™ncia). He was a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (Academia Brasileira de Ci√™ncias), the Third World Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Prof. Sala was a member of the Board of Sponsors of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Selected bibliography *WATAGHIN, G. and SALA, O. 1945. Showers of penetrating particles. Phys.

About 800 units were produced with moderate success before the OB-X was discontinued in 1981, replaced by the updated and streamlined OB- Xa. The OB line developed and evolved after that with the OB-8 before being replaced by the Matrix series. The OB-X was used in popular music by Rush (on Moving Pictures and Signals), Nena, Styx member Dennis DeYoung (used frequently from late 1979 to 1984), Queen (their first synthesizer on an album), Madonna for her debut album, Prince, a keen user, and Jean-Michel Jarre who used it for its massive \\"brass\\" sounds. Specification The OB-X was the first Oberheim synthesizer based on a single printed circuit board called a \\"voice card\\" (still using mostly discrete components) rather than the earlier SEM (Synthesizer Expander Module) used in Oberheim semi-modular systems, which had required multiple modules to achieve polyphony. The OB-X's memory held 32 user-programmable presets. The synthesizer's built-in Z-80 microprocessor also automated the tuning process. This made the OB-X less laborious to program, more functional for live performance, and more portable than its ancestors. The \\"X\\" in OB-X originally stood for the number of voice- cards (notes of polyphony) installed. It came in four, six, and eight-voice models with polyphonic portamento, and sample and hold. Even the 4-voice model was expensive at US$4,595. The entire range used \\"paddle\\" levers for pitch and modulation, Oberheim's answer to the \\"wheel\\" controls of the Prophet-5. Though these controls were never as popular as the standard pitch and modulation wheels, the philosophy was to mimic the motion of a guitar player bending the strings on their guitar. On most other synthesizers the pitch bend wheel was on the left, and the modulation wheel to the right of it; on the OB-X Oberheim placed them in the opposite relative positions. In addition to this unique configuration the polarity of the paddles was distinctive; the player would pull back on the pitch lever to bend the pitch sharp, and push forward to bend flat.

When a router receives a packet it normally decides where to forward it based on the destination address in the packet, which is then used to look up an entry in a routing table. However, in some cases, there may be a need to forward the packet based on other criteria. For example, a network administrator might want to forward a packet based on the source address, not the destination address. This permits routing of packets originating from different sources to different networks even when the destinations are the same and can be useful when interconnecting several private networks. Policy-based routing may also be based on the size of the packet, the protocol of the payload, or other information available in a packet header or payload. In the Cisco IOS, PBR is implemented using route maps.Cisco IOS Release 12.0 Quality of Service Solutions Configuration Guide Linux supports multiple routing tables since version 2.2.Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO FreeBSD supports PBR using either IPFW, IPFilter or OpenBSD's PF. Examples PBR can be used to redirect traffic to a proxy server by using a PBR-aware L3-switch (router). In such deployment, specific source traffic (e.g. HTTP, FTP) can be redirected to a cache engine. This is known as virtual inline deployment.

Fire stations frequently contain working and living space for the firefighters and support staff. In large US cities, fire stations are often named for the primary fire companies and apparatus housed there, such as \\"Ladder 49\\". Other fire stations are named based on the district, neighborhood, town or village where they are located, or given a number. Facilities MUTCD sign W11-8 warning of a fire station A fire station will at a minimum have a garage for housing at least one fire engine. There will also be storage space for equipment, though the most important equipment is stored in the vehicle itself. The approaches to a fire station are often posted with warning signs, and there may be a traffic signal to stop or warn traffic when apparatus are leaving or returning to the station. Fire stations have often been built with a tower, for purposes that have changed with time. A drill tower is used for practicing high-rise rescue, while a hose tower is used for hanging hoses to dry to prevent rot. Historically, towers were lookouts for spotting fires. Activities at a fire station include regular inspection and cleaning of the apparatus and equipment, and training drills in which the firefighters practice their skills. Some fire companies also host public activities at the fire station during events such as a \\"fire prevention week\\", and the facility may also be used for fund-raising by the \\"firemen's association\\", \\"fire buffs\\", or \\"fire auxiliary\\". =Occupied stations= If the station is occupied full-time by career firefighters, it will contain living quarters and work areas, where they wait until a callout comes through. Career firefighters are usually able to sleep during a night shift, so these stations will also have dormitories. There will be an alarm system to alert them of an emergency call, and to give some indication of where and what the emergency is. In some small fire departments, the only alarm may be a telephone for receiving calls. Many fire stations were built with the living quarters above the garage. This arrangement is common for fire stations built in a crowded city. The fireman's pole was invented to allow firefighters to quickly descend to the garage. In modern times, agencies such as the National Fire Protection Association have argued that these pose a safety hazard. Modern fire stations are often built with the living quarters on the same level as the garage. =Unoccupied stations= Some fire stations are not regularly occupied, with the firefighting carried out by volunteer or retained firefighters. In this case, the firefighters are summoned to the fire station by siren, radio or pagers, where they will then deploy the fire engine. These fire stations may still have office space for the firefighters, a library of reference and other materials, and a \\"trophy wall\\" or case where the firefighters display memorabilia.

She was sworn in on July 3, 2010, after acting as interim leader following the 2010 April revolution which led to the ousting of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. She previously served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and as head of the parliamentary caucus for the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan. Early life Roza Otunbayeva was born in Osh, Kyrgyz SSR, USSR into the family of Isak Otunbayev, a member of the Supreme Court of Kyrgyz SSR (1967‚Äì1992), and Salika Daniyarova (1925‚Äì2020),https://kaktus.media/doc/416057_ymerla_mat_eks_prezidenta_rozy_otynbaevoy_salika_daniiarova.html a teacher. She graduated from the Philosophy Faculty of Moscow State University in 1972 and went on to teach as Senior Teacher and then as Head of the Philosophy Department at Kyrgyz State National University for six years (1975‚Äì1981). In 1975 she became Candidate of Sciences after defending her dissertation, \\"Critique of falsification of Marxist-Leninist dialectic by the philosophers of Frankfurt school\\". Roza Otunbayeva is a divorced mother of two children. She is fluent in Russian, English, German and French in addition to Kyrgyz. She can also understand a little Chinese. Political career In 1981, she began her political career as the Communist Party's Second Secretary of the Lenin raion council (raikom) of Frunze (now Bishkek). From 1983 to 1986 Ms. Otunbayeva served as the Secretary of the City Communist Party Committee in Frunze (now Bishkek). In 1986 she was appointed the Deputy to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and the same time the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1989 she was appointed as the Executive Secretary and later as the Chairwoman of the USSR UNESCO National Committee, and she also became member of the USSR Foreign Ministry's Board. In 1989‚Äì1992 she served as the Vice-President of the UNESCO Executive Council. By 1992, the now independent Kyrgyzstan was led by Askar Akayev, who chose her to be Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister, positions she held until later that year when she became her country's first ambassador to the US and Canada (1992-1994). In May 1994 she was called back to her original post of Kyrgyz Minister of Foreign Affairs, remaining there for three years. From 1997 to 2002, she served as the first Kyrgyz ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. From 2002 to 2004, she was recruited Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in the Peacekeeping Mission for Georgia. Upon her return to Kyrgyzstan in late 2004, Otunbayeva became politically active. In December 2004, she and three other opposition parliamentarians founded the Ata-Jurt (Fatherland) public movement in preparation for the February 2005 parliamentary elections. From March to September 2005 Ms. Otunbayeva served as Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs. =\\"Tulip Revolution\\"= Otunbayeva was one of the key leaders of the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan which led to the overthrow of President Akayev. Subsequently, she served for a few months as Acting Foreign Minister in the interim government of then prime minister (and acting president) Kurmanbek Bakiyev. After Bakiyev was elected President and Feliks Kulov became Prime Minister, Otunbayeva failed to receive the required parliamentary support to become Foreign Minister. She then ran unsuccessfully in a parliamentary by- election a few months later. Otunbayeva played a key role in the November 2006 protests that pressed successfully for a new democratic constitution. She was the co-chairwoman of the country's Asaba (Flag) National Revival Party for a short time. In December 2007, Otunbayeva was elected to the Jogorku Kenesh - the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan - on the list of the Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan. She served as the Leader of the Opposition SDP from 2008 to 2010. In 2009 she became the Leader of People's Front opposition. =2010 uprising and presidency= On April 7, 2010, Otunbayeva was chosen by opposition leaders as head of the Interim Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, following widespread rioting in Bishkek and the ouster of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Otunbayeva meets Hillary Clinton (2011) Otunbayeva with Vladimir Putin (2010) Bakiyev fled the Jalal-Abad area as the riots became more violent. Unable to rally support, he resigned as president on April 10, 2010, and left the country for Kazakhstan. Nine days later he went to Minsk, Belarus, where he was given protected-exile status. On April 21 he recanted his resignation and declared that he was still president of Kyrgyzstan. Otunbayeva vowed to bring him to trial. As interim president, Otunbayeva had four male deputies. Otunbayeva is considered to be unusual as there are few women in politics in Kyrgyzstan. Her first conversation after she came to power was with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Otunbayeva declared that new elections would be called within six months and that she would act as president until then. With violent protests in support of ousted President Kurmanbek Bakiyev continuing in Jalalabad, the home city of the former president, it was announced on May 19, 2010, by the interim government that elections would be delayed until 2011 and Otunbayeva was named as president. Following a referendum on the new Kyrgyz constitution, she was sworn in on July 3, 2010. Otunbayeva however was prohibited by the new constitution from running in the 2011 presidential election and her term ended on December 31, 2011. The referendum was supported by over 90% and changes the government from a Presidential republic to a Parliamentary republic. Parliamentary elections were held in October and the new parliament elected the Prime Minister and Cabinet.  Post-Presidency  In January 2012 Roza Otunbayeva has established the International Public Foundation \\"Roza Otunbayeva Initiative\\". The main objective of the Foundation is to implement programs and projects that will contribute to the social, political and economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic. During a 2016 speech by her successor at a military parade on Ala-Too Square for the 25th anniversary of Kyrgyzstan's independence, Otunbayeva walked off the stage after President Atamabayev repeatedly criticized her government.https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/independence-day-in-kyrgyzstan- marred-by-tragedy-terror-and-politicking/ During a speech by Otunbayeva at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in May 2018, she claimed that the young Kyrgyz generation values freedom above all, saying that they \\"have been infected by freedom and it runs deep\\".https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers- initiatives/graduate-initiative-russian-studies/girs-news/former-kyrgyz- president  Honours and awards  Roza Otunbayeva was listed as one of the 150 Most Influential Women in the World by Newsweek/Daily Beast 2011 Edition. Otunbayeva has received France's \\"Legion of Honour\\" Award with the degree of Commander, as well as the highest order of Mongolia's \\"Polar Star\\" Award. She was awarded the Premio Minerva Medallion, which is presided over by the President of the Italian Republic, \\"For occupying the highest institutional role in Kyrgyzstan, and for her international activities promoting democracy and peace\\". In 2011, Otunbayeva received an International Women of Courage Award, which is presented annually by the United States Department of State to women around the world who have shown leadership, courage, resourcefulness, and the willingness to sacrifice for others, especially while promoting women's rights. On December 13, 2012, the Eurasia Foundation (USA) awarded her with the 2012 Bill Maynes Award for demonstrating visionary leadership throughout Kyrgyzstan's constitutional transition and providing a lifelong example of public service.

The MGA replaced the MG TF 1500 Midget and represented a complete styling break from MG's earlier sports cars. Announced on 26 September 1955Wide Margin Of Safety In High-Performance Cars. The Times, Tuesday, Sep 27, 1955; pg. 5; Issue 53336 the car was officially launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show. A total of 101,081 units were marketed through the end of production in July 1962, the vast majority of which were exported. 5869 cars were sold on the home market, and the MGA was replaced by the MGB. Design The MGA design dates back to 1951, when MG designer Syd Enever created a streamlined body for George Philips' TD Le Mans car. The new bodywork traded the MG TF's articulated fenders and running board for ponton styling, with a single styled envelope fully enclosing the width and uninterrupted length of a car. The TF featured a high driver seating position. A new chassis was designed with the side members further apart and the floor attached to the bottom rather than the top of the frame sections. A prototype was built and shown to the BMC chairman Leonard Lord. He turned down the idea of producing the new car as he had just signed a deal with Donald Healey to produce Austin-Healey cars two weeks before. Falling sales of the traditional MG models caused a change of heart, and the car, initially to be called the UA-series, was brought back. As it was so different from the older MG models it was called the MGA, the \\"first of a new line\\" to quote the contemporary advertising. There was also a new engine available, therefore the car did not have the originally intended XPAG unit but was fitted with the BMC B-series engine allowing a lower bonnet line. The MGA convertible had no exterior door handles, however the coupe had door handles. It was a body-on-frame design and used the straight-4 \\"B series\\" engine from the MG Magnette saloon driving the rear wheels through a four- speed gearbox. Suspension was independent with coil springs and wishbones at the front and a rigid axle with semi-elliptic springs at the rear. Steering was by rack and pinion. The car was available with either wire-spoked or steel-disc road wheels. 1500 The 1489 cc engine fitted with twin H4 type SU Carburettors produced 68 hp (51 kW) at first, but was soon uprated to 72 hp (54 kW). Lockheed hydraulic drum brakes were used on all wheels. A coup√© version was also produced, bringing the total production of standard MGAs to 58,750. An early open car tested by British magazine The Motor in 1955 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0‚Äì in 16.0 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£844 including taxes. File:'58 MG MGA Roadster (Hudson).JPG1958 MG MGA roadster (North America) File:MG A rot 2.JPG MGA 1500 from rear quarter File:MG MGA Roadster (Orange Julep).jpgMG MGA with pressed steel wheels (North America) Twin-Cam A high-performance Twin-Cam model was added for 1958. It used a high-compression (9.9:1 later 8.3:1) DOHC aluminium cylinder head version of the B-Series engine producing . Due to detonation problems, a low-compression version was introduced later. Four-wheel disc brakes by Dunlop were fitted, along with Dunlop peg drive knock-off steel wheels similar to wheels used on racing Jaguars, unique to the Twin-Cam and \\"DeLuxe\\" MGA 1600 and 1600 MkII roadsters. These wheels and chassis upgrades were used on a small number of the \\"DeLuxe\\" models built after Twin-Cam production came to a halt.Standard Catalog of Imported Cars, p. 436 Aside from the wheels, the only outside identifier was a \\"Twin-Cam\\" logo near the vent aside the bonnet. A careful look at the rear wheel vents would also reveal another feature unique to Twin-Cam and DeLuxe: those four-wheel Dunlop disc brakes mentioned above. Twin-Cam logo next to vent The temperamental engine was notorious for warranty problems during the course of production, and sales dropped quickly. The engine suffered from detonation and burnt oil. Most of the problems with the Twin-Cam engine were rectified with the low-compression version, but by then the damage had been done. The Twin- Cam was dropped in 1960 after 2,111 (2,210 according to some) had been produced. Production ended in April 1960, but had slowed to a trickle long before. An open car was tested by The Motor magazine in 1958 and was found to have a top speed of , acceleration from 0‚Äì in 9.1 seconds and a fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£1,283 including taxes of ¬£428. Oddly, an open MGA Twin Cam (index PMO 326), road tested by The Autocar magazine in its 18 July 1958 edition only recorded a 0-60 time of 13.3secs with the standing quarter mile of 18.6secs. The mean maximum speed was 113.5 mph, with a best of 114.0 mph. 1600 and 1600 De-Luxe In May 1959 the standard cars also received an updated engine, now at 1588 cc producing . At the front disc brakes were fitted, but drums remained in the rear. 31,501 were produced in less than three years. Externally the car is very similar to the 1500 with differences including: amber or white (depending on market) front turn indicators shared with white parking lamps, separate stop/tail and turn lamps in the rear, and 1600 badging on the boot and the cowl. A number of 1600 De Luxe versions were produced with leftover special wheels and four-wheel disc brakes of the departed Twin-Cam, or using complete modified Twin-cam chassis left redundant by the discontinuance of that model. Seventy roadsters and 12 coup√©s were built. A 1600 open car was tested by The Motor in 1959. It had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0‚Äì in 13.3 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£940 including taxes of ¬£277. Mark II and Mark II De-Luxe The engine size was increased again to 1622 cc by increasing the bore from to for the 1961 Mark II MGA. The cylinder head was also revised with larger valves and re-engineered combustion chambers. Horsepower increased to 90 bhp. It also had a higher ratio 4:1 rear axle, which made for more relaxed high-speed driving. An inset grille and Morris Mini tail lamps appearing horizontally below the deck lid were the most obvious visual changes. 8,198 Mark II roadsters and 521 coup√©s were built. Road & Track magazine reviewed the MG A 1600 Mark II in the September 1961 issue and reported an estimated top speed of 105 mph and a 0-60 acceleration of 12.8 seconds.

Competition history The MGA's bodywork was based largely on that of a one-off MG TD specially built by the MG factory at the request of racing privateer George Phillips for the 1951 24 Hours of Le Mans. Later, a new chassis was designed so as to seat the driver lower in the car with even cleaner bodywork resulting in the EX 175 prototype. The later MG prototype EX 182 was very close to the final production MGA and was the car actually raced at Le Mans in 1955. Three MGA prototypes were entered at Le Mans in 1955. Two of the cars finished the race placing 12th and 17th overall, proving the worth of the new car. The third car crashed with serious injuries to the driver, Dick Jacobs. The MGA has been raced extensively in the U.S. since its 1955 introduction and with considerable success. In Sports Car Club of America competition the MGA has won numerous regional and national championships. It has also been a favourite choice of those competing in vintage racing. Kent Prather has been the most successful American MGA driver to date with G Production wins at the SCCA national championships in 1986, 1990, 1995, 2002, 2003, and 2005. Prather and his MGA accomplished this despite the fact that his MGA was often the oldest vehicle competing among several hundred race cars at the SCCA Runoffs. In the United States, the MGA was used in NASCAR from 1960‚Äì63 in the Grand National Series, failing to win a single race. After production ended of the MGA, MG (which at that point was the last foreign automaker in NASCAR) decided not to field another entry in the circuit, which resulted in a de facto monopoly of the NASCAR circuit by Detroit's Big Three. Aside from a brief period in the 1970s when American Motors fielded the AMC Matador in NASCAR competition, not another non-Detroit automaker‚Äîlet alone a non-American automaker‚Äîwould enter NASCAR until 2007, when Toyota entered NASCAR competition with the Camry.

The show added Atlanta based DJs \\"Southside\\" Steve Rickman and \\"Action Plan\\" Tim Andrews when the show resumed in Atlanta, Georgia, during its later runs. Former Atlanta Falcon Bob Whitfield was added to the show during its last run. The show's primary demographic target was men aged 25 to 49. Show historyOrigins= Larry Wachs and Eric Von Haessler met in the late 1980s and early 1990s, while doing radio and engaging in phone conversations in various capacities in New York. They later sent demos of what work they did together to various markets, ultimately landing interest in Los Angeles. The show was a conversational mix of comedy, skits, and talk-radio, which came to form in 1995 on the Los Angeles station KLSX 97.1 FM. However, Wachs and Von Haessler were later fired from KLSX in 1997 after an on-air meltdown over station management interference with the show, to which the station's management thought differently. =Move to Atlanta and the Clear Channel years= In 1998, Wachs and Von Haessler resumed the show on Clear Channel owned Atlanta station WKLS, which was branded as 96 Rock at the time until just after their second firing in 2006. During The Regular Guys' first stint at Clear Channel, the show was voted \\"Most Likely to Be Fined by the FCC\\" in a Creative Loafing (Atlanta) survey. However, Wachs and Von Haessler were never fined by the FCC, in spite of their two firings from Clear Channel. Wachs and Von Haessler were first fired from WKLS on April 9, 2004, at the height of their Arbitron ratings success, when a graphic interview with pornographic film actress Devinn Lane was accidentally aired over a Honda commercial. That interview was intended to be played backwards, dodging FCC censorship, in a bit called \\"backwards smut,\\" when the show returned from that commercial break. The intent was to mock the Federal Communications Commission indecency crackdown at the time, which stemmed from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Their sidekick \\"Southside\\" Steve Rickman was retained by Clear Channel, as he had a different contract. Wachs and Von Haessler were rehired by Clear Channel in early 2005. They returned to the air on March 21, 2005, on sister station WGST 640 AM. However, the news radio format did not fit their narrative style and they returned to 96 Rock in May. This did not include an immediate reunion with Rickman, as he was doing the afternoon drive time slot with Tim \\"Rhodsie\\" Rhodes who previously did the mid-day shift on 96 Rock. Starting around late September 2006, Rickman began making guest appearances on the show on a nearly daily basis. On October 23, 2006, Wachs and Von Haessler were dismissed from Clear Channel for the second time due to a lawsuit by then Viva 105.7 morning DJs Yogi and Panda. Von Haessler's Mad Pundit Radio program, which was broadcast Saturday afternoons on WGST, was also dropped. The suit claimed that Wachs recorded Yogi and Panda, without their knowledge, while having a discussion in separate bathroom stalls. That recording was part of a bit that was played on the show, which Wachs said was approved by station management. In March 2007, the criminal case against Wachs was dismissed by the Fulton County, Georgia district attorney for having no merit. Consequently, Clear Channel agreed to settle Wachs' breach of contract claims against them in an agreement under which terms were not disclosed. Third Run on Cumulus (2008 to 2014) The show returned to Atlanta airwaves on January 28, 2008, on a new rock station Rock 100.5 which is not owned by Clear Channel, but by Cumulus Media. In April 2009, it was announced that the show would also be simulcast on KDBN FM 93.3, a Cumulus station in the Dallas/Fort Worth market. The show was later dropped from the Dallas/Fort Worth station in September 2009, due to a format change. In October 2009, the show was once again simulcast to a second market at Rock 105.5 in Macon, Georgia. Rock 105.5 was at the time owned by Cumulus. In Independence Day 2010, Larry Wachs made a special guest appearance as a clown in Adult Swim's Squidbillies. In January 2011, the show was given a 3-year contract extension keeping the show on the Atlanta airwaves through 2014. Eric Von Haessler was fired from the show on September 30, 2013. Co-host Larry Wachs posted on Twitter saying that he made it clear to fans that this was management's decision and not his.Accessatlanta.com When the show returned to the air after the 2013 holiday break on January 6, 2014, the show‚Äôs content, time-slot, and run-time had shifted slightly. The show, for the remainder of its existence, aired live from 5:30 AM to 9 AM. Before this, the show had always aired from 6 AM to 10 AM. By this time, the show started a retool containing more celebrity interviews and pop culture news, while doing less comedy bits and political talk. Past entertaining bits from \\"TRG 3.0\\", which is considered to be the 2008 to 2013 time-frame, included Homeless Karaoke and Shoot Steve, among other skits, were dropped in favor of celebrity news. The final \\"Regular Guys 4.0\\", in 2014, was geared to have a more positive tone and appeal for the female demographic. Controversy also arose surrounding Southside Steve with circulating rumors of his homosexual affair with radio personality Rhubarb Jones. December 5, 2014, marked the end of the show as Larry Wachs was ‚Äúdumped‚Äù by Rock 100.5 management, as the station decided go in a different direction with the morning show. Tim Andrews, ‚ÄúSouthside‚Äù Steve Rickman, and other members of the show stayed for the station's new morning show. Wachs was replaced by Jason Bailey who spent a year at WZGC before getting let go in the summer of 2014. It is said that Wachs owns The Regular Guys name, so, the new morning show does not carry on under that name.Radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com Fourth Run on Dickey Broadcasting (2017) The show returned to the Atlanta airwaves on July 24, 2017 on 1230am The Fan 2. During this time the show changed its format from becoming a political talk show to a Sports Talk Show. Larry Wachs brought the show back since he owns the trademark to the name and had Former Atlanta Falcon Bob Whitfield as his Co-Host. Brandon Joseph (formerly of Q100) was hired as the shows producer while John Radcliffe served as board operator. Larry also brought his protege Vinny Bucci back to the show as the Director of Fighting, Conflict, and Drama where he covered combat sports and did Man On The Street interviews. The show was taken off the air on November 14, 2017 due to creative differences.

Gun laws in Pakistan allow for the wide ownership of firearms. Only tribal areas of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa permits the ownership of heavy weaponry including the use of rocket-propelled grenades, short, medium, and long-range rockets, anti-aircraft guns, mortars, etc. These heavy weapons may be made in Pakistan. The people of the provinces of Punjab and Sindh view the bearing and use of arms as a constitutional right whereas the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan view it as part of their culture. Pakistan is also known for its indigenous gunsmith tradition. A notable centre of gun manufacturing is the town of Darra Adam Khel, near Peshawar, historically known for its Lee‚ÄìEnfield .303 facsimiles and other Khyber Pass copies. However, the town now produces a broader range of ordnance including AK-47's, mini-Kalashnikovs, and hand-held firearms, including the \\"James Bond\\" pen gun.Palin, Michael. 2005. Himalaya. Weidenfeld Nicolson Illustrated. 288 pages. . Other enduring customs and a strong culture of honor also promote the prevalence and importance of guns. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the Pashtun residents laud performances of strength and toughness, carrying an AK-47 or other gun is a sign of honour and respect. Aerial firing is fairly common on special occasions such as weddings and festivals, despite being illegal. As such, the broader Pakistani social necessity of portable and displayable wealth takes on an intimidating form among male members of provincial society. History Unlike gun politics in the United States which is frequently debated, there is little public debate in Pakistan on gun control. In no particular order, Pakistanis view weapons as important for one or more of these purposes: *Facilitating a natural right of self-defense; *Participating in law enforcement; *Enabling the people to organize a militia system. *Suppressing insurrection Ownership There are an estimated 20 million firearms in public ownership in Pakistan (both legal and illegal), of which 7 million are registered among the country's population of over 220 million. According to the Small Arms Survey 2017, the rate of private gun ownership is 22.3 firearms per 100 people.http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Firearms_holdings/SAS- BP-Military-owned-firearms-annexe.pdf In a comparison of the number of privately owned guns in 230 countries, Pakistan ranks at No.24.http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Firearms_holdings/SAS- BP-Military-owned-firearms-annexe.pdf GunPolicy.org.2011.‚ÄòCalculated Rates ‚Äì Pakistan.‚Äô Historical Population Data ‚Äì USCB International Data Base.Suitland, MD:US Census Bureau Population Division,17 March.

He also further states that gun licensing laws do not require any background checks or safety targeting or written tests. This also includes a lack of tests on mental health or drug usage by the applicant(s). He argues this to be a contrast to Pakistan's current war against militancy. Sadiq also makes mention of private security guards who carry firearms in public, repeating the common concern of them harassing and intimidating ordinary citizens. Another allegation he makes is that many of the rich elite in Pakistan manage to evade gun restrictions and are able to fabricate paper and digital licenses through connections in the government (i.e. friends and relatives). They are also allegedly able to avoid penalties on gun-related offenses, including murder because of the current diyat laws, allowing a wealthy person to pay compensation to a deceased victim's family. Towards the end of the year 2017, Sadiq wrote an open letter to the government to retain its responsibility to protect citizens rather than allow the state to become ‚ÄòRepublic of Private Security Agencies‚Äô. =Licensing= There are restrictions on shotguns in Pakistan. The regulation of firearms in Pakistan is categorised as shot gun license.Newton, George D and Franklin E Zimring.1969.‚ÄòFirearm Licensing: Permissive v Restrictive.‚Äô Firearms & Violence in American Life: A Staff Report submitted to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence.Washington, DC:US Government Printing Office,1 January. (Q22) Pakistani citizens and special category of foreigners can legally own firearms. A licence is required to purchase a firearm. Acquisition of the licence involves the payment of fees, a processing time ranging from a few days to months, and registration of the firearm with local authorities. Two kinds of licences are currently issued: (1) Prohibited bore and (2) Non-Prohibited bore. They are issued by both the Federal government and Provincial governments. The federal government issues both Prohibited bore (which includes fully automatic weapons) and Non- Prohibited bore (which includes semi-automatic and other weapons) licences for all of Pakistan. Provincial government cannot issue Prohibited Bore licences and their licensing jurisdiction is restricted to their particular province. Present laws allow ownership of handguns up to .45 calibre, although previously there existed an upper limit restriction of .38-calibre. All shotguns are allowed. Federal prohibited bore permits for civilian fully automatic weapons are issued by the Ministry of the Interior and are valid throughout Pakistan. In Pakistan, private possession of fully automatic, semi- automatic and handguns (pistols and revolvers) is permitted under licence.Pakistan.1965.‚ÄòPakistan Arms Ordinance.‚Äô Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965 (W.P.

Applicants for a gun owner's license are not required to prove genuine reason to possess a firearm. Third party character references are not required. Where a past history, or likelihood of family violence exists, the law in Pakistan does not stipulate that a gun licence should be denied or revoked. An understanding of firearm safety and the law, tested in a theoretical and/or practical training course is not required for a firearm licence.

(Q2393) The Pakistani military routinely captures and destroy all weapons seized from the Taliban. =Possession= Open carry is considered to be a misdemeanor. A person may keep a firearm at their place of residence (including display on rooftops of private residences), in their vehicle and concealed carry. According to law, open carrying is prohibited without the approval of the Home Ministry, but still practiced in some rural areas. Open carry is practiced without restriction in some rural areas of Khyber-Pukhtunkhwa and Baluchistan. Special permits are also required for carrying firearms during times when local authorities impose restrictions on public gatherings to preempt civil unrest or during protests that are expected to become violent. Target shooting facilities and shooting galleries exist for gun enthusiasts to practice. =Misconceptions about gun carry age requirement= There have been some misconceptions in the recent years about the age requirement but the correct age to acquire a license is 21.

The series included the MG TA, MG TB, MG TC, MG TD, and MG TF Midget models. The last of these models, the TF, was replaced by the MGA. Although the design was similar to contemporary cars of the 1930s, it came to be considered outdated by the 1950s. The TF name was reinstated in 2002 on the mid-engined MG TF sports car. TA Midget The TA Midget replaced the PB in 1936. It was an evolution of the previous car and was wider in its track at and longer in its wheelbase at . The previous advanced overhead-cam inline-four engine was by then not in use by any other production car so it was replaced by the MPJG OHV unit from the Wolseley 10, but with twin SU carburettors, modified camshaft and manifolding. The engine displaced just 1292 cc, with a stroke of and a bore of and power output was 50 hp (40.3 kW) at 4,500 rpm. The four-speed manual gearbox now had synchromesh on the two top ratios and was connected to the engine by a cork-faced clutch running in oil. Unlike the PB, hydraulic brakes were fitted with drums. 1938 TA in competition, Italy 2015 Like the PB, most were two-seat open cars with a steel body on an ash frame. A bench-type seat was fitted with storage space behind. The T-type was capable of reaching almost in standard tune with a 0‚Äì60 mph time of 23.1 seconds. Allan Tomlinson won the 1939 Australian Grand Prix handicap driving an MG TA. 3,003 were made and in 1936 it cost ¬£222 on the home market, the same as the PB. When first introduced the model was known as the T Type and only after the advent of the TB did the TA designation come into use. =Tickford drophead coup√©= From 1938 the car could also be had with a more luxurious Tickford drophead coup√© body by Salmons of Newport Pagnell, and 252 were made. The soft top could be used in three positions, fully open, closed or open just over the seats. Wind-up windows were fitted to the higher topped doors making the car more weathertight and individual bucket seats used in the fully carpeted interior. Complete chassis were fitted with a very basic body at the Abingdon factory and driven to Newport Pagnell to have their coachwork fitted. =Airline fixed head coup√©= TA Airline coup√© Allan Tomlinson won the 1939 Australian Grand Prix driving a TA A closed Airline coup√© made by Carbodies, as fitted to the P type, was also offered but only one or two are thought to have been made. TB Midget The TA was replaced by the TB Midget in May 1939. It had a smaller but more modern XPAG engine as fitted to the Morris Ten Series M, but in a more highly tuned state and like the TA with twin SU carburettors. This 1250 cc straight-four unit featured a slightly less undersquare bore and stroke and had a maximum power output of at 5200 rpm. The oil-immersed clutch was also replaced by a dry-plate type and gear ratios revised. Available as an open two-seater or more luxurious Tickford drophead coup√©, this is the rarest of the T-type cars, as production began just prior to Britain's entry into World War II. Only 379 TBs were made before the MG factory emptied its buildings and switched to making major aircraft components and modifying tanks.MG in WW2 accessed 28 December 2018 { 1939 TB, Gran Premio Nuvolari 2015 1939 Tickford drophead coup√© } TC Midget The TC Midget was the first postwar MG, and was launched in 1945. The TC is quite accurately well known as the (specific) car that caused the Sport Car \\"craze\\" in America. It was quite similar to the pre-war TB, sharing the same pushrod-OHV engine with a slightly higher compression ratio of 7.4:1 giving at 5200 rpm. The makers also provided information for several alternative stages of tuning for \\"specific purposes\\". The XPAG engine is well known for its tunability. The TC engine was a slightly improved version of the XPAG first introduced to MG in the TB. Notable improvement was through the addition of a hydraulically (oil pressure) adjusted timing chain tensioner. All TCs utilized a (single battery) 12 volt electrical system. All TCs came with 19\\" Dunlop wire wheels. Automatic mechanical timing advance was built into the ignition distributor. It was exported to the United States, even though the car was only ever built in right-hand drive. The export version had slightly smaller US specification sealed-beam headlights (7-inch buckets) and twin tail lights, as well as turn signals and chromed front and rear bumpers with over riders. The body was approximately 4 inches (100 mm) wider than the TB measured at the rear of the doors to give more cockpit space. The overall car width remained the same resulting in narrower running boards with two tread strips as opposed to the previous three. The tachometer was directly in front of the driver, while the speedometer/odometer was on the other side of the dash in front of the passenger, a nod to MG's trials history. 10,001 TCs were produced, from September 1945 (chassis number TC0251) to November 1949 (chassis number TC10251), more than any previous MG model. It cost ¬£527 on the home (UK) market in 1947. Fuel consumption was . Its 0‚Äì60 mph time was 22.7 seconds, a respectable performance at the time. A low fuel warning light would glow on the dash to alert the driver. { 1948 TC wearing full weather protection 1948 TC with aero screens in position and windscreen flat TC engine bay } TD Midget The 1950 TD Midget announced in January 1950 combined the TC's drivetrain, a modified hypoid-geared rear axle, the MG Y-type chassis, a familiar T-type style body and independent suspension on front axle using coil springs from the MG Y-type saloon: a 1950 road-test report described as \\"most striking\\" the resulting \\"transformation ... in the comfort of riding\\". The reference cited here was incorrect to infer the entire drive train was lifted from the TC, as along with the new hypoid differential, a completely different transmission was used (albeit also a four-speed). Also lifted from the company's successful 1¬º-litre saloon was the (still highly geared) rack and pinion steering. In addition the TD featured smaller disc type road wheels, a left-hand drive option and standard equipment bumpers and over-riders. The car was also wider with a track of .

For the driver the \\"all-weather protection\\" was good by the standards of the time. For night driving, instrument illumination was \\"effective but not dazzling, by a pale green lighting effect\\". There was still no fuel gauge, but the of tank capacity gave a range between refuelling stops of about 300 miles (480 km) and a green light on the facia flashed a \\"warning\\" when the fuel level was down to about . In 1950 the TD MkII Competition Model was introduced, produced alongside the standard car, with a more highly tuned engine using an 8.1:1 compression ratio giving at 5,500 rpm. The higher compression ratio engine was offered with export markets in mind, and would not have been suitable for the UK, where thanks to the continued operation of wartime fuel restrictions, buyers were still limited to 72 octane \\"pool petrol\\". The TD MkII also featured twin fuel pumps, additional Andrex dampers, and a higher ratio rear-axle. Nearly 30,000 TDs had been produced, including about 1700 Mk II models, when the series ended in 1953 with all but 1656 exported, 23,488 of them to the US alone. The main complaint that US owners had with the MG TD sold in the US was the British 12-volt electrical system, which was hard to service when most US cars were still using 6 volts. Also, they had minor complaints over the lack of water temperature and fuel gauges. But in general in surveys, owners of the Americanised MG TD had more positive remarks than negative.\\"The Owner's Report on the MG.\\" Popular Mechanics, June 1952, pp. 89-92/240.

TF and TF 1500 Midget The TF Midget, launched on 15 October 1953, was a facelifted TD, fitted with the TD Mark II engine, headlights faired into the fenders, a sloping radiator grille concealing a separate radiator, and a new pressurised cooling system along with a simulated external radiator cap. This XPAG engine's compression ratio had been increased to 8.1:1 and extra-large valves with stronger valve springs and larger carburettors increased output to 57.5 bhp at 5,500 rpm. MG TF 1500 showing enamel plate In mid-1954 the engine capacity was increased by 17 per cent to 1466 cc and designated XPEG. The bore was increased to and compression raised to 8.3:1 giving at 5,000 rpm and a 17 per cent increase in torque. The car was designated TF1500, and externally distinguished by a cream background enamel nameplate on both sides of the bonnet, placed just to the rear of the forward bonnet-release buttons. Production ended at chassis number TF10100 on 4 April 1955 after 9,602 TFs had been manufactured, including two prototypes and 3,400 TF1500s. The TF was superseded by the MGA.

During the 1960s, he became famous throughout the country, nicknamed \\"The Voice\\". He raised money for aid during the famines of the 1970s and 1980s and earned the affection of the nation, being awarded a doctorate degree by the University of Addis Ababa and also winning a lifetime achievement award from the Ethiopian Fine Art and Mass Media Prize Trust. In his later years, he suffered from diabetes. He died on April 19, 2009 in Addis Adaba shortly after returning from United States. Tilahun was honoured with a state funeral attended by tens of thousands of his fellow citizens. BiographyEarly life= Tilahun was born to Getee Gurmu and Gessesse Niguse on September 29, 1940 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Later his family moved to Waliso, Oromia region where he raised. As time went by, his interest in music became increasingly clear, although his grandfather urged him to concentrate on his academic studies. The Ras Gobena School principal Shedad (who was from Sudan), encouraged Tilahun's interest in music and urged him to go to Sudan to pursue his music career. Although Tilahun did not go to Sudan, he took Shedad's advice very seriously. When Weyzero Negatwa Kelkai, Eyoel Yohanes and other artists from the Hager Fikir Theatre came to his school to perform, Tilahun took the opportunity to discuss his interest in music with Eyoel. He was told to go to Addis Ababa if he wanted to pursue a career in the field. Tilahun dropped out of school and tried to travel to the capital city to pursue his dream a journey he began on foot without his family's consent. Tilahun traveled fifteen kilometers on foot, he was caught in a small town of Tulu Bolo and stayed overnight with his aunt. The next day, he was forced to return to his grandfather in Woliso. Since his interest in music lay deep in his heart, Tilahun chose not to stay at his grandfather's house in Woliso. After staying only one night at his grandfather‚Äôs house, he again began his journey to Addis Ababa, this time hiding himself in the back of a loaded truck. =Achievements and career= Tilahun at the Washington DC Ethiopian Soccer Tournament in summer 2008 In Addis Ababa, Tilahun was first hired by the Hager Fikir Association, which is now known as Hager Fikir Theater. After a few years at the Hager Fikir Theater, he joined the Imperial Bodyguard Band where he became a leading star singer. During his time with the band, Tilahun ran afoul of the government after the attempted coup d'√©tat of December 1960 by the Imperial Bodyguard. He was arrested and put in prison for a time.Francis Falceto, \\"Tilahoun G√®ss√®ss√®\\", √âthiopiques No 17, Buda musique, booklet, p. 5. Tilahun moved to the National Theater where his success continued. His tenor singing was regarded as the best Ethiopian pop voice of the 1960s. His popularity was such that he appeared three times in front of Emperor Haile Selassie I. During a visit, the Emperor advised him not to abuse his talent. Recordings made by Tilahun during the 1970s and 1980s helped raise large sums of money to aid famine victims. The majority of his recordings were in Amharic, but he did also record in Oromo. In 1975, Tilahun released eponymous LP Tilahun Gessesse, Amha Records served as the label. With Ethio Grooves, Tilahun released Tilahun Gessesse Vol. 1/Vol. 2 in 1992 as cassette release. The third version is released in that year. When collaborating with The Walias, they together worked to re-recording the older version of LPs since 1983 under Misrach Music Group. Tilahun released his debut single \\"Yehagere Shita\\" in 1970, accompanied with 7\\", mono formats and Philp Philips served as the record label. With these formats, Tilahun continued to release singles and EPs, including \\"Tiz Alegn Yetintu\\" (1970), with Mulatu Astatke, \\"Kulun Manqualesh\\", \\"Min Libejegn\\" (1972), \\"Aykedashm Lebe\\" (1974), and \\"Yikir Yibelatchew / Leyito Blaskerew\\" (1974). He received an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Addis Ababa University, in appreciation of his contribution to Ethiopian music. He also received an award for his lifetime achievements from the Ethiopian Fine Art and Mass Media Prize Trust. =Death and funeral= Tilahun died on April 19, 2009 in Addis Ababa as he was being taken to hospital by his wife. He had just returned to Ethiopia from the United States. He had been in poor health for several years due to diabetes. The Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi stated that \\"Tilahun stood out as an artist of great renown with his lifetime contributions to Ethiopia's modern music, which he popularized across the world\\". The Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Abune Paulos said that \\"whoever is said dead is he who leave[s] nothing worthwhile behind. Tilahun left numerous, though secular, legacies behind to survive the mortal body for generations to come\\". As well as the United States Ambassador Donald Yamamoto stated that \\"Ethiopians owe a great deal to the late Tilahun Gessesse, who promoted Ethiopian music across the world\\". A candlelit vigil was held by friends and family in the garden of the National Theatre in Addis Ababa on the night of Wednesday April 22. On Thursday April 23, 2009, a state funeral was held. About one million Ethiopians, including government officials, and entertainers, gathered in Meskel Square, Addis Ababa and heard messages of condolence from the Prime Minister and President Girma Wolde-Giorgis. A funeral mass was held in Holy Trinity Cathedral Church. Messages of condolence from fans all over the world were posted on a memorial website.

He was the founding vocalist and lyricist of the death metal band Cannibal Corpse (from 1988 to 1995), later working as part of Six Feet Under, and has appeared on the Finnish death metal band Torture Killer's second album Swarm!. Barnes designed the original Cannibal Corpse logo, the Six Feet Under logo and also created the artwork for Warpath, released in 1997. CareerEarly career= Barnes had started his extreme metal career at the age of 19. His first band was a death/thrash band called Tirant Sin, which was formed in 1986 in his hometown of Buffalo. Other members of Tirant Sin included Paul Mazurkiewicz (drums), Bob Rusay, Cam V and Joe Morelli (guitars) and Rich Ziegler (bass guitar). In 1986, Barnes left Tirant Sin to join another New York-based death/thrash metal band named Leviathan that recorded the four-track demo \\"Legions of the Undead\\" in 1987, re-released on the 2005 Six Feet Under box set A Decade in the Grave. Tirant Sin recorded three demos, all privately released: \\"Desecration of the Graves\\" in February 1987, \\"Chaotic Destruction\\" in fall 1987 with Dennis John on vocals, and \\"Mutant Supremacy\\" in 1988. Barnes appeared only on the third demo, when he re-joined Tirant Sin in January 1988. =1988‚Äì1995: Cannibal Corpse= Barnes wrote all of the lyrics on the albums Butchered at Birth, Tomb of the Mutilated, and The Bleeding and wrote the lyrics on Eaten Back to Life with the rest of the band helping. When asked in an interview what was his favorite Cannibal Corpse album that he had worked on, he commented, \\"I love them all, I really do. I really enjoyed them all.\\" In the same interview when he was asked about his time with the band, he responded, \\"I look back on it with a lot of fond memories. It was pretty much my starting point ‚Äì it wasn't exactly my starting point, but it was as a professional musician. I think that it really helped bring about a certain style of music, and with that band I really outlined what most people think death metal vocals sound like ‚Äì I'm part of that. I'm really proud of the imagery, and the lyrical stories that I put together on all those albums. We set out to conquer the world though, and I think we did as far as our corner of the world was concerned.\\" Barnes left Cannibal Corpse in 1995 because of personal differences with the rest of the band. His final vocal recordings with the band were for the \\"Created to Kill\\" sessions which were later re- recorded by his replacement George Fisher for the Vile album. The \\"Created to Kill\\" demo featuring Barnes was eventually released as part of the 15 Year Killing Spree box set released in 2003. He was then able to devote his full attention to the band Six Feet Under, which had been his side project since 1993. Barnes has commented that he is \\"very proud of what I've done with them\\". \\"Being booted out of Cannibal Corpse was pretty memorable but in a good way. I didn't feel I was able to write the way I wanted to so it was a good transition for me.\\"Six Feet Under interview with Chris Barnes There was speculation about Barnes returning to Cannibal Corpse, denied by Alex Webster: \\"We have no plans to do anything with Chris Barnes ever again. It's not something any of us are interested in doing.\\" \\"it's nothing against him, but we prefer to move forward rather than live in the past.\\" =1995‚Äìpresent: Six Feet Under= In 2005, Six Feet Under released 13, their sixth full-length album, produced by Barnes. In the same year, Six Feet Under released A Decade in the Grave, a box set highlighting the previous ten years of Six Feet Under. With the success of two death metal bands already under his belt (Cannibal Corpse and Six Feet Under), Barnes joined the Finnish death metal band Torture Killer in fall 2005. At the time, Barnes said he was fully committed to the band, and appeared on the band's second album Swarm!, which was released on February 24, 2006. However, he left the band in January 2008. Six Feet Under released the album Commandment on April 17, 2007, to highly positive views. Barnes has said that Commandment is his favorite album, claiming to have received over 5,000 messages in support. Many fans cite it as their favorite Six Feet Under release since Bringer of Blood in 2003. On November 11, 2008, Six Feet Under released another album, Death Rituals. It saw the band returning to Morrisound Studios in Tampa, Florida, with Chris Carroll producing and mixing by Toby Wright (Slayer, Korn, In Flames, Fear Factory, etc.) and the return of old friend Bill Metoyer, who recorded the band's CD Warpath, who helped out with recording of the drums. The album has thirteen songs including a cover version of M√∂tley Cr√ºe's \\"Bastard\\" and the ambient song \\"Crossroads to Armageddon\\". On January 16, 2009, a message appeared on Six Feet Under's website saying, Just wanted to let all of our fans know that we are currently in the studio working on Graveyard Classics 3. We are about 60% finished with tracking. Everything is going great and we are having a lot of fun laying these new songs down. more info and track listing to come!! In November 2011, Rob Arnold and Matt DeVries posted statements saying they had left Chimaira to play in Six Feet Under full-time. However, in 2012, DeVries moved on to Fear Factory, replacing longtime bass guitarist Byron Stroud. The vacant position was subsequently filled by the ex-Brain Drill 7-string bass guitarist, Jeff Hughell. The band's ninth studio album, Undead, was released on May 22, 2012. It was announced on the same day that Rob Arnold would be replaced by Ola Englund. The band said that Arnold would remain a central writing partner and collaborator on future Six Feet Under releases. Six Feet Under's tenth album Unborn was released on March 19, 2013, and their eleventh record Crypt of the Devil was released May 5, 2015. Social involvementSupport for marijuana law reform= Since leaving Cannibal Corpse after The Bleeding, Barnes slightly shifted his lyrical focus towards more socio-political issues, the most prominent of which was the legalization of marijuana. The album Warpath contains two songs pertaining to marijuana: \\"4:20\\", which praises the effects of the plant and \\"Caged and Disgraced\\" which questions the detention of individuals for marijuana possession. Included in the album's liner notes is the website for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws and it is pointed out that the song \\"4:20\\" (which is 4 minutes and 20 seconds in length) was recorded on April 20 at 4:20 pm, the national day and traditional time for smoking marijuana. Maximum Violence contains the song \\"Victim of the Paranoid\\". which is another examination of marijuana laws, asserting that marijuana users are victims of a system that is too worried about marijuana users and neglects other more pressing issues. Death metal Vocal styles = Barnes' vocal style originally incorporated low-guttural growls as can be heard in \\"Hammer Smashed Face\\", \\"I Cum Blood\\", \\"Post Mortal Ejaculation\\", \\"Pulverized\\", \\"Fucked with a Knife\\" and \\"Stripped, Raped and Strangled\\".  Musical tastes  Barnes is a big fan of metal pioneers Black Sabbath, which is why Cannibal Corpse did a cover of \\"Zero the Hero\\" (one of Barnes' favorite Black Sabbath songs) on the Hammer Smashed Face EP. When asked about George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher, his vocal replacement for Cannibal Corpse, he said, \\"I know George is a good singer, though he wouldn't have been my choice personally. I kind of like it though because he was never able to sing my songs better than me; that's always made me feel proud, that I was able to write songs that couldn't be imitated. I think he does a great job though, and he's a real nice guy.\\" He lists The Grateful Dead and Crazytown as his favorite band on Six Feet Under's official website.  Beliefs  In an interview, Barnes stated that he believes in reincarnation and has also said, \\"I think there are many hints in life, such as familiarity with certain things, that are unexplainable. These are possibly explainable by the idea of having lived before, which is what I think. My dreams seem very real, and I tap into those places.\\" He also stated that he believes everything is a learning experience. \\"We're here for a reason, and we're gifted by life for sure.\\"} \\"Ever since I discovered Edgar Cayce back in the early 90s I've definitely been aware of a lot of things that have been happening in the world and set my eye on things and just been very aware of some of his writings and I recognize that a few of his prophecies have already come true and have opened that world consciousness that will hopefully change those prophecies because that's a possibility. But for the most part the way things have been going it seems that doomsday is pretty close.\\"  Feud with Seth Putnam  There was friction between Barnes and Anal Cunt's former vocalist Seth Putnam. According to Putnam's now-defunct website (due to his death in 2011), Putnam heckled Barnes during a Six Feet Under set, leading to an altercation between the two ending with Six Feet Under's roadies ganging up on Putnam while Barnes fled to his tour bus. Putnam released the song, \\"Chris Barnes Is a Pussy\\" as retaliation to the incident. Despite the feud, Putnam stated that \\"Murdered in the Basement\\" was his favorite song by Six Feet Under.  Personality  \\"I like a well-told story, something that's directed well in a different way, anything, even commercials. It doesn't have to be underground or horror films, lately I've been getting into more horror stuff but I've kind of eased off and been watching different types of films, you know, back into that. I like all sorts of stuff, it just has to be a well-told story, like everything coming from the writers look. I mean, special effects and that type of stuff doesn't impress me that much more subtle effects do, I mean, I know of the editing process and that doesn't really do anything for me, you know, the magic's taken out. I just like a well-written story with something that just looks really direct.\\" \\"I never was one for fashion or trying to impress people. I just wanted to do the best I could and feel good about what I do and be proud of the time that I put into my art and that's how I feel about it. When it stops becoming fun for me and when it starts becoming upsetting to see where it goes is the day that I just put it aside and let my bodies of works speak for me. Hopefully that day doesn't come too soon but we'll see what happens.\\" \\"I think that I'm just a normal guy. I'm not a super hero or a character in a magazine, I'm just a regular person and I think that's the biggest thing. I don't know if that would surprise anybody but I hope that it would kind of give some people some insight. I'm not a monster.\\" \\"I've always been kind of mellow so I think that does surprise people when they speak to me or hang out with me or something, he's not crazy! I just enjoy life, I enjoy doing what I do and I'm not a character in a book or in a movie. So that's it, I'm a real person and I'm here. I think a lot of people have pre-conceived notions of what I'm like because they've read a bunch of crazy lyrics over the years. Those are my thoughts but I don't live that way in everyday life. I think I'd be in jail for 25 years now if I would have.\\" While on the set of Ace Ventura, Barnes admitted to Jim Carrey that the way his neck contorted while doing \\"Fire Marshall Bill\\" (a skit that was done for the sketch comedy series, In Living Color) grossed him out. Carrey responded to the statement with \\"What? This? This grosses you out? All that shit you write and that little thing grosses you out?\\"Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore Discography ;Six Feet Under * Haunted (1995) * Alive and Dead (1996) * Warpath (1997) *Maximum Violence (1999) *Graveyard Classics (2000) *True Carnage (2001) *Bringer of Blood (2003) *Graveyard Classics 2 (2004) *13 (2005) *Commandment (2007) *Death Rituals (2008) *Graveyard Classics 3 (2010) *Undead (2012) *Unborn (2013) *Crypt of the Devil (2015) *Graveyard Classics IV: The Number of the Priest (2016) *Torment (2017) *Unburied (2018) *Nightmares of the Decomposed (2020) ;Cannibal Corpse *Cannibal Corpse demo (1989) *Eaten Back to Life (1990) *Butchered at Birth (1991) *Tomb of the Mutilated (1992) *Hammer Smashed Face EP (1993) *The Bleeding (1994) *Created to Kill (Vile demo) (1995) *15 Year Killing Spree box set (2003) *Centuries of Torment: The First 20 Years video (2008) ;Torture Killer *Swarm!

In addition to the British intervention, Soyinka calls the horseman's own conviction toward suicide into question, posing a problem that throws off the community's balance. Soyinka wrote the play in Cambridge, where he was a fellow at Churchill College during his political exile from Nigeria. He has also written a preface to the play, explaining what he sees as the greatest misconceptions in understanding it. In particular, he says that the play should not be considered as \\"clash of cultures.\\" Rather, the play demonstrates the need for interaction between African and European cultures, as per Soyinka's post-Biafran cultural philosophy. Plot Death and the King's Horseman builds upon the true story on which Soyinka based the play, to focus on the character of Elesin, the King's Horseman of the title. According to Yoruba tradition, the death of the king must be followed by the ritual death of the king's horseman as well as the king's dog and horse, because the horseman's spirit is essential to helping the chief's spirit ascend to the afterlife. Otherwise, the king's spirit will wander the earth and bring harm to the Yoruba people. The first half of the play documents the process of this ritual, with the potent, life-loving figure Elesin living out his final day in celebration before the ritual process begins. At the last minute, the local British colonial ruler, Simon Pilkings, intervenes, the suicide being viewed as barbaric and illegal by the British authorities. In the play, the result for the community is catastrophic, as the breaking of the ritual means the disruption of the cosmic order of the universe and thus the well-being and future of the collectivity is in doubt. The community blames Elesin as much as Pilkings, accusing him of being too attached to the earth to fulfill his spiritual obligations. Events lead to tragedy when Elesin's son, Olunde, who has returned to Nigeria from studying medicine in Europe, takes on the responsibility of his father and commits ritual suicide in his place so as to restore the honour of his family and the order of the universe. Consequently, Elesin kills himself, condemning his soul to a degraded existence in the next world. In addition, the dialogue of the native suggests that this may have been insufficient and that the world is now \\"adrift in the void\\". Another Nigerian playwright, Duro Ladipo, had already written a play in the Yoruba language based on this incident, called Oba waja (\\"The King is Dead\\"). Themes and motifs * Duty * Anti-colonialism is considered a theme by some scholars based on aspects of the text, but Soyinka specifically calls the colonial factors \\"an incident, a catalytic incident merely\\" in the \\"Author's Note\\" prepended to the play. =Yoruba proverbs= Almost every character in Death and the King's Horseman at some point uses a traditional Yoruba proverb. Through his vast knowledge of Yoruba proverbs, Soyinka is able to endow his play with a strong Yoruba sentiment. Characters often employ Yoruba proverbs primarily as a means of bolstering their opinions and persuading others to take their point of view.Richards, David. Death and the King's Horseman and the Masks of Language. Excerpt from: Soyinka, Wole. Death and the King's Horseman: A Norton Critical Edition. New York: Norton & Company, 2003. Pp. 196-207. The Praise-singer gets annoyed with Elesin for his decision to take a new wife and tries to dissuade him: ::Because the man approaches a brand-new bride he forgets the long faithful mother of his children. ::Ariyawo-ko-iyale Similarly, Iyaloja tries to admonish Elesin against his earthly attachments and stay true to the ritual upon which the good of his society depended: ::Eating the awusa nut is not so difficult as drinking water afterwards. ::Ati je asala [awusa] ko to ati mu omi si i. Another common way in which Soyinka uses proverbs is with Elesin. Elesin himself uses several proverbs in order to convince his peers that he is going to comply with their ritual and thus join the ancestors in orun: ::The kite makes for wide spaces and the wind creeps up behind its tail; can the kite say less than thank you, the quicker the better? ::Awodi to'o nre Ibara, efufu ta a n'idi pa o ni Ise kuku ya. ::The elephant trails no tethering-rope; that king is not yet crowned who will peg an elephant. ::Ajanaku kuro ninn 'mo ri nkan firi, bi a ba ri erin ki a ni a ri erin ::The river is never so high that the eyes of a fish are covered. ::Odu ki ikun bo eja l'oju The final way in which proverbs appear in the play is when Iyaloja and the Praise-singer harass Elesin while he is imprisoned for failing to complete his role within the ritual: ::What we have no intention of eating should not be held up to the nose. ::Ohun ti a ki i je a ki ifif run imu ::We said you were the hunter returning home in triumph, a slain buffalo pressing down on his neck; you said wait, I first must turn up this cricket hole with my toes. ::A ki i ru eran erin lori ki a maa f'ese wa ire n'ile ::The river which fills up before our eyes does not sweep us away in its flood. ::Odo ti a t'oju eni kun ki igbe 'ni lo Performances Written in five scenes, it is performed without interruption. Soyinka himself has directed important American productions, in Chicago in 1976 and at Lincoln Center in New York in 1987, but according to Andrew Gumbel, the play \\"has been much more widely admired than performed\\". The British premiere was directed by Phyllida Lloyd at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester in 1990. It starred George Harris and Claire Benedict. The play was performed at London's Royal National Theatre beginning in April 2009, directed by Rufus Norris, with choreography by Javier de Frutos and starring Lucian Msamati.

He planned and commanded the German invasion of Denmark and Norway in 1940, and was commander of German troops during the occupation of Norway from 1940 to 1944. After the war, Falkenhorst was tried by a joint British-Norwegian military tribunal for war crimes. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1946. The sentence was later commuted to twenty years' imprisonment. Falkenhorst was released in 1953 and died in 1968. Career Falkenhorst was born in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) into a noble family with military roots, the Jastrzembski family of Bad K√∂nigsdorff in Upper Silesia. In 1911 he changed this Polish-derived family name to the Germanized Falkenhorst (translated from German: \\"falcon's nest\\"). He joined the army in 1903 and served in World War I in regimental and staff roles, including a stint in Finland. In 1919, after the end of the war, he joined the paramilitary group Freikorps , and later the Reichswehr. On 1 July 1935, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 3rd Army. In 1939 he commanded the XXI Army Corps during the Invasion of Poland. Vidkun Quisling, Head of the SS Heinrich Himmler, Reichskommissar Josef Terboven, and Falkenhorst in Norway, 1941 On 20 February 1940, Hitler informed Falkenhorst that he would be ground commander for the invasion of Norway Operation Weser√ºbung, and gave him until 5 p.m. the same day to come up with a basic plan. With no time to consult military charts or maps, Falkenhorst picked up a Baedeker tourist guidebook of Norway at a stationery store on his way to his hotel room, where he planned the operation from maps he found in it.Kersaudy, Francois, Norway 1940, pp. 45‚Äì47 Hitler approved his plan. The invasion was a success, aside from heavy losses inflicted upon the Kriegsmarine (navy). Allied forces tried to counter the German move, but Falkenhorst's troops drove them out of the country. For his part in the success, he was promoted to Generaloberst (Colonel General). Between December 1940 and December 1944, von Falkenhorst remained commander of all German troops in Norway (Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Norwegen). In December 1942, Falkenhorst made a plan for the invasion of Sweden if necessary (Operation Polarfuchs; \\"Arctic Fox\\") which required 10 German divisions. Falkenhorst thought it would succeed in 10 days.Pierrejean, Claudine and Daniel, Les secrets de l'affaire Raoul Wallenberg (\\"The Secrets of the Raoul Wallenberg Affair\\"), L'Harmattan. Falkenhorst was dismissed from his command on 18 December 1944 and transferred to the F√ºhrerreserve. He did not receive a further assignment. Trial and conviction After the war, Falkenhorst was tried by a joint British-Norwegian military tribunal for violating the rules of war. He had passed on the F√ºhrerbefehl known as the \\"Commando Order\\" which required captured commandos to be shot. The evidence at trial included Falkenhorst's order that commandos, if kept alive for interrogation, should not \\"survive for more than twenty-four hours\\". He distributed the order in 1942, then reminded his subordinates about it in 1943, insisting that the captured commandos be handed over to the SD, the intelligence service of the SS, for execution. The defense argued that Falkenhorst was acting under superior orders. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1946.The Oxford Companion to International Criminal Justice, pp. 964‚Äì965 The sentence was later commuted to twenty years' imprisonment, after a successful appeal by Sven Hedin Sven Hedin's German Diary 1935‚Äì1942, Dublin 1951, ss. 204‚Äì217. Falkenhorst was released from Werl prison on 23 July 1953, due to bad health. In 1968, following a heart attack, he died at Holzminden, West Germany, where his family had settled after fleeing from Lower Silesia.Milestones, Time Magazine, 5 July 1968. He is buried in the Holzminden Cemetery.

It raged in the United States as states mandated physical education systems. SystemsGerman Gymnastics= Started by Johann Guts Muth and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, used large fixed apparatus, vaulting and marching. Jahn felt that physical conditioning was essential for a strong nation. The German system had a \\"militaristic\\" view of fitness, with a very strict, formal style of physical training: Jahn's purpose in promoting what he called the Turnverein movement was to mold the German youth into strong citizens. It was introduced to America by Charles Beck, a German immigrant. Although they were based on the ideas and work of Friedrich Jahn, the American system was less nationalistic. =Swedish Gymnastics= Sometimes called the \\"Swedish Movement Cure,\\" founded by Pehr Henrik Ling, was a health- oriented approach and recognized for inherent medical values. The Swedish \\"light gymnastics\\" used no apparatus, consisting of calisthenics and exercises. It was freer and less rigid than the German system. The Swedish system was made popular in America from the 1880s under Hartvig Nissen and Nils Posse. =Delsarte System of Physical Culture= A French system created by Fran√ßois Delsarte in the 1890s. His system, based on the belief that certain exercises contributed more to poise, grace, beauty and health, and were therefore more beneficial in improving performances in singing, drama and dance, gained popularity in dance and theatre as well as physical education, though in the latter its popularity was limited and short-lived. =Sargent System= Founded by Dudley Allen Sargent in the 1800s, it was a system of gymnastics based on both the German and Swedish systems. Sargent constructed many types of apparatus to be used in his program and also experimented in anthropometric measurements. This eclectic system required a thorough medical examination as a basic preliminary to any physical activity. Outcome There was no winner proclaimed because popularity varied from region to region and as one would gain a strong foothold, another system would grow in popularity. The public would shift with the latest trend. These systems would all but vanish as science and research would reveal the truth in promoters' claims.

Service historyWorld War I= Following shakedown, Rowan, based at Newport, Rhode Island, operated along the Atlantic coast during the fall of 1916, then participated in winter exercises in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. At Norfolk, Virginia, when the United States entered World War I, she patrolled off the mouth of the York River, and then repaired at New York. On 7 May 1917, she departed Boston for Ireland, arriving with Division 7 at Queenstown on the 27th. From then, through the remainder of the war, Rowan conducted antisubmarine patrols and escorted convoys to both British and French ports. On 28 May 1918, she joined two other destroyers in attacking a U-boat; dropped 14 depth charges; and had the satisfaction of watching oil cover the surface in the attack area. Rowan departed Queenstown on 26 December 1918 and reached New York on 8 January 1919. Into the summer, she conducted exercises along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 29 August, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard and was placed in reduced commission.

Prior to this he spent ten years as political editor for the BBC, and he has had many other roles with the broadcaster. Robinson was interested in politics from an early age. He studied philosophy, politics and economics at the University of Oxford, where he was also President of the Oxford University Conservative Association. Starting out in broadcasting at Piccadilly Radio, after a year as President of the Conservative Party youth group, he worked his way up as a producer, eventually becoming deputy editor of Panorama before becoming a political correspondent in 1996. He became the BBC's chief political correspondent in 1999. Between 2002 and 2005, he worked for ITV News as political editor, but then returned to the BBC assuming the same role. Known for his confrontational and provocative approach, Robinson has on several occasions caused a stir with his style of questioning, particularly of national leaders such as George W. Bush. He has presented programmes such as Westminster Live, Weekend Breakfast and Late Night Live on BBC Radio 5 Live, and Newsnight on BBC Two. Early life Robinson was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, on 5 October 1963, to a translator mother and a sales director father. His mother was born in Shanghai, to where her German-Jewish parents fled during the 1930s. His father was of English background. His parents first met at Geneva University in Switzerland, and married three months later. Robinson was interested in political journalism from the age of eight. He was educated at Cheadle Hulme School and University College, Oxford, where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Whilst travelling in Europe in 1982, he survived a car crash in Lille, France, in which the car, a two-door Volkswagen Beetle, exploded; his friends James Nelson and Will Redhead (son of Brian Redhead, an earlier presenter of Today on BBC Radio 4) were killed. Robinson was \\"severely burned\\", spent five weeks in hospital and had to defer his university place. Brian Redhead became Robinson's mentor, and later encouraged his career in political journalism, giving him a copy of Tony Benn's Arguments for Socialism for his birthday. However, Robinson's early political affiliations were to the right. Political activism Robinson was a founder-member of Macclesfield Young Conservatives (YC) and rose through the ranks, becoming Cheshire YC Chairman from 1982 to 1984 and became a key activist in the moderate- controlled North West Area organisation. Philip Pedley, as National YC Chairman, co-opted Robinson onto the YC National Advisory Committee in 1983 and appointed him National Campaign Director of Youth for Multilateral Disarmament. Robinson was elected National Vice Chairman from 1985 to 1987 and succeeded a fellow moderate, Richard Fuller, when Robinson was elected Chairman of the National Young Conservatives on the moderate ticket against strong right-wing opposition (1987‚Äì1988).Nick Robinson 1987 Manifesto for YC chairman. At university he was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1985. Career Early career: 1986‚Äì1996 = Robinson's first position in broadcasting was at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, which he took up while recovering from his injuries. He joined the BBC in 1986 as a production trainee, and later worked extensively as a television and radio producer for a variety of shows including Newsround and Crimewatch. He then became an assistant producer for On the Record, and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended in the run-up to the Scottish local elections. When leaked, this gained attention from the Labour Party, which perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in the run-up to local elections. = Political correspondent: 1996‚Äì2002 = Robinson interviewing alt=Two men in suits, stood on a grassy field in front of a Gothic style building. There is a tree on the left side, and microphone and recording equipment in the foreground on the floor. In 1996 he became a political correspondent, presenting Weekend Breakfast and Late Night Live on BBC Radio 5 Live, and in 1997 he covered the general election for BBC Radio. In October 1999 he became BBC News 24's chief political correspondent, and also presented Westminster Live. In the run-up to the 2001 general election, Robinson started keeping a daily diary of the campaign. Entitled The Campaign Today, it later became Newslog, and continued to be updated until Robinson left the BBC. When he returned in 2005 he began a new blog with the same name. = ITN political editor: 2002‚Äì2005 = Robinson left the BBC in 2002 to join Independent Television News (ITN) as the political editor of ITV News. Tom Bradby, who later succeeded him in the role, described the appointment as \\"bold, imaginative and instantly successful\\". Robinson stayed with ITN for three years, and caused a major stir early in the 2005 general election campaign, when a Labour Party poster was unveiled. The poster claimed the Conservative Party would initiate cuts of ¬£35 billion to public services if elected; Robinson challenged Prime Minister Tony Blair, claiming the poster was misleading, which forced Blair to admit the ¬£35 billion figure was \\"disingenuous\\". Later on in the election campaign, Labour announced that Tony Blair would be making \\"the most important speech of the campaign\\" on immigration, with a specially invited audience. Robinson asked Blair why there were only white people in the audience, and Blair pointed out a single Asian man to disprove Robinson. Later, Robinson stated: \\"We know that the big two parties carefully select audiences to give a particular appearance. Is it a great controversy to point this out? That's informing the audience.\\" On election night, Robinson joined presenters Jonathan Dimbleby and Alastair Stewart to reveal the results with political analysis. =Return to the BBC: 2005‚Äìpresent= Robinson left ITN and was appointed as the BBC political editor in preference to Martha Kearney in August 2005, replacing Andrew Marr. Robinson continued his provocative approach to journalism, and on more than one occasion had run-ins with powerful politicians. During Tony Blair's visit to Israel in 2006 to discuss the Lebanon War, journalists were asked not to bring up the ongoing rift with Gordon Brown. Bradby, then the ITV political editor, asked a question on the subject but was told it was \\"disrespectful\\". Robinson then followed on the same topic, asking a difficult question on the feud between the Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was criticised for distracting from the main issue of the conference, but he argued that \\"I'm paid to ask questions ... particularly at a time when there are incredibly serious allegations ... I react very badly to organised attempts to stop journalists asking questions.\\" Robinson later criticised Blair's announcement of his intention to stand down. He explained how he considered the setup \\"stage management\\", and how no journalists were allowed to ask questions. In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when he was asked if he was in denial about the situation in Iraq (the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was \\"unsettling\\"). Bush replied \\"It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?\\". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him \\"you still hanging around?\\". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference to the fact that it was a hot day, that \\"next time you should cover your bald head\\". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied \\"I didn't know you cared\\", to which Bush responded \\"I don't\\". Robinson described his quip as a \\"fatal error\\" on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat. Robinson continues to keep a political blog on the BBC website. On 5 May 2006, he said that when he heard about Charles Clarke's sacking in the 2006 Cabinet reshuffle, he was \\"naked in bed.\\" He later apologised, saying he was \\"merely trying to add authenticity. That's the naked truth\\". Another post, dated 25 February 2008, criticised MPs defending Michael Martin against allegations of the misuse of expenses, which caused controversy in parliament. As political editor, Robinson worked across the BBC's politics- related programmes, such as Today on BBC Radio 4, The Daily Politics and Newsnight. He has been a member of BBC's election night team. He has also appeared as a guest on other television programmes, including Children in Need, Have I Got News for You and Top Gear. Robinson has made several documentaries. In May 2011, he presented The Street That Cut Everything, where residents of a street in Preston, Lancashire had their council services withdrawn for six weeks as an experiment. In 2014 he presented The Truth About Immigration BBC ‚Äì The Truth About Immigration for BBC Two. For radio, he made The Prime Ministers BBC ‚Äì The Prime Ministers ‚Äì a 16-part biographical series for BBC Radio 4. In advance of the 2015 general election he made a three-part documentary, entitled Can Democracy Work. BBC iPlayer ‚Äì Can Democracy Work It was announced on 9 July 2015 that, beginning that autumn, Robinson would become a presenter on the early morning BBC Radio 4 programme Today, taking over from James Naughtie. On 5 February 2019, Robinson co-hosted the live final of BBC Two's Icons: The Greatest Person of the 20th Century alongside Claudia Winkleman. Robinson hosted the final head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn prior to the 2019 general election. Reports surfaced in February 2020 that Robinson had been approached in connection with a possibly lucrative future role at the upcoming radio station Times Radio, owned by Rupert Murdoch. However he remains at the BBC. Criticism Robinson has been criticised for allegedly reporting with a pro-Conservative bias. Alastair Campbell brought up his history of Conservative affiliations during an interview. Bias was claimed particularly in the coverage of the 2010 general election; a Facebook group entitled \\"Nick Robinson should not be the BBC's political editor\\" was set up in August 2010. In a 2005 interview with David Rowan, the UK editor of Wired News, Robinson insisted \\"that his involvement [with the Conservatives] ceased twenty years ago\\". On 20 October 2010, following a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard that had been waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed the steps of the gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: \\"You should be ashamed of yourself, mate. Shame on you!\\" Robinson replied \\"I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?\\" He wrote in his blog afterwards: \\"I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera\\". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokingly ambiguous \\"letter of apology\\" on the comedy panel show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010. On the 22 May 2013 edition of the BBC News at Six, Robinson relayed the news that the fatal stabbing of an off-duty British soldier in London that afternoon was being treated by the government as a terrorist incident, but attracted criticism after quoting a source describing the perpetrators as being \\"of Muslim appearance\\". The BBC received 43 complaints about Robinson's use of the term, and he issued an apology on his BBC blog the following day. On 11 September 2014, as part of the coverage of the Scottish independence referendum, Robinson had a dispute with Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond. The previous day Robinson had reported that Lloyds Bank and RBS would be moving their registered offices from Scotland to London in the event of a \\"Yes\\" vote. In the exchangeAlex Salmond smackdowns' BBC's Nick Robinson Robinson asked Salmond two questions: the first about the economic impact of RBS moving its headquarters; the second, more general, about why to trust a politician when CEO's of certain companies advised against independence. In his response, Salmond answered both questions over a 5 minute period, then in a 2 minute 14, as Robinson heckled Salmond's answer he raised points about how the BBC had obtained market-sensitive information. A report was shown on all BBC evening news programmes later that day as part of which Robinson stated Salmond had not answered his question but had instead chosen to lay accusations against the BBC despite this part being a minority of the exchange. The full exchange was posted many times on social media. The BBC received complaints from viewers over the implication that Salmond had not answered a question put to him; there was a protest in Glasgow, in which between 1000 and 2000 protestors called for Robinson to be sacked.Scottish independence: Large crowds protest against perceived BBC and Nick Robinson bias, The BBC responded: \\"The BBC considers that the questions were valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines. In November 2014, Robinson was covering the count of the Rochester and Strood by-election. He was seen smiling while posing for a photograph with Jayda Fransen, candidate and deputy leader of the far-right party Britain First. Robinson denied all connections to Fransen, and later stated that he had assumed she was a staff member at the count seeking a \\"selfie\\". It was later reported that Fransen was wearing a prominent badge saying \\"candidate\\" at the time. In October 2019, Robinson was accused by Douglas Murray of entrapping him during the Today programme by raising a headline to an article of his from two years earlier. Personal life Robinson met his wife Pippa, a relationship counsellor, at university and they married in 1991. They have three children: Harry, Will and Alice. He lives in north London, close to Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. He is a lifelong Manchester United fan, and enjoys sailing and the theatre. Robinson is a fan of the rock band Queen; his ringtone of one of their songs interrupted a discussion during Daily Politics in 2014. In early 2015 Robinson underwent surgery to remove a bronchial carcinoid tumour; he returned to work at the BBC on 13 April 2015 as part of coverage for the 2015 general election.\\"BBC's Nick Robinson to have tumour removed\\" .

It was a small and unique design because it was powered by two Hiller 8RJ2B ramjet engines mounted on the rotor blade tips which weigh 13lbs each and deliver an equivalent of 45 h.p. for a total of 90 h.p.\\"H-32.\\" Flight, 21 March 1958, p. 396. Versions of the HJ-1 Hornet were built for the United States Army and the United States Navy in the early 1950s. The Hiller Museum identifies the YH-32A, named the Sally Rand, as the first helicopter gunship. Design and development Hiller Hornet with litter attached in flight, 1951 The Hiller HJ-1 Hornet was an early attempt to build a jet-powered helicopter using ramjets. Before that there had been experiments with the XH-26 Jet Jeep tip rotor pulse jets. The HJ-1 ramjet tipped rotor propels the rotor and the aircraft. Unlike a conventional helicopter, this mechanically simple design avoids the need for a tail rotor. Unfortunately, the tip speeds on helicopter rotor blades are subsonic, and ramjets are inefficient at subsonic speeds due to low compression ratio of the inlets. Therefore, the Hornet suffered from high fuel consumption and poor range. Also, the vehicle suffered from low translational speeds, and the ramjet tips were extremely noisy. In the event of power loss, autorotation was found to be difficult due to the drag from the ramjet nacelles.\\"Tip-Jet Rotor Helicopters.\\" Aerospaceweb.org, 14 September 2003. Retrieved: 30 January 2012. The vehicle exhibited powerful lifting capacity, and there was some hope for military uses, but the high noise, poor range, and high night-time visibility of the ramjet flames failed to attract sales. Operational history The HJ-1 was evaluated by the United States Army as the YH-32, and the United States Navy as the XHOE-1. In 1957 two YH-32s were modified as the YH-32A for trials as armed helicopters. All the fibreglass cockpit fairings were removed and the tail was modified. The tests were successful in proving the viability of the helicopter as a weapons platform, but due to marginal performance, no further conversions or orders were placed. Also, versions were sent to the U.S. Army's DRC to be evaluated in one of their contests involving the research and development of a light weight, air droppable helicopter for air rescue and reconnaissance, and for a portable, easily put together, and fuel efficient 1 man observation and transport copter. It was competing against the Jet Jeep and its pulse jets. Overall the YH-32 won out over the Jet Jeep, but the concept was considered obsolete, and later the program was canceled.

Ancestry In 1705, Thomas Lister, a farmer and maltster, of Bingley, Yorkshire, England, married Hannah, the daughter of a yeoman (an independent small farmer). They joined the Society of Friends, becoming Quakers, as were most of their descendants. They had a son, Joseph, who left Yorkshire in about 1720 to become a tobacconist in Aldersgate Street in the City of London. Joseph's youngest son, christened John, was born in 1737. He was apprenticed to a watchmaker,Isaac Rogers, in 1752, and followed that trade on his own account in Bell Alley, Lombard Street from 1759 to 1766. He then took over his father's tobacco business, but gave it up in 1769 in favour of his father-in- law Stephen Jackson's business as a wine-merchant in Lothbury. John Lister was made a freeman of the Bakers' company in 1760. He married Mary in 1764, and had two daughters within three years; after an interval of nineteen years, in 1786, when he was 49, his wife gave birth to their only son, Joseph Jackson Lister. Adulthood Lister's sketchbook On leaving school in 1800, Joseph Jackson was apprenticed to his father's wine business in Lothbury, which was becoming a thriving and prosperous concern, and in 1804, at the age of 18 he was made a partner. During a visit to the Quaker Ackworth School near Pontefract in 1814, he met Isabella Harris, then aged 22, the daughter of the school superintendent, also called Isabella, a widow with six children. Isabella junior taught reading and writing to the girls of the school for five years, leaving in 1818 to marry Joseph Jackson Lister. She was then 26, and he was 32. After their marriage, they lived for three years at Tokenhouse Yard, where his wine business was carried on, then for four years at Stoke Newington. In 1821 Lister invested in a trading ship commanded by his brother- in-law. They then bought Upton House in 1825, a spacious old Queen Anne style architecture in the United States with fields and gardens at Upton in Essex. Upton was then a country hamlet to the east of London, close to Hainault and Epping Forest, and the Barking marshes, and it was a pleasant country walk along the banks of the Thames into London. Their neighbours were Samuel Gurney, a Lombard Street banker, and his family who lived in Ham House. It was Gurney who had advised Lister to buy Upton House, and the Lister family lived in close contact with the young people growing up at Ham House. Family Their children included Mary, 1820‚Äì94, who married Rickman Godlee, a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1845, John, 1822‚Äì46, Isabella Sophia, 1823‚Äì70, Joseph, 1827‚Äì1912, William Henry, 1828‚Äì59 and Arthur Hugh, 1830‚Äì1908. Joseph studied medicine, becoming a surgeon and achieving fame and a baronetcy - and later a peerage, becoming Lord Lister - for his work in antisepsis. He operated on his sister Isabella in 1867, performing radical surgery to remove an advanced cancerous breast tumour. She lived for three years after the operation. (Rickman John Godlee, surgeon, a grandson of J J Lister, later wrote a biography of his uncle Joseph.) Joseph's guidance of his son, Joseph, was a large factor in his son's outstanding success. Joseph Lister died in 1912 from a brain tumour at the age of 84. A grandson of Joseph Jackson Lister, was also called Joseph Jackson Lister and was a naturalist and taxonomist. Microscopy J. J. Lister was deeply interested in natural history, and realized that the microscopes available in the early 19th century did not provide adequate resolution to reveal the structure of plant cells and animal cells in sufficient detail. He therefore set about to design and construct achromatic lenses of superior performance, combining lenses of crown and flint glasses of different dispersion, in order to cancel chromatic aberration, showing that spherical aberration could be minimised by the correct separation of the lens combinations, which led to the perfection of the optical microscope., He performed this work in his spare time, while fully engaged in his wine business. He began this work in 1824, and by 1826 he had commissioned an improved microscope stand to be made by the instrument-making firm of William Tulley. The stand was made by an employee of Tulley, James Smith, and is preserved in the Wellcome Institute. Smith set up on his own in 1837, later taking on Richard Beck, a nephew of Lister, as an apprentice finally becoming a partner in 1847 when the company was renamed Smith & Beck. Lister published his work in 1830 in a paper entitled \\"On Some Properties in Achromatic Object- Glasses Applicable to the Improvement of the Microscope\\" submitted to the Royal Society, and collaborated with Smith and with Andrew Ross, who had established what was to become one of the finest microscope manufacturers in 1832. Lister's law of aplanatic foci remained the underlying principle of microscopic science. He had a large circle of scientific contacts, including Airy, Herschel and fellow Quaker Dr Thomas Hodgkin, with whom he discussed microscopic observations including those of red blood cells, leading to the identification of 'Hodgkin's disease‚Äô. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1832. His interest continued, writing a paper in 1843, entitled 'On the Limit to Defining Power in Vision with the Unassisted Eye, the Telescope and the Microscope‚Äô. It was never published, but years later it was presented by his son Lord Lister to the Royal Microscopical Society, and seen to have anticipated many of the later discoveries made by Ernst Abbe and others. Old age Lister was deeply affected by the premature death of his son John in 1846, and thereafter appears to have given up his optical investigations. Their youngest, and for a long while only daughter left at home had married in 1858, and for six years Joseph and Isabella had lived alone at Upton. Their son William Henry died in 1859 after a long illness on a ship bound for Australia. His wife Isabella, who had long been in poor health, died in September 1864, aged 72. Joseph's remaining five years were lonely, although three of the children lived nearby with many grandchildren, and he observed that \\"since his own great loss his friends and contemporaries seemed falling like autumn leaves\\". His chief pleasure during his final years was to receive weekly letters from Joseph in Edinburgh, and to watch his son's advance and the progress of his discoveries. He died aged 84 in October 1869 at home at Upton House, and was buried along with Isabella his wife, in the Friends' Burial Ground, Stoke Newington, Middlesex.

The compression technique has been used in both standardized and proprietary designs. TwinVQ in MPEG-4 In the context of the MPEG-4 Audio (MPEG-4 Part 3), TwinVQ is an audio codec optimized for audio coding at ultra low bitrates around 8 kbit/s. TwinVQ is one of the object types defined in MPEG-4 Audio, published as subpart 4 of ISO/IEC 14496-3 (for the first time in 1999 - a.k.a. MPEG-4 Audio version 1). This object type is based on a general audio transform coding scheme which is integrated with the AAC coding frame work, a spectral flattening module, and a weighted interleave vector quantization module. This scheme reportedly has high coding gain for low bit rate and potential robustness against channel errors and packet loss, since it does not use any variable length coding and adaptive bit allocation. It supports bitrate scalability, both by means of layered TwinVQ coding and in combination with the scalable AAC. Note that some commercialized products such as Metasound (Voxware), SoundVQ (Yamaha), and SolidAudio (Hagiwara) are also based on the TwinVQ technology, but the configurations are different from the MPEG-4 TwinVQ. TwinVQ as a proprietary audio format A proprietary audio compression format called TwinVQ was developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) (in NTT's Human Interface Laboratories) and marketed by Yamaha under the name SoundVQ. The NTT also offered a TwinVQ demonstration software for non-commercial purposes - NTT TwinVQ Encoder and TwinVQ Player, encoder API, decoder API and header file format. The filename extension is .vqf. TwinVQ uses Twin vector quantization. The proprietary TwinVQ codec supports constant bit rate encoding at 80, 96, 112, 128, 160 and 192 kbit/s. It was claimed that TwinVQ files are about 30 to 35% smaller than MP3 files of adequate quality. For example, a 96 kbit/s TwinVQ file allegedly has roughly the same quality as a 128 kbit/s MP3 file. The higher quality is achieved at the cost of higher processor usage. Yamaha marketed TwinVQ as an alternative to MP3, but the format never became very popular. This could be attributed to the proprietary nature of the format‚Äîthird party software was scarce and there was no hardware support. Also the encoding was extremely slow and there was not much music available in TwinVQ format. As other MP3 alternatives emerged, TwinVQ quickly became obsolete. The proprietary version of TwinVQ can be also used for speech encoding. Compression technology specifically designed to handle voice compression was published by NTT. The NTT TwinVQ implementation supported sampling frequencies from 8 kHz or 11.025 kHz and bit rate from 8 kbit/s. Software supportOfficial= NTT in Japan once offered on its website a player/encoder for download. This was not as successful as the Yamaha version (see below) and, nowadays, can be found at ReallyRareWares. Yamaha released an English player application called SoundVQ. Several third party players also supported the format including WinAmp (with the appropriate input plugin) and K-J√∂fol (which supported the format natively). =Third-Party Software= The format was reverse-engineered in 2009 by the FFmpeg project and decoding of vqf files is supported by the open- source libavcodec library, which makes it supported in players that utilize the library, such as VLC media player. Some older versions of Nero Burning ROM are able to encode to TwinVQ/VQF. Some CD-Ripping/Converter software also support encoding to .vqf format.

Darning is a sewing technique for repairing holes or worn areas in fabric or knitting using needle and thread alone. It is often done by hand, but it is also possible to darn with a sewing machine. Hand darning employs the darning stitch, a simple running stitch in which the thread is \\"woven\\" in rows along the grain of the fabric, with the stitcher reversing direction at the end of each row, and then filling in the framework thus created, as if weaving. Darning is a traditional method for repairing fabric damage or holes that do not run along a seam, and where patching is impractical or would create discomfort for the wearer, such as on the heel of a sock. Darning also refers to any of several needlework techniques that are worked using darning stitches: *Pattern darning is a type of embroidery that uses parallel rows of straight stitches of different lengths to create a geometric design. *Net darning, also called filet lace, is a 19th-century technique using stitching on a mesh foundation fabric to imitate lace. *Needle weaving is a drawn thread work embroidery technique that involves darning patterns into barelaid warp or weft thread.  Darning cloth  In its simplest form, darning consists of anchoring the thread in the fabric on the edge of the hole and carrying it across the gap. It is then anchored on the other side, usually with a running stitch or two. If enough threads are criss-crossed over the hole, the hole will eventually be covered with a mass of thread. Fine darning, sometimes known as Belgian darning, attempts to make the repair as invisible and neat as possible. Often the hole is cut into a square or darn blends into the fabric. There are many varieties of fine darning. Simple over-and-under weaving of threads can be replaced by various fancy weaves, such as twills, chevrons, etc., achieved by skipping threads in regular patterns. Invisible darning is the epitome of this attempt at restoring the fabric to its original integrity. Threads from the original weaving are unraveled from a hem or seam and used to effect the repair. Invisible darning is appropriate for extremely expensive fabrics and items of apparel. In machine darning, lines of machine running stitch are run back and forth across the hole, then the fabric is rotated and more lines run at right angles. This is a fast way to darn, but it cannot match the effects of fine darning. Darning tools There are special tools for darning socks or stockings: * A darning egg is an egg-shaped tool, made of stone, porcelain, wood, or similar hard material, which is inserted into the toe or heel of the sock to hold it in the proper shape and provide a foundation for repairs. A shell of the tiger cowry Cypraea tigris, a popular ornament in Europe and elsewhere, was also sometimes used as a ready-made darning egg. * A darning mushroom is a mushroom-shaped tool usually made of wood. The sock is stretched over the curved top of the mushroom, and gathered tightly around the stalk to hold it in place for darning. * A darning gourd is a hollow dried gourd with a pronounced neck. The sock can be stretched over the full end of the gourd and held in place around the neck for darning. File:St√´ppelee.jpgDarning egg, early 20th century File:Stopfpilz.jpgDarning mushroom Pattern darning Pattern darning. Pattern darning is a simple and ancient embroidery technique in which contrasting thread is woven in-and-out of the ground fabric using rows of running stitches which reverse direction at the end of each row. The length of the stitches may be varied to produce geometric designs. Traditional embroidery using pattern darning is found in Africa, Japan, Northern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Mexico and Peru. Pattern darning is also used as a filling stitch in blackwork embroidery. Across the world Iran = Rofoogari is an old traditional skill or technique used to fix or repair historic textiles and woven materials and fabrics in Iran. Having an old history in weaving and textile making, the culture of rofoo, or \\"vasleh- Pineh\\" arose among the poor and unwealthy communities. They used patches to cover the damaged parts and go over the space by running stitches and sometimes decorative ones. In some communities due to lack of resources, they repeated the process as they needed, which is why we find very colorful, different patterned vasleh- pineh in galleries and museums. = India = Rafoogari is the name for art of darning in India and neighbouring countries of the subcontinent where this art of healing the cloth is used for emotional and historical reasons too. Though is a social shame associated with wearing restored clothes but this art has been used by highly skilled \\"rafoogars\\" to restore some priceless clothes such as Pashmina shawl, silks, woolen clothes and even fine cotton, etc. Kashmiris are considered the best rafoogars, who have imparted their knowledge to the artists all over India. Rafoogars still exist across India.Rafoogari: Art of darning, Deccan herald, 13 April 2013.

Sarandon won the San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress and Harris won the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor, sharing the win with his role in The Truman Show. Plot Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke Harrison (Ed Harris) are a divorced New York City couple struggling to help their children Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken) be happy with this sudden change of lifestyle. Luke, an attorney, is living with his new girlfriend, Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts), a successful fashion photographer several years his junior.http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2010/10/28/some-of-the-best- fictional-nyu-characters/ Isabel tries hard to make Anna and Ben feel comfortable and happy with her, but Anna repeatedly rejects her overtures while Ben, who is generally kind to Isabel, adds extra complication with his mischievous nature. Isabel behaves with contempt tempered by caution around Jackie, believing she overcompensates for her divorce by spoiling her children. Jackie, a former publisher turned stay-at-home mom, gives Isabel a cold reception, seeing her as an overly ambitious career woman. She also continues to harbor malice towards Luke, as seen in a confrontation about Isabel. After a long string of arguments and hurt feelings involving Isabel, Jackie, and Anna, Luke proposes to Isabel, making her Anna and Ben's soon-to- be official stepmother. This causes even more friction. Jackie is diagnosed with lymphoma, which is discovered to be terminal. She experiences a range of negative emotions, angry at the woman who she feels was responsible for breaking up her family, and angry that after all of the sacrifices she made for her family, she will never see her children grow up. Jackie actively sabotages Isabel's effort to bond with the children even to the point of refusing to allow her to take Anna to see a rock band that she likes and then taking her to the same concert a few weeks later herself. Eventually, Isabel and Anna's relationship improves. They start to bond over painting, when Isabel teaches Anna how to paint trees. Jackie tells Luke and the children about her illness, resulting in Anna storming out. That night, Jackie shows that she can be fun by dancing and singing with Anna and Ben. Jackie and Isabel disagree repeatedly, largely over Isabel's parenting. Ben goes missing on Isabel's watch and Jackie claims that she has never lost him, which she later admits to be untrue. When Anna has problems with a boy she once liked, the two women give opposite advice, causing more tension between Jackie and Isabel. They manage to establish a shaky truce, as they come to terms that Isabel will soon step into the role of a surrogate mother. The two women finally bond when Isabel reveals her admiration of Jackie's maternal instincts, while Jackie in turn praises Isabel's hipness as a means to connect with Anna. Isabel finally lets her guard down when she tells Jackie her biggest fear is that on Anna's wedding day, all Anna will wish for is her mother's presence. Jackie says her own fear is that Anna will forget her. Jackie explains to Isabel that, while Jackie will always have their past, Isabel will have their future. The film ends with the family celebrating Christmas. Jackie, who is bedridden, is visited in her room by Ben and Anna. Individually, Jackie tells her children that though she will die, she will remain with them as long as they remember her. Later that day, Isabel is taking a family portrait of Luke and Jackie with the children. Jackie demonstrates her acceptance of Isabel by inviting her to join them, stating \\"let's get a photo with the whole family\\". Isabel does, and as the closing credits begin, both women are shown happily in a photo side by side.

It has a 45% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 88 reviews, with an average score of 5.33/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Solid work from Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon isn't enough to save Stepmom from a story whose manipulations dilute the effectiveness of a potentially affecting drama\\".

Chris Barnes returns to his role as the foul-mouthed Tanner Boyle; also starring is Jimmy Baio as pitcher Carmen Ronzonni. This film picks up the Bears' career a year after their infamous second-place finish in the North Valley League. However, after winning this year, they are left reeling by the departure of Buttermaker as their coach, Amanda as their pitcher and an injury to goat-turned-hero Timmy Lupus (Quinn Smith). Faced with a chance to play the Houston Toros for a shot at the Japanese champs, they devise a way to get to Houston to play at the famed Astrodome, between games of a Major League Baseball doubleheader. In the process, Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley) reunites with his estranged father (William Devane), who is ultimately recruited to coach them. The Bears, as a whole, have trouble with fielding during practice, but soon become more cohesive and athletic under Coach Leak's guidance. This film is remembered for the scene in which Astros player Bob Watson first says, \\"Let the kids play.\\" Coach Leak then leads the Astrodome crowd in the chant \\"Let them play!\\" when the umpires attempt to call the game prematurely because of time constraints. The crowd at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game also used this chant when the announcement came that the game would end in a tie at the end of the inning if neither team scored.Rogers, Phil. \\"July 9, 2002: All-Star Game ends in 7‚Äì7 tie\\".

When the team arrives in downtown Houston, they book a room at the Concord Hotel. The building is actually the Lancaster Hotel, located off Texas Avenue across from Jones Hall. The scene where Kelly meets with his father for the first time was filmed at the Texas Pipe Bending Company, a real business located at 2500 Galveston Road. (The Park Memorial Church can be seen across the street.) Later in the movie, the Bears stay at the Houston Hilton; the actual hotel is located at 6633 Travis Street in Houston, but the filming location was the Pasadena Hilton in Pasadena, California. The scene where Coach Leak confronts Sy Orlansky about playing the Bears instead of the team from El Paso was filmed at Bayland Park. The Toros practice scenes were filmed on the Sharpstown Little League fields, with extras including girls from area middle schools.

The story was written by Nicholas Briggs and stars Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy. It was recorded between 6-7 March 1999. To coincide with the release of this new Doctor Who range, a CD was given away free with Doctor Who Magazine #279. Titled Talking 'Bout My Regeneration, this documentary considered the history of the show in audio and featured behind the scenes interviews with the cast and production crew. Davison's and Baker's interpretation of their respective regeneration of The Doctor was well received, with each having a distinct voice and considerable character development. Synopsis Gallifrey is in crisis, facing destruction at the hands of an overwhelming enemy. And the Doctor is involved in three different incarnations ‚Äî each caught up in a deadly adventure, scattered across time and space. The web of time is threatened ‚Äî and someone wants the Doctor dead. The three incarnations of the Doctor must join to set time back on the right track ‚Äî but in doing so, will they unleash a still greater threat? Plot Vansell, a member of the Celestial Intervention Agency, arrives on Gallifrey with an urgent message for the President of the Time Lords ‚Äì an invasion fleet threatens the planet and Time Lord technology will not be able to repel them. History has somehow been distorted, and the only clue is the artron energy of a Time Lord in the distortion... the energy belongs to the Doctor. \\\\---- The Seventh Doctor hears the cloister bell tolling within the TARDIS and changes the coordinate setting. A message comes through from the Time Lords but is too garbled for the Doctor to make out its content. He then hears a mysterious sound coming from outside the TARDIS, and exits to investigate. He hears a woman, Elenya, drowning in quicksand and rushes to her rescue. He is waylaid by a cackling hag who says both he and Elenya will die. Arriving at the quicksand, the Doctor wonders why the hag had not tried to save Elenya, and takes her back to the TARDIS. The hag, Ruthley, returns to attend to a crippled old man named Sancroft, her prisoner. Over a communicator, she reports to a commandant who questions her over ion trails he has detected in her sector but she denies knowledge of them. At the TARDIS, the Doctor is not able to enter his ship. He asks Elenya how she arrived on the world. Sensing some familiarity about her he asks if they have met before. Elenya says that she crash landed on the planet. They set out to search for the hag's residence, as another space craft crash lands nearby. Hearing the crash, Sancroft asks Ruthley if the planet's shields are failing, but she then taunts him that no one is coming to his rescue. The Doctor and Elenya see a ship that somehow makes it through the shields. Ruthley is heard communicating with an alien voice on the ship, which informs her that bio-assassin cultures will activate on landing. The Doctor and Elenya desperately dive for cover as a further ship makes a landing nearby. They arrive at its crash site as something alive emerges. Elenya thinks she is looking at a dying creature, but the Doctor believes the opposite ‚Äì it is something being born. Ruthley speaks to a planetary security robot, a Drudger, and commands it to eliminate the Doctor and Elenya, but it tells her that that procedure is not permitted. Ruthley, talking to herself, says that does not matter because all will be dead soon. The Doctor and Elenya come across the robot which commences to do a mind scan which knocks them out. The Doctor awakes to find himself with Sancroft, but Elenya is still unconscious. He is surprised that the Doctor is not afraid of him. The Drudger reports to Ruthley that it has found bio- engineered life forms emerging from the wreck. The robot confronts the life form and commands it to surrender; its reply is to open fire. Ruthley comes to the cell and tells them they cannot escape, as in the distance they hear the Drudgers being destroyed. Ruthley cackles and tells them that \\"they\\" will kill all of them. The Doctor asks if there is anywhere in the house they can all hide, and Sancroft suggests Ruthley's bedroom. Thinking she has done a deal with them, Ruthley approaches the bio-assassins and tells them that infamous Sancroft, First Knight of Velyshaa, is there for ready them to kill. However, the bio-assassins eliminate her so there will be no witnesses. The bio- assassin plays a recorded message ‚Äì Sancroft has been sentenced to death for war crimes against the people of Calfadoria. When the Doctor pleads with the assassin to spare their lives, it tells him that it has no quarrel with anyone but Sancroft. However, there must be no witnesses, and the assassin opens fire... \\\\---- A submarine prepares to attack a British freighter as the TARDIS materialises on board. The Fifth Doctor disembarks searching for some sort of distortion. He hears a voice of Time Lord calling to him to return to the TARDIS because of the \\"destruction of time\\". However, he is unable to get back inside his craft. A woman arrives and tells him that she will take him to her Captain, just as the submarine starts its attack. The submarine crew spot two survivors clinging to a box floating in the debris of the remains of the ship. The Doctor and the woman, Helen, are brought on board and a thrown in a cell. The craft submerges as a British destroyer enters the area. The Doctor demands to see Captain Schweiger with vital information for the Kaiser. The Doctor pretends to be a German spy, telling him that proof of his identity is in an airtight crate now floating in the sea. The Captain is unwilling to retrieve the crate because of the British ships in the area. When returned the cell, the Doctor notices evidence of a time distortion. One of the crew, Schmidt, begins to attack the Doctor and the voice of a Time Lord is heard urging on the attack. On Gallifrey, Vansell is reprimanded for his brutish plan by the President. However, Vansell insists that the Doctor must be stopped, whatever the cost. On the submarine, Helen tends to the Doctor's wounds after his fight as the alarms on the craft go off. A vessel, the Aquitania, the Lusitania or the Mauritania, has been sighted, and the submarine prepares to attack it. Vansell telepathically contacts Schmidt and again tells him to kill the Doctor. He goes to the cell with a pistol, and the Doctor tries to reason with him. The observing Time Lords argue over whether to kill the Doctor but Vansell proceeds to give the order to Schmidt to kill, who then shoots. Schweiger hears the shot and rushes to investigate. The Doctor is still alive, and Helen taking Schmidt's gun shoots and kills the German. The Doctor takes the gun from her, he has only suffered a shoulder wound. He threatens to shoot Schweiger unless he turns the submarine around. Schweiger does not believe the Doctor could shoot him, but Helen takes the gun and displays more determination. Schweiger turns the submarine around and it heads towards the last known position of the TARDIS. The Doctor however is still unable to reunite with his companions inside the TARDIS and realises that the Time Lords wish him to be dead... \\\\---- On Gallifrey, Vansell discovers that a female presence exists inhabiting the vortex at each of the nexus points at which the Doctor has been observed. He has found a further incident involving the Sixth Doctor and the legendary time beast, the Temperon, in the Kurgon system. He pleads with the president for more power, but the President announces that the transduction barriers have been breached and the aliens have landed on Gallifrey. They call themselves the Knights of Velyshaa and have demanded an unconditional surrender... The Sixth Doctor finds himself at some kind of conference on a space ship where a waitress seems very familiar to him. The ship, the Edifice, is investigating a spatial anomaly known as the Kurgon Wonder. However, a particle field quickly surrounds the ship ‚Äì the Doctor identifies it as a shard of time distortion. He hears voice saying \\"help me\\", but is unable to identify the source. With the exception of the Doctor, a waitress named Elly and an android pilot, everyone on board is aged to death by the disruption. The Doctor tells Elly he believes the TARDIS has crashed into the Kurgon Wonder. They are attacked by some kind of monster but the pilot arrives and shoots it. Time distortion begins to make the hull of the ship disintegrate. The Doctor realises that the ship is still heading into the Wonder through momentum. Analysis of the monsters reveals that they are created by accelerated evolution of bacteria and viruses. On Gallifrey, the Knights shoot dead the President, their technology inhibiting any further regenerations. Vansell is also shot but manages to send a final message through the pilot's positronic brain: \\"do not free the Temperon.\\" Elly reveals that she is part of an organisation dedicated to freeing a being they believe is trapped in the Kurgon Wonder. The Doctor deduces from the presences of Temperon particles that the Wonder is in fact the legendary Temperon trapped at the moment of its death. As the pilot is about to relay the Time Lord's message to the Doctor, Elly shoots it. Afterwards, the Doctor finds himself back in the TARDIS at the centre of the Wonder. The Doctor attempts to dematerialise which will also free the Temperon. The Temperon tells the Doctor that he has released the Knights of Velyshaa. As the Doctor is smothered by the Temperon it issues a final warning: \\"Beware the Sirens of Time...\\" \\\\---- The Temperon absorbs the Doctor into itself and continues its warning about the Sirens of Time. Deposited on Gallifrey, he finds himself in the Panopticon alongside his fifth and seventh incarnations, also brought by the Temperon. They enter contact to share their experiences. They realise the girl each of them encountered was in fact the same person. One of the Knights of Velyshaa welcomes Knight Commander Lyena to Gallifrey in the name of Sancroff. They detect Time Lord life signs and force the Doctors to flee. Escaping into the lower parts of Capitol, they start to search for the Temperon. The Sixth and Seventh Doctors observe a Knight out of its armour, its flesh is rotted and diseased. Soon they find the restrained Temperon, but are captured by the Knights. All three Doctors are brought before Lyena who reveals that subjugated Time Lords are being used to revitalise the Knights. She proceeds to reveal what happened next at each of the nexus points. The Seventh Doctor rerouted the planetary shields to repel the bio-assassins and save Sancroff. The Knights one day found him to inspire their plans of conquest. The Fifth Doctor's actions prevented the sinking of the Lusitania. Although the outcome of the First World War was not greatly affected, a common criminal on board the ship who should have died went on to murder Alexander Fleming. Penicillin was never discovered and in 1956 a plague devastated the Earth. This in turn prevented future humans from defeating the Knights of Velyshaa in battle. When the Sixth Doctor freed the Temperon, its destruction allowed the Knights to gain the powers of Time Travel. However, Lyena pleads with the Doctor to return in time and reverse all the changes. It seems that the destruction of the Temperon caused a disease which affected all the Knights. The last remaining TARDIS on Gallifrey is too damaged to allow them to use it. When they suggest they should release the Temperon, Lyena immediately refuses and orders the Doctors be arrested. The Temperon warns the Doctors to beware the Sirens of Time, and to beware Lyena. Grabbing a weapon from a Knight guard, they use it to release the Temperon from its restraints. It tells the Doctors that Elenya, Helen, Ellie and Lyena are all the same, manifestations of the Sirens of Time ‚Äì a race that feeds on the energies of chaos, distortions and disruptions in time. Unable to disrupt directly, they lure others to do so. If the Doctors obey the Sirens' call more than once, they will be forever trapped in their thrall, but Lyena threatens to kill the Fifth Doctor if they disobey her. The Temperon tells the Doctors if they free it, it will go back in time and destroy the Sirens at the beginning of time. However, they realise he cannot destroy the Sirens or he would have already done so. The Temperon admits this, but he could contain them. Renewing her threat to kill the Fifth Doctor, the Sixth Doctor uses his pragmatism to see through the threat and releases the Temperon. Sancroff is killed by a bio-assassin, the Lusitania is destroyed by the German submarine. Vansell's TARDIS arrives on Gallifrey but nothing is out of the ordinary, and he departs. The Doctors arrive at the nexus point where the Seventh Doctor met Elenya for the first time, but ignore her cries for help. They see the hag Ruthley but tell her they were never there. The Doctors then depart, each to try to find their own TARDISes...

Early life Alexander Cochrane Cushing was born on November 28, 1913, in New York City. He was the son of Howard Gardiner Cushing (1869‚Äì1916), a well-known artist who died when Cushing was three years old, and Ethel (n√©e Cochrane) Cushing (1882‚Äì1948), who had poor health most of her life. His older sisters were Olivia Dulaney Cushing (1904‚Äì1908), and Lily Emmet Cushing (1909‚Äì1969), an artist. His older brother, Howard Gardiner Cushing, Jr. (1906‚Äì1979), married Mary Callender Ames (1908‚Äì1982), daughter of Frederick Lothrop Ames, Jr. In 1925, his mother remarried to James Denison Sawyer (1875‚Äì1943), a Wall Street stock broker. As a child, he lived at a home on East 70th Street, in a house designed by his godfather, William Delano. His paternal grandparents were Robert Maynard Cushing (1836‚Äì1907), a wealthy Boston tea merchant who was a son of John Perkins Cushing (1787‚Äì1862), and Olivia (n√©e Dulany) Cushing. His uncle was Grafton Dulaney Cushing. His maternal grandparents were Alexander S. Cochrane (1840‚Äì1919), and Mary Lynde (n√©e Sullivan) Cochrane (1851‚Äì1918). His maternal aunt, Margaret Cochrane, married F. Murray Forbes, a Boston banker. His first cousin, Alexander Cochrane Forbes was married to Irene Helen Robbins, the daughter of Warren Delano Robbins. Due to the early death of his father and his mother's health issues, Cushing spent much of his young life at boarding school, attended the Groton School, graduated from Harvard University in 1936, and then Harvard Law School three years later in 1939. Career Following his graduation from law school, he practiced for three years, working at the U.S. State Department, upon the recommendation of Groton classmate, Stewart Alsop, and briefly at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., where he argued a case before the United States Supreme Court. He left public service and then worked at Davis Polk. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was a member of the first officer training class at Quonset Point. During the War, he served with the Naval Air Transport Service in South America and the Pacific for five years, eventually retiring as a Lieutenant Commander upon the end of the War. After his service, he returned to the practice of law, with Davis Polk in New York City, for nine months following the war. =Squaw Valley= During a ski vacation to Sierra Nevada, Cushing visited Squaw Valley, which is seven miles from the north shore of Lake Tahoe. He decided that its possibilities as a ski resort were great, so he went into partnership to develop it with Wayne Poulsen, a pilot and former champion skier who had purchased much of the valley's land, , in the 1940s from Union Pacific Railroad and first showed it to him. Cushing invested $145,000 of his own money, as well as $275,000 from Laurence Rockefeller and other investors, and founded the Squaw Valley Ski Resort in 1949. Beginning in 1954, Cushing began lobbying the International Olympic Committee to host the eighth Winter Olympics entirely at Squaw Valley. He eventually won his bid, and Squaw Valley hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics, beating out the well established St. Moritz, Switzerland, and Innsbruck, Austria. Due to his efforts, he was on the cover of Time magazine in 1959. Squaw Valley is one of the largest ski areas in the United States and is the second-largest ski area in Lake Tahoe with and the only funitel in the U.S. attracting approximately 600,000 skiers a year. Personal life Cushing was married three times. His first marriage was in 1938 to Justine Bayard Cutting (1918‚Äì2003), the daughter of Dr. Robert Bayard \\"Fulton\\" Cutting (1886‚Äì1967) and Mary Josephine Armory (1887‚Äì1971). Her father was a first cousin of Justine Bayard Cutting Ward (1879‚Äì1975). Her grandfather, Robert Cutting (1852-1934), was the brother of William Bayard Cutting (1850‚Äì1912) and the son of Elise Justine Bayard (1823‚Äì1853), and served as the president of Cooper Union School of Architecture and Engineering and chairman of the Metropolitan Opera Association. Before their divorce in 1965, they had three daughters together:Justine Bayard Cushing, a decorator; Lily Cushing, who married Janek Kunczynski, who founded Lift Engineering; and Alexandra Olivia Cochrane Cushing, who married Philip King Howard, an attorney with Covington & Burling and the son of Rev. John R. Howard, in 1972. Howard is a descendant of Josiah Bartlett, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. His second marriage was to Elizabeth Ogden (n√©e Woodward) Pratt (1907‚Äì1985), the daughter of William Woodward Sr. (1876‚Äì1953) and Elizabeth Ogden \\"Elsie\\" Cryder (1882‚Äì1981), and the sister of William Woodward Jr. (1920‚Äì1955). She was first married to Robert Livingston Stevens, Jr. (1907‚Äì1972). After their divorce in 1935, he married Grace Vanderbilt (d. 1964). Her second marriage was to John Teele Pratt, Jr. (1903‚Äì1969), which lasted until his death in 1969. In 1985, while she was providing legal counsel regarding development land issues at the base of Squaw Valley, he met his third and final wife, Nancy R. Wendt. They married in 1987 and remained married to until his death in 2006. Wendt, who had also spent her third year of law school at Harvard, received her law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1975. Cushing died on August 19, 2006, at his summer home in Newport, Rhode Island. =Descendants= His granddaughter, Charlotte Iris Cushing Howard, married Daniel Robert Osnoss, both graduates of Yale, in 2012. =Honors= In 1999, Cushing was inducted into the Ski Industry Hall of Fame for his lifetime contribution to the sport.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. Page 650. . AKN is characterized by firm pink or flesh-colored hyperpigmented bumps in the skin, which are usually located on the back of the back of the neck. This is mainly because men often cut their hair very low as opposed to women, allowing the hair to prick the occipital scalp thereby causing irritation. Acne keloidalis nuchae most commonly presents itself in individuals aged 13 to 25. The disease is closely related to pseudofolliculitis barbae and both occur frequently in black men in the military, where it is so common that the US Army has developed official protocols for management. Prolonged cases of AKN can cause keloid formation due to chronic irritation from folliculitis. Bacterial folliculitis and acne can mimic the appearance of AKN; however, unlike acne, comedones are not seen with AKN. Treatments for AKN aim to reduce inflammation and prevent infections and scarring. Therapies for AKN may include topical antibiotics, topical or intralesional corticosteroids, and laser hair removal. Recommended modifications to shaving habits include liberal use of shaving cream, avoidance of stretching the skin while shaving, and use of a single-blade razor rather than a razor with multiple blades.

She represented the electoral district of Louis-Saint-Laurent in the House of Commons of Canada from 2006 to 2011 as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. She also served as a minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper serving as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister for La Francophonie. On May 18, 2011, it was announced that she would be appointed to the Senate of Canada following the loss of her Commons seat in the 2011 federal election. She was formally appointed on June 13, 2011.  Political career  More recently a member of the provincial Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec and the federal Conservative Party of Canada, Verner had previously worked as a political staffer in Quebec City in the Robert Bourassa government. Verner has spent almost 20 years in the communications and public service fields. She was a candidate for the Conservatives in the 2004 federal election and finished second with 31% of the vote, the party's best Quebec showing, in a three-way race that was won by the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois's Bernard Cleary. This was contrasted with her victory in a two-way race in 2006. Looking to boost the party's profile in Quebec, and hoping to make Verner a viable candidate in future elections, Conservative leader Stephen Harper took the unusual step of naming Verner to the opposition shadow cabinet even though she was not a Member of Parliament. She served as critic for the Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec and the Minister responsible for La Francophonie, both posts then held by fellow Quebecker Jacques Saada. She was also appointed chair of the Quebec Conservative caucus which at the time was made up of herself and Conservative senators.  Cabinet  Running again in the 2006 election, she was elected with 57.68% of the vote in Louis-Saint- Laurent, defeating Bernard Cleary, and heading a wave of Conservative victories that swept the Quebec City area. On February 6, 2006, she was sworn into Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet as Minister of International Co- operation and Minister for La Francophonie and the Official Languages Act. Her parliamentary secretary is Ted Menzies, who received some criticism for having La Francophonie as his portfolio while he does not speak French. It was subsequently specified that he was appointed parliamentary secretary to Jos√©e Verner for his experience as opposition critic for International Co-operation rather than for La Francophonie.  Senate  After losing her seat in the House of Commons in the 2011 election, Verner was appointed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to the Canadian Senate on May 18, 2011. On January 31, 2017, Verner announced that she would be resigning from the Conservative caucus to sit as a non-affiliated senator. In May 2017, there was speculation that Verner may be selected as the CAQ candidate for a by-election in the Quebec City electoral district of Louis- H√©bert.http://www.journaldequebec.com/2017/05/17/potins-de-louis- hebert#cxrecs_s Although Verner did not run, she did endorse CAQ candidate Genevi√®ve Guilbault for the seat.http://www.journaldequebec.com/2017/09/22/josee-verner-appuie-la- candidate-caquiste-genevieve-guilbault Verner joined the Independent Senators Group caucus in October 2017. On November 4, 2019, she joined the Canadian Senators Group. At the same time, the CSG selected Senator Verner as its interim deputy leader. On February 27, 2020, in an apparent last ditch effort to defend fellow Senator Lynn Beyak - who is the senator from Northwestern Ontario presently suspended from the chamber for posting racist letters directed at Aboriginal peoples - Verner voted along with only senator Robert Black; to further study the matter respecting Beyak and the \\"ethics\\" committee, which would have effectively bought Beyak (71) more time in the Federal Senate.

Heinrici is considered as the premier defensive expert of the Wehrmacht. He was the commander-in-chief of the Army Group Vistula, formed from the remnants of Army Group A and Army Group Center to defend Berlin from the Soviet armies advancing from the Vistula River. Early life and career Heinrici was born in 1886 in East Prussia, the son of a minister of the (Protestant) Evangelical Church in Germany. He came from a long line of East Prussian theologians, including his uncle Georg Heinrici and his grandfather Carl August Heinrici, and remained a devout Lutheran throughout his life. Following graduation from secondary school in 1905, he broke from family tradition and joined the army on 8 March 1905 as a cadet in an infantry division. From 1905 to 1906, Heinrici attended a war school. During World War I, Heinrici fought in the German invasion of Belgium and earned the Iron Cross 2nd Class in September 1914. Heinrici's division was then transferred to the Eastern Front. There, he fought in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes and the Battle of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, receiving the Iron Cross 1st Class in July 1915. In May 1916, Heinrici took part in the Battle of Verdun. Beginning in September 1916, he served in General Staff positions with the XXIV Reserve Corps and the 115th Infantry Division. In March 1917, Heinrici was posted to the German General Staff. In September, he attended a General Staffs officer training course, and later served as a staff officer with VII Corps and the VIII Corps. In February 1918, Heinrici was posted to an infantry division, serving as a staff officer responsible for operations. In this position, he was awarded the Prussian Knight's Cross of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern with Swords in August 1918. Heinrici had two children, Hartmut and Gisela, with his wife Gertrude. He was a devout Protestant who regularly visited the church. His religious faith and refusal to join the Nazi party made him unpopular with the Nazi hierarchy and led to clashes with Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, who scorned him. Because Heinrici's wife Gertrude had a Jewish parent, their children were labeled Mischlinge (partly Jewish) under Nazi racial law. However, Heinrici received a \\"German Blood Certificate\\" from Hitler himself, which validated their supposed \\"Aryan\\" status and protected them from discrimination. World War II During the Battle of France, Heinrici's command was part of General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb's Army Group C. He commanded the XII Army Corps which was part of the 1st Army. Heinrici's forces succeeded in breaking through the Maginot Line south of Saarbr√ºcken on 14 June 1940. In 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, Heinrici served in the 4th Army under G√ºnther von Kluge as the commanding general of the XXXXIII Army Corps during the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, the Battle of Kiev and the Battle of Moscow. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1941. Late in January 1942, Heinrici was given command of the 4th Army. On 24 November 1943 he was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross for his leadership during the Battle of Orsha, during which the 4th Army taking defensive positions near the Orsha region in Belarus, temporarily halted the advance of the Western Front led by General Vasiliy Sokolovsky. During the 4th Army's retreat, it inflicted heavy losses on the advancing Red Army. These successes contributed greatly to Heinrici's reputation as a defensive specialist. Later in 1943 he refused to obey an order to destroy the city of Smolensk by fire before the German army's retreat, and he was temporarily dismissed from his post as commander. Field Marshal G√ºnther von Kluge (left) and Heinrici, mid 1943 In 1944, after the previous successes of the Red Army in Ukraine, Heinrici repeatedly argued for the retreat of Army Group Center and a concomitant shortening of the front line, Hitler rejected these plans at a staff meeting on 20 May 1944. On 4 June Heinrici was relieved of command of the 4th Army, which was later encircled east of Minsk and nearly destroyed during Operation Bagration. In the summer of 1944, after eight months of forced retirement, Heinrici was sent to Hungary and placed in command of the 1st Panzer Army; as well as the Hungarian First Army which was attached to it. He was able to keep the 1st Panzer Army relatively intact as it retreated into Slovakia. Later in 1944 during the Battle of the Dukla Pass, the 1st Panzer Army prevented Soviet forces from linking up with Slovak rebel forces of the concurrent Slovak National Uprising. Heinrici was awarded the Swords to the Oak Leaves of his Knight's Cross on 3 March 1945. =Retreat from the Oder= On 20 March 1945, Adolf Hitler replaced Heinrich Himmler with Heinrici as Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula on the Eastern Front. Indicating that he was ill, Himmler had abandoned his post on 13 March and retired to a sanatorium at Lychen. At this time, Army Group Vistula's front was less than 50 miles from Berlin. Army Group Vistula consisted of two armies: the 3rd Panzer Army led by General Hasso von Manteuffel and the 9th Army led by General Theodor Busse. Heinrici was tasked with preventing a Soviet attack across the Oder River amid shortages of manpower and materiel. Only the terrain itself favoured Heinrici; he dug the 9th Army into three defensive lines atop Seelow Heights, overlooking the sandy, swampy banks of the Oder. Manteuffel's 3rd Panzer Army, which had fewer panzers than the 9th, was similarly positioned in the north to delay a possible flanking strike by Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Byelorussian Front. On 16 April the Battle of the Oder-Neisse began. The Soviets attacked with about 1,500,000 men for what they called the \\"Berlin Offensive Operation\\". During the Battle of Berlin, Heinrici withdrew his troops westward and made no attempt to defend the city. By late April, Heinrici ordered the retreat of his army group across the Oder River. Hitler only became aware of the retreat of Army Group Vistula around 21 April, after a puzzling request by Heinrici, who sought permission to move his headquarters to a new site, which was further west than Berlin. =Dismissal= On 28 April Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht, was riding along the roads north of Berlin when he noticed that troops of the 7th Panzer Division and of the 25th Panzergrenadier Division were marching north, away from Berlin. These troops were part of General Hasso von Manteuffel's 3rd Panzer Army. As one of the two armies which made up Heinrici's Army Group Vistula, it was supposed to be on its way to Berlin. Instead, Heinrici was moving it northward in an attempt to halt the Soviet breakthrough at Neubrandenburg, contrary to orders of Keitel and his deputy, General Alfred Jodl. Keitel located Heinrici on a road near Neubrandenburg, accompanied by Manteuffel. The encounter resulted in a heated confrontation that led to Heinrici's dismissal by 29 April for disobeying orders. Heinrici was replaced by General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control of Army Group Vistula. Student was captured by the British before he could take command. The rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula's coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance. Heinrici was dismissed by Keitel for refusing to save Hitler. He was summoned to Berlin and would have complied had Captain Hellmuth Lang not persuaded him to \\"drive as slowly as you can\\" to Pl√∂n instead, informing him that he would be murdered in Berlin like Rommel (who had been Heinrici's adjutant, and later Lang's commander). Heinrici then gave himself up to British forces on 28 May. Post-war After his capture, Heinrici was held at Island Farm, a British prisoner of war camp at Bridgend, South Wales, where he remained, except for a three-week transfer to a camp in the United States in October 1947, until his release on 19 May 1948.www.specialcamp11.co.uk In the 1950s, he helped create the Operational History (German) Section of the United States Army Center of Military History, established in January 1946 to harness the operational knowledge and experience of German prisoners of war for the United States Army. He was also featured prominently in Cornelius Ryan's 1966 book, The Last Battle. Heinrici died in 1971 in Karlsruhe and was buried with full military honours at the Berg√§cker cemetery in Freiburg im Breisgau. Legacy Despite being married to a half-Jewish (Mischling) woman, Heinrici supported many Nazi nationalistic and fascistic policies including the Lebensraum concept of territorial expansion, but disagreed with many of their racial policies. He was shocked by the anti-Jewish pogroms of Kristallnacht, although this did not lead him to distance himself from the Nazi regime. On the eve of Operation Barbarossa, Heinrici, on receiving the Commissar Order, justified it as easing pressure on the front lines through the exercise of \\"preventive terror\\" in the rear. Heinrici wrote home to his family that the Soviet soldier fought \\"very hard\\", he concluded that Soviet soldiers were \\"a much better soldier than the Frenchman. Extremely tough, devious and deceitful.\\" He repeatedly ignored \\"scorched-earth\\" orders, such as the order to destroy the historically significant city of Smolensk. As a military commander, historians have described him as the premier defensive expert of the Wehrmacht and a genius admired by his peers, although little-known today because he was, in the words of Samuel W. Mitcham, \\"as charismatic as a 20-pound sack of fertilizer\\". In 2014, Heinrici's private letters and diaries were published in the book A German General on the Eastern Front: The Letters and Diaries of Gotthard Heinrici 1941-1942 edited by Johannes H√ºrter. In his writings, Heinrici revealed his growing doubts about Hitler's strategy and his mounting concern as the Wehrmacht was implicated in war crimes and the first actions of the Holocaust.

Wilson acted as Leader of the GLC while Livingstone was not a member. Labour Party activist Wilson was a professional electrician working for London Transport. He joined the Labour Party in Wall End, East Ham, in February 1970, and that October was selected as a local election candidate;Geoff Horn, \\"Crossing the Floor: Reg Prentice and the Crisis of British Social Democracy\\", Manchester University Press, 2013, p. 106. in May 1971 he was elected as a Labour councillor on Newham Borough Council representing Wall End ward.London Borough Council Elections 13 May 1971 , Greater London Council 1971, p. 51. On the left-wing of the party, Wilson frequently proposed resolutions at the local branch. He supported the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in and criticised the 69 Labour MPs who had supported EEC entry as supporting a \\"violently reactionary\\" Conservative government. Wilson was also a delegate to the Newham North East Constituency Labour Party from the Newham Bus Garage branch of the EETPUHilary Wainwright, \\"Labour: a tale of two parties\\", Hogarth Press, 1987, p. 17. in November 1973, when he first proposed a motion of no confidence in the constituency's sitting Labour MP, Reg Prentice. He was provoked by Prentice's criticism of trade unionists who had been leading protests against the Industrial Relations Act 1971, in particular the Pentonville Five. While Prentice continued as the MP, criticism of him by the local party continued. in 1975 Wilson moved a motion inviting Prentice to retire at the next election (such a motion being the established way to deselect a sitting Labour MP). The motion passed by 12 votes to 8 at a meeting of the local party Executive at the end of June 1975,Geoff Horn, \\"Crossing the Floor: Reg Prentice and the Crisis of British Social Democracy\\", Manchester University Press, 2013, p. 96. and was subsequently ratified by a meeting of the entire local party. Prentice eventually defected to the Conservatives.

With Livingstone no longer a councillor for the period of the byelection, the council administration was transferred to the Policy Committee of which Wilson was the most senior member, and he was designated as the interim council leader. The Conservatives on the council refused to recognise his authority, but his name was quickly added to the list of GLC Leaders engraved outside the council chamber.

Roxann Dawson served as director for the episode. As one of the most significant of the first-season episodes, the events of \\"The Andorian Incident\\" would continue to resonate into the third and fourth seasons. This would, in particular, affect T'Pol and her family. Captain Archer and Commander Tucker, after finding the Vulcan star maps incomplete, talk Sub-Commander T'Pol into taking a trip to P'Jem, a Vulcan monastery. When they arrive there, they find the monastery has unwelcome guests: the Andorians. Plot Captain Archer tells Sub-Commander T'Pol that he had found a remote outpost on a planet a few light years off their current heading, and that he would like to visit this 3000-year-old Vulcan monastery, called P'Jem. En route, T'Pol describes it as an ancient retreat, a place for kolinahr and peaceful meditation. She also explains the strict visit protocols‚Äîthey should not speak to anyone unless spoken to first, nor touch any relics. Arriving at P'Jem, a Vulcan elder tries to send the away team away, but Archer notices the reflected form of an armed intruder. Although they manage to subdue him, they are quickly captured by a larger group of armed Andorian Imperial Guards, led by Commander Shran. Shran interrogates Archer, asking if they have brought more surveillance equipment for the Vulcans. The Andorians lock up the away team with the Vulcan monks, who explain that the Andorians, neighbors of Vulcan, believe that P'Jem holds a long-range sensor array, and the arrival of T'Pol and Enterprise has unfortunately amplified their suspicions. When Enterprise attempts to contact the away team, Shran warns them not to interfere and destroys their communicators. During interrogation, wrongly disbelieving Archer's protestations of ignorance, the Andorians beat him. Seeing Archer, the monks relent and take Commander Tucker to an ancient transmitter in the catacombs. After repairing the device, Archer manages to send a signal to Enterprise to tell them to wait. Soon, Lieutenant Reed and a security team transport into the tunnels, taking out most of the Andorians with explosive charges and phaser fire. Shran escapes into the Reliquary, where a fire-fight reveals a large modern door. Archer manages to open it, revealing a high-tech sensor chamber. With the Vulcan deception exposed, Archer lets the Andorians go with T'Pol's palm scanner as evidence of the installation. Shran remarks that he is now in Archer's debt. Production During the first season of Enterprise, production designer Herman Zimmerman described \\"The Andorian Incident\\" as the most challenging episode with the exception of the pilot, \\"Broken Bow\\". This was because of the volume of work that was required to build the Vulcan monastery of P'Jem. Reception In 2016, Empire ranked this the 36th best out of the top 50 episodes of the 700 plus Star Trek television episodes. In 2016 The Hollywood Reporter ranked \\"The Andorian Incident\\" the 100th best Star Trek episode, noting how it established the story for the Andorians and Vulcans in the series. A binge-watch guide for Enterprise did not recommend skipping this episode. In a 2015 interview with some of the show's cast, SyFy recommended this episode as an Enterprise cast favorite. In 2016, Treknews.net had \\"The Andorian Incident\\" ranked as one of the top ten episodes of Enterprise; they note how Captain Archer must deal with an Andorian, Shran, who is introduced in this episode.

It is depicted in a diagram in an 11th-century Byzantine manuscript, but in Western Europe is more evident in the late 12th century and early 13th century. It was constructed on the same principles as a Greek or Roman ballista, but with inward swinging arms. It was also known as a 'skein-bow', and was a torsion device using twisted skeins of silk or sinew to power two bow-arms.Nicolle, pp. 173‚Äì174, the espringal is depicted, in the form of a fairly detailed diagram, in an 11th-century Byzantine manuscript Examples have been drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, but at a time when he was also drawing powder-propelled weapons. There are no known archaeological finds of parts for these machines, but it is highly likely that due to the nature of the materials used that some material recycling took place at the time of their demise. Reconstructions Modern reconstruction of a torsion springald, the twisted skeins powering the inward projecting bow arms can be seen. Displayed at the Tower of London Several reconstructed examples can be found, Jean Leibell produced a model for his researches into \\"Springalds and Great Crossbows\\" which was commissioned by the Royal Armouries Museum, and a larger model can be seen at the Tower of London. The only known full-size example is in the Royal Armouries Museum at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth at around long and capable of hurling a bolt over (in excess of its expected range) and a bolt over . This example was removed by the manufacturer, The Tenghesvisie Mechanical Artillery Society, for further research into the winding mechanism and firing tests. The machine was to be returned to the museum in the spring of 2013 for a public demonstration of mechanical artillery at Fort Nelson. There also exists or existed a huge springald at Trebuchet Park, Albarrac√≠n, Spain. Size Although Leibell describes this size of machine as a \\"Great Springald\\", it is more likely to be the standard size. If the evidence is investigated, such as the size of the figures in \\"The Romance of Alexander\\",Bodleian Library, Oxford where they are at about the height of the top horns, there is no evidence to suggest that they are dwarves, although the length of the bolt to be fired may be a little on the long side.

It is a form of sex linkage. Y linkage can be difficult to detect. This is partly because the Y chromosome is small and contains fewer genes than the autosomal chromosomes or the X chromosome. It is estimated to contain about 200 genes. Earlier, the human Y chromosome was thought to have little importance;. Although the Y-chromosome is sex- determining in humans and some other species, not all genes that play a role in sex determination are Y-linked. The Y-chromosome, generally does not undergo genetic recombination and only small regions called pseudoautosomal regions exhibit recombination. The majority of the Y-chromosome genes that do not recombine are located in the \\"non-recombining region\\". For a trait to be considered Y linkage, it must exhibit these characteristics: * occurs only in males * appears in all sons of males who exhibit that trait * is absent from daughters of trait carriers; instead the daughters that are phenotypically normal and do not have affected offspring. These requirements were established by the pioneer of Y linkage, Curt Stern. Stern detailed in his paper genes he suspected to be y-linked. His requirements at first made Y linkage hard to prove. In the 1950s using human pedigrees, many genes were incorrectly determined to be Y-linked. Later research adopted more advanced techniques and more sophisticated statistical analysis. Hairy ears are an example of a gene once thought to be Y-linked in humans; however, that hypothesis was discredited. Due to advancements in DNA sequencing, Y linkage is getting easier to determine and prove. The Y-chromosome is almost entirely mapped, revealing many y-linked traits. Y linkage is similar to, but different than X linkage; although, both are forms of sex linkage. X linkage can be genetically linked and sex-linked, while Y linkage can only be genetically linked. This is because males' cells have only one copy of the Y-chromosome. X-chromosomes have two copies, one from each parent permitting recombination. The X chromosome contains more genes and is substantially larger. Some ostensibly Y-linked have not been confirmed. One example is hearing impairment. Hearing impairment was tracked in one specific family and through seven generations all males were affected by this trait. However, this trait occurs rarely and has not been entirely resolved. Y-chromosome deletions are a frequent genetic cause of male infertility. Animals Guppies = In guppies, Y-linked genes help determine sex selection. This is done indirectly by traits that allow the guppy to appear more attractive to a prospective mate. These traits were shown to be on the Y-chromosome and thus Y-linked. Also in guppies, it appears that the four measures of sexual activity is Y-linked. =Rats= Hypertension, or high blood pressure, appears to be Y-linked in the hypertensive rat. One loci was autosomal. However, the second component appeared to be Y-linked. This held through the third generation of rats. Male offspring with a hypertensive father had significantly higher blood pressure than male offspring with a hypertensive mother indicating that a component of the trait was Y-linked. The results were not the same in females as in males, further hinting at a Y-component.  Hairy ears  Hairy ears were thought to be a Y-linked trait, but this was disproven. Genes known to be contained on the human Y chromosome In general, traits that exist on the Y chromosome are Y-linked because they only occur on that chromosome and do not change in recombination. As of 2000, a number of genes were known to be Y-linked, including: *ASMTY (acetylserotonin methyltransferase), *TSPY (testis-specific protein), *IL3RAY (interleukin-3 receptor), *SRY (sex-determining region), *TDF (testis determining factor), *ZFY (zinc finger protein), *PRKY (protein kinase, Y-linked), *AMGL (amelogenin), *ANT3Y (adenine nucleotide translocator-3 on the Y), *SOX21 (known to cause baldness), *AZF2 (azoospermia factor 2), *BPY2 (basic protein on the Y chromosome), *AZF1 (azoospermia factor 1), *DAZ (Spermatogenes is deleted in azoospermia), *RBM1 (RNA binding motif protein, Y chromosome, family 1, member A1), *RBM2 (RNA binding motif protein 2), and *UTY (ubiquitously transcribed TPR gene on Y chromosome). *USP9Y *AMELY  See also  *Genetic linkage *Sex linkage *X linkage ReferencesExternal links * Y-linked Genetic Diseases at wrongdiagnosis.com * http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/pigeons/sexlinkage/ * http://www.livestrong.com/article/74388-y-linked-genetic-diseases/ * http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15729 * https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22266/#A296 * http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/pigeons/geneticlinkage/ Category:Genetics ¬± ","title":"Y linkage"},{"id":"1632661","text":"The Dennis Dominator was Dennis's first rear-engined double-decker bus chassis, it was launched in 1977.

The Dominator was described as bespoke, with numerous options. To some extent it was considered a successor to the Daimler/Leyland Fleetline. The Dominator was different from the Fleetline in that the radiator was located at the front instead of the offside of the engine compartment. It was intended to be sold mainly with the Gardner 6LXB engine coupled up to a Voith DIWA transmission and a drop-centre rear axle, but hub-reduction rear axle and other engine options including the Rolls-Royce Eagle, the Cummins L10, the turbocharged Gardner 6LXCT and DAF engines were also available.Dominator unveiled Commercial Motor 2 September 1977Alternative power Commercial Motor 27 September 1980 United Kingdom The largest British customer of the Dennis Dominator was South Yorkshire PTE, with a total of 323 buses being delivered to the company. These included one trolleybus which was built in 1985 for test and evaluation. Many had Rolls-Royce Eagle engines and hub-reduction axles. Most of the SYPTE vehicles received Alexander RH bodywork, these being delivered between 1981‚Äì1986, though some were bodied by East Lancs and Northern Counties. The SYPTE Dominators were delivered in phases to replace Daimler Fleetlines, Leyland Atlanteans, Volvo Ailsa B55s, some of which dated to the early 1970s. The final batch of Dominators delivered to Sheffield included 20 vehicles fitted with coach seats and were allocated to regionwide express services with the distinctive Fastline branding. The high standard of engineering led to the last Dominators in South Yorkshire remaining in service in Doncaster until July 2006. The Dominator also appealed to municipal operators such as Leicester City Transport who from 1977 bought 143, mainly with East Lancs bodies although seven had Marshall bodies, all of which were withdrawn from public service by 2005. It was also sold in reasonable numbers to Central Scottish from 1981 with Alexander low-height RL-type bodywork. Other notable Dominator users included Greater Manchester Transport/GM Buses all of which had Northern Counties bodywork, Warrington Borough Transport with East Lancs bodies Merseyside Transport with Willowbrook and Alexander RH bodies and London Transport who took three with Northern Counties bodywork for its new bus evaluation trails in the mid-1980s. Production of the Dominator was less consistent after bus deregulation in 1986 with production being sporadic during the 1992‚Äì96 period. Eight were built in 1992; three in 1993; none in 1994 or 1995; and a final four built in 1996.Dennis Dominator Bus Lists on the Web London Pride Sightseeing has been a considerable user for the second-hand Dennis Dominators.

So, in 1978, it ordered a single-deck version of the Dominator with an extended-wheelbase, designed for 11-metre coachwork, this was bodied by Marshall and the style, dual door with 46 seats, when exhibited on the Dennis stand at the 1978 Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre was named Camair 80. David Cox, then Engineering Director of Merseyside PTE, reviewed it under his alias Midlander for Buses. He commented that the design was nothing like as stylish, but probably cheaper to produce than the original Marshall Camair. He felt that the side-facing bench seats over the front wheel arches, with their deep footstools, gave a rather tunnel-like aspect, and offered his ideas on a tidier layout, but praised the principle of using the same chassis for double and single-deck applications. Darlington took a further nine in the following year. Dennis designated all ten of these SD103A. They were the only customer to place a repeat order (in 1981) for eight outwardly identical vehicles coded SD128A. Darlington's next purchase was to be the only batch of Ward Motors Dalesman GRXI in 1984. The next customer was the borough of Hartlepool, a neighbouring fleet and another that was all single-deck, they chose East Lancashire Coachbuilders to body their six. Unlike Marshall, East Lancs did not build over the engine compartment, giving an effect reminiscent of Birmingham's single-deck Fleetlines and Great Yarmouth's single-deck Atlanteans, which had been bodied respectively in 1965 and 1967 by Marshall. With dual-doors the Hartlepool buses sat only 43. Hartlepool had never operated Fleetlines of any sort, and had reluctantly switched from Leyland-engined Bristol REs with dual-door Eastern Coach Works bodies to Leyland Nationals before these buses, their first since the 1950s with Gardner engines. They were later to take Leyland National 2s and Dennis Falcons. A number of chief engineers working for operators in the North of England met regularly at the time at gatherings sponsored by the Traffic Commissioner, as well as Tyne & Wear PTE, United Automobile Services, Northern General Transport Company, Trimdon Motor Services, Cleveland Transit, Darlington and Hartlepool these included Barrow in Furness Borough Transport. They also were all-single deck at the time, but contemplating future double deck orders. So their numbers 18 and 19 carried similar bodies to the Hartlepool buses, but with only a front entry/exit door and 46 seats. These two batches shared the same SD115 type code, and chassis numbers for the two batches comprised a single series. Barrow had a batch of five East Lancs bodied single-deck Fleetlines delivered in 1971, which were 50 seaters with seating above the engine, but since those Barrow Borough Transport had switched to the locally-built Leyland National, it was problems with the Leyland 510 engines on these as well as standardisation with prospective double deckers that led to Barrow's purchase of Dominators. Barrow were to order double deckers in 1984, but these turned out to be Leyland Atlanteans. The fourth customer was Merthyr Tydfil Transport, another all single-deck fleet, like Hartlepool, no Fleetlines were operated. The fleet consisted of East Lancs-bodied Leopards, Bristol REs with East Lancs and Eastern Coach Works bodies, Leyland Nationals and a batch of Metro-Scanias. Hartlepools single-deck Dominators had its first East Lancs bodies, Merthyr Tydfil's their first Marshall bodies. Their six (coded SD116) had single-door 50 seat Camair 80 coachwork. Like Hartlepool Leyland National 2s followed. Later in life, these buses were sold to the City of Chester, whose General Manager had previously worked at Darlington. The penultimate customer took their single- deck Dominator, the sole SD130A, some months after the final new customer's batch was delivered but this was no surprise as the job involved was a lot more complex than a bus body. EBB846W was to the bespoke specification of the Tyne and Wear Metropolitan Fire Brigade and the vehicle was constructed by fire-appliance specialists Angloco, it was the fire brigade's number 319, and it was comprehensively fitted-out as a control and communications centre for major incidents. The body was low and angular, looking to be over the bus maximum width of 2.5m. It had two outward-opening doors on the nearside and a single 'passenger' window in mid wheelbase. It was liveried in fire-engine red, the grille was an unadorned mesh affair in an otherwise flat front, featuring a divided flat-glazed windscreen. The final customer for the single- deck Dominator were a fleet who had Fleetlines, but only double-deckers, this was Swindon based Thamesdown Transport. A proportion of the fleet had to be single-deck because of railway bridges (like Darlington, Swindon was a town built on railways) and prior to 1980 the single deckers were five Weymann- bodied AEC Reliances, three Leyland Leopard PSU4 with Pennine Coachcraft bodies and five late-model coach-seated Eastern Coach Works Bodied Bristol RESL6G. Thamesdown's numbers 1-4 (FAM1-4W) were the only short-wheelbase single-deck Dominators, type SD132B, they had 40 coach seats in 10-metre single-door Marshall Camair 80 bodies. Unlike the other customers, Thamesdown later took substantial numbers of double-deck Dominators. Only 37 single-deck Dominators were built, all but the show bus in 1979-81. None are known to survive. The Camair 80 body also went on four 1970 Fleetlines for Tayside, Strathclyde PTE's single deck Ailsa, a number of Dennis Falcons and in a unique demountable-body version on Dodge Commando, again for Strathclyde PTE. G.G. Hillditch, who had been one of the inspirations behind the Dominator and, at the time as General Manager of Leicester City Transport, was the launch customer for the type, had earlier (when General Manager of the Halifax Corporation, Halifax Joint Committee and Todmorden Joint Committee fleets) been one of the customers requesting the SRG6 Fleetline single-decker, but when Leicester required further single deckers from 1980 instead of ordering the Dominator he commissioned the Dennis Falcon H. Export orders Kowloon Motor Bus Duple Metsec bodied Dominator in August 2001 The Dominator was also sold to Hong Kong. China Motor Bus put the first Dominator (with East Lancs body) into service in 1979, being followed by six with Alexander RL-type body in 1982, primarily for its route 15 (Central-The Peak). Kowloon Motor Bus bought 40 Duple Metsec bodied Dominators between 1983 and 1984.Kowloon buys British Commercial Motor 30 October 1982\\"Hong Kong Buses Part 3: Kowloon Motor Bus\\" Fleetline issue 249 July 1997 page 118 One Dominator with East Lancs body and DAF engine was exported as demonstrator for Singapore Bus Service in 1982. It was shipped to Hong Kong after the trial and entered Kowloon Motor Bus' training fleet in 1986. End of production After a production of 1007, the Dominator was replaced by the short-lived longitudinal-engined Dennis Arrow in 1996. Dominator variantsDennis Falcon= In 1980, Dennis developed the Falcon single-deck bus with longitudinally-mounted rear engine. The Falcon H variant had a horizontal Gardner engine with the Voith gearbox mounted ahead of the rear axle, the later Falcon HC had the Voith transmission mounted behind the rear axle and close-coupled to the Gardner engine. The Falcon V variant had vertical engines. =Dennis Dragon/Condor= In 1982, a tri-axle version was developed for the Hong Kong market, known as the Dennis Dragon which was sold to Kowloon Motor Bus. The same model was sold to China Motor Bus, but was known as the Condor. They were usually bodied by Duple Metsec. Some were purchased by Stagecoach for its Kenyan and Malawi operations. Some of these were repatriated to the UK through dealer Ensignbus. They are used for school runs and sightseeing since they have high-capacity. =Dennis Domino= In 1984, Dennis introduced a midibus chassis which was a scaled down Dominator, it could be fitted with Perkins T6.354 and Avon Maxwell transmission. It was only sold to two customers, Greater Manchester Transport and South Yorkshire Transport. The Dominos for Greater Manchester Transport were Northern Counties bodied, and South Yorkshire Transport ones were bodied by Optare.

M√°rio Sch√∂nberg, Mario Schonberg, M√°rio Schoenberg; July 2, 1914 ‚Äì November 10, 1990) was a Brazilian electrical engineer, physicist, art critic and writer. Early life  Schenberg was born in Recife, Brazil. His parents were Russian-Jewish of German origin. From early on he showed remarkable ability for mathematics, enchanting himself with geometry, which had a strong influence on his works. Schenberg took the primary and secondary courses in Recife. Because of his family's financial limitations, he was not able to study in Europe. He then entered the Faculty of Engineering of Recife in 1931.  Scientific work  The Urca process = Widely regarded as one of Brazil's most important theoretical physicists, Schenberg is best remembered for his contributions to astrophysics, particularly the theory of nuclear processes in the formation of supernova stars. He provided the inspiration for the name of the so-called Urca process, a cycle of nuclear reactions in which a nucleus loses energy by absorbing an electron and then re-emitting a beta particle plus a neutrino-antineutrino pair, leading to the loss of internal supporting pressure and consequent collapse and explosion in the form of a supernova. George Gamow (1904‚Äì1968) was inspired to name the process Urca after the name of a casino in Rio de Janeiro, when Schenberg remarked to him that \\"the energy disappears in the nucleus of the supernova as quickly as the money disappeared at that roulette table\\". = Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limit = Together with Indian physicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910‚Äì1995), he discovered and published in 1942 the so-called Sch√∂nberg‚ÄìChandrasekhar limit, which is the maximum mass of the core of a star that can support the overlying layers against gravitational collapse, once the core hydrogen is exhausted. = Quantum physics and geometric algebra = In the University of S√£o Paulo had Sch√∂nberg interacted closely with David Bohm during the final years of Bohm's exile in Brazil,Interview with Basil Hiley conducted by Olival Freire on January 11, 2008, Oral History Transcript, Niels Bohr Library & Archives, American Institute of Physics and in 1954 Sch√∂nberg demonstrated a link among the quantized motion of the Madelung fluid and the trajectories of the de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory. (abstract) He wrote a series of publications of 1957/1958 on geometric algebras that stand in relation to quantum physics and quantum field theory. He pointed out that those algebras can be described in terms of extensions of the commutative and the anti- commutative Grassmann algebras which have the same structure as the boson algebra and the fermion algebra of creation and annihilation operators. These algebras, in turn, are related to the symplectic algebra and Clifford algebra, respectively.F. A. M. Frescura, B. J.

Overview The diploma can build on the general or disciplinary knowledge of a bachelor's degree to prepare students to teach in schools although this is no longer true of the UK where Qualified Teacher Status is the recognized professional qualification for those wishing to teach in (state) maintained primary and secondary schools. However, in the UK holders of the Cert Ed, awarded after completing a three-year teacher training course, could use the diploma as a route to degree equivalence, and if passed at the appropriate level progress to a master's degree in education. The Graduate Diploma in Education is a one- year teacher preparation program for students who already hold a tertiary degree. Specialisation within the course usually enables one to become a primary or secondary teacher, or a teacher in an adult education environment such as TAFE or a business college, and to join the relevant professional association. Achievement of a Diploma of Education does not normally confer registration status, but is a pathway to registration as a teacher. The DipEd typically takes one year of full-time study (up to two years part-time) and students are generally required to undertake professional practicums (or \\"pracs\\") alongside their theory units in order to graduate. It offers an alternative to the three- or four-year Bachelor of Education for those who already have a degree in another area (e.g. Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts) and wish to specialise in that area. In Australia, the Graduate Diploma in Education, typically a 1-year programme, was gradually phased out in favour of a 2-year Master of Teaching course. This is the result of a requirement by the Australian Institution for Teaching and School Leadership that post graduate qualification must be of 2 years' duration. All graduate diploma programs will be phased out by December 2017. The course is referred to as a Diploma of Teaching in New Zealand. Diploma of Education ensuring high quality teacher education is a first and critical step in delivering high quality teaching in schools, particularly at a time when the role of teachers is becoming increasingly complex and demanding.

The song is said to have been inspired by Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, one of the many mistresses of King Edward VII. It is the earliest song sung using computer speech synthesis by the IBM 7094 in 1961, a feat which was referenced in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).

(Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks by Leopold von Ranke. Preface, pg. x) Therefore, any work classed as such purportedly attempts to embrace the events of all times and nations in so far as scientific treatment of them is possible.Leopold von Ranke. Universal history: the oldest historical group of nations and the Greeks. Scribner, 1884. An epitome of universal history by A. Harding. Page 1. Universal history in the Western tradition is commonly divided into three parts, viz. ancient, medieval, and modern time.H. M. Cottinger. Elements of universal history for higher institutes in republics and for self-instruction. Charles H. Whiting, 1884. pg. 1+. The division on ancient and medieval periods is less sharp or absent in the Arabic and Asian historiographies. A synoptic view of universal history led some scholars, beginning with Karl Jaspers,The Origin and Goal of History, (London: Yale University Press, 1949). to distinguish the Axial Age synchronous to \\"classical antiquity\\" of the Western tradition.Samuel N. Eisenstadt, Axial Age Civilizations, (New York: New York State University Press, 1986). Jaspers also proposed a more universal periodization‚Äîprehistory, history and planetary history. All distinguished earlier periods belong to the second period (history) which is a relatively brief transitory phase between two much longer periods. Historiography The roots of historiography in the 19th century are bound up with the concept that history written with a strong connection to the primary sources could be integrated with \\"the big picture\\", i.e. to a general, universal history. For example, Leopold von Ranke, probably the pre-eminent historian of the 19th century, founder of Rankean historical positivism,Zubin Meer (ed.), Individualism: The Cultural Logic of Modernity, Lexington Books, 2011, p. 4. the classic mode of historiography that now stands against postmodernism, attempted to write a Universal History at the close of his career. The works of world historians Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee are examples of attempts to integrate primary source-based history and Universal History. Spengler's work is more general; Toynbee created a theory that would allow the study of \\"civilizations\\" to proceed with integration of source-based history writing and Universal History writing.Donald A. Yerxa. Recent Themes in World History and the History of the West: Historians in Conversation. Univ of South Carolina Press, 2009. Page 1+ Both writers attempted to incorporate teleological theories into general presentations of the history. Toynbee found as the telos (goal) of universal history the emergence of a single World State. Instances and descriptionAncient examples=Hebrew Bible A project of Universal history may be seen in the Hebrew Bible, which from the point of view of its redactors in the 5th century BC presents a history of humankind from creation to the Flood, and from there a history of the Israelites down to the present. The Seder Olam is a 2nd-century CE rabbinic interpretation of this chronology. Greco- Roman historiography In Greco-Roman antiquity, the first universal history was written by Ephorus (fl. 4th century BC). This work has been lost, but its influence can be seen in the ambitions of Polybius (203‚Äì120 BC) and Diodorus (fl. 1st century BC) to give comprehensive accounts of their worlds. Herodotus' History is the earliest surviving member of the Greco-Roman world- historical tradition, although under some definitions of universal history it does not qualify as universal because it reflects no attempt to describe an overall direction of history or a principle or set of principles governing or underlying it. Polybius was the first to attempt a universal history in this stricter sense of the term: Metamorphoses by Ovid has been considered as a universal history because of its comprehensive chronology‚Äîfrom the creation of mankind to the death of Julius Caesar a year before the poet's birth. In Leipzig are preserved five fragments dating to the 2nd century AD and coming from a world chronicle. Its author is unknown, but was perhaps a Christian. Later, universal history provided an influential lens on the rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire in such works as Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History, Augustine's City of God, and Orosius' History Against the Pagans. Chinese historiography During the Han Dynasty (202 BCE ‚Äì 220 CE) of China, Sima Qian (145‚Äì86 BC) was the first Chinese historian to attempt a universal history‚Äîfrom the earliest mythological origins of his civilization to his present day‚Äîin his Records of the Grand Historian. Although his generation was the first in China to discover the existence of kingdoms in Central Asia and India, his work did not attempt to cover the history of these regions. =Medieval examples=Western Europe The universal chronicle traces history from the beginning of the world up to the present and was an especially popular genre of historiography in medieval Western Europe. The universal chronicle differs from the ordinary chronicle in its much broader chronological and geographical scope, giving, in principle, a continuous account of the progress of world history from the creation of the world up to the author's own times, but in practice often narrowing down to a more limited geographical range as it approaches those times. The Chronica of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 275‚Äì339) is considered to be the starting point of this tradition. The second book of this work consisted of a set of concordance tables (Chronici canones) that for the first time synchronized the several concurrent chronologies in use with different peoples. Eusebius' chronicle became known to the Latin West through the translation by Jerome (c. 347‚Äì420). Universal chronicles are sometimes organized around a central ideological theme, such as the Augustinian idea of the tension between the heavenly and the earthly state, as depicted in the City of God, which plays a major role in Otto von Freising's Historia de duabus civitatibus. Augustine's thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography as it takes place on planet Earth. In this war God moves (by divine intervention/ Providence) those governments, political /ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God) in order to oppose by all means‚Äîincluding military‚Äîthose governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of Devil). In other cases, any obvious theme may be lacking. Some universal chronicles bear a more or less encyclopedic character, with many digressions on non-historical subjects, as is the case with the Chronicon of Helinand of Froidmont. Other notable universal chroniclers of the Medieval West include Bede (c. 672 or 673‚Äì735), the Christherre-Chronik, Helinand of Froidmont (c. 1160‚Äîafter 1229), Isidore of Seville (c. 560‚Äì636), Jans der Enikel, Matthew Paris (c. 1200-1259), Ranulf Higdon (c. 1280-1363), Rudolf von Ems, Sigebert of Gembloux (c. 1030‚Äì1112), Otto von Freising (c. 1114‚Äì1158), and Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1190-1264?). The tradition of universal history can even be seen in the works of medieval historians whose purpose may not have been to chronicle the ancient past, but nonetheless included it in a local history of more recent times. One such example is the Decem Libri Historiarum of Gregory of Tours (d. 594), where only the first of his ten books describes creation and ancient history, while the last six books focus on events in his own lifetime and region. While this reading of Gregory is currently a widely accepted hypothesis in historical circles, the central purpose of Gregory's writing is still a topic of hot debate.Wood, Ian. Gregory of Tours. (Bangor: Headstart History, 1994.)Mitchell, Kathleen and Wood, Ian, eds.. The World of Gregory of Tours. (Boston: Brill, 2002). Historiography of early Islam In the medieval Islamic world (13th century), universal history in this vein was taken up by Muslim historians such as Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini (\\"The History of The World Conqueror\\") by Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni, Jami al-Tawarikh (\\"Compendium of Chronicles\\") by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (now held at the University of Edinburgh) and the Muqaddimah by Ibn Khaldun. =Modern historiography= An early European project was the Universal History of George Sale and others, written in the mid-18th century. Christian writers as late as Bossuet in his Discours sur l'histoire universelle (Speech of Universal History) are still reflecting on and continuing the Medieval tradition of universal history.Bossuet, J. B. Discours sur l'histoire universelle (Paris, Furne et cie, 1853). Speech of Universal History is considered by many Catholics as an actual second edition or continuation of the City of God. In this work Bossuet continues to provide an update of universal history according to Augustine's thesis of universal war between those humans that follow God and those who follow the Devil. This concept of world history guided by Divine Providence in a universal war between God and Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the Second Vatican Council' s Gaudium et Spes document: \\"The Church . . . holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings.\\" In the 19th century, universal histories proliferated. Philosophers such as Kant,\\"Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose\\" in On History, (tr. Lewis White Beck, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1963). Herder,Universal History, (tr. F. Wilson, New York: 1953). Schiller and Hegel,The Philosophy of History, (tr. Robert S. Hartman, Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merill Co, 1956). and political philosophers such as Marx and Herbert Spencer, presented general theories of history that shared essential characteristics with the Biblical account: they conceived of history as a coherent whole, governed by certain basic characteristics or immutable principles. Kant who was one of the earliest thinkers to use the term Universal History described its meaning in \\"Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose\\": Universal chroniclesAncient= Ancient history is the study of the past from the beginning of recorded human history to the Early Middle Ages. In India, the period includes the early period of the Middle Kingdoms,Elphinstone, M. (1889). The history of India. London: Murray.Smith, V. A. (1904).

The First Intermediate Period of Egypt (c. 22nd century BC) was followed by the Middle Kingdom of Egypt between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The Sumerian Renaissance also developed c. 21st century BC. Around the 18th century BC, the Second Intermediate Period of Egypt began. By 1600 BC, Mycenaean Greece developed, the beginning of the Shang Dynasty in China emerged and there was evidence of a fully developed Chinese writing system. Also around 1600 BC, the beginning of Hittite dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean region is seen. From the 16th to 11th centuries BC the New Kingdom of Egypt dominated the Nile Valley. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the Amarna Period developed. The Iron Age is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region. During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the Ramesside Period occurred in Egypt. Around c. 1200 BC, the Trojan War was thought to have taken place.Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon & Schuster By c. 1180 BC, the disintegration of the Hittite Empire was underway. In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by King Wu of Zhou, overthrows the last king of the Shang Dynasty. The Zhou Dynasty is established in China shortly thereafter. In 1000 BC, the Mannaeans Kingdom begins in Western Asia. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire forms in Mesopotamia. In 800 BC, the rise of Greek city-states begins. In 776 BC, the first recorded Olympic Games are held.

F. J. Huntington, 1835. Page 3 The medieval \\\\+ (middle + age); See Middle and Age. history is the middle period, or the middle age, in a three-period division of history: Classic, Medieval, and Modern. The precise dates of the beginning, culmination, and end of the medieval history are more or less arbitrarily assumed according to the point of view adopted. Any hard and fast line drawn to designate either the beginning or close of the period in question is arbitrary. The widest limits given, viz., the irruption of the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire, for the beginning, and the Middle Ages of the 16th century, for the close, may be taken as inclusively sufficient, and embrace, beyond dispute, every movement or phase of history that can be claimed as properly belonging to the medieval history. In Europe, the period saw the large-scale European Migration and fall of the Western Roman Empire. In South Asia, the middle kingdoms of India were the classical period of the region. The \\"Medieval\\" period on the Indian subcontinent lasts for some 1,500 years, and ends in the 13th century. During the late medieval history, several Islamic empires were established in the Indian subcontinent. In East Asia, the Mid-Imperial China age begins with the reunification of China and ends with China was conquered by the Mongol Empire. The Golden Horde invaded North and West Asia and parts of eastern Europe in the 13th century and established and maintained their khanate until the end of the medieval history. The Early medieval history saw the continuation of trends set up in ancient history (and, for Europe, late Antiquity). The period is usually considered to open with those migrations of the German Tribes which led to the destruction of the Roman Empire in the West in 375, when the Huns fell upon the Gothic tribes north of the Black Sea and forced the Visigoths over the boundaries of the Roman Empire on the lower Danube. A later date, however, is sometimes assumed, viz., when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last of the Roman Emperors of the West, in 476. Depopulation, deurbanization, and increased barbarian invasion were seen across the Old World. North Africa and the Middle East, once part of the Eastern Roman Empire, became Islamic. Later in European history, the establishment of the feudal system allowed a return to systemic agriculture. There was sustained urbanization in northern and western Europe. During the High medieval history in Europe, Christian-oriented art and architecture flourished and Crusades were mounted to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control. The influence of the emerging states in Europe was tempered by the ideal of an international Christendom. The codes of chivalry and courtly love set rules for proper European behavior, while the European Scholastic philosophers attempted to reconcile Christian faith and reason. During the Late medieval history in Europe, the centuries of prosperity and growth came to a halt. The close of the medieval history is also variously fixed; some make it coincide with the rise of Humanism and the Renaissance in Italy, in the 14th century; with the Fall of Constantinople, in 1453; with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492; or, again, with the great religious schism of the 16th century. A series of famines and plagues, such as the medieval Great Famine and the Black Death, reduced the population around half before the calamities in the late medieval history. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. Western Europe experienced serious peasant risings: the Jacquerie, the Peasants' Revolt, and the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively the events are a crisis of the Late medieval history.

Contemporary history describes the span of historic events that are immediately relevant to the present time. The Great Divergencea term coined by Samuel Huntington refers to the period of time in which the process by which the Western Europe and the parts of the New World overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time, eclipsing Qing China, Mughal India, Tokugawa Japan, and the Ottoman Empire. The modern era began approximately in the 16th century.Dunan, Marcel. Larousse Encyclopedia of Modern History, From 1500 to the Present Day. New York: Harper & Row, 1964. Many major events caused Europe to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the fall of Muslim Spain and the discovery of the Americas in 1492, and Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation in 1517. In England the modern period is often dated to the start of the Tudor period with the victory of Henry VII over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman. Early modern British history, 1485-1760: a select bibliography, Historical Association, 1970Early Modern Period (1485-1800), Sites Organized by Period, Rutgers University Libraries Early modern European history is usually seen to span from around the start of the 15th century, through the Age of Reason and the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.  Early modern age  The modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include: * The Renaissance * The Reformation and Counter Reformation. * The Age of Discovery * Rise of capitalism The early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of mechanization in society, the American Revolution, the first French Revolution; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna and the peace established by Second Treaty of Paris which ended the Napoleonic Wars.Hazen, Charles Downer (1910).

inequality grew substantially in the United States and to a lesser extent in other countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom. The term originated with Nobel laureate, Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman,Krugman, Paul, The Conscience of a Liberal, W W Norton & Company, 2007, p.124-8 and is a reference to the \\"Great Compression\\", an earlier era in the 1930s and 40s when income became dramatically more equal in the United States and elsewhere.The Great Divergence.

It sits on the east bank of the Hudson River, about north of Midtown Manhattan. The station currently generates about 1,000 megawatts (MWe) of electrical power. For reference, the record peak energy consumption of New York City and Westchester County (the ConEdison Service Territory) was set during a seven-day heat wave on July 19, 2013, at 13,322 megawatts. Electrical energy consumption varies greatly with time of day and season. The station is owned and operated by Entergy Nuclear Northeast, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, and consists of one operating Westinghouse pressurized water reactor designated \\"Indian Point Unit 3 (IP3)\\" and two permanently deactivated reactors (designated Indian Point Unit 1 (IP1) and Indian Point Unit 2 (IP2)). Entergy purchased Units 1 and 2 from Consolidated Edison in 2001 and Unit 3 from the New York Power Authority in 2000. , the number of permanent jobs at the Buchanan plant is approximately 1,000. The original 40-year operating licenses for units 2 and 3 expired in September 2013 and December 2015, respectively. Entergy had applied for license extensions and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was moving toward granting a twenty-year extension for each reactor. However, after pressure from local environmental groups and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, it was announced that the plant is scheduled to be shut down by 2021. Local groups had cited increasingly frequent issues with the aging units, ongoing environmental releases, and the proximity of the plant to New York City.  Reactors  History and design = The reactors are built on land that originally housed the Indian Point Amusement Park, but was acquired by Consolidated Edison (ConEdison) on October 14, 1954. Indian Point 1, built by ConEdison, was a 275-megawatt Babcock & Wilcox supplied History pressurized water reactor that was issued an operating license on March 26, 1962 and began operations on September 16, 1962. The first core used a thorium-based fuel with stainless steel cladding, but this fuel did not live up to expectations for core life. The plant was operated with uranium dioxide fuel for the remainder of its life. The reactor was shut down on October 31, 1974, because the emergency core cooling system did not meet regulatory requirements. All spent fuel was removed from the reactor vessel by January 1976, but the reactor still stands. The licensee, Entergy, plans to decommission Unit 1 when Unit 2 is decommissioned. The two additional reactors, Indian Point 2 and 3, are four-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactors both of similar design. Units 2 and 3 were completed in 1974 and 1976, respectively. Unit 2 has a generating capacity of 1,032 MW, and Unit 3 has a generating capacity of 1,051 MW. Both reactors use uranium dioxide fuel of no more than 4.8% U-235 enrichment. The reactors at Indian Point are protected by containment domes made of steel-reinforced concrete that is 40 inches thick, with a carbon steel liner. = Nuclear capacity in New York state= Units 2 and 3 are two of six operating nuclear energy sources in New York State. New York is one of the five largest states in terms of nuclear capacity and generation, accounting for approximately 5% of the national totals. Indian Point provides 39% of the state's nuclear capacity. Nuclear power produces 34.2% of the state's electricity, higher than the U.S. average of 20.6%. In 2017, Indian Point generated approximately 10% of the state's electricity needs, and 25% of the electricity used in New York City and Westchester County. Its contract with Consolidated Edison is for just 560 megawatts. The New York Power Authority, which built Unit 3, stopped buying electricity from Indian Point in 2012. NYPA supplies the subways, airports, and public schools and housing in NYC and Westchester County. Entergy sells the rest of Indian Point's output into the NYISO administered electric wholesale markets and elsewhere in New England. In 2013, New York had the fourth highest average electricity prices in the United States. Half of New York's power demand is in the New York City region; about two-fifths of generation originates there. = Refueling = The currently operating Units 2 and 3 are each refueled on a two-year cycle. At the end of each fuel cycle, one unit is brought offline for refueling and maintenance activities. On March 2, 2015, Indian Point 3 was taken offline for 23 days to perform its refueling operations. Entergy invested $50,000,000 in the refueling and other related projects for Unit 3, of which $30,000,000 went to employee salaries. The unit was brought back online on March 25, 2015.  Effects  Economic impact = A June 2015 report by a lobby group called Nuclear Energy Institute found that the operation of Indian Point generates $1.3 billion of annual economic output in local counties, $1.6 billion statewide, and $2.5 billion across the United States. In 2014, Entergy paid $30,000,000 in state and local property taxes. The total tax revenue (direct and secondary) was nearly $340,000,000 to local, state, and federal governments. According to the Village of Buchanan budget for 2016-2017, a payment in lieu of taxes in the amount of 2.62 million dollars was received in 2015-2016, and was projected to be 2.62 million dollars in 2016-2017 - the majority of which can be assumed to come from the Indian Point Energy Center. Over the last decade, the station has maintained a capacity factor of greater than 93%. This is consistently higher than the nuclear industry average and than other forms of generation. The reliability helps offset the severe price volatility of other energy sources (e.g., natural gas) and the indeterminacy of renewable electricity sources (e.g., solar, wind). Indian Point directly employs about 1,000 full-time workers. This employment creates another 2,800 jobs in the five-county region, and 1,600 in other industries in New York, for a total of 5,400 in-state jobs. Additionally, another 5,300 indirect jobs are created out of state, creating a sum total of 10,700 jobs throughout the United States. Closure of the plant is expected to create a $15,000,000 fund which will be split between \\"community and environmental\\" projects with the Riverkeeper environmental group expecting to receive half, which is subject of a debate with local community. = Environmental concerns = Environmentalists have expressed concern about increased carbon emissions with the impending deactivation of Indian Point (generating electricity with nuclear energy creates no carbon emissions). A study undertaken by Environmental Progress found that closure of the plant would cause power emissions to jump 29% in New York, equivalent to the emissions from 1.4 million additional cars on New York roads. Some environmental groups have expressed concerns about the operation of Indian Point, including radiation pollution and endangerment of wildlife, but whether Indian Point has ever posed a significant danger to wildlife or the public remains controversial. Though anti-nuclear group Riverkeeper notes \\"Radioactive leakage from the plant containing several radioactive isotopes, such as strontium-90, cesium-137, cobalt-60, nickel-63 and tritium, a rarely-occurring isotope of hydrogen, has flowed into groundwater that eventually enters the Hudson River in the past, there is no evidence radiation from the plant has ever posed a significant hazard to local residents or wildlife. In the last year, nine tritium leaks have occurred, however, even at their highest levels the leaks have never exceeded one-tenth of 1% of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission limits. In February 2016, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo called for a full investigation by state environmenthttp://www.governor.ny.gov: Statement from Governor Andrew M. Cuomo Regarding Indian Point Nuclear Facility and health officials and is partnering with organizations like Sierra Club, Riverkeepers, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition, Scenic Hudson and Physicians for Social Responsibility in seeking the permanent closure of the plant. However, Cuomo's motivation for closing the plant was called into question after it was revealed two top former aides, under federal prosecution for influence-peddling, had lobbied on behalf of natural gas company Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) to kill Indian Point. In his indictment, US attorney Preet Bharara wrote \\"the importance of the plant [CPV's proposed Valley Energy Center, a plant powered by natural gas] to the State depended at least in part, on whether [Indian Point] was going to be shut down.\\" In April 2016 climate scientist James Hansen took issue with calls to shut the plant down, including those from presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. \\"The last few weeks have seen an orchestrated campaign to mislead the people of New York about the essential safety and importance of Indian Point nuclear plant to address climate change,\\" wrote Hansen, adding \\"Sanders has offered no evidence that NRC [U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission] has failed to do its job, and he has no expertise in over-riding NRC's judgement. For the sake of future generations who could be harmed by irreversible climate change, I urge New Yorkers to reject this fear mongering and uphold science against ideology.‚Äù Indian Point removes water from the nearby Hudson River. Despite the use of fish screens, the cooling system kills over a billion fish eggs and larvae annually. According to one NRC report from 2010, as few as 38% of alewives survive the screens. On September 14, 2015, a state hearing began in regards to the deaths of fish in the river, and possibly implementing a deactivation period from May to August. An Indian Point spokesman stated that such a period would be unnecessary, as Indian Point \\"is fully protective of life in the Hudson River and $75 million has been spent over the last 30 years on scientific studies demonstrating that the plant has no harmful impact to adult fish.\\" The hearings lasted three weeks. Concerns were also raised over the planned building of new cooling towers, which would cut down forest land that is suspected to be used as breeding ground by muskrat and mink. At the time of the report, no minks or muskrats were spotted there.  Safety  Indian Point Energy Center has been given an heightened amount of scrutiny and is regulated more heavily than various other power plants in the state of New York (i.e., by the NRC in addition to FERC, the NYSPSC, the NYISO, the NYSDEC, and the EPA). On a forced outage basis ‚Äì incidents related to electrical equipment failure that force a plant stoppage ‚Äì it provides a much more reliable operating history than most other power plants in New York. Beginning at the end of 2015, Governor Cuomo began to ramp up political action against the Indian Point facility, opening an investigation with the state public utility commission, the department of health, and the department of environmental conservation.New York State Public Service Commission DMM case no. 15-02730NYSPSC DMM case no. 17-00994 To put the public service commission investigation in perspective: most electric outage investigations conducted by the commission are in response to outages with a known number of affected retail electric customers. By November 17, 2017, the NYISO accepted Indian Point's retirement notice. In 1997, Indian Point Unit 3 was removed from the NRC's list of plants that receive increased attention from the regulator. An engineer for the NRC noted that the plant had been experiencing increasingly fewer problems during inspections. On March 10, 2009 the Indian Point Power Plant was awarded the fifth consecutive top safety rating for annual operations by the Federal regulators. According to the Hudson Valley Journal News, the plant had shown substantial improvement in its safety culture in the previous two years. A 2003 report commissioned by then-Governor George Pataki concluded that the \\"current radiological response system and capabilities are not adequate to...protect the people from an unacceptable dose of radiation in the event of a release from Indian Point\\". More recently, in December 2012 Entergy commissioned a 400-page report on the estimates of evacuation times. This report, performed by emergency planning company KLD Engineering, concluded that the existing traffic management plans provided by Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester Counties are adequate and require no changes. According to one list that ranks U.S. nuclear power plants by their likelihood of having a major natural disaster related incident, Indian Point is the most likely to be hit by a natural disaster, mainly an earthquake. Despite this, the owners of the plant still say that safety is a selling point for the nuclear power plant. = Incidents = *In 1973, five months after Indian Point 2 opened, the plant was shut down when engineers discovered buckling in the steel liner of the concrete dome in which the nuclear reactor is housed. *On October 17, 1980, 100,000 gallons of Hudson River water leaked into the Indian Point 2 containment building from the fan cooling unit, undetected by a safety device designed to detect hot water. The flooding, covering the first nine feet of the reactor vessel, was discovered when technicians entered the building. Two pumps that should have removed the water were found to be inoperative. NRC proposed a $2,100,000 fine for the incident. *In February 2000, Unit 2 experienced a Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR), which allowed primary water to leak into the secondary system through one of the steam generators. All four steam generators were subsequently replaced. *In 2005, Entergy workers while digging discovered a small leak in a spent fuel pool. Water containing tritium and strontium-90 was leaking through a crack in the pool building and then finding its way into the nearby Hudson River. Workers were able to keep the spent fuel rods safely covered despite the leak. On March 22, 2006 The New York Times also reported finding radioactive nickel-63 and strontium in groundwater on site. *In 2007, a transformer at Unit 3 caught fire, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission raised its level of inspections, because the plant had experienced many unplanned shut-downs. According to The New York Times, Indian Point \\"has a history of transformer problems\\". *On April 23, 2007, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined the owner of the Indian Point nuclear plant $130,000 for failing to meet a deadline for a new emergency siren plan. The 150 sirens at the plant are meant to alert residents within 10 miles to a plant emergency. *On January 7, 2010, NRC inspectors reported that an estimated 600,000 gallons of mildly radioactive steam was intentionally vented to the atmosphere after an automatic shut-down of Unit 2. After the vent, one of the vent valves unintentionally remained slightly open for two days. The levels of tritium in the steam were within the allowable safety limits defined in NRC standards. *On November 7, 2010, an explosion occurred in a main transformer for Indian Point 2, spilling oil into the Hudson River. Entergy later agreed to pay a $1.2 million penalty for the transformer explosion. *July 2013, a former supervisor, who worked at the Indian Point nuclear power plant for twenty-nine years, was arrested for falsifying the amount of particulate in the diesel fuel for the plant's backup generators. *On May 9, 2015, a transformer failed at Indian Point 3, causing the automated deactivation of reactor 3. A fire that resulted from the failure was extinguished, and the reactor was placed in a safe and stable condition. The failed transformer contained about 24,000 gallons of dielectric fluid, which is used as an insulator and coolant when the transformer is energized. The U.S. Coast Guard estimates that about 3,000 gallons of dielectric fluid entered the river following the failure. *In June 2015, a mylar balloon floated into a switchyard, causing an electrical problem resulting in the deactivation of Reactor 3. *In July 2015, Reactor 3 was shut down after a water pump failure. * On December 5, 2015, Indian Point 2 was shut down after several control rods lost power. * On February 6, 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo informed the public that radioactive tritium- contaminated water leaked into the groundwater at the Indian Point Nuclear facility. = Spent fuel = Indian Point stores used fuel rods in two spent fuel pools at the facility. The spent fuel pools at Indian Point are not stored under a containment dome like the reactor, but rather they are contained within an indoor 40-foot-deep pool and submerged under 27 feet of water. Water is a natural and effective barrier to radiation. The spent fuel pools at Indian Point are set in bedrock and are constructed of concrete walls that are four to six feet wide, with a quarter-inch thick stainless steel inner liner. The pools each have multiple redundant backup cooling systems. Indian Point began dry cask storage of spent fuel rods in 2008, which is a safe and environmentally sound option according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Some rods have already been moved to casks from the spent fuel pools. The pools will be kept nearly full of spent fuel, leaving enough space to allow emptying the reactor completely. Dry cask storage systems are designed to resist floods, tornadoes, projectiles, temperature extremes, and other unusual scenarios. The NRC requires the spent fuel to be cooled and stored in the spent fuel pool for at least five years before being transferred to dry casks. = Earthquake risk = In 2008, researchers from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory located a previously unknown active seismic zone running from Stamford, Connecticut, to the Hudson Valley town of Peekskill, New York‚Äîthe intersection of the Stamford-Peekskill line with the well-known Ramapo Fault‚Äîwhich passes less than a mile north of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. The Ramapo Fault is the longest fault in the North-East, but scientists dispute how active this roughly two-hundred- million-year-old fault really is. Many earthquakes in the state's surprisingly varied seismic history are believed to have occurred on or near it. Visible at ground level, the fault line likely extends as deep as nine miles below the surface. In July 2013, Entergy engineers reassessed the risk of seismic damage to Unit 3 and submitted their findings in a report to the NRC. It was found that risk leading to reactor core damage is 1 in 106,000 reactor years using U.S. Geological Survey data; and 1 in 141,000 reactor years using Electric Power Research Institute data. Unit 3's previous owner, the New York Power Authority, had conducted a more limited analysis in the 1990s than Unit 2's previous owner, Con Edison, leading to the impression that Unit 3 had fewer seismic protections than Unit 2. Neither submission of data from the previous owners was incorrect. According to a company spokesman, Indian Point was built to withstand an earthquake of 6.1 on the Richter scale. Entergy executives have also noted \\"that Indian Point had been designed to withstand an earthquake much stronger than any on record in the region, though not one as powerful as the quake that rocked Japan.\\" The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Indian Point was Reactor 2: 1 in 30,303; Reactor 3: 1 in 10,000, according to an NRC study published in August 2010. Msnbc.com reported based on the NRC data that \\"Indian Point nuclear reactor No. 3 has the highest risk of earthquake damage in the country, according to new NRC risk estimates provided to msnbc.com.\\" According to the report, the reason is that plants in known earthquake zones like California were designed to be more quake-resistant than those in less affected areas like New York. The NRC did not dispute the numbers but responded in a release that \\"The NRC results to date should not be interpreted as definitive estimates of seismic risk,\\" because the NRC does not rank plants by seismic risk. I.P.E.C. Units 2 and 3 both operated at 100% full power before, during, and after the Virginia earthquake on August 23, 2011. A thorough inspection of both units by plant personnel immediately following this event verified no significant damage occurred at either unit. = Emergency planning = The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. According to an analysis of U.S. Census data for MSNBC, the 2010 U.S. population within of Indian Point was 272,539, an increase of 17.6% during the previous ten years. The 2010 U.S. population within was 17,220,895, an increase of 5.1% since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include New York (41 miles to city center); Bridgeport, Conn. (40 miles); Newark, N.J. (39 miles); and Stamford, Conn. (24 miles). In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima incident in Japan, the State Department recommended that any Americans in Japan stay beyond fifty miles from the area. Columnist Peter Applebome, writing in The New York Times, noted that such an area around Indian Point would include \\"almost all of New York City except for Staten Island; almost all of Nassau County and much of Suffolk County; all of Bergen County, N.J.; all of Fairfield, Conn.\\" He quotes Purdue University professor Daniel Aldrich as saying \\"Many scholars have already argued that any evacuation plans shouldn't be called plans, but rather \\"fantasy documents\\"\\". The current ten-mile plume-exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) is one of two EPZs intended to facilitate a strategy for protective action during an emergency and comply with NRC regulations. \\"The exact size and shape of each EPZ is a result of detailed planning which includes consideration of the specific conditions at each site, unique geographical features of the area, and demographic information. This preplanned strategy for an EPZ provides a substantial basis to support activity beyond the planning zone in the extremely unlikely event it would be needed.\\" In an interview, Entergy executives said they doubt that the evacuation zone would be expanded to reach as far as New York City. Indian Point is protected by federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, including a National Guard base within a mile of the facility, as well as by private off-site security forces. During the September 11 attacks, American Airlines Flight 11 flew near the Indian Point Energy Center en route to the World Trade Center. Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers/plotters, had considered nuclear facilities for targeting in a terrorist attack. Entergy says it is prepared for a terrorist attack, and asserts that a large airliner crash into the containment building would not cause reactor damage. Following 9/11 the NRC required operators of nuclear facilities in the U.S. to examine the effects of terrorist events and provide planned responses. In September 2006, the Indian Point Security Department successfully completed mock assault exercises required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. However, according to environmental group Riverkeeper, these NRC exercises are inadequate because they do not envision a sufficiently large group of attackers. According to The New York Times, fuel stored in dry casks is less vulnerable to terrorist attack than fuel in the storage pools.  Recertification  Units 2 and 3 were both originally licensed by the NRC for 40 years of operation. The NRC limits commercial power reactor licenses to an initial 40 years, but also permits such licenses to be renewed. This original 40-year term for reactor licenses was based on economic and antitrust considerations, not on limitations of nuclear technology. Due to this selected period, however, some structures and components may have been engineered on the basis of an expected 40-year service life. The original federal license for Unit Two expired on September 28, 2013, and the license for Unit Three was due to expire in December 2015. On April 30, 2007, Entergy submitted an application for a 20-year renewal of the licenses for both units. On May 2, 2007, the NRC announced that this application is available for public review. Because the owner submitted license renewal applications at least five years prior to the original expiration date, the units are allowed to continue operation past this date while the NRC considers the renewal application. On September 23, 2007, the antinuclear group Friends United for Sustainable Energy (FUSE) filed legal papers with the NRC opposing the relicensing of the Indian Point 2 reactor. The group contended that the NRC improperly held Indian Point to less stringent design requirements. The NRC responded that the newer requirements were put in place after the plant was complete. On December 1, 2007, Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, and New York Governor Eliot Spitzer called a press conference with the participation of environmental advocacy groups Clearwater and Riverkeeper to announce their united opposition to the re-licensing of the Indian Point nuclear power plants. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the Office of the Attorney General requested a hearing as part of the process put forth by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In September 2007 The New York Times reported on the rigorous legal opposition Entergy faces in its request for a 20-year licensing extension for Indian Point Nuclear Reactor 2. A water quality certificate is a prerequisite for a twenty-year renewal by the NRC. On April 3, 2010, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ruled that Indian Point violates the federal Clean Water Act, because \\"the power plant's water-intake system kills nearly a billion aquatic organisms a year, including the shortnose sturgeon, an endangered species.\\" The state is demanding that Entergy constructs new closed-cycle cooling towers at a cost of over $1 billion, a decision that will effectively close the plant for nearly a year. Regulators denied Entergy's request to install fish screens that they said would improve fish mortality more than new cooling towers. Anti-nuclear groups and environmentalists have in the past tried to close the plant, which is in a more densely populated area than any of the 66 other nuclear plant sites in the US. Opposition to the plant increased after the September 2001 terror attacks, when one of the hijacked jets flew close to the plant on its way to the World Trade Center. Public worries also increased after the 2011 Japanese Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and after a report highlighting the Indian Point plant's proximity to the Ramapo Fault. Advocates of recertifying Indian Point include former New York City mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudolph W. Giuliani. Bloomberg says that \\"Indian Point is critical to the city's economic viability\\". The New York Independent System Operator maintains that in the absence of Indian Point, grid voltages would degrade, which would limit the ability to transfer power from upstate New York resources through the Hudson Valley to New York City. As the current governor, Andrew Cuomo continues to call for closure of Indian Point. In late June 2011, a Cuomo advisor in a meeting with Entergy executives informed them for the first time directly of the Governor's intention to close the plant, while the legislature approved a bill to streamline the process of siting replacement plants. Nuclear energy industry figures and analysts responded to Cuomo's initiative by questioning whether replacement electrical plants could be certified and built rapidly enough to replace Indian Point, given New York state's \\"cumbersome regulation process\\", and also noted that replacement power from out of state sources will be hard to obtain because New York has weak ties to generation capacity in other states. They said that possible consequences of closure will be a sharp increase in the cost of electricity for downstate users and even \\"rotating black-outs\\". Several members of the House of Representatives representing districts near the plant have also opposed recertification, including Democrats Nita Lowey, Maurice Hinchey, and Eliot Engel and then Republican member Sue Kelly. In November 2016 the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the application to renew the NRC operating licences must be reviewed against the state's coastal management program, which The New York State Department of State had already decided was inconsistent with coastal management requirements. Entergy has filed a lawsuit regarding the validity of Department of State's decision. Closure Beginning at the end of 2015, Governor Cuomo began to ramp up political action against the Indian Point facility, opening investigations with the state public utility commission, the department of health and the department of environmental conservation. To put the public service commission investigation in perspective, most electric outage investigations conducted by the commission are in response to outages with a known number of affected retail electric customers. By November 17, 2017, the NYISO accepted Indian Point's retirement notice. In January 2017, the governor's office announced closure by 2020-21. The closure, along with pollution control, challenges New York's ability to be supplied. Among the solution proposals are storage, renewables (solar and wind), a new transmission cables from Canada Indian Point replacement options, 2017 and a 650MW natural gas plant located in Wawayanda, New York. There was also a 1,000 MW merchant HVDC transmission line proposed in 2013 to the public service commission that would have interconnected at Athens, New York and Buchanan, New York, however this project was indefinitely stalled when its proposed southern converter station site was bought by the Town of Cortlandt in a land auction administered by Con Edison.NYSPSC DMM Case No. 13-T-0292 As of October 1, 2018, the 650 MW plant built in Wawayanda, New York, by CPV Valley, is operating commercially. The CPV Valley plant has been associated with Governor Cuomo's close aid, Joe Percoco, and the associated corruption trial. Another plant being built, Cricket Valley Energy Center, rated at 1,100 MW, is on schedule to provide energy by 2020 in Dover, New York. An Indian Point contingency plan, initiated in 2012 by the NYSPSC under the administration of Cuomo, solicited energy solutions from which a Transmission Owner Transmission Solutions (TOTS) plan was selected. The TOTS projects provide 450 MW of additional transfer capability across a NYISO defined electric transmission corridor in the form of three projects: series compensation at a station in Marcy, New York, reconductoring a transmission line, adding an additional transmission line, and \\"unbottling\\" Staten Island capacity. These projects, with the exception of part of the Staten Island \\"unbottling\\" were in service by mid-2016. The cost of the TOTS projects are distributed among various utilities in their rate cases before the public service commission and the cost allocation amongst themselves was approved by FERC. NYPA and LIPA are also receiving a portion. The cost of the TOTS projects has been estimated in the range of $27,000,000 to $228,000,000.NYSPSC case no. 12-E-0503 An energy highway initiative was also prompted by this order (generally speaking, additional lines on the Edic-Pleasant Valley and the Oakdale-Fraser transmission corridors) which is still going through the regulatory process in both the NYISO and NYSPSC. Under the current plan, one reactor is scheduled to be shut down in April 2020 and the second by April 2021. A report by the New York Building Congress, a construction industry association, has said that NYC will need additional natural gas pipelines to accommodate the city's increasing demand for energy. Environmentalists have argued that the power provided by Indian point can be replaced by renewable energy, combined with conservation measures and improvements to the efficiency of the electrical grid.

Construction of the base  The town of Oromocto is home of the CFB Gagetown.Oromocto is Accessible and Affordable!At the beginning of the Cold War, Canadian defence planners recognized the need for providing the Canadian Army with a suitable training facility where brigade and division- sized armoured, infantry, and artillery units could exercise in preparation for their role in defending western Europe under Canada's obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty. The facility would need to be located relatively close to an all-season Atlantic port and have suitable railway connections. Existing training facilities dating from the First and Second World Wars in eastern Canada were relatively small (Camp Debert, Camp Aldershot, Sussex Military Camp, Camp Valcartier, Camp Petawawa, Camp Utopia), thus a new facility was considered. At the same time, regional economic development planners saw an opportunity for a military base to benefit the economy of southwestern New Brunswick. The area under consideration was an expansive plateau west of the Saint John River between the cities of Saint John and Fredericton, measuring approximately in length and in width; more accurately it runs between Oromocto in the north to Welsford in the south, and between the Saint John River in the east and the south branch of the Oromocto River in the west.Canadian Forces Base Gagetown Over 900 families inhabited the area primarily engaged in agriculture and forestry industries. The terrain was variable, providing mixed Acadian forest, swamp and marshland, as well as open farming areas similar to the North European Plain. The influence of the St. Croix Highlands, part of the Appalachian Mountain range, creates hilly terrain and valleys in the southern and western part of the region close to the Nerepis and Oromocto Rivers. Bell CH-136 military helicopter at CFB Gagetown The expropriation of lands began in the early 1950s, much to the surprise of local residents who had been kept in the dark about the expropriation until the last minute.Remembering the places that disappeared when CFB Gagetown was born The base was surveyed so as to not affect some of the historic communities along the western bank of the Saint John River such as Gagetown, Hampstead, and Browns Flat; the expropriation began several kilometres west of the river and eliminated the communities of Petersville, Hibernia, New Jerusalem, North Clones and others. This remains the largest single land expropriation in the history of New Brunswick.History: From the days of wooden ships... The base headquarters were chosen for the northern part of the base adjacent to the (then) small village of Oromocto. In preparation for the influx of service personnel, Oromocto was redesigned as a \\"planned\\" town, with buried electrical utilities and residential and commercial clustering typical of larger planned towns such as Richmond Hill, Ontario. Construction of the base facilities in Oromocto benefited from convenient railway connections provided by Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways. A new alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway was built on the eastern bank of the Saint John River, opposite from Oromocto in the early 1960s (see Route 2) and a new highway bridge across the Saint John River connected the Trans-Canada Highway to the village of Burton, just south of Oromocto and near the east gate for the base. The Gagetown Military Camp (or Camp Gagetown) opened in 1956 and was named after the village of Gagetown, although the base was located west of this historic village and was headquartered to its north in Oromocto. The base's territory measured and included numerous live-fire ranges for infantry, armoured, and artillery units, as well as aerial weapons ranges. At the time of its opening in 1956, until the opening of Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area in Australia in 1965, Camp Gagetown was the largest military training facility in the Commonwealth of Nations.

On February 1, 1968, the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Royal Canadian Navy were merged to form the unified Canadian Forces. Following this unification, Camp Gagetown was renamed Canadian Forces Base Gagetown (CFB Gagetown).The Government of Canada‚Äôs terminology and linguistic data bank. In the post- unification armed forces, CFB Gagetown functioned as the primary combat training centre for Force Mobile Command (renamed Land Force Command in the 1990s). In the early 1970s Combat Training Centre Gagetown (CTC Gagetown) was established as a unit at CFB Gagetown comprising armour, artillery, and infantry training schools. In the 1990s the Canadian Forces School of Military Engineering was relocated to CFB Gagetown from CFB Chilliwack. The base is still widely referred to as Camp Gagetown. Increased defence spending in the 1980s saw numerous new training facilities built and ranges modernized, and this continued into the 1990s as the Canadian Forces closed smaller bases in response to further defence budget cuts.

His academic speciality is accountancy law. Cameron is also a Juridical scholar who reflects on the nature of law in relation to the distinctives of the New Zealand legal tradition and the wider legal developments around the world. He is a critical proponent of the Juridical philosophy developed by past professor of law at the Free University in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Dr Herman Dooyeweerd. Dooyeweerd's overall conception is often referred to as the philosophy of the law-idea (Dutch: Wijsbegeerte der Wetsidee - \\"WdW,\\" a nickname pronounced \\"vay de vay). Although his 5-volume major work in jurisprudence is only now in the process of being published, with the appearance of Volume I of Encyclopedia of the Science of Law , the ideas Dooyeweerd taught during his professorship in jurisprudence have been in circulation in the English-speaking world since 1953, when Dooyeweerd's first volume of A New Critique of Theoretical Thought appeared. This broader philosophical work establishes a context for both the juridical philosophy, and the various nationally-distinctive bodies of juridical scholarship. Dooyeweerd's colleague, professor of philosophy and co- founder with Dooyeweerd of Reformational philosophy, D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, distinguishes \\"three senses of ‚Äòlaw‚Äô: structural law, inherent in the cosmos; the imposed or proclaimed law of love, as the message of the Gospel in which Christ summarizes the teaching of Moses and the Prophets; and the positive laws, enacted from out of positions of responsibility, in which a situation is given more definite form, in accordance to the norming law of love, in the context of actual geographical and historical exigencies. In this last development, history is taken in the sense of encompassing the entire cosmos. There are successive emphases here, first to ‚ÄòGod‚Äô, then to ‚ÄòLaw‚Äô, then to ‚ÄòCosmos‚Äô. With each step the meaning of all three is deepened,\\" says Dr Anthony Tol.  References  *Dooyeweerd, Herman.

Situations other than consecutive fifths create contrasting melodic lines, melodies that are different from each other. Consecutive fifths by contrary motion are generally avoided, meaning parallels may not be corrected by moving one part up or down an octave.Kostka & Payne (1995). Tonal Harmony, p.85. Third Edition. . Hidden [consecutive] fifths: to .Benward & Saker (2003). Music in Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.155. . & In music, consecutive fifths, or parallel fifths, are progressions in which the interval of a perfect fifth is followed by a different perfect fifth between the same two musical parts (or voices): for example, from C to D in one part along with G to A in a higher part. Octave displacement is irrelevant to this aspect of musical grammar; for example, parallel twelfths (i.e. an octave plus a fifth) are equivalent to parallel fifths.Thus, the word \\"parallel\\" is not truly synonymous with \\"consecutive\\" here, as a fifth followed by another fifth approached with contrary motion would still count as consecutive fifths. The term parallel fifths may therefore be misleading, because some consecutive fifths occur with contrary motion: from a true uncompounded fifth to a twelfth, for example. If parts move by oblique motion (for example, one part moving from a C to a higher C, and another part repeating a G higher than both of those Cs), the intervals are not considered to differ in the relevant way, so parallel fifths do not occur. Though used in, and evocative of, various kinds of popular, folk, and medieval music, parallel motion in perfect consonances (P1, P5, P8) is strictly forbidden in species counterpoint instruction (1725‚Äìpresent) and during the common practice period, consecutive fifths were strongly discouraged. This was primarily due to the notion of voice leading in tonal music, in which, \\"one of the basic goals...is to maintain the relative independence of the individual parts.\\"Kostka & Payne (1995), p.84. The perfect intervals (the 4th, 5th and octave) sound 'pure'. A common theory is that the presence of the 3rd harmonic of the harmonic series influenced the creation of the prohibition. Development of the prohibition Singing in consecutive fifths may have originated from the accidental singing of a chant a perfect fifth above (or a perfect fourth below) the proper pitch. Whatever its origin, singing in parallel fifths became commonplace in early organum and conductus styles. Around 1300, Johannes de Garlandia became the first theorist to prohibit the practice.Optima introductio in contrapunctum, c1300; Coussemaker, Edmond (1876), Scriptores de musica medii aevi, Vol. III, 12; as cited in Drabkin, William. \\"Consecutive fifths, consecutive octaves.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. However, parallel fifths were still common in 14th-century music. The early 15th- century composer Leonel Power likewise forbade the motion of \\"2 acordis perfite of one kynde, as 2 unisouns, 2 5ths, 2 8ths, 2 12ths, 2 15ths,\\" and it is with the transition to Renaissance-style counterpoint that the use of parallel perfect consonances was consistently avoided in practice. The convention dates approximately from 1450. Composers avoided writing consecutive fifths between two independent parts, such as tenor and bass lines. Consecutive fifths were usually considered forbidden, even if disguised (such as in a \\"horn fifth\\") or broken up by an intervening note (such as the mediant in a triad). The interval may form part of a chord of any number of notes, and may be set well apart from the rest of the harmony, or finely interwoven in its midst. But the interval was always to be quit [followed?] by any movement that did not land on another fifth. The prohibition concerning fifths did not just apply to perfect fifths. Some theorists objected also to the progression from a perfect fifth to a diminished fifth in parallel motion; for example the progression from C and G to B and F (B and F forming a diminished fifth). \\"The reason for avoiding parallel 5ths and 8ves has to do with the nature of counterpoint. The P8 and P5 are the most stable of intervals, and to link two voices through parallel motion at such intervals interferes with their independence much more than would parallel motion at 3rds or 6ths.\\" \\"Since the octave really represents a repetition of the same tone in a different register, if two or more octaves occur in succession, the result is a reduction in the number of voices; for example, in a two-voice setting, one of the voices would temporarily disappear, and along with it the rationale of the intended two-voice setting. The octave acts merely as a doubling; if, in a particular instance, it is not intended to act as such, this must be sufficiently emphasized by what precedes and follows it. But even the succession of two octaves brings the sense of doubling into the foreground. Of course, this must not be confused with an intentional doubling used to strengthen sonority, for which, however, strict counterpoint offers no motivation.\\"Jonas, Oswald (1982). Introduction to the Theory of Heinrich Schenker, p.110. (1934: Das Wesen des musikalischen Kunstwerks: Eine Einf√ºhrung in Die Lehre Heinrich Schenkers). Trans. John Rothgeb. . Similarly, \\"Parallel 8ves...reduce the number of voices...since the voice that [momentarily] doubles at the 8ve...is not an independent voice but merely a duplication. Parallel 8ves...may also confuse the functions of the voices...If the upper voice succession...is merely a duplication of the bass, then the actual soprano must be...the alto voice. This interpretation of course makes no sense, for it turns the texture inside out.\\"Forte, Allen (1979). Tonal Harmony in Concept & Practice, p.50. Third edition. . \\"Parallel 5ths are avoided because the 5th, formed by scale degrees 1 and 5, is the primary harmonic interval, the interval that divides the scale and thus defines the key. The direct succession of two 5ths raises doubt concerning the key.\\" Power chords in progression create parallel fifths, though the prohibition is not relevant since there is no intention to create independent voices. The identification and avoidance of perfect fifths in the instruction of counterpoint and harmony help to distinguish the more formal idiom of classical music from popular and folk musics, in which consecutive fifths commonly appear in the form of double tonics and shifts of level. The prohibition of consecutive fifths in European classical music originates not only in the requirement for contrary motion in counterpoint but in a gradual and eventually self-conscious attempt to distance classical music from folk traditions. As Sir Donald Tovey explains in his discussion of Joseph Haydn's Symphony no. 88, \\"The trio is one of Haydn's finest pieces of rustic dance music, with hurdy-gurdy drones which shift in disregard of the rule forbidding consecutive fifths. The disregard is justified by the fact that the essential objection to consecutive fifths is that they produce the effect of shifting hurdy-gurdy drones.\\"Tovey, Donald Francis. Essays in musical analysis, vol. 1, p. 142. Quoted in van der Merwe, Peter (1989). Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music, p. 210\\\\. Oxford: Clarendon Press. . A more contemporary example would be guitar power chords. In the course of the 19th century consecutive fifths became more common, arising out of new textures and new conceptions of propriety in voice leading generally. They even became a stylistic feature in the work of some composers, notably Chopin; and with the early 20th century and the breakdown of common-practice norms the prohibition became less and less relevant.Piston, Walter (1987). Harmony, 5th edition revised DeVoto, Mark, pp. 309‚Äì312, 477‚Äì480. . Related progressionsUnequal fifths= Unequal fifths, motion between perfect and diminished fifths is often avoided, with some avoiding only motion one way (diminished to perfect fifth or perfect to diminished fifth) or only if the bass is involved. Notice that unequal fifths resemble similar rather than parallel motion, since the perfect fifth is seven semitones and the diminished fifth is six semitones. =Parallel octaves and fourths= Sousa's \\"Washington Post March,\\" bars 1‚Äì7 features octave doubling.Benward & Saker (2003). Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I, p.133. Seventh Edition. . Prohibition does not apply as the parts are not independent, octaves are not parallel but doubled. Consecutive fifths are avoided in part because they cause a loss of individuality between parts. This lack of individuality is even more pronounced when parts move in parallel octaves or in unison. These are therefore also generally forbidden among independently moving parts.The restriction to independently moving parts is important. It has always been standard to double a part in unison or at the octave, even at several different octaves simultaneously, for the duration of a phrase or beyond. For contrapuntal and harmonic analysis this does not add new parts at all. By convention, common practice sometimes allows more transient parallel octaves, or even fifths, with certain melodic embellishments such as anticipations.(Piston 1987, pp. 306‚Äì312.) Parallel fourths (consecutive perfect fourths) are allowed, even though a P4 is the inversion and thus the complement of a P5. The literature deals with them less systematically however, and theorists have often restricted their use. Theorists commonly disallow consecutive perfect fourths involving the lowest part, especially between the lowest part and the highest part. Since the beginning of the common practice period, it has been theorized that all dissonances should be properly resolved to a perfect consonance (there are few exceptions). Therefore, parallel fourths above the bass are generally dismissed in voice leading as a series of consecutive unresolved dissonances. However parallel fourths in upper voices (especially as part of a parallel \\"6-3\\" sonority) are common, and formed the basis of fifteenth-century fauxbourdon style. As an example of this type of allowed parallel perfect fourth in common practice music, see the final movement of Mozart's A minor Piano sonata whose theme in bars 37‚Äì40 consists of parallel fourths in the right hand part (but not above the bass). =Hidden consecutives= Horn fifths: both notes in the interval are approached in similar motion from below. So-called hidden consecutives, also called direct or covered octaves or fifths,Piston (1987), p. 32.The traditional terms for these progressions are as vague and variable as the traditional rules that govern them. occur when two independent parts approach a single perfect fifth or octave by similar motion instead of oblique or contrary motion. A single fifth or octave approached this way is sometimes called an exposed fifth or exposed octave. Conventional style dictates that such a progression be avoided; but it is sometimes permitted under certain conditions, such as the following: the interval does not involve either the highest or the lowest part, the interval does not occur between both of those extreme parts, the interval is approached in one part by a semitone step, or the interval is approached in the higher part by step. The details differ considerably from period to period, and even among composers writing in the same period. An important acceptable case of hidden fifths in the common practice period are horn fifths. Horn fifths arise from the limitation of valveless brass instruments to the notes of the harmonic series (hence their name). In all but their extreme high registers, these brass instruments are limited to the notes of the major triad. The typical two-instrument configuration would have the high instrument playing a scalar melody against a lower instrument confined to the notes of the tonic chord. Horn fifths occur when the upper voice is on the first three scale degrees. Traditional horn fifths actually come in pairs. Begin with the upper instrument on the third scale degree and the lower instrument on the tonic. Then move the upper instrument to the second scale degree and the second instrument down to the fifth scale degree. Because the distance from 5 up to 2 is a perfect fifth, we have just created a hidden fifth by descending motion. The first instrument can then complete its descent to 1 as the lower instrument moves to 3. The second hidden fifth of the pair is obtained by making the upward maneuver a mirror image of the downward maneuver. These direct fifths are preferable to other less acceptable voice-leading alternatives including doubling the third scale degree at the octave, and limiting the low instrument to the use of only the first and fifth scale degrees. Although traditional horn fifths come in pairs and in passing, the acceptability of horn fifths has been generalized to any situation of hidden fifths where the top voice moves by step. Special uses and exceptions in early music Consecutive fifths are typically used to evoke the sound of music in medieval times or exotic places. The use of parallel fifths (or fourths) to refer to the sound of traditional Chinese or other kinds of Eastern music was once commonplace in film scores and songs. Since these passages are an obvious oversimplification and parody of the styles that they seek to evoke, this use of parallel fifths declined during the last half of the 20th century. In the medieval period, large church organs and positive organs would often be permanently arranged for each single key to speak in a consecutive fifth. It is believed this practice dates to Roman times. A positive organ having this configuration has been reconstructed recently by Van der Putten and is housed in Groningen, and is used in an attempt to rediscover performance practice of the time. In Iceland, the traditional song style known as tv√≠s√∂ngur, \\"twin-singing\\", goes back to the Middle Ages and is still taught in schools today. In this style, a melody is sung against itself, typically in parallel fifths. Georgian music frequently uses parallel fifths, and sometimes parallel major ninths above the fifths. This means that there are two sets of parallel fifths, one directly on top of the other. This is especially prominent in the sacred music of the Guria region, in which the pieces are sung a cappella by men. It is believed that this harmonic style dates from pre-Christian times. Consecutive fifths (as well as fourths and octaves) are commonly used to mimic the sound of Gregorian plainsong. This practice is well-founded in early European musical traditions. Plainsong was originally sung in unison, not in fifths, but by the ninth century there is evidence that singing in parallel intervals (fifths, octaves, and fourths) commonly ornamented the performance of chant. This is documented in the anonymous ninth-century theory treatises known as Musica enchiriadis and its commentary Scolica enchiriadis. These treatises use Daseian music notation, based on four-note patterns called tetrachords, which easily notates parallel fifths. This notation predates Guido of Arezzo's solmization, which divides the scale into six-note patterns called hexachords, and the modern octave-based staff notation into which Guido's gamut evolved. Mozart fifths Parallel fifths from German sixth resolution in Mozart's Symphony K.543.Ellis, Mark R. (2010). A Chord in Time: The Evolution of the Augmented Sixth Sonority from Monteverdi to Mahler, p.5. . In Brahms's essay \\"Octaven und Quinten\\" (\\"Octaves and fifths\\"), he identifies many cases of apparent consecutive fifths in the works of Mozart. Most of the examples he provides involve accompaniment figuration in small note values that moves in parallel fifths with a slower moving bass. The background voice-leading of such progressions is oblique motion, with the consecutive fifths resulting from the ornamentation of the sustaining voice with a chromatic lower neighbor. Such \\"Mozart fifths\\" occur in bars 254‚Äì255 of the Act I finale of Cos√¨ fan Tutte, in bar 80 of the Act II sextet from Don Giovanni, in the opening of the last movement of the Violin Sonata in A Major, K. 526 and in bar 189 of the overture to Zauberfl√∂te. Another use of the term \\"Mozart fifths\\" results from the non-standard resolution of the German augmented sixth chord that Mozart used occasionally, such as in the retransition of the finale of the Jupiter Symphony (bars 221‚Äì222, second bassoon and basses), in the Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448 (third movement, bars 276‚Äì277 (second piano)), and in the example at the right from Symphony No. 39 (Mozart). Mozart (and all common-practice composers) almost always resolves German augmented sixth chords to cadential chords to avoid these fifths. The Jupiter example is unique in that Mozart spells the fifth enharmonically (A/D to G/D) as a result of the progression arising from a B-major harmony (presented as a dominant of e-minor). Theorists have tried to make the case that this resolution of the augmented sixth chord is more frequently acceptable. \\"The parallel fifths [in the German sixth] arising from the natural progression to the dominant are always considered acceptable, except when occurring between soprano and bass. They are most often seen between tenor and bass. The third degree is, however, frequently tied over as a suspension, or repeated as an appoggiatura, before continuing down to the second degree\\".Piston (1987), p. 422. However, seeing as the vast majority of German augmented sixth chords in common-practice works resolve to cadential six-four chords to avoid parallel fifths, it can be concluded that common-practice composers deemed these fifths undesirable in most situations.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, and utilized a fastball, a slider, and a changeup for his pitches. In a 14-season career, Lieber compiled a 131‚Äì124 record with 1,553 strikeouts and a 4.27 ERA in 2,198 innings pitched. Lieber attended the University of South Alabama, helping them win the Sun Belt Conference Championship. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the second round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, but he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates the following season before even throwing a pitch in the major leagues. He made his debut in 1994 and was named the Pirates' Opening Day starter in 1995, but it was not until 1997 that he became a full-time major league starter. He was traded to the Chicago Cubs following the 1998 season. In 2000, he led the National League (NL) with 251 innings pitched. He had his best season in 2001, winning 20 games while losing just six. Lieber underwent Tommy John surgery in 2002 and missed the entire 2003 season. In 2004, he pitched for the New York Yankees, reaching the playoffs for the only time in his career. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2005 and tied for fifth in the NL with 17 wins. Injuries cut into his playing time over the next three years; he finished his career as a reliever with the Cubs in 2008. BiographyEarly life= Lieber was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa. He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs in 1988. Lieber initially attended Iowa Western Community College in 1989 and 1990 before transferring to the University of South Alabama. Over the next two years, Lieber experienced great success for South Alabama. He posted 12-5 records for them both of his years there, and he led the team in earned run average (ERA) and strikeouts both years. He was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the ninth round of the 1991 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, but he did not sign. In 1992, he helped South Alabama win the Sun Belt Conference Championship. Lieber received several honors following his senior season. These included the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year award, a third-team All-America selection by the American Baseball Coaches Association, an all-region award, and an all- league award (his second). In 2013, he was inducted into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the second round of the 1992 draft, and this time, he signed. =Minor Leagues (1992‚Äì94)= Lieber began his professional career with the A short season Eugene Emeralds of the Northwest League. In five starts with the Emeralds, he had a 3-0 record, a 1.16 ERA, 23 strikeouts, 2 walks, and 26 hits allowed in 31 innings pitched. He also appeared in seven games (six starts) for the Baseball City Royals of the A-Advanced Florida State League, posting a 3-3 record, a 4.65 ERA, 19 strikeouts, eight walks, and 45 hits allowed in 31 innings pitched. In 1993, the Royals switched their A-Advanced affiliate to the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Carolina League. Lieber began the season with Wilmington, posting a 9-3 record, a 2.67 ERA, 89 strikeouts, nine walks, 125 hits allowed, and innings pitched in 17 games (16 starts). He was promoted to the AA Memphis Chicks of the Southern League on July 11, where he posted a 2-1 record and a 6.86 ERA in four starts. On July 31, seeking pitching help as they contended for the playoffs, the Royals traded Lieber and Dan Miceli to the Pittsburgh Pirates for their closer, Stan Belinda. The Pirates assigned Lieber to the Southern League's Carolina Mudcats; in six starts, he had a 4-2 record, a 3.97 ERA, 28 strikeouts, 10 walks, and 39 hits allowed in 34 innings pitched. Lieber made three starts with the Mudcats in 1994, posting a 2-0 record, a 1.29 ERA, 21 strikeouts, two walks, and 13 hits allowed in 21 innings. He also made three starts for the Buffalo Bisons of the Triple-A American Association, posting a 1-1 record, a 1.69 ERA, 21 strikeouts, one walk, and 16 hits allowed in innings pitched. =Pittsburgh Pirates (1994‚Äì98)= Lieber was called up by the Pirates in May 1994 to join their starting rotation. In his first major league start on May 15, he gave up one run in six innings but took the loss as the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Pirates 1-0. He earned his first career win five days later, pitching eight shutout innings in a 6-0 victory over the Montreal Expos. In 17 starts with the Pirates, Lieber had a 6-7 record, a 3.73 ERA, 71 strikeouts, 25 walks, and 116 hits allowed in innings. Following Lieber's rookie season, Pirates' manager Jim Leyland named Lieber the team's Opening Day starter for 1995. Like many of the young Pirates' pitchers that year, Lieber struggled; he was optioned to the Calgary Cannons of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League on June 18 after going 2-7 with a 7.48 ERA. In 14 starts with Calgary, Lieber had a 1-5 record, a 7.01 ERA, 34 strikeouts, 19 walks, and 122 hits allowed in 77 innings pitched. He was recalled by the Pirates on September 5 when rosters expanded but was used mostly as a relief pitcher for the rest of the year. In 21 games (12 starts), Lieber compiled a 4-7 record, a 6.32 ERA, 45 strikeouts, 14 walks, and 103 hits allowed in innings pitched. Lieber remained in the bullpen to begin the 1996 season. In his first 34 games, he posted a 4.21 ERA. In July, he returned to the starting rotation following the release of Zane Smith. As a starter, Lieber posted a 7-2 record with a 3.91 ERA, emerging as the Pirates' ace by the end of the year. In 51 games (15 starts) in 1996, Lieber posted a 9-5 record, a 3.99 ERA, 94 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 156 hits allowed in 142 innings pitched. Lieber became the Pirates' Opening Day starter again in 1997. On June 30, he threw his only complete game of the year, striking out 10 while allowing one run on five hits in a 3-1 victory over the Chicago White Sox. Lieber was inconsistent in 1997, amassing several winning streaks and several losing streaks during the season. In 33 games (32 starts), he had an 11-14 record, a 4.49 ERA, 160 strikeouts, 51 walks, and 193 hits allowed in innings pitched. He was third in the NL in losses (behind Mark Leiter's 17 and teammate Steve Cooke's 15); however, he tied Mike Hampton for the most runs batted in by a major league pitcher with eight. In 1998, Lieber was the Pirates' fourth starter. He had a 5-10 record over his first 17 starts, partly because he received 15 total runs of support in the losses over that time. Lieber had an 8-13 record with a 3.90 ERA before getting placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career on August 21 due to a left oblique muscle strain. He returned from the DL on September 15 but posted a 10.80 ERA over his last two starts. In 29 games (28 starts), Lieber posted an 8-14 record, a 4.11 ERA, 138 strikeouts, 40 walks, and 182 hits allowed in 171 innings pitched. He was tied with seven other pitchers for fifth in the league in losses. Following the season, Lieber was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Brant Brown. =Chicago Cubs (1999‚Äì2002)= Lieber began 1999 as the Cubs' third starter. Prior to the All-Star break, he had an 8-3 record with a 3.26 ERA (seventh-best in the NL). From April 29 to May 8, he was on the DL with a right eye contusion. He threw his first major league shutout on May 14, striking out seven in a 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves. Lieber went 0-8 with a 5.71 ERA in his first 13 starts following the All-Star Break before earning wins in his final two starts of the year. In 31 starts, Lieber compiled a 10-11 record, a 4.07 ERA, and 46 walks in innings pitched. He was tied for tenth in the league with 226 hits allowed (along with teammate Steve Trachsel), but he finished eighth in the league with 186 strikeouts and tied with six other players for ninth in the league with three complete games. In 2000, Lieber was the Cubs' Opening Day starter. From June 28 to August 14, he won a career-high six consecutive decisions. On July 3, he threw a shutout, allowing two hits in a 3-0 victory over the Pirates. In his next start, on July 8, he had 12 strikeouts and threw a complete game in a 9-2 win over the White Sox. Lieber was 12-7 with a 4.12 ERA through his first 29 starts; however, he went 0-4 in September with a 5.88 ERA. In 35 starts (tied for the NL lead with Randy Johnson, Kevin Millwood, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux), Lieber had a 12-11 record, a 4.41 ERA, and 54 walks. He tied Darryl Kile for ninth in the league with 192 strikeouts, he led the league with 251 innings pitched, he ranked third in the league with 248 hits allowed (behind Liv√°n Hern√°ndez's 254 and Jos√© Lima's 251), and he tied Maddux for third with six complete games (behind Johnson's and Curt Schilling's eight). Lieber's most productive season came in 2001. On May 24, he one-hit the Cincinnati Reds, 3‚Äì0, ending the team's NL-record streak of 208 games in a row without being shut out, throwing just 78 pitches. From June 16 to July 15, he won six straight games. He was named an All-Star for the first and only time in his career. In his final start of the season on October 3, he allowed five runs in six innings but still earned his 20th win of the season as the Cubs beat the Reds 13-7. In 34 starts, Lieber recorded a career-high 20 victories to go with just six losses, posted a 3.80 ERA, and struck out 148 as opposed to 41 walks. His 20 wins ranked fourth in the league (behind Matt Morris's and Schilling's 22 and Johnson's 21), his innings pitched ranked fifth in the league, and his five complete games tied for second in the league with Javier V√°zquez (behind Johnson's six). He finished fourth in the NL Cy Young Award vote, behind Johnson, Schilling, and Morris. Due to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 and the week-long break in the baseball season, Lieber became the first Cubs pitcher to start consecutive contests since Scott Sanderson on May 18 and May 20 of 1986. Lieber's 2002 season was curtailed by right elbow problems, which plagued him all year. On August 1, facing the San Diego Padres, Lieber allowed two runs in seven innings but received a no-decision in an 8-7 Cubs' victory. He was placed on the DL with right elbow tendinitis the next day, and he underwent Tommy John surgery on August 8, ending his season. In 21 starts, Lieber compiled a 6-8 record, a 3.70 ERA, 87 strikeouts, 12 walks, and 153 hits allowed in 141 innings pitched. He still managed to tie Randy Wolf, Brett Tomko, Pedro Astacio, and teammate Matt Clement for tenth in the league with three complete games. After the season, he became a free agent. While on the Cubs, Lieber became the only Major League pitcher to give up a hit to a one handed player when he gave up not just one hit, but two to Jim Abbott, also allowing Abbott to drive in three RBIs. =Other teams (2004‚Äì08)= Lieber signed a two-year contract with the New York Yankees following the 2002 season. He missed the 2003 season recovering from his injury, although he did make two minor league rehab appearances. Lieber began the 2004 season on the DL with a strained abductor muscle in his right thigh. He returned to the major leagues on May 1, allowing three runs in seven innings in a 12-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Through August 1, he had a 7-7 record with a 5.06 ERA. From then on, Lieber went 7-1 with a 3.21 ERA. On September 18, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Boston Red Sox and allowed three runs in innings in a 14-4 victory. In 27 starts, Lieber posted a 14-8 record, a 4.33 ERA, 102 strikeouts, 18 walks, and 216 hits allowed in innings pitched. His 14 wins tied with eight other pitchers for eighth in the American League (AL) and tied with Javier V√°zquez for the most by a Yankee as well as being the largest win total by an ex-20 game winner returning from a full-season layoff since 1946. Dave Caldwell of the New York Times wrote on September 3 that Lieber would \\"probably end up in the bullpen\\" in the playoffs, but less than a month later, Mark Feinsand of MLB.com wrote that Lieber \\"has suddenly become one of the most important cogs in the Yankees' postseason machine\\" due an injury to Kevin Brown and late-season struggles by V√°zquez. Lieber started Game 2 of the AL Division Series against the Minnesota Twins. He allowed three runs over innings and was in line for the win, but he received a no-decision in a 12-inning, 7-6 Yankee victory. The Yankees won the series in four games. In Game 2 of the AL Championship Series against the Red Sox, Lieber allowed one run and three hits in seven innings, earning the win in a 3-1 victory. In Game 6, he allowed four runs in innings and took the loss in a 4-2 defeat. The Red Sox become the first MLB team in history to overcome a 3‚Äì0 series deficit, winning in seven games. 2004 would be Lieber's only playoff experience, as well as his only stint in the AL. Lieber with the Phillies Before the 2005 season, Lieber signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies for three years and $24 million with a team option for the fourth year. He was named the Phillies' Opening Day starter in 2005. He won his first four starts with the team. From May 12 through June 30, Lieber had a 3-7 record and a 7.48 ERA. 8-8 by the end of that stretch, he managed to post a 9-5 record and a 3.32 ERA to finish the season. Lieber gave up one run in eight innings on July 21 but took the loss as the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Phillies 1-0. On September 22, he threw eight shutout innings in a 4-0 victory over the Braves. Lieber finished the season with a 17-13 record, a 4.20 ERA, 149 strikeouts, 41 walks, and 223 hits allowed in innings pitched. Lieber led the team with 17 wins, which tied with Andy Pettitte for fifth in the league. He tied with six other pitchers for the league lead with 35 starts. Lieber lost his first four starts of the season in 2006 for the first time in his career. On May 13, he took a perfect game into the seventh inning against Cincinnati before allowing a two- out single to Adam Dunn; he threw scoreless innings in a 2-0 victory. He was on the DL from May 30 to July 6 with a groin injury. Before going on the DL, he had a 3-5 record and a 5.79 ERA. He posted a 6.75 ERA in his first five starts after returning from the DL, but he posted a 3.38 in his final 11 starts. On August 16, he threw his first shutout since 2001 against the New York Mets, allowing five hits in a 3-0 victory. In 27 starts, Lieber compiled a 9-11 record, a 4.93 ERA, 100 strikeouts, 24 walks, and 196 hits allowed in 168 innings pitched. Lieber began 2007 on the DL with a strained right oblique, and when he was activated on April 9, he was placed in the bullpen. After two relief outings, he returned to the rotation on April 20 when Brett Myers was moved to the bullpen. On June 9, he struck out 11 and allowed three hits in a 4-0 shutout of the Royals. At the time, he was 3-4 with a 3.72 ERA, but he allowed 14 runs (13 earned) over his next two starts, both losses. On June 23, Lieber was placed on the DL with a ruptured tendon in his right foot, which ended his tenure with the Phillies. In 14 games (12 starts), he had a 3-6 record, a 4.73 ERA, 54 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 91 hits allowed in 78 innings. The Phillies reached the playoffs, but Lieber was left off their postseason roster because of his injury. On January 16, 2008, Lieber signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Cubs. He competed for the starting rotation but failed to earn a spot and was placed in the bullpen as the Cubs' long reliever. From July 18 to September 1, he was on the DL with a right foot injury. He appeared in his final major league game on September 5, giving up four runs in two innings in a 10-2 loss to Cincinnati. In 26 games (one start), Lieber posted a 2-3 record, a 4.05 ERA, 27 strikeouts, six walks, and 59 hits allowed in innings pitched. The Cubs reached the playoffs, but Lieber was left off the playoff roster for the second year in a row. Lieber retired after the 2008 season to spend more time with his family. In his 14-year career, Lieber had a 131-124 record, a 4.27 ERA, 1,553 strikeouts, 422 walks, 2,388 hits allowed, and 2,198 innings pitched in 401 games (327 starts). His strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.680 ranks 23rd all-time among major league pitchers as of 2020. Pitching style Lieber threw three pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a changeup. The slider was the pitch Lieber often used to get outs and was most successful against right-handed batters. The changeup darted away from batters. Lieber was not a hard thrower (his fastball was in the low 90 mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success. Personal life Lieber married Jessica Conway on October 18, 1992. The couple has one daughter: Jillian (born October 22, 1997), and three sons: Jared (born July 27, 2000), Justin (born May 8, 2003), and Jonah (born June 1, 2007). They live in Mobile, Alabama. Lieber enjoys hunting as a hobby.

He was given an allowance from his father to become a gentleman naturalist rather than a clergyman, and his first tasks were to find suitable experts to describe his collections, write out his Journal and Remarks, and present papers on his findings to the Geological Society of London. At Darwin's geological d√©but, the anatomist Richard Owen's reports on the fossils showed that extinct species were related to current species in the same locality, and the ornithologist John Gould showed that bird specimens from the Gal√°pagos Islands were of distinct species related to places, not just varieties. These points convinced Darwin that transmutation of species must be occurring, and in his Red Notebook he jotted down his first evolutionary ideas. He began specific transmutation notebooks with speculations on variation in offspring \\"to adapt & alter the race to changing world\\", and sketched an \\"irregularly branched\\" genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree. Animal observations of an orangutan at the zoo showed how human its expressions looked, confirming his thoughts from the Beagle voyage that there was little gulf between man and animals. He investigated animal breeding and found parallels to nature removing runts and keeping the fit, with farmers deliberately selecting breeding animals so that through \\"a thousand intermediate forms\\" their descendants were significantly changed. His speculations on instincts and mental traits suggested habits, beliefs and facial expressions having evolved, and considered the social implications. While this was his \\"prime hobby\\", he was struggling with an immense workload and began suffering from his illness. Having taken a break from work, his thoughts of marriage turned to his cousin Emma Wedgwood. Reading about Malthus and natural law led him to apply to his search the Malthusian logic of social thinking of struggle for survival with no handouts, and he \\"had at last got a theory by which to work\\". He proposed to Emma, and was accepted. In his theory, he compared breeders selecting traits to natural selection from variants thrown up by \\"chance\\", and continued to look to the countryside for supporting information. On 24 January 1839 he was elected as Fellow of the Royal Society, and on the 29th married Emma. The development of Darwin's theory followed. Background Darwin was not the first to propose that species of organisms could become modified over time. In the third edition of On the Origin of Species Darwin provided a historical sketch of his predecessors in writing of descent with modification or natural selection, including those whom he had only learned of after the 1859 publication of The Origin. His account essentially deals with 19th-century authors; \\"Passing over authors from the classical period to that of Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar, Lamarck was the first man whose conclusions on this subject excited much attention.\\" However, in a footnote he remarks on how his grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, Goethe and Geoffroy Saint Hilaire came to the same conclusion on the origin of species in the years 1794‚Äì95, anticipating Lamarck. After his early life in a Unitarian family, Charles Darwin developed his interest in natural history. At Edinburgh University his work as a student of Robert Edmund Grant involved him in pioneering investigations of the ideas of Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin on homology showing common descent, but he also saw how controversial and troubling such theories were. Robert Jameson's course taught Darwin stratigraphic geology, and closed with lectures on the \\"Origin of the Species of Animals\\". At Christ's College, Cambridge to qualify as an Anglican clergyman, Darwin became passionate about beetle collecting, then shone in John Stevens Henslow's botany course. He was convinced by Paley's Natural Theology which set out the Teleological argument that complexity of \\"design\\" in nature proved God's role as Creator, and by the views of Paley and John Herschel that creation was by laws which science could discover, not by intermittent miracles. The geology course of Adam Sedgwick and summer work mapping strata in Wales emphasised that life on earth went back over eons of time. Then on his voyage on the Beagle Darwin became convinced by Charles Lyell's uniformitarian theory of gradual geological process, and puzzled over how various theories of creation fitted the evidence he saw. However, Darwin did not conceive the theory of evolution during the Beagles voyage, later recounting that: > it was equally evident that neither the action of the surrounding > conditions, nor the will of the organisms (especially in the case of > plants), could account for the innumerable cases in which organisms of every > kind are beautifully adapted to their habitats of life‚Äîfor instance, a > woodpecker or a tree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks > or plumes. I had always been much struck by such adaptations, and until > these could be explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to > prove by indirect evidence that species have been modified. Return to England When the Beagle returned, it anchored at Falmouth, Cornwall, on 2 October 1836. That same stormy night, Darwin set off on the mail coach and arrived at his family home‚ÄîThe Mount House in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, late at night on 4 October. He went straight to bed, then greeted his family at breakfast and began catching up with news of his family and of the country: \\"all England appears changed\\". The Reform Bill had brought what the Tory Duke of Wellington described as a shift in power from decent Tory Anglicans to Whig manufacturers, shopkeepers and atheists. Educated people were discussing the writings of Thomas Malthus on population outstripping resources as the New Poor Law, described by opponents as \\"a Malthusian bill designed to force the poor to emigrate, to work for lower wages, to live on a coarser sort of food\\", brought the construction of workhouses in the southern counties despite riots and arson. The government had not yet dared introduce these measures to London and the industrial north, and recession was bringing threats of mass unemployment. Darwin wrote to Henslow that he was still \\"giddy with joy & confusion... I want your advice on so many points, indeed I am in the clouds\\" and on 15 October went on to Cambridge to get advice from Henslow and Sedgwick on the task of organising the description and cataloguing of his collections accumulated from the Beagle expedition. Henslow took on the plants, and Darwin was given introductions to the best London naturalists with a warning that they would already be busy with other work. Charles went on to stay with his brother Erasmus in London, near the scientific institutions which were in the throes of renovation, while the city itself was being torn up to install new sewers and gas lighting. He went round the British Museum, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Linnean, the Zoological Society and Geological Society, trying to get the experts to take on his collections. Henslow had already established his former pupil's reputation during the Beagle expedition by giving selected naturalists access to fossil specimens sent back as well as having Darwin's geological writings privately printed for distribution. Darwin went \\"in most exciting dissipation amongst the Dons in science\\", and as Charles Bunbury reported, \\"[he] seems to be a universal collector\\" finding new species \\"to the surprise of all the big wigs\\". While geologists were quick to take on the rock samples, zoologists already had more specimens arriving than they could deal with. Their institutions were in turmoil as democrats argued for reforms replacing the aristocratic amateurs with professional salaried scientists as in the French research institutes. At the Zoological Society the reformers were led by Darwin's tutor from Edinburgh days, Robert Edmund Grant. Darwin now had an allowance plus stocks from his father, bringing him around ¬£400 per year, and his sympathies were with the amateur clerical \\"Dons in science\\" of Cambridge. =Owen and fossils= The geologist Charles Lyell invited Darwin to dinner on 29 October 1836. Over dinner Lyell listened eagerly to Darwin's stories (which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism) and introduced him to Richard Owen and William Broderip, Tories who had just been involved in voting Grant out of a position at the Zoological Society. Owen was rapidly ousting Grant as the country's leading anatomist. Darwin went to visit him at his Royal College of Surgeons, and Owen agreed to work on some animal specimens in spirits and the fossil bones. Owen shared Darwin's enthusiasm. He was a proponent of German ideas of \\"organising energy\\" and vehemently opposed to Grant's evolution. At around this time Grant was one of the few to volunteer his help with cataloguing the collection. Darwin turned down the offer, not wanting to be associated with a disreputable radical who denounced his Cambridge friends. On 12 November Darwin visited his Wedgwood relatives at Maer Hall and they encouraged him to publish a book of his travels based on his diary, an idea his sisters picked up when he visited his home. On 2 December he returned to London and began finding takers for his specimens, with Thomas Bell and the Revd. William Buckland interested in the reptiles. Darwin's reputation was being made by the giant mammal fossils. Owen's first surprising revelation was that a hippopotamus sized fossil skull 2 feet 4 inches (710 mm) long which Darwin had bought for about two shillings near Mercedes while on a \\"galloping\\" trip 120 miles (190 km) from Montevideo was of an extinct rodent-like creature resembling a giant capybara, which Owen named Toxodon. Darwin wrote to his sister Caroline that \\"[the fossils] are turning out great treasures\\" and of the Toxodon, \\"There is another head, as large as a Rhinoceros which as far as they can guess, must have been a gnawing animal. Conceive a Rat or a Hare of such a size ‚Äì What famous Cats they ought to have had in those days!\\" The College of Surgeons distributed casts of the fossils to the major scientific institutions. Darwin paid a visit to his brother Erasmus's lady friend the literary Whig Miss Harriet Martineau who had strong views on egalitarianism and whose writings had popularised the ideas of Thomas Malthus. Around this time, she was writing her Society in America which included discussion of the geological \\"process of world making\\" that she had seen on her visit to the Niagara Falls. He sat there for almost an hour. \\"She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman.\\" In her autobiography, she later recalled Charles as being \\"simple, childlike, painstaking, effective\\".Harriet Martineau's Autobiography. With Memorials by Maria Weston Chapman; 2 volumes; Smith, Elder & Co, 1877, vol. I SectionII p. 268 =Geological d√©but, species related to places= Unhappy with life in a \\"dirty odious London\\" he returned to Cambridge on 13 December then wrote his first paper, showing that the Chilean coast and the South American land-mass was rising slowly, and discussed his ideas with Lyell. To Lyell's delight, Darwin went further in balancing the rising continent with sinking mountains forming the basis of coral atolls. Darwin briefly returned to London to read his paper to the Geological Society on 4 January 1837. Despite Darwin's nerves about his d√©but, the talk was so well received that he felt \\"like a peacock admiring his tail\\". On the same day, Darwin presented 80 mammal and 450 bird specimens to the Zoological Society. The Mammalia were ably taken on by George R. Waterhouse. While the birds seemed almost an afterthought the ornithologist John Gould took them on and was quick to notice the significance of specimens from the Gal√°pagos Islands. He startlingly revealed at the next meeting on 10 January that what Darwin had taken to be wrens, blackbirds and slightly differing finches were \\"a series of ground finches which are so peculiar\\" as to form \\"an entirely new group\\" of 11 species. The story of what we now call \\"Darwin's finches\\" was covered by the daily newspapers, though Darwin was in Cambridge and did not get details at this stage. In the minutes of the meeting the number was extended to 12 species. Owen was finding unexpected relationships from the fossils: the batch included the horse sized Scelidotherium which appeared to be closely allied to the anteater, a gigantic ground sloth, and an ox-sized armoured armadillo which he called Glyptodon. The Patagonian spine and leg bones from Port St Julian which Darwin had thought might be from a Mastodon were apparently from a gigantic guanaco or Llama, or perhaps camel, which Owen named Macrauchenia. Lyell saw a \\"law of succession\\" with mammals being replaced by their own kind on each continent, and on 17 February used his presidential address at the Geological Society to present Owen's findings to date on Darwin's fossils, pointing out this inference that extinct species were related to current species in the same locality. He invited Darwin to come along, and the speech drew Darwin's attention to the question of why past and present species in one place should be so closely related. At the same meeting Darwin was elected to the Council of the Society. For Lyell this was \\"a glorious addition to my society of geologists\\", gentlemen (and amateurs of independent means) with duty only to scientific integrity, social stability and responsible religion, for Darwin it meant joining the respectable √©lite of eminent geologists developing a science dealing with the age of the earth and the Days of Creation. Darwin had already been invited by FitzRoy to contribute his Journal, based on his field notes, as the natural history section of the captain's account of the Beagle's voyage, and this ended up keeping him fully occupied from 13 March to the end of September. He also plunged into writing a book on South American Geology, putting his and Lyell's ideas forward against the cataclysmic explanation of mountain formation Alcide d'Orbigny was promoting in a multi-volume account of the continent begun two years previously. On Monday 27 February Darwin presented a talk to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on glassy tubes he had found amongst Maldonado sand dunes, explained by lightning having fused the sand. To supervise his collections Darwin had to return to London, and on Lyell's advice he planned to arrive on Friday 3 March 1837, in time for one of Charles Babbage's Saturday parties, talking shops about the latest developments \\"brilliantly attended by fashionable ladies, as well as literary and scientific gents\\" and \\"a good mixture of pretty women\\", bankers and politicians, where Babbage promoted such projects as his mechanical computer. proposes a move on Friday 3 March 1837 At first Darwin stayed with Erasmus, in his journal written up later he put his date of moving as 6 March 1837. On the 13th he moved to nearby lodgings, joining Erasmus's circle of friends including Martineau and Hensleigh and enjoying his intimate dinner parties with guests such as Lyell, Babbage and Thomas Carlyle.Darwin's Journal () backdated from August 1838 gives a date of 6 March 1837 In their first meeting to discuss his detailed findings, Gould told Darwin that the Gal√°pagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and the finch group included the \\"wrens\\". The two rheas were also distinct species, and on 14 March Gould's announcement of this finding to the Zoological Society of London was accompanied by Darwin, who presented a paper on how distribution of the two species of rheas changed going southwards. TransmutationContext= Darwin was concerned to make sure that his theorising, whether published or private, fully complied with the accepted scientific methodology of his peers. In the scientific societies and at informal dinners he discussed methods with two leading authorities on the topic, John Herschel and William Whewell. Scientific circles were buzzing with ideas of natural theology. In a letter to Lyell, Herschel had written of \\"that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others\\". This was circulated and widely discussed, with scientists sharing Herschel's approach of looking for an answer through laws of nature and rejecting ad hoc miracles as an explanation. Charles Babbage expressed in his Ninth Bridgewater Treatise (1837) a view of \\"Nature's God\\" along the lines of a programmer of such laws. Darwin's freethinking brother Erasmus was part of this Whig circle and a close friend of the writer Harriet Martineau, who promoted the Malthusianism underlying the controversial Whig Poor Law reforms (1834) to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty, which were then being implemented piecemeal in the face of opposition to the new poorhouses. As a Unitarian, Martineau welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, which was promoted by Grant and some medical men but anathema to Darwin's Anglican friends who saw it as a threat to the social order. Transmutation threatened the essential distinction between man and beast, and implied progressive improvement with the implication that the lower orders could aspire to the privileges of their aristocratic overlords. The medical establishment controlling the London teaching hospitals, including the Royal College of Surgeons, was restricted to Anglicans and dominated by the aristocracy who saw perfect animal design as proof of a natural theology supporting their ideas of God-given rank and privilege. Since the 1820s large numbers of private medical schools joined by the new London University had introduced the \\"philosophical anatomy\\" of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire based on unity of plan compatible with the transmutation of species, implying ideas of progressive improvement and supporting radical demands for democracy. This anatomy had already spread from Paris to the medical schools of Edinburgh, and the new London schools attracted Scots, including Grant. Numerous journals now promoted these radical ideas, including Thomas Wakley's The Lancet (started in 1823 with support from William Cobbett and William Lawrence, whose 1819 publication of evolutionary ideas the Crown had prosecuted for blasphemy). In response, the medical establishment gave support to the idealist biology of Joseph Henry Green (1791‚Äì1863) and of his younger prot√©g√© Richard Owen (1804‚Äì1892), based on the vitalism of German Naturphilosophie and Platonic idealism, which saw anatomical forms as \\"archetypes\\" in the Divine mind, imposed through \\"descensive\\" powers of delegation of divine authority in accordance with traditional hierarchies. =Red Notebook= In 1836 Darwin used his Red Notebook to record field observations during the last stages of his Beagle voyage, from May to 25 September. Page 113 mentions a meeting with Richard Owen, after the ship's return to England in October. Later notes mention discussions with other experts, including the geographer Sir Woodbine Parish, geologists Charles Lyell and Roderick Murchison, and the conchologist James De Carle Sowerby. Darwin also took brief notes on what he was reading, reminders on planned publications including his Journal of the voyage, and his developing \\"theories\\", \\"conjectures\\", and \\"hypotheses\\". He continued using the notebook until May or June 1837. In his later \\"Journal\\", Darwin recalled having been \\"greatly struck from about month of previous March on character of S. American fossils ‚Äì & species on Galapagos Archipelago. ‚Äì These facts origin (especially latter) of all my views.\\" His first reference to transmutation appears in the Red Notebook around early March 1837, after John Gould told him that the common Rhea was a different species to the Petisse. Darwin wrote \\"Speculate on neutral ground of 2 ostriches; bigger one encroaches on smaller. change not progressif: produced at one blow. if one species altered\\", proposing a sudden change or saltation in contrast to Lamarck's idea that species graded imperceptibly into each other: later, Darwin referred to this jump as inosculation. He drew on the relationship Owen had shown between fossils of the extinct giant Macrauchenia and the modern guanacos that Darwin had hunted in Patagonia: \\"The same kind of relation that common ostrich bears to [Petisse]: extinct Guanaco to recent: in former case position, in latter time. .... ‚Äì As in first cases distinct species inosculate, so must we believe ancient ones: not gradual change or degeneration. from circumstances: if one species does change into another it must be per saltum ‚Äì or species may perish.\\" Here, he related the geographical distribution of species to their replacement over time, and tentatively proposed that the Rheas had a shared ancestor. He noted his thoughts on reproduction and extinction; \\"Tempted to believe animals created for a definite time: ‚Äì not extinguished by change of circumstances\\", and various domesticated animals had \\"all run wild & bred. no doubt with perfect success. ‚Äì showing non-Creation does not bear upon solely adaptation of animals. ‚Äì extinction in same manner may not depend. ‚Äì There is no more wonder in extinction of species than of individual.\\" Darwin's notes mention several papers based on his geological writings during the voyage. At the Geographical Society meeting on 3 May 1837, Darwin read his paper on strata around R√≠o de la Plata where he had found fossils including the Toxodon.Darwin, C. R. 1837. A sketch of the deposits containing extinct Mammalia in the neighbourhood of the Plata. [Read 3 May] Proceedings of the Geological Society of London 2: 542‚Äì44. At the same meeting, announcements were made of the first discoveries of ancient fossil primates; finds by Proby Cautley and Hugh Falconer in Neogene strata of the Sivalik Hills, and by √âdouard Lartet in Miocene beds at Sansan, Gers. Later, Lyell joked uncomfortably to his sister that \\"according to Lamarck's view, there may have been a great many thousand centuries for their tails to wear off, and the transformation to men to take place\\", but Darwin was beginning to look at these \\"wonderful\\" fossils in relation to transmutation., Allen, Grant, (March 1882) Sir Charles Lyell, Popular Science Monthly Volume 20 Darwin's notes mentioned his \\"Coral Paper\\" which he had originally drafted in 1835; he presented this on 31 May 1837 at the Geological Society of London, and later used it as the basis for his book on The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. At their frequent meetings, Owen argued that intrinsic \\"organising energy\\" in the \\"embryonic germ\\" set the lifespan of the species and precluded transmutation. The botanist Robert Brown showed Darwin a different concept, of \\"swarming atoms\\" inside the germ, allowing nature's self-development. Embarrassed by his lack of labels for his finch specimens, he examined FitzRoy's in the British Museum and contacted seamen including Syms Covington for their collections. From this he was able to relate the finches to separate islands, with distinct species on each island. As well as pressing on with his Journal, he started an ambitious project to get the expert reports on his collection published as a multi-volume Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle. A search for sponsorship was answered when Henslow used his contacts with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Thomas Spring Rice to arrange a Treasury grant of ¬£1,000, a sum equivalent to about ¬£ in present-day terms. During the Beagle voyage Darwin had noted the distribution of the two species of Gal√°pagos iguanas and suspected that \\"this genus, the species of which are so well adapted to their respective localities, is peculiar to this group of Isds\\". He had identified the sea iguanas from a book on board as having been named Amblyrhyncus Cristatus by Bell from a specimen which had arrived in Mexico, probably found on the Pacific shore. In June he gave this information to William Buckland. As the Victorian era began, Darwin pressed on with writing his Journal, and in August 1837 began correcting printer's proofs. Transmutation notebooks In mid-July 1837, as his Red Notebook filled up, Darwin reorganised his note-taking, and began two new notebooks: his \\"A\\" notebook on geology, and his \\"B\\" notebook, the first of a series on \\"transmutation of Species\\", in which he scribbled down a framework for his speculations, jotting down thoughts on evolution. In a phrase he used later, this became \\"mental rioting\\". =B notebook= The title page of the \\"B\\" notebook was headed Zo√∂nomia, referring to his late grandfather's evolutionary ideas, and began with questions about the reasons for \\"generation\\" in which asexual reproduction resulted in copies of the original, while sexual reproduction produced variation in the offspring, and organisms had short lifespans. The world was known to have changed over time, and \\"the young of living beings, become permanently changed or subject to variety, according to circumstances\\". This included plants, animals, and humanity: \\"in course of generations even mind and instinct become influenced. ‚Äì child of savage not civilized man.\\" Full- grown organisms might be unchangeable, but variability of their offspring would \\"adapt & alter the race to changing world.\\" His ideas predated genetic concepts, and he continued to believe that variations arose through reproduction in a purposeful way responding to changes in the environment. Not all would succeed: \\"The father being climatized, climatizes the child. Whether every animal produces in course of ages ten thousand varieties (influenced itself perhaps by circumstances) & those alone preserved which are well adapted.\\" evolutionary tree diagram. In a large population, \\"intermarriages\\" (crossing) would even out these variations and explain why species appeared constant, but reproductive isolation of a small sub-group could lead to divergence and geographic speciation: \\"animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances\\", as in the various species he had seen of Gal√°pagos tortoises and mockingbirds, the Falkland Fox and the Chiloe fox, the \\"Inglish and Irish Hare\\". What Darwin called \\"inosculation\\" would abruptly introduce a clear distinction between even the most closely related species, explaining the rheas which remained distinct species with overlapping territories. Uniquely for his time, he envisaged this diverging adaptation as genealogical branching from a common ancestor, an evolutionary tree: \\"Organized beings represent a tree irregularly branched some branches far more branched ‚Äì Hence Genera. ‚Äì ) As many terminal buds dying as new ones generated\\". Refining the concept, he proposed a coral of life; \\"The tree of life should perhaps be called the coral of life, base of branches dead; so that passages cannot be seen\\". With the words \\"I think\\", he sketched a diagram of this branching pattern. This novel view contrasted with the ideas of transmutationists of the time (including Lamarck and Grant), who envisaged independent parallel lineages impelled by inner forces to make progress to higher forms. Darwin protested against these linear ideas of progress; \\"It is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another. ‚Äì We consider those, when the intellectual faculties [or] cerebral structure most developed, as highest. ‚Äì A bee doubtless would when the instincts were\\". Later in the notebook, he set down a progressionist concept of human origins: \\"If all men were dead, then monkeys make men. ‚Äì Men make angels\\". Darwin thought that the possibility of a common ancestor of \\"mammalia & fish\\" could not be ruled out when such strange forms as the platypus existed. The unique plants and animals on the Gal√°pagos islands sharing features with mainland American species, while wandering birds such as sandpipers were unchanged, showed the way \\"creative power acted at Galapagos\\", confirmed \\"if we believe the Creator created by any laws, which I think is shown by the very facts of the Zoological character of these islands\\". A similar relationship in time was shown by the extinct armoured giant Glyptodon resembling the modern South American armadillo. He considered that the way that astronomers once thought that God ordered the movement of individual planets was comparable to individual creation of species in particular countries, but divine powers were \\"much more simple & sublime\\" in creating the first animals so that species then arose by \\"the fixed laws of generation\\". A hypothesis of \\"fresh creations\\" he saw as \\"mere assumption, it explains nothing further\\". From Owen, he learnt of John Hunter's observations on \\"the production of monsters\\" (mutants) at birth, and he noted that this could \\"present an analogy to production of species\\". He jotted down thoughts on how organisms could reach new islands: could \\"Owls transport mice alive?\\". Seeds might be blown over, transported by floating trees or eaten by birds which flew to the islands. He noted a reminder to \\"Experimentise on land shells in salt water & lizards\\" ditto. Under pressure with organising Zoology and correcting proofs of his Journal (which had to have the introduction revised when FitzRoy complained that he was \\"astonished at the total omission of any notice of the officers\\" for their help), Darwin's health suffered. On 20 September 1837 he suffered \\"an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart\\". His doctors advised him \\"strongly to knock off all work\\" and to leave for the country. Two days later he went to Maer Hall, the Wedgwoods' home, for a month of recuperation. His relations wore him out with questions about gaucho life. His invalid aunt was being cared for by the as-yet unmarried Emma, and his uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam which Jos though might have been the work of earthworms. Darwin returned to London on 21 October and on 1 November gave a talk on the role of earthworms in soil formation to the Geological Society, a mundane subject which to them may have seemed eccentric. William Buckland subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as \\"a new & important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth ‚Äì in fact a new Geological Power\\", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way. Darwin had avoided taking on official posts which would take valuable time, turning down William Whewell's request that he become Secretary of the Geological Society with excuses including \\"anything which flurries me completely knocks me up afterwards and brings on a bad palpitation of the heart\\", but in January 1838 he accepted the post. On 7 March he read to the Society his longest paper yet, which explained the earthquake he had witnessed at Concepci√≥n, Chile, in terms of gradual crustal movements, to the delight of Lyell. Despite hours of practice, as he later recalled; \\"I was so nervous at first, I somehow could see nothing all around me, & felt as if my body was gone, & only my head left\\". Darwin, C. R. 1838. On the connexion of certain volcanic ph√¶nomena, and on the formation of mountain-chains and volcanos, as the effects of continental elevations. [Read 7 March] Proceedings of the Geological Society of London 2: 654‚Äì60 At the same time, Darwin pondered likely opposition to his ideas. Sure that there must have been \\"a thousand intermediate forms\\" between the modern otter and its land-only ancestor, he thought \\"Opponent will say. show them me. I will answer yes, if you will show me every step between bull Dog & Greyhound\\". He privately scorned Whewell's faith in a human-centred universe, perfectly adapted to man, and wrote that \\"My theory would give zest to recent & fossil Comparative Anatomy, it would lead to study of instincts, heredity & mind heredity, whole metaphysics\\". Contrary to the views of his Cambridge professors that humans were \\"godlike\\", around February 1838 Darwin wrote in his B notebook; \\"Animals whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. ‚Äì Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind ‚Äì animals with affections, imitation, fear of death, pain, sorrow for the dead. ‚Äì respect.\\" The expectation of finding \\"the father of mankind\\" was comparable to finding Macrauchenia, and \\"if we choose to let conjecture run wild then our animals our fellow brethern in pain, disease, death & suffering, & famine, our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements. they may partake from our origin in one common ancestor; we may be all netted together.\\" =C notebook: animal observations= By February 1838 Darwin was on to a new pocketbook, the maroon C notebook, and was investigating the breeding of domestic animals. He found the newspaper wholesaler William Yarrell at the Zoological museum a fund of knowledge, and questioned if breeders weren't going against nature in \\"picking varieties\\". He was now writing of \\"Descent\\" rather than transmutation, and hinting at ideas of \\"adaptation\\" to climate. At the zoo on 28 March he had his first sight of an ape, and was impressed at the orang-utan's antics \\"just like a naughty child\\" when the keeper held back an apple. In his notes he wrote \\"Let man visit Ourang-outang in domestication, hear expressive whine, see its intelligence.... let him look at savage...naked, artless, not improving yet improvable & let him dare to boast of his proud preeminence.\\" Here Darwin was drawing on his experience of the natives of Tierra del Fuego and daring to think that there was little gulf between man and animals despite the theological doctrine that only humanity possessed a soul. On 1 April Charles wrote to his older sister Susan that he had also seen the rhinoceros in the zoo let out for the first time that spring, \\"kicking & rearing\\" and galloping for joy. He then passed on the gossip that Miss Martineau had been \\"as frisky lately [as] the Rhinoceros. ‚Äì Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night: ‚Äì if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would loose it. ‚Äì Lyell called there the other day & there was a beautiful rose on the table, & she coolly showed it to him & said \\"Erasmus Darwin\\" gave me that. ‚Äì How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman\\". He began thinking about marriage himself, and on the back of an old letter (dated 7 April 1838) he listed the pros and cons of London, Cambridge or the countryside, noting that \\"I have so much more pleasure in direct observation, that I could not go on as Lyell does, correcting & adding up new information to old train & I do not see what line can be followed by man tied down to London. ‚Äì In country, experiment & observations on lower animals. ‚Äì more space ‚Äì \\". Darwin, C. R. 'Work finished If not marry' [Memorandum on marriage]. (1838) CUL-DAR210.8.1 (Darwin Online) In an 8 May letter to his Cambridge friend Charles Thomas Whitley, who had recently married, Darwin described himself as having \\"turned a complete scribbler\\", and said \\"Of the future I know nothing I never look further ahead than two or three Chapters ‚Äì for my life is now measured by volume, chapters & sheets & has little to do with the sun ‚Äì As for a wife, that most interesting specimen in the whole series of vertebrate animals, Providence only know whether I shall ever capture one or be able to feed her if caught.\\" Darwin found a pamphlet by Yarrell's friend Sir John Sebright, with a passage reading: > A severe winter, or a scarcity of food, by destroying the weak and the > unhealthy, has all the good effects of the most skilful selection. In cold > or barren countries no animals can live to the age of maturity, but those > who have strong constitutions; the weak and the unhealthy do not live to > propagate their infirmities. Sebright said females went to \\"the most vigorous males\\", and \\"the strongest individuals of both sexes, by driving away the weakest, will enjoy the best food, and the most favourable positions, for themselves and their offspring.\\" After reading the pamphlet, Darwin commented \\"excellent observations of sickly offspring being cut off so that not propagated by nature. ‚Äì Whole art of making varieties may be inferred from facts stated\\". Speculations Darwin's speculations in his notebooks deepened as he wondered how instincts and mental traits were passed on to offspring; \\"Thought (or desires more properly) being hereditary it is difficult to imagine it anything but structure of brain hereditary, analogy points out to this. ‚Äì love of the deity effect of organization, oh you materialist!\\", and reminded himself to read Barclay \\"on organization!!\\" He struggled on with the Beagle geology, overworked, worried and suffering stomach upsets and headaches which laid him up for days on end. Privately he thought of the social implications of evolution, writing \\"Educate all classes. avoid the contamination of castes, improve the women (double influence) & mankind must improve.\\" This was similar to the position of the radical Lamarckians, but female education was already supported by the whole Wedgwood- Darwin family, and strongly advocated by Martineau. Darwin wrote \\"Man in his arrogance thinks himself a great work worthy the interposition of a deity, more humble & I believe truer to consider him created from animals.\\" In an early precursor of his work on The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin turned round the theological idea of Charles Bell that humans were designed to expose their canine teeth when grinning, and explained the expression by shared descent: \\"no doubt a habit gained by formerly being a baboon with great canine teeth. ‚Äì Blend this argument with his having canine teeth at all. ‚Äì This way of viewing the subject important. Laughing modified barking, smiling modified laughing. Barking to tell other animals in associated kinds of good news, discovery of prey, arising no doubt from want of assistance. ‚Äì crying is a puzzler. ‚Äì Under this point of view expression of all animals becomes very curious ‚Äì a dog snarling in play.\\" Darwin had privately talked with his cousin \\"Hensleigh Wedgwood about the relationship of humans to animals; \\"Hensleigh says the love of the deity & thought of him or eternity only difference between the mind of man & animals. ‚Äì yet how faint in a Fuegian or Australian!\\" Darwin's own experience with \\"savages\\" he had met on the Beagle expedition showed that not all humans shared these religious beliefs. As he worried at these ideas and the Beagle Geology his illness intensified, with stomach upsets, headaches and heart troubles, so that he became overworked and laid up for days on end. In May he wrote to his sister Caroline Wedgwood hoping to visit his relatives in July or early August, \\"but I shall be cruelly hurried ‚Äì as I have to go to Scotland for Geological work\\" and also had to be in London every second month for the publication of his Zoology. \\"I hope I may be able to work on right hard during the next three years, otherwise I shall never have finished, ‚Äì but I find the noddle & the stomach are antagonist powers, and that it is a great deal more easy to think too much in a day, than to think too little ‚Äì What thought has to do with digesting roast beef, ‚Äì I cannot say, but they are brother faculties.\\" Darwin's cousin William Darwin Fox gave helpful answers to his questions about crossing domestic breeds, and in his reply of 15 June, Darwin admitted for the first time that \\"It is my prime hobby & I really think some day, I shall be able to do something on that most intricate subject species & varieties.\\" At the same time Darwin was gaining public position, and on 21 June 1838 was elected to the establishment Athen√¶um Club, along with Charles Dickens. From the start of August, Darwin began going there each day to \\"dine at the Athen√¶um like a gentleman, or rather like a Lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat in that great drawing room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a duke. ‚Äì I am full of admiration at the Athen√¶um; one meets so many people there, that one likes to see. ... I enjoy it the more, because I fully expected to detest it.\\" Thoughts of marriage The Hensleigh Wedgwoods were now living next door to Erasmus. In early June 1838 they were visited for a week by Catherine Darwin and Emma Wedgwood, returning from a family get-together in Paris. As Emma told her aunt a few weeks later, \\"Charles used to come from next door, so we were a very pleasant, merry party.\\" Illness prompted Darwin to take a break from the pressure of work: on 15 June he told his cousin William Darwin Fox; \\"I have not been very well of late, which has suddenly determined me to leave London earlier than I had anticipated. I go by the steam-packet to Edinburgh. ‚Äì take a solitary walk on Salisbury crags & call up old thoughts of former times then go on to Glasgow & the great valley of Inverness, ‚Äì near which I intend stopping a week to geologise the parallel roads of Glen Roy, ‚Äì thence to Shrewsbury, Maer for one day, & London for smoke, ill health & hard work.\\" On 23 June 1838 he took the steamboat to Edinburgh to go \\"geologising\\" in Scotland. After revisiting Edinburgh on 28 June (the day that Queen Victoria had her coronation in London) he went on to Fort William. At Glen Roy in glorious weather he was convinced that he had solved the riddle of the \\"parallel roads\\" around the glen, which he identified as raised beaches, though later geologists would support the ideas of Louis Agassiz that these had been formed by glaciation. Fully recuperated and optimistic, he returned home to The Mount, Shrewsbury. He discussed his ideas with his father and asked for advice about Emma. Speaking from experience, Doctor Robert Waring Darwin told his son to conceal religious doubts which could cause \\"extreme misery... Things went on pretty well until the husband or wife became out of health, and then some women suffered miserably by doubting about the salvation of their husbands, thus making them likewise to suffer.\\" Charles drew up a list with two columns on a scrap of paper. Under Marry he listed benefits, \\"Children‚Äìif it please God‚ÄìConstant companion & friend in old age will feel interested in one,‚Äìobject to be beloved and played with, better than a dog anyhow\\", while under Not Marry he put \\"Freedom to go where one liked ... Not forced to visit relatives ... to have the expense and anxiety of children ... fatness & idleness ... if many children forced to earn one's bread ...\\". He jotted down further thoughts, then concluded \\"My God, it is intolerable to think of spending ones whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working, & nothing after all. ‚Äì No, no won't do. ‚Äì Imagine living all one's day solitarily in smoky dirty London House. ‚Äì Only picture to yourself a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music perhaps ‚Äì Compare this vision with the dingy reality of Grt. Marlbro' St. Marry‚ÄìMarry‚ÄìMarry Q.E.D.\\"Darwin, C. R. (7.1838) This is the Question Marry Not Marry [Memorandum on marriage]. CUL-DAR210.8.2 Then he spent his fortnight being \\"Very idle at Shrewsbury\\" which meant starting his \\"D\\" notebook on the transmutation sequence and his \\"M\\" notebook on the evolutionary basis of moral and social behaviour, filling sixty pages with notes and anecdotes from his father about experiences with patients. Having come down in favour, he went to visit his cousin Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but failed to conceal his ideas on transmutation. Emma noted \\"he is the most open, transparent man I ever saw, and every word expresses his real thoughts.\\" When she asked about ultimate origins he steered clear of the subject, aware that \\"it will become necessary to show how the first eye is formed\\" which he could not yet do. Malthus and natural law After returning to London on 1 August 1838 Darwin read a review of Auguste Comte's Positive Philosophy at the Athenaeum Club. It bolstered his pantheist ideas of natural laws, making him remark \\"What a magnificent view one can take of the world\\" with everything synchronised \\"by certain laws of harmony\\", a vision \\"far grander\\" than the Almighty individually creating \\"a long succession of vile Molluscous animals ‚Äì How beneath the dignity of Him\\"! Only a \\"cramped imagination\\" saw God \\"warring against those very laws he established in all organic nature.\\" His work on Coral Reefs and a paper theorising that Glen Roy had been an arm of the sea soldiered on. He visited the zoo to experiment, observing the reactions of the apes and seeing emotions like \\"revenge and anger\\", implying that \\"Our descent, then, [is the root] of our evil passions.\\" He needed an ally, and hinted to Lyell that his work was \\"bearing on the question of species\\", amassing \\"facts, which begin to group themselves clearly under sub-laws.\\" Then in late September he began reading \\"for amusement\\" the 6th edition of Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population which reminded him of Malthus's statistical proof that human populations breed beyond their means and compete to survive, at a time when he was primed to apply these ideas to animal species. Malthus had softened from the bleakness of the earlier editions, now allowing that the population crush could be mitigated by education, celibacy and emigration. Already Radical crowds were demonstrating against the harsh imposition of Malthusian ideas in the Poor Laws, and a slump was resulting in mass emigration. Lyell was convinced that animals were also driven to spread their territory by overpopulation, but Darwin went further in applying the Whig social thinking of struggle for survival with no handouts. His views were secular, but not atheistic. He asked how God's laws had produced \\"so high a mind\\" as ours, with purpose shown by descent geared towards the \\"production of higher animals\\", suggesting that \\"we are [a] step towards some higher end\\". Malthus's essay calculates from the birth rate that human population could double every 25 years, but in practice growth is kept in check by death, disease, wars and famine.An Essay on the Principle of Population 6th edition, 1826..Huxley, Thomas, 1897, Evolution and Ethics and Other Essays\\", D. Appleton and Company, New York. Section IV, Capital ‚Äì The Mother of Labour, pp. 162‚Äì63. Darwin was well prepared to see at once that this related to de Candolle's concept of \\"nature's war\\" and also applies to the struggle for existence amongst wildlife, so that when there is more population than resources can maintain, favourable variations that allow the organism to better use the limited resources available tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones destroyed by being unable to get the means for existence, resulting in the formation of new species. On 28 September 1838 he noted this insight, describing it as a kind of wedging, forcing adapted structures into gaps in the economy of nature formed as weaker ones were thrust out. He now had a theory by which to work.Charles Darwin: gentleman naturalist A biographical sketch by John van Wyhe, 2006 Proposal Darwin's thoughts and work continued and he suffered repeated bouts of illness. On 11 November he returned to Maer Hall and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and she subsequently wrote telling him of her \\"fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain.\\" She continued; \\"my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins at the end of the 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling.\\" In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to \\"love one another\\", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says \\"If a man abide not in me...they are burned\\". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that \\"To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject.\\" However, this tension would remain. Emma's father promised a dowry of ¬£5,000 plus ¬£400 a year, while Doctor Darwin added ¬£10,000 for Charles, to be invested. They decided to move to London until Charles had \\"wearied the geological public\\" with his itch to write, then they would \\"decide, whether the pleasures of retirement & country... are preferable to society.\\" Theory Charles went house-hunting by day. At night he thought about \\"innumerable variations\\" (which he still thought were acquired in some way) with competitive nature selecting the best leading to step by step change, while vestigial organs like the human coccyx (tail) were not, as commonly thought, God \\"rounding out his original thought [to its] exhaustion\\", but ancestral remnants pointing to \\"the parent of man\\". Darwin considered Malthus's argument, that human populations breed beyond their means and compete to survive, in relation to his findings about species relating to localities, earlier enquiries into animal breeding, and ideas of Natural \\"laws of harmony\\". Around late November 1838 he compared breeders selecting traits to a Malthusian Nature selecting from random variants, now thrown up by \\"chance\\", and in mid-December described this comparison as \\"a beautiful part of my theory, that domesticated races of organics are made by precisely same means as species ‚Äì but latter far more perfectly & infinitely slower\\", so that in \\"species every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical & perfected.\\" The second edition of Charles Babbage's The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. A Fragment published that year included a copy of a letter John Herschel had sent to Charles Lyell in 1836, not long before Darwin visited Herschel in Cape Town. On 2 December, Darwin wrote in his E Notebook \\"Babbage 2d Edit. p. 226 ‚Äì Herschel calls the appearance of new species the mystery of mysteries, & has grand passage upon the problem.! Hurrah ‚Äì 'intermediate causes' \\". Herschel's letter advocated seeking natural causes, as opposed to miraculous causes, and gave philosophical justification to Darwin's project. =Stress= The Zoology ran into difficulties, with Richard Owen having to halt work on Fossil Mammalia, and John Gould sailing off for Tasmania leaving Darwin to complete the half finished Birds. \\"What can a man have to say, who works all morning in describing hawks & owls; & then rushes out , & walks in a bewildered manner up one street & down another, looking out for the word To Let'.\\" Emma had arranged to come with the Hensleigh Wedgwoods to London for a week to help with the search for a house, and wrote telling him \\"It is very well I am coming to look after you my poor old man\\", before arriving on 6 December. On 19 December 1838 as secretary of the Geological Society of London Darwin witnessed the vicious interrogation by Owen and his allies including Sedgwick and Buckland of Darwin's old tutor Robert Edmund Grant when they ridiculed Grant's Lamarckian heresy in a clear reminder of establishment hatred of evolutionism. During her visit, Emma thought Darwin looked unwell and overtired. At the end of December she wrote urging him \\"to leave town at once & get some rest. You have looked so unwell for some time that I fear you will be laid up... nothing could make me so happy as to feel that I could be of any use or comfort to my own dear Charles when he is not well. So don't be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you\\". Marriage On 29 December 1838, Darwin took the let of a furnished property at 12 Upper Gower Street. He wrote to Emma that \\"Gower St is ours, yellow curtains & all\\", and of his delight at being the \\"possessor of Macaw Cottage\\". which he long recalled for its gaudy coloured walls and furniture that \\"combined all the colours of the macaw in hideous discord\\",Litchfield, H. E. [Recollection of Darwin on Macaw cottage]. CUL-DAR112.B99 Emma rejoiced at their getting a house she liked, while hoping that they had got rid of \\"that dead dog out of the garden\\". Darwin impatiently moved his \\"museum\\" in on 31 December, astounding himself, Erasmus and the porters with the weight of his luggage containing geological specimens. On 24 January 1839 he was honoured by being elected as Fellow of the Royal Society and presented his paper on the Roads of Glen Roy. The next day he took the train home to Shrewsbury, then on the 28th travelled to Maer Hall. On 29 January 1839, Charles married Emma at Maer, Staffordshire in an Anglican ceremony arranged to also suit the Unitarians, conducted by the vicar, their cousin John Allen Wedgwood. Emma's bedridden mother slept through the service, sparing Emma \\"the pain of parting\\". Immediately afterwards Charles and Emma rushed off to the railway station, raising their relative's eyebrows, and ate their sandwiches and toasted their future from a \\"bottle of water\\" on the train. Back at Macaw Cottage, Charles noted in his journal \\"Married at Maer & returned to London 30 years old\\", and in his \\"E\\" notebook recorded uncle John Wedgwood's views on turnips. See the development of Darwin's theory for the ensuing developments, in the context of his life, work and outside influences at the time.

One firefighter was killed and 66 civilians were injured as a result of the fire. The 1996 motion picture Daylight, starring Sylvester Stallone, was loosely based on this incident. Timeline Ignition = At 8:30 a.m. a truck carrying eighty 55-gallon (210 L) drums of carbon disulfide entered the southern tube at the New Jersey portal. The tunnel had two tubes, the southern one for eastbound traffic and the northern one for westbound traffic. At the time, it was forbidden to carry carbon disulfide through either tube. After the truck had traveled east for approximately 2900 feet (880 m) in heavy traffic, one of the drums broke free of its restraints, fell onto the roadway and cracked open. Vapor released from the drum was ignited when it came into contact with a hot surface, probably a brake shoe or exhaust pipe.Egilsrud, P., Prevention and Control of Highway Tunnel Fires, FHWA report RD-083-32, May 1984, pp. 6‚Äì8 Carbon disulfide vapor ignites when raised to a temperature of , so it was considered highly flammable; moreover, it could be deadly if inhaled in large amounts. The truck came to rest in the left lane of the tunnel on a 0.25% downgrade and began to burn. Four trucks stopped on the right lane and also caught fire or were abandoned, and five more trucks caught fire slightly to the back of the carbon disulfide-carrying truck. The tunnel west of the fire became gridlocked with traffic; ultimately, 125 vehicles got stuck in the tube before it was closed. =Emergency response= Port Authority patrolmen in the tube east and west of the truck radioed in to advise of the blockage (8:48 a.m.) then to advise of the fire (8:56 a.m.). They assisted drivers to escape to the north tube through cross-passages. Tunnel staff entered the New Jersey portal to evacuate the occupants there and started to reverse vehicles out, while a wrecker crew drove the wrong way along the south tube and began fighting the fire at the site of the truck where it started. At the time of the fire, the tunnel was operated by the Port Authority, which had control of various other transportation facilities in the area as well. Consequently, they had a wrecker crew at the eastern end of the south tube. They initiated firefighting operations at the site of the fire with a hose about five minutes after it started. However, they soon realized that they needed extra assistance due to the confined nature of the fire. The Jersey City Fire Department (JCFD) was alerted at 9:05 a.m., and the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) was alerted at 9:12 a.m. The FDNY crew set up a command post in the north tunnel at a cross passage near to the fire. They relieved the wrecker crew and transmitted a 2nd alarm at 9:30 a.m. When the JCFD crews arrived at the tunnel portal, they also sent requests for more firefighters and for breathing equipment. The crews also worked on placing illumination inside the tunnel. The FDNY and JCFD called up 29 firefighting trucks of varying types and borrowed four more trucks with breathing apparatus from Consolidated Edison. In total there were about 63 emergency response vehicles (including police, medical units, Port Authority vehicles and supervisory vehicles). Hot smoke caused a second fire to start, in a group of trucks apparently carrying paint and turpentine approximately 350 feet (110 m) west of the original fire. After this, the tunnel ventilation system was turned to full exhaust and full supply in order to extract smoke and reduce the likelihood of other spontaneous ignitions. New Jersey firefighters succeeded in extinguishing the second fire, and cleared a path for emergency vehicles to the first fire site where they linked up with the New York firefighters. The tunnel fire main, a water pipe cast directly into the secondary concrete lining, continued to function throughout the fire. The FDNY supplemented this with water from a hose. The fire was the first time in the FDNY's history that it had been required to use four rescue squad vehicles at the same fire. = Tunnel ventilation = At 9:45 a.m. the tunnel's built-in ventilation system was turned to full extract and full supply in the zone of the fire. The supply of air through the duct under the roadway enabled firefighters to work without masks. Although the smoke in the tube was toxic, first responders were able to breathe by inhaling clean air from the curbside vents at the bottom of the tube. The extract duct above the roadway captured some of the smoke and when the false ceiling at the site of the fire collapsed, a hole formed between the road tunnel and the extract ventilation duct: this hole dramatically improved the capture of smoke at the main fire site, though it reduced smoke capture at the second fire site to practically nothing.Foote, R. S., Research for Optimal Ventilation at the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, paper B3, pp. B3-33-B3-54, Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on the Aerodynamics and Ventilation of Vehicle Tunnels, Canterbury, 1973. BHRA 1974: Two of the extract fans in the New Jersey vent shaft failed due to the heat of the fire; the shaft was approximately 300 feet (100 m) west of the fire, and was apparently drawing air at . The third fan was kept in working order by cooling it with a water spray. = Recovery and cleanup = By 1:00 p.m. the fire had been surrounded. The westbound tube, which had not been affected directly by the fire, reopened to two-way traffic at 2:15 p.m. However, work continued on cleaning up the eastbound tube and extracting the trucks that were trapped there. By 4:45 p.m., three trucks had been towed out of the New Jersey side. Despite a re- ignition of the fire at 6:50 p.m. the stop message was issued at 12:52 a.m. the next morning. The wreckage was cleared up quickly, and the eastbound tunnel reopened to traffic on the evening of Sunday, May 15. Aftermath Injuries and death = In total, 66 people were injured, mostly by smoke inhalation. Of these, 27 were hospitalized One firefighter, Battalion Chief Gunther E. Beake, was severely affected by smoke inhalation and died of his injuries on August 23, 1949. = Damage = The truck carrying carbon disulfide was completely destroyed, as were nine other trucks. 13 trucks were damaged. The infrastructure suffered extensive damage: approximately 650 short tons (590 tonnes) of rubble were removed during the weekend before the tunnel reopened. The tiles on the tunnel walls spalled off for a distance of approximately 200 feet (60 m) west of the fire site and 500 feet (150 m) east of it. At the site of the fire, the concrete lining of the walls spalled down to the ribs of the cast-iron primary lining. The false ceiling above the roadway, which consisted of a , in situ, reinforced concrete slab, collapsed completely in several places and collapsed partially over a length of approximately 500 feet (150 m). The roadway itself was unharmed, but had a lot of debris on it. Half of the tunnel's long-distance phone cables had been severed during the fire. The elevated side walkway had to be renewed over a length of 750 feet (230 m), and the cable ducts cast into the walkway and walls were replaced over 300 feet (90 m). Damaged power cabling, communications cabling and lighting were all renewed over the damaged area. The road surface was renewed over a length of about 500 feet (150 m). The Port Authority decided that the tunnel could not be closed completely for the duration of the reconstruction. Instead, the south tube was closed at 8 p.m. each night, after which hundreds of feet of mobile scaffold and other equipment was hauled in. Reconstruction work was carried out overnight until approximately 4:30 a.m., at which time the construction equipment and scaffold was hauled out before the tunnel re-opened at 6 a.m.It's a Brand-New Construction Job Every Night in the Holland Tunnel, Engineering News Record, July 21, 1949, pp. 32-34 The repairs were completed by mid-August 1949.Restoration of Fire-Seared Holland Tunnel, Construction Methods and Equipment. vol. 31, no. 8, August 1949, pp. 34-38 = Restrictions = At the time, the driver of the truck could only be charged with a misdemeanor, which carried a maximum fine of $50 and a jail sentence of up to five days. Thus, the driver was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing. After the fire, the Port Authority advocated for the enactment of stiffer fines in both the New York and New Jersey legislatures. Both states' legislative chambers introduced bills to that effect, but New York delayed the passage of its bill until May 1950. The aftermath of the fire also prompted an investigation from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, as well as scrutiny from insurance companies. The Port Authority wanted the Interstate Commerce Commission to perform spot-checks on interstate trucking companies, but the ICC only had a staff of twenty people to do this job. The Port Authority ultimately decided to randomly search some of the 16,000 trucks that entered the tunnel each day, although in reality, the authority could only search one percent of each day's truck traffic. Civic suits were filed against the trucking company as well as the manufacturer of the carbon disulfide. The trucking company whose truck had been involved, Apex Inc., was formally banned from using the tunnel in 1950.

German card Sample French EHIC Slovenian card The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) is issued free of charge and allows anyone who is insured by or covered by a statutory social security scheme of the EEA countries, Switzerland and the United Kingdom to receive medical treatment in another member state free or at a reduced cost, if that treatment becomes necessary during their visit (for example, due to illness or an accident), or if they have a chronic pre- existing condition which requires care such as kidney dialysis. The term of validity of the card varies according to the issuing country. The intention of the scheme is to allow people to continue their stay in a country without having to return home for medical care; as such, it does not cover people who have visited a country for the purpose of obtaining medical care, nor does it cover non-urgent care that can be delayed until the individual returns to their home country (for example, most dental care). The costs not covered by self-liability fees are paid by the issuing country, which is usually the country of residence but may also be the country where one receives the most pension from.https://www.theguardian.com/society/reality- check/2015/aug/11/are-foreigners-gaming-nhs-pay-medical-treatment-abroad-ehic It only covers healthcare which is normally covered by a statutory health care system in the visited country, so it does not render travel insurance obsolete. The card was phased in from 1 June 2004 and throughout 2005, becoming the sole healthcare entitlement document on 1 January 2006. The card is applicable in all French overseas departments (Martinique, Guadeloupe, R√©union, and French Guiana) as they are part of the EEA, but not non-EEA dependent territories such as Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Aruba, or French Polynesia. However, there are agreements for the use of the EHIC in the Faroe Islands and Greenland, even though they are not in the EEA. The reason for the existence of this card, is that the right to health care in Europe is based on the country of legal residence, not the country of citizenship. Therefore, a passport is not enough to receive health care. It is however possible that a photo ID document is asked for, since the European Health Insurance Card does not contain a photo. In some cases, even if a person is covered by the health insurance of an EU country, one is not eligible for a European Health Insurance Card. For instance, in Romania, a person who is currently insured has to have been insured for the previous five years to be eligible. Romania is also the only participating country where not all permanent residents are covered by a health insurance. Due to these reasons the Romanian Roma people typically neither have European insurance cards nor is their costs paid by the country of residence. It replaced the following medical forms: * E110 - For international road hauliers * E111 - For tourists * E119 - For unemployed people/job seekers * E128 - For students and workers in another member state Third party application processors European Health Insurance cards are provided free to all legal residents of participating countries. There are however various businesses who act as non-official agents on behalf of individuals, arranging supply of the cards in return for payment, often offering additional services such as the checking of applications for errors and general advice or assistance. This has proved extremely controversial. In 2010 the British government moved against companies that invited people to pay for the free EHIC, falsely implying that through payment the applicant could speed up the process. Participating member states The 32 participating member states, 27 EU and the United Kingdom (blue) and 4 EFTA (green). As of 2020, 32 countries in Europe participate: the 30 member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) plus Switzerland and the United Kingdom. This includes the 27 member states of the European Union (EU) and 4 member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), as well as the UK while it is in the so called transition period after it withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020.            The Channel Islands and Isle of Man do not supply coverage under the EHIC, and their residents are not eligible for EHICs. Controversy In August 2015 the Daily Mail ran a story about abuse of the EHIC system in which a card was issued to its undercover Hungarian reporter who ‚Äúobtained the card after visiting the UK for less than one day‚Äù after another journalist posed as her landlord and presented a GP with the tenancy agreement of a property that neither occupied in order to get an NHS number. It claimed that \\"foreigners were charging the NHS for care in their own country.\\" As The Guardian pointed out, the NHS issued a card to an individual that wasn‚Äôt eligible to receive the card because a GP was duped into issuing an NHS number, and it was unclear what benefit would accrue as a result. The Huffington Post reported that only nine instances of low-level fraud involving the EHIC in the UK had been discovered in five years with a combined cost of ¬£712.56.

It is one of four high schools in Newmarket under the jurisdiction of the York Region District School Board and currently educates approximately 1400 students from Grades 9 to 12. The phoenix and the Viking are the school's symbols and the school's colours are purple and gold.http://www.newmarket- highschool.com/ Retrieved February 25, 2009. History The school was founded in 1843 as a \\"grammar school\\", located on Raglan Street and Millard Avenue in Newmarket. As an institution, Newmarket High School is the fourth oldest high school in Ontario (oldest being Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute c. 1792 and Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School c. 1806 and Jarvis Collegiate Institute c. 1807) and oldest in York Region. This original school, which could accommodate 46 students, was built at a cost of $75. However, by the 1870s, Newmarket's growth had rendered the original school inadequate to the task of educating the town's youth. So, in 1876, at a cost of $6,000, a new building was constructed at the southeast corner of Pearson and Prospect Streets in Newmarket, where the school was located for most of its history. On March 16, 1893, a temperamental wood-burning furnace put an end to this building and its additions when it set off a fire that burnt the school to the ground. In 1894, a new building was built on the same site, incorporating the innovation of electricity. This building stood until March 31, 1928, when yet another fire, this one of mysterious origin, once again utterly reduced the school to ashes. The fires led to the adoption of the orange Phoenix bird as the school's official symbol. The same year, yet another new school was built on the Pearson Street site by George Roper Gouinlock (son of George Wallace Gouinlock), this one hailed as ‚Äúone of the most modernized educational institutions in the Dominion of Canada.‚Äù This building stood for decades and underwent many additions and renovations over the years, most notably a major addition consisting of a classroom block and an additional gymnasium in the late 1950s, and a new school library in the 1960s. Despite the additions, however, the 1960s saw an increasingly intolerable situation developing at Newmarket District High School, as it was then known. The school was overcrowded to the extent that not only did students have to share lockers, but the school day was also run in two shifts to accommodate everyone. The situation was addressed in 1962, when Huron Heights Secondary School was opened, providing Newmarket with a second high school. By the 1990s, however, it had become clear that the existing building could no longer cope with local population growth and its facilities were becoming increasingly outdated. Plans were made to move the school to yet another site. This move (to the school's current location) was completed in October 1996, with the previous building briefly housing Newmarket Public School before being torn down in 2000 and now site of a small parkette and residential neighbourhood. A significant portion of NHS's graduating classes goes on to pursue post-secondary education at universities across Canada (mostly in Ontario). The most popular destinations include McMaster University, Wilfrid Laurier University, Carleton University, University of Western Ontario, and Brock University, University of Waterloo, University of Toronto, and Queen's University. The \\"fourth incarnation\\" as it appeared in June 1981 Current academic programs offered at Newmarket High School include a gifted/enriched program, Advanced Placement courses, and most recently, a French immersion program. Sports and athletics Newmarket High School sports teams are known as the NHS Raiders (logo is a ferocious looking Viking pillager whose current incarnation is very similar to that of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League). The Raiders field teams in: *Canadian Football *Girls' Flag Football *Varsity Field Hockey *Boys'/Girls' Volleyball *Track and field *Curling *Swimming *Badminton *Ultimate *Coed Cheerleading (currently not available) *Boys'/Girls' Basketball *Golf *Hockey *Boys' Baseball *Girls' Slow-Pitch Softball Notable student groups The Current Incarnation of the School Newmarket High School boasts one of the finest arts and music programs in York Region as well as an excellent athletic program and an active and prominent student council. The school has long served as the home of the Newmarket-area gifted/enrichment program. York Region's French immersion program moved to Newmarket High from Aurora High School and Keswick High School in September 2007.

The Social Justice Committee began a fundraiser in which $1 400 was donated to the foundation by selling jewellery made by African children. In spring 2005, the committee did a penny drive, which raised another $500. Other clubs such as Youth Alive, a Christian group that has been involved in programs spearheaded in large part thanks to the efforts of Mr. Pichora and Mr. Finkle, and has recently been student-led, encourage student participation in volunteer efforts and other causes. Fundraising drives for Hurricane Katrina victims and the Kids Help Phone are two examples of some of Youth Alive's contributions. However, youth alive has recently been focusing on more faith related topics where a leader of the group offered to answer questions about God, Faith and the like via anonymous text messaging or by coming to the group which meets Mondays after school. The group's primary goals as of 2011, have been to a) discuss and encourage the conduct of a Christian high school student, and b) to inform the school about what Jesus has done, and why it matters to them. The atrium of the current N.H.S. Student groups often make banners that are attached to the railings of either hallways, as shown in the image. The Newmarket High School instrumental and jazz bands have been a key fixture of the Arts and Music program at the school for many years, and have competed in numerous regional and provincial competitions with a great deal of success. The band received Gold level ratings at the annual Canada's Wonderland spring Music Alive Festival in 2003 and 2004, and a Silver rating in 2005. NHS Music Night, held twice a year ‚Äì normally in December during first semester and April or May in second semester ‚Äì has also become a popular department tradition and received critical acclaim from local publications such as The Era Banner and York Region This Month.

Lovell, Max Neiman, Robert Kneisel, Adam Rose, and Charles Tobin (June 1979). Federal and State Mandating on Local Governments: Report to the National Science Foundation. Riverside, CA: University of California, p. 32 An unfunded mandate is a statute or regulation that requires a state or local government to perform certain actions, with no money provided for fulfilling the requirements. Public individuals or organizations can also be required to fulfill public mandates. As of 1992, 172 federal mandates obligated state or local governments to fund programs to some extent.Dilger, Robert J., and Richard S. Beth.

Beginning with the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the United States federal government has designed laws that require state and local government spending to promote national goals.\\"Voting Rights Act.\\" America's Historical Documents. 8 April 2012. . During the 1970s, the national government promoted education, mental health, and environmental programs by implementing grant projects at a state and local level; the grants were so common that the federal assistance for these programs made up over a quarter of state and local budgets.Salamon, Lester M., and Michael S. Lund. Beyond Privatization: The Tools of Government Action. Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute, 1989. The rise in federal mandates led to more mandate regulation. During the Reagan Administration, Executive Order 12291 and the State and Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981 were passed, which implemented a careful examination of the true costs of federal unfunded mandates.Public law 97-108.United States. Cong. House. House Committee on Rules. Statement. By Alice M. Rivlin. H. Doc. Congressional Budget Office, 1981. Print. More reform for federal mandates came in 1995 with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), which promoted a Congressional focus on the costs imposed onto intergovernmental entities and the private sector because of federal mandates.Anderson, Stacy, and Russell Constantine.

Background An \\"intergovernmental mandate\\" generally refers to the responsibilities or activities that one level of government imposes on another by legislative, executive or judicial action.Lex, Leo. \\"Intergovernmental Mandates in Federal Legislation,\\" CBO Economic and Budget Issue Brief, (July: 2009). According to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), an intergovernmental mandate can take various forms: *An enforceable duty ‚Äì this refers to any type of legislation, statute or regulation that either requires or proscribes an action of state or local governments, excluding actions imposed as conditions of receiving federal aid.Congressional Budget Office. \\"Identifying Intergovernmental Mandates,\\" Economic and Budget Issue Brief. Jan 2005. 2. *Certain changes in large entitlement programs ‚Äì this refers to instances when new conditions or reductions in large entitlement programs, providing $5 billion or more annually to state or local governments, are imposed by the federal government. *A reduction in federal funding for an existing mandate ‚Äì this refers to a reduction or elimination of federal funding authorized to cover the costs of an existing mandate. A 1993 study conducted by Price Waterhouse, sponsored by the National Association of Counties, determined that in fiscal year 1993 counties in the US spent $4.8 billion for twelve unfunded federal mandates.Price Waterhouse letter to the Honorable Barbara Sheen Todd, National Association of Counties, 25 October 1993. Medicaid was one of these twelve unfunded mandates, and comprised the second largest item in state budgets, accounting for almost 13 percent of state general revenues in 1993.Johnston, Jocelyn. \\"The Medicaid Mandates of the 1980s: An Intergovernmental Perspective,\\" Public Budgeting and Finance (Spring, 1997), 3‚Äì34. Mandates can be applied either vertically or horizontally.Herzfeld, Daniel. \\"Accountability and the Nondelegation of Unfunded Mandates: A Public Choice Analysis of the Supreme Court's Tenth Amendment Federalism Jurisprudence,\\" George Mason Law Review. 419. (1998‚Äì1999) Vertically applied mandates are directed by a level of government at a single department or program. Conversely, horizontally applied, or \\"crosscutting\\", mandates refer to mandates that affect various departments or programs.Lovell, Chatherine and Tobin, Charles. \\"The Mandate Issue,\\" Public Administration Review, Vol. 41, No. 3 (May‚ÄìJune, 1981). 318‚Äì31. For example, a mandate requiring county health departments to provide outpatient mental health programs would be considered a vertically applied mandate, whereas a requirement that all offices in a given jurisdiction to become handicap-accessible would be considered a horizontally applied mandate. History Federal unfunded mandates can be traced back to the post-World War II years, when the federal government initiated national programs in education, mental health services, and environmental protection.Smith, Tom W. 1990. \\"Liberal and Conservative Trends in the United States since World War II.\\" Public Opinion Quarterly 54:479‚Äì50 The method for implementing these projects at the state and local level was to involve state and local governments. In the 1970s, the federal government utilized grants as a way to increase state and local participation, which resulted in federal assistance constituting over 25 percent of state and local budgets. The first wave of major mandates occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, concerning civil rights, education, and the environment.Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief. 1982. Reagan administration achievements in regulatory relief for state and local governments: A progress report. Washington, D.C. The arrival of the Reagan administration ostensibly undermined various federal mandate efforts, as the executive branch promised to decrease federal regulatory efforts. For example, the passage of Executive Order 12291 required a cost-benefit analysis and an Office of Management and Budget clearance on proposed agency regulations, and the State and Local Cost Estimate Act of 1981 required the Congressional Budget Office to determine the state and local cost effects of proposed federal legislation moving through the Legislative Branch. However, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) reported that, during the 1980s, more major intergovernmental regulatory programs were enacted than during the 1970s.Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, Federal Regulation of State and Local Governments: The Mixed Record of the 1980s, A-126 (Washington, DC: ACIR, 1993). According to a 1995 Brookings Institution report, in 1980 there were 36 laws that qualified as unfunded mandates. Despite opposition from the Reagan administration and George H. W. Bush administration, an additional 27 laws that could be categorized as unfunded mandates went into effect between 1982 and 1991.Dilulio, John and Don Kettl, Fine Print: The Contract with America, Devolution, and the Administrative Realities of American Federalism (Washington, D.C.: Brookings Institution, 1995), p. 41. The U.S. Supreme Court has been involved in deciding the federal government's role in the U.S. governmental system based on constitutionality.\\"A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court\\" (PDF). United States Supreme Court. Retrieved 2009-12-31. During the period between the New Deal era and the mid-1980s the Court generally utilized an expansive interpretation of the interstate commerce clause and the 14th Amendment to validate the growth of the federal government's involvement in domestic policymaking.Lawson, Gary. \\"The Rise and Rise of the Administrative State\\". Harvard Law Review. 1237‚Äì41 (1994). For example, the 1985 Supreme Court case Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority affirmed the ability for the federal government to directly regulate state and local governmental affairs.Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 105 S. Ct. 1005 (1985). The increase of mandates in the 1980s and 1990s incited state and local protest.Gullo, Theresa A. and Janet M. Kelly, \\"Federal Unfunded Mandate Reform: A First-Year Retrospective\\", Public Administration Review, Vol. 58, (Sept. 1998). 380. In October 1993, state and local interest groups sponsored a National Unfunded Mandates Day, which involved press conferences and appeals to congressional delegations about mandate relief. In early 1995, Congress passed unfunded mandate reform legislation.Public Law 104-4, 109 Stat. 48. In 1992 the Court determined in various cases that the Constitution provides state and locality protections concerning unfunded mandate enactments.New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992). For example, in the 1992 case New York v. United States, the Court struck down a federal law that regulated the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, which utilized the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to require states to dispose of the radioactive material. Examples  Unfunded mandates are most commonly utilized in regulation of civil rights, anti-poverty programs and environmental protection programs.Lowi, Theodore J., Benjamin Ginsberg, Kenneth A. Shepsle, and Stephen Ansolabehere. \\"Federalism and the Separation of Powers.\\" American Government Power and Purpose. 11th ed. New York: W W Norton & Co, 2010. 59-60. =Clean Air Act= The Clean Air Act was passed in 1963 to support the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established on December 2, 1970, in developing research programs looking into air pollution problems and solutions.\\"History Clean Air Act  US EPA.\\" EPA. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 17 Apr. 2012. <>. The EPA received authority to research air quality. The 1970 Amendments to the Clean Air Act established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, authorized requirements for control of motor vehicle emissions, increased the federal enforcement authority but required states to implement plans to adhere to these standards.Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 110 (1970). The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970 expanded and modified the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and expanded and modified enforcement authority. The amendments increased the mandates on states to comply with the federal standards for air quality. States have had to write up State Implementation Plans, have them approved by the EPA and must also fund the implementation. =The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990= The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits discrimination based on disability, requires existing public facilities to be made accessible, requires new facilities to comply with accessibility expectations, and requires that employers provide anything a disabled employee might need, such as a sign language interpreter.Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.

Federal funding covers a variable portion of at least half of Medicaid costshttps://www.nhpf.org/library/issue- briefs/IB828_FMAP_12-11-08.pdf, and states are expected to cover the remainder. This means that any federally mandated increase in Medicaid spending forces states to spend more.Sack, Kevin, and Robert Pear. \\"Governors Fear Medicaid Costs in Health Plan.\\" The New York Times. 19 July 2009. Web. 5 Mar. 2012. . However, as state participation in Medicaid is voluntary, it is not technically an unfunded mandate. =The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001= The 2001 No Child Left Behind Act was passed in response to widespread concern about the quality of public education in America.No Child Left Behind Act, 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 1001 (2001). The act was meant to decrease the gap between students who were performing very well and students who were performing poorly. The act required schools receiving federal funding to administer statewide standardized tests to students at the end of each year. If students did not show improvement from year to year on these tests, their schools were asked to work to improve the quality of the education by hiring highly qualified teachers and by tutoring struggling students.No Child Left Behind Act, 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 1111 (2001). To continue receiving Federal grants, states had to develop plans that demonstrated their steps to improve the quality of education in their schools. The No Child Left Behind Act mandated that states fund the improvements in their schools and provide the appropriate training for less qualified teachers.No Child Left Behind Act, 20 U.S.C. ¬ß 1003 (2001). Federally mandated K-12 education is also a (mostly) unfunded mandate. Criticism  Critics argue that unfunded mandates are inefficient and are an unfair imposition of the national government on the smaller governments.St. George, James R. \\"Unfunded Mandates: Balancing State and National Needs.\\" Brookings Review Apr. 1995.

State and local governments do not always disagree with the spirit of the mandate, however, they often object to the high costs they must bear to carry out the objectives.Wellman, Nola. Unfunded Mandates Reduce Efficiency; Local Control Improves Effectiveness. Print. The debate on unfunded federal mandates is visible in cases such as New York v. United States, mentioned above. In School District of Pontiac, Michigan v. Duncan, the plaintiffs alleged that the school district need not comply with the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 because the federal government did not provide them sufficient funding; the court concluded that insufficient federal funds were not a valid reason to not comply with a federal mandate.Talbert, Kent. \\"No Child Left Behind Act: Not an \\"Unfunded Mandate\\"\\" Court Cases : Education Law Review : Elementary & Secondary School Legislation, Charter Schools & Unfunded Mandate: Kent Talbert & Rober Eitel Lawyer & Attorney. Talbert & Eitel, 21 June 2010. Web. 08 Apr. 2012. http://www.educationlawreview.com/k-12-education/court-cases/. Unfunded Mandates Reform ActPurpose= The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) was approved by the 104th Congress on March 22, 1995, and became effective October 5, 1995, during the Clinton administration.S. 1, 104th Cong., U.S. G.P.O. 25 (1995) (enacted). Print. It is public law 104-4. The official legislation summarizes the bill as being: \\"An Act: To curb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local governments; [...] and to ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and for other purposes.\\" UMRA was enacted to avoid imposing mandates, when said mandates did not include federal funding to help the SLTG (State, Local, and Tribal Governments) carry out the goals of the mandate.\\"Summary of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.\\" EPA. Environmental Protection Agency. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. . It also allowed the Congressional Budget Office to estimate the cost of mandates to SLTGs and to the private sector, and allows federal agencies issuing mandates to estimate the costs of mandates to the entities that said mandates regulate. =Application= Most of the act's provisions apply to proposed and final rules for which a notice of the proposed rule was published, and that include a Federal mandate that could result in the expenditure of funds by SLTGs or the private sector of or in excess of $100 million in any given year.S. 1, 104th Cong., U.S. G.P.O. 25 (1995) (enacted). Print. Section 424(b)(1). If a mandate meets these conditions, a written statement must be provided that includes the legal authority for the rule, a cost-benefit assessment, a description of the macroeconomic effects that the mandate will likely have, and a summary of concerns from the SLTG and how they were addressed.S. 1, 104th Cong., U.S. G.P.O. 25 (1995) (enacted). Print. Section 424(a)(2)(C). An agency enforcing the mandate must also choose the least-costly option that still achieves the goals of the mandate, as well as consult with elected officials of the SLTG to allow for their input on the implementation of the mandate and its goals.S. 1, 104th Cong., U.S. G.P.O. 25 (1995) (enacted). Print. Section 204(a). Section 203 of UMRA is a bit more extensive in that it applies to all regulatory requirements that significantly affect small governments, and requires federal agencies to provide notice of the requirements to the government(s), enable the officials of the government(s) to provide their input on the mandate, and inform and educate the government(s) on the requirements for implementation of the mandate.S. 1, 104th Cong., U.S. G.P.O. 25 (1995) (enacted). Print. Section 203(a). UMRA allows the United States Congress to decline unfunded federal mandates within legislation if such mandates are estimated to cost more than the threshold amounts estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.Dilger, Robert J., and Richard S. Beth. \\"Unfunded Mandate Reform Act: History, Impact, and Issues.\\" CRS Report for Congress (2011). Web. UMRA does not apply to \\"conditions of federal assistance; duties stemming from participation in voluntary federal programs; rules issued by independent regulatory agencies; rules issued without a general notice of proposed rulemaking; and rules and legislative provisions that cover individual constitutional rights, discrimination, emergency assistance, grant accounting and auditing procedures, national security, treaty obligations, and certain elements of Social Security\\". =Effectiveness= Ever since UMRA was proposed, it has remained unclear, how effective the legislation actually is at limiting the burdens imposed by unfunded mandates on SLTGs, and whether or not unfunded mandates need to be limited so strictly. Proponents of the Act argue that UMRA is needed to limit legislation that imposes obligations on SLTGs and that creates higher costs and less efficiency, while opponents argue that sometimes federal unfunded mandates are necessary to achieve a national goal that state and local governments don't fund voluntarily. Opponents also question the effectiveness of the bill due to the aforementioned restrictions. 2015 Unfunded Mandates and Information Transparency Act  The Act was written to amend UMRA by having the CBO compare the authorized level of funding in legislation to the costs of carrying out any changes. It was done by also amending the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The bill was introduced by Republican North Carolina Representative Virginia Foxx and passed by the House on February 4, 2015. Foxx had authored a previous version of this bill, which also passed the house, as H.R. 899 (113th Congress) in February 2014. The bill would allow private companies and trade associations to look at proposed rules before they are announced to the public. The concern is that private companies could weaken upgrades to public protections.

She spent most of their marriage in relatively close proximity to him despite his numerous military campaigns in the American Civil War and subsequent postings on the Great Plains as a commanding officer in the United States Cavalry. Left nearly destitute in the aftermath of her husband's death, she became an outspoken advocate for his legacy through her popular books and lectures. Largely as a result of her decades of campaigning on his behalf, General Custer's iconic image as the gallant fallen hero amid the glory of Custer's Last Stand was a canon of American history for almost a century after his death. Elizabeth Custer never remarried and died in 1933, four days short of her 91st birthday. She has been portrayed by a number of actresses, starting in the 1940s in films and later on television.  Early years  Elizabeth \\"Libbie\\" Bacon was born in Monroe, Michigan, in 1842, the daughter of a wealthy and influential judge and state representative, Daniel Bacon (b. 1798). Her father had profitable investments in real estate and other business ventures. Tragedy marked much of her childhood, with her three siblings and mother all dying before Elizabeth's thirteenth year. As the only one of the judge's children who would live to adulthood, her father doted on her, being charged by his dying wife to \\"...be both a mother and father...\\" to the young girl. Judge Bacon, nearly ten years later, stated \\"I have ever felt the force of these words... I feel the responsibility beyond anything in my life before or since.\\" Elizabeth Bacon was both beautiful and intelligent, graduating from a girls' seminary in June 1862 at the head of her class. Her father hoped she would make a good marriage with a man from her own elevated social status, and she rejected several suitors. She had briefly encountered her future husband George Armstrong Custer as a child, and socially met him again in the autumn of 1862, when he had returned to Monroe on leave from the first year of the American Civil War. He later wrote that he fell deeply in love with her as of their first formal meeting. She eventually returned these feelings, but her father refused to allow then-Captain Custer into the Bacon home or to permit her to meet him outside it, much less get married, as George proposed in the final week of 1862. He was from a poor, undistinguished family, and the judge hoped his daughter would have better than the life of an army wife. After Custer, just prior to the Battle of Gettysburg (where he played a significant role), was promoted to Brevet brigadier general, Judge Bacon finally relented and they were married in Monroe at the First Presbyterian Church on February 9, 1864.  Married life  Elizabeth Custer and her husband George had a loving but tumultuous relationship. Both were stubborn, opinionated, and ambitious. Their private correspondence was filled with sexually charged double entendres. ... we gave ourselves the privilege of a swift gallop... I never noticed the surroundings until I found we were almost in the midst of an Indian village, quite hidden under the bluff. My heart literally stood still. I watched the general furtively. He was as usual perfectly unmoved, and yet he well knew that this was the country where it was hardly considered that the Indian was overburdened with hospitality. ... The next day the general thought I might rather not go with him than run the risk of such frights; but I well knew there was something far worse than fears for my own personal safety. It is infinitely worse to be left behind, a prey to all the horrors of imagining what may be happening to one we love. You eat your heart slowly out with such anxiety, and to endure such suspense is simply the hardest of all trials that come to the soldier's wife. ‚Äî Elizabeth 'Libbie' Custer, from her first book Boots and Saddles, on her life and adventures with her husband. After the war, George reverted from his wartime rank of major general to his Regular Army rank of lieutenant colonel, although he did receive a brevet (honorary) promotion to major general which allowed him to wear the uniform and insignia of that rank. He was assigned to a series of dreary and unsatisfying assignments in Texas, Kansas, and the Dakota Territory. Life on the frontier outposts was difficult, and his career was plagued by problems including a court martial (brought about by his leaving the field to be with his wife). The 1876 campaign against the Sioux seemed like a chance for glory to George Armstrong Custer. The couple's final home together was at Fort Abraham Lincoln near what is now Bismarck, North Dakota. From there, the general led the Seventh Cavalry in pursuit of Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and Northern Cheyenne who refused to be confined to the reservation system.  Defender of her husband's legacy  After her husband's column was wiped out at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in June 1876, many in the press, Army, and government criticized him for blundering into a massacre. President Ulysses S. Grant publicly blamed him for the disaster. Fearing that her husband was to be made a scapegoat by history, Elizabeth Custer launched a one-woman campaign to rehabilitate her husband's image. Her assistance to Frederick Whittaker, the author of the first biography of George, helped enable the rapid production of the popular book, which praised George's career and set the tone for future biographers in the decades ahead. Elizabeth began writing articles and making speaking engagements praising the glory of what she presented as her \\"martyred\\" husband. Her three books‚ÄîBoots and Saddles (1885), Tenting on the Plains‚Äî(1887), and Following the Guidon (1890) aimed at glorifying her dead husband's memory. Though generally considered to be largely factually accurate, they were slanted in George's favor. President Taft in black hat and dress from the far left of the frame, attends the unveiling of the Custer statue in Monroe, Michigan, in 1910. Elizabeth remained utterly devoted to her husband and never remarried. Despite having spent her life traveling extensively throughout the United States (including winters in Florida) and the world, she never visited the valley of Little Big Horn. She was said to treasure a letter from President Theodore Roosevelt who stated that her husband was \\"one of my heroes\\" and \\"a shining light to all the youth of America.\\" Later that historians reexamined George's actions leading up to and during the battle and found much to criticize. After an initial period of distress dealing with her late husband's debts, Elizabeth spent her over a half-century of widowhood in financial comfort attained as the result of her literary career and lecture tours, leaving an estate of over $100,000. She died in New York City, four days before her 91st birthday, on April 4, 1933, and was buried next to her husband at West Point. A few years before her death she told a writer that her greatest disappointment was that she never had a son to bear her husband's honored name.  Portrayals in movies and television  Elizabeth Custer was portrayed by actress Olivia de Havilland in the 1941 film They Died with their Boots On, by Mary Ure in the 1967 film Custer of the West, by Blythe Danner in the 1977 television movie The Court Martial of George Armstrong Custer, and by Rosanna Arquette in the 1991 television mini-series Son of the Morning Star.

Hurwitz matrix and the Hurwitz stability criterion Namely, given a real polynomial :p(z)=a_{0}z^n+a_{1}z^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_{n-1}z+a_n the n\\\\times n square matrix : H= \\\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & a_3 & a_5 & \\\\dots & \\\\dots & \\\\dots & 0 & 0 & 0  a_0 & a_2 & a_4 & & & & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots  0 & a_1 & a_3 & & & & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots  \\\\vdots & a_0 & a_2 & \\\\ddots & & & 0 & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots  \\\\vdots & 0 & a_1 & & \\\\ddots & & a_n & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & a_0 & & & \\\\ddots & a_{n-1} & 0 & \\\\vdots  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & 0 & & & & a_{n-2} & a_n & \\\\vdots  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & & & a_{n-3} & a_{n-1} & 0  0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\dots & \\\\dots & a_{n-4} & a_{n-2} & a_n \\\\end{pmatrix}. is called Hurwitz matrix corresponding to the polynomial p. It was established by Adolf Hurwitz in 1895 that a real polynomial with a_0 > 0 is stable (that is, all its roots have strictly negative real part) if and only if all the leading principal minors of the matrix H(p) are positive: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta_1(p) &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} a_{1} \\\\end{vmatrix} &&=a_{1} > 0 \\\\[2mm] \\\\Delta_2(p) &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} a_{1} & a_{3}  a_{0} & a_{2}  \\\\end{vmatrix} &&= a_2 a_1 - a_0 a_3 > 0\\\\[2mm] \\\\Delta_3(p) &= \\\\begin{vmatrix} a_{1} & a_{3} & a_{5}  a_{0} & a_{2} & a_{4}  0 & a_{1} & a_{3}  \\\\end{vmatrix} &&= a_3 \\\\Delta_2 - a_1 (a_1 a_4 - a_0 a_5 ) > 0 \\\\end{align} and so on. The minors \\\\Delta_k(p) are called the Hurwitz determinants. Similarly, if a_0 < 0 then the polynomial is stable if and only if the principal minors have alternating signs starting with a negative one. Hurwitz stable matrices In engineering and stability theory, a square matrix A is called a stable matrix (or sometimes a Hurwitz matrix) if every eigenvalue of A has strictly negative real part, that is, :\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{Re}}[\\\\lambda_i] < 0\\\\, for each eigenvalue \\\\lambda_i. A is also called a stability matrix, because then the differential equation :\\\\dot x = A x is asymptotically stable, that is, x(t)\\\\to 0 as t\\\\to\\\\infty. If G(s) is a (matrix-valued) transfer function, then G is called Hurwitz if the poles of all elements of G have negative real part. Note that it is not necessary that G(s), for a specific argument s, be a Hurwitz matrix ‚Äî it need not even be square. The connection is that if A is a Hurwitz matrix, then the dynamical system :\\\\dot x(t)=A x(t) + B u(t) :y(t)=C x(t) + D u(t)\\\\, has a Hurwitz transfer function. Any hyperbolic fixed point (or equilibrium point) of a continuous dynamical system is locally asymptotically stable if and only if the Jacobian of the dynamical system is Hurwitz stable at the fixed point. The Hurwitz stability matrix is a crucial part of control theory. A system is stable if its control matrix is a Hurwitz matrix. The negative real components of the eigenvalues of the matrix represent negative feedback. Similarly, a system is inherently unstable if any of the eigenvalues have positive real components, representing positive feedback.

The tax wedge is the deviation from the equilibrium price/quantity (P^* and Q^*, respectively) as a result of the taxation of a good. Because of the tax, consumers pay more for the good (P_c) than they did before the tax, and suppliers receive less for the good (P_s) than they did before the tax . Put differently, the tax wedge is the difference between what consumers pay and what producers receive (net of tax) from a transaction. The tax effectively drives a \\"wedge\\" between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product. Following from the Law of Supply and Demand, as the price to consumers increases, and the price received by suppliers decreases, the quantity that each wishes to trade will decrease. After a tax is introduced, a new equilibrium is reached, where consumers pay more (P^* \\\\rightarrow P_c), suppliers receive less (P^* \\\\rightarrow P_s), and the quantity exchanged falls (Q^* \\\\rightarrow Q_t). The difference between P_c and P_s will be equivalent to the size of the per-unit tax.  Implications of a tax wedge  Deadweight loss = The filled-in \\"wedge\\" created by a tax actually represents the amount of deadweight loss created by the tax. Deadweight loss is the reduction in social efficiency (producer and consumer surplus) from preventing trades for which benefits exceed costs. Deadweight loss occurs with a tax because a higher price for consumers, and a lower price received by suppliers, reduces the quantity of the good sold. Thus, the equilibrium quantity of a taxed good is lower than the equilibrium quantity when the same good is not taxed. The deadweight loss created by the tax is equal to {1 \\\\over 2}\\\\times \\\\ Tax \\\\ \\\\times (Q^*-Q_t), represented by the shaded triangle in the figure. 320x320px 320x320px = Tax incidence = There are two types of tax incidence or tax burden created by a tax: the statutory incidence of a tax and the economic incidence of a tax. Typically, a general reference to \\"tax incidence\\" refers to the economic incidence of a tax. The statutory incidence of a tax falls on the party, producers or consumers, that has to physically send a check to the government in the amount of a tax. For example, if a person directly pays his or her income tax to the government (with no employer withholding), the statutory burden would fall on consumers. If a tax is imposed on the producers of gasoline, however, the statutory burden would fall on producers. The economic incidence of a tax falls on the party that bears the actual cost of the tax. Put another way, economic incidence reflects the actual change in an individual's or firm's resources due to the tax. The statutory incidence of the tax is irrelevant to the economic incidence of the tax. In fact, the economic incidence is completely determined by the elasticity of supply and demand. Typically, both producers and consumers bear some portion of the economic incidence of the tax, but these portions do not have to be equal. The party with the more inelastic (steeper) curve bears more of the tax. For example, consumers of tobacco products typically bear more of the tax on tobacco, because they are addicted to the product and their consumption is not strongly affected by price changes (demand is inelastic). Producers bear more of the tax when supply is inelastic; for example, producers of beachfront hotels would bear more of a tax on hotels and accept lower prices for their product, because a change in price would not have a large effect on the quantity of beachfront hotels. These examples are illustrated graphically (right). The economic incidence on consumers is equal to P_c - P^*, and the incidence on producers is equal to P^* - P_s. Full shifting of a tax occurs when one party in a transaction bears all of the tax burden. When demand is perfectly inelastic, the tax burden is fully shifted onto consumers; when supply is perfectly inelastic, the tax burden is fully shifted onto producers. In the long run, however, supply and demand both become more elastic: consumers' preferences for a product can change (cigarette smokers can quit smoking), and suppliers can choose to reduce their investment in, or leave, the market (a hotel chain can decide to sell its beachfront properties). This means that the economic incidence on consumers and producers can change in the long run.

He was the first British pilot to exceed Mach 1 in a British aircraft in level flight (P.1A),John Derry was the first British Pilot to exceed Mach 1 but did so in a shallow dive in the de Havilland DH 108 and the first to fly a British aircraft at Mach 2 (P.1B). During the Second World War, he flew more than five hundred operational sorties. He also spent several months as a Hawker experimental test pilot developing the Hawker Typhoon and Tempest, and was responsible for introducing these types into operational squadron service. He pioneered the ground attack capabilities of the Typhoon and led the air to air campaign against the V-1 flying bomb In 1945 he commanded the Air Fighting Development Squadron at RAF Central Fighter Establishment, before leaving the service in 1947. During his subsequent career as English Electric Aviation chief test pilot (and later for BAC), he directed the flight test programmes of the Canberra, the Lightning, and TSR-2, making the maiden flight of each type. When he retired from test flying in 1968, he had flown 167 different types during a total of 5,100hr and 8,000 flights‚Äîof which more than 1,100 were supersonic. He set three Atlantic records in the Canberra, including Britannia Trophy for the first double Atlantic flight in one day. In 1971, he became Panavia flight operations director, responsible for the testing of the Tornado, retiring in August 1979 following the maiden flight of the first production Tornado. After retirement he contributed to aviation journals and wrote a number of books about his experiences. Beamont was a careful pilot who understood the capabilities of the aircraft he flew. He was proud that he had never broken an aircraft, nor had to bail out or eject. Even when his Tempest was shot down, he had made the best landing possible in the circumstances and got out, free of injury. Early life Roland Prosper Beamont was born on 10 August 1920 at 8 Private Road, Enfield, Middlesex, the son of Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Clement Beamont, a trade officer with the Foreign Office, and Dorothy Mary, n√©e Haynes. He grew up in Chichester, Sussex, and from an early age was fascinated by aviation. His first flight was in 1926; a barnstormer in an Avro 504 landed near his home and took Beamont (aged 6) and his father up for 5 Shillings. Thereafter, Beamont saved all his pocket money to spend it on flying books and model aeroplanes His second fight was in 1932 in a Fox Moth piloted by C.W.A. Scott. He spent his school holidays, cycling to nearby Tangmere aerodrome to watch the RAF Hawker Furies fly. His parents supported his interest in aviation and had him educated at Eastbourne College from 1934 to 1937 with the aim of admission into the RAF College Cranwell In addition, his father organised two air experience flights (under the RAF's schools assistance scheme) the first at Tangmere, with No. 1 Squadron, the second at RAF Halton in which Beamont (aged 16) was allowed to take the controls in an Avro Tutor. Beamont was not academic and failed his school certificate in 1938. He retook it after private tuition, and scraped enough passes to apply for a short service commission. On 2 September 1939 he reported to No. 13 Elementary and Reserve Training School at White Waltham Airfield for ab initio flying training as a civilian. His subsequent commission was dependent on passing the course (i.e. going solo after 15 hours tuition), which he only just managed. He was posted to No. 13 Advanced Flying Training School, Drem, flying Hawker Harts and then Hurricanes. He passed out as a pilot officer, graded exceptional, on 21 October, and in November 1939, he was sent to France to join No. 87 Squadron. RAF careerHurricane= Pilots and ground crew gather around the fuselage Balkenkreuz from No 87 Squadron's first kill, a Heinkel 111 on 2 November 1939. Watching on the right is Pilot Officer Roland Beamont (in flying helmet, with initials on his flying jacket) Beamont arrived in France with 15 hours experience flying Hurricanes. During the winter of 1939, there was little opportunity for the inexperienced pilots to fly and Beamont was assigned to the operations room. As a result of a high fever, he was sent to a hospital in Dieppe, but after two weeks absence he risked being removed from squadron strength and put into the pilots pool. To avoid this, he persuaded his father, who was also stationed in France, to provide a car to drive him back to the squadron. The spring of 1940 provided more opportunity for action. In March he took part in an interception of a Heinkel 111, on 8 May he shot down a Dornier Do 17. When No. 87 Squadron returned from France they were initially stationed at Church Fenton, before relocating to Exeter, as part of 10 Group, defending South Western England. During the Battle of Britain, Beamont claimed the following: a Junkers Ju 88 on 24 July, two Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 15 August, a Dornier Do 17 and a Messerschmitt Bf 109 on 25 August. Beamont described the period thus: During the air raids of The Blitz, No. 87 Squadron was assigned night fighter duties defending Bristol. Directing the Hurricanes by searchlight was largely ineffective. In frustration, Beamont suggested that on moonlit nights they should cross the channel and strafe the Luftwaffe aerodromes. This tactic was adopted by Group and proved successful, with Beamont taking part in the destruction of several aircraft. Three Hawker Hurricane Mark IIBs of No. 79 Squadron RAF. The pilots were, Sqn Ldr G D Haysom (NV-B), Flt Lt R P Beamont (nearest aircraft,'NV-M'), and Flt Lt L T Bryant-Fenn (NV-F). In May 1941 he was transferred to No. 79 Squadron RAF as flight commander, and in June he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Beamont set about raising the morale of his new flight by engaging them in night flying and formation aerobatics. In September he transported a WAAF cipher officer to a dance at RAF Pembrey in his single-seat Hurricane because the squadron's Tiger Moth was unavailable. This action would lead to his court martial in December 1941 (and his marriage in October 1942). The court found him guilty and was severely reprimanded by Group Captain Richard Atcherley. When his tour of duty ended in December 1941, he was offered the position of Leigh-Mallory's personal aide. Instead, he chose to keep flying and to accept a position as a production test pilot at Hawker's. While he had 800 hours flying Hurricanes he was by his own admission, ignorant of the problems of aircraft stability, trim and control balance. To remedy this, Hawker's civilian test pilots, Bill Humble, Hubert Broad and particularly Philip Lucas mentored him in the art and science of test flying. At Hawker's, while most of his flying was production test flights of Hurricanes, he did take part in some of the development flying of the early production Typhoons. On his first cross country flight in a Typhoon, while delivering it to Gloster's, its main oil pipe failed. He managed an emergency landing in a small field being used as a flying school, attracting a rebuke from the chief flying instructor. In February 1942 he took over the vibration programme of the Typhoon. Flying aircraft fitted with vibrographs to determine the effectiveness of propellor balancing improvements and the sprung seat mounts¬∑ The engineering work to reduce cockpit vibration in the Typhoon was led by Frederick Page, who would later lead the Lightning and TSR2 development =Typhoon= Beamont was keen to resume operational flying in one of the two Typhoon squadrons. He was initially posted to No. 56 Squadron, as a supernumerary flight commander in July 1942, followed by a permanent posting to No. 609 Squadron RAF in October. When its commanding officer Paul Richie left in January 1943, Beamont was promoted to squadron leader. Fighter Command had concerns about the Typhoon's safety and serviceability because during the first nine months of its introduction, the losses due to structural and engine failure were greater than caused by enemy action. As commanding officer of the few Typhoon squadrons, Beamont was instrumental in arguing for keeping the aircraft in RAF service against increasing establishment resistance. He was called to meetings with Air Chief Marshall Trafford Leigh Mallory and AOC Hugh Saunders to discuss the future of the Typhoon. Beamont argued that he had faith in the manufacturers to correct its faults and that the basic design of the aircraft was sound: it was easy to fly, a stable firing platform, it was both faster and more manoeuvrable than contemporary Luftwaffe fighters. Leigh Mallory was in agreement and the Typhoon was saved. However, it was Beamont and his squadron's actions over the winter of 1942/43 that would start to establish the Typhoon's reputation. From March 1942 the Southern coast of England had been under attack from Luftwaffe fighter bombers. No 609 squadron was relocated to RAF Manston and in November standing patrols were set up from dawn till dusk to intercept raiding Fw 190 Jagdbombers. At the same time Beamont was developing the use of the Typhoon as a night intruder. To repeat his earlier initiative with the Hurricane, he had the illumination of his displays and reflector sight modified to be compatible with night flying. Starting on the night of 17 November, he flew a series of solo sorties; attacking trains on the Calais-Amiens-Paris line to demonstrate that the Typhoon was both safe to fly at night and an effective ground attack aircraft. No. 91 Squadron's Spitfire XII were also deployed to intercept the raiders. Inevitably, amid inter-squadron rivalry, the question of the fastest fighter arose. Beamont challenged the CO of No. 91 Squadron to an air race, with Beamont's Typhoon being the clear victor over the Spitfire XII.In a speed trial, held at Farnborough in July 1942, the Griffon-engined Spifire Mk XII prototype (DP845) piloted by Jeffrey Quill was demonstrated to be faster than a contemporary Hawker Typhoon and a captured Focke-Wulf Fw 190. He was awarded a bar to his DSO in June 1943, his destruction of 13 trains and numerous lorries being noted. =Tempest= Hawker Tempest of Beamont's Wing at RAF Newchurch, 1944. In mid-May 1943 he returned to Hawker's as a test pilot, performing experimental testing of both the Typhoon and new Tempest. In February 1944 AOC Hugh Saunders invited Beamont to form the first Tempest wing (No. 150), with the rank of acting wing commander. At this time the available Tempests were dispersed around maintenance units; Beamont had to fly between the units to locate them. By May 1944 his wing had become operational with two Tempest squadrons (No 3 and No 486) and one with Spitfire IX. Their first operations were ground attack sorties against trains or airfields. On D-Day+2 (8 June) the wing shot down three Bf 109s over the invasion beaches without loss, the first one credited to Beamont and the first to a Tempest. No. 3 Squadron RAF at Newchurch Advanced Landing Ground, Kent. From his airfield at Newchurch, Beamont witnessed the first intrusion by V-1 flying bombs as they flew towards London at dawn on 14 June; two days later (16 June) his wing was switched to intercepting them. In the following days, he and his pilots would trial attack tactics by day and discuss their effectiveness in the evening. For instance, Beamont discovered first hand that attacking a V-1 at close range could result in a hazardous explosion. He established that the best attack was to approach from astern at an acute angle with the cannons synchronised to 200yds (180m). On at least one occasion Beamont defeated a V-1 by carefully sliding his wing-tip under that of the V-1 and flipping it. His fifth V-1 kill on the evening of 19 June made him the first V-1. ace. By the end of the V-1 campaign, 150 Wing had shot down 638, with Beamont accounting for 32. Around this time Beamont met Ernest Hemingway, who had flown over from America to report on the D-Day invasion and spent time in 150 Wing's officer's mess. On 2 October 1944, now based on the continent at Volkel, the Netherlands, he achieved his ninth and final kill of the war when he shot down a Fw 190 near Nijmegen. On 12 October, on his 492nd operational mission, while attacking a heavily defended troop-train near Bocholt his Tempest's radiator was hit by flak. He crash landed without injury and became a prisoner of war (PoW). Confined firstly to Stalag Luft III at ≈ªaga≈Ñ in Lower Silesia, then to Stalag III-A at Luckenwalde, Brandenburg, he remained a PoW until the end of the war in Europe (May 1945). Beamont and other POWs were detained for a few weeks by Soviet forces, and repatriated in late May. AT RAF Chilbolton Beamont formed the first wing of Hawker Tempest IIs in preparation for planned invasion of Japan. The Tempests were to escort bombers of Tiger Force over Japan. The operation was cancelled following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In May 1946 he was awarded the American Distinguished Flying Cross. Test pilotMeteor and Vampire= At the end of the war Beamont was faced with a choice: a career as a test pilot or a permanent commission in the RAF. In October 1944 Philip Lucas had flown in to Vokel and invited him to become Hawker's deputy experimental test pilot after his tour. Unfortunately, during Beamont's period of captivity this position had been filled, but through Lucas he obtained an offer as a test pilot with Glosters. At the same time, he was appointed to the RAF's Air Fighting Development Unit, and applied for a permanent commission. The decision was made during a meeting with Sir James Robb, who indicated that the next phase of his RAF career was likely to be seven years behind a desk. At Gloster, Beamont took the Meteor F4 through its early experimental test flight programme, culminating in a flight at 632 mph on 9 July 1946 in preparation for the official air speed record by the RAF. In August 1946 he moved to de Havilland as a demonstration pilot, with the aim of moving to experimental flying (particularly the DH 108 Swallow), however apart from demonstrations in the DH Vampire at air shows, the work was not challenging. =Canberra= The lack of opportunity to transfer to experimental flying at de Havilland caused him to look for more a demanding role. In October 1946 he was interviewed by Teddy Petter and Freddie Page for chief test pilot at English Electric, who at that time were designing Britain's first jet bomber. Petter was concerned about Beamont's lack of engineering qualifications, but Page pointed out they would \\"have plenty of good engineers but what was needed was a test pilot with operational experience\\". Beamont moved to English Electric in May 1947. At this time English Electric were manufacturing D.H Vampires under licence but had no original aircraft to conduct research, particularly to explore the effects of compressibility. From his experience at Glosters, Beamont suggested to Petter that they borrow a Meteor F.4 to carry out high altitude research. Beamont made the first experimental test flight from the Warton Aerodrome in a Meteor on 28 August 1947. To get Beamont experience of flying big jets the Ministry of Supply organised a visit to the United States to fly the North American B-45 Tornado, the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and the Martin XB-48. When he arrived in May 1948 only the B-45 was airworthy. Through William.G.A Perring (the director of the RAE) he was able to persuade the US authorities to give him permission to fly one of the only two XP-86 Sabres then built, based at Muroc Field. Briefed by test pilot George Welch, Beamont flew the XP-86 in May of that year, exceeding an indicated Mach 1 on his one and only flight in the aircraft, the third person to do so in the XP-86.http://www.airsceneuk.org.uk/oldstuff/2005/bee/bee.htmIt is likely that these flights were not supersonic. Investigations would later prove that the pitot tube on the XP-86 was affected by shock waves and the true Mach number was closer to 0.98. Beamont also noted that there was no sonic bang as there was in his later supersonic flights On 13 May 1949 he made the first flight of the Canberra prototype (VN799). Due to its reserves of power and low wing- loading the Canberra was highly manoeuvrable at any altitude, and Beamont would use this to advantage in his flying.On 13 September 1949 he demonstrated it at the Farnborough air show. Flight magazine described Beamont's display as \\"exhilarating\\", stating that \\"A new aircraft has never been more convincingly demonstrated\\" . This display was only marred by the inadvertent jettison of the 'automatic-observer' when Beamont opened the bomb bay doors to slow the aircraft, necessary because the prototype had no air-brakes. On 23 February 1951 he presented it to US Department of Defense officials contributing to the decision in the April for Canberras to be built under licence by the Glenn L. Martin Company as the B-57. Beamont set two transatlantic records in the Canberra. Taking advantage of a delivery flight to Glenn Martin, he set a new record of 4 hr 18 min 29.4 sec, from Aldergrove, Northern Ireland, to Gander, Newfoundland, on 31 August 1951. The following year, Beamont had the distinction of being the first pilot to make a double-Atlantic crossing by jet, when on 26 August 1952, flying Canberra B.5 VX185, he again flew from Aldergrove to Gander and then back again to Aldergove, in 10 hours 3 minutes. =Lightning= English Electric Lightning P1.B XA847 during trials in November 1958 The English Electric P.1 was to be the RAF's first Mach 2 interceptor and to achieve that speed it was a radical design with a 60¬∞ wing sweep. To gain relevant experience, Beamont flew the Short SB.5 fitted with the 60¬∞ sweep wing and Hunter II (WB202) (with the AS Sapphire Engines)The P.1A prototypes were fitted with two Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines, instead of the Avon engines of the P.1B in April 1953. He made 23 test flights in the SB.5 up to May 1954. In July, Beamont was put in overall charge of flight test work at Boscombe Down when the P.1 was moved there prior to its first flight. He made a number of short hops in the P.1A during taxi runs between July and August. The first flight had been originally scheduled for 3 August, but Beamont accidentally triggered the engine bay fire extinguishers while reviewing the check lists, causing a delay while the engine bays were cleaned. On 4 August 1954 he made the first flight, which he described this as \\"classic technical success\\", albeit with a complete breakdown in radio communication between the pilots and ATC. One week later during its third flight, WG760 achieved Mach 1 in level flight for the first time. He followed this with a period of development flying in which he explored the envelope of the P1 culminating in a flight to Mach 1.5 in February 1956. The P.1A was limited to Mach 1.5 because of a lack of directional stability due to insufficient fin area. The original Air Ministry specification to which the P.1A had been designed had only called for a speed of Mach 1.5. In 1955 Beamont was appointed flight operations manager. On 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847, fitted with Avon engines) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight. On 25 November he reached Mach 2, the first time in a British aircraft.During the early flight trials of the P1.B speeds in excess of 1000 mph were achieved daily; during this period the Fairey FD2 delta held the world speed record (1132 mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules, see Beamont 1985 page 59 =TSR-2= TSR-2 was conceived as a low-level supersonic interdictor aircraft. By September 1964 the flight test programme was 18 months behind schedule, the undercarriage was complex and unreliable; the engine development (Bristol Olympus Mk.320) had been delayed by a series of catastrophic failures. When the first airframe (XR219) was ready for flight, the cause of the engine failures had not been rectified. On 26 September 1964 a meeting was held at which the airworthiness of the engine was debated. As the test pilot, Beamont was allowed to decide if it should be flown the next day. He stated that \\"...in view of the mounting political pressures on the programme, it might be acceptable to take this level of risk for one flight only. But if we did then ... we do not fly again until we have fully adequately modified engines for the programme\\". Beamont made the first flight from Boscombe Down the next day (27 September 1964). The initial 15 minute test flight was with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly controlled. Despite this, Beamont noted that it was an impressively precise and controllable aeroplane. Over the following three months the engines were modified and the undercarriage cleared for retraction, allowing the second flight to take place on 31 December 1964. Running short of day light, Beamont took off at 2:40 pm. Once airborne he noted poor forward vision, which he initially thought was due to glare from the low sun until he realised that his instrument panel also appeared blurred. Realising this was due to high frequency vibration affecting his eyes he throttled back No. 1 engine, determining the engine speed range over which this vibration was a problem. This problem forced Beamont to land XR219 with asymmetric thrust.The problem was traced to a malfunctioning fuel pump that was out-of-balance. Beamont was unable to retract the undercarriage satisfactorily on the third and fourth flights. On the fifth flight the undercarriage bogies jammed in a vertical orientation. He understood that this could cause a catastrophe on landing and offered the project navigator, Don Bowen, the opportunity to \\"use the Martin-Baker Mk.5 ejection seat\\". Don Bowen declined. Beamont was confident in the XR219's precise flying, so made a long approach at low descent rate (0.12 m/s) and successfully rotated the bogies by using the weight of the aircraft on landing.The tandem-wheel main wheel bogies on the TSR 2 rotated longitudinally 180 degrees around a horizontal pivot point at the bottom of the leg during retraction so that the two-wheel truck was upside down when stowed. The bogies were rotated by electric motors and the problem was traced to incorrect electrical sequencing of the retraction/extension procedure caused by excessive clearances on the actuating microswitches. On the tenth flight Beamont successfully retracted the undercarriage, he cycled it twice and took XR219 out to 500 knots in stages. At that stage in the programme, XR219 had a flight resonance clearance of 500 kts As TSR-2 was designed to follow contours at high speed, Beamont decided to fly it down Boscombe's runway at 100 ft and 450 knots, commenting later that it had \\"beautiful control\\". On Flight 14 (22 February 1965) Beamont returned XR219 to BAC Warton. During the flight, he achieved exceeded Mach 1 for the first time, using dry power only. Following this, Beamont lit a single reheat unit Beamont lit a single reheat unit because of problems with the other engine's reheat fuel pump with the result that the aircraft accelerated away from the chase Lightning. Directorship In 1960 Beamont was appointed a special director of English Electric Aviation. In May 1965 he retired from prototype flying and was appointed as BAC Warton's flight operations director. He did however continue production test flying of Lightnings until 1968 when he retired from test flying altogether, by then he had flown 167 different types during a total of 5,100hr and 8,000 flights, of which more than 1,100 were supersonic. In 1971, he became Panavia flight operations director, responsible for the testing of the Panavia Tornado, retiring in August 1979 following the maiden flight of the first production Tornado. After retirement he devoted himself to writing; contributing to various aeronautical publications and writing number of books about his experiences. He died on 19 November 2001 at the age of 81. In 2002 he was posthumously awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre.WW2Awards: BEAMONT, Roland Prosper 'Bee' Personal life Beamont was a keen dinghy sailor and ornithologist. On 13 October 1942, he married Shirley Dagmar Adams, the WAAF officer he had transported to the dance in his Hurricane and the daughter of the artist Bernard Robert Adams. They had a daughter Carol, born in early 1944.. Shirley died in 1945, two weeks before Roland was liberated from Luckenwalde. On 14 March 1947 he married Patricia Whitehead, the daughter of Richard Galpine Raworth, solicitor. With Patricia he had two daughters and raised her son from her previous marriage.

He served as its president until October 1, 2012. In the 1970s, he was one of the most active leaders within the Libertarian Party. He directed the Party as its National Chair from 1974 to 1977, worked on John Hospers's Presidential bid and managed Ed Clark's 1978 campaign for Governor of California. In 1980, Crane served as Communications Director to the Libertarian Party Presidential ticket of Clark and Vice Presidential candidate David Koch. Prior to founding the Cato Institute, Crane was chartered financial analyst and vice president of Alliance Capital in California. Crane has been a member of the board of various political organizations, including Americans for Limited Government, a group that assists grassroots efforts throughout the country, and the Center for Competitive Politics. Crane is also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society. Tenure at Cato Institute In 1977, with the funding of Charles Koch and the assistance of Murray Rothbard, Crane established the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. While at Cato, Crane grew the organization: from a staff of 10 and a budget of $800,000 when it first opened in San Francisco, to a staff of 127 and a $21 million budget in a newly renovated building in Washington, DC. In 2012, a shareholder dispute arose between Crane and Charles and David Koch. Crane accused the Kochs of trying to take control of the organization. The Kochs contended that the shares of deceased shareholder William Niskanen should have been offered to the Institute first, and not passed to his widow. Crane later said that he spoke to New Yorker journalist Jane Meyer, whose reporting indicated the conflict was also about the ideological direction of the Institute. As part of the dispute settlement, the Cato shareholder agreement was dissolved and Crane agreed to retire. In 2013 Crane launched Purple PAC, a super-PAC that supports candidates and causes consistent with the libertarian philosophy.http://purplepac.org/about/ Political views Crane has been described as, \\"one of the men most responsible for the fall of communism, for the rise of libertarianism as an influential political philosophy and movement, and for unselfishly supporting three generations of scholars devoted to developing and applying the freedom philosophy.\\" Crane is politically libertarian.https://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/pubs/calbusiness/winter2004/alumni4.html To him, the core principles of libertarianism are personal liberty, free markets and limited government.https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/free-radical- libertarian-contrarian-ed-crane-has-run-cato-institute-25-years-way He was supportive of then-presidential candidate Ron Paul on issues such as cutting spending, lowering taxes, support for a non-interventionist foreign policy, protecting civil liberties and promoting Austrian economics. \\"Support for dynamic market capitalism (as opposed to crony capitalism), social tolerance, and a healthy skepticism of foreign military adventurism is a combination of views held by a plurality of Americans,\\" he states in his column. \\"It is why the 21st century is likely to be a libertarian century. It is why the focus should be on Ron Paul's philosophy and his policy proposals in 2012.\\"https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/why-ron-paul-matters In 2016 he supported presidential candidate Rand Paul. It was reported that Crane had stopped raising money for the Purple PAC that was supporting Rand; but Crane stated that the PAC was still operating and it wasn't shutting down.https://reason.com/blog/2015/09/29/politico-overstates-his-dropping-out- ins He stated, \\"I'm still 'standing with Rand,' as they say, and there's no one else I can think of supporting.\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post- politics/wp/2015/09/29/pro-rand-paul-pac-isnt-shutting-down-just-asking-paul- to-be-more-libertarian/ ReferencesExternal links * Cato Institute ‚Äì Edward Crane bio * Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Activists from California Category:American libertarians Category:American political activists Category:California Libertarians Category:Cato Institute people Category:Libertarian National Committee chairs Category:Members of the Libertarian Party (United States) Category:Monetary reformers Category:Non-interventionism ","title":"Ed Crane (libertarian)"},{"id":"1632863","text":"GEOS (Graphic Environment Operating System) is a discontinued operating system from Berkeley Softworks (later GeoWorks). Originally designed for the Commodore 64 with its version being released in 1986, enhanced versions of GEOS later became available in 1987 for the Commodore 128 and in 1988 for the Apple II family of computers. A lesser-known version was also released for the Commodore Plus/4. GEOS closely resembles early versions of the classic Mac OS and includes a graphical word processor (geoWrite) and paint program (geoPaint). A December 1987 survey by the Commodore-dedicated magazine Compute!'s Gazette found that nearly half of respondents used GEOS. For many years, Commodore bundled GEOS with its redesigned and cost-reduced C64, the C64C. At its peak, GEOS was the third-most-popular microcomputer operating system in the world in terms of units shipped, trailing only MS-DOS and Mac OS (besides the original Commodore 64's KERNAL). Other GEOS-compatible software packages were available from Berkeley Softworks or from third parties, including a reasonably sophisticated desktop publishing application called geoPublish and a spreadsheet called geoCalc. While geoPublish is not as sophisticated as Aldus Pagemaker and geoCalc not as sophisticated as Microsoft Excel, the packages provide reasonable functionality, and Berkeley Softworks founder Brian Dougherty claimed the company ran its business using its own software on Commodore 8-bit computers for several years. Development Written by a group of programmers, the GEOS Design Team:GEOS User's Manual, Version 1.2 , Printed: October 1986, Berkeley Softworks, 2150 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California 94704 Jim DeFrisco, Dave Durran, Michael Farr, Doug Fults, Chris Hawley, Clayton Jung, and Tony Requist, led by Dougherty, who cut their teeth on limited-resource video game machines such as the Atari 2600, GEOS was revered for what it could accomplish on machines with 64‚Äì128 kB of RAM memory and 1‚Äì2 MHz of 8-bit processing power. Unlike many pieces of proprietary software for the C64 and C128, GEOS takes full advantage of many of the add-ons and improvements available for these systems. Commodore's 1351 mouse is supported by GEOS, as are its various RAM expansion units. GEOS 128 also fully supports the C128's 640√ó200 high-resolution VDC display mode through a compatible RGB monitor. The C64 version of GEOS incorporates a built-in fast loader, called diskTurbo, that significantly increases the speed of drive access on the slow 1541. GEOS is the first Commodore software that could use a floppy disk as swap space or virtual memory. GEOS 128 can take advantage of the C128's enhanced \\"burst mode\\" in conjunction with the 1571 and 1581 drives. The Commodore version of GEOS uses a copy protection scheme that renders users' disks unbootable if it detects that the disk has been illegally duplicated. Via Berkeley's special geoCable interface converter or other third-party interfaces to connect standard RS-232 or Centronics printers to the Commodore serial bus, GEOS supports a wide variety of printers, including HP PCL printers and the Apple LaserWriter. This ability to print to high-end printers was a major factor in making GEOS a desktop publishing platform. The Apple II version of GEOS was released as freeware in August 2003. The Commodore 64/128 versions followed in February 2004. The latest GEOS desktop suite for IBM PC compatibles is Breadbox Ensemble. Revivals were seen in the OmniGo handhelds, Brother GeoBook line of laptop-appliances, and the NewDeal Office package for PCs. Related code found its way to earlier \\"Zoomer\\" PDAs, creating an unclear lineage to Palm, Inc.'s later work.

Retrieved on 31 March 2007.29 July 2020) was a Zimbabwean air officer and government official who served as Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe from 1 December 2017 until his death on 29 July 2020. He was the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe and member of the Joint Operations Command which exerts day-by-day control over Zimbabwe's government.Air Force of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Ministry of Defence. Retrieved on 31 March 2007. Perrance Shiri was a cousin of former President Robert Mugabe. He called himself \\"Black Jesus\\", because according to an anonymous claim on the BBC Panorama documentary \\"The Price of Silence\\", he \\"could determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or not.\\"\\"The Price of Silence\\", BBC Panorama, 10 March 2002 On 30 November 2017, Shiri was appointed Minister of Agriculture by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. On 18 December he was promoted from Air Marshal to Air Chief Marshal upon retirement. Career Military service = From 1983 to 1984, the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade, under Shiri's command, was responsible for a reign of terror in Matabeleland. During the slaughter, thousands of civilians were killed and thousands more were tortured. Despite this, in 1986, Shiri was granted a place at the Royal College of Defence Studies in London. In 1992, Shiri was appointed as the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, taking over from Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai. Shiri was in command of the Zimbabwean troops at the start of the Second Congo War. It was Shiri who decided that the Zimbabwean contingent would defend N'Djili and its airport. This was in order to maintain an air route for resupply and reinforcements if needed. In the late-1990s and early-2000s, Shiri was reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans. In 2002, in response to the subsequent food shortage, Mugabe dispatched Shiri to South Africa to purchase maize. This undertaking was backed by a credit note for the equivalent of ¬£17 million from the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi. With the Mugabe government facing increasing problems, the Zimbabwean press reported in February 2007 that Shiri was regularly attending General Solomon Mujuru‚Äôs unofficial meetings with other senior military commanders and some political leaders. These meetings had discussed forcing Mugabe to the polls in 2008 with a view to his replacement as president. In 2008 some Zimbabwean lawyers and opposition politicians from Mutare claimed that Shiri managed military assaults on illegal diggers in the diamond mines in the east of Zimbabwe. =2008 election= In the days before the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election Shiri, along with other Zimbabwean Defence chiefs, held a press conference where they stated that defence and security forces had been deployed across the country to maintain order. In a remark aimed against the Movement for Democratic Change, the defence chiefs stated that it would be a criminal act for anyone to declare himself the winner of the election. They maintained that such a statement must only be made by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission. =Sanctions against Shiri= In 2002 the European Union barred then Air Marshal Shiri from entering the EU and on 6 March 2003, George W. Bush ordered the blocking of any of Shiri's property in the United States. =Assassination attempt= Shiri was ambushed on 13 December 2008 while driving to his farm. According to police, he was accosted by unknown people who shot at his car. Thinking one of his tyres had burst, he got out and was shot in the arm.\\"Zimbabwe air force head 'wounded'\\", BBC News It has been speculated that the assassination attempt was a response to Shiri's attacks on illegal diamond miners in 2008 or because of his role in Matabeleland in the 1980s. In October 2013, Shiri's son, Titus Takudzwa Chikerema, died at the age of 21. 2017 coup and ministerial appointment Shiri was influential in orchestrating the 2017 Zimbabwean coup d'√©tat which removed Mugabe from power. On 30 November 2017, Shiri was appointed Minister of Agriculture by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. On 18 December he was promoted from Air Marshal to Air Chief Marshal upon retirement.  Death  Shiri died on 29 July 2020, after being hospitalized the day before. He was 65; local news sources say his death was due to complications from COVID-19. Mnangagwa described Shiri as a ‚Äúlongtime friend and colleague‚Äù and ‚Äúa true patriot.‚Äù Shiri was subsequently succeeded by Anxious Jongwe Masuka as the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, and Rural Resettlement.

Guardians are typically used in four situations: guardianship for an incapacitated senior (due to old age or infirmity), guardianship for a minor, and guardianship for developmentally disabled adults and for adults found to be incompetent.  Guardianship for incapacitated seniors  A guardianship for an incapacitated senior will typically arise where someone determines that a senior has become unable to care for their own person and/or property. In some cases, there may be a belief that the senior is being financially exploited or about to be exploited. In other cases, the person may be unable to care for him or herself and is not able to properly engage in the activities of daily living without assistance. There will typically be a precipitating incident that causes a professional, family member, health care worker or clergyman to initiate guardianship proceedings. In most states, the process will start with a determination whether the alleged incapacitated person is actually incapacitated. There will often be an evidentiary hearing. Only if a finding of incapacity is made will the next step take place: whether a guardian is necessary and to what extent (e.g. a guardian may be needed for the person's finances but not for the person) and, if so, who the guardian should be. The determination of whether a guardianship is necessary may consider a number of factors, including whether there is a lesser restrictive alternative, such as the use of an already existing power of attorney and health care proxy. In some cases, a guardianship dispute can become quite contentious, and can result in litigation between a parent and adult children or between different siblings against each other in what is essentially a pre-probate dispute over a parent's wealth. Stopping the guardianship is often pursued in such cases as well. = Abuses = A report published in 2010 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office looked at 20 selected closed cases in which guardians stole or otherwise improperly obtained assets from clients. In 6 of these 20 cases, the courts failed to adequately screen guardians ahead of time and appointed individuals with criminal convictions or significant financial problems, and in 12 of 20 cases, the courts failed to oversee guardians once they had been appointed.Guardianships: Cases of Financial Exploitation, Neglect, and Abuse of Seniors, Highlights, U.S. Government Accountability Office, Published: Sep 30, 2010. Publicly Released: Oct 27, 2010.Column: With U.S. elder abuse in spotlight, a look at guardians, Reuters, Mark Miller, Oct. 20, 2017. In October 2017, The New Yorker published an article looking at the situation in Nevada in which professional guardians sometimes have a number of clients, and argued toward the conclusion that in a number of cases the courts did not properly oversee these arrangements.HOW THE ELDERLY LOSE THEIR RIGHTS, Guardians can sell the assets and control the lives of senior citizens without their consent‚Äîand reap a profit from it, The New Yorker, Rachel Aviv, Oct. 9, 2017. In 2018 the investigative documentary \\"The Guardians\\" was published, alleging \\"legal kidnapping of elderly people\\" in Nevada by private guardianship businesses with no familiar relations, seeking to economically profit from seniors' savings.  Guardianship for minors Natural guardian= A minor child's parent is the child's natural guardian. =Legal guardian= Most countries and states have laws that provide that the parents of a minor child are the natural guardians of that child, and that the parents may designate who shall become the child's legal guardian in the event of death, typically subject to the approval of the court. Where a minor child's parents are disabled or deceased, it may be necessary for a court to appoint a guardian.  Guardianship for developmentally disabled adults  Legal guardians may be appointed in guardianship cases for adults (see also conservatorship). For example, parents may start a guardianship action to become the guardians of a developmentally-disabled child when the child reaches the age of majority.  Rules applicable to all guardians  Courts generally have the power to appoint a guardian for an individual in need of special protection. A guardian with responsibility for both the personal well- being and the financial interests of the ward is a general guardian. A person may also be appointed as a special guardian, having limited powers over the interests of the ward. A special guardian may, for example, be given the legal right to determine the disposition of the ward's property without being given any authority over the ward's person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a legal guardian may be called a \\"conservator\\", \\"custodian\\", or curator. Many jurisdictions and the Uniform Probate Code distinguish between a \\"guardian\\" or \\"guardian of the person\\" who is an individual with authority over and fiduciary responsibilities for the physical person of the ward, and a \\"conservator\\" or \\"guardian of the property\\" of a ward who has authority over and fiduciary responsibilities for significant property (often an inheritance or personal injury settlement) belonging to the ward. Some jurisdictions provide for public guardianship programs serving incapacitated adults or children. A guardian is a fiduciary and is held to a very high standard of care in exercising their powers. If the ward owns substantial property the guardian may be required to give a surety bond to protect the ward in the event that dishonesty or incompetence on their part causes financial loss to the ward. Guardian ad litemUnited StatesFamily law and dependency courts= Guardians ad litem (GALs) are not the same as \\"legal guardians\\" and are often appointed in under-age-children cases, many times to represent the interests of the minor children. Guardians ad litem may be called, in some U.S. states, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). In New York State, they are known as Attorneys for the Child (AFCs). They are the voice of the child and may represent the child in court, with many judges adhering to any recommendation given by a GAL. GALs may assist where a child is removed from a hostile environment and custody given to the relevant state or county family services agency, and in those cases assists in the protection of the minor child. Qualifications vary by state, ranging from no experience or qualification, volunteers to social workers to attorneys to others. The GAL's only job is to represent the minor children's best interest and advise the court. A guardian ad litem is an officer of the court, does not represent the parties in the suit, and often enjoys quasi-judicial immunity from any action from the parties involved in a particular case. Training, qualifications and supervision vary from state-to-state, which means that their quality is similarly variable. In, for instance, North Carolina, an applicant (volunteer) must go through a background check and complete 30 hours of training. Although a guardian ad litem working through a CASA program volunteers their services, some guardians ad litem are paid for their services. They must submit detailed time and expense reports to the court for approval. Their fees are taxed as costs in the case. Courts may order all parties to share in the cost, or the court may order a particular party to pay the fees. Volunteer Guardians ad Litem and those that volunteer though a CASA Program need to make sure that they do not engage in the unauthorized practice of law. Therefore, when they appear in court (even if they are an attorney) as a volunteer GAL, it is best practice to be represented by an attorney and have attorneys file motions on their behalf. Guardians ad litem are also appointed in cases where there has been an allegation of child abuse, child neglect, PINS, juvenile delinquency, or dependency. In these situations, the guardian ad litem is charged to represent the best interests of the minor child, which can differ from the position of the state or government agency as well as the interest of the parent or guardian. These guardians ad litem vary by jurisdiction and can be volunteer advocates or attorneys. For example, in North Carolina, trained GAL volunteers are paired with attorney advocates to advocate for the best interest of abused and neglected children. The program defines a child's best interest as a safe, permanent home. =Mental health and probate courts= Guardians ad litem can be appointed by the court to represent the interests of mentally ill or disabled persons. For example, the Code of Virginia requires that the court appoint a \\"discreet and competent attorney-at-law\\" or \\"some other discreet and proper person\\" to serve as guardian ad litem to protect the interests of a person under a disability. Estates and financial decision making Guardians ad litem are sometimes appointed in probate matters to represent the interests of unknown or unlocated heirs to an estate. Settlement guardians ad litem When a settlement is reached in personal injury or medical malpractice case involving claims brought on behalf of a minor or incapacitated plaintiff, courts normally appoint a guardian ad litem to review the terms of the settlement and ensure it is fair and in the best interests of the claimant. The settlement guardian ad litem thoroughly investigates the case, to determine whether the settlement amount is fair and reasonable.  Situation in other countries  England and Wales = Guardians ad litem are employed by Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), a non-departmental public body, to represent the interests of children in cases where the child's wishes differ from those of either parent, known as a Section 16.4 case. The posts are filled by senior social workers with experience in family law proceedings. In 2006, a legal status of \\"special guardianship\\" was introduced (using powers delegated by the Adoption and Children Act 2002) to allow for a child to be cared for by a person with rights similar to a traditional legal guardian, but without absolute legal separation from the child's birth parents. These are not to be confused with court-appointed special guardians in other jurisdictions. = Germany = The German guardianship law with regard to adults was completely changed in 1990. Guardianship (Vormundschaft) of an adult was renamed 'curatorship' (Betreuung), although it remains Vormundschaft for minors. When a person of full age who, as a result of mental disease or physical, mental or psychological handicap is incapable of managing his own affairs, a guardian (Betreuer) can be appointed (section 1896, German Civil Code). An adult guardian is responsible for personal and estate matters, as well as for medical treatment. However, the ward has normally full capacity with all human rights such as those to marry, vote or make a will. The ward's legal capacity can be lost as a result of a court judgment or order (section 1903, German Civ. C.; Einwilligungsvorbehalt). Every guardian has to report annually to the guardianship court (Betreuungsgericht). Professional guardians (Berufsbetreuer) normally hold university degrees in law or social work. = Israel = In Israel, over 50,000 adults have had legal guardians appointed for them; 85% of them have family members as their guardians, and 15% have professional guardians. Until 2014, guardians were supervised by the Office of the Administrator General at the Ministry of Justice in matters of property only. However, changes in Israel and other countries along with public pressure, appeals to the courts by social organizations, academic studies and the State Comptroller's 2004 report led to the decision to broaden the scope of supervision to include personal matters as well, to ensure that the guardians take care of all areas of life, including medical care, personal care, suitable housing, work and employment, social and recreational activities, etc., taking account of the person's wishes and acting accordingly. The Office of the Administrator General (public guardian) at the Ministry of Justice is now implementing a system to supervise guardians in regard to personal matters in order to help identify situations in which guardians are not performing their duties adequately.Dr. Shirli Resnizky, Ittay Mannheim, Ellen Milshtein, Jenny Brodsky, Dori Rivkin, Hana Goldenberg,Chaya Rozenfeld. Pilot for Supervision of Legal Guardians for Personal Affairs: Summary Report. Jerusalem: Myers-JDC-Brookdale Institute (2019). = Republic of Ireland = The court-appointed guardian system in the Republic of Ireland was brought into law on the proposal of the noted gay activist and member of Seanad √âireann (the Irish Senate), David Norris. The Children Acts Advisory Board which was set up to advise the ministers of the government on policy development under the Child Care Act 1991 was then abolished in September 2011. Judges are responsible for appointing child guardians and can choose guardians from Barnardo's a children's charitable service or from among the self-employed guardians, who are mostly former social workers who have gone into private business since the legislation. = Saudi Arabia = All women in Saudi Arabia are required to have a male guardian (Wali) to give permission for various government and economic transactions, as well as some personal life and health decisions. = Sweden = Swedish parental law (the Parental Code) regulates legal guardianship for both children and disabled adults. Legal guardianship for unaccompanied minors is regulated by a law of its own. Except for normal parenthood, the guardianship is assigned by the district court and supervised by the Chief Guardian, a municipal authority that is mandatory in every Swedish municipality. What is included in the field of guardianship is decided by the district court. The responsibility for health care and nursing is never included in the guardianship for adults, but is always so for minors. The guardianship for adults can take two legal forms, \\"conservator\\" or \\"administrator\\". The main difference between these two is that an \\"administrator\\" has the sole permission to take legal actions within the field of the guardianship. A guardianship can have different legal forms for different parts of the guardianship. Such things as basic human rights is never denied the ward by this law, but some of them can be denied by other laws. A conservator is normally assigned with the approval of the ward. But if the physical conditions of the ward does not permit him to give such approval, a conservator can be assigned anyhow. Everything a conservator does for his ward have to be approved by him, or can be assumed to be approved by him. For more complex situations, like taking loans or selling of a house, he or she needs approval from the local authorities. Once a year a legally assigned guardian have to send his accounting to the Chief Guardian for review. Since the year 2017, the ward can, while she still have her mental abilities, write a special future letter of attorney (Framtidsfullmakt) which later can be used when she loses her abilities. How such a letter should be written is described in detail in the paternal law, and normally follows the principles of a will. This law was created since it in Sweden is unclear if a normal letter of attorney is valid after the ward has lost her abilities.

Early life and career Prior to assuming the role of Imam, Ghalib served as the Qadi (judge) of Rustaq and Nizwa.Calvin H. Allen Jr: Oman: the Modernization of the Sultanate. He later served as the Treasurer of the Imamate. After the predecessor, Imam Alkhalili, died on 3 May 1954, Ghalib Alhinai was elected to be the Imam (ruler). His father, Ali bin Hilal Alhinai, previously served as the Wali (governor) of Rustaq.: File 8/62 III Principal Shaikhs & Tribes of Oman.. His brother Talib bin Ali would become an effective and determined leader in the Imamate's revolt against the Sultan of Muscat in the 1950s. History Oman was split between the interior, which was known as the Imamate of Oman, and the coastal Oman, known as the Sultanate of Muscat. The British government exercised vast control over the Sultanate as the defence secretary and chief of intelligence, chief adviser to the sultan and all ministers except for one were British. The Guardian: Britain‚Äôs secret warsBritish National Archive: Muscat and Oman Internal Affairs History Shortly after Imam Ghalib was elected in 1954, he led the Imamate of Oman in the Jebel Akhdar War against sultan Said Bin Taimur, backed by the British government. In 1937, an agreement between the sultan and a subsidiary of Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), a consortium of oil companies that is largely British owned, was signed to grant oil concessions to IPC, in which the sultan received a sizable signature bonus. IPC informed the sultan that potential oil may exist in the interior of Oman and offered financial support to raise an armed force against any potential resistance by the Imamate. The British government favoured IPC's plan as it sought benefits from the expansion of the Sultanate's territory and considered oil discovery in Oman as a valuable insurance against the insecurity of other parts of the Middle East. The planning of occupying the interior started early in 1945 as news broke out that Imam Alkhalili, the predecessor to Imam Alhinai, was ill and the sultan expressed his interest to the British government of occupying the interior right after the death of the Imam.A.C.Gallowey: File 8/62 Muscat State Affairs: Principal Shaikhs and Tribes of Oman' 35r (69/296). The idea of having the oil company negotiate directly with the interior of Oman was not favored by the British Political Agent who resided in Muscat providing the justification that it would mean recognizing the authority of the Imamate and it would increase its prestige. The British Political Agent believed that the only method of granting the oil company access to the interior was by assisting the sultan in occupying the Imamate.British Consulate Muscat: File 8/62 Muscat State Affairs: Principal Shaikhs and Tribes of Oman. The position of the British government was thereafter to eliminate any possibility of entering into direct relations with the interior in order not to alienate the sultan and to avoid invalidating the claim of IPC that its concession from the sultan covers the entirety of Oman.Britannic Majesty's Government: Historical Summary of Events in the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, 1928‚Äì1953 97r (198/222). In 1946, the British government offered arms and ammunition, auxiliary supplies and officers to occupy the interior. In September 1946, the British government studied the proposal that was promised to the sultan of using the British Royal Air Force (RAF) to occupy the interior. The British government concluded that it is reluctant \\"in principle\\" to the use of force for the reason of avoiding international criticism that may lead to the calling of the British government before the United Nations Security Council. Meanwhile, the British government recognized that the use of RAF would expedite oil exploration operations in the interior of Oman. The Foreign Office London: File 8/62 Muscat State Affairs: Principal Shaikhs and Tribes of Oman 146r (291/296).India Office London : File 8/62 Muscat State Affairs: Principal Shaikhs and Tribes of Oman 89r (177/296). The war was triggered by the sultan, Said Bin Taimur, on 25 October 1954, when he licensed IPC oil prospectors to search for oil near Fahud, an area located within the territory of the Imamate of Oman and sent Muscat and Oman Field Force (MOFF), later renamed Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces (SAF), troops to occupy it. The MOFF moved to occupy Tanam on the following day. The move was considered by the Imam to be a breach to the Treaty of Seeb, an agreement which recognized the autonomy of the Imamate. The occupation of Fahud and Tanam was only a prelude to a grand design by the Sultanate to occupy the entire Imamate. On 13 December 1954, the MOFF, which was instilled with eight British officers, marched from Fahud to Adam and occupied it. Subsequently, the capital of the Imamate, Nizwa, was captured by the Sultanate on 15 December 1955. However, resistance from the Imamate forces persisted and Talib Alhinai, who was the Wali (governor) of Rustaq and the younger brother of the Imam, played a key role in strengthening the Imamate's forces by recruiting additional forces and acquiring Saudi, Egypt and Iraq's support.Europa Publications: A Political Chronology of the Middle East (2001)Gregory Fremont Barnes: A History of Counterinsurgency The restrengthening of the Imamate's forces materialized when a number of the interior villages were recaptured, including Bilad Sayt, on 14 June 1957. The MOFF moved an artillery battery to Bilad Sayt in anticipation of an easy victory. However, the Imamate's forces proved to be much better organized than anticipated. After weeks of skirmishes, the MOFF, with no civilian support from the locals in the interior, had no choice but to surrender their way back to Fahud. The Imamate's forces freed Nizwa (capital), Firq, Izki, Tanuf, Bahla and Jebal Akhdar from the Sultunate's control, while Ibri was the only area that remained under the occupation of the Sultunate. On 25 July 1958, as a result of the ongoing war and British government's aim to be \\"less visible\\" in the Middle East in the post-Suez world, letters were exchanged between the sultan and the British leaders and subsequently an assistance in economic development agreement was signed, which consisted of strengthening the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces (SAF) by attaching British officers to lead small units and to head the SAF as a whole. The war lasted 5 years until the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces, with much difficulty and following direct support of soldiers from the British Special Air Service, 1st Battalion of the Cameronions, a troop of the 15/19 Hussars, RAF fighter jets and a squadron of Ferret armoured cars,Robert Johnson : At the End of Military Intervention. put down the Jebel Akhdar War in 1959,John B.

He continued for a short time to lead a temporary government-in-exile from Dammam (Saudi Arabia) and established an Imamate Office in Cairo (Egypt) while the fighting continued in Oman.Majid Alkhalili: Oman's Foreign Policy. Imam Ghalib delegated his brother, Talib Alhinai, who was the Wali (governor) of Rustaq, and Suleiman bin Hamyar, who was the Wali (governor) of Jebel Akhdar, to present the issue to the Arab League and the United Nations in order to seek recognition and claim legitimacy of the Imamate of Oman.CNN Arabic: ŸàŸÅÿßÿ© ÿ¢ÿÆÿ± ÿ£ÿ¶ŸÖÿ© ÿπŸèŸÖÿßŸÜ ŸÅŸä ŸÖŸÜŸÅÿßŸá ÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿßÿ≥Ÿä ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπŸàÿØŸäÿ© The Imamate's cause was closely identified with Arab nationalism and the various forms of anti-colonialism that were taking place during that period. In August 1959, the UN Security Council voted by a narrow margin not to consider a request for an urgent meeting to discuss 'British aggression against' an independent Imamate of Oman. The UN General Assembly adopted the 'Question of Oman' resolution in 1965, 1966 and again in 1967 that called upon the British government to cease all actions against the locals, end British control over Oman and reaffirmed the inalienable right of the Omani people to self- determination and independence.United Nations: 2302 Question of Oman.United Nations: 22nd Session Adopted Resolutions. United Nations: 20th Session Adopted Resolutions.United Nations: 2073 Question of Oman. The 'question of Oman' remained on the UN General Assembly agenda in each year until 1971. The Imamate's cause continued to be promoted up until 1970. He continued to receive many visitors from Oman up until his death and was deeply respected by the people of Oman.

The British Overseas Territories are not included. Based on agreements that are not legally binding, the internal borders of the CTA are subject to minimal controls, if any, and can normally be crossed by British and Irish citizens with minimal identity documents with certain exceptions. The maintenance of the CTA involves co-operation on immigration matters between the British and Irish authorities. In 2014, the British and Irish governments began a trial system of mutual recognition of each other's visas for onward travel within the CTA. As of June 2016, it applies to Chinese and Indian nationals and is limited to certain visa types. Other nationalities and those holding non- qualifying visas still require separate visas to visit both countries and may not avail of a transit visa exception if wishing to transit through the UK to Ireland. Since 1997, the Irish government has imposed systematic identity checks on air passengers coming from the UK and selective checks on sea passengers, and occasional checks on land crossings. History1923 agreement= The Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922 at a time when systematic passport and immigration controls were becoming standard at international frontiers. Although the British had imposed entry controls in the pastnotably during the French RevolutionMark v. Mark, decision of the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, [2005] UKHL 42 at para 17.the imposition of such controls in the 20th century dated from the Aliens Act 1905, before which there was a system of registration for arriving foreigners. Before the creation of the Irish Free State, British immigration law applied in Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. With the imminent prospect of Irish independence in 1922, the British Home Office was disinclined to impose passport and immigration controls between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, which would have meant patrolling a porous and meandering longOrdnance Survey of Northern Ireland, 1999MFPP Working Paper No. 2, \\"The Creation and Consolidation of the Irish Border\\" by KJ Rankin and published in association with Institute for British-Irish Studies, University College Dublin and Institute for Governance, Queen's University, Belfast (also printed as IBIS working paper no. 48) land border. If, however, the pre-1922 situation were to be continued, the Irish immigration authorities would have to continue to enforce British immigration policy after independence. The Irish Department for Home Affairs was found to be receptive to continuing with the status quo and an informal agreement to this effect was reached in February 1923: each side would enforce the other's immigration decisions and the Irish authorities would be provided with a copy of Britain's suspect-codex (or 'Black Book') of any personae non gratae in the United Kingdom.See Ryan, page 857. The agreement was also, albeit indirectly, referred to in a D√°il debate on 4 June 1925 (D√°il Debates volume 12 columns 317‚Äì318). The agreement was provided for in UK law by deeming the Irish Free State to be part of the United Kingdom for the purposes of immigration law.Aliens Order 1923 (UK). It was fully implemented in 1925 when legislation passed in both countries provided for the recognition of the other's landing conditions for foreigners.Respectively by the Aliens Order 1925 (Ireland) and the Aliens Order 1925 (UK). This may be considered to have been the high point of the CTAalthough it was not called that at the timeas it almost amounted to a common immigration area. A foreigner who had been admitted to one state could, unless his or her admission had been conditional upon not entering the other state, travel to the other with only minimal bureaucratic requirements. The CTA was suspended on the outbreak of war in 1939, and travel restrictions were introduced between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.See #References and further reading: Ryan. This meant that travel restrictions even applied to people travelling within the UK if they were travelling from Northern Ireland to elsewhere in the UK. =1952 agreement= After the war, the Irish re-instated their previous provisions allowing free movementby the Aliens Order 1946 (Ireland) . but the British declined to do so pending the agreement of a \\"similar immigration policy\\"Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, Geoffrey de Freitas, House of Commons Debates volume 478 columns 842‚Äì849 (28 July 1950). in both countries.

The CTA has meant that Ireland has been required to follow changes in British immigration policy.#References and further reading: Ryan at p865. This was notable in 1962 when Irish law was changed in response to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which imposed immigration controls between the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, while in Ireland the Aliens Order 1962 replaced the state's previous provision exempting all British subjects from immigration control, with one exempting only those born in the United Kingdom. The scope of the Irish provision was much more restrictive than the British legislation as it excluded from immigration control only those British citizens born in the United Kingdom, and imposed immigration controls on those born outside the UK. The latter group would have included individuals who were British citizens by descent or by birth in a British colony. This discrepancy between Britain's and Ireland's definition of a British citizen was not resolved until 1999.by the Aliens (Exemption) Order 1999 (Ireland), which exempted all (and only) British citizens from immigration control. =2008 proposal= In July 2008, the UK Border Agency (the predecessor of UK Visas and Immigration) published a consultation paper on the CTA that envisaged the imposition of immigration controls for non-CTA nationals, and new measures for identity checks of CTA nationals, as well as an advance passenger information system, on all air and sea crossings between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. While passport controls were proposed to be applied to travellers between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, the nature of possible identity controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland was not clear. This led to controversy because Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, with a prominent Unionist describing the proposed arrangements as \\"intolerable and preposterous\\". The nature of identity checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain was characterised by the British government as follows: As far as the land border is concerned, the proposal indicated that the border would be \\"lightly controlled\\" and a joint statement in 2008 by both governments confirmed that there are no plans for fixed controls on either side of the border. On 1 April 2009, an amendment moved by Lord Glentoran in the House of Lords defeated the British Government's proposal and preserved the CTA. The relevant clause was re-introduced by Home Office minister Phil Woolas in the Public Bill Committee in June, but again removed in July after opposition pressure. =2011 memorandum of understanding = 2011 marked the first public agreement between the British and Irish governments concerning the maintenance of the CTA.

This withdrawal from the EU makes the Republic of Ireland‚ÄìUnited Kingdom border on the island of Ireland an external border of the European Union. However, the Irish and UK governments and the President of the European Council have stated that they do not wish for a hard border in Ireland, taking into account the historical and social \\"sensitivities\\" that permeate the island. In September 2016 the British Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, stated that the UK government would not seek a return to a \\"hard border\\" between the UK and Republic of Ireland. In October 2016, the UK and Irish governments considered in outline a plan entailing British immigration controls being applied at Irish ports and airports after Brexit, so that Britain might control migration by EU citizens (other than Irish nationals) across the open border into the United Kingdom. This would avoid passport checks being required between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland (ie. the UK). However, this agreement was never finalised and was met by opposition from political parties in the Republic of Ireland. On 23 March 2017, it was confirmed that British immigration officials would not be allowed to use Irish ports and airports. In June 2017, the UK government's policy paper on the position of EU citizens in the UK stated a desire to \\"protect the Common Travel Area arrangements\\", stating that \\"Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for 'settled status' to protect their entitlements\\". =2019 memorandum of understanding = On 8 May 2019, Simon Coveney and UK Cabinet Office minister David Lidington signed a memorandum of understanding in an effort to secure the rights of Irish and British citizens post-Brexit. The document was signed in London before a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, putting the rights of both countries' citizens, that are already in place under the Common Travel Area, on a more secure footing. Paragraph 17 of the memorandum of understanding states: ‚ÄúThe foregoing record represents the common understanding of the Participants upon the matters referred to therein. It is not of itself intended to create legally binding obligations. The longstanding durability of the CTA has benefited from a degree of flexibility and the detail of the foregoing arrangements may continue to evolve.‚Äù The agreement, which is the culmination of over two years' work of both governments, means the rights of both countries' citizens are protected after Brexit while also ensuring that Ireland will continue to meet its obligations under EU law. The agreement took effect on 31 January 2020 when the United Kingdom actually left the European Union. =UK immigration system from 2021= On 5 March 2020, the British government introduced the Immigration Bill which will end free movement of EU citizens from 1 January 2021, but makes exceptions for Irish citizens. The bill proposes to amend the Immigration Act 1971 by adding \\"An Irish citizen does not require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom\\".Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, part 1, section 2 Guidance from the government also states: \\"Irish citizens will continue to be able to enter and live in the UK as they do now\\". Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to both the British and Irish governments implementing a series of measures regarding entry into each other‚Äôs jurisdictions. From early June 2020, anyone planning on entering the UK must fill in a form providing their journey and contact details before they travel to the UK, and some must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. However, the British government have provided an exemption to people arriving in the UK from the Common Travel Area: they do not need to complete the form or self-isolate if they have spent the last 14 days or more in Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. From late July, anyone planning on entering Ireland must fill in a Passenger Locator Form, and some must self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival (this includes Irish citizens and residents). There are exemptions for transport workers and passengers travelling from Northern Ireland, and people travelling onward to Northern Ireland need only complete part of the form. Currently the British Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office advises British nationals against all but essential international travel; however, from 4 July 2020 Ireland is exempt from this advice. Currently the Irish government advises Irish citizens against non-essential travel overseas (including to Great Britain but not Northern Ireland) other than to countries on a 'green list'. However, due a sharp increase in cases on both sides, on 25 September the Chief Medical Officers of Ireland and Northern Ireland recommended avoiding all but necessary travel across the border. Effective 10 July 2020, the Irish government temporarily suspended the Short Stay Visa Waiver Programme. Holders from 17 countries with a valid UK short stay visa can no longer visit Ireland for less than 90 days without an Irish visa. Identity and immigration checksChannel Islands= Immigration checks are carried out by the Guernsey Border Agency and the Jersey Customs and Immigration Service on passengers arriving in the Channel Islands only from outside the CTA. =Ireland= alt= In 1997, Ireland changed its immigration legislation to allow immigration officers to examine (i.e. request identity documents from) travellers arriving in the state by sea or air (from elsewhere in the CTA) and to refuse them permission to land if they are not entitled to enter. Although formally this applies only to people other than Irish and British citizens, both of the latter groups are effectively covered as they may be required to produce identity documents to prove that they are entitled to the CTA arrangements. while targeted controls are conducted along the land border in what are referred to as \\"intelligence driven operations\\". Air passengers arriving at Irish ports/airports from elsewhere in the CTA are no longer channelled separately from those arriving from outside the CTA; consequently all sea and air passengers must pass through Irish immigration checks, administered by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). While British citizens are not required to be in possession of a valid travel document as a condition of entry, they may be required to satisfy immigration officials as to their nationality. The nature of the Irish controls was described by an Irish High Court judge, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan, in the following terms: In 2012, a pilot project was set up to use civilian staff from the Immigration section of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) to work with GNIB staff at immigration control at Dublin Airport. INIS staff will be responsible for performing all \\"in-booth\\" duties (including examining arriving passengers), but will not take part in any matters related to restraint, detention or arrest. Transit without visa for Irish biometric visa holders UK visa requirements published in July 2019 allow certain travellers to transit without visa \\"landside\\" (i.e. those who need or wish to pass through the UK border and enter the UK). They must arrive and depart by air; and have a confirmed onward flight that departs before 23:59 hrs the following day; and hold the correct documents for their destination (e.g. a visa for that country if required). Nationals of all countries need a visa to transit landside unless they hold a valid Irish biometric visa, endorsed BC or BC BIVS, and are travelling to the Republic of Ireland. Therefore a holder of a biometric Irish visa does not require a separate UK visa if transiting landside through the UK border on their way to Ireland. =Isle of Man= The Isle of Man government reports that \\"on-entry Immigration Control is rarely undertaken in the Isle of Man as there are very few transport services entering the Isle of Man from outside the CTA.\\" As of April 2018 the only regular commercial air service between the Isle of Man and an airport outside the Common Travel Area is Geneva in Switzerland. The Isle of Man is considered a part of the UK for customs purposes, and so there are no routine customs checks on travellers arriving from the UK. =United Kingdom= The UK Border Force does not carry out routine immigration checks on travellers (regardless of nationality) arriving in the UK from another part of the CTA. However, because the Channel Islands have VAT free status, the UK Border Force carries out selective customs checks on travellers arriving from there. Travel within the UK There are no border controls between the four constituent nations of the UK, and consequently the land frontiers between England, Scotland and Wales are completely open. However, section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 provided for temporary powers to examine persons travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides for similar powers and remains in force. According to the Home Office, with regard to the legal basis for identity screening and immigration checks at airports and sea ports, as carried out on passengers travelling between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, \\"Immigration Enforcement officers may arrest without warrant anyone they have reasonable grounds to suspect has committed an immigration offence and/or may be liable for removal directions.\\" Section 31.19.3 of the Enforcement Instructions and Guidance (part of the visas and immigration operational guidance), relating to the case law Baljinder Singh v. Hammond, said \\"Any questioning must be consensual. The paragraph 2 power to examine does not include a power to compel someone to stop or to require someone to comply with that examination. Should a person seek to exercise their right not to answer questions and leave, there is no power to arrest that person purely on suspicion of committing an immigration offence.\\" As in most countries, airlines may require photo identification (e.g. a passport or a driving licence) for internal flights between destinations within the UK. Common visa system In October 2014, the British and Irish governments signed a memorandum of understanding paving the way for mutually recognised visas allowing visitors to travel to Britain and Ireland on a single visa. Chinese and Indian nationals were the first and, as of 2018, the only nationalities to get the benefit of the scheme. It was proposed to conduct a review of the scheme in 2015 with a view to expand it to all other countries by the end of that year, but no such review took place, and the scheme has not been extended to other nationalities. The scheme exists in parallel to the Irish visa waiver programme which waives the visa requirement for the nationals of 17 countries if they hold valid UK short-stay visas and enter Ireland directly from the UK. While the CTA has, for most of its history, involved an open or relatively open border, since the Second World War this has not meant that someone who legally entered one part of the CTA was automatically entitled to enter another part. Unlike the Schengen Agreement, the CTA currently provides no mechanism for the mutual recognition of leave to enter and remain, and the UK and Ireland operate separate visa systems with distinct entry requirements. In general, a UK visa will not allow entry to Ireland nor vice versa. The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man allow entry to holders of UK visas (with some exceptions). Bailiwick of Guernsey and Jersey immigration authorities routinely check non-EEA nationals seeking to enter the UK to ensure they have valid UK permissions. In July 2011 Ireland introduced a limited pilot visa waiver programme under which the normal requirement for certain nationalities to hold an Irish visa is waived for visitors to the UK who hold valid UK visas. Nationalities that are visa-free in the UK but not in Ireland:   * Nationalities that are visa-free in Ireland but not in the UK:   Irish visa-waiver nationalities       Freedom of movement British and Irish citizens enjoyed the right to live in each other's countries under European Union law, but even after Brexit the provisions that apply to them are generally more far reaching than those that apply to other European Economic Area nationals. , entry to the Common Travel Area by citizens of third countries is controlled by British or by Irish immigration officers according to the point of entry: arrangements after the UK leaves the post-Brexit transition period are yet to be determined. =British citizens in Ireland= Under Irish law, all British citizensincluding Manx people and Channel Islanders, who were not entitled to take advantage of the European Union's freedom of movement provisionsare exempt from immigration control and immune from deportation.Per the provisions of the S.I. No. 97/1999 ‚Äî Aliens (Exemption) Order, 1999 and Immigration Act 1999. They are entitled to live in Ireland without any restrictions or conditions. They have, with limited exceptions,The only exception being that between 1962 and 1999 those British citizens born outside the United Kingdom were not exempt. See the 1952 agreement never been treated as foreigners under Irish law, having never been subject to the Aliens Act 1935 or to any orders made under that Act. British citizens can thus move to Ireland to live, work or retire and unlike other EU citizens, they are not required to demonstrate having sufficient resources or have private health insurance in order to retire. This is due to the fact that British citizens are also entitled to use Irish public services on the same basis as Irish citizens in Ireland. =Irish citizens in the United Kingdom= Before 1949, all Irish citizens were considered under British law to be British subjects.\\"All the people in Ireland are British subjects, and Ireland under the Constitution is under Dominion Home Rule, and has precisely the same powers as the Dominion of Canada, and can legislate, I understand, on matters affecting rights and treaties.\\" Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies, William Ormsby-Gore, House of Common Debates volume 167 column 24 (23 July 1923) After Ireland declared itself a republic in that year, a consequent British law gave Irish citizens a similar status to Commonwealth citizens in the United Kingdom, notwithstanding that they had ceased to be such. Thus, much like British citizens in Ireland, Irish citizens in the United Kingdom have never been treated as foreigners. Irish citizens have, however, like Commonwealth citizens, been subject to immigration control in Britain since the enactment of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. Unlike Commonwealth citizens, Irish citizens have generally not been subject to entry control in the United Kingdom and, if they move to the UK, are considered to have 'settled status' (a status that goes beyond indefinite leave to remain). They may be subject to deportation from the UK upon the same basis as other European Economic Area nationals.See Evans. In February 2007, the British government announced that a specially lenient procedure would apply to the deportation of Irish citizens compared to the procedure for other European Economic Area nationals.Minister of State for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, Liam Byrne, House of Lords Debates volume 689 Column WS54 (19 February 2007) . (Hansard) As a result, Irish nationals are not routinely considered for deportation from the UK when they are released from prison.Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Jeremy Wright, House of Commons Debates Column 293W (5 February 2014) (Hansard). The Government‚Äôs approach to the deportation of Irish citizens since 2007 is to only deport Irish citizens where recommended by a court in sentencing or in exceptional circumstances where that deportation is in the public interest. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/870578/HCB104-explanatory- notes-immigration-Bill-2020.pdf =Other European Economic Area nationals= Nationals of member states of the European Economic Area other than British and Irish nationals have the right to freely enter and reside in Ireland under European Union law (and had the same right in the UK while the latter was a member of the EU). They are required to carry a valid travel document, a passport or a national identity card, for entering the CTA and for travelling between Ireland and the UK.Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Home Office, Mike O'Brien, House of Commons Debates volume 332 column 434‚Äì435 (11 June 1999) ; D. Wallace, Seanad Debates volume 154 columns 106 (4 February 1998) . Citizens' rightsWorking = British or Irish citizens can work in either country, including on a self-employed basis, without needing any permission from the authorities. In support of this, the UK Government is committed to ensuring that, after the UK leaves the EU, appropriate and comprehensive provisions continue to be in place for the recognition of professional qualifications obtained in Ireland. The Irish Government has also committed to working to ensure the provision of arrangements with the UK to recognise professional qualifications. =Education = British and Irish citizens have the right to access all levels of education in either state on terms no less favourable than those available to the citizens of that state. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this continues after the UK leaves the EU. Both Governments have also committed to taking steps to ensure that British and Irish citizens pursuing further and higher education in the other state will continue to have the right to qualify for student loans and support under applicable schemes and eligibility conditions. =Social security benefits = British or Irish citizens residing or working in the other‚Äôs state, working in both states or working across the border are subject to only one state‚Äôs social security legislation at a time. They can access social security benefits and entitlements, including pensions, from whichever state they are subject to the social security legislation of, regardless of where they are living. When working in the CTA, workers pay into the social security scheme of the state where the employer is 'based for tax purposes' (Multinational corporations may have such a base in each state). They are entitled, when in the other state, to the same social security rights, and are subject to the same obligations, as citizens of that state. Workers also have the right to access social security benefits on the same basis as citizens of the state where they are employed. The UK and Irish Governments have concluded a bilateral agreement to ensure that these rights will continue to be protected after the UK leaves the EU. =Healthcare = British and Irish citizens have the right to access healthcare in either state. When visiting they also have the right to access needs-arising health care during their stay. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this will continue after the UK leaves the EU. =Social housing support = British or Irish citizens residing in the other state have the right to access social housing, including supported housing and homeless assistance, on the same basis as citizens of that state. Both Governments have committed to taking steps to ensure that this will continue after the UK leaves the EU. =Voting rights = British or Irish citizens living in the other state are entitled to register to vote with the relevant authorities for local and national parliamentary elections in that state on the same basis as citizens of that state. Upon reaching voting age, they are entitled to vote in those elections on the same basis as citizens of that state. Both Governments have committed to ensuring that these arrangements will continue after the UK leaves the EU. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v1.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Schengen Area In 1985, five member states of the then European Economic Community signed the Schengen Agreement on the gradual phasing out of border controls between them. This treaty and the implementation convention of 1990 paved the way for the creation of the Schengen Area which was implemented in 1995, and by 1997 all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the agreement. The Amsterdam Treaty, drafted that year, incorporated Schengen into EU law while giving Ireland and the UK an opt-out permitting them to maintain systematic passport and immigration controls at their frontiers. The wording of the treaty makes Ireland's opt-out from eliminating border controls conditional on the Common Travel Area being maintained. An important reason for the Schengen Agreement was to make daily cross-border commuting by workers easier as a part of free movement for workers. The United Kingdom and Ireland have a short land border, which is only to part of the UK, making this reason less important to them. The British government has always refused to lower its border controls as it believes that the island status of the CTA puts the UK in a better position to enforce immigration controls than mainland European countries with \\"extensive and permeable land borders\\".Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, House of Commons Debates volume 287 columns 433‚Äì434 (12 December 1996) . While not signing the Schengen Treaty, Ireland has always looked more favourably on joining but has not done so in order to maintain the CTA and its open border with Northern Ireland,Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, D√°il Debates volume 450 column 1171 (14 March 1995) ; Minister for Justice, John O'Donoghue, D√°il Debates volume 501 column 1506 (9 March 1999); \\"Declaration by Ireland on Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland\\" attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. though in 1997 Ireland amended its Aliens Order to permit identity and immigration controls on arrivals from the United Kingdom.Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 1997 ; M. Wallace, D√°il Debates volume 510 columns 1400‚Äì1404 (16 November 1999). Identification requirements Most transport operators permit passengers to travel within the Common Travel Area without a passport, although photo ID is required for Irish or British citizens travelling by air, and Ryanair require all passengers to carry a passport or a national identity card. In 2014 a private member's bill was put before the Irish parliament which proposed to prohibit transport operators from requiring the production of a passport for travel within the Common Travel Area, but it was not passed. The Irish government in October 2015 started issuing passport cards, which are the same size as national identity cards of other EU countries and are accepted by all transport operators, but the issuing of a passport card requires the holder to already have a conventional passport book.

This mantra consists of twenty-three holy sounds. Jeung San Sangjenim, on whose teachings and spiritual work Jeung San Do is based, shared a meditative and spiritual practice aimed at transforming ourselves and society.Jeung San Do - Renewing Heaven and Earth  Meaning Ahn Gyung-jun, the sabunim of Jeung San Do, explains some of the sounds of the mantra as follows: = What is the sound hum? = According to Buddhism, hum (hoom) is \\"The mind of the Buddha.\\" Hum (hoom) is the mind of all enlightened beings. When you are immersed in the peaceful hum (hoom) sound, you can attain Buddha- mind. = Sound of chi (chee) = In Sanskrit, chi (chee) means \\"To become one with all brilliant spirits existing in the whole universe.\\" Sangjenim was the first to join the sounds hum (hoom) and chi (chee) together. Once they were joined, a new more fantastic meaning took shape. Sangjenim said, \\"Hum (Hoom) Chi (Chee) is the sound calling the parents of all things in heaven and earth.\\" = How to chant?= Whenever you chant Hum (Hoom) - chi (chee) - hum (hoom) - chi (chee), you should chant with the mind of calling out to your original parents. Some people mistakenly chant it with a sad and depressing voice, as if crying, causing such sad and depressive energy to respond. You should call out to your parents with bright energy. =Tae-eul Heaven= The next part of Tae-eul-ju is Tae-eul-cheon-sang-wun-gun. Tae-eul-cheon means \\"Tae-eul Heaven.\\" All the mysteries in the universe are contained in these three syllables. Tae means \\"ultimate.\\" Eul signifies the womb of the universe, which gives birth to all things including humanity. Tae Eul Cheon is the ultimate place from which all humans are born. Sang means \\"heavenly\\" or \\"supreme.\\" Wun means \\"fundamental\\" or \\"ultimate.\\" Gun (pronounce Goon) means \\"king.\\" Sang Wun Gun is the entity in charge of Tae Eul Heaven, the place in the universe from which life-giving energy comes. What does sa-pa-ha, the last three syllables, mean? It is a beautiful prayer asking that all of our wishes and desires be fulfilled.  Purpose Jeung San Do's meditation combines the chanting style of Buddhism with the inner alchemy of Taoism. When meditators immerse themselves in the peaceful sound of mantra, they feel a sense of oneness with the universe. Through the internal process of circulating the fire and water energies, the practitioner improves the condition of the body and cultivates spirit.  Four different powers  Tae Eul Ju has four different powers: ; H (Healing) : By chanting Tae Eul Mantra, you can heal yourself as well as healing others. ; E (Enlightenment) : By chanting Tae Eul Mantra, you can reach enlightenment faster than other mantra. ; P (Protection) : By chanting Tae Eul Mantra, you are protected from evil spirit and bad energy. ; S (Salvation) : When the time comes, GaeByeok, Tae Eul Ju Mantra will be used to save the world.

He is notable for his reforms of tertiary education as Minister for Employment, Education and Training, his period as Treasurer when he attempted to increase taxes in order to balance the budget and his abrupt exit from politics. Early life Dawkins was born in Perth, Western Australia. He attended Roseworthy Agricultural College in South Australia, gaining a Diploma in Agriculture, and then went on to the University of Western Australia, where he graduated in economics. Political career In 1974, aged 27, Dawkins was elected to the House of Representatives for the marginal seat of Tangney. He was defeated at the 1975 election by Liberal Peter Richardson. In 1977 Dawkins returned to the House as member for the safe Labor seat of Fremantle, succeeding Kim Beazley (senior), and defeating his son, Kim Beazley, for the Labor preselection. In 1980 he was promoted to the Opposition front bench and was Shadow Education Minister from 1980 to 1983. He became Minister for Finance following the election of the first Hawke government in 1983. In the second Hawke Ministry (1984‚Äì1987) he was Minister for Trade. From 1987 to 1991 he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training. It was in this position where he brought in a series of reforms of the higher education sector, which included expansion of Australian universities, the forced mergers of universities and colleges of advanced education, and the re-introduction of university fees (abolished by Kim Beazley senior in 1973) in the form of the HECS. This later became known as the Dawkins Revolution and aroused bitter opposition among academics and university administrators. A key supporter of Paul Keating, Dawkins became Treasurer following Keating's unseating of Hawke as ALP leader and Prime Minister, in his second and successful leadership challenge in December 1991. After Keating's unexpected victory in the 1993 federal election, Dawkins brought down a budget which contained a series of highly unpopular revenue measures which were seen as an attack on Labor's traditional supporters. The Cabinet, which had hitherto grudgingly accepted Keating's neo-liberal policies, rebelled against the Dawkins budget. Dawkins did not help his stock when he taunted Liberal MP Kathy Sullivan by calling her \\"sweetheart\\", angering several female MPs from his own party. In December 1993 Dawkins, frustrated at what he saw as the lack of economic realism of his colleagues, suddenly announced his resignation, and quit politics altogether soon after. It was during his farewell speech that he suggested that the date of presenting the Budget be moved from August to May, a practice that would be started by his successor Ralph Willis in May 1994. He was succeeded in Fremantle by former West Australian Premier Dr Carmen Lawrence. Post political career Since leaving politics, Dawkins has had an active business career. He has been non-executive Chair of Elders Rural Bank, LawCentral, Integrated Legal Holdings, The Retail Energy Market Company which operates the retail gas markets in South Australia and Western Australia, Fortuna Funds Management and director of Cbus superannuation, Genetic Technologies and MGM Wireless. In 2000 he was a made an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to the reform of international trade as foundation Chairman of the Cairns Group, to the reform of the federal budget, education and training, and to the Australian Parliament. In 2000, Dawkins's family agreed to use 104 hectares of their sizeable holdings of grazing land in Forrestdale outside Perth in a property venture where the profits from land sales would be invested in research and development for technology that is conducted at the CY O'Connor ERADE Village, including research laboratories, offices and accommodation, at the entrance of the twelve hectare estate. The development was believed to be worth around $100 million. In 2013 Dawkins was chairman of Vocation and earnt over a million dollars when it listed on the stock exchange. The company collapsed in 2015 and Dawkins has civil proceedings from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission regarding claimed contravention of disclosure provisions. His principal employment is as Director of Government Relations Australia, now GRACosway, a lobbying firm. He has also worked as a consultant to large Australian and foreign companies and the World Bank and the OECD. He has been awarded honorary doctorates from the University of South Australia, Federation University Australia and the Queensland University of Technology. He is currently board chairman of the gold exploration company Sovereign (). A cousin of the same name, John Dawkins, is a current Liberal member of the South Australian Legislative Council.

The steps involve removing the DNA from an oocyte (unfertilised egg), and injecting the nucleus which contains the DNA to be cloned. In rare instances, the newly constructed cell will divide normally, replicating the new DNA while remaining in a pluripotent state. If the cloned cells are placed in the uterus of a female mammal, a cloned organism develops to term in rare instances. This is how Dolly the Sheep and many other species were cloned. Cows are commonly cloned to select those that have the best milk production. On 24 January 2018, two monkey clones were reported to have been created with the technique for the first time. Despite this, the low efficiency of the technique has prompted some researchers, notably Ian Wilmut, creator of Dolly the cloned sheep, to abandon it.Roger Highfield Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning. The Telegraph. 16 November 2007 Tools and reagents Nuclear transfer is a delicate process that is a major hurdle in the development of cloning technology. Materials used in this procedure are a microscope, a holding pipette (small vacuum) to keep the oocyte in place, and a micropipette (hair-thin needle) capable of extracting the nucleus of a cell using a vacuum. For some species, such as mouse, a drill is used to pierce the outer layers of the oocyte. Various chemical reagents are used to increase cloning efficiency. Microtubule inhibitors, such as nocodazole, are used to arrest the oocyte in M phase, during which its nuclear membrane is dissolved. Chemicals are also used to stimulate oocyte activation. When applied the membrane is completely dissolved. Somatic cell nuclear transfer Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) is the process by which the nucleus of an oocyte (egg cell) is removed and is replaced with the nucleus of a somatic (body) cell (examples include skin, heart, or nerve cell). The two entities fuse to become one and factors in the oocyte cause the somatic nucleus to reprogram to a pluripotent state. The cell contains genetic information identical to the donated somatic cell. After stimulating this cell to begin dividing, in the proper conditions an embryo will develop. Stem cells can be extracted 5‚Äì6 days later and used for research. Reprogramming Genomic reprogramming is the key biological process behind nuclear transfer. Currently unidentified reprogramming factors present in oocytes are capable of initiating a cascade of events that can reset the mature, specialized cell back to an undifferentiated, embryonic state.

Oceanic anoxic events or anoxic events (anoxia conditions) were intervals in the Earth's past where portions of oceans became depleted in oxygen (O2) over a large geographic areas. During some of these events, euxinia, waters that contain hydrogen sulfide, , developed. Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years, the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past. Anoxic events coincided with several mass extinctions and may have contributed to them. These mass extinctions include some that geobiologists use as time markers in biostratigraphic dating. Many geologists believe oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to slowing of ocean circulation, climatic warming, and elevated levels of greenhouse gases. Researchers have proposed enhanced volcanism (the release of CO2) as the \\"central external trigger for euxinia\\". Background The concept of the oceanic anoxic event (OAE) was first proposed in 1976 by Seymour Schlanger (1927‚Äì1990) and geologist Hugh JenkynsHistory Channel, \\"The History of Oil\\" (2007), Australian Broadcasting System, Inc., aired: 2:00‚Äì4:00 pm EDST, 2008-07-08; Note: Geologist Hugh Jenkyns was interviewed in the History Channel's (re: footnote:3 History Channel, \\"The History of Oil\\" (2007)) documentary \\"The History of Oil\\" and attributed the matching occurrence high in the Apennine Mountains' meter thick black shale band put together with the findings from the Deep Sea Drilling Project as triggering the theory and work that followed from a beginning ca 1974. and arose from discoveries made by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) in the Pacific Ocean. It was the finding of black carbon-rich shales in Cretaceous sediments that had accumulated on submarine volcanic plateaus (Shatsky Rise, Manihiki Plateau), coupled with the fact that they were identical in age with similar deposits cored from the Atlantic Ocean and known from outcrops in Europe ‚Äì particularly in the geological record of the otherwise limestone-dominated Apennines chain in Italy ‚Äì that led to the realization that these widespread similar strata recorded highly unusual oxygen-depleted conditions in the world ocean during several discrete periods of geological time. Sedimentological investigations of these organic-rich sediments, which have continued to this day, typically reveal the presence of fine laminations undisturbed by bottom-dwelling fauna, indicating anoxic conditions on the sea floor, believed to be coincident with a low lying poisonous layer of hydrogen sulfide. Furthermore, detailed organic geochemical studies have recently revealed the presence of molecules (so-called biomarkers) that derive from both purple sulfur bacteria and green sulfur bacteria: organisms that required both light and free hydrogen sulfide (H2S), illustrating that anoxic conditions extended high into the illuminated upper water column. There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized scale such as algal/bacterial blooms and localized \\"dead zones\\". Dead zones exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay, in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat, the Black Sea (which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia, however), in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana. The current surge of jellyfish worldwide is sometimes regarded as the first stirrings of an anoxic event. Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and New Zealand. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide. This is a recent understanding. This picture was only pieced together during the last three decades. The handful of known and suspected anoxic events have been tied geologically to large-scale production of the world's oil reserves in worldwide bands of black shale in the geologic record. Likewise the high relative temperatures believed linked to so called \\"super-greenhouse events\\". =Euxinia= Oceanic anoxic events with euxinic (i.e. sulfidic) conditions have been linked to extreme episodes of volcanic outgassing. Thus, volcanism contributed to the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere, increased global temperatures, causing an accelerated hydrological cycle that introduced nutrients to the oceans to stimulate planktonic productivity. These processes potentially acted as a trigger for euxinia in restricted basins where water-column stratification could develop. Under anoxic to euxinic conditions, oceanic phosphate is not retained in sediment and could hence be released and recycled, aiding continued high productivity. Mechanism Temperatures throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous are generally thought to have been relatively warm, and consequently dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean were lower than today ‚Äì making anoxia easier to achieve. However, more specific conditions are required to explain the short-period (less than a million years) oceanic anoxic events. Two hypotheses, and variations upon them, have proved most durable. One hypothesis suggests that the anomalous accumulation of organic matter relates to its enhanced preservation under restricted and poorly oxygenated conditions, which themselves were a function of the particular geometry of the ocean basin: such a hypothesis, although readily applicable to the young and relatively narrow Cretaceous Atlantic (which could be likened to a large-scale Black Sea, only poorly connected to the World Ocean), fails to explain the occurrence of coeval black shales on open-ocean Pacific plateaus and shelf seas around the world. There are suggestions, again from the Atlantic, that a shift in oceanic circulation was responsible, where warm, salty waters at low latitudes became hypersaline and sank to form an intermediate layer, at depth, with a temperature of to . The second hypothesis suggests that oceanic anoxic events record a major change in the fertility of the oceans that resulted in an increase in organic-walled plankton (including bacteria) at the expense of calcareous plankton such as coccoliths and foraminifera. Such an accelerated flux of organic matter would have expanded and intensified the oxygen minimum zone, further enhancing the amount of organic carbon entering the sedimentary record. Essentially this mechanism assumes a major increase in the availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and possibly iron to the phytoplankton population living in the illuminated layers of the oceans. For such an increase to occur would have required an accelerated influx of land-derived nutrients coupled with vigorous upwelling, requiring major climate change on a global scale. Geochemical data from oxygen-isotope ratios in carbonate sediments and fossils, and magnesium/calcium ratios in fossils, indicate that all major oceanic anoxic events were associated with thermal maxima, making it likely that global weathering rates, and nutrient flux to the oceans, were increased during these intervals. Indeed, the reduced solubility of oxygen would lead to phosphate release, further nourishing the ocean and fuelling high productivity, hence a high oxygen demand ‚Äì sustaining the event through a positive feedback. Here is another way of looking at oceanic anoxic events. Assume that the earth releases a huge volume of carbon dioxide during an interval of intense volcanism; global temperatures rise due to the greenhouse effect; global weathering rates and fluvial nutrient flux increase; organic productivity in the oceans increases; organic-carbon burial in the oceans increases (OAE begins); carbon dioxide is drawn down due to both burial of organic matter and weathering of silicate rocks (inverse greenhouse effect); global temperatures fall, and the ocean‚Äìatmosphere system returns to equilibrium (OAE ends). In this way, an oceanic anoxic event can be viewed as the Earth's response to the injection of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hydrosphere. One test of this notion is to look at the age of large igneous provinces (LIPs), the extrusion of which would presumably have been accompanied by rapid effusion of vast quantities of volcanogenic gases such as carbon dioxide. Intriguingly, the age of three LIPs (Karoo-Ferrar flood basalt, Caribbean large igneous province, Ontong Java Plateau) correlates uncannily well with that of the major Jurassic (early Toarcian) and Cretaceous (early Aptian and Cenomanian‚ÄìTuronian) oceanic anoxic events, indicating that a causal link is feasible. Occurrence Oceanic anoxic events most commonly occurred during periods of very warm climate characterized by high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and mean surface temperatures probably in excess of . The Quaternary levels, the current period, are just in comparison. Such rises in carbon dioxide may have been in response to a great outgassing of the highly flammable natural gas (methane) that some call an \\"oceanic burp\\". Vast quantities of methane are normally locked into the Earth's crust on the continental plateaus in one of the many deposits consisting of compounds of methane hydrate, a solid precipitated combination of methane and water much like ice. Because the methane hydrates are unstable, except at cool temperatures and high (deep) pressures, scientists have observed smaller \\"burps\\" due to tectonic events. Studies suggest the huge release of natural gas could be a major climatological trigger, methane itself being a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide. However, anoxia was also rife during the Hirnantian (late Ordovician) ice age. Oceanic anoxic events have been recognized primarily from the already warm Cretaceous and Jurassic Periods, when numerous examples have been documented, but earlier examples have been suggested to have occurred in the late Triassic, Permian, Devonian (Kellwasser event), Ordovician and Cambrian. The Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which was characterized by a global rise in temperature and deposition of organic-rich shales in some shelf seas, shows many similarities to oceanic anoxic events. Typically, oceanic anoxic events lasted for less than a million years, before a full recovery. Consequences Oceanic anoxic events have had many important consequences. It is believed that they have been responsible for mass extinctions of marine organisms both in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. The early Toarcian and Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic events correlate with the Toarcian and Cenomanian-Turonian extinction events of mostly marine life forms. Apart from possible atmospheric effects, many deeper-dwelling marine organisms could not adapt to an ocean where oxygen penetrated only the surface layers. An economically significant consequence of oceanic anoxic events is the fact that the prevailing conditions in so many Mesozoic oceans has helped produce most of the world's petroleum and natural gas reserves. During an oceanic anoxic event, the accumulation and preservation of organic matter was much greater than normal, allowing the generation of potential petroleum source rocks in many environments across the globe. Consequently, some 70 percent of oil source rocks are Mesozoic in age, and another 15 percent date from the warm Paleogene: only rarely in colder periods were conditions favorable for the production of source rocks on anything other than a local scale. =Atmospheric effects= A model put forward by Lee Kump, Alexander Pavlov and Michael Arthur in 2005 suggests that oceanic anoxic events may have been characterized by upwelling of water rich in highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas, which was then released into the atmosphere. This phenomenon would probably have poisoned plants and animals and caused mass extinctions. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the hydrogen sulfide rose to the upper atmosphere and attacked the ozone layer, which normally blocks the deadly ultraviolet radiation of the Sun. The increased UV radiation caused by this ozone depletion would have amplified the destruction of plant and animal life. Fossil spores from strata recording the Permian-Triassic extinction event show deformities consistent with UV radiation. This evidence, combined with fossil biomarkers of green sulfur bacteria, indicates that this process could have played a role in that mass extinction event, and possibly other extinction events. The trigger for these mass extinctions appears to be a warming of the ocean caused by a rise of carbon dioxide levels to about 1000 parts per million. =Ocean chemistry effects= Reduced oxygen levels are expected to lead to increased seawater concentrations of redox-sensitive metals. The reductive dissolution of iron‚Äìmanganese oxyhydroxides in seafloor sediments under low-oxygen conditions would release those metals and associated trace metals. Sulfate reduction in such sediments could release other metals such as barium. When heavy-metal- rich anoxic deep water entered continental shelves and encountered increased O2 levels, precipitation of some of the metals, as well as poisoning of the local biota, would have occurred. In the late Silurian mid-Pridoli event, increases are seen in the Fe, Cu, As, Al, Pb, Ba, Mo and Mn levels in shallow- water sediment and microplankton; this is associated with a marked increase in the malformation rate in chitinozoans and other microplankton types, likely due to metal toxicity. Similar metal enrichment has been reported in sediments from the mid-Silurian Ireviken event. Anoxic events in Earth's historyCretaceous= Sulfidic (or euxinic) conditions, which exist today in many water bodies from ponds to various land-surrounded mediterranean seasdefinition of mediterranean sea; \\"6. surrounded or nearly surrounded by land.\\" such as the Black Sea, were particularly prevalent in the Cretaceous Atlantic but also characterized other parts of the world ocean. In an ice-free sea of these supposed super-greenhouse worlds, oceanic waters were as much as 200 meters higher, in some eras. During the time spans in question, the continental plates are believed to have been well separated, and the mountains we know today were (mostly) future tectonic events‚Äîmeaning the overall landscapes were generally much lower‚Äî and even the half super-greenhouse climates would have been eras of highly expedited water erosion carrying massive amounts of nutrients into the world oceans fueling an overall explosive population of microorganisms and their predator species in the oxygenated upper layers. Detailed stratigraphic studies of Cretaceous black shales from many parts of the world have indicated that two oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were particularly significant in terms of their impact on the chemistry of the oceans, one in the early Aptian (~120 Ma), sometimes called the Selli Event (or OAE 1a) after the Italian geologist Raimondo Selli (1916‚Äì1983), and another at the Cenomanian‚ÄìTuronian boundary (~93 Ma), sometimes called the Bonarelli Event (or OAE 2) after the Italian geologist Guido Bonarelli (1871‚Äì1951). OAE1a lasted for ~1.0 to 1.3 Myr. The duration of OAE2 is estimated to be ~820 kyr based on a high-resolution study of the significantly expanded OAE2 interval in southern Tibet, China. * Insofar as the Cretaceous OAEs can be represented by type localities, it is the striking outcrops of laminated black shales within the vari-colored claystones and pink and white limestones near the town of Gubbio in the Italian Apennines that are the best candidates. * The 1-meter thick black shale at the Cenomanian‚ÄìTuronian boundary that crops out near Gubbio is termed the ‚ÄòLivello Bonarelli‚Äô after the man who first described it in 1891. More minor oceanic anoxic events have been proposed for other intervals in the Cretaceous (in the Valanginian, Hauterivian, Albian and Coniacian‚ÄìSantonian stages), but their sedimentary record, as represented by organic-rich black shales, appears more parochial, being dominantly represented in the Atlantic and neighboring areas, and some researchers relate them to particular local conditions rather than being forced by global change. =Jurassic= The only oceanic anoxic event documented from the Jurassic took place during the early Toarcian (~183 Ma). Since no DSDP (Deep Sea Drilling Project) or ODP (Ocean Drilling Program) cores have recovered black shales of this age ‚Äì there being little or no Toarcian ocean crust remaining ‚Äì the samples of black shale primarily come from outcrops on land. These outcrops, together with material from some commercial oil wells, are found on all major continents and this event seems similar in kind to the two major Cretaceous examples. =Paleozoic= The boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods is marked by repetitive periods of anoxia, interspersed with normal, oxic conditions. In addition, anoxic periods are found during the Silurian. These anoxic periods occurred at a time of low global temperatures (although levels were high), in the midst of a glaciation. Jeppsson (1990) proposes a mechanism whereby the temperature of polar waters determines the site of formation of downwelling water. If the high latitude waters are below , they will be dense enough to sink; as they are cool, oxygen is highly soluble in their waters, and the deep ocean will be oxygenated. If high latitude waters are warmer than , their density is too low for them to sink below the cooler deep waters. Therefore, thermohaline circulation can only be driven by salt-increased density, which tends to form in warm waters where evaporation is high. This warm water can dissolve less oxygen, and is produced in smaller quantities, producing a sluggish circulation with little deep water oxygen. The effect of this warm water propagates through the ocean, and reduces the amount of that the oceans can hold in solution, which makes the oceans release large quantities of into the atmosphere in a geologically short time (tens or thousands of years). The warm waters also initiate the release of clathrates, which further increases atmospheric temperature and basin anoxia. Similar positive feedbacks operate during cold-pole episodes, amplifying their cooling effects. The periods with cold poles are termed \\"P-episodes\\" (short for primo), and are characterised by bioturbated deep oceans, a humid equator and higher weathering rates, and terminated by extinction events ‚Äì for example, the Ireviken and Lau events. The inverse is true for the warmer, oxic \\"S-episodes\\" (secundo), where deep ocean sediments are typically graptolitic black shales. A typical cycle of secundo-primo episodes and ensuing event typically lasts around 3 Ma. The duration of events is so long compared to their onset because the positive feedbacks must be overwhelmed. Carbon content in the ocean-atmosphere system is affected by changes in weathering rates, which in turn is dominantly controlled by rainfall. Because this is inversely related to temperature in Silurian times, carbon is gradually drawn down during warm (high ) S-episodes, while the reverse is true during P-episodes. On top of this gradual trend is overprinted the signal of Milankovic cycles, which ultimately trigger the switch between P- and S- episodes. These events become longer during the Devonian; the enlarging land plant biota probably acted as a large buffer to carbon dioxide concentrations. The end-Ordovician Hirnantian event may alternatively be a result of algal blooms, caused by sudden supply of nutrients through wind-driven upwelling or an influx of nutrient-rich meltwater from melting glaciers, which by virtue of its fresh nature would also slow down oceanic circulation. =Archean and Proterozoic= It has been thought that through most of Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen- deficient. During the Archean, euxinia was largely absent because of low availability of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.
