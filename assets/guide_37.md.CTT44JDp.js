Management and budget the executive director of the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization is Mr.Kiatchai Maitriwong. TGO's budget for FY2019 is 158.1 million baht. National goal Thailand signed the Paris Agreement on climate change on 22 April 2016. It submitted an \\"Intended Nationally Determined Contribution\\" (INDC) target for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions between 7‚Äì20% of the \\"business as usual\\" (BAU) scenario by 2020. By 2030 Thailand has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 20‚Äì25% from the BAU baseline. Objectives Section 7 of the decree establishing TGO prescribed TGO's objectives: # to analyse, scrutinise, and collect views and opinions in relation to the approval of projects, as well as to pursue and appraise authorised projects # to promote the market for greenhouse gas emissions trading # to be an information centre for greenhouse gas operations # to create a database of authorised projects and the approved trading of greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with policy determined by the national board # to enhance the efficiency as well as instruct public agencies and private bodies in greenhouse gas operations # to manage greenhouse gas management public relations # to support climate change operations Progress According to the Bangkok Post, in 2006, the year before TGO was established, Thailand emitted 232 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide (CO2), 44 million tonnes of that number from burning coal. By 2016, Thailand's CO2 emissions had risen to 342 million tonnes, 65 million tonnes of it from coal burning. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) numbers differ: it reports total emissions figures of 202 Mt in 2006 and 245 Mt in 2016. , Thailand's greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase. A slight reduction in the annual GHG growth rate of 3.3% in 2014 is attributed to greenhouse gas reduction measures and sequestration by forests.

Deliming operations of cattle hides usually last 2 hours and are generally associated with the alkaline phase of beamhouse operations. The progress of deliming in pelts is monitored by the checking of pH values of process liquors and in the cutting of a pelt cross- section. Phenolphthalein is used to monitor deliming pelt cross-sectional progress. Removal of pelt alkali and deswelling * As an acid is added it lowers the pH value of the internal pelt solution. This neutralizes the solution alkalinity. The lowering of the pH results in rapid protonation of the collagen basic groups. Lowering of liquor pH * The acid present in the deliming agents neutralizes the process liquor pH. Typical values after effective, thorough deliming will range from 6 to 9. Ammonium salt deliming pH values should be pH 8 to 9. Deliming types The deliming process can be done with acids that can be rapid in their pH adjustment. Buffering salts like ammonium salts predominated the 20th century. Ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride can be used as deliming agents and they follow the following chemistry: :(NH4)SO4 ‚Üí NH4+ (ammonium) + SO42‚àí (sulfate) The ammonium ion is then free to penetrate the pelt cross-section and further ionise to act as an acid: :NH4+ (ammonium) + H2O ‚Üí NH3 (ammonia) + H3O+ (hydronium) The protons can then serve two functions, namely to protonate basic groups of the collagen and neutralize solution alkali chemicals. Other weak acids can be used such as boric acid. acetic, formic, lactic acid, phosphoric acid and carbonic acid. Carbonic acid is used in a deliming process called carbon dioxide deliming. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid can also be used but their use is limited.

Major David Frakt of the United States Air Force Reserve, defending Mohammed Jawad, was challenging Hartmann's role in choosing Mohammed Jawad's case for prosecution. On August 14, 2008, Henley barred Hartmann from any further involvement in Mohammed Jawad's military commission. According to Mike Melia, writing for the Associated Press, Henley ruled that Hartmann: \\"...compromised his objectivity in public statements aligning himself with prosecutors and defending the Pentagon's system for prosecuting alleged terrorists.\\" However, Henley chose not to dismiss the charges against Jawad because of Hartmann's controversial conduct. He did rule that Frakt was authorized to submit arguments for dropping the charges against Jawad directly to Susan J. Crawford, the Convening Authority, as to whether charges against Jawad were justified. In July 2009, US District Court Judge Ellen Huvelle concluded consideration of Mohammed Jawad' habeas corpus petition, and was ruled a civilian. On July 28, 2009, Frakt filed a motion before Henley, following Huvelle's ruling. He argued that the military commissions were only authorized to try illegal enemy combatants, and since he was officially a civilian, his military commission lacked jurisdiction.

Its aims were to mobilize support for the Ethiopians during the Italian invasion of 1935-41, and to embody the unity of Ethiopians (Black people) home and abroad.Giulia Bonacci (2013), \\"The Ethiopian World Federation. A Pan-African Organisation among the Rastafari in Jamaica\\", academia.edu Sections were established in other parts of the Americas. Later, the EWF was given charge of an area of land in Ethiopia for housing returning emigrants. EWF sections in different countries became increasingly identified with the Rastafari movement even though it was originally aimed at everyone ready to defend the Ethiopians subjects and their empire from the fascist aggressors.  History  The EWF built on the efforts of African Americans who, in 1936, sent a delegation consisting of three prominent Harlem figures, all leaders of the black organization known as United Aid for Ethiopia. Reverend William Lloyd Imes, Pastor of the prestigious St. James Presbyterian Church, Philip M. Savory of the Victory Insurance Company and co-owner of the New York Amsterdam News, and Cyril M. Philp, secretary of United Aid, sailed to England in the summer of 1936 to speak with Emperor Haile Selassie concerning financial matters.William R. Scott, \\"Malaku E. Bayen: Ethiopian Emissary to Black America\\", tezeta.net In response, the Emperor empowered his personal physician Malaku E. Bayen as his special emissary. Bayen at first worked with United Aid for Ethiopia, but the next year he dissolved that body and founded the EWF to take its place. EWF was formally established on August 25, 1937 in New York City as The Ethiopian World Federation, Incorporated. It was originally a not-for-profit membership organization, incorporated in the State of New York. Later it was also registered by the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(4) organization, thus conferring tax-exempt status on the organization and its legal subsidiary bodies. The main purpose was set out in the following preamble: The EWF was at first made up primarily of Ethiopian students who came to America to study abroad, after the official coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie. It gained support from the Black community of Harlem, and deprecated the term \\"Negro\\" in favour of an African and Ethiopian identity. Bayen set up the EWF's newspaper, The Voice of Ethiopia, and led the project of federating the EWF. The first branch of the EWF outside the United States was set up in Kingston, Jamaica, and by 1940 there were EWF chapters in various parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. Bayen died in 1940 and was succeeded as leader by Lij Araya Abebe, then in 1943 by Elks Exalted Ruler Finley Wilson, by which time it had become a Black American organization rather than an Ethiopian-led one. As a direct result of the support Ethiopia received from black people in the West, mainly at that time African-Americans, during the Italian invasion of 1935-1941, the Emperor in 1948 granted five Gashas (approximately 200 hectares) of land near Shashamane to the EWF for Ethiopian people in the Diaspora who desired to return to the motherland. About 22 families moved to Shashamane, most of them Jamaican Rastafarians, most of the land was appropriated by the Derg military government in 1975, though a small number of Rastafarians remain to today. In 1983 the Jamaican branch of the EWF became a political party, the Imperial Ethiopian World Federation, representing the Rastafarian community there.

It was designed by Walter Netsch of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of Chicago. Construction was accomplished by Robert E. McKee, Inc., of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Originally controversial in its design, the Cadet Chapel has become a classic and highly regarded example of modernist architecture. The Cadet Chapel was awarded the American Institute of Architects' National Twenty-five Year Award in 1996 and, as part of the Cadet Area, was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2004. Architecture and construction The organ at the back of the Protestant Chapel, and the ceiling The most striking aspect of the Chapel is its row of seventeen spires. The original design called for twenty-one spires, but this number was reduced due to budget issues. The structure is a tubular steel frame of 100 identical tetrahedrons, each long, weighing five tons, and enclosed with aluminum panels. The panels were fabricated in Missouri and shipped by rail to the site. The tetrahedrons are spaced a foot apart, creating gaps in the framework that are filled with colored glass. The tetrahedrons comprising the spires are filled by triangular aluminum panels, while the tetrahedrons between the spires are filled with a mosaic of colored glass in aluminum frame. The Cadet Chapel itself is high, long, and wide. The front fa√ßade, on the south, has a wide granite stairway with steel railings capped by aluminum handrails leading up one story to a landing. At the landing is a band of gold anodized aluminum doors, flanked by gold anodized aluminum panels, designed and detailed to match the doors. The shell of the chapel and surrounding grounds cost $3.5 million to build. Various furnishings, pipe organs, liturgical fittings and adornments of the chapel were presented as gifts from various individuals and organizations. In 1959, a designated Easter offering was also taken at Air Force bases around the world to help complete the interior. The Chapel closed in September 2019 for a $158 million renovation and restoration project needed to address water damage. Netsch's original plans included a series of rain gutters just underneath the aluminum exterior of the Chapel's spires, but these were not built due to budget constraints, and the seams between the panels were caulked instead. Though the seams were repeatedly re-caulked over the years, decades of leaks left extensive water damage to the main floor. During the renovation, an enormous temporary \\"hangar\\" will be built over the existing structure; workers will then remove the aluminum panels and stained glass, install the originally- designed rain gutters, then replace all the panels and glass. The Chapel's furniture and pipe organs will be renovated as well. The project is scheduled to be completed by November 2022. Worship areas The Cadet Chapel was designed specifically to house three distinct worship areas under a single roof. Inspired by chapels at Sainte-Chapelle in France and the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi in Italy, architect Walter Netsch stacked the spaces on two main levels. The Protestant nave is located on the upper level, while the Catholic and Jewish chapels and a Buddhist room are located beneath it. Beneath this level is a larger room used for Islamic services and two meeting rooms. Each chapel has its own entrance, and services may be held simultaneously without interfering with one another. =Protestant chapel= Interior of the Protestant Chapel The Protestant Chapel is located on the main floor, and is designed to seat 1,200 individuals. The nave measures by , reaching up to at the highest peak. The center aisle terminates at the chancel. The building's tetrahedrons form the walls and the pinnacled ceiling of the Protestant Chapel. Stained glass windows provide ribbons of color between the tetrahedrons, and progress from darker to lighter as they reach the altar. The chancel is set off by a crescent-shaped, varicolored reredos with semi-precious stones from Colorado and pietra santa marble from Italy covering its area. The focal point of the chancel is a high aluminum cross suspended above it. The pews are made of American walnut and African mahogany, the ends being sculpted to resemble World War I airplane propellers. The backs of the pews are capped by a strip of aluminum similar to the trailing edge of a fighter aircraft wing. Above the narthex, in the rear, is a choir balcony and organ, designed by Walter Holtkamp of the Holtkamp Organ Company, and built by M. P. Moller of Hagerstown, Maryland. The organ has 83 ranks and 67 stops controlling 4,334 pipes. Harold E. Wagoner designed the liturgical furnishings for both the Protestant and Catholic chapels. =Catholic Chapel= Interior of the Catholic Chapel The Catholic Chapel is located below the Protestant Chapel, and seats approximately 500 people. The nave is wide, long and high. The focal point of the Catholic Chapel is the reredos, an abstract glass mosaic mural designed by Lumen Martin Winter and composed of varying shades of blue, turquoise, rose and gray tessera to form a portrayal of the firmament. Superimposed on the mural and depicting the Annunciation are two tall marble figures, the Virgin Mary on the left, and the Archangel Gabriel on the right. Above and between these two figures is a marble dove. In front of the reredos is the altar, a gift from Cardinal Francis Spellman, who dedicated the Catholic Chapel on September 22, 1963. The altar is Italian white marble mounted on a marble cone-shaped pedestal above which is a six- foot sculptured nickel-silver crucifix. Along the side walls of the chapel are the 14 Stations of the Cross, also designed by Lumen Martin Winter, and carved from four-inch (102 mm) thick slabs of marble. The figures are done in Carrara marble, from the same quarries where Michelangelo drew his stone. The classical pipe organ, in the 100-seat choir loft, was designed by Walter Holtkamp and built by M. P. Moller Co. It features 36 ranks and 29 stops controlling its 1,950 pipes. =Jewish chapel= Interior of the Jewish Chapel The Jewish Chapel is also on the lower level. Seating 100, it is circular, with a diameter of and a height of . It is enclosed by a vertical grill with inserts of clear glass opening to the foyer. The circular form and transparent walls were used to suggest a tent-like structure. The floor is paved with Jerusalem brownstone, donated by the Israeli Defense Forces. The walls of the foyer are purple stained glass panels alternating with green and blue stained accent windows. The circular walls of the synagogue are panels of translucent glass separated by stanchions of Israeli cypress. The paintings, done by Shlomo Katz in 1985 and 1986, depict a Biblical story. They are divided into three groups; brotherhood, flight (in honor of the Air Force) and justice. The focal point of the Jewish Chapel is the Aron Kodesh, which shelters the Scrolls of the Torah, to the right of which hangs the Ner Tamid. In the foyer of the chapel is a display cabinet with a Torah Scroll that was saved from the Nazis during World War II. It was found in Poland in 1989 in an abandoned warehouse and donated to the Jewish Chapel in April 1990. This \\"Holocaust Torah\\" is dedicated to the memory of all of those who fought against the Nazis. =Muslim Chapel= The Muslim Chapel is located on the lower level. It welcomes Muslims of all denominations. The mihrab is made of wood filled with the Quran and other Muslim books. Surrounded by Middle Eastern wooden art on its walls and the floor is blue and yellow with Middle Eastern designs.https://www.usafa.edu/academics/facilities/cadet-chapel/ =Buddhist Chapel= Buddhist chapel The Buddhist Chapel is a freestanding hall within the Cadet Chapel, donated in 2007. It measures 300 square feet and welcomes Buddhists of all denominations. The altar has a Burmese statue of the Buddha and near the entry is a figure of Avalokite≈õvara. =Falcon Circle= Dedication, 6 May 2011 The Falcon Circle is the newest of the Cadet Chapel's worship areas, dedicated in 2011. It was established through a request from followers of Earth-Centered Spirituality, an umbrella of traditions that includes Wicca, Paganism and Druidism. It is open to use by all religious communities to worship in a manner respectful of other faiths. =All-faiths rooms= The All-Faiths Rooms are worship areas for smaller religious groups. They are purposely devoid of religious symbolism so that they may be used by a variety of faiths. Distinguishing faith-specific accoutrements are available for each group to use during their worship services.

Biography K√∂hl was born in Neu-Ulm, Bavaria, as one of eight children. At the age of 19 he joined the German Imperial Army to become an officer like his father. At the beginning of World War I he was a Lieutenant in the W√ºrttembergisches Pionier-Bataillon Nr.13 (\\"13th W√ºrttemberg Pioneer Battalion\\"). After being wounded in the legs, which disqualified him for further service in the engineers, he volunteered to join the German Army Air Service. He became a pilot and later a commander of a Bomber Squadron, and received the Pour le M√©rite in 1918. He crashed his aircraft behind enemy lines and was captured and held as a POW in France, but managed to escape and returned to Germany. After the end of World War I he worked for the German Police and for the Reichswehr, but in 1925, he transferred to civil aviation and became the head of the Deutsche Luft Hansa Nightflight Branch in 1926. =Transatlantic flight= Bremen after the transatlantic crossing After Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic from West to East in May 1927, the idea of flying in the opposite direction, which is more difficult because of the prevailing winds, became more and more popular. In 1927, Ehrenfried G√ºnther Freiherr von H√ºnefeld bought two Junkers W 33 aircraft from the Junkers company in Dessau, naming them after the two Norddeutscher Lloyd flagships and . His plans were supported by Hugo Junkers. After some test flights, and breaking the record for flight duration, H√ºnefeld and K√∂hl flew to Baldonnel, Ireland, where they met James C. Fitzmaurice, the Irish Air Corps Commandant of the Baldonnel Aerodrome. On 12 April 1928, these three left Baldonnel in the Bremen and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, landing at Greenly Island on the south coast of Labrador, Canada. Even though they missed their intended destination, New York City, they were the first to cross the Atlantic by fixed-wing aircraft from Europe to America, almost nine years after the initial success at an east‚Äìwest crossing by a British rigid airship. For his feat, K√∂hl was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by Calvin Coolidge, the President of the United States. In 1935, K√∂hl lost his job with Luft Hansa. As a devout Catholic and a man of strong character he then retired to a small farm in the south of Germany, rather than curry favour with the National Socialists. Entry for 3 June 1935. K√∂hl died in Munich in 1938 from a kidney disease that he contracted during his flights. He was buried in Pfaffenhofen an der Roth. Tributes A German Luftwaffe Airbus A310 MRTT medevac aircraft, and the Bundeswehr barracks of the Transporthubschrauber- Regiment 30 in Niederstetten are named after Hermann K√∂hl. There is also a street in Bremen, near the airport, which was named after him.

It is possible to optimize a product by making minor adjustments. Typically, the goal is to make the product more desirable and to increase marketing metrics such as Purchase Intent, Believability, Frequency of Purchase, etc. Methods Multivariate optimization is one of the most common methods for product optimization. In this method, multiple product attributes are specified and then tested with consumers. Due to complex interaction effects between different attributes (for example, consumers frequently associate certain flavors with packaging colors), it is problematic to use mathematical methods, such as Conjoint Analysis, typically used in industrial process optimization.

The dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, defined in Pope Pius XII's 1950 apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus, is one of the most recent developments in the Catholic theology of the body. History The theology of the body has a long history and tradition within the Catholic Church. Early Church fathers wrote on the role of the body and its relation to the soul, often elevating soul over body. But like the soul, it is also created by God in his image. This is considered important even today, as the existence of a soul is the basis for much Church teachings on the human body, in areas such as abortion. Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of Hippo applied these views in their teachings on the human body, virginity and celibacy. Thomas Aquinas developed a systematic view, which dominated Church teachings and ecumenical councils including Vatican II. All recent popes contributed from different angles to the theology of the body. Current issues include the dignity of the body in light of its divine origin and destination, its eventual resurrection; virginity, the Christian sacrament of marriage, and derived issues such as faithfulness and contraception. Official Church teaching on the subject was stated in the encyclical Deus caritas est (On Christian Love) from Pope Benedict XVI, promulgated on Christmas, December 25, 2005. = Church fathers = Some early Church fathers, like Origen were preoccupied with the body and its impediments.Ramsey, 58 The theology of early Church fathers focused on the body in terms of its origin, condition before the fall of man, and destination and relation to the soul.Ramsey 56 Questions were raised as to whether the body may impede the soul in its attempt to be the image of God. These questions, addressed by the ancient Church, are relevant to a modern theology of the body, because they relate to concerns and definitions on the beginning and nature of human life.Ramsey, 17 Clement of Alexandria Clement of Alexandria (140?-220) viewed the body as the inferior partner in the body-soul relationship. The body tends to be sinful. The soul has three advantages over the body: it gives unity and life to the body; allows the body to reason; and is oriented towards God, while the body is oriented towards food and sex. The body is the grave of the soul, but also its residence, home and its vehicle.Ferdinand Gahbauer OSB, H√∂hepunkt der Sch√∂pfung, Heiligenkreuz 2008, 46 Clement believed that the first humans were innocent until they got trapped by the pleasures of the body.Ramsey 57 The first humans, by misusing their body, misused their free will and decided to sin. Origen  Like Clement, Origen (185-254?) was an African. Also like Clement, Origen considers the human body a prison of the soul. Only the soul existed in paradise, according to Origen, the body was taken on by Adam and Eve; as they were cast out of paradise.Ramsey, 59 The body tends to be oriented toward lust and sin, but it is also a creation of God. God created the body like a work of art in his image. This creation reflects God‚Äôs intelligence. The human body is (eikon) somehow similar to God. To be completed as a mirror of him, is the task for every Christian. Unlike the human body, the soul is an image of God. The body cannot be an image of God, otherwise God would look like a human being with a human body.Gahbauer 51 Only the soul can see God, but it is caught between the flesh and spirit. It constantly has to make a choice between the two. Origen suggests, that Christians should free themselves from bodily restrictions as much as possible in this life. The body is important however, in the context of resurrection.Gahbauer 52 Origen believes that only the resurrection of the body makes any sense. While he heeds Saint Paul, that the resurrection of the body will mean a new body, he insists, its identity must be recognizable. Yet, he states, our hope for resurrection is not one for worms, and our souls do not yearn for another decayable body.Gahbauer 54 Irenaeus Irenaeus The body, formed in the image of God, and the soul, which has adopted the Spirit of the Father, in harmony, make up the perfect human being The body, formed in the image of God, and the soul, which has adopted the Spirit of the Father, in harmony, make up the perfect human being, according to Irenaeus (died around 202).Gahbauer, 56 The Greek Gnosis and some Christians had looked down on the human body as inferior. Irenaeus defends the body because it is the creation of God and a negative view would cast shadows both over God and his creation. The story of creation in the book Genesis (later quoted by Pope John Paul in his lectures on the body) shows, that the first human being, Adam, was indeed an image of God. Adam had supernatural life, immortality, super-natural sanctity and a closeness to God. Since he was free of the human need to sleep, he could see God without interruption. By giving in to temptation, he lost all these attributes.Gahbauer, 57 The importance of Christ for the human body is the restoration of the original status before the fall. Those who accept Christ are redeemed and become children of God, regaining eternal life. However those who live only by their body and its needs, will not share eternal life.Gahbauer, 59 The resurrected bodies will show beauty beyond human imagination. To show the way to this destination, the Son of God became human, and accepted the human body, thus helping human beings to recognize their destination in God. Only by subjugating one‚Äôs will to the will of God, can this destination be reached, according to Irenaeus. Irenaeus believed that the first humans, Adam and Eve had a childlike relation to their body. They had no idea of evil, concupiscence and lust. They enjoyed a balanced sexuality, not ashamed as they kissed or hugged each other.Ramsey, 56 According to Irenaeus, the fall was a result of a childish lack of discretion, which made Adam susceptible to the devil and led him into disobedience to God. The fall was a result of na√Øvet√©, not of bad intention, according to Irenaeus.Ramsey, 57 Didymus the Blind Didymus the Blind (died around 398), who lived and taught in Alexandria, was blinded at the age of five. God, according to Didymus, created the human being with body and soul, both good, until the fall by Adam and Eve. Didymus believed that the soul continues to be an image of God, while the body does not.Gahbauer, 78 The unity of body and soul is therefore for Didymus a degradation for the soul. Limited by the body, it cannot develop. Whenever something higher mixes with something lower, an inferior mix is the consequence according to Didymus. He compares this with wine being mixed with water.Gahbauer, 79 The body has some functions for the soul. The body informs the soul of the sensual world around them. Didymus called the body the outer person and the soul the inner person. The outer person is perishable. The inner person is eternal. The heart of the person leads the person as a whole towards good or bad deeds. Didymus maintains freedom of will, which is however weakened through the fall of Adam of Eve. A person who uses his free will to be a spiritual person, dominating all subordinate material instincts, becomes similar to God. This similarity must be goal of all human undertaking.Gahbauer, 82 Gregory of Nazianzus Gregory of Nazianzus (330-390) contemplated on the origin of the human body. Man was created by God with body and soul, a visible and invisible part, like the angels. He was created to praise God like they did.Gahbauer, 90 The body was given to man, so he may suffer and eventually die, and thus not consider himself to be God. The material essence of the body separates us from God, like a cloud, or, as Gregory stated, like the cloud between the Egyptians and the Israelites.Gahbauer, 91 By giving man a perishable body, man was saved from the deep fall of Lucifer into eternal damnation. Gregory does not describe the human body before the fall, but he states that the bodily existence of man was free of any illness, needs or problems. The human body was related to God and free of sin towards him. The fall consisted in false pride, a revolt against God.Gahbauer, 91,92 Regarding the relation between body and soul, Gregory states, the body is related to the soul, like the way in which the soul is related to God. To explain human existence, Gregory uses the concept of light: God is the most sublime light, He cannot be penetrated or defined. He is followed by the angels, and then by human beings. Man is the image of God but only in his soul, not in his body.Gahbauer, 93 He is therefore also a mixture of eternal and temporal. The grace of God created the soul of man. His body was created for suffering, to overcome his pride. The soul is destined to lead the body and be purified like gold in a fire. The soul is oriented towards God and yearns to communicate with him. The human body is the lower element of the human person. Through the body, man experiences his temporal existence. But Gregory also admired human beauty and the bodily abilities to dream, sleep and memorize. The body can be both a friend and enemy of a person, according to Gregory. The final goal is a unity of the soul with God, which is possible with Grace and the assistance of the Holy Spirit according to Gregory.Gahbauer, 93-94  Gregory of Nyssa Gregory of Nyssa (335-394) was a bishop who wrote, among others, about the creation of the human body. Unlike Irenaeus, Gregory states, that the soul does not need to acquire the vision of God; it has this vision from the beginning.Gahbauer 95 The mixing with body and material things let the soul deviate from its divine vision and fall. Human efforts must therefore be oriented toward recreating this vision and thus participating in the Divine life. This can be done, so Gregory, by turning away from evil, and returning to God. A human being is defined not by his/her body but by his/her soul, with its spiritual and intellectual capacities.Gahbauer 97 The soul alone is in the image of God. Gregory also has a positive image of man by stating his freedom and independence. God is truly free and the freedom of man, even if limited, is an image of God. Not only his freedom, but also his ability to love - God is love - and his immortality, make man an image of God. Regarding the human body, Gregory opines that it is created for procreation. In that, humans are like animals; however, the human body also has the capacity for reasoning and perception. The body has three forms of life: the vegetative, sensual and intellectual. The human body derives its dignity from the fact that the Son of God had adopted it.Gahbauer 98 But Gregory also considers the human body a heavy weight on the soul. The destination of man is to achieve similarity to God, through purification. Sin, passion and ambition must be renounced. The sacraments of the Church are a great help. Gregory argues that God‚Äôs grace, not man‚Äôs efforts, determines an individual's ability to see God. God draws man upwards towards him.Gahbauer 104 He climbs step by step, without knowing where he is going. The soul is driven by its love for him, whom it has not found. The love of God, so Gregory, increases in the soul, the more it knows him.Gahbauer 105 Ambrose of Milan wrote that perpetual virginity is a noble gift which the Christian religion has bestowed on the world. Ambrose of Milan  To Ambrose of Milan, the body lives in a duality with the soul and must be subjugated. Control of the body is essential for Christian life. Total control is virginity. Virginity and perfect chastity consecrated to the service of God allows the body to become the image of God. It is to Ambrose one of the most precious treasures which Christ has left as his heritage to the Church. He asserted that perpetual virginity is a noble gift which the Christian religion has bestowed on the world. Virginity is not new or even Christian. Pagans imposed this way of life on the Vestals for a certain time. Ambrose writes, \\"We read that also in the temple of Jerusalem there were virgins. But what does the Apostle say?

I, c. 3, n. 12; PL XVI, 192. \\"Mary is the model of virginity: No wonder that the Lord, wishing to rescue the world, began his work with Mary.

Augustine of Hippo Augustine is the father of many contemporary theological views on the body. He dwelled at length on the condition of the human body before and after the fall. He was convinced that the heavenly state consisted in complete control of mind over body, especially in the area of sexuality.Ramsey 59 To illustrate this point, he notes, that some people can wiggle with their ears, nose or even hair, completely at their will. This condition of complete freedom and absence of lust existed for human sexuality too before the fall. The body must be controlled, and therefore Augustine like his teacher Ambrose considered virginity of the human body the superior way of Christ. He considered matrimony a triple blessing in light of its offspring, conjugal faith and being a sacrament: \\"In conjugal faith it is provided that there should be no carnal intercourse outside the marriage bond with another man or woman; with regard to offspring, that children should be begotten of love, tenderly cared for and educated in a religious atmosphere; finally, in its sacramental aspect that the marriage bond should not be broken and that a husband or wife, if separated, should not be joined to another even for the sake of offspring. This we regard as the law of marriage by which the fruitfulness of nature is adorned and the evil of incontinence is restrained.\\"St. Augustine De bono coniug., cap. 24, n. 32 He quoted St Paul saying that young girls should marry, arguing that they \\"should bear children to be mothers of families\\". Augustine was one of the first and most important Church fathers who wrote, that contraception is wrong: \\"Intercourse even with one's legitimate wife is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the offspring is prevented. Onan, the son of Juda, did this and the Lord killed him for it.\\"De coniug. adult., lib. II, n. 12, Gen, XXXVIII, 8-10. = Thomas Aquinas= Thomas Aquinas: The image of God in man is in three ways  Man the image of God Thomas Aquinas deals with a number of questions, most importantly, the question of man as image of God. > Since man is said to be the image of God by reason of his intellectual > nature, he is the most perfectly like God according to that in which he can > best imitate God in his intellectual nature. Now the intellectual nature > imitates God chiefly in this, that God understands and loves Himself. > Wherefore we see that the image of God is in man in three ways.The Summa > Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, Part > One, Article 4. Whether the image of God is found in every man? > http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1093.htm This means, according to Thomas, that man has a natural aptitude for recognizing, understanding and loving God. However, he requires His grace to do those things perfectly so he can finally attain \\"the likeness of glory\\".  Animals, the likeness of God  But are animals also created in the image of God? Thomas has a unique answer: in all creatures there is some kind of likeness to God, he argued. But in the thinking person, whom he called \\"the rational creature,\\" there is a likeness of \\"image\\"; whereas in other creatures we find a likeness by way of a \\"trace.\\"The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas Second and Revised Edition, 1920 Article 6. Summa Theologica, Whether the image of God is in man as regards the mind only?http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1093.htm Thomas explains the difference between trace and image. \\"An 'image' represents something by likeness in species, ...; while a 'trace' represents something by way of an effect, which represents the cause in such a way as not to attain to the likeness of species.\\" =Pope Pius XI = Catholic doctrine from early on and supported by the Council of Trent, considered virginity to be the holiest state for humans; however, marriage was allowed for those without the fortitude required to live an abstinent life. In Casti connubii, Pius XI repeatedly quotes Augustine, who teaches, that among the blessings of marriage, the child holds the first place. Pius XI also followed Augustine in upholding the indissolubility of marriage and the wrongfulness of sexual acts that impede conception: > Small wonder, therefore, if Holy Writ bears witness that the Divine Majesty > regards with greatest detestation this horrible crime and at times has > punished it with death. As St. Augustine notes, \\"Intercourse, even with > one's legitimate wife, is unlawful and wicked where the conception of the > offspring is prevented.Casti connubii, 55 Following this argument, Pius XI repeats that the conjugal act is intrinsically tied with procreation, but also acknowledges the unitive aspect of intercourse as licit. The encyclical affirms the Church's opposition to adultery and divorce, and speaks out against the eugenics laws, popular at that time, that forbade those deemed \\"unfit\\" from marrying and having children.Casti connubii =Pope Pius XII= Pope Pius XII in the years 1939-1942 delivered a series of lectures to the newly married couples of Rome which for decades became the basis for marital instruction in the US.Original Italian Edition: Il Papa Pio XII Agli Sposi, Roma, 1943; English: Dear Newly Weds, Pope Pius XII speaks to Married Couples; Farrar, Straus and Cudaby, New York Like Popes before him, and following the teachings of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius explained in Sacra virginitas that virginity is superior to marriage.Sacra virginitas, 32 He also rejects the view that the human body needs fulfillment of the sexual instinct for the sake of one's mental or physical health, or for the harmony of one‚Äôs personality.Sacra virginitas, 33 In this context he criticized the cult of the body and disorderly love of oneself. Ethics In a 1951 speech to midwives, Pius XII stressed the inviolability of the human body as a creation of God and stated his opposition to all forms of genetic mercy killings. The right to life comes directly from God, not from the parents.Utz Groner 512 He rejected any kind of sterilization as well. Like Pius XI, he extolled the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, a place for peace and love, requiring often heroism by both partners. Parents have a role, not only to give physical love, but also to give spiritual life to their offspring. Pius criticized the traditional male role in marriage, stating that while the male member is head of the family, he should also participate in domestic chores.Utz Groner 446 especially within families, where the mother is working full-time. Pius XII demands equal pay for equal work. Family planning  Regarding natural family planning methods, Pope Pius XII distinguished between engaging in sexual intercourse during infertile days and the specific selection of these days for intercourse. He argued that, if a marital partner entered marriage with the intention to have intercourse only during infertile days in order to avoid having offspring, the marriage contract itself would be invalid. If, on the other hand, the marital partner has intercourse during infertile days only occasionally but not exclusively, then the marriage is legitimate. The intention, not the actual use of marital rights, is decisive. Pius XII illustrates this with the notion that marriage includes both rights and obligations.Utz Groner, 521 Abstinence within marriage is also highlighted in his teachings. Pius took issue with the argument that abstinence is an impossibly heroic act. Citing Augustine, he argued that if natural union is not possible, abstinence is required. And, he added, in the time of World War II, so many acts of real heroism were required of men and women in so many countries, against which sexual abstinence paled in comparison.Utz Groner, 524 The human body and its needs should not be the centre of gratification but need to be sublimated to spiritual priorities that reflect the divine design and destiny. Marriage is not the highest value and human dignity must be preserved and applied in the marital act.Utz Groner, 530 The teachings of the Church reject a hedonistic view of the human body, while recognizing and valuing its divine origin and dignity. The Church thus protects the dignity of men against an over-emphasis on sensuality.Utz Groner 532 Body and soul Early Church writers, while defining the position of the body within theology, had focused a great deal of attention on the creation of body and soul. \\"The body of man was created by God\\" (de fide) according to the teachings of two ecumenical councils Lateran IV and Vatican I.Denzinger, 428, 1783 Pope Pius XII taught that the question of the origin of man's body from pre-existing and living matter is a legitimate matter of inquiry for natural science. Catholics are free to form their own opinions, but they should do so cautiously; they should not confuse fact with conjecture, and they should respect the Church's right to define matters touching on Revelation.Pius XII, Enc. Humani generis, 36 For these reasons, the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God. In an October 22, 1996, address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Pope John Paul II repeated the position of Pius XII adding: > In his encyclical Humani generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already > affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the > faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of > certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance > of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of > evolution as more than an hypothesis.John Paul II, Message to the Pontifical > Academy of Sciences on Evolution Mary and the resurrection of the body  To the Catholic Church, Pius XII's 1950 dogma of the Assumption is proof for the resurrection of the body from the dead. Pius was confident that the solemn proclamation and definition of the Assumption would contribute in no small way to the advantage of human society and individuals. He hoped that those who meditate upon the Assumption of Mary will be better able to withstand the pressures of a material life style, and look instead at the true destination of their own bodies: > ...in this magnificent way all may see clearly to what a lofty goal our > bodies and souls are destined. Finally it is our hope that belief in Mary's > bodily Assumption into heaven will make our belief in our own resurrection > stronger and render it more effective.MD 42. > ...by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter > and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to > be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever > Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed > body and soul into heavenly glory.MD 44. > Hence if anyone, which God forbid, should dare willfully to deny or to call > into doubt that which we have defined, let him know that he has fallen away > completely from the divine and Catholic Faith.MD 45. =Pope Paul VI = The central document of Pope Paul VI is Humanae vitae. The Pope begins with the statement that \\"the transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.\\" He claims that this is a source of great joy to them, although it means many difficulties and hardships. But there are global perspectives. A rapid increase in population has created the spectre of a world without food and other resources for all, and a temptation for State authorities to clamp down on population increase with drastic measures. The role of woman in society has been changing drastically; but most importantly, according to the encyclical, the advent of birth control devices requires a position on the part of the magisterium of the Church. Limited rights over the body  The Pope points to some Catholic dogma. Human procreation, like all questions of life, is a part of God's loving design. Married life takes its origin from God, who \\"is love.\\" Husband and wife cooperate with God in the generation and rearing of new lives.Humanae vitae, 8 Married love must therefore be more than a question of natural instinct or emotional drive. It is faithful and exclusive until death.Humanae vitae, 9 Parents are not free to act as they choose in the service of transmitting life, as if it were wholly up to them to decide what is the right course to follow.Humanae vitae, 10 Observing the Natural Law means that each and every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.Humanae vitae, 12 > Faithfulness to God's Design means to experience married love while > respecting the laws of conception and to acknowledge that one is not the > master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design > established by the Creator.Humanae vitae, 13 All artificial birth control > methods are unlawful as are all specifically intended to prevent > procreation‚Äîwhether as an end or as a means.HV 14 Lawful Therapeutic Means > are permitted if necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable > impediment to procreation should result, provided such impediment is not > directly intended for any motive whatsoever.Humanae vitae, 15 Recourse to > Infertile Periods applies to the spacing of births, arising from the > physical or psychological condition of the husband or wife, or from external > circumstances. The Church teaches that married people may then take > advantage of the natural cycle.Humanae Vitae 17,18 Scientists, as already > requested by Pius XII, should study natural rhythms as a secure basis for > the limitation of offspring.Humanae vitae, 24 Control of the body  Pope Paul fully realizes that Humanae vitae is not easy to follow. Some may argue that it teaches the impossible. He discusses the value of self-discipline of the body and self-denial of bodily pleasures as a source of family tranquility, peace, and personality development within the family.Humanae vitae, 21 He recommends chastity within marriage and appeals to public authorities not to tolerate any legislation that would introduce into the family practices that are opposed to the natural law of God. Social and economic development The Pope is fully aware of the developmental implications of this teaching. Regarding worldwide development he quotes Pope John XXIII that no solution is acceptable which violates man's essential dignity by reducing him to a materialistic concept. The only possible solution is social and economic progress of individuals and society, which respects and promotes true human values. This excludes misguided governmental policies, a lack of social justice, a selfish accumulation of material goods, and a failure raise the standard of living of people and their children.Humanae Vitae(23) The Pope sees a great potential for governments, national aid programs and especially for international aid organizations.Humanae vitae, 23 Christian compassion Christian couples face great difficulties at times: husbands and wives should take up the burden appointed to them: married couples should communicate their own experience to others. Thus the lay vocation will be included a novel and outstanding form of the apostolate.Humanae vitae, 26 Christian Compassion must be the guiding light. The Pope teaches that this doctrine of Christ on love and the uses of the body must always be joined with tolerance and charity: > As Christ Himself showed in His conversations and dealings with men. For > when He came, not to judge, but to save the world, was He not bitterly > severe toward sin, but patient and abounding in mercy toward sinners?Humanae > vitae, 29 =Pope John Paul II= John Paul II continued on the Catholic theology of the body of his predecessors with a series of lectures, entitled the Theology of the Body, in which he talked about an original unity between man and women,George Weigel, Witness to hope, The biography of Pope John Paul II New York, 2005, 336 purity of heart (on the Sermon on the Mount), marriage and celibacy and reflections on Humane Vitae, focusing largely on responsible parenthood and marital chastity.Weigel, 336-343 He links \\"the original unity of man and women\\" with the book of Genesis, and raises in this context questions such as why Christ put so much emphasis on human beings as male and female. He argues, Man becomes the Image of God in the moment of holy communion.Weigel, 336-337 =Pope Benedict XVI= In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI took up the concerns of his predecessors in his first encyclical, Deus caritas est,ENCYCLICAL LETTER DEUS CARITAS EST OF THE SUPREME PONTIFF BENEDICT XVI TO THE BISHOPS PRIESTS AND DEACONS MEN AND WOMEN RELIGIOUS AND ALL THE LAY FAITHFUL ON CHRISTIAN LOVE, Vatican City, 2005, where he raises some questions regarding Eros, body and the Church. (Did Christianity destroy Eros?Deus caritas est, 4 Doesn't the Church, with all her commandments and prohibitions, turn to bitterness the most precious thing in life? Doesn't she blow the whistle just when the joy which is the Creator's gift offers us a happiness which is itself a certain foretaste of the Divine?)Deus caritas est, 3  Nature of love  Benedict accepts that events in real life often just happen, rather than being planned nor willed.Deus caritas est, 33 What is imposed, is not voluntary. The encyclical does not mention the teachings of the Popes Pius XI through John Paul II on birth control and natural family planning. The late Pope, \\"my great predecessor\\" is, however, praised for his social teachings, on poverty and so on.My great predecessor John Paul II left us a trilogy of social Encyclicals: Laborem exercens (1981), Sollicitudo rei socialis (1987) and finally Centesimus annus (1991)(Deus caritas est, 27) Here I would clearly reaffirm what my great predecessor John Paul II wrote in his Encyclical Sollicitudo rei socialis when he asserted the readiness of the Catholic Church to cooperate with the charitable agencies of these Churches and Communities (Deus caritas est, 30) The encyclical focuses on a broad concept of love and not on prohibitions and definitions, which may anger some segments of the public. Benedict distances himself from \\"my sinful body, my enemy\\" views, but goes further when he warns against radical distinctions of ‚Äúgood love‚Äù, Agape, and ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúdirty‚Äù love, Eros and Sex. Benedict, while clearly recognizing degrading sexual misuses, complains that in the past these good-bad distinctions have often been radicalized within the Catholic Church. This is dangerous, because: > Were this... to be taken to extremes, the essence of Christianity would be > detached from the vital relations fundamental to human existence, and would > become a world apart, admirable perhaps, but decisively cut off from the > complex fabric of human life.Deus caritas est, 37  40th anniversary of Humanae vitae  The principles of Catholic faith are old as the scriptures, Benedict states. The Pope intends to focus on these eternal principles of Catholic faith. On May 12, 2008, he accepted an invitation to talk participants in the International Congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of Humanae vitae. He put the encyclical, which in his view, was very poorly understood, in the broader view of love in a global context, a topic, which he called ‚Äì \\"so controversial, yet so crucial for humanity's future.\\" Humanae vitae became \\"a sign of contradiction but also of continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition... What was true yesterday is true also today\\".Benedict XVI, international congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of the encyclical Humanae vitae, May 12, 2008 The Church continues to reflect \\"in an ever new and deeper way on the fundamental principles that concern marriage and procreation‚Äù. The key message of Humanae vitae is love. Benedict states, that the fullness of a person is achieved by a unity of soul and body, but neither spirit nor body alone can love, only the two together. If this unity is broken, if only the body is satisfied, love becomes a commodity.quoted from Deus Caritas Est Ultimately, Benedict says, Christian love grows out the love of Christ.

During his short career, the left-hander pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Mets, and Minnesota Twins. His collegiate career was spent at Florida State University (FSU). Draft Scarce, who batted and threw left-handed, was initially drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the twenty-sixth round of the 1969 amateur draft, but elected not to sign. In 1971, Scarce was the Phillies‚Äô eighth round selection (179 overall), subsequently signing on June 11, 1971. College and minor league career Scarce first played college baseball for Manatee Junior College, in 1968 and 1969. He then transferred to FSU, pitching for the Seminoles in 1970 and 1971. Scarce was used as a relief pitcher, enjoying considerable success at the collegiate level, while racking up 30 saves (SV) over the two seasons. In 1970, he allowed only 13 hits in 33 innings, a school record. These achievements contributed significantly to the team‚Äôs being able to advance to the national title game of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) College World Series (CWS), where they were defeated by USC, 2‚Äì1. (See 1970 NCAA University Division Baseball Tournament.) In 1971, the lanky lefty was the squad‚Äôs co-captain, recording 18 saves ‚Äî which stood as the NCAA single-season record for some time. Scarce advanced very rapidly and successfully through Minor League Baseball (MiLB). He spent part of the 1971 season with the Peninsula Phillies, in the A+ Carolina League, where he appeared in 20 games, compiling a 3‚Äì0 win‚Äìloss (W‚ÄìL) record, and a 1.29 earned run average (ERA). In 1972, Scarce pitched for the Reading Phillies in the AA Eastern League, going 4‚Äì0 with a 0.46 ERA in 23 games. That same year, following a brief stint with the AAA Eugene Emeralds, the parent-club Phillies sent for him. Major league career On July 10, 1972, at the age of 23, Scarce made his major league debut. He entered the game in Philadelphia in the eighth inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers and pitched 3-plus innings. He gave up a run in the ninth inning, allowing the Dodgers to tie the score 3‚Äì3. Then in the eleventh inning, he allowed hits to the first two batters (Tommy Davis and Manny Mota) and was lifted. Both Davis and Mota went on to score leading to the Dodgers 5‚Äì3 win. Scarce was given the loss. Overall, Scarce appeared in 159 Major League baseball games and recorded 21 saves (all with the Phillies) and a 6‚Äì19 record. Arm problems curtailed his career; they began in 1974 and worsened that fall, when Scarce believes he tore his rotator cuff. Scarce never started a game and in his 17 major league at bats, he never got a hit. Scarce played his last game on June 25, 1978.

He is the son of Kamau Muchunu from Kigumo. Political career Jamleck Kamau was first elected to represent the Kigumo Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya during the Kenyan parliamentary election, 2007 through the Party of National Unity (PNU). He later served as a cabinet minister in the government of Kenya's third president, Mwai Kibaki. During the 2013 General election, he was re-elected on a platform that simultaneously built on his record as a minister and MP and his strong support for the newly formed political party of establishment presidential candidate Uhuru Kenyatta, The National Alliance (TNA), which won the vast majority of parliamentary seats in Central Kenya and, together with the United Republican Party (URP) of William Ruto, went on to form a government under what was dubbed the \\"Jubilee\\" Alliance in 2013. Mr Kamau has voted in favour of all government-sponsored motions in parliament. In the run-up to the 2017 general election, Kamau emerged as the presumptive opponent to Francis Mwangi \\"wa Iria\\" for the post of County governor for Murang'a, with their rivalry drawing various county leaders to openly support either camp. In what appeared to be an indication of support by national players of the Jubilee alliance, Mr Kamau hosted parliamentary majority leader Adan Duale at a rally in Murang'a in December, 2016, at which Mr wa Iria's record as governor was attacked.

Born in Tullaroan, County Kilkenny, Maher first played competitive hurling in his youth. He made his senior debut during the 1893 championship and became a regular player over the next decade. During that time Maher won one All-Ireland medal and eight Leinster medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on four occasions. At club level Maher was a six-time championship medallist with Tullaroan and Johnstown. Maher retired from inter-county hurling during the 1905 championship. Playing careerClub= In 1895 Maher was in goal as Tullaroan faced Threecastles in the senior championship decider. A narrow 1-4 to 1-2 victory gave him his first championship medal. After missing Tullaroan's next championship triumph, Maher was back as goalkeeper when Tullaroan contested the 1899 final. Young Irelands provided the opposition, however, Maher collected a second championship medal following a 3-6 to 1-5 victory. Tullaroan failed to retain the title the following year, however, in 1901 the team were back in the county decider once again. A high-scoring 5-10 to 3-7 defeat of Threecastles gave Maher a third championship medal. Maher was appointed captain of the team in 1902, as Tullaroan reached yet another final. Mooncoin provided little opposition as Tullaroan powered to a 3-16 to 0-1 victory. It was Walsh's fourth championship medal. Three-in-a-row proved beyond Tullaroan, however, they qualified for a third final in four seasons in 1904. Once again the game turned into a mismatch, as a 6-14 to 1-6 defeat of Piltown gave Maher a fifth championship medal. In 1914 Maher was in the twilight of his career when he lined out his final championship decider, this time with Johnstown. A 3-1 to no score victory gave him his sixth and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Maher made his senior debut with Kilkenny during the 1893 championship campaign. He won his first Leinster medal that year as Kilkenny were granted a walkover by Dublin. On 22 June 1894 Kilkenny faced Cork for the very first time in an All-Ireland decider. After the original venue was unplayable the goalposts were uprooted and spectators and players alike moved to the Phoenix Park after a long delay. Cork, represented by Blackrock, gave an exhibition of hurling and led by 3-4 to 0-1 at the interval. Each side made exactly the same return in the second half to give Cork a 6-9 to 0-2 victory. After surrendering their provincial crown in 1894, Maher collected a second Leinster medal the following year as Dublin were defeated by 1-5 to 0-5. Tipperary, represented by Tubberadora, faced Kilkenny in the delayed All-Ireland decider on 16 March 1896. In the first decider to take place at what would later be called Croke Park, Tipperary tore into Kilkenny. Paddy Riordan is said to have scored all but one point of Tipp's total. Mick Coogan captured Kilkenny's only score of the game, as Tipperary claimed a massive 6-8 to 1-0 victory. Maher collected a third Leinster medal in 1897, as Kilkenny claimed the provincial title after receiving a walkover from Wexford. On 20 November 1898 Kilkenny faced Limerick in the All-Ireland decider, as both sides were hoping to win the title for the first time. \\"The Cats\\" got off to a great start and led by 2-4 to 1-1 at half- time. Limerick, however, powered on in the second half and used their new technique of hooking. They got two quick goals early in the half and scored the winning goal from a free after 52 minutes. At the final whistle Limerick emerged victorious by 3-4 to 2-4. Kilkenny retained the provincial title for the first time in their history in 1898. A 4-12 to 3-2 defeat of Dublin gave Maher a fourth Leinster medal. On 25 March 1900 Kilkenny once again faced Tipperary in an All-Ireland final. \\"The Cats\\" dominated for the opening twenty-three minutes, however, controversy reigned over hand-passed scores which were awarded to Kilkenny in spite of being illegal at the time. Mikey Maher of Tipperary scored a second-half hat-trick to help Tipperary to a huge 7-13 to 3-10 victory. Maher won a fifth Leinster medal in 1900 as Kilkenny narrowly defeated Dublin by 4-11 to 4-10. In 1903 Maher picked up a sixth Leinster medal. The game against Dublin ended in a 1-5 apiece draw, however, Kilkenny were subsequently awarded the title by the Leinster Council. Maher's side later trounced Antrim before lining out against Cork in the All-Ireland home final which wasn't played until 11 July 1905. Cork's Andy \\"Dooric\\" Buckley scored at least six goals as Kilkenny were humiliated by 8-9 to 0-8. Maher added a seventh Leinster medal to his collection in 1904 as Kilkenny recorded a 2-8 to 2-6 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final was delayed until 24 June 1906, with three-in-a- row hopefuls Cork providing the opposition. It was the beginning of a hugely successful era for \\"the Cats\\" as Cork were heading into decline. A first half goal by Dick Doyle put Kilkenny in the driving seat, while Maher made a great save in the dying moments of the game to help Kilkenny to a 1-9 to 1-8 victory. It was Maher's and Kilkenny's first All-Ireland triumph. In 1905 Maher won an eighth and final Leinster medal as Dublin were once again bested by 2-8 to 2-2.

A direct current (DC) generator, not using a permanent magnet, requires a DC field current for excitation. The field may be separately excited by a source of DC, such as a battery, or self excited by being connected to the armature of the generator so that the generator also provides the energy required for the field current. Generator field connections A shunt field (and any series resistor used for adjustment) may be directly connected across the armature terminals in parallel with the load. Where the machine has a series compounding winding, the field may be connected at the armature side (short shunt) or load side (long shunt). The different connections give different voltage regulation characteristics on load. So as it is connected in shunt it has constant characteristics. Characteristics Current in the field windings of a shunt-wound generator is (approximately) independent of the load current, because currents in parallel branches are independent of each other. Since field current, and therefore field strength, is little affected by load current, the output voltage remains more nearly constant than does the output voltage of a series-wound generator. There will be a small armature voltage drop on load, which will be reflected in the voltage applied to the shunt field. The output voltage in a DC shunt-wound generator drops slightly as load current increases because of the voltage drop across the armature resistance. Compound winding In a shunt-wound generator, output voltage varies inversely with load current. In a series- wound generator, output voltage varies directly with load current. A combination of the two types can overcome the disadvantages of both. This combination of windings is called a compound-wound dc generator.Everyman's Encyclopaedia, 1932, volume 5, page 248 See also * DC motor * Excitation (magnetic) References Category:Electrical generators ","title":"Shunt generator"},{"id":"18021558","text":"The Home Guard was any of several loosely organized militias in various states that were under the direction and authority of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Confederate Home Guard units worked in coordination with the Confederate Army, and were tasked with both the defense of the Confederate home front during the American Civil War, as well as to help track down and capture Confederate Army deserters. The Home Guard was a type of militia for the Confederacy. It had a rank structure and did have certain regulations, whether those were enforced or not. Home Guard units were, essentially, to be a last defense against any invading Union forces. They also were used at times to gather information about invading Union forces troop movements, as well as to identify and control any local civilians who were considered sympathetic to the Union cause. They received no military training, and although they could be drafted into the Confederate service if need be, there are only a few cases in which that happened. The Home Guard was recognized as a type of service to the Confederacy. It was often made up of older planters or others exempted from front line service. Citizens of some states also formed Unionist Home Guard units. For example, in Kentucky, the Home Guard consisted of Unionist men; Confederate sympathizers in the state, led by Simon Bolivar Buckner, formed militia groups known as the State Guard. Background and implementation Most Home Guard units consisted of volunteers and paid no salary. A bounty was offered by the Confederate government for the capture of deserters, although it was rarely paid, due to the government's debt. While most able-bodied Southern men went away to war, many stayed behind, either by choice or due to something that prevented them from serving in the army. Planters owning 20 slaves or more were exempted from service, with other family members exempted based on their total slaveholding. Although many states did not initially form Home Guard units, by 1863 all 11 Confederate states had done so. Initially tasked with being the defense force against any Union Army elements that might pass through the Confederate battle lines and enter into Southern territory, the Home Guard was later used to help capture Confederate army deserters returning to their homes. The Home Guard possessed a wide range of powers, whether those powers were legitimate and recognized by the Confederacy or not. As there were few younger Southern men at home, few could stand in the way of any Home Guard unit that wished to abuse its powers. In addition to this, due to the war demanding so much attention from the Confederate Congress, not to mention the other branches of the government and the military, little attention was paid to the Home Guard units. All were commanded locally, and rarely did they receive any specific direction. In essence, the Home Guard units could work as they pleased. More often than not they made their own decisions and priorities. Depending on the area, Home Guard units would be at times nothing more than a group of men identified as such, working from home as they pleased. At other times, most usually in states located in what was known as the Eastern theater of the war, Home Guard units had base camps and headquarters, went on patrol, and scouted for possible deserters or Union stragglers. Most of the time, Home Guard units were poorly equipped, due to shortages of goods, ammunition, and weapons to supply the Confederate Army. They rarely dressed in anything that could be called a uniform, but did make efforts to wear the same color clothing as the Confederate soldiers. By the middle of the war, many Home Guard units were composed of wounded soldiers that had returned to recover. Deserters that were encountered by Home Guard patrols were dealt with in many different fashions. At times, the deserting soldiers would be returned to the Army via Confederate units that were stationed near to whatever area the deserters were captured. Sometimes deserters were executed by the Home Guard. By 1864, the Union Army occupied much of the formerly Confederate-controlled areas. With Union forces now patrolling home-front areas, many Home Guard units disbanded to avoid being considered or mistaken for guerrillas, and it became increasingly difficult for the Confederacy to enforce any action against deserters who returned home. Even in the Western theater states of Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana, Union troops were regularly seen, and at times the troops had taken control of many towns or cities. Some Southern citizens who lived in those states and who did not support secession had now openly come out in support of the Union, often forming Union Army regiments or units to serve in that army. These newly formed Union units, made up of local citizens, personally knew the members of the Home Guard, which greatly hampered, if not completely disabled, the Home Guard's ability to function. By the war's end, very few such units were still in existence. However some were still active in areas where Union soldiers were less common, although these were mostly bands of thieves preying on the less fortunate. One of the most notorious of these was the Independent Rangers, led by early Old West outlaw Cullen Baker. In late 1864, this band was responsible for what became known as the Massacre of Saline, when they murdered ten unarmed men from Perry County, Arkansas, on the Saline River. In fiction * The film Free State of Jones (2016), starring Matthew McConaughey, portrays the Home Guard in Jones County, Mississippi as taking excessive taxes in goods from the women and children left on yeoman farms. * The Confederate Home Guard is featured in a major role in the novel Cold Mountain (1997) by Charles Frazier and the 2003 film adaptation of the same name, written and directed by Anthony Minghella. Both novel and film are presented from the point of view of a Confederate deserter, and the Home Guards hunting him are characterized as villains. *In Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone with the Wind (1936), the Home Guard fights General Sherman's army when it invades Atlanta. The soldiers fight bravely, but lose the battle and many are killed. This characterization was also portrayed in the movie by the same name adapted from the novel, which has been a huge success.

It is one of the oldest surviving church complexes. It was constructed on the site of the pillar of Saint Simeon Stylites, a renowned recluse monk. The church is popularly known as either Qalaat Semaan (, the 'Fortress of Simeon') or Deir Semaan (, the 'Monastery of Simeon').  History  Saint Simeon was born in 386 AD in the Amanus mountains village. He entered a monastery at the age of 16, but he was soon judged to be unsuited for cenobitic life due to his extravagant asceticism. Following the example of Saint Anthony, he attempted to live the life of a hermit ascetic in the wilderness, but his feats of physical endurance and self denial attracted pilgrims seeking religious instruction and other devout admirers. In an effort to escape from such distractions, he resolved to live on a small platform atop a 3-meter column. The height of the column was raised over time to 18 meters. From his perch, Simeon preached twice a day to the crowds who gathered to witness this spectacle or self-mortification. A ladder attached to he column allowed messengers to bring food and written messages to Simeon, who also sent letters to his followers this way. Such was his renown and reputation for sanctity that the eastern emperors Theodosius, Leo, and Theodosius III sought his advice a implored his intervention in state affairs. Simeon lived on the column for years, dying in AD 459 at the approximate age of 70. After a fierce contest for the possession of his remains between Antioch and Constantinople was settled in favor of Antioch, the solemn translation of his remains to Antioch was accompanied by a procession of the patriarch of Constantinople, 6 bishops, the Master-General of the East, 21 counts and tribunes and 6,000 soldiers. His tomb became a major pilgrimage destination. A few decades following Saint Simeon's death, a large monastic church (occupying over 5,000 square meters) was constructed in on the site where his pillar stood. The church was made up of four basilicas that emanated from the sides of a central octagon. The octagonal crossing was surmounted by a dome; at its center stood Simeon‚Äôs column. The church was the centerpiece of a walled monastic complex that included two minor churches, and pilgrim hostels. The remains of the pillar of Saint Simeon Stylites in 2000, before 2016 Russian airstrikes. Long abandoned and ruined, the site is part of the series of ruins referred as the Dead Cities of Syria. Until just recently, remains of the pillar of Saint Simeon still stood, despite having been whittled down to a block only a few meters tall from years of pilgrims cutting down small parts for themselves as relics; substantial surviving parts of the column shaft were last visible in the 17th century. The dome above it apparently survived until the 19th century.  Architecture  A Plan and Views of the Convent of St Simon Stylites, and of some Ancient Sepulchres, Richard Pococke, 1745 As opposed to many cathedrals that were constructed in medieval Europe, the idea of the church of Saint Simeon was born and realized as one project over a short span of time. It was designed in a cruciform made up of four distinct basilica complexes. The grounds for construction of the church were born by the imperial authorities who later promoted the course. Primarily, the high number of pilgrims who frequently flocked to the column of Saint Simeon to pray necessitated the construction of the church in 473 AD. The ambitious plan of the church of Saint Simeon complex portrays numerous architectural designs. The fundamental concept of the three-aisled basilica can be traced to the lasting traditions of the Romans. It is reported that the main basilica and the baptistery were the first to be constructed. Subsequently, the monastery and the fixtures to the baptistery followed. Ultimately, the other parts of the complex including the colossal arch on the Via Sacra concluded the construction process. Apparently, the best relics that are evident from the church of Saint Simeon are the massive arch that is located at the beginning of the start of the Via Sacra on the way to the cathedral on the mountain.Untener, Ken. Treasures of the Church. Cincinnati, OH: St. Anthony Messenger Press, 1998. Sound recording. Besides, two monasteries are visible from the church; a bazaar which is a few little housings, and a tomb chapel. The following are the numerous grouped buildings that were arranged at the complex. = The four-basilica church = The shaped like cross church was finely preserved, and it offers an excellent view in the spring with all the freshly blossomed flowers. When viewed from inside, the pillar of Saint Simeon is still apparent, only that it has been reduced to approximately 2 meters high boulder in the middle of the courtyard. The reduction in the length of the pillar can be attributed to many years of relic-gathering by pilgrims. The courtyard is octagonal and is bordered by four basilicas in the shape of a rood-tree and described as a four-basilica church. Apparently, the idea of a crucifix was to represent the crucifixion of Jesus on the cross. Evidently, the east basilica is considerably bigger compared to other basilicas. The more significant size can be attributed to the critical role it played in hosting all the key ceremonies, making it most important. = The U-shaped monastery = Bordering the south partition of the eastern basilica laid a chapel and a monastery. Originally, Deir Semaan (Simeon Monastery) bore the name of Telanissos and was established to make the most of the two productive plains that surrounded it. In the mid of the 5th century AD, the locals established a monastery on the plains and in 412 AD, Saint Simeon opted to be part of it. Later on, he left the locals to live there as he went to live in the mountain above the plains where the monastery was situated. = Baptistery = The baptistery was located on the opposite side of the southern basilica, down the sacred road known as Via Sacra. The baptistery was constructed shortly after the construction of the main church, and it served as a crucial part of the pilgrimage complex. The design of the baptistery was impeccable and was often regarded to be amongst the remarkable artifacts of the Christian architecture in the entire Syria. The baptistery was constructed in two phases; the baptistery itself and then some related little basilicas later. The baptistery took the form of an octagonal drum that lay on the top of the square base of the building. At some point, it was filled with a wooden roof, with shape either like a cone or dome. The inner octagon was covered in a rectangular outer building. Evidently, at the far end of the chamber to the east lays a semi-circular apsidole that encompasses a tunnel with steps heading down to its location. = Extensions to the Baptistery = The processional route guides towards the Deir Semaan (Simeon Monastery) emanates from the western side of the baptistery. Besides, at the opening of this road is the monumental arch, which comes from the monastery to the direction of the baptistery. The location of the church on the hill provides views of the surrounding countryside.  UNESCO  As of June 2011, the Church and surrounding village were designated by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as part of the \\"Ancient Villages of Northern Syria\\", a World Heritage site. There is much value attached to the building because of its representation of great sacrifice for a holy course as manifested by Saint Simeon.  Wars  Saint Simeon Church has continuously faced destruction by wars. = Arab-Byzantine War = The church was negatively affected by the Arab conquest during the agitation for the control of Syria between the Byzantines and the Arabs. Notwithstanding this, the Byzantines fortified the church even after such destruction. The complex was attacked and conquered by the Emir of Aleppo Sa'd al-Dawla, and it was considered a fortress. This compromised the symbolism of the complex as a holy site. This did not stop worshippers from continuing to visit the complex for the purpose of worship of God. = Syrian Civil War = The war in Syria has caused much damage to the historical sites because of the fighting between the opposing sides in the conflict. Additionally, the building has been destroyed by illegal digging and stone removal. The ruined building forms part of the ancient buildings on the Northern side of Syria, which have been ruined. The structure has been under threat from both the Syrian and Turkish governments through their conflict on the link contested by the two governments through the Bab Al-Hawa border crossing. On 28 May 2015, the church was captured by the Kurdish YPG/YPJ but was subsequently lost to factions opposing the Assad government. In May 2016 the Russian Air Force attacked the church, damaging the remains of the pillar of St Simeon as well as the rest of the ruins. By 8 February 2020, the hilltop near the site was occupied by the Turkish Land Forces.

Born in Tullogher, Lanigan first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-three when he first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. He made his senior debut during the 1904 championship. Lanigan went on the become a regular member of the team over the next decade, and won six All-Ireland medals and six Leinster medals. At club level Lanigan was a two-time championship medallist with Erin's Own. Lanigan retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1914 championship. In retirement from playing Lanigan became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with the Kilkenny senior team that claimed Leinster and All-Ireland honours in 1922, before later training the James Stephens GAA club team. Playing careerClub= Lanigan joined the Erin's Own senior hurling team at the turn of the century and became a regular member of the team. In 1905, Erin's Own qualified for the senior championship decider for the first time in their history. A 5‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì8 defeat of Tullaroan gave Lanigan his first Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship medal. Two-in-a- row proved beyond Erin's Own, however, the team qualified for final again in 1909. Mooncoin provided the opposition, however, a 1‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì7 victory gave Lanigan his second championship medal. =Inter-county= Early successes Lanigan joined the Kilkenny senior team in 1904. He subsequently collected his first Leinster medal as Kilkenny recorded a 2‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final was delayed until 24 June 1906, with three-in-a-row hopefuls Cork providing the opposition. A first half goal by Dick Doyle put Kilkenny in the lead, while goalkeeper Pat \\"Fox\\" Maher made an important save in the dying moments of the game to help Kilkenny to a 1‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì8 victory. It was Lanigan's and Kilkenny's first All-Ireland win. In 1905 Lanigan won a second successive Leinster medal as Dublin were once again beaten by 2‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì2. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 14 April 1907 saw Cork provide the opposition once again. The game was a high-scoring affair with Cork winning by 5‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì13. The game, however, had to be replayed as Cork goalkeeper Daniel McCarthy was a British army reservist and Kilkenny's Matt Gargan had earlier played with Waterford in the Munster championship. The replay was another high-scoring one, with Jimmy Kelly scoring 5‚Äì2 for Kilkenny. A puck-out by Cork's Jamesy Kelleher is said to have bounced and hopped over the Kilkenny crossbar. Kilkenny won the game by 7‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì9, with all seven of their goals coming in a thirty-minute spell. It was Lanigan's second All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny lost their provincial crown to Dublin in 1906 as the Tullaroan players withdrew from the team in a dispute over the selection policy, however, the team returned in 1907 with Lanigan capturing a third Leinster medal following a 4‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Dublin. On 21 June 1908 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider for the third time in four years. Jimmy Kelly scored three first-half goals while Jack Anthony scored Kilkenny's winning point at the end. Cork went on two late goal hunts, however, the final score of 3‚Äì12 to 4‚Äì8 gave Kilkenny the win. It was Lanigan's third All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland titles in 1908 by refusing to take part in the competition, however, the team returned in 1909. A 5‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì7 win over Laois gave Lanigan a fourth Leinster medal. The All-Ireland decider on 12 December 1909 pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary, a team that had never lost an All-Ireland final. Before the game itself there was internal fighting within the Kilkenny camp and a selection row left the team short of substitutes. In spite of this, the team still went on to win the game, courtesy of three goals by Bill Hennerby and a fourth by Jimmy Kelly. The 4‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì12 victory gave Lanigan a fourth All-Ireland medal. Three-in-a-row It would be another two years before Lanigan won his fifth Leinster medal. The 4‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì1 defeat of Dublin allowed Kilkenny to advance to the All-Ireland series once again. Limerick provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 18 February 1912, however, the pitch at the Cork Athletic Grounds was water-logged and the game was refixed for Thurles on 12 May 1912.

HistoryAtl√©tico Mexiquense= Atl√©tico Mexiquense Logo, 1997‚Äì2009 Atl√©tico Mexiquense was founded during the \\"Invierno 97\\" season, when the team Deportivo Toluca F.C. decided to purchase the team \\"Tolt√©cas\\" from Atl√©tico Hidalgo, (which were created in the \\"Invierno 96\\" season as part of the expansion of the Primera Divisi√≥n A).

As an elder, Parker led a group who separated from that church and formed the Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists. Parker is one of the earliest documented proponents of the doctrine of Serpent Seed among Protestant Christianity.Interpreting the Scriptures-The ‚ÄúTwo Seed‚Äù Heresy Early life Daniel Parker was born on April 6, 1781, in Culpeper County, Virginia. He was the oldest son of John Parker, a former Continental soldier, and Sarah (White) Parker. The family moved to Elbert County, Georgia around 1785. Daniel professed conversion before the Nail's Creek Baptist Church in Franklin County, Georgia, and was baptized on January 19, 1802. He married Patsy Dickerson on March 11, 1802. In 1803, John & Sarah, Daniel & Patsy, and other Parker family members moved to Dickson County, Tennessee. Before the Parkers moved to Tennessee, the Nail's Creek church had licensed Daniel to the ministry. In August 1803, Daniel and Patsy settled on Turnbull Creek. The Turnbull Baptist Church was organized by fourteen members (mostly the Parker family) in the home of John Parker in April 1806. The Turnbull Church ordained Daniel Parker as a minister of the gospel on May 28, 1806. Daniel and Patsy moved to Crawford County, Illinois in December 1817, shortly before Illinois entered the Union. Daniel Parker's son, Dickerson Parker, was a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto. Religious leadership Elder Parker was one of the earlier ministers to speak out against the \\"missions\\" movement. In 1820, while living in Vincennes, Indiana, he released a booklet entitled \\"A Public Address to the Baptist Society, and Friends of Religion in General, on the Principle and Practice of the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions for the United States of America.\\" The Baptist Board of Foreign Missions, organized at Philadelphia in 1814, is best known as the Triennial Convention, but its official name was the \\"General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in the United States.\\" Objections by Baptists to the Convention were based on both soteriology and ecclesiology. He was a strict Predestinarian, but his chief objections in the booklet are based on ecclesiology - for example, \\"They have violated the right or government of the Church of Christ in forming themselves into a body and acting without of the union.\\" Several important preachers on the east coast led in the \\"anti-missions\\" movement, but Parker was the leader on the frontier, and probably spoke best to the common man. It appears that during this time, Parker was also formulating views on God and man that he would first release in his Views on the Two Seeds (1826). He taught that all persons are from the moment of conception either of the \\"good seed\\" of God or of the \\"bad seed\\" of Satan (the children of the good seed are roughly equivalent to the \\"elect\\" of Calvinism, and those of the bad seed similar to the \\"non-elect\\"), and were predestined that way from the beginning; nothing a person can do can change one from God's seed to Satan's or vice versa. Therefore, mission activity was not only unbiblical and sinful but, as a practical matter, useless since the \\"decision\\" was already made prior to birth.See Parker's A Supplement or Explanation of My Views on the Two Seeds and The Second Dode of Doctrine on the Two Seeds. Dealt Out in Broken Doses Designed to Purge the Arminian Stuff and Dross Out of the Church of Christ and Out of the Church of Christ and Hearts and Heads of Saints . Many consider his theory a type of Manichaeism. Parker's views on the \\"two seeds\\" were spread rapidly, and many members of the \\"anti-missions\\" movement accepted his doctrine, though it never achieved anything near majority status. In 1834, he and many of his followers migrated to the Texas frontier. Texas was still part of Mexico and the government would allow no organization of Protestant churches in the region. Parker determined to organize a church before he arrived in Texas. The Pilgrim Predestinarian Regular Baptist Church was constituted July 26, 1833 in Illinois. It still exists today, near Elkhart, Texas, though as \\"Primitive\\" rather than \\"Two-Seed.\\" Daniel Parker's name is almost synonymous with \\"anti-missions\\", but he was one of the important frontier preachers in Texas, leading in the organization of about nine churches in the eastern part of the state. Death He died December 3, 1844 at the age of 63 and was buried in the Pilgrim Cemetery in Elkhart, Texas; his wife Patsy survived him by less than two years and is buried with him.

It is one of four stone crosses originally used as waymarkers along the medieval route from Wigan to Chorley. The cross no longer stands in its original position, having been moved across the road in 1922 as part of a road widening scheme. Structure Mab's cross is a scheduled ancient monument. The monument is the remains of a 13th-century boundary cross in Standishgate, Wigan. The cross was moved from a site on the opposite side of the road in the early-20th century. The grade II* listed structure has a metre-square, high dressed plinth made of two courses of rectangular gritstone blocks. Mounted diagonally on the plinth is a large square cross base with the stump of the cross shaft set into it. On the plinth is a metal plaque relating the legend of Lady Mabel Bradshaigh. HistoryLegend= According to local legend the cross is named after Lady Mabel Bradshaigh. The legend, recorded in a family history published in 1645, says that when Sir William Bradshaigh, her husband, failed to return from the crusades she married a Welsh knight. When Bradshaigh unexpectedly returned from a ten-year campaign, he murdered his wife's new husband in Newton-le-Willows while he was trying to escape. Retrieved on 19 June 2008. Lady Mabel did penance for her bigamy by walking from Haigh Hall to a stone cross in Wigan \\"bare footed and bare legged\\" once a week for as long as she lived. In another version of the legend, recorded by Norris of Speke in 1564, the Welsh knight is named as Henry Teuther, Sir William is absent for seven years on pilgrimage rather than a crusade and the penance involving the cross is not mentioned. Retrieved on 19 June 2008. =Reality= Sir William Bradshaigh and his wife were real people. William Bradshaigh married Mabel Norris, the heiress of Blackrod and Haigh, in 1295. His absence was not due to a pilgrimage or crusades. On 1 November 1315,'The city and parish of Manchester: Introduction', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 174‚Äì187.

The rebellion ended when the Deputy Sheriff of Lancashire defeated the rebels in battle north of the River Ribble. Bradshaigh escaped and was outlawed. In 1319, it was assumed he was dead but he returned to his estates after the Earl of Lancaster's execution following defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322. He was convicted and imprisoned in Kenilworth Castle, and later Pontefract Castle, before he was released in 1324. Rather than killing his wife's husband at Newton-le-Willows, it was Sir William Bradshaigh who was slain there on 16 August 1333 in a fight with members of the Radcliffe family. There is no evidence that Lady Mabel remarried, either before or after her husband's death, or that she did penance at the cross. After her husband's death she funded the creation of two chantry chapels at Blackrod and Wigan. A figure kneeling before a wayside cross featured on her tomb and within 50 years of her death Mab's Cross had taken on her name suggesting there was a connection.

This old saying was birthed in 1901 after George Eyube died from an accidental shot fired from his own pistol during a patrol from Orokpo to Orhuwhorun with an attempt of bringing the people under firmer control. The Orhuwhorun people are sometimes referred to as Ugbede and Obodo people, they reside in the north eastern part of Udu Local Government Area of Delta State Nigeria. The land is surrounded by neighbouring communities. Ekete in north, Owhrode in the south, Egini in the east and Usieffrun (Urhiephron) in the west. Some communities like Ovwian, Arhagba and Igbogidi form boundaries in the south-west and the south-east of Orhuwhorun. According to the 2006 census figures Udu local government has a population of 142480 and Orhuwhorun is inclusive. Orhuwhorun has grown to be the second prominent and fast developing town in the Udu environ, due to the establishment of Delta Steel Company housing complex built in the 1970s for its workers. With this township Orhuwhorun developed and moved from being a rural area to an urban center. The Urhobo language predominantly spoken by them is known as Udu. In customs, they have a distinct annual festival that includes, Unueje, \\"Chechegbe\\" masquerade, and an annual epha female festival\\" literally known as \\"emeteyavwon\\" and \\"jabojawo\\" at which initiated daughters parade the streets of the town half naked to mark the coming of a new age. http://www.waado.org/urhoboculture/Religion/tonukari/urhobo_community_two_worlds.htm. They also have to themselves an autonomous kingdom which was obtained from Aka (Benin) by a man named Okaka from eyenduvwon now Ekrovie quarters around the year 1715 to 1717 . The king in Orhuwhorun as in every other Urhobo communities is called the Ovie and greeted as Oghievworo! Oghievworo!! Osieran!!! wo su ton, and he is assisted by the council of chiefs and elders (Iletu, Ilorogun, Igbu-irue and Irehren).. Urhobo Times Press Ltd. (See The Festival's Parade in Praise of Daughters by Gibson Fenfe) Account of migration Oral interviews and myth from legends and published sources has it that Orhuwhorun founding father named Omiere migrated from the present day Uwheru in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. They migrated around the 15th century to the present-day Otor-udu. Omiere and his group were not the only migrants that moved out from Uwheru. Owerhiave and his wife Ekperhie left Uwheru around the same time the Omiere party left and founded Ekwerhe in Agbarho. Also Enyuto, a part of Oyede in Isoko, was said to have moved out from Uwheru at the same time when Omiere migrated. Another man also migrated from Uwheru and formed a part of Ibredeni in Ndokwa local Government Area of Delta State. Villages that migrated from Uwheru formed Amassama and Kokori and Ibredeni in the Kwale division. There was a war between the Omieres and the Ijaws in which Egi and Sogun, the two Ijaw warriors were killed in retaliation for the death of a man in Omiere's camp. This conflict led to the migration of Omiere and his people to the present-day Udu Local Government area. Migration from Uwheru to Otor-Udu According to oral myths, the present-day Otor-udu is where Omiere and his family first settled following a clash with the ijaw warriors. The family traveled south and pitched a camp near the present day Otorogo gas plant. Before long, they had another problem of insecurity with Ovo. Ovo was the rebel supreme commander of the fighting force of Udu. He was said to be envious of Omiere's military might. At one time Ovo had a secret plan to wipe out Omiere and his people. He made the Orhuwhorun (Omiere) people to dig a big hole in the ground and work in it. While the Omiere people were busy in the pit, he poured buckets of boiling water in the pit with the intention to roast them alive. Unfortunately for him, Omiere escaped with his family and pushed further north again to a new place called Owhrode. However, the Orhuwhorun people are believed to have been settled in Otor-Udu before the Udu party came. The relics and confirmation of the first arrivals in the area is the belief of the Orhuwhorun man, that the remaining Udu groups came much later and so whenever the other Udu groups wants to talk about the Orhuwhorun man, they respectfully refer to them as ‚ÄúOrhuwhorun -ekpako‚Äù which means the Orhuwhorun people are seniors This is a common belief among the people that gives authenticity to the longevity of the Orhuwhorun people in the Udu environment. The present day Owhrode community in Udu local government area of Delta state, about a 2 kilometers south away from the present abode of Orhuwhorun was where Omiere moved his family to and settled temporarily for some years after he escaped from Ovo leadership force. Here, he removed his residence further to find their present location which was named after one of the earlier arrivals as Ugbede and later changed to Obodo before changing finally to Orhuwhorun in 1976. The name Orhuwhorun is a corrupt form of Orho- Ughweru which literary means a village from Uwheru. Their migration from Owhrode to their present abode was necessitated by water scarcity. In other word they moved out from Owhrode in search of regular water supply. It was this unbearable situation that made the Omiere people to move their residence further south in search of a land that has rivers and streams. This natural quest to get a better form of existence drove them further toward their present abode Orhuwhorun where they saw a natural permanent water supply which they were looking for Some personalities from Orhuwhorun 1\\\\.

The organisation serves as a platform to promote Szekler autonomy. History The Council was founded on October 16, 2003. Its first president was J√≥zsef Csap√≥, who served until late 2006, when he resigned. Until the Council held a new presidential election in February 2008, in which Bal√°zs Izs√°k emerged victorious, the president ad interim had been Imre Fodor, the former mayor of T√¢rgu Mure≈ü. Doctrine Szekely Land as envisaged by the Szekler National Council The floating flag of Szekler National Council The Council wants to obtain self-government for the Sz√©kely Land. It looks to the historical fact that the Sz√©kely Seats were the traditional self-governing territorial units of the Transylvanian Sz√©kelys during medieval times. (Saxons were also organised in Seats.) The Seats were not part of the traditional Hungarian county system, and their inhabitants enjoyed a higher level of freedom (especially until the 18th century) than those living in the counties. Their autonomy was granted in return for the military services they provided to the Hungarian Kings. The Council also claims the rights of Sz√©kelys to self-determination, as guaranteed by the Treaty of Trianon. Officially, the treaty was intended to be a confirmation of the concept of the right for self- determination of nations.Saladin F., The Babylonian Code - Vol. One: The Unholy Scriptures, GRIN Verlag, 2011, p. 464 The SZNC hopes to obtain self- determination for the Sz√©kely Land on the Catalan model.

A unique A-frame structure, it was supplemented with a skeleton tower in 1928. History The Gull Rocks obstruct the passage north of Rose Island, and in the mid-19th century the Old Colony Steamboat Company took steps to mark the reef. Initially an employee of the company was stationed on the rocks with a horn; later, a lamp on a post was erected. In 1885 the Lighthouse Service made its first request to replace this lamp with a federal lighthouse, but the replacement was not constructed until 1887. The wooden A-frame house was unlike anything else in the area, and it had neither tower nor lantern room. Instead, a lamp was hung in either gable: red on one end, and white on the other. The unique roof caused some problems with the usual practice of collecting rainwater in cisterns, as it was prone to contamination from salt spray. The first keeper, Frederick Purinton, was badly injured in 1894 by an assailant believed to be a local lobsterman, and quit the post two weeks later. In 1900 the original lamps were replaced by brighter lanterns, but the same arrangement of hanging them obtained. Then in 1928 a small skeleton tower was erected next to the house, sporting an acetylene lamp. The station survived the devastating hurricane of 1938 and was manned until 1960, when the light was automated and the house demolished. In 1969 construction of the Newport Bridge, which passes immediately adjacent to the rocks, rendered the light useless, and the tower was likewise removed, leaving the tiny oil house as the sole remaining trace of the station.

Foundation and politics After the withdrawal of the Syrians from Lebanon, Fouad Abou Nader restarted his public activities in launching the Liberty Front. The Liberty Front considers itself a defender of Lebanon sovereignty, independence and freedom, heir of the \\"Front for Freedom & Man\\" (in Arabic ÿ¨ÿ®Ÿáÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ±Ÿäÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ≥ÿßŸÜ pronounced Jabhat al Hurriyah wal Insan) founded in 1975 by Dr. Charles Malik who evolved later on to the Lebanese Front and the political offspring of the Resistance of the Front‚Äôs parties and movements fighters who cooperated together in the \\"Lebanese Forces Command Council\\" since 1976 before uniting their forces in 1980 in the Lebanese Forces under the leadership of President Bachir Gemayel and fought against the Palestinian organizations and the Syrian army between 1975 and 1986. ;Principles and project Principles Nation-state and citizen identity: Citizenship should always take precedence on any other affiliation, religious or sectarian or other. The Lebanese political society is composed of several religious minorities, with no chance that any minority might ever rule alone. Relying on the help of foreign powers, and allowing them to intervene in Lebanese internal affairs has often ruined democracy and repeatedly destroyed Lebanon, its economy and the notion of common destiny. A large majority of the Lebanese long for freedom, security, dignity, stability and equal opportunity. That can be only delivered by a modern, truly independent, and sovereign civil state. A comprehensive political project could bring a solution to the permanent national crisis Lebanon has been experiencing for decades. This project is proposed as a base for negotiations among the Lebanese people and their different communities. A national debate around this proposal should be created in order to discuss it with any individual or community in good will. The project This project has many aspects; starting with the political basis and then the economy, education, health care, freedom of expression, women‚Äôs rights and other aspects of public life. In Politics 1\\\\. New social contract with a unified code of Personal Status, law applied to all and social advancement as reward for work, efforts and skills: The negotiation and adoption of a new modern and realistic national charter among the Lebanese communities, which should take into consideration the fact that any one community is a minority no matter how big a minority it is. Define clearly the relations between the citizen and the state regardless of a citizen‚Äôs community, religion, color, race or beliefs. (Equal rights and Universal Declaration of Human Rights drafted for the United Nations by Charles Malek, founder of the Front for Freedom and Man in Lebanon). Declare the fact that Lebanon is a state that is here to stay as a perennial home for its citizen, all its citizen. Should be set up: a unified civil code of Personal Status, a State of Law and Justice recognizing the citizen rights, whilst demanding from them duties and applying the same laws to all and a State of skills in which everyone would have a chance and could attain social success, because social advancement will be the reward for their work, their efforts and competence. 2\\\\. Regionalism and governance 2.0: The notion that every region of Lebanon is as important to its citizen as is Beirut the capital leads to the concept of regionalism, meaning that local representatives are elected to run the daily business of their region, deciding of local development projects, education, health, urbanism, tourism, hydro-electric resources, industry and agriculture planning, environment ‚Äì particularly garbage collection and treatment ‚Äì, ecological and other protections of natural sites. The advantage of regionalism is to give every region and its inhabitants the possibility of maintaining their cultural inheritance and the specific aspects and traditions of their daily life. It also enhances the accountability of regionally elected officials due to their proximity with their electoral base. Bringing development to the citizen within his region will ultimately allow him to stay in the land of his ancestors and bind him to his land. To make up for the shortcomings of the Central State, regionalism must be established, that is to say local governance, extensive decentralization and decisions taken by the first parties concerned. Just as the rivalry between the Phoenician cities made the prosperity of Phoenicia, a healthy economic and social competition between the regions are today needed in order to boost Lebanon‚Äôs development in all its regions. In the framework of its fight against corruption, Lebanon should go to governance 2.0, that is to say e-government and e-administration. For that, it could start at the local level with e-municipalities. 3\\\\. International recognized positive & permanent neutrality: An internationally recognized, permanent and positive neutrality. This means that Lebanon should not take sides in inter-regional conflicts, that it will adopt a positive stance when Arab countries have a common policy, will always try to have good relations with western or other countries, and will always be in the Arab camp in case of a conflict with neighboring Israel. An internationally recognized, permanent and positive neutrality will prevent Arab and foreign countries from interfering in Lebanon‚Äôs internal affairs, that it will also prevent Lebanese parties and communities from seeking the support of foreign powers and drawing their strength from these powers. Lebanon‚Äôs independent foreign policy is recognized in the Alexandria Protocol which led to the formation of the League of Arab States. 4\\\\. Electoral system: Responsible, representative governance requires clear representation of electorate‚Äôs will, and that can be achieved by adopting the principle of single electoral districts, one district for each electoral seat (one man one vote). This is what is called: first-past-the-post segment of the polls. 5\\\\. Conflict with Syria: Concerning the former state of conflict between Lebanon and Syria, and in order to normalize relations between the two countries, it is required to organize the return of all detainees presently in Syrian jails, and complete information about those who died in detention in Syria, and the return of their remains to their families. 6\\\\. Displaced people: Displaced people within Lebanon have to return to their homes, without any further delay. The government of Lebanon and the regional leaders should understand that this is a legal and humanitarian issue, it is also a crucial step on the road to internal reconciliation among the Lebanese communities. 7\\\\. The Lebanese Diaspora: Lebanese expatriates should have the right and possibility to participate in the Lebanese electoral process in their respective countries of residence and get members in the Lebanese Parliament. Lebanese expatriates who participate in a very consistent manner to the economy of Lebanon through money transfers and deposits in Lebanese banks should be encouraged and motivated to invest in economic development projects in Lebanon through proper legislation. A legal mechanism should be created to give back Lebanese citizenship to those expatriates who for some reason have lost it, and give them good reasons to do so. 8\\\\. Defense and security: The Lebanese armed forces and other government security agency should have the exclusive right to bear and use weapons insides Lebanese territory. No other military or para-military organization should be allowed to do so. To solve the problem of existing Lebanese para-military organizations, a regional National Guard should be created under the authority of the national government of Lebanon, and to gradually absorb all those different groups into one National Guard‚Äôs corps. 9\\\\. Resettlement of Palestinians: The resolution of the Palestinian tragedy can not take place at the expense of Lebanon. A solution outside Lebanon has to be found for the fate of more than 500,000 Palestinians living in dire conditions in Lebanon. Palestinian passport should be granted to them as it was given to the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The Lebanese society cannot and should not absorb this number of Palestinians, this is a question of national security. Decree No. 5247 which was illegally issued on June 20, 1994, granting Lebanese nationality to Palestinians, Syrians and other Arabs, should be annulled. As for the Palestinian armed groups inside Lebanese territory, as per the decision of the Parliament to cancel the Cairo Agreement, they should be completely disarmed, and the security of Palestinian refugee camps handed over to the Lebanese armed forces. No other authority except that of the Lebanese state should be tolerated on Lebanese territory. 10\\\\. The Ta√´f agreement: Formulas, such as the National Pact (1943) and the Taef agreement (1989), could not save us from war, occupation and bankruptcy. The provisions of the Ta√´f agreement created an imbalance in the structure of constitutional powers in Lebanon. That, this agreement was signed under duress. That its provisions have to be reviewed and rewritten by duly elected representatives of the Lebanese people meeting in congress, and on Lebanese soil, without the intervention of any foreign power. The paragraphs pertaining to the fraternity between Syria and Lebanon as nil and without any effect since Syria was not a signatory of the Ta√´f agreement. The Fraternity Treaty signed between Lebanon and Syria during the Syrian occupation should be cancelled. 11\\\\. Lebanese Syrian relations: Relations with neighboring Syria should be normalized, and all issues still holding back this normalization resolved. A solution outside Lebanon has to be found for the fate of more than 1,500,000 Syrians living in dire conditions in Lebanon. The Lebanese society cannot and should not absorb this number of Syrians, this is a question of national security. The Lebanese government should be the only authority allowed to negotiate future relations with Syria. Since Lebanon has no pretention to any parts of Syrian territory and does not allow itself to get involved in Syrian internal affairs, then there is no reason for delaying the final and official drawing of border lines between the two sovereign countries. 12\\\\. Conclusion: The ultimate goal is to put a final end to the power struggle among Lebanon religious communities. The political mentality of the Lebanese has matured enough to be able to sit together around a table in all free will and decide together how to shape a future democratic and neutral Lebanon. The Economy 1\\\\. Regional development in Lebanon is required to support the economy in general. Adopting regionalism will give the different regions of Lebanon the legal tools to proceed with their own development within general development guidelines sit by the government of Lebanon. 2\\\\. The Lebanese legislator should start enacting laws allowing and giving incentives for micro-credit banking, investments in small and medium sized businesses, agricultural transformation industry, high-tech industry and tourist industry. And those specific incentives should be created for those investments in above said sectors if they are located in regions outside the Beirut belt. Environment, education and health care Lebanese are looking forward towards a free education and medication for all. 1\\\\. Education: Amend legislation no. 686 in the compulsory and free education to include the youth up to the age of 16 years rather than the age of 12, and the obligation to ensure its resolute application. Establish a mutual fund for needy families to help them cover school fees for their children. 2\\\\. Hospitalization: Establish a Health Care cooperative to cover for citizens who do not enjoy any security or cooperative or private insurance. 3\\\\. Environment: Adopt renewable energy, provide the incentives to municipalities to encourage adoption of solar energy, recycling of waste, especially paper, glass and plastic materials. Recycling will provide an additional financial pipeline for municipalities. 4\\\\. Water supply: Develop a comprehensive plan to solve the water crisis via the establishment of dams and water wells, lakes and the rationalization of the public not to waste water. Information Technology, High Tech, Digital, Gaming, Programming Lebanon should be turned into a leading hub in the Middle East for high tech, for digital, for gaming, for information technology and for programming companies by means of passing relevant laws that will secure protection of intellectual property, financial incentives and tax reductions. These companies will provide graduating students thousands of new jobs opportunities. The youth and national commitment The foundation of a modern civil state starts by building up a good and committed citizen. It is necessary to amend both, school and university curriculums to include applied civil programs which will gradually transform the student into a qualified and dedicated citizen. It allows him to engage in the civil society and the public sector. A project should be established in order to secure education loans for students similar to ‚Äúkafalat‚Äù project whereby the terms of the loan are encouraging. Women‚Äôs rights Based on the ratification by Lebanon of the Fourth World Conference on Women (Action for Equality, Development and Peace) convened by the United Nations (UN) in Beijing (China) and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) of the UN, women should get all of their rights in line with the modern requirements of the times, and to set apart, as the first stage, a quota of ‚Äú30%‚Äù of total parliament representations. Giving women their rights, will reflect to the world Lebanon‚Äôs cultural and civilized image. Freedom of expression through a free press Freedom of expression is the most prominent attribute that has differentiated Lebanon from its neighbors, since old times. Free media should be supported and protected to keep it the true expression of Lebanon‚Äôs realities.

He had been a trainee with Hans Eleonardus M√∏ller, Sr. at an early age, from 1813, and then bought his first ship in 1818, sailing from Porsgrund to Copenhagen. Timber and iron were traded for grain. While losing the ship at sea, he replaced it by investing in new ships. The trade routes were later expanded to the Baltic Sea. In 1834 he acquired burghership, and expanded his business as a grain and timber merchant and ship-owner. B√∏yesen was active in the local community. First, he was a benefactor for the literary circle Porsgrunds L√¶seselskab, founded by Jens Gasmann in 1833. For the purpose of general enlightenment, B√∏yesen founded the Henrik Wergelands Almuebogsamling, a public library.Byens liv. Foreninger, organisasjoner og selskaper.

In his political views, he was described by one historian as proto-Liberal Party (political parties did not exist until 1884), having been vocally supported by later Liberal Party founder and Prime Minister Johan Sverdrup in their common opposition of Conservative Anton Martin Schweigaard during the 1860 debate on the Merchant Shipping Act (Sj√∏fartsloven). B√∏yesen went bankrupt in July 1867, following general economic hardships. The city had seen only one bankruptcy in 1866, but 32 from 1868 to 1871. This depression was partially caused by the difficult transition from wooden to steam ships. Four months after his bankruptcy, B√∏yesen died.

(formerly MEMC Electronic Materials) is a renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world. In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, marking the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation. Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent ‚Äì which eventually fell through ‚Äì to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016., eventually emerging in December 2017 as a restructured, smaller, private company.

To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing. It will continue operations during bankruptcy. The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money. When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company's recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner's work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million. During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion, and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44. On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company's trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share. According to the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúSunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.‚Äù During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity. As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison's board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company's leaders were ‚Äúoverly optimistic‚Äù but did not make ‚Äúmaterial misstatements‚Äù or commit any fraud. In July 2017, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved SunEdison's bankruptcy-exit plan and it eventually emerged from bankruptcy December 29, 2017.https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sunedison-emerges-from- bankruptcy  SunEdison companies  * SunEdison, Inc. :* SunEdison's solar materials group produces granular polysilicon, silicon-crystal ingots, silicon wafers, and specifies the production of solar cells and solar modules.

This is a delicious fried cake which base is one of the most characteristic features of culinary taste of Northeast of Paraguay: cassava (cassava Manihot = Manihot util√≠sima, \\"family plant of Euphorbiaceae which roots are edible and for its high content of starch used to produce a flour which is high in protein).  Origin of name  While the word \\"Lambreado\\" is a degeneration of the correct \\"Lampreado\\" there is little data about the origin of the name of this fried cake made of cassava, known in Paraguay as mandioca, and beef. In Paraguay, a Castilian-Guarani bilingual country, and in Northeastern Argentine (where the Guarani language is also spoken) it is also called \\"payagu√° mascada\\", an allusion to one of the tribes of the Guarani people (\\"payagu√°es\\") who populated the Paraguayan geography in pre-Columbian times.  Ingredients  There are several varieties of \\"Lampreado.\\" The more traditional ingredients are as follows: cassava/mandioca, boiled and ground beef, garlic, onion, salt, oil and breadcrumbs. In other varieties that are heavier on the stomach (but which according to many are tastier), pella or pork fat is used, and the starch and cassava are mixed with raw meat.  Preparation  The preparation process is simple. The cassava is peeled and cooked in salted water until it is reasonably soft but not too soft. It is then mashed and mixed with ground beef, garlic and onions previously fried in oil, and salt and breadcrumbs. With this mixture, you get ‚Äúsmall cakes‚Äù, or more properly \\"tortillas‚Äù which are fried in oil. To reduce its caloric value and its heaviness it's recommended that you serve the tortillas with a mixed vegetable salad.  Further details of interest  The Lampreado can be kept for several days, and it is ideal for the \\"avio\\" (definition taken from the Royal Academy of Spanish Language: \\"Among pastors and country people, the provision taken to feed the herders for as long as it takes them to return to town or the farmhouse\\"), also provisions taken by travelers and \\"troperos\\" (mainly cattle drivers) to eat during their journey. In the area of the department of Misiones, Paraguay, it's called \\"Lambreado\\", what elsewhere is known by the name of \\"marinera\\", made with either beef or chicken. * According to some scholars of the social history of Paraguay, all the popular Paraguayan cuisine was consolidated as a small family industry after the War of Paraguay against Triple Alliance (Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, 1864 and 1870) This was very blunt in caloric content because of the situation of the country after the war made food scarce, for which reason the entire Paraguayan cuisine has high protein content in response to the fact that daily meals were limited.

Its equivalent for members operating with an Arms Corps Unit within a warlike area of operations is the Army Combat Badge. History The ICB was first established in July 1970 for recognition of infantry service in battle or on operations, following the decision of the Military Board in January 1970. The role of the infantry is to seek out and close with the enemy, to kill or capture him, to seize and to hold ground, to repel attack, by night and day, regardless of season, weather or terrain. The purpose of the ICB is to recognize this unique role and the particular training, skills and hardships attendant upon service as an infantryman. In exceptional circumstances, the ICB may be awarded to members of other corps, where they have qualified for it as infantrymen. In January 1970, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Daly KBE, DSO, as the Chief of the General Staff and part of the Military Board, laid the original basis for the ICB. He is recorded in the minutes as saying, \\"whilst he appreciated the views expressed (in the Military Board), it was to be borne in mind that the proposed badge was meant to be a visible distinction for the infantryman and was not a general combat badge. He said the other corps had their responsibilities and neither their worth nor performance, were in question. However he could not accept that an infantry award should be granted to members of other corps unless they qualified for it as infantrymen.\\"Minute 7/1970 of the Military Board, dated 23 January 1970. Quoted in DI(A) PERS 97-5 Issue: 9/2008. The Army Combat Badge (ACB) was instituted in 2005 to recognise the unique service of a member operating with an Arms Corps Unit within a warlike area of operations. Specific eligibility Any member of the Australian Army who: * was on continuous full-time service as an infantryman at the time of deployment; * has given satisfactory service as an infantryman; * has served either a continuous or an aggregate of 90 days satisfactory service on warlike operations for a single deployment or operation; and * has not been previously issued the ICB. Under exceptional circumstances, the Approval Authority may approve the issue of the ICB to members on exchange/attachment duties for service with allied units who meet the criteria, and/or to members who would have met the criteria had they not been killed, wounded, disabled or evacuated.

He was one of the first explorers of the White Nile basin. Life Knoblechar was born in the small village of ≈†kocjan in Lower Carniola. He studied at the secondary school in Rudolfswerth (now Novo Mesto), at the lyceum and the theological seminary in Laibach (now Ljubljana), and at the College of Propaganda in Rome. On 9 March 1845 he was ordained a priest, and a year later graduated as a doctor of theology. When the Vicariate Apostolic of Sudan was established on 3 April 1846, the Congregation of Propaganda selected Knoblecher as one of the missionaries for the region. Before leaving for central Africa he spent eight months in Lebanon and at other places in Syria to acquaint himself with the rites and customs of the Oriental Christians. Towards the end of September, 1847, he left Cairo in company of Maximilian Ryllo, S.J., the Pro-Vicar Apostolic of Central Africa, and four other missionaries, and arrived at Khartoum on 11 February 1848. Here they established a school for young Africans whom they had purchased in the slave-market and who subsequently assisted them on their missions. Through them Knoblecher became acquainted with languages spoken in the interior of Africa, and was soon enabled to compile a sort of dictionary of these languages. When Father Ryllo died on 17 June 1848, Knoblecher succeeded him as pro-vicar apostolic. From Khartoum Knoblecher made an expedition into the interior of Africa in the fall of 1849. He ascended the White Nile (Bahr-el- Abiad) and was the first European to penetrate into the land of the Bari people, as far as 4¬∞ 10‚Ä≤ N. In 1850 he went back to Austria to recruit missionaries and collect money for the African missions. He returned to Africa in 1852 with five new missionaries, established a mission among the Bari tribe at Gondokoro, and in 1854 another among the Dinka or Jangeh people at Angweyn (Heiligenkreuz). The missionaries were hampered by European merchants and slave-traders. Bad health cut short the lives of many of them, and Knoblecher himself died in Naples while making a journey to Europe to convalesce. Accounts of his travels in Eastern North Africa were published in Jahresberichte des Marienvereins (Vienna, 1852‚Äì58). His extensive ethnographical and ornithological collections are preserved in museums in Vienna and Ljubljana, and the studies that he prepared on the Dinka and Bari languages are in the Austrian National Library.

This was his first solo album after being dismissed from Fleetwood Mac in 1972, and his solo career was being managed by ex-Mac manager Clifford Davis. Demo tracks for this album were released on CD in 2000 as Ram Jam City. Reception Allmusic critic Joe Viglione declared that Second Chapter was a feather in the cap for Kirwan as well as producer Martin Rushent. Drawing comparisons with the music of Lindsey Buckingham, Paul McCartney and America, he highlighted the title track, \\"Love Can Always Bring You Happiness\\" and \\"Silver Streams\\" as the best tracks. He also stated that the album shows Kirwan's importance as a pop artist, and that Fleetwood Mac would have benefitted from his presence in their very successful mid-70s line-up.

It was created by Lala Mustafa Pasha in the 1570s, soon after the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus, and was part of the larger complex of the √ñmeriye Mosque dedicated to the memory of the Caliph Omar. The complex reused the earlier 14th-century Augustinian church of St. Mary which was damaged in the Ottoman siege. The hammam was restored in 2002-2004 as part of the Lefkosia Master Plan and is still in use today as a bathhouse and spa. History of √ñmeriye Hamam The site's history dates back to the 14th century, when it stood as an Augustinian church of St. Mary. Stone-built, with small domes, it is chronologically placed at around the time of Frankish and Venetian rule, approximately the same time that the city acquired its Venetian Walls. In 1571, Mustapha Pasha converted the church into a mosque, believing that this particular spot is where the prophet Omer rested during his visit to Nicosia. Most of the original building was destroyed by Ottoman artillery, although the door of the main entrance still belongs to the 14th century Lusignan building, whilst remains of a later Renaissance phase can be seen at the north-eastern side of the monument. In 2003, the [EU] funded a bi-communal UNDP/UNOPS project, \\"Partnership for the Future\\", in collaboration with Nicosia Municipality and Nicosia Master Plan, to restore the Omerye Bath. Spa and wellness The hamam is still in use today and after its recent restoration project, it has become a favourite place for relaxation in Nicosia. In 2006 it received the Europa Nostra prize for the Conservation of Architectural Heritage.

She is the eldest daughter of King Mswati III of Eswatini, and is the country's current Minister of Information and Communication Technology. Early life and education Umhlanga, 2006. She wears a red feather crown, distinguishing her as a royal female. Sikhanyiso Dlamini was educated in Britain at a mixed private school, St Edmund's College, Ware, in Hertfordshire, where she was in Challoner House. She continued to study drama at Biola University in California. In 2012, Princess Sikhanyiso graduated from the University of Sydney with a master's degree in digital communication. While in Australia, she resided in Glebe with her palace-appointed aide, Yemma Sholo. She is the first child of Inkhosikati LaMbikiza and has more than two hundred blood-related uncles and aunts through her grandfather, King Sobhuza II, who had seventy wives and two hundred and one children. She is also one of his one thousand grandchildren in the Royal Swazi House of Dlamini. She is the first-born of thirty children born to King Mswati III, her mother being Mswati III's young love, Inkhosikati LaMbikiza (Sibonelo Mngomezulu). She has two hundred aunts and uncles, not including their spouses. In 2001, Mswati III instituted the umchwasho‚Äîa traditional chastity rite‚Äîin Swaziland as a means of combating the AIDS epidemic. The princess became a focus of controversy because while she was staying abroad, she was not bound by the strictures of the umchwasho. While studying abroad, Princess Sikhanyiso developed a reputation for ignoring or rebelling against her native country's traditions. Sikhanyiso wears Western-style jeans and miniskirts, something women in Swaziland are banned from doing. Controversies The princess at the Reed Dance Festival in 2006. On 14 December 2003, a report appeared in the Times of Swaziland claiming that Princess Sikhanyiso had gone on a trip to the US and Britain, and that the Swazi government had spent close to E1 million (US$100,000) on her trip. The Prime Minister's office subsequently issued a press statement denying these claims.\\"The Issue of 'E1 Million Spent on Princess Sikhanyiso' and The Issue of 'Building' Royal Palaces\\" (Press statement). Swaziland Prime Minister's office. 26 January 26 2004. At the end of the ban in 2005, Princess Sikhanyiso, then seventeen years old, celebrated with a party involving loud music and alcohol at the Queen mother's residence. As punishment for the princess's disrespect of the royal residence, during which Mswati announced his engagement to a new wife-to-be, an official overseeing traditional affairs beat Princess Sikhanyiso with a stick.Domestic whippings in Swaziland, Aug 2005 - CORPUN ARCHIVE szd00508 The following year, the Princess criticized the institution of polygamy in Eswatini, saying, \\"Polygamy brings all advantages in a relationship to men, and this to me is unfair and evil.\\" The Princess was subsequently \\"gagged\\" by the Royal Palace and the press was not allowed to contact her. She was featured in a 2007 documentary titled Without the King about the monarchy in Eswatini, the disparity between the royals' wealth and the widespread poverty of their subjects, and Eswatini's HIV/AIDS crisis. In late September 2013 she had a three-hour-long Twitter conversation with a proscribed Swazi organisation, the People's United Democratic Movement. Afterwards her Twitter account was deleted without explanation. Achievements The King supported the Princess with her launch of the Imbali Foundation in April 2014. The foundation focuses on the health, education, and spirituality of Imbali YemaSwati (the regiment of Swazi maidens headed by the Inkhosatana or Chief Maiden). The Princess runs the beauty pageant Miss Swaziland Tourism. The Swaziland Deaf Association requested her patronage for Miss Deaf Africa and received the government's support. The Princess is an aspiring actress and rapper and is commonly known as \\"Pashu\\" in Eswatini.Princess Sikhanyiso P. Dlamini - Voice Over TalentPashu - ReverbNation During her brief stay in Malaysia for an internship program at Limkokwing University, she recorded a single titled \\"Hail Your Majesty\\" in honour of her father, The King. The debut of the tribute song received a standing ovation at Limkokwing during the conferment of an honorary doctorate to King Mswati III on 4 July 2013.

Biography With roots in the Midwest, Williams' music career began in Boston, Massachusetts with a self-released EP Songs For the Commute. After one year in Boston, Williams moved to New York and immediately began writing and recording a second release while staying at the Hotel Chelsea. These sessions turned into his two subsequent albums, 8/18 Chelsea Sessions and Tales of Digression, which would soon after become the first two releases on the Dovecote Records label. Williams supported these releases playing small clubs and venues in the US and UK. In 2004 he met London-based producer Dave Lynch during a showcase at the CMJ festival in New York City. Lynch offered to record Williams' next record if he ever found himself in the UK again. In November 2005, Williams moved in with friends in Eastbourne, England and began writing and recording with Lynch. The resulting album (When Work Is Done) marked Williams first release with national exposure. He embarked on multiple tours making stops at South By Southwest, CMJ, and the Sundance Film Festival. His video for \\"Novel\\" won MTV's weekly video contest The Freshman. Williams' third studio album, Careful Love, should be approached with a few more personal facts in mind: he wrote it after open heart surgery, while in love, and displaced from Brooklyn to California.

Born in Kovel, then in the Russian Empire, now in Ukraine, the youngest of the eight children, she immigrated with her family to New York City in 1910 and became a US citizen in 1916 (in later life, she retained her fluency in Yiddish and continued to pray daily). After graduating from Morris High School (Bronx), she worked as a clerk for New York City law firms to earn tuition for night classes at Brooklyn Law School; there, in 1924, she earned a Bachelor of Laws LL.B (a terminal law degree open to high-school graduates until 1971). She had to reach the minimum age of 21 to be admitted to the New York State Bar Association, but in 1926, at age 22, she became the \\"youngest woman lawyer practicing in New York City.\\" She practiced law in New York until 1946. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman nominated her to be a commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, a position never held before by a woman; she was confirmed by the Senate on July 6. Arguing that \\"television channels represent one of America‚Äôs most valuable resources,\\" Hennock sought to mobilize public support for educational television, writing and speaking widely about the importance of television for education and consulting with the Institute for Education by Radio and the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. In congressional hearings in 1950, educators from the Joint Committee on Educational Television were able to produce studies that countered lobbying from the commercial broadcasting industry arguing that non-commercial stations were unnecessary. When the FCC in March, 1951, published a rule supporting reserving channels for education but not specifying their permanence, Hennock \\"wrote a separate opinion urging that reservations for non-commercial stations should be permanent.\\" That year, President Truman nominated Hennock for a federal judgeship in New York, but opposition caused her to withdraw her name and remain on the FCC; and in April 1952, the FCC's Sixth Report and Order permanently reserved channel assignments in 242 communities for educational stations, thus ensuring the future of public broadcasting in the United States. Paula A. Kerger, the president and CEO of PBS, said in 2016, \\"She was looking at this emerging medium, recognizing that it could be such a democratizing element of society, but that would never fully be realized if there wasn't some piece of it set aside for noncommercial purposes.\\". In May, 1953, Hennock was invited to inaugurate the first educational television station in the country, KUHT in Houston, Texas. When Hennock's FCC term ended in 1955, she returned to legal practice. She married in 1956. She died of a brain tumor in 1960.

In addition to writing the words, he also set the hymn to music, and later arranged it to slower time and published it in Gospel Hymns.\\" Ira D. Sankey arranged the words to the music of \\"The Little Old Log Cabin In The Lane\\" composed by Will Hays. History The lily of the valley is a gospel standard hymn which appeared in almost all protestant hymnals. It was written by Charles W. Fry during one of his performance for the Salvation Army. He and his family were members of the Salvation Army organization owned by William Booth which then was in crisis. It was recorded that Mr. Fry did not like the abuse he saw heralded at the Salvation Army when they established the ministry in 1878 Salisbury, where the Fry family lived and worked as a bricklayer. Mr. Fry and his three sons offered to serve as bodyguards for the Salvation Army workers. It was recorded as witnessed ‚Äúthe next day the four men arrived with their weapons. These weapons consisted of two cornets, a trombone and a small tuba in between fighting off the troublemakers. The fry men played and their music attracted the crowd for the preachers (workers of Salvation Army). This was the first Salvation Army brass band with Mr. Fry as the leader of the band as inscribed on his grave stone. The lily of the valley was coiled from the understanding Mr. Fry received from a meditation on the book of Song of Solomon 2:1 < I am the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valley ‚Ä¶>. He used this verse of the scripture as a focus to relate the message of the preacher William Booth to the people during the protests of 1881. After reading those words of the scripture, Fry wrote about a personal, intimate relationship with Jesus. Those words became the hymn first published in the December 29, 1881, edition of the salvation war national magazine Charles Fry died the year after the publishing of the hymn, on August 24, 1882, in park hall, Polmont, Scotland. Fry had written the words, but no one knew the composer of the music, when the hymn was published in 1885.

It is a peptide which is a fragment of SNAP-25, a substrate of botulinum toxin (Botox). Acetyl hexapeptide-8 is marketed as Argireline by the Barcelona-based research laboratory Lipotec. Overview and common uses Acetyl hexapeptide-3 is used in attempts to decrease the visible effects of aging by reducing the deep wrinkles and lines that occur around the forehead and eyes. Chemically, when applied as a solution to specific areas of the face, acetyl hexapeptide-3 inhibits the reactions that cause muscles to move or contract ‚Äì for example when forming facial expressions such as smiling or frowning. Studies Both in vitro (outside a living organism) and in vivo (using a living organism) tests have been carried out, but no double-blind anti-wrinkle studies are available. In a 2012 double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating treatment of blepharospasm (abnormal contraction or twitch of the eyelid), botulinum toxin injections with subsequent acetyl hexapeptide-3 treatment were compared to botulinum toxin injections with placebo cream treatment. Of the 12 patients in the acetyl hexapeptide-3 group, four experienced an extension of symptom control by 3.3 to 7.1 months. Safety research The 2012 study concluded there were no significant adverse effects. Patients receiving botulinum toxin injections exhibited longer times until return to baseline symptoms when supported with daily application of acetyl hexapeptide-8.

In 2019, all public transport links between the two countries were severed because of Pakistani fury at India's revocation of special status for Kashmir. The only way for travelers to make this journey is to cross on foot at Wagah. Background Trucks on National Highway 1 (India), waiting to cross Wagah Border The partition of India in 1947 led to the termination of most transport links between the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan after the cross-migration of people was completed by the 1950s. The First Kashmir War had similarly divided the Himalayan region of Kashmir between the two rivals, causing termination of road links in the region. Kashmir and the international border in the divided region of Punjab were major theatres of war during the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971. The train connecting the Indian city of Jaipur with the Pakistani city of Karachi across the Thar Desert was destroyed when the Pakistani Air Force bombed the tracks during the 1965 war. In the 1990s, the Line of Control (LoC) demarcating the informal boundary between Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir was the scene of exchanges of fire between Pakistani and Indian forces and infiltration of militants into Indian Kashmir. The Kargil War of 1999 broke out when Indian force sought to repel militants and Pakistani soldiers who had infiltrated across the LoC. By the 1970s it was possible for foreigners with the appropriate visas for each country, such as those traveling the Hippie Trail from Europe to Nepal, to walk across the border, stepping between the guards facing each other across the line. In 1977, both nations launched the Samjhauta Express connecting the Indian city of Attari with the Pakistani city of Lahore. Since the successful launch of the Delhi-Lahore Bus in 1999, both nations have worked to established multiple bus and train services connecting cities across the borders in the Punjab region and Sindh as well as between Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan- administered Kashmir across the Line of Control (LoC)the boundary line denoting rival areas of control in the disputed region of Kashmir, which is not an official international border. India and Pakistan have no official trade relations due to ongoing tensions. Bus service The Delhi-Lahore Bus is a passenger bus service connecting the Indian capital of Delhi with the city of Lahore, Pakistan via the border transit post at Wagah, which is the only border crossing point between India and Pakistan opened for international travelers. The bus was of symbolic importance to the efforts of the governments of both nations to foster peaceful and friendly relations. In its inaugural run on 19 February 1999, the bus carried the then-Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was to attend a summit in Lahore and was received by his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif at Wagah. Its official name is the Sada-e-Sarhad (Urdu for Call of the Frontier). The duration of the entire journey is eight hours, covering a distance of 530 km (329 mi). While the bus service had continued to run during the Kargil War of 1999, it was suspended in the aftermath of the 2001 Indian Parliament attack on 13 December 2001, which the Indian government accused Pakistan of instigating. The bus service was resumed on 16 July 2003 when bilateral relations had improved. This service was suspended in 2019, as a result of Pakistani fury at the revocation of Kashmir's special status. Train services As per the Shimla Agreement of 1972 and in a bid to restore peaceful ties after the Indo- Pakistani War of 1971, both nations launched the Samjhauta Express (Samjhauta means \\"accord\\" or \\"compromise\\" in Hindi and Urdu), connecting the Pakistani city of Lahore with the Indian town of Attari, which is close proximity to the city of Amritsar. The Thar Express was launched to connect the Pakistani city of Karachi through the Khokhrapar station and the Indian city of Jodhpur through the Munabao station. Plans and negotiations are underway to launch a train service connecting the Pakistani city of Sialkot with the Indian city of Jammu. On 18 February 2007, 2 carriages of the train experienced alleged terrorist bombings near Panipat, Haryana in India. The 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings claimed lives of 68 people. Both the Indian and Pakistani governments condemned the attack, and officials on both sides speculated that the perpetrators intended to disrupt improving relations between the two nations, There have been a number of breaks in the investigation of the bombings. As of 2011, nobody has been charged for the crime yet. It has been allegedly linked to Abhinav Bharat, a Hindu fundamentalist group in India. Other allegations also concurred on Lashkar-e-Taiba (a Pakistani-based terrorist organization). A United States report declared Arif Qasmani to be involved in the attack. The Thar Express is the other passenger railway link between the two countries, running from Karachi, Pakistan to Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. It was not discontinued after Partition but was after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. On 18 February 2006, it was revived after a period of 41 years. In 2019, as a result of the revocation of special status for Kashmir, Pakistan's railway minister Sheikh Rasheed decreed that there would be no more rail transport links between India and Pakistan. Transport across Kashmir In 2003, after a ceasefire in Kashmir improved bilateral relations, the two governments worked on the proposal for a bus connecting the city of Srinagar in Indian Kashmir to the city of Muzaffarabad in Pakistani Kashmir. The official agreement was promulgated on 16 February 2005 when the then-Indian Minister of External Affairs K. Natwar Singh visited Pakistani President Pervez Musharaff in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The decision was announced along with agreements on establishing the Thar Express train service. The bus runs a distance of 183 kilometres and was officially launched on 7 April 2005 and was flagged-off by the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. The service was suspended for some time after 2005 Kashmir earthquake due to aftereffect of road damage. A bus service connecting Poonch (India) with Rawalkote (Pakistan) over 55 km was also launched on 20 June 2006. On 5 June 2008 the passenger quota on the Poonch-Rawalkote Bus was doubled. Bus services connecting Kargil (India) with Skardu (Pakistan), Jammu (India) with Sialkot (Pakistan) and Mirpur (Pakistan) are also being planned. The Indian official position viewed the Srinagar- Muzaffarabad bus service as a \\"humanitarian measure without prejudice\\" and not affecting the rival policies and stands of the two governments on the Kashmir conflict. To make the bus safe and fully operational, the LoC would demined if and where necessary and other security arrangements would be made as well. Both governments announced that Indian and Pakistani citizens could travel anywhere in Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir, including the Northern Areas of Pakistan, which are part of India's claim on Kashmir and pre-1947 Kashmir. In India, all citizens would have to apply at the Regional Passport Office in Srinagar, which was the designated authority to evaluate applications, verify identities and issue entry permits. As of 25 September 2019 all transport routes have been closed between India and Pakistan after India revoked the article 370 giving special status to Indian administered Kashmir.

He is chiefly known for his support of conscientious objectors. Life and work His father was a Calvinist pastor. Following in his father's footsteps, he became a theology student at the University of Utrecht. While there, he was exposed to liberal thinking and Hegelian philosophy for the first time and, in 1909, became a member of the League of Christian Socialists. In 1910, he was appointed pastor of the Reformed Church at Nuenen, near Eindhoven in Brabant where van Gogh's father had been pastor 25 years before. =First anti-war activities= In 1914, de Ligt joined with fellow pastors A. R. de Jong and Truus Kruyt to write \\"The Guilt of the Churches\\", charging that the Christian establishment had been complicit in the events that produced World War I. Afterwards, all of his writings became forbidden literature for the Dutch armed forces. His impassioned sermons in support of conscientious objection resulted in his being banned from those parts of the Netherlands considered to be in the war zone. In 1918 he resigned as pastor declaring that, because of his increasingly universalist approach to religion, he no longer considered himself to be specifically a Christian. =Later activities= In 1918, De Ligt married the Swiss activist Catherina Lydia van Rossem, with whom he had a son. He was imprisoned in 1921 for organizing a general strike to gain the release of Herman Groenendaal, a jailed conscientious objector who had gone on a hunger strike. Later that year, he founded the IAMB (International Anti- Militarism Bureau). As he was becoming more involved with the work of the League of Nations, in 1925 he moved to Geneva, where he remained for the rest of his life. However, De Ligt became sceptical about the League's efforts, viewing it as how the colonial powers maintained an unjust world order. De Ligt instead regarded the Brussels Congress Against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism, held in 1927 as more representative of the world's population. At a meeting of the War Resisters International in 1934, he presented his now- famous \\"Plan of a Campaign Against All Wars and Preparation for War\\". (The full text of which may be found in The Conquest of Violence.) De Ligt also took a firm stand against fascism and Nazism in the 1930s. During the 1930s, De Ligt also promoted the ideas of Simone Weil. De Ligt's ideas were especially influential in Britain; they strongly influenced the British No More War Movement. Writing in the pacifist magazine Peace News, playwright R. H. Ward praised De Ligt as \\"the Gandhi of the West\\". De Ligt's last work was a biography of Desiderius Erasmus, whom Van Den Dungen argues De Ligt strongly identified with: \\"He recognized in Erasmus a kindred spirit who.. had fought,..not only against war and violence, but also for the idea of free thought and for the liberation of humanity\\". In 1938, after a brief illness, he collapsed from exhaustion and died at the railway station in Nantes.  The Conquest of Violence  The Conquest of Violence : an Essay on War and Revolution is a book written by De Ligt which deals with non-violent resistance in part inspired by the ideas of Gandhi. The Conquest of Violence drew on British philosopher Gerald Heard's idea that human aggression had become \\"a useless evil\\" with the advent of industrialized warfare. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that The Conquest of Violence \\"was read widely by British and American pacifists during the 1930s and led many of them to adopt an anarchistic point of view\\".

The senior line of the Maynard family was seated at Sherford in the parish of Brixton in Devon. His name appears in the matriculation register of Exeter College, Oxford, under date 26 April 1621, which clashes unaccountably with the date of his admission to the degree of BA on 25 April 1621, given in the University Register of Degrees. Barrister In 1619 he entered the Middle Temple; he was called to the Bar in November 1626, and was elected a bencher in 1648. A pupil of William Noy, afterwards attorney-general, a Devonian, and born in the law, he rapidly acquired a large practice, both on the Western circuit and at Westminster; he argued a reported case in the King's Bench in 1628 and was appointed Recorder of Plymouth in August 1640. Parliamentarian He represented Totnes in both the Short Parliament of 1640 and the Long Parliament, and from the first took an active part in the business of the house. In December 1640 he was placed on the committee of scrutiny into the conduct of lords-lieutenant of counties, and on that for the discovery of the \\"prime promoters\\" of the new \\"canons ecclesiastical\\" passed in the recent irregular session of convocation. He was also one of the framers of the articles upon which Strafford was impeached, and one of the principal speakers at the trial. He threw himself with great zeal into the affair, and on the passing of the bill of attainder said joyfully to Sir John Bramston, \\"Now we have done our work. If we could not have effected this we could have done nothing\\".Brampston, p.75 A strong Presbyterian, he subscribed and administered to the house the protestation of 3 May 1641 in defence of the Protestant religion, and drafted the bill making subscription thereto obligatory on all subjects. In the committee, which sat at Guildhall after the adjournment of the House of Commons which followed the king's attempt to arrest the five members (4 January 1641/2), he made an eloquent speech in defence of parliamentary privilege. In the following May he accepted a deputy-lieutenancy of militia under the parliament, and on 12 June 1643 was nominated a member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines.Westminster Assembly Project accessed 20 June 2008 He took the covenant on 25 September following, and was one of the managers of the impeachment of William Laud in January‚ÄìMarch 1643/4. With his friend Bulstrode Whitelocke, Maynard attended, by Essex's invitation, a meeting of the anti-Cromwellian faction, held at Essex House in December 1644, to discuss the expediency of taking public action against Cromwell as an 'incendiary.' The idea, which seems to have originated with the Lord Chancellor of Scotland Loudon, met with no favour from the English lawyers, and was in consequence abandoned. A curious testimony to Maynard's reputation at this time is afforded by a grant made in his favour by parliament in October 1645 of the books and manuscripts of the late Lord Chief Justice Bankes, with liberty to seize them wherever he might find them. In the House of Commons he was heard with the profoundest respect, while he advocated the abolition of feudal wardships and other salutary legal reforms. He also prospered mightily in his profession, making in the course of the summer circuit of 1647 the unprecedentedly large sum of ¬£700. As a politician he was a strict constitutionalist, protested against the first steps taken towards the deposition of the king, and on the adoption of that policy withdrew from the house as no longer a lawful assembly (November 1648). State trials under the Commonwealth Sir John Maynard. Nevertheless, on the establishment of the Commonwealth he did not scruple to take the engagement, and held a government brief at the trial of Major Faulconer for perjury in May 1653. Assigned by order of court to advise John Lilburne on his second trial in July 1653, Maynard at first feigned sickness. A repetition of the order, however, elicited from him some exceptions to the indictment which confounded the court and secured Lilburne's acquittal by the jury. The jury were afterwards interrogated by the council of state as to the grounds of their verdict, but refused to disclose them, and Maynard thus escaped censure, and on 9 February 1653/4 was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law. In the following year his professional duty brought him into temporary collision with the government. One Cony, a city merchant, had been arrested by order of the council of state for non-payment of taxes, and Maynard, with Serjeants Thomas Twysden and Wadham Wyndham, moved on his behalf in the upper bench for a habeas corpus. Their argument on the return, 18 May 1655, amounted in effect to a direct attack on the government as a usurpation, and all three were forthwith, by order of Cromwell, committed to the Tower of London; they were released on making submission (25 May). Continuing political preferment Maynard was among the commissioners appointed to collect the quota of the Spanish war tax of 1657 payable by Devon. Thomas Carlyle is in error in stating that he was a member of Cromwell's House of Lords. He sat in the House of Commons for Plymouth during the Second Protectorate Parliament, and on the debates on the designation to be given to the 'other' house argued strongly for the revival of the old name (4 February 1657/8). Burnet states, and it is extremely probable, that he was also in favour of the revival of monarchy. On 1 May 1658 he was appointed Protector's serjeant, in which capacity he followed the Protector's bier on the ensuing 23 November. On the accession of Richard Cromwell he was made solicitor-general, and in parliament, where he sat for Newtown, Isle of Wight, lent the whole weight of his authority as a constitutional lawyer to prop up the Protector's tottering government. Education Maynard was involved in the founding of a school for girl's in Exeter when in 1658 he helped to found The Maynard School and Hele's SchoolPlympton St. Maurice History accessed 22 June 2008 in the same year and he was also involved with the Grammar school at Totnes which like Maynard was endowed with funds under the will of Elizeeus Hele Esq who left considerable property for charitable purposes (Maynard was one of the trustees of his will).Lewis, p. 327 The will was the subject of a court case held before Sir Edward Rhodes. In this case the Captain Edmond Lister petitioned parliament on behalf of his wife Joanne. The basis of the petition was that all the money had been left to charity although at the time the will was written Joanne was not born. Rhodes found that any monies left over from the charitable purposes should be given to Joanne Lister although the chaitiable purposes should continue.'House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 6 June 1657', Journal of the House of Commons: volume 7: 1651‚Äì1660 (1802), pp. 548‚Äì549. url. Date accessed: 22 June 2008. The Restoration On Richard's abdication and the resuscitation of the Rump Parliament, Maynard took no part in parliamentary business until 21 February 1659/60, when he was placed on the committee for drafting the bill to constitute the new council of state. He reported the bill the same day, and was himself voted a member of the council on the 23rd. He sat for Bere Alston, Devon, in the Convention Parliament, was one of the first Serjeants called at the Restoration (22 June 1660), and soon afterwards (9 November) was advanced to the rank of king's serjeant and knighted (16 November). With his brother-serjeant, Sir John Glynne, he rode in the coronation procession, on 23 April 1661, behind the attorney and solicitor- general, much to the disgust of Samuel Pepys, who regarded him as a turncoat. The reign of Charles II As king's serjeant, Maynard appeared for the crown at some of the state trials with which the new reign was inaugurated, among others that of Sir Henry Vane in Trinity term 1662. He represented Bere Alston in the Pensionary Parliament, 1661‚Äì79, and sat for Plymouth during the rest of Charles II's reign. He was the principal manager of the abortive impeachment of Lord Mordaunt in 1666‚Äì7, and constituted himself counsel for the defence in the proceedings against Lord Clarendon in the following October. He appeared for the House of Lords in the king's bench on the return to Lord Shaftesbury's habeas corpus on 29 June 1677, and sustained its sufficiency on the ground that, though a general warrant for commitment to prison would be invalid if issued by any court but the House of Lords, the king's bench had no jurisdiction to declare it so when issued by that house. In 1678 he made a spirited but ineffectual attempt to secure the conviction of Lord Cornwallis for the brutal murder of a boy in St. James's Park. The severe censure which Lord Campbell passed upon him for his conduct of this case is based upon an entire misapprehension of the facts. In the debate on Lord Danby's impeachment (December 1678) Maynard showed a regrettable disposition to strain the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edward III) to his disadvantage, maintaining that its scope might be enlarged by retrospective legislation, which caused Swift to denounce him, in a note to Burnet's Own Time, as 'a knave or a fool for all his law.' On constitutional questions he steered as a rule a wary and somewhat ambiguous course, professing equal solicitude for the royal prerogative and the power and privileges of parliament, acknowledging the existence of a dispensing power, without either defining its limits or admitting that it had none (10 February 1672/3), at one time resisting the king's attempts to adjourn parliament by message from the Speaker's chair (February 1677/8), and at another counselling acquiescence in his arbitrary rejection of a duly elected speaker (10‚Äì11 March 1678/1679). Maynard opened the case against Edward Colman on 27 November 1678, and took part in most of the prosecutions arising out of the supposed popish plot, including the impeachment of Lord Stafford, in December 1680. Lord Campbell's interesting story of his slipping away to circuit without leave during the debate on the Exclusion Bill in the preceding November, 'upon which his son was instructed to inform him that if he did not return forthwith he should be sent for in custody, he being treated thus tenderly in respect of his having been long the Father of the House' is a sheer fabrication. Maynard favoured the impeachment of Edward Fitzharris, declared its rejection by the House of Lords a breach of privilege (26 March 1681), and took part in the subsequent prosecution in the king's bench. In the action for false imprisonment during his mayoralty brought by Sir William Pritchard against the ex-sheriff Thomas Papillon on 6 November 1684, an incident in the conflict after the court took on the liberties of the City of London, Maynard conducted the defence with eminent skill and zeal, though a Jeffreys-ridden jury found a verdict for the plaintiff with ¬£10,000 damages. Summoned to give evidence on behalf of Oates on his trial for perjury in May 1685, and questioned concerning the impeachment of Lord Stafford, Maynard pleaded total inability to swear to his memory in regard to that matter, and was dismissed by Jeffreys with a sneer at his supposed failing powers. The reign of James II During the reign of James II Maynard represented Bere Alston in parliament. He opposed so much of the abortive bill for the preservation of the king's person as proposed to make it high treason to assert by word of mouth the legitimacy of the Duke of Monmouth (June), and likewise the extraordinary supply for the creation of a standing army demanded by the king after the suppression of the western rebellion. Though not, it would seem, a privy councillor, he was summoned to the council held to establish the birth of the Prince of Wales on 22 October 1688, and also to the meeting of the lords spiritual and temporal held on 22 December, to confer on the emergency presented by the flight of the king, and as doyen of the bar was presented to the Prince of Orange on his arrival in London. William congratulated him on having outlived so many rivals; Maynard replied : 'And I had like to have outlived the law itself had not your highness come over.' The reign of William III > We are at the moment out of the beaten path. If therefore we are determined > to move only in that path, we cannot move at all. A man in a revolution > resolving to do nothing which is not strictly according to established form > resembles a man who has lost himself in the wilderness, and who stands > crying \\"Where is the king's highway? I will walk nowhere but on the king's > highway.\\" In a wilderness a man should take the track which will carry him > home. In a revolution we must have recourse to the highest law, the safety > of the state. Maynard In the convention which met on 22 January 1688/9, Maynard sat for Plymouth, and in the debate of the 28th on the state of the nation, and the conference with the lords which followed on 2 February, argued that James had vacated the throne by his Roman Catholicism, and attempted subversion of the constitution, and that as during his life he could have no heir, the choice lay between an alteration of the succession and a regency of indefinite duration. He supported the bill for declaring the convention a parliament on the very frank ground that a dissolution, owing to the ferment among the clergy, would mean the triumph of the tory party. On 5 March he was sworn lord commissioner of the great seal, jointly with Sir Anthony Keck and Sir William Rawlinson. This office did not exclude him from the House of Commons, and he continued to take an active part in its proceedings. On 16 March he moved for leave to introduce a bill for disarming papists; and while professing perfect confidence in the queen, he energetically opposed the bill for vesting the regency in her during William's absence from the realm, the passing of which into law was closely followed by his retirement or removal from office, his last appearance in court being on 14 May 1690. Reputation So brief a tenure of office at so advanced an age afforded Maynard little or no opportunity for the display of high judicial powers. As to his merits, however, all parties were agreed; the bench, as Thomas Fuller quaintly wrote before the Restoration, seeming \\"sick with long longing for his sitting thereon\\". Roger North admits that he was \\"the best old book lawyer of his time\\". Clarendon speaks of his \\"eminent parts\\", \\"great learning\\", and \\"signal reputation\\". Anthony Wood praises his \\"great reading and knowledge in the more profound and perplexed parts of the law\\", and his devotion to \\"his mother the university of Oxon\\". As a politician, his moderation and consistency were generally recognised, though for his part in the impeachments of Strafford and Stafford he was savagely attacked by Roscommon in his Ghost of the late House of Commons (1680‚Äì1). Though hardly eloquent, Maynard was a singularly facile and fluent speaker (Roscommon sneers at \\"his accumulative hackney tongue\\" and could sometimes be crushing in retort. Jeffreys once taxing him in open court with having forgotten his law, he is said to have replied: \\"In that case I must have forgotten a great deal more than your lordship ever knew.\\" He humorously defined advocacy as ars bablativa. To Maynard we owe the unique edition of the reports of Richard de Winchedon, being the Year Books of Edward II, covering substantially the entire reign to Trinity term 1326, together with excerpts from the records of Edward I, London (1678‚Äì9). Gunnersbury Park Gunnersbury House, around 1750 Maynard amassed a large fortune, bought the manor of Gunnersbury, and there in 1663 built from designs by Inigo Jones or his pupil Webb a palace, Gunnersbury House, (afterwards the residence of the Princess Amelia, daughter of George II). He died there on 9 October 1690, his body lying in state until the 25th, when it was interred with great pomp in Ealing Church. Family and posterity Maynard married, firstly, Elizabeth Henley, daughter of Andrew Henley of Taunton, Somerset who had three sons and four daughters. She was buried in Ealing Church on 4 January 1655. He married secondly, Jane Austen, widow of Edward Austen and daughter of Cheney Selhurst of Tenterden. She was buried in Ealing Church in 1668. His third wife was Margaret, widow successively of Sir Thomas Fleming of North Stoneham, Hampshire and Sir Francis Prujean, physician to the king, and daughter of Edward, Lord Gorges. He married fourthly, Mary Vermuyden, widow of Sir Charles Vermuyden, M.D. and daughter of Ambrose Upton, canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. Mary survived Maynard and remarried to Henry Howard, 5th Earl of Suffolk. By his first wife Maynard had sons John, Joseph, and four daughters, Elizabeth, Honora, Johanna, and Martha. His eldest daughter married Sir Duncumbe Colchester of Westbury, Gloucestershire; the second, Edward Nosworthy of Devon; the third, Thomas Legh of Adlington Hall, Cheshire; and the fourth, Sir Edward Gresham, Bt. Maynard survived all his children, except his youngest daughter, and devised his estates in trust for his granddaughters and their issue in tail by a will so obscure that to settle the disputes to which it gave rise a private act of parliament was passed in 1694, notwithstanding which it was made the subject of litigation in 1709. Portraits are in the National Portrait GalleryPortraits of Sir John Maynard (1604-1690) at the National Portrait Gallery, London and at Exeter College, Oxford. One of Maynard's opinions was printed in London's Liberty. For his speeches at Strafford's trial see John Rushworth's Historical Collections. For other of his speeches see William Cobbett's State Trials, Parliamentary History, and Somers Tracts. He must be carefully distinguished from his namesake, Sir John Maynard, K.B. (1592‚Äì1658), with whom he has been confounded by Lord Campbell. ReferencesSources * History of Parliament Online ‚Äì John Maynard *Bramston, Sir John.

Biography  Born in Berlin, Michael Sanderling is the son of the contrabassist Barbara Wagner and the conductor Kurt Sanderling. He received his first cello lessons at age five in Berlin. At age eleven, he became a student of Matthias Pfaender at the Spezialschule f√ºr Musik Berlin. The 17-year-old Sanderling was accepted at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" and studied with Josef Schwab. He took further lessons with William Pleeth, Yo-Yo Ma, Gary Hoffmann and Lynn Harrell. In 1987, he won a 1st prize at the Maria Canals International Music Competition. The same year, after his debut as a soloist, he was engaged as solo cellist of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra where he stayed until 1992. From 1994 to 2006, he was guest solo cellist at the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin). From 1994 to 1998, he was an academic at Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\".

Born in Mooncoin, County Kilkenny, Kelly first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-two when he first linked up with the Kilkenny senior team. He made his senior debut during the delayed 1904 championship. Kelly subsequently became a regular member of the starting team, and won six All-Ireland medals and seven Leinster medals. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Kelly won three Railway Shield medals. At club level he was a three-time championship medallist with Mooncoin, after beginning his career with Ballyduff. Kelly retired from inter-county hurling after the 1913 championship. Playing careerClub= Kelly began his club hurling career with Ballyduff in 1900, before joining Mooncoin the following year. After a number of disappointing campaigns, Mooncoin reached the championship decider in 1906. A 3‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì12 draw with Tullaroan was the result, however, Mooncoin were later awarded the title by the county board. It was Kelly's first championship medal. Tullaroan avenged that defeat the following year, however, Mooncoin bounced back to reach a third successive final in 1908. A 5‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì5 trouncing of Threecastles gave Kelly a second championship medal. Mooncoin failed to retain their title once again, and it was 1913 before Kelly lined out in another championship decider. A 5‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of Tullaroan gave him a third and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Beginnings Kelly made his debut with the Kilkenny senior team during the 1904 championship. It was a successful campaign as Kilkenny recorded a 2‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Dublin in the provincial decider. It was Kilkenny's first Leinster medal. Early successes In 1905 Kelly won a second successive Leinster medal as Dublin were once again bested by 2‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì2. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 14 April 1907 saw Cork provide the opposition. The game was a high-scoring affair with Cork winning by 5‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì13. The game, however, had to be replayed as Cork goalkeeper Daniel McCarthy was a British army reservist and Kilkenny's Matt Gargan had earlier played with Waterford in the Munster championship. The replay was another high-scoring one, with Kelly scoring 5‚Äì2 for Kilkenny. A puck-out by Cork's Jamesy Kelleher is said to have bounced and hopped over the Kilkenny crossbar. Kilkenny won the game by 7‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì9, with all seven of their goals coming in a thirty-minute spell. It was Kelly's first All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny lost their provincial crown to Dublin in 1906 as the Tullaroan players withdrew from the team in a dispute over the selection policy, however, the team returned in 1907 with Kelly capturing a third Leinster medal following a 4‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Dublin. On 21 June 1908 Kilkenny faced Cork in the All-Ireland decider for the third time in four years. A high-scoring, but close, game developed between these two great rivals once again. As the game entered the final stage there was little to separate the two sides. Kelly scored three first-half goals while Jack Anthony scored Kilkenny's winning point at the death. Cork went on two late goal hunts, however, the final score of 3‚Äì12 to 4‚Äì8 gave Kilkenny the win. It was Kelly's second All-Ireland medal. The game became the benchmark by which all subsequent All-Ireland performances were judged. Kilkenny surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland titles in 1908 by refusing to take part in the competition, however, the team returned in 1909. A 5‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì7 trouncing of Laois gave Kelly a fourth Leinster medal. The All-Ireland decider on 12 December 1909 pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary, a team that had never lost an All-Ireland final. Before the game itself there was internal fighting within the Kilkenny camp and a selection row left the team short of substitutes. In spite of this, the team still went on to win the game, courtesy of three goals by Bill Hennerby and a fourth by Kelly. The 4‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì12 victory gave Kelly a third All-Ireland medal. Three-in-a-row It would be another two years before Kelly won his fifth Leinster medal. The 4‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì1 defeat of Dublin allowed \\"the Cats\\" to advance to the All-Ireland series once again. Limerick provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 18 February 1912, however, the pitch at the Cork Athletic Grounds was water-logged and the game was refixed for Thurles on 12 May 1912. Limerick were unable to attend the replay and Kelly's fourth All-Ireland title was awarded to him rather than being won on the field of play. Kilkenny later defeated Tipperary in an alternative to the final, however, Limerick later defeated Kilkenny in a challenge game. Kelly won a sixth Leinster medal in 1912 following a 6‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì4 defeat of Laois. Yet another All-Ireland final appearance beckoned, with Cork providing the opposition on 17 November 1912. The game was an extremely close affair with Sim Walton proving himself to be the goal-scoring hero. A speculative Matt Gargan shot also hopped past the goalkeeper to give Kilkenny a narrow 2‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì3 victory. It was Kelly's fifth All-Ireland medal. In 1913 Kelly won his seventh Leinster title in nine years following a 7‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì1 victory in a replay against Dublin. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 November 1913 saw Kilkenny square up to Tipperary for the second time in five years in the first fifteen-a-side All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny led by 1‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì1 at half-time and eventually hung on to win on a score line of 2‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì2. This victory gave Kelly an impressive sixth All-Ireland medal.

Life She was born in Paris, played and composed for the harpsichord and the piano, and lived in Passy. About 1767, Luigi Boccherini composed in Paris the Six Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin op 5. The set was dedicated to Anne Louise Boyvin : \\"She is one of the greatest lady-players on the harpsichord in Europe. This lady (...) plays the most difficult pieces with great precision, taste and feeling (...). She likewise composes, and she was so obliging as to play several of her own pieces both on the harpsichord and pianoforte accompanied with the violin by M. Pagin, who is reckoned in France the best scholar of Tartini ever made.\\" This remark about her performing on the pianoforte is interesting: At the time Boccherini wrote his Six Sonatas op 5, the pianoforte was still a relatively new instrument, but Anne Louise Brillon de Jouy inspired him to write the keyboard part specifically for the new instrument, including dynamic markings. When the sonatas were published in 1769, the reference to the pianoforte was replaced by \\"harpsichord\\" and many dynamic markings were removed because the harpsichord was still the dominant keyboard instrument, and the publisher had to adapt the sonatas for commercial reasons. In 1777, she composed the Marche des insurgents (March of the Insurgents) to celebrate an American victory in the American Revolutionary War. She became a friend of Benjamin Franklin, with whom she had a large correspondence having become acquainted with him during and after his stay in her home city during the American Revolution. She died at Villers-sur-Mer, Calvados, aged 79. In popular culture Madame Brillon appears in the 1939 children's book Ben and Me by Robert Lawson, and is the subject of an elaborate, humorous full page illustration, but does not appear in the 1953 animated short film adaptation.

Playing careerClub= Hoyne joined the Tullaroan senior team at the turn of the century and, in 1901, he lined out in his first championship decider. A high- scoring 5‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì7 defeat of Threecastles gave him his first championship medal. In 1902 Tullaroan reached yet another final.

Kilkenny had yet to win the All-Ireland, however, they looked set for victory by taking a 2-4 to 1-1 half-time lead. Two Limerick goals early in the second-half changed the complexion of the game. Kilkenny failed to score in the second-half as Limerick went on to win by 3-4 to 2-4. In 1898 Lalor lined out in his first provincial decider. A 4-12 to 3-2 trouncing of Dublin gave Lalor his second Leinster title, his first on the field of play. This victory allowed Kilkenny advance to an All-Ireland final meeting with Tipperary on 25 March 1900. Kilkenny dominated the first twenty-three minutes, however, Tipperary then took command. In the second-half Mikey Maher scored a hat-trick of goals while Bill Devane scored a remarkable point, kicking the sliotar over off the top of the goalpost. At the long whistle Tipperary had recorded a 7-13 to 3-10 victory, as Lalor ended up on the losing side once again.

The 'home' All-Ireland final on 16 July 1905 pitted Kilkenny against Cork. In a disappointing contest Lalor's side were heavily defeated by 8-9 to 0-8. Lalor added a fourth Leinster medal to his collection in 1904, as Dublin were narrowly defeated by 2-8 to 2-6. Cork provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider on 24 June 1906, the start of which was delayed by half an hour due to a heavy downpour.

However, 3 reached Cyclone strength. SystemsExtremely Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 01 (01B)= On May 13, a near-equatorial trough developed. The poorly organized system slowly tracked towards the north-northwest. The following day, deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 01B. Favorable upper-level conditions and good outflow allowed the storm to intensify. Shortly after, the cyclone attained tropical storm-force winds and turned towards the northeast. While gradually increasing in forward motion, the storm continued to strengthen. On May 17, the cyclone attained winds of 120 km/h (75 km/h), equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. By May 18 an eye developed and the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (135 mph) before making landfall near Chittagong. After landfall, the storm rapidly tracked northeastward inland and dissipated early on May 20. It caused significant damage and 67 fatalities. =Deep Depression BOB 02Deep Depression BOB 03Deep Depression BOB 04Deep Depression BOB 05Depression BOB 06Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 07 (02B)= On September 19, a tropical depression formed from an area of disturbed weather in the western Bay of Bengal. It drifted northwestward towards the Indian coastline, but a mid- latitude trough pulled it northeastward, The depression strengthened to a tropical storm on the 24th, and it reached cyclone strength while paralleling the Indian coastline on 26th. It made landfall in Bangladesh on the 27th, and dissipated shortly thereafter. Tropical Cyclone 2B was responsible for 51 fatalities and left an additional 137 people missing. =Deep Depression ARB 01 (04A)= On November 2 a tropical depression developed into a tropical depression over Sri Lanka. It drifted southward, northward, then westward over India. On the 10th, it was upgraded to a tropical storm over the Arabian Sea, and it reached its peak of winds the next day. Wind shear caused the storm to dissipate over the open waters on the 14th. =Cyclonic Storm Linda (BOB 08)= Typhoon Linda killed 30 while crossing the Malay Peninsula, emerged into the Bay of Bengal on November 4. It continued westward, reaching cyclone strength again, but vertical shear caused it to dissipate on the 9th. In southern Thailand, 30 people were killed and 102 others were listed as missing as a result of the storm. Linda damaged at least 100 homes and sank 30 ships in the region. An estimated 6,400,000 m2 of farmland were destroyed by Linda. =Tropical Cyclone 03A= A broad trough of low pressure formed into a tropical depression on November 4 in the central Arabian Sea. It moved westward, slowly intensifying into a tropical storm on the 8th. Vertical shear weakened it to a depression later that day, but on the 9th, just before making landfall on eastern Somalia, it restrengthened to a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Three dissipated on the 10th without causing any reported damage.

He lives in Issigeac, France. He holds the record for the most expensive work sold by a living French artist. Biography Raysse was born in a ceramicist family in Vallauris and began to paint and write poetry at age 12. After studying and practising athleticism at a high level, he began to accumulate rubbish odds and ends that he preserved under plexiglas. In 1958, he exhibited some of his paintings with Jean Cocteau at Galerie Longchamp. Fascinated by the beauty of plastic, he plundered low-costs shops with plastic items and developed what became his \\"vision hygiene\\" concept; a vision that showcases consumer society. This work received attention and critical praise in 1961, and at a commercial gallery in Milan, his exhibition sold out 15 minutes before the opening. Raysse then traveled to the United States to get involved with the pop art scene in New York City. Nouveaux R√©alistes activity In October 1960, Raysse, together with Arman, Yves Klein, Fran√ßois Dufr√™ne, Raymond Hains, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely, Jacques Villegl√© and the art critic and philosopher Pierre Restany founded the group Nouveaux R√©alistes. The group was later joined by C√©sar, Mimmo Rotella, Niki de Saint Phalle and Christo. This group of artists defined themselves as bearing in common a \\"new perspective approaches of reality\\". Their work was an attempt at reassessing the concept of art and the artist in the context of a 20th-century consumer society by reasserting the humanistic ideals in the face of industrial expansion. Later life In 2011 Raysse's painting, Last Year in Capri (Exotic Title), sold for $6.58 million at Christie's auction, the most expensive price paid for a work by a living French artist. The sale coincided with a resurgence in interest among collectors for Raysse's work. Attention to Raysse had waned after he moved into classicist painting in the 1960s while abstraction was peaking. The 1993 purchase of his work and commissions by billionaire Fran√ßois Pinault drew more attention to Raysse. Film Raysse acted in Jean-Pierre Pr√©vost's 1971 film Jupiter.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228476/ He then wrote and directed the 1972 film Le grand d√©part.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068656/fullcredits#cast * Par la juste mesure dans le double monde, 1985, video art documentary by Maurice Benayoun about the installation with the same title exhibited during the last Biennale de Paris.

R. (July 2004) \\"Social Savings as a Measure of the Contribution of a New Technology to Economic Growth\\". Working Paper 06/04, Department of Economic History, London School of Economics. Developed in 1950 by American economic historian and scientist Robert Fogel, explains the methodology works to estimate the cost-savings of the new technology compared with the next best alternative. The first oral presentation was at the 1960 Purdue Cliometrics meeting, and the first published version was in the Journal of economic history in 1962. A recent survey can be found in \\"economic and history: surveys in Cliometrics\\", edited by David Greasley and Les Oxley and published by Wiley-Blackwell in 2011. The relevant chapter is entitled \\"social savings\\" and is by Tim Leunig, London School of Economics. Calculation The amount of social savings (SS) may be calculated as :SS = (PT0 ‚àí PT1)T1 where PT0 is the price per unit of the alternative technology, PT1 is the price of the technology being evaluated. T1 is the quantity processed by the technology being evaluated. This saving in resource costs may be taken to be equal to the gain in real national income. Two noted social savings applications include social savings analysis on the contribution of the railway to the 19th century economic growth and the impact of information technology to the 20th century economic growth.  Railroads and American economic growth  Social savings was introduced and applied to the railroads in a seminal book by economic historian and scientist Robert Fogel.Fogel R. (1964) Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History, The Johns Hopkins University Press; 1st Edition. . The social savings analysis involved using quantitative methods to imagine what the U.S. economy would have been like in 1890 if there were no railroads.Railroads and American Economic Growth: Essays in Econometric History  Book Reviews  EH.Net In the absence of railroads, freight transportation by rivers and canals would have been only moderately more expensive along most common routes. Fogel concluded that the difference in cost (or \\"social savings\\") attributable to railroads was negligible - about 2.7% of GNP. This counterfactual history view was vastly different from views proffered by railroad historians and made a controversial name for cliometrics.

He found his greatest success as the tag team partner of Don Jardine wrestling as the second incarnation of The Spoilers in the Tri-State territory. He was one of several men to team with Jardine as Spoiler #2, twice winning the NWA United States Tag Team Championship during the early 1970s. Wolff later formed a tag team with \\"Luscious\\" Larry Heinimi who together were considered one of the top \\"heel\\" tag teams in the Midwest United States during the mid-1970s. Professional wrestling careerEarly career= Trained by wrestler Verne Gagne, Wolff was one of several students to debut during the early 1970s including Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, \\"Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair and Pacific Northwest Wrestling mainstay \\"Playboy\\" Buddy Rose, whom he would become a mentor to during his early career. In one of his earliest matches, he lost to his future brother- in-law Maurice \\"Mad Dog\\" Vachon in Fargo, North Dakota on December 20, 1970. =From Atlanta to Texas= He spent his first years in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling feuding with fellow Minnesota State alumni Ole and Lars Anderson. Wolff dominated his feud with Ole Anderson and, to further the storyline, a real-life incident in which Ole Anderson broke his nose while the two attended college was often referenced by Anderson who frequently claimed that Wolff was trying to end his wrestling career. During mid-1971, Wolff wrestled in the Dallas-area for promoter Jack Adkisson. On July 20, he and Bronko Lubich fought Nick Kozak and Johnny Valentine to a draw at The Sportatorium. Later single matches against Bobby Shane and Johnny Valentine also resulted in draws.

The following year, he faced then WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Pedro Morales at the Westchester Civic Center in White Plains, New York on January 24, 1973. He would be the first of several major opponents to challenge Morales for the title that year. Three days later, substituting for Prof. Toru Tanaka, he faced Chief Jay Strongbow at Sunnyside Gardens in Queens, New York.

While in the Midwest, they were one of the top tag teams in the World Wrestling Association. They also had successful runs in the American Wrestling Association and in the Tri-State territory. For a brief time in the mid-1970s, he and Anderson owned and operated a chain of \\"shirt shacks\\" selling tie-dye shirts. Wolff also traveled to Japan along with Ric Flair, Skandor Akbar and The Outlaws (Dick Murdoch & Dusty Rhodes) and toured with Isao Yoshihara's International Wrestling Enterprise promotion from June 18 to July 15, 1973.

After Anderson lost a retirement match to Billy Robinson forcing him to leave the AWA, Wolff announced he had found a new tag team partner Kim Duk. He and Kim Duk had a brief but memorable run as a tag team, however they were ultimately unsuccessful in winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship and split up soon after. In one of their last appearances as a team, they lost to Greg Gagne & Jim Brunzell at the Omaha Civic Auditorium on August 19, 1975. In October, while in NWA Texas, he scored victories over Red Bastien, Abe Jacobs and Bruiser Blackwell before fighting to a draw against NWA Texas Heavyweight Champion Al Madril in Dallas, Texas on October 28.

While in NWA Florida, he teamed with Superstar Billy Graham and Steve Strong against Rhodes, Jack and Jerry Brisco at North Dade Jr. College in Miami on January 12, 1977. He also defeated Steve Keirn in a tournament final to win the vacant NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship in March before losing it to Dusty Rhodes three months later. The following year, he and Killer Karl Kox feuded with Rhodes and Wahoo McDaniel in Florida Championship Wrestling facing them in several tag team matches. Teaming with Ric Flair and Ox Baker, Wolfe lost to Andr√© the Giant and Dick the Bruiser in a three-on-two handicap match in St. Louis, Missouri on March 17, 1978. =Later career and retirement (1983‚Äì1988)= He defeated Lars Anderson for the WWL Heavyweight Championship in Joplin, Missouri on January 18, 1983. After this point, Wolff began to slow down making brief appearances in various regional territories. He teamed with Ken Timbs against Tojo Yamamoto & Johnny Wilhoit at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee on July 16, 1984. He eventually returned to the AWA where he spent the last years of his career. At the supercard Brawl in St. Paul, Wolff fought Buck Zumhofe to a time limit draw at St. Paul Civic Center in St. Paul, Minnesota on December 25, 1986. The following year at SuperClash II, with Doug Somers & \\"Mr. Magnificent\\" Kevin Kelly, Wolff lost to Ray Stevens and The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels & Marty Jannetty) in a 6-man tag team match at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California on May 2, 1987. Personal life Wolff played football in high school and college, later attending St. Cloud State College, prior to becoming a former defensive end for the Norfolk Neptunes. He was voted Rookie of the Year during his first year in the Continental Football League but left the organization in 1968 to pursue a career in professional wrestling. He was also the husband of Vivian Vachon, a popular French-Canadian female wrestler and member of the famous Vachon wrestling family, to whom he was married from 1976 to 1979. He also had two daughters, Lisa and Ann, from his first marriage. Following his retirement, he eventually moved to Hackensack, Minnesota and formed a company, Banner Saver Pro 2000, which manufactures special custom brackets to keep banners from falling off signs in strong winds. He came up with the idea while watching the 2002 Winter Olympics and saw some of the banners being blown off signs. In 2003, he made a public appearance with the Vachon brothers at the 2003 Cauliflower Alley Club Banquet & Reunion in Las Vegas, Nevada from April 4‚Äì6, 2003. At the event, he gave a speech.

The area is also sometimes called \\"Little New Zealand\\". The town is situated approximately south-east of the district capital Nuwara Eliya. Ambewela is also a service center to the New Galway tea planting district.  Climate and vegetation  Due to the high altitude of the mean annual temperature in the area is below , while frost is common during Winter. Ambewela is also popular for of being the highest (in altitude) and widest grassland in Sri Lanka. Mammals such as the Sambar Deer, Leopard dominate the majority of the forest cover around the area. Ambewela situated en route to the Horton Plains National Park and is famous scenic landscapes, Rhododendron arboreum flowers, and the World's End, which is a deep cliff. Similar to Horton Plains and Ohiya, this site is also one of the Important Bird Areas of Sri Lanka, making the area a popular location for birdwatching as well.  Importance and economic activities  The climatic and economical conditions in Ambewela make it an ideal location for dairy farming, hence the country's only milk powder factory is situated in this area. The two animal husbandries, Ambewela Farm and New Zealand Farm, have Ayrshire cattle and Friesian cows respectively. = Potential for wind energy developments = Cattle at Ambewela Farm. The geographic location and altitude of Ambewela expose the site to strong Southwest Monsoons, with winds occasionally reaching over , making the area a favourable location for wind farms and other wind energy developments. As the site is only used for livestock development and similar activities, the site is also an economical zone for erecting turbines, since cattle usually are not affected by wind turbines. These factors have attracted many local and international developers. In 2003, the area was studied by collaborative effort between the Ceylon Electricity Board and NREL. The study revealed that the wind resource at the site is favourable only during the Southwest Monsoon, which is only a small period per year, and that the Northeast Monsoons does not reach the area due to its extreme altitude. Wind Power system in Ambewela Transportation of equipment such as wind turbines, is also a very significant challenge due to the extreme logistical conditions to access the site. The study revealed that transporting turbines larger than 600KW to the site would be a near-impossible task. The study also revealed that ignoring this issue and constructing wind farms with turbines smaller than 600KW would be extremely uneconomical to the developer.

The cola, which contains natural flavouring and caffeine, was introduced in 2008 in several countries.  Ingredients  Red Bull Cola with glass bottles Red Bull Simply Cola is flavored with plant extracts, including galangal, vanilla, mustard seed, lime, kola nut, cocoa, liquorice, cinnamon, lemon, ginger, coca leaf, orange, corn mint, pine, cardamom, mace, clove, and lemon juice concentrate. It also contains caffeine from coffee beans; at 45 milligrams per 355ml (12-ounce) can, the caffeine level is regulated by the FDA, it contains more than Coca-Cola (34 mg) or Pepsi-Cola (37.5 mg), but less than Diet Coke (47 mg) or Mountain Dew (54 mg). The cola contains significantly less caffeine than Red Bull's eponymous energy drink (80 mg per 250 mL). The drink contains sugar and caramel color and lacks the phosphoric acid and high fructose corn syrup used in some other colas.  Availability and promotions  In 2008, the year of its release, Red Bull Simply Cola was available in Austria, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Croatia, Egypt, Switzerland, Netherlands, Spain, Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, India, Thailand, Romania, Hungary, Russia, Slovakia, New Zealand, Mexico, United Kingdom and the United States. Red Bull Simply Cola is packaged in 250 ml (8.4 fl. oz.) and 355 ml (12 fl. oz.) cans. The larger cans are sold both individually and in 4-packs. Red Bull discontinued distribution of Red Bull Simply Cola in the USA in late July 2011 to focus on the core markets Austria and Germany.  Cocaine claim  In May 2009, food regulators from Germany discovered trace amounts of cocaine from coca leaf extracts in Red Bull Simply Cola, Pepsi One, and Diet Coke. Red Bull GmbH responded by insisting that only de-cocainised coca leaf extracts are used in the production of Red Bull Cola. The amounts in question are minute, around 0.13 micrograms of cocaine in a can of Red Bull Cola, so about 100,000 liters of the cola would need to be consumed for the cocaine to be harmful, according to Bernhard Hoffman, a food scientist for North Rhine-Westphalia who conducted the Red Bull study. Despite this, the drink was ordered off the shelves in the German states of Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Thuringia and Rhineland-Palatinate. After the German Institute for Risk Assessment declared the product safe in a study, the drink was put back on sale from 24 August 2009 onwards. After the news of the German ban, Taiwan confiscated 18,000 cans of Red Bull Energy Drink, but acknowledged the mistake later.

Lockshin (born December 1937 in Columbus, Ohio) is an American cellular biologist known for his work on apoptosis. Academic Background He was educated at Harvard University where, in 1959, he obtained his bachelor's degree. This was followed by doctoral studies at Harvard University under the guidance of Carroll Williams. Lockshin focused mainly on developmental cell death in insects and for which he received his Ph.D. in 1963. In 1964, Lockshin and Williams published their landmark contribution on \\"Programmed Cell Death: Endocrine potentiation of the breakdown of the intersegmental muscles of silkmoths\\", in which they coined the term, programmed cell death, during a time in which little research was being carried out on this topic. Richard Lockshin has made significant contributions to the cell death community. He was one of the founders of the International Cell Death Society and acted as the society's President from 1998 to 2002. Richard Lockshin is a retired Emeritus professor of St. John's University (Jamaica, NY). Lockshin has a twin brother, Michael D. Lockshin, a rheumatologist.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) - the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the northern Indian Ocean as recognized by the World Meteorological Organization - issued warnings for nine tropical cyclones in the region. Storms were also tracked on an unofficial basis by the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center, which observed one additional storm. The basin is split between the Bay of Bengal off the east coast of India and the Arabian Sea off the west coast. During the year, the activity was affected by the monsoon season, with most storms forming in June or after October. The first system originated on May 7 in the Bay of Bengal, which is the body of water east of India; the storm developed in tandem with a storm in the southern hemisphere, and ultimately struck Bangladesh. Three storms formed in June. The first struck Oman and later caused devastating flooding in Yemen, killing 338 people and causing $1.2 billion in damage. The other two storms struck opposite sides of India, collectively resulting in 226 deaths after causing widespread flooding. After a brief land depression in July and a weak depression in early October, the season featured four notable cyclones beginning in late October. A low pressure area moved across southern India, killing 388 people before taking an unusual track in the Arabian Sea. At the end of October, a deep depression killed 14 people in Bangladesh. The strongest cyclone of the season was also the deadliest, killing 1,077 people when it struck Andhra Pradesh in early November. The final storm of the season executed a rare loop in the Bay of Bengal before weakening and striking southern India in early December, killing seven. __TOC__ Season summary ImageSize = width:900 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/2013 till:01/01/2014 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/2013 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1) legend:Depression_=_‚â§51_km/h_(‚â§31_mph) id:DD value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1) legend:Deep_Depression_=_52‚Äì61_km/h_(32‚Äì38_mph) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Cyclonic_Storm_=_62‚Äì87_km/h_(39‚Äì54_mph) id:ST value:rgb(0.80,1,1) legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_88‚Äì119_km/h_(55‚Äì73_mph) id:VS value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_118‚Äì165_km/h_(73‚Äì102_mph) id:ES value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_=_166‚Äì221_km/h_(103‚Äì137_mph) id:SU value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_=_‚â•222_km/h_(‚â•138_mph) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:07/05/2013 till:08/05/2013 color:DD text:\\"BOB 01 (DD)\\" from:11/06/2013 till:12/06/2013 color:TS text:\\"02A (CS)\\" from:12/06/2013 till:16/06/2013 color:TS text:\\"BOB 02 (CS)\\" from:17/06/2013 till:20/06/2013 color:ST text:\\"ARB 01 (SCS)\\" from:26/07/2013 till:28/07/2013 color:TD text:\\"LAND 01 (D)\\" barset:break from:01/10/2013 till:02/10/2013 color:TD text:\\"BOB 03 (D)\\" from:22/10/2013 till:28/10/2013 color:ST text:\\"ARB 02 (SCS)\\" from:27/10/2013 till:29/10/2013 color:DD text:\\"BOB 04 (DD)\\" from:04/11/2013 till:07/11/2013 color:VS text:\\"BOB 05 (VS)\\" from:27/11/2013 till:07/12/2013 color:VS text:\\"BOB 06 (VS)\\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/2013 till:31/05/2013 text:May from:01/06/2013 till:30/06/2013 text:June from:01/07/2013 till:31/07/2013 text:July from:01/08/2013 till:31/08/2013 text:August from:01/09/2013 till:30/09/2013 text:September from:01/10/2013 till:31/10/2013 text:October from:01/11/2013 till:30/11/2013 text:November from:01/12/2013 till:31/12/2013 text:December During the season, the IMD used satellite imagery and surface data to assess and predict storms. The agency also utilized a tropical cyclone forecast model that used climatology and a storm's persistence to forecast future movement. Warnings and advisories were broadcast throughout India by telegraph and news media. The basin's activity is sub-divided between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal on opposite coasts of India, and is generally split before and after the monsoon season. The IMD tracked nine tropical disturbances, including one that developed over land, which is below average of 13 systems. Five of the storms formed from October to December, after the end of the monsoon season. In general, storms moved slower than average, and two of the cyclones took unusual tracks near land - one executed a rare loop in the Bay of Bengal, and another turned abruptly away from the Indian state of Gujarat. According to the JTWC, activity in the basin was 60% greater than average, with eight tropical cyclones. Four of these storms attained hurricane intensity - winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph) - which was a record at the time. During June, a series of storms affected India in the height of the monsoon season. Two storms on opposite sides of the country contributed to the northward progression of the monsoon. Continued rainfall from the monsoon led to additional flooding. As of July 24, flooding from widespread rains had killed 731 people across India. The floods also wrecked 368,420 houses and ruined of crop fields. The monsoon became reestablished over open waters on October 9, spawning two storms in the basin that month. There were two simultaneous storms on opposite sides of India in October, which would not happen again until May 2010. SystemsDeep Depression BOB 01 (01B)= In early May, a westerly wind burst spawned two disturbances on both sides of the equator in the eastern Indian Ocean, in association with the monsoon trough. The system in the southern hemisphere eventually became Tropical Storm Jenna, while the system in the northern hemisphere developed an area of convection about 445 km (275 mi) northwest of Sumatra. This disturbance moved generally northward, and initially remained disorganized; the thunderstorms were removed from the circulation. However, the JTWC issued a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA) on May 5 once the system became better organized amid low wind shear. Rounding the periphery of a ridge, the system turned to the northeast. Based on the appearance on satellite imagery, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 01B at 00:00 UTC on May 7. Three hours later, the IMD classified the system as a depression about 400 km (250 mi) south of Kolkata. The storm intensified further while moving toward southeastern Bangladesh. The JTWC upgraded it to a 75 km/h (45 mph) tropical storm, while the IMD upgraded it to a deep depression. Around 00:00 UTC on May 8, the storm made landfall along Cox's Bazar District. Quickly weakening over land, the system dissipated over northern Myanmar later that day. The system brought rainfall to southeastern India and Bangladesh. Kalapara Upazila in the latter country recorded of precipitation on May 7\\\\. A station in Cox's Bazar recorded peak winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). The storm produced high tides that flooded villages on the coast, while one girl was swept away by high waves. High winds knocked down trees and houses. There were 140 fishermen missing following the storm on 10 boats. =Tropical Storm 02A= On May 31, a weak circulation persisted over the warm waters of the Gulf of Aden. It moved east-northeastward along the coast of Yemen and Oman, bringing dry air from the north which decreased the convection. The system moved farther offshore on June 7 into the open Arabian Sea, where it interacted with the south-west monsoon and developed more convection. The convection became more persistent by June 9 about 1,480 km (920 mi) northeast of Somalia by June 9. Moving northwestward, the system organized enough for the JTWC to classify it as Tropical Cyclone 02A about 160 km (100 mi) from the Oman coastline. This marked the first occasion that a tropical cyclone originated from a system in the Gulf of Aden. Later on June 11, it struck Oman's southeast coast. The storm weakened over land, dissipating on June 12, although it continued to produce rainfall - heavy at times - over the next few days. The IMD did not track the system. Offshore Oman, the storm's rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat, killing one person in the latter incident. Striking Oman, the storm produced significant rainfall totals well above the monthly average, peaking at in the Dhofar region. Strong winds where the storm moved ashore damaged buildings and the local water plant. The rains washed out roads and isolated villages, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. However, the effects were more severe in Yemen, where the floods were considered the worst on record. The storm produced the heaviest rainfall in 70 years, reaching in Ma'rib. Flood waters washed away or damaged of roads and 21 bridges, some of them dating back 2,000 years to the Roman era. The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked of crop fields, accounting for US$100 million in agriculture damage. At least 1,820 houses were destroyed, many of them built on wadis, or dry river beds. Overall damage was estimated at US$1.2 billion, and there were 338 deaths in Yemen. The World Bank assisted in a project to rebuild the damaged infrastructure in Yemen and to mitigate against future floods. =Cyclonic Storm BOB 02 (03B)= On June 9, a disturbance began forming within the monsoon trough off the southeast coast of India. Inflow from the south helped the system organize, and the convection became more defined on June 11\\\\. At 06:00 UTC the next day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 03B, and three hours later the IMD classified it as a depression. A ridge to the east initially steered the system to the northwest, although an approaching trough turned it to the northeast, parallel to the coastline. Early on June 13, the JTWC assessed peak 1-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), and on the next day, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm. Both the intensity and the track were unusual for the month of June. At 00:00 UTC on June 16, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), around which time the storm turned back to the northwest. Five hours later, the storm made landfall near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, and it rapidly weakened into a remnant low. The JTWC continued tracking the remnants until June 18 when the system was over Madhya Pradesh. About 3,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in Andhra Pradesh. When the storm struck the state, the highest winds on land were around 55 km/h (35 mph). However, the most severe effects were due to heavy rainfall, in part due to the storm's interaction with the monsoon. Chennai in northeastern Tamil Nadu recorded on June 14, breaking the 100 year old record for the greatest June daily rainfall total. Three people died near the city after the rains flooded streets. The highest daily rainfall was in Khammam district in Telangana. Widespread areas in Andhra Pradesh received over of precipitation, locally peaking at , causing flooding that breached reservoirs and damaged 3,833 canals. In Madanapalle, flood waters reached 6 m (20 ft) deep, forcing 1,500 people to leave their homes. The floods also damaged of crop fields, with damage to bananas, coconuts, and mangroves. The storm damaged or destroyed 1,594 homes, leaving over 3,000 families homeless. Overall damage was estimated at RS$820 million (US$23.5 million) in Andhra Pradesh, and there were 68 deaths in the state, mostly due to flash flooding. Elsewhere in India, the storm killed 111 people, including 44 in Tamil Nadu where 18 boats were damaged or missing. In some areas, the rains helped end a drought. After the storm passed, the Andhra Pradesh government provided each family RS$1,000 (US$30) if their house was destroyed, and RS$100,000 (US$3,000) if they lost a family member. =Severe Cyclonic Storm ARB 01 (04A)= While the previous storm was paralleling the east Indian coastline, another disturbance formed off the west coast on June 15, also associated with the monsoon. The new area of convection persisted, developing a distinct circulation by the next day. Early on June 17, a depression developed about 365 km (265 mi) west of Mumbai. At 18:00 UTC that day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 04A, after the wind field became more defined. The system moved to the northeast within the influence of the monsoon, and quickly intensified due to an anticyclone aloft providing favorable conditions. On June 18, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm, and further to a severe cyclonic storm by 18:00 UTC that day. At 23:00 UTC, the storm made landfall on Gujarat near Diu, only the fourth cyclone since 1891 to strike the state in June. An hour later the IMD assessed peak 3-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), based on the appearance of an eye feature. Meanwhile, the JTWC assessed slightly stronger 1-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), equivalent to a minimal hurricane. The storm turned northward and slowly weakened, degenerating into a remnant low over Rajasthan on June 20 before being swept up by an approaching trough. The storm moved ashore with a high storm surge, estimated at in Bharuch. Winds reached 85 km/h (53 mph) in Veraval, while heavy rainfall spread across the region, totaling over in some parts of Gujarat. South of the landfall point, high winds and waves washed 10 boats ashore near Mumbai, forcing the crews to be rescued by helicopters. The storm disrupted wheat production and port operations in western India. In Gujarat, the storm uprooted trees and damaged of crop fields, with 2,113 cattle killed between Gujarat and neighboring Maharashtra to the south. The storm damaged 41,134 houses in the two states, and overall damage was estimated at RS$196 million (US$5.6 million). There were 47 deaths related to the cyclone. =Depression LAND 01= Toward the end of July, a well-defined low pressure area developed in the northwest Bay of Bengal. It moved onshore and developed into a depression over southeastern India near Daltonganj on July 26\\\\. Turning to the west, the system moved through central India, bringing heavy rainfall along its path. The system degenerated into a remnant low on July 28 over Rajasthan, and the next day was absorbed by the monsoon trough. =Depression BOB 03= On October 1, a depression formed in the western Bay of Bengal. Moving westward, it failed to intensify beyond 45 km/h (30 mph). Around 00:00 UTC on October 2, the system made landfall near Ongole, Andhra Pradesh. Later that day the system degenerated into a remnant low over Karnataka state. It turned northward and moved through central India, bringing widespread heavy rainfall along its path. Eventually it turned to the northeast, dissipating over the Himalayas on October 5. In southern India, the storm wrecked houses, while flash flooding swept away people into rivers. At least 22 people were killed in the country. =Severe Cyclonic Storm ARB 02 (05A)= Described by the JTWC as having \\"one of the most unusual tracks in North Indian Ocean cyclone history\\", the storm originated as an area of convection that formed on October 14 in the southern Bay of Bengal. Moving westward, it struck near Chennai on October 17 as a well-defined low pressure area. It crossed southern India and emerged into the Arabian Sea on October 20\\\\. The system developed into a depression on October 22 and quickly intensified while moving northward. By October 24, the cyclone approached hurricane intensity as it developed an eye. The IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), and the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). On October 25, the storm abruptly stalled and weakened offshore Gujarat and progressed southwestward as a minimal storm. It was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by October 28, although its remnants persisted until November 2 when they dissipated east of Somalia. In southern India, the storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused severe flooding in Andhra Pradesh. At least 112 reservoirs or dams were breached, killing 200 people in Prakasam district. The waters ruined about of crop fields and damaged about 53,000 houses, leaving thousands homeless and forcing 100,000 people to leave their homes. The floods killed 388 people in southern India and caused US$128.5 million in damage. The storm later brushed the west coast of India, stranding 50 boats. =Deep Depression BOB 04 (06B)= The monsoon trough produced an area of convection south of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on October 21\\\\. Located south of a ridge, the system moved westward through an area of hostile wind shear, which prevented quick development by displacing the circulation east of the convection. The JTWC issued a TCFA on October 22 once it appeared the shear was decreasing, although the system did not organize initially. After the convection became more defined, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 06B on October 25 in the central Bay of Bengal. An approaching trough from the west weakened the ridge, allowing the storm to turn to the north and later northeast. The IMD classified the system as a depression on October 27, and later that day estimated peak 3-minute winds of 55 km/h (35 mph), making it a deep depression. The JTWC assessed a higher intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph). Accelerating northeastward, the storm made landfall near the border of India and Bangladesh around 18:00 UTC on October 28. Moving through Bangladesh, the system quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low on October 29 over the Indian state of Assam. Ahead of the storm, the government of Bangladesh evacuated about 500,000 people, with the assistance of 32,000 people helping spread word of the storm to coastal villages. Boats were advised to return to port. As the cyclone moved ashore, it produced heavy rains and 80 km/h (50 mph) winds, along with a 3 m (9 ft) storm surge. Heavy rainfall caused disruptions and flooding in Kolkata in eastern India. In Bangladesh, flooding drowned thousands of cattle in Chittagong and damaged of crop fields. The storm wrecked about 15,000 thatch huts across the country. About 400 houses were destroyed in Barisal District, leaving thousands homeless. Three children were killed in Khulna after their house collapsed. At least 14 people were killed and over 2,000 people were injured, with 100 fishermen left missing after their boats were wrecked. Two fishermen seeking shelter were accidentally shot and killed by members of the Bangladesh navy, who thought the fishermen were pirates. =Very Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 05 (07B)= After a tropical depression from the Western Pacific dissipated over Myanmar, another disturbance formed in the extreme eastern Bay of Bengal on November 1\\\\. It moved westward due to a ridge to the north, slowly organizing. On November 4, the IMD classified the system as a depression, although the JTWC had classified it as Tropical Cyclone 07B a day prior. The storm quickly organized and developed a well-defined eye. On November 6, the cyclone struck about 50 km (30 mi) south of Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh at peak intensity. The IMD estimated peak winds of 145 km/h (90 mph), while the JTWC assessed peak winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). Soon after landfall, the cyclone weakened and dissipated by November 7. Ahead of the storm, about 225,000 families evacuated, although many towns lacked proper storm shelters. When the cyclone made landfall, it produced strong winds up to 100 km (60 mi) inland, dropped of rainfall across a 40 km (25 mi) region, and flooded over 250 villages along 60 km (37 mi) portion of the coast. About 70% of the overall damage was in East Godavari district, where two villages were entirely destroyed. The storm destroyed of crops and killed millions of cattle and chicken. Across Andhra Pradesh, the storm damaged 647,554 houses, including over 10,000 that were destroyed. Overall damage totaled RS$21.5 billion (US$602 million), comparable to a cyclone in 1977 that also hit Andhra Pradesh. There were 1,077 confirmed deaths with many others missing, although many of the dead were washed into the sea and were unlikely to be found. After the storm, the government and local Red Cross chapters helped residents recover from the damage, while the World Bank provided money to better prepare Andhra Pradesh for future storms. =Very Severe Cyclonic Storm BOB 06 (08B)= Originating from the monsoon trough, a well-defined circulation persisted on November 26 near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, accompanied by a poorly defined area of convection. It formed in an area of moderate wind shear, allowing the system to slowly organize while moving to the west- northwest. Both the IMD and the JTWC initiated warnings on November 28, the latter classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 08B. On November 29, the storm turned to the north and east, beginning a four-day loop in the central Bay of Bengal; the JTWC noted that it was the longest-lasting loop on record in the body of water. During this time, the system remained weak, never intensifying beyond deep depression status. A strengthening ridge to the north turned the storm back to the west on November 30 into an area of lighter wind shear. On December 2, the system intensified into a cyclonic storm and eventually to a very severe cyclonic storm on the next day, with the IMD estimating peak 3-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The JTWC upgraded the system to the equivalent of a hurricane on December 4, estimating peak 1-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Increased wind shear decoupled the convection from the center; the thunderstorms continued to the west-northwest and struck Andhra Pradesh, while the circulation turned southwestward. Weakening further, the system made landfall on Tamil Nadu between Chennai and Pondicherry around 16:00 UTC on December 6\\\\. It rapidly weakened over land, dissipating the next day. Ahead of the storm, about 200,000 people evacuated the Indian coastline, following the damaging cyclone that struck Andhra Pradesh a month earlier. Officials used buses and trucks to transport residents in nearly 500 villages. Officials warned fishermen not to go out to sea during the storm. To prevent accidents, workers closed roads and shut off power ahead of the storm. Two people died in Andhra Pradesh while the storm was still offshore, one due to a house collapsing and the other due to a fallen tree. Heavy rainfall related to the cyclone killed two people before the system moved ashore. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Winds in Chennai reached 100 km/h (62 mph), strong enough to knock down trees and cause accidents; one motorist was killed by a tree near Madras Municipal Airport. Overall, the storm resulted in seven fatalities.

It was built in 1967 as part of a province-wide upgrade of educational facilities. Unlike typical rural high schools of the time that were designed only to graduate matriculation students, it was envisioned as a multi-disciplinary facility for students of all educational paths. Designed for 900 students, the building has been expanded several times; approximately 680 students now attend. For the 2018-2019 school year, the principal is Andrea Tang and the vice principal is Jennifer Gunion. Early history Grey Highlands Secondary School (GHSS) was built in 1967 as one of the many new school construction projects undertaken by Education Minister Bill Davis in order to modernize and centralize rural elementary and secondary schools. When it opened in September 1968, it became the central high school for students from three smaller district high schools, covering a collection area of 195,000 hectares (750 square miles). Those smaller high schools were converted to elementary schools, which in turn replaced the many one- and two-room school houses that were still in operation until that time. E. Murray Juffs, first principal of GHSSUntil that time, the curriculum and facilities in Ontario's rural high schools were designed solely for academic students destined for post-secondary education. Students needing a level of education necessary for the trades, business or a non-academic career inevitably dropped out of high school. E. Murray Juffs, the first principal of Grey Highlands and the main driving force behind the design of the school, envisioned Grey Highlands as a multi-discipline school encompassing opportunities for education in all streams, from occupational training as a car mechanic or short-order cook, to business office training, to a liberal arts education suitable for university preparation. To this end, the original school incorporated four science laboratories, a greenhouse, six technical shops (auto, machine, carpentry, electrical, general, drafting), a double gymnasium, a smaller gymnasium and weight training room, an auditorium with a full proscenium arch stage, a music room with sound-proofed practice rooms, several typing and business machine labs, two home economic kitchens, a languages lab, a library with study rooms, a quarter-mile (400-metre) cinder track and football field/soccer pitch, and classrooms. In addition to education, student involvement in intramural and varsity sports and other activities was expected. For the first ten years, a spring musical was a major school project under the direction of mathematics teacher Eleanor Juffs that involved most students and staff. In addition to several dozen students who appeared as cast members for productions such as My Fair Lady, Oliver!, Brigadoon, Anything Goes, Camelot, and Annie Get Your Gun, there was a full pit band, the sets were built by carpentry students, special effects were generated by the science department, and other students were in charge of audio, publicity, photography, ticket sales, ushering and backstage direction. Each musical ran for three nights, often playing to almost 3,000 people from the surrounding region. Additions In the 1990s, another wing was built onto the school, raising the capacity from 1,000 to 1,200 students. An elevator was also added to provide wheelchair access to all three stories of the science/classroom wing. In 2006, a new wing was added that contained several new classrooms and computer labs, and renovations were done to the cafetorium and front foyer. Athletic teams The school's sports teams compete against other schools in Grey and Bruce Counties under the umbrella of the Bluewater Athletic Association. The Grey Highlands school teams are called the \\"Lions\\", and the school mascot is also a lion. Peculiarities of a rural high school Due to the large cachement area, approximately 95% of the students travel to and from school via school bus. This large proportion of \\"commuters\\" can be a problem in terms of extra-curricular activities such as team practices and band rehearsals. During its first decade of operation, the school ran \\"late buses\\" twice a week that enabled students to participate in extracurricular activities until 5 pm. However, these were discontinued by the school board as a cost-saving measure, and students were responsible for finding their own way home after late extracurricular activities. However, during the school year of 2018-2019 late buses were brought back running Mondays to Thursdays unless otherwise stated. It is currently unknown if they will be run again during the 2019-2020 school year. The area around Flesherton is in a snow belt region, and winter storms from Lake Huron and Georgian Bay can cause several \\"snow days\\" each year, when buses cannot safely deliver students. While this is not a problem when students are forced to stay home, there is always the question of whether to send students home early when a daytime storm threatens. This problem was not anticipated in the first winter of operation (1968‚Äì69), when a sudden storm stranded the entire student body and staff at the school, forcing them to spend the night in the gymnasium and auditorium. Procedures were developed to try to avoid this, including a barograph in the office of then Head of Science W.J. Brown that would warn of sudden drops in barometric pressure.

She was first portrayed by actress Shirley Anne Field from October 13 to December 28, 1987, and was then replaced by Marj Dusay, who portrayed the role from December 29, 1987, to July 7, 1988.http://santabarbara- online.com/pamela2.htmhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150221053734/http://capridge.com/pamela.htm Dusay returned as a guest star from February 25 to March 4, 1991. Character history Although she was mentioned multiple times during the early years of the series as the first wife of wealthy businessman C.C. Capwell, Pamela was never seen on the show until 1987. Pamela's marriage to C.C. had dissolved shortly after the birth of their son Mason. Pamela spent some years in England, where she fell in love with Michael Conrad and gave birth to Jeffrey Conrad, their son. After her husband's death, Pamela returns to Santa Barbara in secret hiding a disfiguring disease. She is cured by her friend Dr. Alex Nikolas. Having recovered, Pamela tries to win C.C. away from his wife Sophia by revealing that the derange Elena Nikolas actually their daughter. Pamela successfully seduces C.C. who comes to see the affair is a mistake and he returns to Sophia. Pamela later learns that Jeffrey is dating C.C. and Sophia's daughter Kelly and she hires a man to break them up. Pamela pretended to be the dutiful mother-in-law when they married but she desperately plotted the end of the marriage. After some failed business dealings thanks to C.C.'s interference in her newly successful oil company, Pamela blamed C.C. for the death of Hal Clark. However, it was later revealed by Dr. Scott Clark, who had undergone hypnosis, that Pamela had actually been the one who murdered Hal. Fearing that she might be locked up, Pamela tried to kill Kelly, but didn't succeed. She was apprehended by the police and Mason told her that he wanted nothing further to do with her. In 1991, Pamela returned to town supposedly cured of her madness, winning the affection of her son Mason again during a point where he was particularly vulnerable to his mother's love. Pamela was used by him to upset his father and Sophia, given the same dress that Sophia had worn at her third wedding to C.C. to wear to a Capwell family dinner. Memories of her past life were too traumatic for Pamela to handle, and in the middle of the dinner, she began to babble, ultimately trying to strangle the petrified Kelly. Pamela was once again sent to the asylum, but not before revealing that Capwell family friend Cassandra Benedict was really Minx Lockridge's illegitimate daughter.

Nutritional gatekeepers can be a parent, grandparent, sibling, or caregiver. History The concept of the nutritional gatekeeper was first suggested by Kurt Lewin in 1943. Based on Lewin‚Äôs research, food reaches the household through \\"channels\\" such as grocery store, the garden, and the refrigerator. The selection of the channels and the food that passes through them is under control of the gatekeeper.Lewin (p. 37) For sixty-five years since Lewin‚Äôs work, many dietetics and nutrition textbooks have referred, in the discussions of children‚Äôs and adolescents‚Äô dietary habits, to the gatekeeper role played by women.Whitney and Cataldo 1983: Bass et al. 1979: Giffte et al. 1972 Roles Gatekeeper research starting in the 1940s suggests that the cooks are also responsible for nutrition. Cooking family dinners can expand the nutritional gatekeeper's influence. Eating family dinner has been associated with healthful dietary patterns, better fruit and vegetable intake, lower intake of fried food and soda.Richard R Rosenkranz, David A Dzewaltowski (2008) \\"Model of the home food environment pertaining to childhood obesity\\", Nutrition Reviews 66, 123-140.

They are the biggest food influence in the lives of their children as well as in the life of their spouse or partner. They also influence the restaurant orders of their family by what they recommend or order themselves.Safety, Nutrition, and Health in Early Education by Catherine Robertson Greater numbers of children are relying on caregivers to provide a significant portion of their nutritional needs or act as nutritional gatekeepers. Currently, child care in the United States is varied ‚Äì child care homes (both regulated and unregulated) ‚Äì and other placement such as care in the child‚Äôs home by a relative or other caregiver.Nutrition Education + Training Program, School + Community Nutrition, Georgia Department of Education 1997.

Plot Old Jean Basse and his granddaughter Pauline live in poverty-stricken Blind Alley, and they sell miniature statues to make a living. Jean's one ambition in life is to own a high silk hat, and when he comes into a small inheritance, he buys a hat and plans to use the rest of money to help his neighborhood friends. He finds out afterwards that the entire inheritance he is getting consists of nothing but a dusty old painting. Pauline is in love with a young struggling artist who lives in their building, and upon showing him the painting her father has inherited, the young artist proclaims it to be an original Van Dyke, worth a fortune. A famous artist learns of the painting and first tries to cheat Jean out of it by offering him $2.00 for it, then attempts to steal it outright, but he is unsuccessful. Pauline's sweetheart manages to sell several of his paintings and then proposes marriage to her. On the day of the wedding, the young couple present Jean with a brand new silk hat, but they learn the old man is dying.

Life  Bertram was born in Minden. He is first recorded in Hamburg in 1367, and lived there for the rest of his life, becoming a citizen and Master in 1376, and achieving considerable prosperity. In 1390 he made a will in advance of an intended pilgrimage to Rome, but if he made the journey it had no detectable influence on his art. He was married, but his wife had died by his second will in 1410, when he had a surviving daughter. He died in Hamburg.  Works  His most famous surviving work is the large Grabow Altarpiece (or Petri-Altar) in the Kunsthalle Hamburg, the largest and most important North German painting of the period. There is a 45-scene altarpiece of the Apocalypse, probably by his workshop, in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He, or his workshop, also produced sculpture, presumably in wood; in fact in his first years in Hamburg most surviving documentation relates to sculpture, including chandeliers. A sculpture group depicting Saint Christopher by his hand is located in Falsterbo church, Sweden. His style is less emotional than that of his Hamburg near-contemporary Master Francke, but has great charm. Bertram was largely forgotten after the Renaissance until the end of the 19th century when, like Master Francke, he was rediscovered and published by Alfred Lichtwark, director of the Hamburg Kunsthalle.

Meeting with Iraqi Deputy Agriculture Minister, Mehdi Al Qaisi. Greek‚ÄìIraqi relations are foreign relations between Greece and Iraq. Relations of the Greek and Iraqi peoples are deeply rooted in history, both have developed cultures that have influenced the course of humanity. They date as far back as when early Greek scholars of the 1st millennium BC lived and studied in Babylonia and Assyria, to later when Alexander III of Macedon ruled Mesopotamia (which name is of Greek origin, meaning \\"the land between two rivers\\") and would die in Babylon, Iraq. Greece firmly and consistently supports the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. Greece traditionally maintained good and friendly relations with Iraq due to strong historical and cultural bonds, dating back to ancient times. Greece has an embassy in Baghdad, and Iraq is represented by her embassy in Athens. Both nations border Turkey.  History  Modern history = Since 1979, when Saddam Hussein came to power Greek-Iraqi political relations have been good but limited due to Iraq's totalitarian regime. Official agreements signed by Greece and Iraq demonstrate the spirit of solidarity and co-operation by which relations of both countries are marked. For instance, in 1979 Constantinos Karamanlis, who was then Prime Minister of Greece, visited Baghdad; during that visit both sides signed a co- operation agreement on technical and economic issues. Author:George Tzogopoulos, PhD researcher on U.S. foreign policy and the media, Loughborough University. Moreover, during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War there was co-operation in the field of war material. As, in 1985 the Greek company PYRKAL provided Iraq with $77 million worth of munitions and in 1987 the Greek company EBO provided approximately $83 million worth of munitions. After Gulf War I, UN sanctions were imposed on Iraq. Greece supported the oil for food programme as it was interested in the future of the Iraqi people. As a result of its economic embargo Iraq owes high amounts to Greek companies on the basis of their co- operation during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Despite Iraq's international isolation both countries continued their co-operation. Specifically, in 1998 Greece and Iraq signed a scientific and cultural co-operation agreement which included co-operation between Iraqi and Greek universities regarding degree recognition, the granting of scholarships and the teaching of ancient and Modern Greek in Iraq. In addition, in June 1999 the President of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Iraqi Parliament visited Athens, as did the General Director of the Iraqi News Agency, who signed a co-operation agreement with the Athens News Agency. Furthermore, in June 2000, the eighth Meeting of the Mixed Economic Committee of the two countries took place, and upon its conclusion a Text of the Agreed Minutes was signed. To conclude, Iraq and Greece have almost always enjoyed a friendly relationship.  Greece's position in the 2003 invasion of Iraq  Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis's declaration on 21 March 2003 mirrored the official Greek position regarding the invasion, as he declares > :\\"Greece is not participating in the war and will not get entangled in it.\\" In addition, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou expressed Greece's opposition to the United States going it alone in Iraq. Many other political parties condemned the invasion, such as the Communist Party (KKE) and the Greek Left Party-Synaspismos, who saw the war as proof of U.S imperialistic aspirations in the Middle East. Despite opposing the war, Greece did agree with the United States policy of disarming Iraq and destructing any WMD, that Iraq supposedly possessed. However, Greece did not agree with Bush's strategy of pre-emptive war as a means of fighting terrorism. By contrast it was in favor of settling the dispute over Iraq by diplomatic means and not by force. Unlike the opposition to Gulf war II, Greece did participate in the first Gulf war, as a means of restoring peace in the Persian gulf, after Iraq had invaded Kuwait. = Domestic response = Public opinion in Greece was overwhelmingly against the war on Iraq. A poll published on 4 April 2003 showed that 90.7% of Greeks were totally opposed to the intervention in Iraq, while 3.4% were quite opposed to it. Only 1.4% agreed completely with the war and 2.0% agreed to an extent. Many demonstrations took place with people shouting anti-American slogans and marching to the U.S. Embassy in Athens and the U.S. consulate in Thessaloniki. For example, on 14 February 2003 approximately 100,000 people participated in the anti-war demonstration in Athens. In addition, nationwide strikes were called by the two general trade union federations in Greece, namely the GSEE (private sector) and ADEDI (public sector) to protest the war against Iraq. These strikes shut down public services, private companies, schools, universities, shops etc.; in order to give people the chance to express their opposition to the U.S.-led war against Iraq. = Greek media = The Greek media strongly criticized the U.S. and its foreign policy motivations and also condemned U.S. policy towards Iraq. The media saw the oil factor as the reason for war, to reflect the influence of media onto the peoples, a poll organised by Alco showed that 91.5% in 94.5% of Greek young people who watched television, read newspapers and listened to radio during the war believe that the U.S. invaded Iraq for economic reasons while only 2.7% to fight terrorism. According to the same poll 93.2% of young Greek people had a negative image of George W. Bush.

Ababu Namwamba taking the oath of office as Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs before President Mwai Kibaki at Harambee House, Nairobi Ababu Namwamba E.G.H. (full name Ababu Tawfiq Pius Namwamba) is a Kenyan politician and international lawyer trained in Nairobi and Washington, DC. Since 2016 he has been the leader of the Labour Party of Kenya and is currently the Chief Administrative Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya. Biography Ababu Namwamba was born in Jinja, Uganda to Kenyan parents on 23 December 1975, and raised in Uganda and later Kenya. Outside politics he is a public interest attorney specializing in international human rights and constitutional law, and a former columnist with leading newspapers in Kenya. Legal practice Ababu Namwamba holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Nairobi and a Master of Laws degree in International Law from American University Washington College of Law. Before his election to Parliament in 2007 on his first attempt, he had already built an impressive profile as a public interest attorney and crusader for accountable government. He was Chief Counsel at The Chambers of Justice, a public interest trust he founded in 2002 and ran alongside his law firm, Ababu Namwamba Attorneys-at- Law. Namwamba is among pioneers in public interest litigation for the defenseless. In 2004 he won a landmark legal battle in which his client, a Kenyan-born Pakistani, had been wrongfully accused of terrorism. It was the first case of its kind in Kenya. In 2003, he secured a historic ruling in a constitutional case that affirmed the right of children living with HIV/AIDS to attend public schools unfettered. He filed the case for Chambers of Justice and Nyumbani Children's Home after two schools in Ngong‚Äô and Karen barred children from Nyumbani for their HIV status. This case won Namwamba international acclaim, winning him the 2004 Global Justice Award which he received in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He was inducted onto the roll of Young Global Leaders by the World Economic Forum in 2009. As counsel for Swiss national Marianne Brynner, Namwamba was again in the public eye in 2004/5 as he played a central role in the last probe into the mysterious death of former Kenyan Foreign Affairs Minister, the late Dr. Robert Ouko. This was also the period that saw Namwamba active on the international lobbying circuit, strongly advocating for international human rights, fair trade practices and debt relief for Africa through platforms like the World Social Forum in such far flung locations as Mumbai, India and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Locally, he pressed for responsible governance through the unique \\"After the Promise\\" annual governance report card. An avid reader and consummate writer, the Hubert Humphrey Fellow/Fulbright alumnus was also a regular columnist with the Sunday Nation and later Standard on Sunday, Kenya's top two newspapers, where he wrote weekly political analysis for over five years. Community service In 2003, he initiated the Ababu Namwamba Foundation, a charity that supports education, talent growth and economic empowerment for hundreds of young Kenyans. He calls the foundation his ‚Äòpayback‚Äô to Kenya, himself a beneficiary of a Jomo Kenyatta Foundation scholarship in high school. The foundation offers scholarships to bright students from economically challenged backgrounds, runs a mentorship program for students, supports development of sporting talents and works with women and youth groups on income-generating activities. Political career Namwamba was first elected to parliament in the 2007 Kenyan parliamentary election as a member of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), representing Budalang'i Constituency in the National Assembly of Kenya.Members Of The 10th Parliament . Accessed June 19, 2008. He was Parliamentary Secretary of the ODM from 2008 to 2013, and served as Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs from 2012 until the ODM lost office in the 2013 election. In 2016, Namwamba quit ODM where he was serving as Secretary General. He felt that the party leader Raila Odinga (who had stood for the presidency twice) was no longer capable of convincing voters to support him. He joined the newly relaunched Labour Party of Kenya, and since September 2016 he has been the leader of the Labour Party.\\"Ababu Namwamba named Labour Party leader\\", The Standard (Kenya), 22 September 2016. In March 2017 the Labour Party announced that it would support the presidential candidacy of Uhuru Kenyatta in the election of August 2017. Namwamba lost his Budalang'i seat in that election. In January 2018, Namwamba was nominated to the position of Chief Administrative Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was sworn into office in March 2018.

He was portrayed by American actor Frank Runyeon from May 26, 1988 to October 14, 1991. Character history When Mason Capwell was accused of the murder of Mark McCormick, he left Santa Barbara in search of Mark's true killer. Mason's quest led him to a convent where Michael Donnelly was the main priest. An explosion caused Mason to lose his memory and he was presumed dead, but his wife, Julia Wainwright, showed up at the convent searching for the truth about Mason. Eventually the truth about Mark's killer was revealed, but by that time Father Michael realized he had fallen in love with Julia. Michael's profession as a priest came to torment him when he heard the confession of serial rapist Zach Kelton. Michael's conscience was troubled, because he wanted to inform the police but was forbidden to do so by the Seal of the Confessional. Zach, fearing that Michael would betray him, kidnapped Julia. Michael rescued Julia, and came to the conclusion he would need to give up the priesthood. When married couple Laura and Ethan Asher came to town, Michael revealed that he had once had a relationship with Laura and had accidentally killed her child while working as a policeman. Laura forgave Michael, but Ethan was suspicious of Michael and Laura. Another person from Michael's past, Leo Mitchell, arrived in town threatening Michael. When Leo was killed, Michael was accused of committing the crime, but it turned out that Laura had killed Leo in self-defense. Michael then had a short relationship with Greta McAdams before moving on to Nikki Alvarez. Cruz Castillo saved Michael and Nikki from being tormented by Kirk Cranston, and the couple started dating and got engaged, but Nikki was murdered by Harland Richards before the wedding. Michael was then hired by Minx Lockridge to find the daughter she had given up many years before. After learning that Minx's daughter was Cassandra Benedict, Michael and Cassandra dated for a while. After Cassandra, Michael became involved with Flame Beaufort, but her suicidal nature ruined their relationship. After that, Michael decided to leave town to get away from bad memories.

Stanground Academy was finally rebuilt in September 2013 with the original school making way for demolition. This was beneficial in terms of the facilities available to students at the school, and has also solved the many maintenance issues with the former building which had led to the school being closed to students on several occasions in the past due to dangerous conditions for a communal building.Stanground College closed for another day Peterborough Evening Telegraph, 12 February 2009 Facilities at the school include a pool open for public swimming and a fitness suite/gym which is also open to the public during term time as well as in the half term breaks.

The older bridge opened in July 1955 and is a steel through truss cantilever bridge and carries southbound (east on I-82) traffic. Northbound traffic (west on I-82) and pedestrians travel on the newer concrete arch bridge, opened in 1988.  History  Construction = The old bridge was proposed by Umatilla County judge James H. Sturgis and known as \\"Sturgis' folly\\" initially. The construction upstream of McNary Dam would create Lake Wallula and submerge the old Wallula Highway. In the interim, traffic was carried across the newly formed lake via ferry service, with 178,576 vehicles transported in 1951. The bridge was dedicated on July 15, 1955, by the governors of Oregon and Washington. The bridge was financed by $10 million worth of bonds and operated as a toll bridge for 19 years until August 30, 1974, when the bonds were fully repaid. = Rehabilitation = On June 12, 2017, work began on the rehabilitation the older steel truss bridge. The bridge had been found to be structurally deficient by the Washington State Department of Transportation. Two projects were proposed to repair the bridge. The first project involved repairing the bridge deck which involved shifting traffic off of the 1955 bridge onto the 1988 bridge at a cost of $9.5 million. This project is set to be completed in mid-June 2019 and traffic will once again travel on both of the bridges. The second project involves repainting the steel truss structure at an estimated cost of $40 million.  Description  It is a five-span continuous Warren through truss design. The configuration of the span is unusual in the fact that it takes advantage of a submerged island near the middle of the Columbia River. With its two spans, each constructed using the cantilever method, this is the only bridge in the state having two spans constructed using that method.

It forms southwest of Alpine and flows southwest then northwest to meet the White River west of Fort Apache. The merged streams form the Salt River, a major tributary of the Gila River. James Ohio Pattie named the river in 1826 as he explored the area. Course From source to mouth, the river flows through Apache, Greenlee, Graham, Navajo and Gila counties. It forms a boundary between Apache and Greenlee counties, then between Apache and Graham counties, and further downstream, between Graham and Navajo counties. Along its lower reaches, the Black River is the boundary between the Fort Apache Indian Reservation on the north and the San Carlos Indian Reservation on the south. The river also passes near the Bear Wallow Wilderness, through which flows one of the river's tributaries, Bear Wallow Creek. Some of the places along the lower river are difficult to reach. Many of the roads in the area are unpaved and unmarked on major maps. The \\"Black River AZ Map\\" and \\"Lower Black River guide book\\" show more details. Bear encounters are possible along this river. Indian route 9 crosses the river at Black River Crossing. Flora and fauna Rainbow and brown trout and smallmouth bass are among the 13 species of fish found in the Black River. Major fishes in this river system also include channel catfish, desert suckers, and fathead minnows, among others. Anodonta californiensis and Anodonta have been found on the north fork at Crosby Crossing. The East Fork Black River and West Fork Black River, which merge to form the mainstem, have populations of brown trout and Apache trout. The headwaters tributaries support many aquatic insects, including more than 30 species of caddisflies. Some of the state's best sports fisheries are found in the Black River watershed.Benke and Cushing, p. 519 Special permits are required to fish on either reservation. Plants in the riparian zones include several kinds of willows and cottonwoods, as well as alders and saltcedar. Beaver, muskrats, great blue herons, mallards, and osprey are among the vertebrates found in or near the river.

He was a pioneer researcher in several aspects of modern Mexican archaeology. He was born (and died) in Azcapotzalco, Federal District, to a family renowned for its contributions to the humanities and sciences. Education He studied architecture at the National University and started a brilliant career assisting architect Mario Pani during projects as the new National Conservatory and the Latinoamericana Tower, both in Mexico City. However, he soon get interested with archaeologic excavations, due to the rich history of the soil in many areas where he was working as architect. Another element that influenced his first studies as archaeologist, was that during his childhood he spent many days exploring the old ruins of Teotihuacan, years before its reconstruction. Actually, Parey√≥n Moreno's father, colonel Eduardo Parey√≥n Azpeitia, was a friend of Manuel Gamio, whose work and personality had an impact during his first cultural development. He returned to study at the National School of Anthropology, where he completed his master dissertation \\"Excavations at the archaeologic zone of Cerro del Tepalcate\\" (1961). Career From 1955 to 1959 was assistant of Alfonso Caso during excavation and register works in archaeological sites in Quiotepec, Tecomavaca, Los Cues, and Cuicatl√°n, Oaxaca. In 1959 was named director of the Museum of Popular Arts at P√°tzcuaro, Michoac√°n. Around 1960 Pareyon was exploring and mapping archaeological sites in the low basin of the Balsas River, at El Infiernillo Dam. In 1961-62 he conducted the reconstruction of the Tenayuca pyramid superposition 6, and was exploring Huejotla, Texcoco archaeological site. In 1964 the INAH assigns him the whole reconstruction of Santa Cecilia Acatitla ruins, Estado de M√©xico. In 1970 he was named Chief of Archaeological Sites Maintenance of INAH. During the same year he moved to Palenque, with the task of developing the studies on the unknown surroundings of the site. In 1972 he conducted consolidation works at Tulum ruins, and in 1973 he developed the project for the Archaeological Museum of Tlapacoya, Estado de M√©xico. During 1975 was in charge of developing excavations and reconstructive tasks in Calixtlahuaca, and later in Tepetlaoztoc (1978), and in Ex-Convent of Churubusco (1980‚Äì81). Achievements His most important contributions to Mexican archaeology were the recovering of the ruins of Santa Cecilia Acatitlan and the studies about the yacatas structures in the Michoac√°n area of Tzintzuntzan. He also initiated the archaeological works showing the mural paintings of the Cholula pyramid in Puebla. He taught history of Mexican art and architecture during 35 years, at the National School of Anthropology and the National Academy of San Carlos, in Mexico City.

Around three fourths of the former royal residence were pulled down during the French Revolution in 1796. The remaining wing of the ch√¢teau Plessis-l√®z-Tours was the favorite residence of King Louis XI of France, who died there on 30 August 1483. It was also the scene of the 1589 meeting between King Henry III of France and the future King Henry IV of France which resulted in their alliance against the Catholic League. The present building is only a small part of the ch√¢teau originally built by Louis XI in the 15th century. The original ch√¢teau had three wings in the shape of a U. The room where Louis XI died can be visited. It has late 15th-century wooden linenfold panelling. The first floor has paintings and sculpture devoted to St. Francis of Paola, whom Louis XI summoned to live near him until his death.Ch√¢teaux de la Loire, Michelin Guide de Tourisme, 1987 Edition Inside the ch√¢teau is a display of iron cages which were suspended from the ceiling and used to hold prisoners. The cages were so small that the prisoners were unable to stand. The remaining wing, which had long been used as a dairy farm and a buckshot factory, has been listed as a monument historique since 1927 by the French Ministry of Culture.

Prior to this, in 1949, a ground breaking conference was held in Boulder, Colorado, endorsing a model of study for clinicians that to this day has dominated clinical programs at most University based institutions: the scientist‚Äìpractitioner model, designed to provide a rigorous grounding in research methods and a breadth of exposure to clinical psychology. Before this, research scientists had dominated the field of psychological work, and this second, new model, known as the 'Vail' model, called for more practitioner-oriented course work. =Features= Several features differentiate the practitioner-scholar model from the other two: * Training in this model is more strongly focused on clinical practice than either of the other two. * Many (but not all) of these training programs grant a Psy.D. degree rather than a Ph.D. or Ed.D. * Admissions criteria may place more of an emphasis on personal qualities of the applicants or clinically related work experience. * Accepts a much larger number of students than the typical Ph.D. degree. * These programs are typically housed in a greater variety of institutional settings than are research scientist or scientist-practitioner programs. Like scientist-practitioner training, practitioner-scholar training is characterized by core courses in both basic and applied psychology, supervision during extensive clinical experience, and research consumption.

They appear together in J√≥msv√≠kinga saga, Nj√°ls saga, and √ûorleifs √æ√°ttr jarlssk√°lds. Irpa's name does not appear outside of these four attestations, but √ûorger√∞r also appears in the Prose Edda book Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, F√¶reyinga saga, and Har√∞ar saga ok H√≥lmverja and is mentioned in Ketils saga h≈ìngs. √ûorger√∞r H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r is particularly associated with Haakon Sigurdsson (d. 995), and, in J√≥msv√≠kinga saga and √ûorleifs √æ√°ttr jarlssk√°lds, √ûorger√∞r and Irpa are described as sisters. The roles of the √ûorger√∞r H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r and Irpa in these sources and the implications of their names has been the topic of some scholarly discourse and conjecture. Etymology The name √ûorger√∞r H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r is Old Norse and literally means \\"√ûorger√∞r, H√∂lgi's bride.\\"Simek (2007) pp 326-327. According to Sk√°ldskaparm√°l chapter 42, H√∂lgi (a traditional eponym of the northernmost Norwegian province H√•logaland) is also √ûorger√∞r's father. The first name √ûorger√∞r is a compound of two names: the god name √ûor (Thor) and ger√∞r ‚Äì the latter name meaning \\"fenced in\\".Orchard (1997) p 54. The figure's second name sometimes appears in sources featuring -br√∫√∞r replaced with -troll, and, in place of H√∂lg-, the prefixes H√∂r√∞a-, H√∂rga-, and H√∂lda- also appear. It has been suggested that name √ûorger√∞r derives from the name of the j√∂tunn Ger√∞r, as √ûorger√∞r is also described at times as a troll or giantess. Alternatively, Ger√∞r may simply be an abbreviated version of the name √ûorger√∞r.Chadwick (1950) pp 400-401. √ûorger√∞r is referred to as Ger√∞r in Tindr Hallkelsson‚Äôs 10th century dr√°pa on Haakon, quoted in chapter 43 of √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar, found in the Heimskringla. John McKinnell states that the name of √ûorger√∞r's father is probably a later addition used to explain the origins of the name of H√•logaland, and that \\"H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r\\" probably means \\"bride of the (rulers of) H√•logaland\\" and that H√∂r√∞abr√∫√∞r, similarly, may mean \\"bride of the (rulers of) H√∂r√∞aland.\\"McKinnell (2005) pp 84-85. H√∂r√∞abr√∫√∞r as \\"bride of the heathen shrines,\\" and h√∂ldabr√∫√∞r as either \\"bride of the people of Holde\\" or \\"bride of noblemen.\\" McKinnell says that the variety of stories and names suggest that the tradition of √ûorger√∞r H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r was wide spread, and that she was venerated in more than one area. The name Irpa may derive from the Old Norse term jarpr \\"dark brown\\", which has led to a number of theories about the goddess.Simek (2007) p 176. Jarpr is thought to derive from the earlier Proto-Germanic word *erpa-.Hellquist (1922) p 286. Attestations √ûorger√∞r and/or Irpa are attested in the following works: =J√≥msv√≠kinga saga= Clouds cover the sky, daylight becomes sparse, thunder and lightning ring out, and it begins to rain in an illustration of J√≥msv√≠kinga saga (1897) by Halfdan Egedius. Irpa appears in chapter 21 of the J√≥msv√≠kinga saga, which focuses on the late 10th century Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr between the fleet of the Jomsvikings under Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson and the fleet of Haakon Sigurdsson and Sweyn Haakonsson. Haakon calls a meeting during a lull in the fighting, and says that he feels that the tide of the battle is going against his allies and him. Haakon then goes to an island called Primsigned, north of Hj√≥runga Bay.Hollander (1955) p 94\\\\. The location of the island is described as being north of a skerry in the center of Hj√≥runga Bay. South of the skerry lies the island of Horund. On the island, Haakon falls to his knees, and, while looking northward, prays to what is described as his patron goddess, √ûorger√∞r H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r. According to the saga, √ûorger√∞r repeatedly refuses his offers, but finally accepts the bl√≥t of his 7-year-old son. Haakon's slave, Skopti, slaughters the boy.Hollander (1955) p 100. Haakon returns to his fleet and presses his men to engage in an attack, and commends his men to (\\"√ûorger√∞r\\" is here anglicized as \\"Thorgerd\\"): > Press the attack all the more vigorously, because I have invoked for victory > both the sisters, Thorgerd and Irpa.Hollander (1955) p 101. Haakon enters his ship, the fleet rows forward for the attack, and battle ensues. The weather becomes thick in the north, the clouds cover the sky, daylight becomes sparse, thunder and lightning ring out, and it begins to rain. The Jomvikings fleet fights facing the storm and cold, and they have trouble standing due to the heavy wind. The Jomsvikings throw weapons, missiles, and stones at Haakon's fleet but the winds turn their projectiles back at them. H√°vard the Hewing, in the fleet of Haakon, first spots √ûorger√∞r there and then many others see her. The wind wanes and the men witness arrows flying from the fingertips of √ûorger√∞r, each arrow killing a man of the Jomsviking fleet. The Jomsvikings tell Sigvaldi that although they are no longer fighting men alone, they will still do their best. The storm lessens again and once again Haakon invokes √ûorger√∞r. The saga describes this attack: > And then it grew dark again with a squall, this time even stronger and worse > than before. And right at the beginning of the squall H√°vard the Hewing saw > that two women were standing on the earl's ship, and both were doing the > same thing that Thorgerd had done before.Hollander (1955) p 102. Sigvaldi tells his men to retreat, and reasons that this is not what he vowed to fight, especially since there are now two women, whom he refers to as \\"ogresses\\" and \\"trolls.\\" After the Jomvikings fleet has been defeated, Haakon's men weigh the hailstones that had fallen during the storm, to detect \\"what power\\" √ûorger√∞r and Irpa had, and they find that the hailstones weigh an ounce each.Hollander (1955) p 104. =Nj√°ls saga= √ûorger√∞r and Irpa are again mentioned together in chapter 88 of Nj√°ls saga, set in the 10th and 11th centuries. Here, Hrapp breaks into the temple owned by Haakon and Gudbrand while Haakon is at a feast at Gudbrand's home. Hrapp plunders a seated depiction of √ûorger√∞r; he takes a large gold ring from her plus the linen hood she is wearing. Next, Hrapp spots a depiction of Thor and Thor's wain. He takes a gold ring from the depiction of Thor too, and, thirdly, he takes a ring from a depiction of Irpa there. Hrapp takes all of the images from the temple, strips them of their items, and then burns the temple until leaving at dawn.Hollander (1997) p 171. =Sk√°ldskaparm√°l= √ûorger√∞r is mentioned in the Prose Edda book Sk√°ldskaparm√°l. Here, H√•logaland is described as named after king H√∂lgi, and that he was √ûorger√∞r's father. According to Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, bl√≥t were made to them both that included money, and a tumulus was made for H√∂lgi that was built with layers of gold and silver, then covered by a layer of earth and stone.Faulkes (1995) p 112. Later in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, a list of \\"troll-wives\\" is given that includes H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r.Faulkes (1995) p 75. =F√¶reyinga Saga= In chapter 23 of F√¶reyinga Saga, Haakon asks Sigmund where he puts his trust. Sigmund responds that he puts his trust nowhere but with himself. Haakon responds: \\"Offering\\" by J. L. Lund, depicting a sacrifice to an image of Thor. > \\"That must not be,\\" the Earl [Haakon] answered, \\"but thou shalt put thy > trust where I have put all my trust, namely, in Thorgerd Shinebright,\\" said > he. \\"And we will go and see her now and seek luck for thee at her > hands.\\"Powell (1896) p 31. The two then follow a small path through the woods until they come to a house with a stake fence around it. The house is described as beautiful, featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door. The saga relates that Haakon throws himself to the ground before the woman for some time. When he gets up, he tells Sigmund that they should give her an offering, that they ought to lay silver on the stool before her. Haakon says: > And we shall have it as a mark of what she thinks of this, if she will do as > I wish and let the ring loose which holds in her hand. For thou, Sigmund, > shalt get luck by that ring. Haakon takes hold of the ring, and, seemingly to Sigmund, she clasps her hand around it. Haakon does not receive the ring. Haakon casts himself down before her a second time, and Sigmund notices that Haakon is weeping. He stands up again, takes hold of the ring, and finds that it has become loose. Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund, and tells him that he must never part with it. Sigmund gives him his word on it and the men part, each returning to their ships. A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart, and many days are described as passing afterwards. =Har√∞ar saga ok H√≥lmverja= \\"King Olaf in Thor's hof\\" (1897), illustration from √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar by Halfdan Egedius. In chapter 19 of the saga Har√∞ar saga ok H√≥lmverja, Gr√≠mkell Bjarnarson, a go√∞i closely related to Haakon, goes to the temple (Old Norse hof) of √ûorger√∞r H√∂rgabr√∫√∞r to ask for a successful marriage for his daughter. When he arrives, the gods are preparing to leave. After an angry exchange with √ûorger√∞r, who tells him he does not have long to live, Gr√≠mkell burns down the hof with all the gods in it. Later that evening, Gr√≠mkell suddenly falls dead at dinner.Kellogg (1997) pp 214-215. =Ketils saga h≈ìngs= In chapter 5 of Ketils saga h≈ìngs, Ketill encounters a troll-woman in the forest. The troll- woman tells him she is traveling to a trolla-√æing‚Äîan assembly of trolls. Among the major figures who will be present, she continues, are Skelkingr, the king of the trolls, and √ûorger√∞r H√∂rgatr√∂ll.Chadwick (1950) p 397. =√ûorleifs √æ√°ttr jarlssk√°lds= In √ûorleifs √æ√°ttr jarlssk√°lds, √ûorleifr √Åsgeirsson, known as jarlssk√°ld (\\"the Jarl‚Äôs skald\\"), recites an abusive and magically aggressive poem in Earl Haakon's hall. In chapter 7 (chapter 173 of √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar), Haakon recovers from his injuries and offers gifts to √ûorger√∞r H√∂rdabr√∫√∞r and her sister Irpa, seeking their counsel on how best to take vengeance on √ûorleifr. Following their advice, Haakon has a wooden man (Old Norse tr√©ma√∞r) built out of driftwood and endows it with a human heart. Haakon and the two sisters then bring the tr√©ma√∞r to life, arm him with a halberd, and send him to Iceland to kill √ûorleifr, which he does.Jesch (1997) pp 365-368. Theories A number of theories surround the figures of √ûorger√∞r and Irpa:For a useful summary of existing scholarship and theories concerning √ûorger√∞r, see R√∏the (2006). =Guardian goddesses= The Stenbro picture stone on Gotland is one of several image stones that depict a dead man being received by a valkyrie in the afterlife. Hilda Ellis Davidson counts √ûorger√∞r and Irpa as examples of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles to that of the d√≠sir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of H√•logaland, it would explain √ûorger√∞r's last name (\\"bride of Helgi\\") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same argument has been advanced by McKinnell.McKinnell (2002) p 268: \\"All the variants of √ûorger√∞r's name make sense if we take it that she was regarded as the jarl's sexual partner, and that the separate name H«´lgi applied to him or to any of his dead predecessors.\\" Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem H√°konarm√°l as an example. =√ûorger√∞r and Freyja= Davidson further theorizes that √ûorger√∞r's name may have originally been Ger√∞r, reasons that this form is what is found in early skaldic verse, and, further, that this is one of the names given for the goddess Freyja.Davidson (1998) pp 177‚Äì178. Davidson points out that Haakon may have later turned to the same goddess soon before he met his death, when he hid in the earth beneath a swine in √ìl√°fs saga Tryggvasonar (collected in Heimskringla) chapter 48, and that this could symbolize a mound of Freyja, one of whose names means \\"sow\\" (Old Norse s√Ωr). Davidson theorizes that the account of Olaf I of Norway dragging √ûorger√∞r's image out of its temple after Haakon's death, and burning it next to a depiction of Freyr (Freyja's male twin), further supports this view. =Irpa= Irpa has been proposed as an earth goddess due to the derivation of her name to a word for \\"dark brown\\",Simek (2007) p 327. but F.R. Schr√∂der has expressed criticism at the notion of concluding that Irpa is an earth goddess based on this evidence. John McKinnell proposes that the Irpa may represent a \\"dark\\" aspect of √ûorger√∞r, in that her name may mean \\"swarthy,\\" and that the two were probably of contrasting appearance; Irpa being unlucky to name and seen as a troll. McKinnell further proposes a connection between Irpa and Hel, stating that the two may have been seen as synonymous. =Miscellaneous theories= Nora Chadwick (1950) suggested that mythical legends of √ûorger√∞r and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon's wife √û√≥ra and her sister, Gu√∞r√∫n;Chadwick (1950) p 408. and that the figure of the shieldmaiden Lagertha in the Gesta may also be an aspect of √ûorger√∞r.Chadwick (1950) p 414. Lotte Motz (1993) proposed that √ûorger√∞r was a rare instance of a giantess who was the recipient of cultic worship in her own right in heathen Scandinavia.Motz (1993) p 78: ‚ÄúFrom a local daimon she has turned into a national deity.‚Äù NotesReferences * Chadwick, Nora K.

Glass Etc. - James Giles Family History His father, also James Giles, was of a Huguenot family named 'Gilles', from N√Æmes. James senior was recorded in 1729 as being a 'China Painter' and living in London. His son, Abraham, was recorded in the same year as being apprenticed to Philip Margas, of the Glass Sellers' Company, whereas James junior was indentured in 1733 to John Arthur, a jeweller at St Martin-in-the- Fields. Career Dr. Wall Worcester porcelain dessert plate in the Japanese Arita ware style About 1756 he rented a workshop with a kiln in Kentish Town and by 1763 had moved on to Berwick Street. A few years later he started a showroom in the Arts Museum in Cockspur Street, opposite the Haymarket, seemingly with the support of the Worcester porcelain factory. When his collaboration with Worcester ended in 1771, he moved to an address in the same street at the north-west corner of Trafalgar Square. Giles bought his undecorated porcelain and glass from a large number of sources, resulting in glassware of great variety in shape, size and colour, in turn leading to an enormous diversity of bijouterie for the luxury trade. He advertised widely, strangely failing to mention his glassware in the many notices that were placed in \\"The Public Advertiser\\" between 1767 and 1776. His first advertisement, in \\"Mortimer's Universal Director\\" of 1763, stated that 'This ingenious Artist copies the Pattern of any China with the utmost exactness, both with respect to the Design and the Colours, either in the European or Chinese taste ... [and that] ... He has also brought the Enamel Colours to great perfection'. The business ledgers for 1771‚Äì76 still exist. They record orders for some 50 000 Worcester pieces between 1771 and 1774, and glass bought for ¬£234 from William Parker's Glass Warehouse in Fleet Street - a figure amounting to fifteen per cent of Giles's annual budget. William Parker was a leading glass merchant as was another of Giles's suppliers, the Falcon glasshouse, near Southwark Bridge. The business was covered by Sun Insurance policies that valued his stock at ¬£2 000 in November 1771, substantially more than the stock valuation of ¬£680 for the Worcester factory at that time. Financial Problems Chinese export porcelain painted by Giles Although he created outstanding works of art, Giles was financially incompetent. Dealing with the aristocracy and the affluent led to lengthy delays in their settling of accounts - delays of a few years were commonplace. Richard Sheridan, for instance, settled his account three years after taking delivery. Worthies such as Lord Palmerston, Lord Melbourne, Lady Jersey and the Duchess of Leinster only paid their accounts after Giles's death and under pressure from the creditors. Bowl with birds His declaration of bankruptcy in 1774 was brought about by his rivals in porcelain decorating, notably Worcester porcelain, in order to eliminate him from the trade. His many bankruptcies and their documentary trail have provided a rich source of information for modern scholars. On the other hand, he showed great skill in dealing with his staff, enabling his workshop to turn out a prodigious number of pieces of the highest quality. His staff would have included his daughters, Mary (1741‚Äì1806) and Sarah Teresa (1742‚Äì1800). Others employed were Lewis Barbar, a Swedish miniaturist and 'China Painter', and a Frenchman, Fidelle Duvivier. Aesthetic Qualities The identification of Giles's work is bedevilled by an absence of signatures or marks. Two Christie's auctions over this period help to clear up uncertainty by the complete catalogue descriptions of some 1 400 lots. His porcelain styles of decoration, despite their quality, are sometimes rightly criticised for being stylistically derivative, causing problems to all but the most knowledgeable of experts. His work in the style of S√®vres and Meissen is particularly difficult to attribute. The same observation cannot be made of his quite distinctive glasswork which in most respects was original. Some of his work was exported to America - notes from his ledger record sales between 1772 and 1775 of seven 'Parcels of China & Glass' to Sir Egerton Leigh, 1st Baronet, Attorney General of South Carolina for the princely sum of ¬£380.Apollo June 2005 ReferencesExternal links *A Short History of Eighteenth-century English Glass Category:1718 births Category:1780 deaths Category:English artists Category:Glass artists Category:English potters Category:English ceramists Category:Ceramics decorators ","title":"James Giles (porcelain decorator)"},{"id":"18025193","text":"Kakki Khel is a town in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan.

History  The mansion was built in the beginning of the 1900s as a private residence for Kostaki Teophylaktos, a notable banker of Greek origin. It is known that the architect was of Italian origin and many materials used in the building were brought from Italy. However, the name of the architect is unknown. As Teophylaktos went bankrupt in 1917, all his properties were confiscated, among them his mansion. The building was acquired by the Nemlioƒülu family. During the timespan of Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1923), the mansion was used as the headquarters for the military in the region. In 1924, it was prepared for the first visit of Mustafa Kemal, the founder of the Turkish Republic, to Trabzon. Between September 15‚Äì17, he and the First Lady Latife stayed in the mansion. In 1927, the building was nationalized by the Governor of Trabzon Ali Galip Bey, and served until 1931 as the Governor's House. Between 1931-1937, it was used as the inspector's office. The Kostaki Mansion was assigned in 1937 to the Ministry of National Education, and was used for fifty years long as a vocational high school for girls. Finally, in 1987, the building was handed over to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism to be transformed into a museum.  Museum  The building, one of the outstanding examples of the civil architecture in Turkey, was restored between 1988-2001. On April 22, 2001, it was opened to public as the Trabzon Museum. A total of 3,651 items are found in the museum's inventory. The building is on three levels in addition to a basement. The basement comprises archeological works, while the first floor is the section for ethnographic collections. On the ground floor, items belonging to the architecture and history of the mansion are exhibited. The attic is reserved for the administration. = Archeological section = In this section, old coins and a wide range of items are exhibited, among them of marble, basalt, ceramic, metal and glas from Bronze Age (3300‚Äì1200 BCE), Classic stage (AD 250 ‚Äì 900), Hellenistic (323-146 BC), Roman (753 BC-AD 1453) and Byzantine (330-1453) periods. = About the Mansion = The ground floor is prepared to show the architecture of the building and history of the mansion in chronological order. The walls of all the rooms are decorated with near Baroque style hand carved ornamental works. = Ethnographic section = In this section, items are on display that are characteristic for the region. Also exhibited are Islamic works and items from the Ottoman period (1299-1923).

Here we have men in armor behaving like real flesh and blood people , and we quite forget we are not contemporaries with them.... We can safely say that there is no obtrusive note of anachronism in the whole first installment. It has been produced in a reasonably scholarly way. Perhaps better than the staging even is the humanity of the characters...To sum up, we find the first installment of this picture a very entertaining romantic story, full of lively and naturally produced action, well-drawn characters, clear photographs and fairly scholarly staging. We commend it highly as a first-class offering and think that it will prove a door, as it were, to better work of this kind than we have had before as a general thing.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1914 films Category:1914 drama films Category:1914 short films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:American drama films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Charles Giblyn Category:Films about Fran√ßois Villon Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Cultural depictions of Fran√ßois Villon Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XI of France ","title":"The Oubliette"},{"id":"18025249","text":"Kala Khel Masti Khan is a town and union council of Bannu District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Bannu References Category:Union councils of Bannu District Category:Populated places in Bannu District ","title":"Kala Khel Masti Khan"},{"id":"18025301","text":"Kawajamad is a town and union council in Bannu District of Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Bannu References Category:Union councils of Bannu District Category:Populated places in Bannu District ","title":"Kawajamad"},{"id":"18025333","text":"Bunch Reservoir is one of a trio of lakes on the Little Colorado River that provides trout fishing opportunities in and around the town of Greer.

The film was produced by Paul Schiff and released by Blowtorch Entertainment as their first original production. After being screened at several film festivals and independent theaters, Tenure was first released on DVD exclusively at Blockbuster Video stores on February 19, 2010. A national release followed in April 2010.  Plot  Charlie Thurber (Luke Wilson) is a beleaguered English professor at fictional Grey College (a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania) who competes for tenure against an impressive new hire from Yale, Elaine Grasso (Gretchen Mol). Jay Hadley (David Koechner) is an anthropology professor at Grey who tries to convince Thurber to sabotage Grasso‚Äôs career ‚Äì while being simultaneously obsessed with trying to prove the authenticity of Bigfoot. Thurber's articles are rejected by a series of academic journals and he worries about becoming a victim of the \\"publish or perish\\" pressures of professorship. And despite competing for the same job, Thurber and Grasso begin developing a friendship after she flounders as a classroom teacher and asks him for advice. Meanwhile, Thurber struggles with a series of personal problems: his sister pesters him for money to pay for their father's retirement home; a smitten female student is aggressively flirtatious; and rather than admit he's single, Thurber hires a woman of questionable sanity to act as his girlfriend for a dinner with Grasso and her snobbish boyfriend. Thurber's tenure review with college officials seems to be a disaster until the dean casts a tie-breaking vote, noting that Thurber's students gave him exemplary reviews and clearly adore him. Thurber is offered probational tenure, with the caveat that his classroom teaching will be severely reduced so that he can devote more time to publishing in respectable academic outlets. The film concludes with Thurber inviting his ailing father to move in with him, Grasso dumping her boyfriend and hinting that she would like to pursue a relationship with Thurber, and Thurber quitting Grey College to teach at a high school so that he can remain in the classroom with students.

Through private individual contributions, corporate philanthropy and community-based fundraising activities, the Foundation has raised more than $500 million since its founding and is the largest non-governmental source of research funds for inherited retinal degenerative diseases.Gene Therapy Provides Vision to People who Were Nearly Blind Reuters, accessed July 16, 2008 Diseases studied Foundation-funded scientists at institutions throughout the world conduct research for the entire spectrum of retinal degenerative diseases including: retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, Usher syndrome, Stargardt disease, Best disease, choroideremia, retinoschisis, Leber congenital amaurosis, Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome, cone dystrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, rod‚Äìcone dystrophy, achromatopsia, Refsum disease, and other rare retinal degenerative diseases. Research and Clinical Trials The Foundation funds research in a number of scientific areas including: genetics, gene therapy, nutrition, stem cells, and pharmaceutical therapies. Retina International, accessed July 16, 2008 After decades of Foundation-funded research, several promising treatments have moved into human clinical trials, including a landmark gene therapy human study for Leber congenital amaurosis, which has enabled more than 40 children and young adults who were virtually blind to read several lines on an eye chart and see in dimly lit settings.\\"Gene Therapy Improves Vision in Patients with Congenital Retinal Disease.\\", American Foundation for the Blind, accessed July 16, 2008 This success paved the way for the development of gene therapies now in clinical trials to treat a wide range of other retinal conditions, including Stargardt disease, Usher syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration. Valproic acid, a drug that is FDA-approved to treat epilepsy, has shown promise for preserving vision in people with certain forms of retinitis pigmentosa. The Foundation has launched a human trial to test this drug and, if effective, move it quickly out to patients who need it. Foundation-funded researchers are using stem cells derived from a variety of sources, including a person's own skin, to create healthy retinal cells that can potentially restore vision. Stem cell treatments hold great promise for people with advanced vision loss. The Foundation is also funding clinical trials of a tiny innovative capsule that is inserted into the eye to slow vision loss from a variety of retinal degenerative diseases.\\"Long-term Retinal Implant Study Offers Hope For Treating Blindness.\\", Science Daily, accessed July 16, 2008 Foundation Fighting Blindness Clinical Research Institute The Foundation Fighting Blindness Clinical Research Institute works to accelerate the translation of laboratory-based research into clinical trials for treatments and cures of retinal degenerative diseases. As a support organization and the translational arm of the Foundation Fighting Blindness, it aims to develop a bridge between scientific, clinical, governmental, pharmaceutical and financial communities to advance clinical trials of sight- saving treatments and therapies. The FFB Clinical Research Institute invests funds to support Phase I and Phase II clinical trials to expedite the commercialization of treatments for conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, Usher syndrome and the entire spectrum of retinal diseases, and also provides assistance to the management of clinical trials and subsequent commercialization. Grants The Foundation Fighting Blindness currently funds more than 120 grants, including the modules of 14 Centers. The research projects of these grants are conducted by research investigators at more than 70 Institutions, Eye Hospitals and Universities. In addition to funding researchers within the United States, Foundation funding extends internationally including laboratories in Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, China, and the Netherlands. Fundraising and Public Education The Foundation has nearly 50 volunteer-led chapters across the U.S. These volunteers raise funds for research, increase public awareness, and provide support to their communities. Through its communications and public health outreach programs, the Foundation educates individuals affected with retinal disease and their families about research developments, clinical trials, and coping with low vision. In addition to grants and individual and corporate gifts, the Foundation hosts a series of fundraising events across the country, including VisionWalks, Dining in the Dark dinners, and Visionary Awards galas. As promising treatments move into critical human studies, the need for research funding is greater than ever before. VisionWalk VisionWalk is the national signature fundraising event of the Foundation Fighting Blindness that also acts as a celebration of the Fighting Blindness community. Occurring every fall in 36 locations, participants join teams and fund raise in the month leading up to the event. The event itself is a 5k walk to fund raise for research sponsored by FFB, as well as to raise awareness of low vision and blind individuals. There is an emphasis on the ability and accomplishments of people impacted by lack of vision. Since its inception in the spring of 2006, the program has raised over $55 million to fund sight- saving research with over 200,000 participants in the form of volunteers, team members and, sponsors. Due to the COVID-19 virus, the FFB held the fall 2020 VisionWalk online, asking participants to take steps to support the virtual VisionWalk by using a treadmill, going on a socially distanced walk, or having a virtual meeting with teammates. Dining in the Dark The Foundation Fighting Blindness hosts approximately 10 annual Dining in the Dark fundraising events in various cities around the U.S. Meant to increase awareness about the challenges of the visually impaired, Dining in the Dark is an event where participants dine in the dark. This idea of \\"dark dining\\" is not unique to the foundation, as it is also practised in other locations. Race to Cure Blindness Race to Cure Blindness is a fundraising program where participants utilize any marathon, triathlon, bike race, or other racing event as a platform to raise money for the Foundation Fighting Blindness. VISIONS Conference VISIONS is the national conference of the Foundation Fighting Blindness. It is the only event of its kind - created solely for individuals and families who are affected by retinal diseases. Nowhere else will people find such easy access to information on the latest retinal research and clinical trials, the doctors performing the work, coping strategies, and other families from around the country living with the same diseases. Vision Seminar Series The Foundation Fighting Blindness' Vision Seminar Series provides a supportive learning environment for people living with macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and other inherited retinal degenerative diseases. Held around the country, each half-day, free seminar offers patients a forum to hear from prominent doctors and scientists about the latest retinal degenerative disease research, new treatments, therapies, and clinical trials. Vision Seminars not only give affected individuals and their families critical information about research and treatments, but they also provide the hope necessary to cope with these debilitating diseases. Partners for Retinal Health Through its Partners for Retinal Health program, the Foundation works with retinal specialists throughout the country to provide the information, resources and hope patients need upon being diagnosed with a retinal degenerative disease.

Known by Wes, he was born at Deer Island, New Brunswick, the son of Andrew Holmes Stuart and Laura Gertrude Thompson. Raised in a place where fishing was a major part of the economy, in addition to fishing for a living, he worked as a government fishing industry inspector. In the 1945 Canadian federal election, Stuart was elected as the Liberal Party's candidate for the riding of Charlotte. He was reelected in 1949, 1953, and again in 1957. Wesley Stuart lived on the bank of the St. Croix River and as was common for residents, he frequently travelled across the border to Maine. A proponent of free trade between Canada and the United States, in 1951 Stuart received much publicly in both countries for his statements in the House of Commons of Canada on cross- border smuggling. Time magazine reported that he declared he had \\"been a smuggler all his life‚Äîand intended to keep on being one,\\" adding that he \\"never came through [the border] in my lifetime that I did not smuggle something.\\" Stuart's straight talk met with wide approval by his constituents and in the ensuing federal election, he won his third term in office with the largest majority of his political career. In the 1958 electoral sweep by the Progressive Conservatives under John Diefenbaker, Stuart lost his seat to Caldwell Stewart. While remaining active in politics, he was the runner up to Louis Robichaud in a bid for leader of the provincial Liberals later in 1958 and went on to serve as the New Brunswick Liberal Party President from 1960 to 1963. On October 23, 1924, he married Julia Marguerite Graham (1899‚Äì1961) . The couple had three children (Janet Saint, Roy Graham \\"Bud\\" Stuart, and Jacqueline (Jackie) Smith).

Born in a small comune at the border between the Papal State and the Borbon State, son of Vincenzo and Sinforosa Arquati; he dedicated himself to the political life, took part in the citizens' government and in 1851 was included in the lottery for nomination to 'prior', following his nationalistic and secular feelings away from the land of his birth, first towards Sublicio and then Rome.  A warriors' love story  In 1844, he met Giuditta Tavani, a girl of barely fourteen, being a frequent visitor to the material warehouse of her father. They married almost immediately in the parish of S. Crisogono in Rome. In spite of Giuditta's young age, she saw in Francesco a man who, like her, loved 'liberty' and supported a secular Italian State. They married immediately and fought together to defend the Roman Republic, which, nevertheless fell into French hands in 1849, restoring the Papal Government. They followed the retreat towards the Adriatic to avoid heavy papal reprisals, they headed, with Garibaldi, towards Venice. Subsequently, still refugees, passing through Romagna, where they continued to conspire, then re-entered Rome, hidden to organise its liberation. Here they frequented the home and the wool shop of Giulio Ajani (1835‚Äì1890), a forgotten patriot of the time, in the Lungaretta in Trastevere.  The battle in the Ajani wool mill.  In the late morning of 25 October 1867 around forty 'patriots', of whom twenty-five were Romans were meeting in via della Lungaretta 97, in the Roman region of Trastevere, within Giulio Ajani's wool factory. The group, who were conspiring against the government of Pope Pius IX, anticipated that a direct attack by Giuseppe Garibaldi on Rome would follow shortly after. The battle at Villa Glori on 23 October 1867 caused everyone to expect an attack and a popular uprising. Francesco Arquati, his wife, one of their three sons, Antonio, and their comrades had gathered to prepare cartridges, restock the rifles of their arsenal, and be ready to support Garibaldi, in what they thought would be an imminent attack on Rome. At around half past twelve, a platoon of papal zuavos from via del Moro, the perpendicular street in Trastevere attacked the wool- mill building. The conspirators tried to resist the fire. Within a short time, however, the papal troops had the better of the situation, and managed to take the building. A few conspirators managed to escape whilst others were captured. In the fire, nine people were killed, amongst whom, Giudita Arquati, pregnant with her fourth child, her husband and their young son. In 1939, the remains of Francesco, his wife Giuditta, and their son Antonio, were transported to the Monumental Charnel House on the Janiculum hill.  The memory  The figures of Francesco and Giuditta Arquati became symbols of the struggle for the liberation of Rome and for years the inhabitants of Trastevere and their secular and republican associations commemorated the slaughter.

A typical commercial mortgage transaction can include several documents including: * promissory note * environmental indemnity * trust deed * mortgage * guaranty Some of these documents can contain as many as 80 to 100 pages, with hundreds of optional paragraphs and data elements. Document automation software has the ability to automatically fill in the correct document variables based on the transaction data. In addition, some document automation software has the ability to create a document suite where all related documents are encapsulated into one file, making updates and collaboration easy and fast. Simpler software applications that are easier to learn can also be used to automate the preparation of documents, without undue complexity. For example, Pathagoras holds itself out as a 'plain text, no fields allowed' document assembly system. Clipboard managers allow the user to save frequently-used text fragments, organize them into logical groups, and then quickly access them to paste into final documents.  In supply chain management  There are many documents used in logistics. They are called: invoices, packing lists/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement forms/reports of many types (e.g. MSDS, damaged goods, returned goods, detailed/summary, etc.), import/export, delivery, bill of lading (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor, so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a third party logistics company (3PL) and governments. Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible polybag or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems. Protection of Privacy and Identity Theft are major concerns, especially with the increase of e-Commerce, Internet/Online shopping and Shopping channel (other, past references are catalogue and mail order shopping) making it more important than ever to guarantee the correct document is married or associated to the correct order or shipment every time. Software that produce documents are: ERP, WMS, TMS, legacy middleware and most accounting packages. A number of research projects have looked into wider standardization and automation of documents in the freight industry.IATA. Cargo-XML Standards: Modernizing air cargo communication.  In legal services  Automation technology may be used in the production of legal documents, such as employment contracts and estate planning documents, potentially with the use of an online interface or decision tree. In large law firms document assembly systems are often used to systemize work, such as through the creation of complex term sheets and the first drafts of credit agreements. With the liberalisation of the UK legal services market spearheaded by the Legal Services Act 2007 large institutions have broadened their services to include legal assistance for their customers.Article: Braced for the big bang and Tesco law Jon Robins The TimesArticle: A trip to the shops can end in divorce Ellen Kelleher The Financial Times Most of these companies use some element of document automation technology to provide legal document services over the Web.Article: Why big brand legal services are bad news for solicitors Neil Rose The Guardian (Tuesday 2 November 2010) This has been seen as heralding a trend towards commoditisation whereby technologies like document automation result in high volume, low margin legal services being ‚Äòpackaged‚Äô and provided to a mass-market audience.Article: Commoditisation of Legal Services - What It Means for the Future of Legal Practice Sylvia Lowe Law GazetteArticle: From bespoke to commodity Professor Richard Susskind OBE Legal Technology Journal (2006)Article: The commodities business Professor Richard Susskind OBE The Law Society Gazette (Thursday 13 April 2006)  In insurance  Insurance policies and certificates, depending on the type, policy documents can also be hundreds of pages long and include specific information on the insured. Typically, in the past, these insurance document packets were created by a) typing out free-form letters, b) adding pre-printed brochures c) editing templates and d) customizing graphics with the required information, then manually sorting and inserting all the documents into one packet and mailing them to the insured. The various documents included in one packet could include the following kinds of documents: * Welcome letter * Contract * Certificate * State-specific policy documents * Listing of items insured and insurance amounts * Amendments * Riders * ID card * Company information * Marketing material (other products) A lot of work can go into putting one packet together. In most policy admin systems, the system will generate some kind of policy statement as a starting point but might need to be customized and enhanced with other required materials.

Murray) of South Dakota. It appeared somewhere around 1880 published in several American newspapers.Pound, Poetic Origins and the Ballad, p. 208: \\"The Little Old Sod Shanty was printed somewhere about the later seventies or eighties in many Nebraska newspapers, with the statement that it could be sung to the tune of The Little Old Log Cabin. Some old settlers remember having cards with photographs of a sod shanty on one side and on the other the words of the song.\\" The printings suggested that it be sung to the tune of \\"The Little Old Log Cabin In The Lane\\" written by Will Hays in 1871. The song tells of the trials of homesteading on the Great Plains and became immensely popular among the settlers. The title comes from variations of a refrain found in the verses and the chorus: :... my little old sod shanty on my claim. Jack Thorp published a version of the song in his 1908 book, Songs of the Cowboys, titled \\"Little Adobe Casa\\" which he attributed to a Tom Beasley written in 1887.Thorp, \\"Little Adobe Casa\\", p. 93: \\"By Tom Beasley. Written in the spring of 1887 and sung in the cow-camps by the author, who had a good voice.

He is a right arm fast-medium bowler and a right-handed lower order batsman. In first class cricket, he plays for Uttar Pradesh. In the Indian Premier League, he represented Chennai Super Kings. Tyagi first represented the senior Uttar Pradesh team at the 2007-08 Ranji Trophy competition, making his debut against Orissa in a game which was highlighted by a double-century from Suresh Raina. It was in this debut match that he took a six-wicket haul, helping his team to an innings victory - a bowling analysis which remains his first-class best. It took until the third match of the competition until he scored his first two first-class runs with the bat. Tyagi finished his stellar debut Ranji season with 41 wickets, the highest in the country. Later in the same month, he played one match in the Duleep Trophy competition, and in February he played in two games in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. While Tyagi missed most of the 2008-09 domestic season due to stress fracture, he re-emerged in 2009 IPL with some great spells. In July 2009, Tyagi travelled with the Indian Emerging Players squad to tour Australia, where the team played against their peers from Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Tyagi emerged by far the best bowler on show during the tournament, grabbing 14 wickets in 6 games at 18.21 a piece. Tyagi's strong upper body is built along the lines of his UP colleague Praveen Kumar but he is a few yards quicker than Kumar is. Tyagi and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was equally impressive in his debut domestic season in 2008-2009 and has attracted quite a bit of attention, along with R.P. Singh and Praveen Kumar, form a very impressive pace bowling quartet for Uttar Pradesh. He made his ODI debut in the fifth and final match of India's home series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 at the Feroz Shah Kotla. He took one wicket as India bowled first, but his debut was cut short when the umpires ended the match midway through the Sri Lankan innings after deeming the pitch to be unsafe.

This effect comes about as the head is moved in contrary or similar motion with the body during the time of a spin, this rotation of the head affects the semicircular canals within the ear which causes a sense of dizziness or nausea before equilibrium is restored after the head returns to a stabilized state.  History  Coriolis force was discovered by Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis in 1832. By the end of the nineteenth century, Coriolis force has become a common phrase in meteorological literature. Coriolis force is classified as a fictitious force that is applied to objects that are in rotation. When applied to perception, this occurs when a person's head is moved out of alignment during a spin. If individuals are spinning to the left along their y-axis and then push their head forward, that will bring their heads out of alignment and make it subject to Coriolis force and resultant effect. The manifestation of this effect is that the individuals will feel like their heads are tilting to their left. This can cause nausea, disorientation, and motion sickness. These feelings of discomfort arise in the body when the signals being sent by the vestibular system and visual system are not in agreement, i.e. the eyes may be telling your body that you are not moving, but your vestibular systems fine-tuned senses are depicting the opposite.  In the real world  The Coriolis effect is a concern for pilots, where it can cause extreme disorientation. This happens as pilots accelerate their aircraft and also need to check their instruments, which often involves moving their heads. This is particularly dangerous for an airborne pilot because it give the feeling that they are pitching, yawing, and rolling simultaneously; In extreme situations, this can cause the pilot to lose control of the aircraft.

Finch developed an interest in flying in the early 1970s and was particularly interested in World War II era aircraft. She has restored vintage airplanes and participated in races and airshows. She is most noted for her 1997 World Flight, recreating and completing Amelia Earhart's attempted world record. She flew a restored 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E, the same type of plane that Earhart flew in 1937 as she attempted her world flight. The plane was modified to contain a modern Global Positioning System, increased gasoline capacity, and modern communications equipment. She followed Earhart's route as closely as she could and completed the 26,000 mile trip around the world in 73 days. Partnered with Pratt & Whitney, who funded the restoration and flight, Finch established the You Can Soar educational and motivational program that allowed students in 200,000 classrooms to follow her flight. For the two and a half months of the flight, there were about 30 million hits on the educational website. Early life and education Finch was born at San Antonio, Texas on March 13, 1951. Her parents were Mary Beth Duerler and Leslie Duerler, who worked for a telephone company. Finch grew up with her two brothers, Michael and Jerry, initially in Highland Hills, a lowermiddleclass neighborhood southeast of downtown San Antonio. When she was in her early teens, the family moved to a more prosperous suburban area outside the city limits. When she was 16 years old she began dating a man around 19 years of age from the local Army base. He received orders to go to Vietnam. Finch quit John Marshall High School and they eloped to Mexico before he left for Vietnam. The couple had a daughter, Julie, born in February 1969. A year later the couple ended their marriage. Finch has always believed in the importance of self-reliance and ingenuity. She obtained her high school equivalent diploma when she was twenty years old. She studied accounting at Southwest Texas State University and obtained work at various bookkeeping jobs in New Jersey, Texas, South Dakota, Montana, and Illinois. Some of her bookkeeping jobs were at nursing facilities, where she enjoyed working with seniors.  Business career  Finch networked with the key townspeople to recruit 15 new residents a month as one of her first management duties for a nursing home in Aberdeen, South Dakota. Goal-driven and detail-oriented, she enjoyed the work and decided she wanted to own her own set of nursing homes. Finch financed her first nursing home facility in 1979 from money loaned to her by her grandparents, who refinanced their home with a new mortgage with the proviso that if she failed in this nursing home enterprise her family would pay off the mortgage but she would lose her inheritance. The loan for the business was guaranteed by a former employer from New Jersey. One of Finch's uncles, a pharmacist, for whom she had performed bookkeeping services, helped finance her second nursing home facility. She acquired five more nursing homes over the next two years that resulted in her owning seven facilities with a total of 750 residents. Finch at 31 years of age, in 1982, employed about 600 workers to run her facilities. She later organized Care Centers Management Corporation and began building retirement communities. By 1997 she owned retirement property, four nursing homes with 500 residents, and a construction firm that manufactures prefabricated buildings. At that time, her enterprises employed 500 people and earned $14 million in annual revenues. There were lawsuits tried against Finch and her businesses related to patient care and HUD financing.  Flying career  Vought F4U Corsair Republic P-47 Thunderbolt Having dreamt of flying a Vought F4U Corsair since she was a teenager, Finch used the money she budgeted for lunches while working as a bookkeeper to pay for flying lessons beginning about 1972, when she first flew solo in a Grumman trainer. And, as she began to scout for potential nursing homes to purchase, she thought it would be good idea to fly to each of these locations. She obtained her pilot's license in 1979 and about 1980 purchased a Piper Arrow, which she flew throughout Texas to manage her nursing homes. In the 1980s, she acquired a North American T-6 Texan, a World War II trainer which she completely restored to participate in air shows and races, like the Reno Air Races. She later flew her Beechcraft airplane to conduct business. She restored six vintage planes by 1997. Early in her flying career, Finch became a member of the Confederate Air Force (now Commemorative Air Force) Association, where she was taught to land the Republic P-47D Thunderbolt without power 100 times. At that time, it was unusual for an aviatrix to fly the P-47. She was a major fundraiser for the restoration and marketing of this rare aircraft, of which there are only a small number still flying. Finch has flown for over 8,000 hours with approximately 5,900 of these flying hours in vintage multi-engine aircraft, warbirds and tail draggers. She has flown in numerous air shows around the world for more than 20 years. World Flight 1997 Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Model 10 Electra In 1991, Finch began to plan to duplicate Amelia Earhart's doomed around-the-world flight, known as World Flight, of 1937. Amelia Earhart was the first female to fly completely over the Atlantic Ocean, the first to fly nonstop across the United States, and the first to fly from Hawaii to the west coast of California. Amelia Earhart attracted the world's attention when she began her global attempt and mourned her when the plane came up missing without a trace. Earhart was lost somewhere in the south Pacific Ocean. Finch's flight marked the 60th anniversary of Earhart's failed effort as well as centennial of her birth. =Preparations= Linda Finch's Electra 10E in 2007 Linda Finch's Electra 10E on tarmac. Grumman Albatross was Finch's emergency and spare parts plane that traveled with her on the flight around the world in 1997. Finch flew a 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E, restored to the specifications of Earhart's Electra 10E plane.Amelia Earhart's Legacy Remembered. Retrieved: June 19, 2008. She believed the flight should be of the same type plane as Earhart's for historical purposes. She searched for three years to acquire the remaining parts from just one of only two such planes in existence, neither flight-worthy. She found it stored in a garage at a small grass strip airport near Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. It had been sitting there for years. Various parts were missing and the wings and engines were taken off and sold. Besides being in pieces, the plane was rusted and corroded. Finch spent a total of $330,000 (most of her savings) to purchase the hulk and haul it back to her hometown in Texas. Pratt & Whitney, the manufacturer of the Wasp radial engines that powered Amelia Earhart's Electra, donated one and a half million dollars to help Finch restore the airplane in March 1995. Pratt & Whitney underwrote the cost of the $4 million flight and the Hartford Courant newspaper was a sponsor. The Electra plane was methodically and meticulously put back together with great attention to original specifications. Pictures of Earhart's plane and original drawings and photographs from Lockheed helped with the restoration. While reconstruction was not complete until 1997, the plane was able to fly in July 1996. Earhart's radio gear was antiquated, however Finch's Electra was designed with the latest state-of-the-art radio navigation. Finch's aircraft was outfitted with weather radar and a Global Positioning System for world navigation and tracking. The fuel tank was increased from 800 pounds to 1,800 pounds for island hopping across the oceans. The National Geographic Society supplied a video camera for the plane. In addition to access to the internet, the plane was outfitted with a fax machine. Although Finch added modern equipment to aid in navigation and communication, it was still a dangerous trip, flying a heavy plane built for short distances () and she had to contend with the loud engine noise and heat from the engine of the vintage plane for 8 to 12 hours a day. Another plane was outfitted with modern communication and navigational equipment to travel alongside Finch. Her team for the flight included Pratt & Whitney employees, two navigators, and a staff dedicated to promotion of the flight. =Recreation of historic flight= Map showing her route in red, at the Oakland Aviation Museum. Display commemorating her flight, at the Oakland Aviation Museum, accompanying map. Finch's recreated flight began from Oakland International Airport at Oakland, California March 17, 1997, 60 years after Amelia Earhart's 1937 around-the-world flight attempt from the same airport. Finch's flight plan was patterned after Amelia Earhart's route. It involved stopping at 36 places in 18 countries. The trip took 73 days and ended May 28 at the Oakland Airport. The trip was 26,000-miles, during which her cruising speed was just 90 miles per hour. She generally flew in increments of 8 to 12 hours at a time. The Electra's cabin was not pressurized and it did not carry oxygen and, like Earhart, Finch flew below for most of the flight. Finch touched down on five continents, mirroring Earhart's route and its stops. She flew a total of 224 hours, visiting 18 counties and making a total of 34 landings. She flew an additional 1,000 miles to drop a single wreath over Howland Island from her aircraft to honor the pioneering aviator. (Amelia Earhart disappeared on her way to Howland Island on July 2, 1937.) Finch's last leg, the longest of the world flight, was made on May 28. It was an estimated 18-hour flight to cover between Hawaii and Oakland, California. At the time of the flight in 1997, Finch was 46 years old, seven years older than Earhart's age on her final flight. =You Can Soar= Finch hoped children around the world would understand Earhart's courage, hope and determination, and find heroes in their own lives - heroes that would teach them to also \\"reach for the sky\\". She tied her flight adventure to the educational series You Can Soar. The flight's purpose was to tell Amelia's message, \\"That you can have your dreams - and they should be big dreams\\". Finch's flight and education programs were supported by Pratt and Whitney. Finch's team and Pratt & Whitney developed a comprehensive free multimedia curriculum which was sent to schools, targeting 5th through 8th-grade students. The curriculum taught geography, time zones, weather gauging, as well as Earhart's legacy. Picking up on the countries that she visited, the cultural studies portion of the program also taught poetry, language, and art. Finch stopped at many places throughout the United States and Europe to meet with groups of admiring school children. The high-tech computer equipment in her aircraft communicated her daily progress to children via the Internet to nearly 200,000 classrooms worldwide. The website was accessed approximately 30 million times in 2 1/2 months. Finch used a laptop in the cockpit of the Electra to communicate details of her journey and answer school children's email messages. =Post- flight= After finishing the historic flight, Finch said to the spectators and media gathered at Oakland International Airport: Finch appeared at numerous aviation-related events, schools, businesses, museums, and children programs, to continue to deliver her message and encourage others to tackle big dreams and make a big difference in our world. The Museum of Flight in Seattle has acquired the Electra. She was honored by the Gathering of Eagles Foundation in 1999. Personal life Finch married three times, all ending in divorce. After her first marriage ended in divorce, she held a number of jobs as a bookkeeper and manager before she married for a second time. She returned to San Antonio, Texas and had her second child, a son, Leslie. Her third marriage was in 1983 to Delos Finch, a businessman that owned a chain of auto repair centers in San Antonio, and it lasted ten years. She has three children: Julie and Leslie (born about 1969 and 1976) and a granddaughter (born about 1995) whom she adopted. She has lived in San Antonio and has owned a 300-acre farm and cattle ranch near Mason, Texas. She converted a 1911 stone chapel there to a house.

It was originally set to be released on December 30, 2008, but was pushed up to October 21, 2008. At the end of the book is an introduction to the novel Outcast, the first novel in the Fate of the Jedi series. Story Much of the novel delves into the long history of the Millennium Falcon, from the time it came off the assembly line to when it was owned by Han Solo. In 19 BBY, during the Clone Wars' Battle of Coruscant, the Falcon was known as the Stellar Envoy and captained by Tobb Jadak and his copilot Reeze Duurmun. Jadak and Duurmun were conspirators in a plot to overthrow Supreme Chancellor Palpatine as leader of the Old Republic. Their mission failed when an erratic hyperspace jump landed the Envoy in an accident killing Duurmun and placing Jadak in a coma that lasted for more than sixty years. By 43 ABY, two years after the end of the Second Galactic Civil War, Jadak awoke, having barely aged since his time in the coma. With the help of Flitcher Poste, they attempt to find out what happened to the Stellar Envoy. Meanwhile, the Solos discover a mysterious object aboard the Falcon, and decide to ascertain the Falcon's origins. They work their way back in time from when Lando Calrissian first owned the ship until they eventually cross paths with Jadak and Poste. Jadak reveals that the mysterious object in the Solos' hands will lead them to a treasure on the world of Tandun III, which was meant to overthrow Palpatine. On their heels is Lestra Oxic, a mysterious businessman who wants the treasure. When all parties arrive on Tandun III, they find that the planet has devastated due to the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. They discover the treasure, but it turns out to be a fake. Oxic then hires Jadak and Poste to help him find the real treasure just as the Solos escape from a collapsing Tandun III. They all make it out in time and the planet explodes with no fatalities. The novel ends with Luke Skywalker calling the Solos to come back to Coruscant as Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala had Luke arrested for lack of action in defeating Jacen Solo during the Second Galactic Civil War.

True polyps are abnormal accumulations of mucous membrane tissue that would normally be shed by the body. The main types of polypoid growths of the gallbladder include cholesterol polyp/cholesterosis, cholesterosis with fibrous dysplasia of gallbladder, adenomyomatosis, hyperplastic cholecystosis, and adenocarcinoma. Signs and symptoms Most polyps do not cause noticeable symptoms. Gallbladder polyps are usually found incidentally when examining the abdomen by ultrasound for other conditions, usually abdominal pain. Pathology Most small polyps (less than 1 cm) are not cancerous and may remain unchanged for years. However, when small polyps occur with other conditions, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, they are less likely to be benign. Larger polyps are more likely to develop into adenocarcinomas. Cholesterolosis is characterized by an outgrowth of the mucosal lining of the gallbladder into fingerlike projections due to the excessive accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides within macrophages in the epithelial lining. These cholesterol polyps account for most benign gallbladder polyps. Adenomyomatosis describes a diseased state of the gallbladder in which the gallbladder wall is excessively thick, due to proliferation of subsurface cellular layer. It is characterized by deep folds into the muscularis propria. Ultrasonography may reveal the thickened gallbladder wall with intramural diverticulae, called Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Diagnosis Ultrasound image of gallbladder polyps measuring 3‚Äì7 mm. Diagnosis is typically by ultrasound or CT imaging. Treatment Most polyps are benign and do not need to be removed. Surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) is recommended when a gallbladder polyp larger than 1 cm is found, even if the person has no symptoms clearly related to the polyp. Laparoscopic surgery is an option for small or solitary polyps. Epidemiology Polypoid lesions of the gallbladder affect approximately 5% of the adult population. The causes are uncertain, but there is a definite correlation with increasing age and the presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis). Most affected individuals do not have symptoms. The gallbladder polyps are detected during abdominal ultrasonography performed for other reasons. The incidence of gallbladder polyps is higher among men than women. The overall prevalence among men of Chinese ancestry is 9.5%, higher than other ethnic types.

Mother Theodore and her companions left the Sisters of Providence of Ruill√©-sur-Loir, France, at the invitation of the Bishop of Vincennes, Indiana, to found the Sisters of Providence in the United States. In 1843, the Indiana congregation became independent of the religious institute in Ruill√©, and the Rules of the Congregation were approved by the Holy See in 1887. More than 5,200 women have entered the Sisters of Providence since 1840.Sisters of Providence Media Kit As of 2014, there were nearly 350 sisters in the institute, roughly 300 of whom live and minister from the motherhouse grounds in Saint Mary-of-the- Woods, Indiana. Other sisters minister in 17 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Asia. Currently, foreign missions are in Asia. Former foreign missions were in Peru and Antigua. Sisters of Providence are designated by the initials \\"SP\\" following their name in print. The congregation is a member of the Women of Providence in Collaboration. Mother Theodore was canonized on October 15, 2006. Her remains are located in her official shrine near the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, as well as a portion buried in the Sisters of Providence Convent Cemetery. History In 1840 at the invitation of Bishop Simon Brut√© of the Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana, the Sisters of Providence of Ruill√©-sur-Loir, France, sent Sister St. Theodore Guerin to open a school and minister to people in the Diocese of Vincennes. She was accompanied by five other sisters: Sister St. Vincent Ferrer (Victoire) Gag√©, Sister Basilide (Josephine) S√©n√©schal, Sister Olympiade (Therese) Boyer, Sister Mary Xavier (Francis Louise) Ler√©e, and Sister Mary Liguori (Louise Frances) Tiercin. Marker on location of first Sisters of Providence motherhouse After a rough journey across the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern United States, the sisters arrived in Saint Mary-of-the- Woods, Indiana, on October 22, 1840. They stayed with a local family, Joseph and Sarah Thralls. (This location is now honored with a historical marker from the Indiana Historical Bureau.) The Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the Woods were established as a separate community than the founding congregation in Ruill√©-sur-Loir. The rules and constitutions received final approval from the Holy See in 1887. =Educational ministry= Educators from the beginning, the sisters began building a school for girls called \\"The Academy\\" in 1840. The first student at the academy arrived for enrollment July 4, 1841. The Academy is now known as Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College and is the oldest Roman Catholic college for women in the United States. As early as 1846, a charter was granted by the State empowering the institution to confer academic honors and collegiate degrees. The sisters soon found themselves in charge of or staffing several local schools, including St. Joseph's Parochial Catholic School, St. Benedict's German Catholic School, and St. Patrick's Day School, all in nearby Terre Haute. As their reputation grew, the Sisters of Providence would eventually staff schools across Indiana. They would also extend their ministry into Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, other states, and the District of Columbia. They have also staffed schools internationally in China, Taiwan, and at Colegio San Jos√© in Arequipa, Peru. =Civil War= In May 1861 the Sisters of Providence were asked to take over the administration of City Hospital in Indianapolis, when measles broke out in the nearby state encampment. The United States Government turned it into a military hospital for the duration of the war. In June 1864, seventy-five Hoosiers from Sherman's army were transferred from hospitals in Louisville and Jeffersonville. The hospital also cared for wounded Confederate soldiers. Under the direction of Mary Cecilia Bailly, the sisters took charge of washing, cooking, and cleaning; several Sisters served as nurses. In a \\"Report of the Surgeons of the Military Hospital\\" to the Inspector General, Doctors John M Kitchen and P.H. Jameson wrote, \\"In conclusion we feel that ... whatever success may have attended the management of the Hospital is due in a great degree to the noble and self-sacrificing efforts of those meek and worthy women ‚Äì the sisters of Providence.\\" A Confederate prison was also located in Indianapolis, which held at one time 7,000 prisoners. According to Colonel Oran Perry of the 69th Regiment of Indiana, \\"It is probable that all the Sisters in the Service in the city here were, at times, on duty in this prison. ... The Sisters were seen everywhere, on the boats, in the barracks, in the streets, always giving the most tender care to the soldiers.\\" After the Battle of Fort Donaldson, the Bishop of Vincennes offered the use of the seminary for the sick and wounded and the assistance of the sisters to care for them. Soldiers of the 19th Illinois Regiment were cared for at this emergency facility. The Sisters also staffed a contagion ward set up at the college at Vincennes. At the end of the war the hospital was returned to the city and the Sisters opened St John's Infirmary for those soldiers with no place to go, but not yet strong enough to travel. =Mission in Asia= The Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods were the first congregation of American women religious to establish a mission in China. Ministry in Kaifeng In the summer of 1919, Bishop Joseph Tacconi of Kaifeng, China, met with Sisters of Providence general superior Mother Mary Cleophas Foley to request sisters for a school for young women in Kaifeng. Sister Marie Gratia Luking led this group of sisters to Kaifeng to open an elementary school and a junior middle school for girls. Luking and her companions arrived in Kaifeng on November 24, 1920. Soon after arriving, the sisters opened a medical dispensary and the Hua Mei School for Girls. The sisters ministered here until 1927 when the Communist army of Mao Zedong reached Kaifeng. The sisters were forced to leave, taking refuge with the Maryknoll Sisters in Korea. In 1929 they returned to Kaifeng and opened an orphanage as well as a novitiate for women wanting to enter religious life. This native congregation, the Providence Sister-Catechists, received papal approval in 1932. Ching I Middle School was opened September 12, 1932. World War II Japan began threatening China by 1935, and air raids, bombings, and attacks by soldiers became commonplace. Kaifeng was bombed March 25, 1938. Soon the school and novitiate became a place of refuge for people seeking safe haven. Though Kaifeng fell to the Japanese June 6, 1938, and life became more difficult for the sisters, they remained in their compound. On December 8, 1941, the sisters' compound in Kaifeng was attacked by Japanese soldiers. The sisters from the United States were forced to relocate to a Baptist mission compound and then a Benedictine Sisters' compound in Kaifeng. On March 22, 1943, the Sisters of Providence and all other U.S. missionaries were interned at the Weihsien Compound, a concentration camp in Shandong. Five months later U.S. internees were again relocated, this time to Peking where they were placed under house arrest with the Spanish Daughters of Jesus. In September 1945 after the war had ended, the sisters returned to Kaifeng and repaired their compound, I Ching School, and the novitiate. However, China was soon politically plagued by internal strife between the Communists and the Nationalists. As the Communist armies advanced to Kaifeng, the United States Consulate General advised U.S. citizens to leave. The sisters spent some time with the Religious of the Sacred Heart in Shanghai. Taiwan As China fell under Communist rule, 23 Sisters of Providence and Providence Sister- Catechists moved to Taiwan, then known as Formosa, and settled in Taichung. Luking and the other sisters began building a new college. The school, now known as Providence University, opened in 1949 and moved to the region of Shalu, Taichung, in 1987. Currently, Sisters of Providence work in multiple ministries in Taiwan. In addition to Providence University, sisters staff multiple facilities for care of children and adults with mental and/or physical disabilities including St. Theresa Opportunity Center in Yucheng, Reed School in Hsinchu, St. Camillus de Lellis Center for the Mentally Challenged in Penghu, and Miracle Place in Taishan. Spirituality According to their mission statement, Sisters of Providence are \\"dedicated to the mission of being God's Providence in the world by committing ourselves to works of love, mercy and justice in service among God's people.\\" Individual sisters are free to worship in their own ways and places of ministry. On the motherhouse grounds of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, the congregation has daily mass available in the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The grounds are also home to numerous shrines and sacred places, including the Blessed Sacrament Chapel, the Saint Anne Shell Chapel, the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, the National Shrine of Our Lady of Providence, and a walking labyrinth. An outdoor set of the stations of the cross leads into the Sisters of Providence Convent Cemetery. Current ministries Sisters of Providence work in the areas of education, health care, peace and justice, social services, and spiritual development. In addition to the individual ministries of its sisters, the congregation funds multiple ministry organizations. =Providence Spirituality & Conference Center= Providence Spirituality & Conference Center is the welcoming center for pilgrims and visitors to the Sisters of Providence at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. It offers retreats and other events. The facility serves as the entrance to the Shrine of Saint Mother Theodore Guerin. Also preserved at the Center is a set of twelve historical dioramas, begun by Henri Marchand and completed by Gregory Kamka. There is also a gift shop, dining services in O'Shaughnessy Dining Hall, and the National Shrine of Our Lady of Providence. =White Violet Center for Eco- Justice= Sr. Morris, keeper of bees, c. 1900 White Violet Center for Eco- Justice focuses on organic agriculture, eco-justice education, spiritual ecology and social advocacy. Founded in 1995, the center maintains a herd of alpacas, of state-certified organic farmland, bees, a berry patch, a farmers' market, classified forest, and orchards. White Violet Center is considered an \\"engaged project\\" by the Yale University Forum on Religion and Ecology.Forum on Religion and Ecology =Guerin Outreach Ministries= Guerin Outreach Ministries is made up of two ministries: Providence Family Services in West Humboldt Park, Chicago, and Providence in the Desert in southern California. These ministries provide adult literacy/GED instruction, tutoring for school- age children, English as a Second Language classes, citizenship classes, music classes, computer literacy classes, and bilingual counseling. Peace and justice The congregation has elected to focus on several social justice issues: women in church/society, eco-justice, racism, nonviolent strategies for peace and disarmament, immigrant rights, and persons living in poverty. Several ministries of the Sisters of Providence address these issues, including White Violet Center for Eco-Justice, Guerin Outreach Ministries, Providence Self Sufficiency Ministries. The Sisters of Providence administer grants to not-for-profit systemic change groups with limited access to other funding through their Poverty and Justice Fund. They are also a founding congregation and sponsoring member of 8th Day Center for Justice, based out of Chicago. =Death penalty and prison reform= Numerous Sisters of Providence participate in prison ministry, visiting and writing to inmates. The General Council of the Sisters of Providence adopted a public stance against the death penalty in 1995 in collaboration with the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. Sisters of Providence plan prayer vigils, write letters to government leaders and provide media relations support for this cause.

The coordinating organization changed its name to \\"Cinema St. Louis\\" in 2003. The festival screens approximately 300 films over a period of 10 days during November. History SLIFF was established in 1992 for the purpose of producing, promoting, and presenting annual film events to advance film as an art form. In its first year, 25 films were shown during the last week of April, to an overall audience of 4,500. In 1993, the Festival incorporated as a Missouri not-for-profit organization, and screened 33 films, with an increase of attendance by 20%. In 1994, the Festival lasted 10 days, with films showing in three theaters, and 11 film directors attended their St. Louis premieres. 1994 also saw the founding of Cinema St. Louis, now known as Friends of the St. Louis International Film Festival, the membership society of the Festival, which contributes financially and provides volunteer support. In 1995, the Festival moved from April to November and grew to include the St. Louis premieres of more than 50 films. Two annual awards were initiated: the juried Fox Theatre First Feature Award and the Audience Choice Award. The fourth year also saw the debut of the Spring Sampler, an April event that included 10 screenings and several visiting filmmakers. A New Filmmakers Forum was introduced in 1996. By 1997, attendance at the Festival had grown to over 10,000. Twenty-eight guest filmmakers attended, and a special feature included an opening weekend Star Tribute to screen legend Tony Curtis at the Fox Theatre, where a Hollywood Film Artist Award was presented.

By marriage she became Duchess of Norfolk. Her abusive marriage to Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, created a public scandal. Family Elizabeth Stafford's father, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham Lady Elizabeth Stafford, born about 1497, was the eldest daughter of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, and Eleanor Percy (d. 1530). Through both parents Elizabeth was a descendant of King Edward III. Her grandparents on her father's side were Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and Lady Katherine Woodville (sister of Elizabeth Woodville), and on her mother's, Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland, and Lady Maud Herbert. Her paternal grandfather, the 2nd Duke, was executed for treason in 1483 by King Richard III, and in 1521 her own father suffered the same fate when he was beheaded on Tower Hill for treason against King Henry VIII. Early life Elizabeth lived at home until at least 1508. According to Harris, Elizabeth's father saw that all his children received some education and her literacy is attested to by the fact that she was termed by the poet John SkeltonHowever Scattergood states that Skelton's patron, mentioned in his Book of the Laurell, was Elizabeth (nee Tilney), Countess of Surrey; . an admirer and friend of the muses and his particular patron.. Elizabeth came to court in 1509 as a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, and became the Queen's lifelong friend.. Marriage Elizabeth Stafford's husband, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk Before 8 January 1513, when she was only fifteen and he was thirty-five years of age, Elizabeth became the second wife of Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey. He was the widower of Anne, daughter of King Edward IV.. Elizabeth had earlier been promised in marriage to her father's ward, Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland. The young Elizabeth and Ralph Neville seem to have been mutually devoted, and years later, in a letter to Thomas Cromwell dated 28 September 1537, Elizabeth recalled that:; ; . > He and I had loved together two years, an my lord my husband had not sent > immediately word after my lady and my lord's first wife was dead, he made > suit to my lord my father, or else I had been married before Christmas to my > Lord of Westmorland'. Elizabeth's father initially attempted to persuade Howard to marry one of his other daughters, but according to Elizabeth, 'He would have none of my sisters, but only me'.; ; . Elizabeth brought Howard a dowry of 2000 marks, and was promised a jointure of 500 marks a year,. although Howard apparently never kept that promise.Elizabeth later stated that Howard 'had but little to take to when he married me first but his lands, and he was always a great player' (gambler); . In her later letters she asserted that she had been a dutiful wife, continuing to serve at court daily 'sixteen years together' while her husband was absent in King Henry VIII's wars, and accompanying him to Ireland when he was posted there in 1520‚Äì22.. She bore him five children,. and according to Graves, as late as 1524, when he became Duke of Norfolk, 'they appeared to be bonded by mutual love'.; . However, in 1527 Norfolk took a mistress, Bess Holland, the daughter of his steward, with whom he lived openly at Kenninghall, and whom the Duchess described variously in her letters as a bawd, a drab, and 'a churl's daughter', 'which was but washer of my nursery eight years'.. It appears the Duchess' anger caused her to exaggerate Bess Holland's inferior social status, as her family were probably minor gentry, and she eventually became a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne Boleyn.; ; . During the long period in which King Henry VIII sought to have his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled, the Duchess remained staunchly loyal to Queen Catherine and antagonistic towards her husband's niece, Anne Boleyn, with whom the King was infatuated. Late in 1530 it was noted that the Duchess was secretly conveying letters to Queen Catherine from Italy concealed in oranges, which the Queen passed on to the Imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys,. and at one time the Duchess told Chapuys that her husband, the Duke, had confided in her that Anne would be 'the ruin of all her family'.. In 1531 the Duchess was exiled from court at Anne Boleyn's request for too freely declaring her loyalty to Catherine.; . According to Graves, the Duchess also quarrelledIn contradiction to Graves, Weir claims that Anne won the Duchess's favour by arranging brilliant matches for Thomas Howard with the daughter of the Earl of Oxford, and for Mary Howard with Henry FitzRoy, and that, appeased, the Duchess stopped plotting the restoration of Queen Catherine, and returned to court; . with Anne over Anne's insistence that the Duchess's daughter, Mary Howard, should marry Henry VIII's illegitimate son, Henry FitzRoy.; . When Anne Boleyn was crowned on 1 June 1533, the Duchess refused to attend the coronation 'from the love she bore to the previous Queen'.; . Meanwhile, the Duchess's own marriage continued to deteriorate. The Duke refused to give up his mistress, and resolved to separate from his wife. Both the Duke and Thomas Cromwell requested the Duchess's brother to take her in, a suggestion he utterly rejected.; . The Duchess wrote of her husband's abuse of her during this period, claiming that when she was recovering after the birth of her daughter, Mary, he had pulled her out of bed by the hair, dragged her through the house, and wounded her with a dagger. In three separate letters to Cromwell the Duchess repeated the accusation that the Duke had 'set his women to bind me till blood came out at my fingers' ends, and pinnacled me, and sat on my breast till I spit blood, and he never punished them'.. Howard responded to the allegations by writing that 'I think the apparent false lies were never contrived by a wife of her husband that she doth daily increase of me'.; ; . Continued cohabitation was clearly impossible, and on 23 March 1534. Howard forced a separation. According to the Duchess, the Duke had ridden all night, and arriving home in a furious temper had locked her in a chamber and taken away all her jewels and apparel.. She was sent to a house in Redbourn, Hertfordshire, from which she wrote a number of letters to Cromwell complaining that she was kept in a state of virtual imprisonment with a meagre annual allowance of only ¬£200.. At first the Duchess attempted to reconcile with her husband, but when she received no reply to her 'kind letters' to the Duke, she declared to Cromwell in a letter dated 30 December 1536 that 'from this day forward I will never sue to the King, nor to none other, to desire my lord my husband to take me again'.. On his part, Norfolk refused to give up Bess Holland, and attempted to persuade the Duchess to agree to a divorce, offering to return her jewels and apparel and give her a great part of his plate and stuff of household, but she rebuffed his offers.. She received little or no support from her family. Her eldest son and daughter became estranged from her,. while her brother condemned her behaviour.; . Forsaken by almost everyone, the Duchess remained obdurate. On 3 March 1539, she wrote to Cromwell that:; . > I am of age to rule myself, as I have done these five years, since my > husband put me away. Seeing that my lord my husband reckoned me to be so > unreasonable, it were better that I kept me away, and keep my own house > still, and trouble no other body. . . I pray you, my lord, take no > displeasure with me, although I have not followed your lordship's good > counsel, and your letters, as touching my lord my husband for to come home > again, which I will never do in my life. Final years Framlingham Church, burial place of Elizabeth Stafford's husband The Duchess's entreaties to Cromwell ceased with his fall from power in 1540. She and her brother were eventually reconciled, and at some time before 1547 he sent one of his daughters to live with her, whom the Duchess treated very generously.. During Henry VIII's last years Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, and Henry's last wife, Catherine Parr, both of whom favoured the reformed faith, gained influence with the King while the conservative Duke of Norfolk became isolated politically. The Duke attempted to form an alliance with the Seymours through a marriage between his widowed daughter, Mary Howard, and Hertford's brother, Thomas Seymour, but the effort was forestalled by the provocative conduct of the Duke's eldest son and heir, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, who had displayed in his own heraldry the royal arms and insignia.. On 12 December 1546 both Norfolk and Surrey were arrested and sent to the Tower. On 12 January 1547 Norfolk acknowledged that he had 'concealed high treason, in keeping secret the false acts of my son, Henry Earl of Surrey, in using the arms of St. Edward the Confessor, which pertain only to kings', and offered his lands to the King. Norfolk's family, including the Duchess, his daughter Mary, and his mistress, Bess Holland, all gave evidence against him. Surrey was beheaded on 19 January 1547, and on 27 January 1547 Norfolk was attainted by statute without trial. The dying King gave his assent to Norfolk's death by royal commissioners, and it was rumoured that he would be executed on the following day. He was saved by the King's death on 28 January and the council's decision not to inaugurate the new reign with bloodshed.; . Norfolk remained in the Tower throughout the reign of King Edward VI. He was released and pardoned by Queen Mary I in 1553, and in Mary's first parliament (October‚ÄìDecember 1553), his statutory attainder was declared void, thereby restoring him to the dukedom. He died at Kenninghall on 25 August 1554, and was buried at St. Michael's Church at Framlingham in Suffolk. The Duchess was not named in his will.. Elizabeth Howard died 30 November 1558 at Lambeth, and was buried in the Howard chapel in the Church of St Mary-at- Lambeth. Her brother wrote a brief but apparently heartfelt epitaph:. Thou wast to me, both far and near, A mother, sister, a friend most dear.

The neighborhood is home to the largest concentration of Jewish residents in Austin, and includes a 40-acre complex housing a number of Jewish community organizations, synagogues, and schools. History David Barrow Sr. and Edward Barrow, along with their associate Chuck Stahl and David Barrow Jr., were responsible for much of Austin's expansion in the flatlands and in the mountain regions during most of the 1950s and 1960s. David Sr. was also primarily responsible for the eventual construction of Texas State Highway Loop 1 (\\"Mopac\\"), the highway that stretches on the east side of the neighborhood. He helped construct Mopac to help the flow of traffic for residents who lived in the northwestern quadrant of the city. Before Mopac was formed in 1966, most Northwest Hills residents had to commute to Lamar Boulevard, or sometimes as far as Interstate 35, to reach downtown, where most of them worked. He ran studies that showed that Austin needed better streets for northwestern residents. The first properties the Barrows bought in Northwest Hills were on Balcones Drive. They then moved to the lands at Mount Bonnell, the ones that overlook the Colorado River, and began to develop properties there. Gradually, they developed lands further into the hills, expanding present-day Northwest Hills. Initially, the Barrows had no intention of expanding into Northwest Hills. They believed, however, that the affluent growth of the city was apt for northwestern Austin, and that if Austin were to ever build an area for that segment of the population, the design would take place in hilly terrains like Northwest Hills. The Barrows thus gradually began buying properties in the area by picking few parcels of land in sparse locations, developing them, and then moving to more rugged lands. Most of the lands in Northwest Hills were owned by M.E. Hart, a Canadian businessman, and a man known as Capitan Knox. The Barrows struck a deal with Hart and agreed to buy the lands from him at a rolling option, meaning that they would buy them in parts and purchase them at market price. Both of them benefited from the agreement since the Barrows did not have the capital to purchase upfront, while Hart sold the properties at an increasing market price since the values of the lands grew due to the neighborhood developments. The Barrows and their associates came to own of the of developed land in northwest Austin by the 1950s. The development of the lands by the Barrows were considered unique for its time. When they put together a design for the neighborhood, they wanted to create a \\"new\\" town while drawing from other developed lands of Austin's core urban area. Balcones Drive, which borders the eastern part of Northwest Hills, was intended to serve as a counterpart to downtown's Colorado River. Far West Boulevard, which traverses Northwest Hills from east to west, was conceived to be comparable to Congress Avenue, the main street in downtown Austin. The developments by the Barrows were also considered unique because of the plan to include a Missouri Pacific Railroad system next to the neighborhood, as well as plans to have Far West Boulevard empty into Airport Boulevard, a main thoroughfare in the southeastern part of Austin. Geography Urban geography = Northwest Hills is located on the northwestern side of Austin. The neighborhood is sometimes referred to as Far West after its main street, Far West Boulevard, which stretches from Mopac on the east and goes deep into the residential homes on the west prior to reaching the Ladera Norte street, close to Capital of Texas Highway. The commercial area between Mopac and Mesa Drive, which intersects with Far West Boulevard, is the biggest commercial area of the neighborhood. The boulevard hosts several local and national businesses, stores, restaurants, apartments, and business offices. The streets adjacent to Far West Boulevard are the most densely populated areas of Northwest Hills.  Architecture and societal structure  Most of the houses in Northwest Hills area feature Colonial, Californian ranch, or Texas Tuscan villa-style architectures. Beyond Mesa Drive, many of the homes have a western Austin style: big family homes with large garages, landscaped yards, and old trees. The common design is brick and limestone. The community is mostly middle and upper-middle class, and is often cited as being \\"upscale\\". Residents are usually quite involved with the community, and they have worked together with the City of Austin on zoning issues to ensure that the neighborhood continues to experience high-quality living standards. Despite being mostly family-residential, the area is also quite popular with college students due to the area's condominiums, townhouses, and apartment complexes. Most of the students live in the lower part of the neighborhood, in streets like Greystone and Wood Hollow, which connect with Far West Boulevard.

It was written by Harry G. Stafford, based on a story by George Bronson Howard. This film was the second in a series of four films called The Adventures of Francois Villon. Lon Chaney was featured in this one, as well as in the first installment, The Oubliette (1914), but did not appear in the other two. The film is now considered to be lost. Plot The King of France, Louis XI, extends an offer of peace to Edward IV of England. King Edward's treacherous advisor, Sir Stephen (Lon Chaney), advises him to reject the offer. King Louis asks Francois Villon for his advice, and Villon tells the king that he should get rid of Sir Stephen once and for all. Villon travels to England to deal with the problem and hires a beautiful young woman (the Lady Eleyne) to seduce Sir Stephen. She lures him to her father's castle where he is made to look like a prowler, and Villon and his men execute him. Villon then returns to France to facilitate the peace treaty, free of Sir Stephen's interference.

Murdock MacQuarrie has the name part and Pauline Bush and Lon Chaney are also in the cast. In this number Villon acts as the emissary of Louis XI, and by his wits succeeds in luring to destruction Sir Stephen, favorite of Edward IV. The atmosphere and costuming are good, and the final scenes dramatic and stirring. Villon appears to advantage in his more poetical aspects. In this incident he is a little too much of the villain. But the prediction is a commendable one, and above the average in general construction.\\" Motion Picture News wrote: \\"The director, Charles Giblyn, has proven himself worthy of great praise. The old costumes and castles, the joviality of the tap-room, the dignified and stately action of the court followers, all lend a decidedly mediaeval atmosphere to the picture...but the picture does not rely solely on its meritorious costumes and atmosphere for success. There is sufficient scheming, brawls, duel scenes and the like to appease the appetites of the keen lovers of sensationalism, and those who would not be content with the great character study that the picture offers.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1914 films Category:1914 short films Category:1914 drama films Category:1914 lost films Category:American films Category:American short films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Lost American films Category:Films directed by Charles Giblyn Category:Films about Fran√ßois Villon Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:American drama films Category:Cultural depictions of Fran√ßois Villon Category:Cultural depictions of Louis XI of France Category:Lost drama films ","title":"The Higher Law (1914 film)"},{"id":"18026319","text":"Monument to Jos√© Azueta in the Plaza de la H.

Jos√© Azueta Abad (May 2, 1895 ‚Äì May 10, 1914), usually known as Jos√© Azueta, was a Mexican Navy lieutenant who became famous for his role in the United States occupation of Veracruz, where he was fatally wounded. He is one of the most revered national heroes in Veracruz. Early life and education Born in Guerrero on May 2, 1895, son to Commodore Manuel Azueta Perillos and Josefa Abad. Due to the labor of his father in military service, the family moved to the port of Veracruz. There he completed basic education in Jos√© Miguel Mac√≠as of Veracruz School where he showed quick progress especially at discipline and behavior. At age 11, his father was promoted to Captain of the ship to the Director of the Naval Academy, at that time, Jose showed his interest and affection for the profession of his father, and in 1909 he began taking classes at the Navy school. At 15, he applied to the Naval Academy and was approved on August 27. The son of Commodore Manuel Azueta, commander of the Veracruz Naval Academy, Lieutenant Azueta was wounded on April 21, 1914, the first day of the invasion. Career Azueta was manning a machine gun placed outside the building, facing the incoming U.S. troops on his own and causing a number of casualties. After having been mortally wounded by U.S. Navy marksman Joseph G. Harner, who took several shots at him from about 300 yards away, he was rescued from the battlefield and taken to his home,.[The Landing at Veracruz:1914, Jack Sweetman, 1968, p.71] After the battle, U.S. Rear Admiral (later Admiral) Frank Friday Fletcher heard of Azueta's actions and sent word to him via messenger that he (Fletcher) wished to visit the fallen defender and pay his respects. Azueta‚Äîthrough his surgeon and local political activist Dr. Roberto Reyes Barreiro‚Äîsent word to Fletcher refusing the visit, saying \\"If the American (Fletcher) enters my house, I will either kill him or me.\\" Fletcher then offered to send his personal doctor to take care of him. However, Azueta refused medical services offered by the occupation army and only allowed local Dr. Rafael Cuervo Xicoy to treat him. Dr. Xicoy lacked medical supplies to assist Azueta properly. At the time of his death, Lt. Azueta was being cared for by the surgeon Reyes Barreiro. On April 24, Lieutenant Azueta was promoted immediately to captain by the President of the Republic for his performance in combat. On April 29, he was awarded a gold medal with the Decoration of the Second U.S. Invasion. Again on May 1, he was issued the 3rd Class Military Merit medal. Azueta died of his wounds on May 10, Mexico's Mother's Day.

In 1983, Knapp began writing a program he called Revolve, meant to improve the rotation of songs for airplay. Previously, music scheduling had been done by hand, as disc jockeys selected a song card from the front of a stack, played the track, and returned the card to the back of the stack to ensure that it was equally rotated with all available songs. With the use of computers, better decisions could be made based on a set of programmable rules. For instance, the rule of artist separation would ensure that two songs by the same artist needed to be separated by a given amount of time. After selling the first copy of MusicMaster to WCXI-FM/Detroit, Knapp rewrote the program for the Radio Shack TRS-80 and then for the IBM PC. By 1985, it was licensed for distribution by Tapscan and sold as MusicScan. When a legal dispute ended A-ware's relationship with Tapscan in 1994, Knapp formed his own company and distributed the program as MusicMaster. In 2001, MusicMaster was ported to Microsoft Windows. Overview The heart of MusicMaster is a music database, which is custom built to the user's specifications. This database can include information such as song title, artist, trivia, and any other information the user needs to identify each song. The users can also add attributes to each song to identify the type, era, tempo, mood and other factors that will be used by MusicMaster to control the flow, balance and mix of the scheduled playlists using scheduling rules. The user creates rules based on these attributes using MusicMaster's Rule Tree system. The user assigns the songs to any number of different categories. These Categories are then requested in specific times and patterns throughout the day using any number of Format Clocks. The Categories allow some songs to rotate, or repeat, more often than others in the library. Usually, the newer and more popular songs are heard more often, while the older established hits are heard less frequently. In addition to scheduling rules, MusicMaster also offers an Optimum Goal Scheduling system that selects the best possible song based on a combination of weighted scores. These scores are a measure of the variance from the calculated ideal music rotation as indicated by the rotational mathematics of the music library and Format Clock assignments. The song closest to \\"perfect\\" is the one selected for airplay in each position on the playlist. Users can export the MusicMaster playlists to files that are compatible with most radio and television automation systems, such as WideOrbit's WO Automation for Radio, as well as many popular media players. The balance and rotation of non-music elements, such as jingles and sweepers, are also controlled by MusicMaster. Users can automatically match sweepers and jingles to specific song attributes such as artist, tempo, or genre. MusicMaster also offers a Nexus Server that allows third-party developers to directly access and update the MusicMaster scheduling intelligence, database, and playlists through their own software systems for real-time synchronization of data.A-Ware Software Has MusicMaster Nexus Server Broadcast software products such as traffic and billing, research analysis and web services may use the Nexus Server to interact directly with a MusicMaster database. In April 2016, MusicMaster introduced MusicMaster CS, a client-server based version of their popular music scheduling system. The complete product line also includes MusicMaster Solo Edition, designed for individual radio stations in small markets, and MusicMaster Personal Edition, perfect for hobby Internet broadcasters, retail background music, and personal entertainment. In September 2016, A-Ware Software relocated to Dallas, Texas. With that move, the corporate name was officially changed to MusicMaster, Inc..

Other compliance areas of concern are those dealing with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 17a-4, NASD 3010, HIPAA, the Data Protection Act, and the Patriot Act. Several large corporations lost significant amounts of money because of their failure to meet these compliance requirements. Morgan Stanley had a $1.45 billion judgment against it and Merrill Lynch was issued a $2.5 million fine because of its inability to reproduce e-mail transmissions. Because of growing concerns of similar repercussions, major corporations are implementing electronic message journaling to meet compliance requirements. Overview A communication system recognizes and identifies any new outgoing or incoming message. It then creates a journal message containing information extracted from the new outgoing or incoming message. The journal message is then processed for storage while the new outgoing or incoming message is processed normally. Then, at a time of audit, reviewers may search and analyze stored journal messages. E-mail journaling is typically done at the mail server. Journal message The journal message contains, at a minimum, the following information: a copy of the content of the actual message, any related metadata such as time, date, and individuals involved in the communication. More information may be included, such as a physical location of the message originator/recipient(s), a computer identifier of the message originator/recipient(s), or a class/category of message. The journal message should maintain the same transport format as the actual message so that existing communication infrastructure can be utilized. For example, an e-mail journaling message will, itself, be an e-mail message containing the journaling information as either attachments or in the body of the journaling message and may be in the MIME format. Design variations and considerations *For real-time journaling, the journal message is sent for further processing at the same time the actual electronic message is being sent. For periodic journaling, the journal message is stored in a secure, local storage area before being archived at the enterprise level on a periodic basis, typically after business hours. The processing of journal messages after their creation also varies. A journal message may be forwarded in real- time directly to an archival and storage system, where any storage system processing may then take over. Alternatively, a journal message may be forwarded in real-time to a journaling mailbox, and then retrieved from the journaling mailbox with periodic extractions to the archival system, where any archival system processing would then take over. *Rule-based selective journaling is also well known and in use. With rule-based selective journaling, electronic messages are journaled only if they pass a specific set of rules created by an administrator, possibly relating to specific senders/recipients, keywords, or subjects of the message. *When a journaling message uses the same transport format as normal communications, the same infrastructure can be used to transport the journaling message to a preferred destination. In such cases, journaling messages should contain an identifier indicating they are a journaling message and not a normal communication. This will prevent journaling loops from occurring when multiple mail servers are in use, as a second mail server might receive the journaling message before it reaches the journaling storage destination. Differences between journaling and archiving Journaling refers to capturing information about an electronic message while it is in transit. Which messages and the kind of information that is captured should be defined by a system administrator or compliance agent. The journaled message should be encrypted and users should not have access to their own journaled message store. Archiving, on the other hand, is primarily dedicated for backing up communications or removing them from their original location to an off-site location. Archiving generally does not occur while the electronic message is in transit and users may have access to their own archived messages. The journaling system may, however, be used as a communication interface to the archival system. ImplementationsMicrosoft Exchange= Microsoft released a journaling feature in service packs for Exchange 2000 and 2003, during 2004. Microsoft's journaling feature uses real-time journaling to a journaling mailbox. The journaling feature uses a rule-based selection to determine whether an e-mail should be journaled. If any of the sender or recipients, even recipients of an expanded distribution list, have their journaling setting enabled, then the e-mail is journaled. =Lotus Domino= IBM originally released a journaling feature in Lotus Domino 6, during 2002. IBM's journaling feature allows for copying every email as it is processed by the mail server to either a local database at the mail server or a dedicated remote database. IBM's journaling feature uses a rule- based selection to determine whether an e-mail should or should not be journaled. If properties about the e-mail match pre-defined administrator rule settings the e-mail will be journaled.

Moreno (born April 10, 1952) is a Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida.  Early life and education  Moreno was born in Caracas, Venezuela, the son of Francisco and R√©jane Moreno. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974 and from the University of Miami School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1978. He served as the inspiration for the character D-Bob in the film Rudy, where he was portrayed by actor Jon Favreau. Moreno and the real Rudy lived in adjacent dorm rooms in 1973. At the University of Miami Law School he met his wife of forty years, Maria Cristina Morales. On March 11, 2014, Moreno observed in remarks delivered to the Spellman-Hoeveler American Inn of Court (a private lawyers association) that Morales graduated first in their class at the University of Miami Law School. Morales is a prominent transactional attorney in Miami. They have three children: Cristina (34), an assistant United States Attorney in Miami; Rick (32), a private investment professional in Miami; and Vicky-Lou (26), a television news producer who is affectionately known by her friends and family as \\"baguette.\\"  Professional career  Moreno was in private practice in Miami from 1978 to 1979. He served as assistant federal public defender in the Office of the United States Public Defender from 1979 to 1981 before returning to private practice in Miami from 1982 to 1986. Moreno served as a judge on the Dade County Court from 1986 to 1987. He served as a judge on the 11th Judicial Circuit Court from 1987 to 1990. In addition to his current post as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, Judge Moreno serves on the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States.  Federal judicial service  Moreno was nominated by George H. W. Bush on June 5, 1990 to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to the seat vacated by Judge Alcee Hastings, who was impeached. He was confirmed by the Senate on July 13, 1990 and received his commission on July 16, 1990. Moreno served as Chief Judge on the court from 2007 to 2014. He assumed senior status on July 17, 2020. He was named as a possible Supreme Court pick by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.  Notable rulings  *In early 2010, Moreno ruled that Danish citizen Camilla Broe should be released after determining that her case has expired. Broe is the first Danish citizen to be extradited to the United States. Moreno was very critical of the prosecution and of the Danish Government's handling of the case. *In 2006, Moreno ruled that the government should not have returned 15 Cuban immigrants that were found \\"standing on the pilings of an abandoned bridge in the Florida Keys.\\" The federal government argued that the bridge \\"was rooted under water and was not United States territory\\" and thus the Wet Foot-Dry Foot Policy did not apply. Moreno ordered the government to make \\"best efforts to help the immigrants return to the United States.\\"Aguayo, Terry. \\"National Briefing  South: Florida: Judge Orders Help For Cubans.\\" New York Times March 1, 2006. *In 2001, Moreno presided over the criminal trial of former Miami city manager Donald Warshaw. Moreno sentenced Warshaw to a year in prison, fined him $30,000, and ordered him to pay $51,000 in restitution after he was convicted of stealing $69,788 from a children's charity.\\"National Briefing  South: Florida: Miami's Ex-City Manager Sentenced.\\" New York Times July 7, 2001. *In 2000 the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation sent Moreno more than 50 lawsuits against various HMOs.\\"Panel Sends 50 H.M.O.

Failed nomination to the Eleventh Circuit  On March 9, 1992, President George H. W. Bush nominated Moreno to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, to replace Paul Roney, who had taken senior status. Bush's previous nominee for the seat, Kenneth Ryskamp, had been defeated by the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. However, the Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee did not take up Moreno's nomination before Bush's presidency ended, and President Bill Clinton chose not to renominate Moreno to the seat after he took office.

Traditional (contact) wafer testing Probing ICs while they are still on the wafer normally requires that contact be made between the automatic test equipment (ATE) and IC. This contact is usually made with some form of mechanical probe. A set of mechanical probes will often be arranged together on a probe card, which is attached to the wafer prober. The wafer is lifted by the wafer prober until metal pads on one or more ICs on the wafer make physical contact with the probes. A certain amount of over-travel is required after the first probe makes contact with the wafer, for two reasons: *to guarantee that all probes have made contact (to account for non-planarity of the wafer) *to break through the thin oxidized layer (if the metal pad is Aluminum) on the pad There are numerous types of mechanical probes available commercially: their shape can be in the form of a cantilever, spring, or membrane, and they can be bent into shape, stamped, or made by microelectromechanical systems processing. Using mechanical probes has certain drawbacks: *mechanical probing can damage the circuits under the probe pad on the IC *repeated probing can damage the probe pad on the IC, making further probing of that IC impossible *the probe card may be damaged from repeated contact, or become contaminated with debris created by contact with the wafer *the probe will act as a circuit and affect the results of the test. For this reason, the tests performed at wafer sort cannot always be identical and as extensive as those performed at the final device test after packaging is complete *since the probe pads are typically on the perimeter of the IC, the IC can soon become pad-limited. Shrinking pad sizes makes design and manufacturing of smaller and more accurate probes a challenge  Non-contact (wireless) wafer testing  Alternatives to mechanical probing of ICs have been explored by various groups (Slupsky, Moore, Scanimetrics, Kuroda). These methods use tiny RF antennae (similar to RFID tags, but on a much smaller scale) to replace both the mechanical probes and the metal probe pads. If the antennae on the probe card and IC are properly aligned, then a transmitter on the probe card can send data wirelessly to the receiver on the IC via RF communication. This method has several advantages: *no damage is done to circuits, pads, nor probe cards *no debris is created *probe pads are no longer required, on the periphery of the IC *wireless probe points can be placed anywhere on the IC, not just on the periphery *repeated probing is possible without damaging the probe points *faster data rates are possible than with mechanical probes *the wafer prober does not have to exert any force on the probe location (in traditional probing this can be a significant amount of force, when hundreds or thousands of probes are used) References Category:Semiconductor device fabrication Category:Cleanroom technology ","title":"Non-contact wafer testing"},{"id":"18026673","text":"WJDF (97.3 FM) was a radio station licensed to serve Orange, Massachusetts.

In 1567, Anne's father died; soon after, her mother remarried, becoming the third wife of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. In September 1567, when Anne was about 10 years old, her mother died during childbirth. After the death of their mother, Anne and her siblings were essentially brought up and educated by their maternal grandmother, Lady Mounteagle, who had formerly been married to Sir James Leyburn. Her mother and grandmother were both devout Catholics, which had a strong influence on her religious beliefs and actions. Growing up, Anne and her siblings were instructed on religion by a Catholic priest. This was an issue because they were under the rule of Queen Elizabeth I, a Protestant monarch. Married life Anne's stepfather, Thomas Howard, eventually obtained the wardship of all the Dacre children. He arranged that George (Francis) was to marry Margaret, the daughter of his second wife. The three Dacre girls were arranged to marry Thomas's three sons: Philip, Thomas, and William. In 1569, it was arranged for Anne to marry Thomas's eldest son, her stepbrother, Philip Howard, the Earl of Surrey, the Duke's heir.White, Micheline.

Anne's stepfather, now her father-in-law, discouraged her Catholic inclinations.Norfolk, Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard. The Lives of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, and Anne Dacre, his wife. London: Hurst and Blackett (1857). They saw little of each other in the early days of their marriage, partly because the earl was a student at Cambridge, and Anne came under the protection of Philip's maternal grandfather, Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel. Following Arundel's death, on 24 February 1580, Anne became the Countess of Arundel. She returned to her husband's London house, where they began to live together, and she gave birth to their two children, Elizabeth and Thomas. Throughout the beginning of their marriage, Anne and Philip moved continually. They moved from \\"Audley End to Arundel House, London, to Nonsuch, with occasional visits to the Charterhouse, then known as Howard House\\". The constant moving occurred for many years until the early 1580s, where they finally settled in Arundel Castle in Sussex where Anne and Philip decided to convert to Roman Catholicism. Religion and conversion As a child, Anne learned from her grandmother \\"a high self esteem and affection for Catholik Religion‚Ä¶ great compassion of sick, or otherwise afflicted persons‚Ä¶ and a great kindness of the Society of Jesus\\".Travitsky, Betty. The Paradise of Women: Writings by Englishwomen of the Renaissance. New York: Columbia UP, 1989. 33. Print. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, laws against Catholicism increased and resulted in harsh punishment by Queen Elizabeth I, who ruled the Protestant Monarch. But despite those laws, both Anne converted to Catholicism in 1582. She was converted at the hands of a Marian priest in her Arundel Castle in Sussex. Once word got out about her conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism, Queen Elizabeth I showed strong disapproval and Anne was put under house arrest in the home of Sir Thomas Shirley.White, Micheline. English Women, Religion, and Textual Production, 1500‚Äì1625. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2011. While under house arrest in Shirley‚Äôs home for one whole year, Anne gave birth to her first child, Elizabeth in 1583. After Anne was released, she reunited with Philip. In 1584, Philip decided to follow in his wife's footsteps and convert to Roman Catholicism as well. After Queen Elizabeth I heard of this information, she ordered Philip to house arrest, just like she did to Anne. However, unlike his wife, Philip tried to escape from his ordered of house arrest and flee to France in 1585. In his attempt to escape, he was caught at sea and held as prisoner in the London Tower. He was condemned to indefinite imprisonment, in addition to a fine of 10,000 pounds. After this, the Queen would not allow Anne to live in London any longer, so she moved to a rental house in Romford, Essex. There, she gave birth to her second child, Thomas Howard, the future 14th Earl of Arundel.Anne Howard profile, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Retrieved 30 November 2011. Unfortunately, Philip was never able to meet his first and only son because he died in the Tower of London on 19 October 1595.Travitsky, Betty. The Paradise of Women: Writings by Englishwomen of the Renaissance. New York: Columbia UP (1989). Widowed life Once declared a widow in 1595, all of Philip's possessions that were supposed to be Anne's were withheld from her. She had to pay off debts and secure an income for her family by selling her land. For a long time, Anne and her two children lived in poverty, hardly able to support themselves. Years later, after struggles of paying off debt and living a hard life, Anne was able to regain the property that was rightfully hers by the inheritance of her dead husband. With these possessions, she was able to give her children, Elizabeth and Thomas, a proper life. She eventually moved back to Carlisle, where she was born and raised. She took a vow of chastity in 1595 after Philip died, and never remarried. She spent her days in church attendance and other religious observances. She had a passion for helping people in need, especially people who were sick. In December 1603 Anthony Standen wrote to the Jesuit Robert Persons about the religion of Anne of Denmark. He hoped the Countess of Arundel and other Catholic women would be able to convert her to Catholicism.Kathleen Lea, 'Sir Antony Standen and Some Anglo-Italian Letters', English Historical Review, 47:87 (July 1932), p. 475 citing TNA SP15/35/119. She died of natural causes on 19 April 1630 at Shifnal Manor, Shropshire, aged 73, and was buried at her former home, Arundel Castle, in Sussex. Literary works Anne Howard wrote many different literary works throughout her lifetime, consisting of letters, poems, and journal entries. She wrote of accounts of her life and that of the earl, her husband. Her writing was a \\"compilation of reminiscences, some of which represent her attempts to recall early stages in her life, while others record the day-to-day life in her household, when she practiced a disciplined and practical piety. Events are overlaid with the emotions that remained with the countess, as in the account 'Of the Queen's hatred towards her'\\". There is evidence of poetry that was written by Anne about her imprisoned and deceased husband. They express the sorrow and \\"submission\\" of her husband, for whom she refers to as \\"my sonne\\". There is also evidence of writing about Anne's grandmother that raised her. All of her poetry was published under her own name.

In addition to her teaching and research responsibilities, she served as Founding Director of the University's Center for Race and Gender (CRG). The CRG is a leading U.S. academic center for the study of intersectionality among gender, race and class social groups and institutions. In June 2008, Professor Glenn was elected President of the 15,000-member American Sociological Association. She served as President-elect during the 2008‚Äì2009 academic year, assumed her presidency at the annual ASA national convention in San Francisco in August 2009, served as President of the Association during the 2009‚Äì2010 year, and continued to serve on the ASA Governing Council as Past-president until August 2011. Her Presidential Address, given at the 2010 meetings in Atlanta, was entitled \\"Constructing Citizenship: Exclusion, Subordination, and Resistance,\\" and was printed as the lead article in the American Sociological Review. Professor Glenn's scholarly work focuses on the dynamics of race, gender, and class in processes of inequality and exclusion. Her early research documented the work and family lives of heretofore neglected women of color in domestic service and women in clerical occupations. This work drew her into historical research on the race and gender structure of local labor markets and the consequences of labor market position on workers, including the forms of resistance available to them. Most recently she has engaged in comparative analysis of race and gender in the construction of labor and citizenship across different regions of the United States. Evelyn Nakano Glenn is author of Issei, Nisei, War Bride (Temple University Press), Unequal Freedom (Harvard University Press, 2002), \\"From Servitude to Service Work\\" (Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society), and Forced to Care: Coercion and Caregiving in America (Harvard University Press, 2010). She is also editor of Mothering (Routledge), and Shades of Difference: Why Skin Color Matters (Stanford University Press, 2009). Additionally, Professor Glenn is the author of many journal articles, reviews, and commentaries. A review of her most recent book, Forced to Care stated, \\"Glenn's prose is concise and elegantly crafted, and despite the complexity of the subject matter, the reader is swept along with the force of the narrative structure.\\" Biography Glenn (a Sansei) was born on August 20, 1940 in Sacramento County, California to Nisei (second-generation) parents Makoto Nakano and Haruye Ito. Glenn and her parents were incarcerated from 1942 to 1945, along with more than 120,000 other Japanese Americans, in concentration camps. Glenn's family was first assigned to live in the horse stables at a race track in Turlock, California, and thereafter was sent to the Gila River camp in the Arizona desert, and then to the Heart Mountain camp in the high country of Wyoming. When her family was released in 1945, they moved to Chicago, where Glenn was raised until the age of 16. The family returned to California and Glenn graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1958. Professor Glenn received her BA in psychology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962. She then went on to receive her PhD from Harvard University. Her first academic position was as Assistant Professor of Sociology at Boston University; she has also taught at Florida State University, Binghamton University, and was a Visiting Professor at the University of Hawaii. She has been at the University of California, Berkeley since 1990. Teaching Glenn has taught a variety of courses having to do with research methods and theory in the social sciences, women and work, the Asian American family, comparative gender systems, race and social structures in the United States, and graduate seminars in gender, race, and class.

An economy version of the Tatra 52, it was replaced in 1933 by the Tatra 75. The car was powered by an ohv air-cooled four-cylinder boxer motor of 1465 cc, positioned at the front, and giving a claimed output of . Power was delivered to the front wheels via a four-speed gear-box. The Tatra 54 featured a central \\"backbone chassis\\" a hallmark of Design Chief Ledwinka: the front axle was supported by a transverse leaf spring while a second transverse leaf spring supported the swing rear axle. Various four- and six-seater saloon bodies were available with two or four doors. During its three-year production run, 1510 Tatra 54s were built. Differences between Tatra 30, Tatra 54 and Tatra 54/30 In the 1930s there was rather gradual evolution of Tatra models rather than sudden revolutionary succession, which is typical for auto manufacturers today. In this sense we can see mid-types, which were typical especially for T30, as the car was in production during the economical crises. Although the initial model of T30 is easily distinguishable from last T54, the interim years of production make it sometimes difficult to differentiate, which type a given car might be. The most visible differences cover: * T54 twodoor looks the same as T30 and T52. The undercarriage is the same as T30 - it has the same front axle, the same gearbox, same rear axle (although with less leaf springs), and the backbone tube is also similar (its length corresponds with given carrossery). The main differentiating characteristic is, that T54 has the bottom edge of the doors at the same height as the sidestep, while T30 has the bottom edge higher than sidestep. There also isn't any steel edge between the bonnet and the front window. * T54/30 twodoor has the same carrossery as the classical T54. The only difference is that it uses the stronger T30 engine. * T54/30 fourdoor has a modified carrossery from Tatra 52. It is a kind of transitional type, as it is a merger of older version of T52 and T52's newer carrossery. The roof itself \\"peaks\\" over the front window. The adjustment of carrossery lacks the third side window as the roof part is mounted directly behind the second doors. The front door remained unchanged, while the rear doors were adjusted by cutting them in a way to follow the line of the rear mudguard (which makes it look alike Tatra 75 fourdoor). This type was made because there was surplus of parts of the T52 \\"transitional\\" model. * T54/30 Ambulance - this car needed long tube and therefore it used the long version of T30's backbone. It had the weaker engine from T54 (probably for its economization). * The first T54s may be liken to the last T12s.

She wrote a poem that was a tribute to her father, \\"Castle Howard\\" in 1732. \\"An Epistle to Mr. Pope\\" One of Ingram‚Äôs most renowned poems is \\"An Epistle to Mr. Pope, Occasioned by his Characters of Women\\" that she wrote in response to Alexander Pope‚Äôs poem \\"Epistle 2.

To argue against Pope‚Äôs differentiation, she creatively alters the rhyming couplet form Pope used to emphasize what both sexes have in common: the love of power.

Lord Irvine served as Governor of Kingston-upon-Hull from 1715 until his death from smallpox in 1721, four years after their marriage. Anne, who had no children with her first husband, traveled by herself to the Netherlands and France in 1730, and in 1736, she became an attendant of the Princess of Wales, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales and, later, mother of King George III. It was not until 1737 that Anne remarried, after sixteen years of widowhood. She married Colonel William Douglas of Kirkness an MP for Kinross- shire, despite the disapproval of her family.

They had one surviving child, Francis. Wyatt was married to Elizabeth Brooke, Lady Wyatt whom he had accused of committing adultery, resulting in their separation. She was later rumoured to have been involved with Henry VIII. Early years Littlecote House, Elizabeth's family home Elizabeth Darrell (sometimes spelt Darell) was the daughter of Sir Edward Darrell of Littlecote, Wiltshire. If she was born circa 1513, she must have been the daughter of Sir Edward's third wife, Alice Flye Stanhope who married him before 1513.Reference: C 146/3638 Description: Grant by Edward Darell, knight, to Charles Somerset, knight, lord Herbert, William Blount, knight, lord Mountjoy, Robert Pointz. knight, Robert Bekensawe, clerk, William Compton, esquire, Thomas Fetyplace, knight, John Fetyplace, esquire, and William Byrd, clerk, of his manor of Knyghton by Chalkebourn, with all the grantor's lands and tenements etc, in Knyghton, to the use of himself and Alice his wife in tail male, and in default of such issu to the use of the said Edward in fee; which manor, with that of Wanborough, forms the jointure of the said Alice; with letter of attorney authorising John Knight and Thomas Sturmy to deliver seisin: Wilts. Endorsed: Names of witnesses to delivery of possession on 20 March in the above year Dated: 26 November, 4 Henry VIII. Note: signed fragment of seal Date: [1512-1513] Held by: The National Archives, Kew Legal status: Public Record(s) Sir Edward was Chamberlain to Catherine of Aragon. Elizabeth was a servant of the Marchioness of Dorset and then afterward, on an unknown date, she became maid of honour to Queen Catherine. Possibly out of loyalty to Katherine or due to her dislike of Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth refused to take the Oath of Supremacy. When Catherine of Aragon died in January 1536, she left Elizabeth a gift of ¬£200 for her future marriage. Thomas Wyatt Around the year 1537, Elizabeth became the mistress of the poet and cousin of the late queen Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503 - 11 October 1542). He was legally married to Elizabeth Brooke, the mother of his son Thomas, although they were separated. Elizabeth bore Sir Thomas three sons: * Henry, who died in early infancy * Francis, born in 1541 and took the surname of Darrell * Edward, whose date of birth is unknown. He may have been born after his father's death. The identity of the Edward Wyatt, who was later executed for his part in the Wyatt's Rebellion of 1554, led by Sir Thomas Wyatt, the younger is unclear. Some sources claim that he was the illegitimate son of Thomas Wyatt the elder and Elizabeth Darrell, while others insist that he was son of Thomas Wyatt the younger. Kenneth Muir in 'The Life and Letters of Sir Thomas Wyatt' , asserts that Elizabeth Darrell was the mistress of Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder and quotes various state papers to support this view. Only Francis is mentioned in Thomas Wyatt the elder's will, although it is possible that Edward may have been born after his father's death. Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder is known to have had an illegitimate daughter, however, the identity of the mother is unknown. Sir Thomas left Elizabeth properties in Dorset. Sir Thomas the Younger transferred Tarrant, Kent to Francis Wyatt in 1542 (or, according to other sources, to Elizabeth in 1544). With the attainder of Sir Thomas the Younger in 1554, those properties held by Elizabeth that would have gone to him on her death, went to the Crown instead. She was in possession of Tintinhull in 1547 but it was occupied by the Crown's tenant, Sir William Petre, in 1556, and papers relating to the lease suggest that Elizabeth had died. The parsonage at Stoke, Somerset was leased to Elizabeth in 1548 and around 1554, at about the same time Mary I seems to have paid Elizabeth a legacy left to her by Queen Catherine of Aragon, Elizabeth married Robert Strode. In popular culture Canadian actress Krystin Pellerin portrayed Darrell in several episodes of The Tudors second season. Her fate is however dramatically altered. Instead of returning to royal service after the death of her mistress, as is historically accurate, Darrell hangs herself from the beams of her mistress's former home. The show is correct however in portraying Darrell's and Wyatt's affair. This is the only known portrayal of Elizabeth Darrell in popular culture. She also appears in Hilary Mantel‚Äôs Wolf Hall trilogy as an attendant of Catherine of Aragon and later of Princess Mary, and in Elizabeth Cook's Lux as she moves from loyalty to Katherine (as it is spelled in the novel) to Wyatt.

Sixty years on, they have become a distinctive part of the London landscape, still looking good and remaining popular with residents and visitors alike.\\" Hannah Parham, the English Heritage Designation Advisor, responded to the 2011 listing decision by adding: ‚ÄúThe estate presents a convincing riposte to criticism that postwar council housing is grey, drab and utilitarian. At Hallfield, the exteriors of each block are treated like works of abstract art ‚Äì some are patterned with a chequerboard of blue and red brickwork; others have a zigzagging screen of white concrete panels. The estate now exists amongst an elite group of 16 listed post-war housing estates in London ‚Äì estates that are successful as places to live and are cared for by their residents.‚Äù CityWest Homes controversy In 2010, a ¬£10 million pound project managed by CityWest Homes ‚Äì Westminster Councils Arms-length management organisation ‚Äì commenced to refurbish the estate. The refurbishment included replacement of 50-year-old windows, as they did not meet the Government's Decent Homes Standard (requiring windows in blocks over six storeys to be replaced after 30 years). However, during 2012 and early in 2013 problems, arose in the project. Hallfield resident Edward Newnham, said it's \\"blind leading the blind. It's just a mockery.\\" Resident James Killeen, said: \\"The problem is with CityWest Homes. They were the managers of the thing and they should have been clearer.\\" On 30 December 2013, after reading a confidential report written by CityWest Homes chief executive officer Nick Barton, Westminster City Council and contractor Essex-based Mulalley reached a compromise agreement to end the contract. Following the controversy, Hallfield estate leaseholders considered taking legal action against CityWest Homes.

The history of the club includes a number of worker's sports and football clubs. __TOC__ History The team was established in 1930 as Sport-Verein Westende Laar and by 1937 was playing as BSG Bergbau Westende Hamborn. That season BSG won promotion out of the Bezirkskreise Niederrhein (II) to the Gauliga Niederrhein, one of sixteen regional first divisions established in the 1933 re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. They earned indifferent results there over the next three seasons and were relegated in 1941. BSG was renamed SV Westende-Laar Hamborn in 1942 and the team returned to first division play.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag They promptly took the division title in 1942‚Äì43 and advanced to the eighth final of the national playoffs where they were badly handled (8:0) by VfR Mannheim.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag After a second-place finish the next season, SV voluntarily withdrew from top-flight competition. They became part of the wartime side Kriegspielgemeinschaft Westende/Schwarz-Wei√ü Hamborn and took part in lower-level competition. During this period Westende made appearances in the opening rounds of the Tschammerpokal tournament (1939, 1941, 1942), predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup). Following the end of World War II, occupying Allied authorities ordered the dissolution of most organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs. The club was re- established in 1945 as SV Westende Beeke and in 1947 merged with its wartime partner SV Schwarz-Wei√ü Hamborn to form SV Schwarz-Wei√ü Westende Hamborn. Schwarz-Wei√ü had merged with SV Bergbau Schacht 4/8 Hamborn in 1933 and after 1937 played as WKG Bergbau 4/8 Hamborn until again taking up the name Schwarz- Wei√ü in 1942. Through the early 50s SW Westende played in the Amateurliga Niederrhein where their best results were a pair of fourth-place finishes. The footballers now compete in the Kreisliga A Duisburg-M√ºlheim-Dinslaken. The club today has a membership of about 650 and departments for badminton, gymnastics, handball, and judo. The club now plays in the tier ten Kreisliga C after relegation from the Kreisliga A in 2011 and the Kreisliga B in 2013.

Background  George M. Bain, Jr. was indicted by a federal criminal grand jury and subsequently convicted for making a false report or statement as cashier of the Exchange National Bank of Norfolk, Virginia under U.S. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 5209. Post conviction, Bain filed a writ of habeas corpus, which the Supreme Court granted.Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 2 (1887). The Supreme Court granted Bain's motion after he produced evidence proving that the criminal grand jury indictment he was arrested under had been changed and was not resubmitted to the grand jury prior to his arrest. The Court found that even though the changes may have been negligible, federal courts lose jurisdiction to even make that determination once an indictment by a grand jury has been changed and not resubmitted.Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 2 (1887) at 9. The grand jury indictment was changed, therefore there was no valid grand jury indictment as required for federal arrests under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Ex parte Bain, 121 U.S. 1, 2 (1887) at 14.  Holding  When an indictment is filed with the court no change can be made in the body of the instrument by order of the court, or by the prosecuting attorney, without a resubmission of the case to the grand jury. Even though a court may deem a change immaterial, it makes no difference. The instrument, as changed, is no longer the indictment of the grand jury which presented it.  Subsequent developments  The U.S. Supreme Court in Bain set a rigid standard for federal law enforcement officials to follow when obtaining a federal grand jury indictment. The Court sent the message that grand jury indictments, as required per the Fifth Amendment, would be held to a strict standard. In Bain, the Court concluded that any change in a grand jury indictment, no matter how mundane, would require resubmission to the grand jury. In 1985, upon returning to the issue of grand jury indictments in the case of United States v. Miller (1985), the Court decided on a somewhat looser interpretation of the Fifth Amendment requirements as set forth in Bain. Now, modifications to a grand jury indictments, if only to reduce charges, make simple changes, or remove text, are allowed.See United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130 (1985). Bain has been overruled in part by United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002).

The climate was unfavorable for crops in 1694 and the summer of 1695 was cold and rainy, followed by an early autumn frost that destroyed the summer crops. Cold conditions continued during 1696, and rain fell throughout the summer. Peasants, orphans and the elderly began to die en masse of starvation and the spring snow-melt of 1697 revealed many corpses. Meanwhile, landlords and merchants exported grain to Finland and Sweden, where crops also had failed. About a fifth of Estonian population (70,000 to 75,000 people) died during the famine in Swedish Estonia, which did not end until 1698.  General climate conditions  The famine occurred in a period known as the Little Ice Age. During the 1690s, climate in Europe was characterised by cold springs and summers. It is generally estimated that temperatures were 1.5 ¬∞C lower during the 1690s than the average during the Little Ice Age. This impacted other countries, France suffered the worst famine since the Middle Ages, ice floes formed in the Thames while Lake Constance and Lake Zurich froze completely over.  Local climate impact  According to the folk stories, these stones in Palmse village were gathered from the fields as a gratitude to local baron von Pahlen, who give out grain for the people during the time of the Great Famine. In the previous years of 1692 to 1694, harvests in Estonia were poor due to the shorter than normal summer growing seasons and longer winters. Seed stocks were reduced as a result. Then in the summer of 1695 excessive rain fell, falling almost constantly from June 24 to September 29. This excess rain destroyed crops and hay as the low-lying land was flooded. This resulted in a shortage of seed for the following autumn and spring sowing seasons. The winter of 1695-96 was extremely cold, however the early spring thaw was short lived when winter conditions returned in March 1696, delaying sowing of the little available seed until the end of May. Heavy rains returned in the summer wrecking the harvest, with only between a fifth and a quarter of the seed planted being harvested. In some areas the crop yield was a little as three percent. By the end of the summer in 1696 many peasants were destitute and hungry, farmhands, servants and even some members of the nobility were reduced to begging. By the autumn famine had taken hold and by October the death rate began to rise. The winter of 1696-97 was so severe that corpses could not be buried until the following spring. Estimatedly 70,000 people ‚Äì one fifth or fourth of Estonian population died during the Great Famine.  Regional impact  The availability of salt, a vital ingredient for preserving meat and fish, was impacted by the colder climate. Portugal, the main source of salt to the Baltic region, was affected by excessive rain making salt production difficult. The shortage of salt meant that meat and fish produces could not be preserved, reducing stockpiles available for consumption. At the time Estonia and Livonia were seen as the granaries of the Swedish Empire and large quantities of grain were shipped to Sweden and Finland. Due to the low status these provinces held in the empire, priority was given to the fulfilment of these export quotas. The Government in Stockholm were slow to react to the developing famine and did not relax their policies until 1697 when it was too late.  Aftermath  Peter the Great cited the inadequate provisioning of Peter's retinue of 250 people and horses as they passed through the province during the famine in 1697 by the Swedish Governor General as one of the main pretexts for declaring war against Sweden in 1700, the Great Northern War.

He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks in a game considered one of the greatest in the history of rugby union. Jones is the only Welsh player to have been part of a team to have beaten the All Blacks in the union and league game and is the second dual-code international rugby player from the Northern Hemisphere. David Jones gained his nickname Tarw (Welsh for bull) from his imposing stature; standing at 6‚Äô1‚Äô‚Äô and weighing almost 16 stone. A collier from Aberaman who later became a policeman before becoming a collier once more, he played club rugby as a forward for Treherbert RFCSmith (1980), pg 136. and then later Aberdare, before switching back to Treherbert. In his later life he was caught in a scandal which saw him banned from rugby union and forced his switch to rugby league. Personal history Jones was born in Tynewydd, a small village in the Rhondda Valley in 1881, to Griffiths Jones and his wife Catherine. Jones was the middle child of five, and like his father before him, became a coal miner. Jones later managed to find employment outside the tough world of mining, becoming a police officer. Reports exist during his period as an officer which help to explain his unconventional character, both on and off the pitch. One story is told that while serving as a police officer in Treherbert he became annoyed with an inspector, Jones reportedly removed his tunic, grabbed hold of the inspector and forcibly ejected him from the station.Richards (1980), p. 109 Another occasion saw him disciplined by the police force for selling raffle tickets while still on duty.Richards (1980), p. 110 After leaving professional rugby Jones became a publican and ran two pubs; the Eagle Hotel in Aberdare, and the Castle Hotel in Treherbert. He would later fight in World War I as a member of the Welsh Guards but was wounded badly at the Battle of the Somme, leaving injuries that affected his health throughout the rest of his life.Smith (1980), p. 163 In 1933 David Jones died in Aberdare, South Wales. Rugby union career Jones was one of a line of players chosen from clubs in the South Wales valleys to bolster the Welsh forward pack. His first international game was at the age of 20 against EnglandDavies (1980), p. 136 after impressing during a trial at Treherbert in 1901Thomas (1979), p. 36 and he would represent Wales on another twelve occasions. Jones was a powerful man with a heavy tackle and was used as an impact player; although recognised as a lock forward his international career saw him play in several positions including one game where he was given the number 8 shirt against Ireland in 1905.Newport Gwent Dragons player profiles Jones was part of a very successful Welsh team and was part of two Triple Crown winning sides. 1905 Wales squad, Jones is back row, central The greatest moment in Jones' international career came in 1905 when he was chosen to face 'The Original' All Blacks in the New Zealanders first tour. The All Blacks had already played 27 games without loss, defeating the best British county and club teams as well as the England, Scottish and Irish national teams. Wales were the present Triple Crown holders and undefeated in the last year and the game was built into a major contest by the press, some going as far as calling it The Game of the Century. Although reported as limping earlier in the week, Jones played his part in a hard fought game, and along with Arthur Harding followed a clear tactical game to give Wales a clear advantage. The All Blacks had proven incredibly strong in their previous games in their scrummage tactics, using seven men instead of the usual eight, but using a wedge formation to force their opponents back and then use the additional man to great advantage when the ball was eventually released. Harding had played the All Blacks earlier in the tour, when he faced them with county side Middlesex, and this insight may have explained the Welsh tactic. The Welsh also used a seven-man scrummage pack, but with Jones and Harding staying mobile behind the pack switching sides to prevent the wedge push. The Welsh would eventually win by the narrowest of margins, 3-0.Rugby Relics website Five days after facing New Zealand for Wales, Jones was selected to face the same touring side as part of the Glamorgan County team. The county team was poorly represented, as several players from the victorious Wales team had promised to play but eventually dropped out, until only Jones, Will Joseph and Jack Williams remained. The team played well, with some excellent play from Cardiff's Reggie Gibbs. Jones himself was at the centre of two excellent moves; winning a line out and then placing an overhead punt, which Billy Pullen failed to handle correctly at the try line; and his own charge to the line which was just brought short of a try.Billot (1972), pg 35. Glamorgan eventually lost three tries to nil. Jones would play his last rugby union game for Wales against South Africa in 1906. As part of the Glamorgan County side, Jones had played very well in the team's narrow defeat by the South Africans; but in the international he looked tired and ragged, and his normal excellent scrummaging was poor. He retired from the field early, his Wales union career over at the age of just 25. =International rugby union matches= WalesSmith (1980), pg 467. * 1902, 1903, 1905, 1906 * 1902, 1903, 1905 * 1905 * 1902, 1903, 1905, 1906 * 1906 =Rugby scandal= After Jones' international career he would find himself caught up in a scandal surrounding professionalism. Jones was thought to have returned to Treherbert after his weekly payment from Aberdare was cut from 10 to 5 shillings. An ex-secretary of Aberdare told the press that Jones had received payment from the club, which was against amateur union rules. In 1907, after an investigation from the Welsh Rugby Union, Jones was banned from playing rugby union for life.Smith (1980), pg 180. Dual rugby code international After being banned from playing under union rules, Jones joined professional league team Merthyr Tydfil RLFC, and made national representative appearances for Wales in rugby league. His appearance in the first ever full international played against a visiting southern hemisphere side - the New Year's Day 1908 Test against the All Golds at Aberdare saw him become Wales', and the Northern Hemisphere's second dual-code rugby international, just three years after fellow Rhondda player Jack Rhapps. Played on a near frozen pitch, the game was a close match, with Jones scoring a try just minutes before the final whistle, which gave Wales the victory.Haynes (2007), pg 142. This result made Jones the first player to play in winning teams against New Zealand under both league and union codes. On 25 January, just over three weeks later, Jones faced the New Zealand All Golds again, this time representing the Great Britain team.Haynes (2007), pg 146. Jones was the only representative from a Welsh club in the British team, with the game played at Headingley in Leeds. The British were victorious, 14-6, and Jones was reselected for the second test against the New Zealand team on 8 February. Great Britain lost the second test, and Jones was not a part of the British team for the third and final test. Jones finished his international rugby league career just a few months later when he represented Wales for a second and final time in a 35-18 win over England.

History  The River Tyne at Wylam has been forded for a very long time but because of the industrial revolution in Great Britain, a more suitable method of crossing the river at this point was required to link the ironworks on the north bank with the railway on the south bank so that goods could be taken to Newcastle upon Tyne and other parts of the country. At this time there was a waggonway on the north bank but it only went as far as Lemington. In 1836 a bridge was built over the river constructed from timber sections supported on stone piers, carrying road traffic and a waggonway. In 1897 the bridge ceased to be used for carrying the waggonway because of the construction of Wylam Railway Bridge. In the same year, the bridge was strengthened by being reconstructed using steel. A couple of years later in 1899, a new toll house was built on the north side of the bridge, although the original toll house on the south side still stood up until 1960. The toll for pedestrians to cross the bridge was one penny but in 1936 an opposition to the tolls led to the bridge being acquired by Northumberland County Council. The bridge was strengthened again during World War II in 1942 so that tanks and other heavy military vehicles could use it. Improvements to the bridge continued in the 1950s when two piers were replaced because of erosion and in 1959 when the bridge was widened to . Improvements continued as recently as 2007 when the railings were strengthened following a fatal car crash in which three people died.

It is a double album, and a companion music video DVD was also released in 2001. In All Languages' first disc acts as a greatest hits collection spanning from Godflesh's 1988 self-titled EP to their 1999 studio album, Us and Them. The second disc compiles rare and unreleased tracks. Background and content In All Languages was released on 24 July 2001, thirteen years after the formation of Godflesh. Godflesh would disband one year later, only to reform in 2010. The first disc of the album primarily features tracks from previous albums (\\"Like Rats\\", \\"Xnoybis\\", \\"Frail\\", \\"The Internal\\"), although songs from the group's EPs do hold a presence, such as \\"Avalanche Master Song\\" and \\"Slateman\\". Disc two is a collection of more obscure songs, featuring B-sides, extended mixes, and two tracks from the band's BBC session. Two songs from the never-released Us and Them in Dub remix album also appear on the second disc. The day of the release of In All Languages, a music video DVD of the same name was also released. It features videos for \\"Crush My Soul\\", \\"Mothra\\", \\"Slavestate\\", \\"Christbait Rising\\" and \\"Avalanche Master Song\\". In a 2009 retrospective interview, Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick proved dissatisfied with In All Languages, saying, \\"[it] didn‚Äôt succeed too well. I was still learning about self-mastering at that time. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was satisfied at all with the results a short time after and since.\\" Critical reception Eduardo Rivadavia from AllMusic called In All Languages a \\"near- perfect career synthesis\\". He praised the inclusion of the tracks of the second disc which, according to him, \\"become especially relevant for a full appreciation of the band\\" and are \\"[a] great place to start discovering Godflesh\\". His only regret was the fact that it couldn't feature songs from the band's then-forthcoming record, Hymns (2001). Track listing All lyrics written by Justin Broadrick and G.C. Green. DVD Alongside the CD, In All Languages was accompanied with a separate DVD release featuring the same artwork. The DVD version is composed of the band's five music videos, most of which were not previously available to the public. Inside the DVD is a user manual explaining the band's direct involvement with and approval of all the videos. =Music videos= Unlike the other videos featured on In All Languages, \\"Avalanche Master Song\\" was created by three fans: Jack Sargent, Julian Weaver, and Stephanie Watson. After following the band Head of David, Sargent, Weaver and Watson decided pursue the drummer's, Broadrick's, career and film various shows of his new project, Godflesh. The video comprises these bootleg recordings interspersed with heavily distorted shots of industrial machinery. The live footage is the earliest known of Godflesh performing, as it was taken from their first public show in Brixton, London. The music video for \\"Christbait Rising\\" is a compilation of live recordings from the band's 1989 tour opening for Loop. The music being performed does not match up with the track itself. The audio fades out, cutting away a minute and a half of the song. Robert Garfield directed the music video for \\"Slavestate\\" in Hyde Park, London. Released in 1991, the video is abstract and features a number of distorted shots of Broadrick and previous Godflesh album covers. Barry Maguire directed the music video for \\"Mothra\\" in 1992. It combines shots of the band performing in a rundown disco with strange images of animals and suited men. Godflesh's most noteworthy video is for their song \\"Crush My Soul.\\" It was directed by Andres Serrano and garnered some controversy for its portrayal of violence and religious imagery. =Track listing=Personnel *Justin Broadrick ‚Äì guitar, vocals, programming, samples, production, remastering *G.

He was a member of the House of Lords, and a Chamberlain to King Henry VIII's daughter, Mary I of England. Early years Hussey was born in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England, son of Sir William Hussey, an English judge and Chief Justice of the King's Bench. His mother was the former Elizabeth Berkeley. Hussey's siblings included Sir Robert Hussey (d. 1546), the father of Elizabeth Hussey, the 'Mistress Crane' at whose home at East Molesey the first of the Marprelate tracts, Martin's Epistle, was printed in October 1588; Elizabeth Hussey, who married Richard Grey, 3rd Earl of Kent; and Mary Hussey, who married William Willoughby, 11th Baron Willoughby de Eresby. In 1497, at the Battle of Blackheath, Hussey was knighted. Six years later, he was made \\"Knight of the Body\\", bodyguard to King Henry VII, followed by an appointment as \\"Master of Lyfield Forest\\", Rutland in 1505 and Comptroller of the Household in 1509. On 16 August 1513, at Tournai, after the Battle of the Spurs, he and his brother William were promoted to Knights Banneret by Henry VIII. Career In 1493 Hussey was appointed Sheriff of Lincolnshire and by 1513 he was custos rotulorum for the county. In June 1520 he travelled to France to take part in the Field of the Cloth of Gold meeting between Henry VIII and Francis I, King of France. On 6 July 1523, he was elected Member of Parliament as a knight of the shire for Lincolnshire. Three years later, 5 February 1526, he was appointed a judge. He was created Lord Hussey, of Sleaford, by King Henry VIII in 1529. On 3 November 1529 he was re- elected to Parliament as knight of the shire for Lincolnshire but received a Writs of Summons on 1 December 1529 to the House of Lords as 'Johannes Hussey de sleford, chivaler'. In June 1530, Hussey was named Lincolnshire Castle's Commissioner for Gaol Delivery, and later that same year, Hussey sold some of his large holdings (the Somersetshire manors of Batheaston, Bathampton, Bathford, Twerton; the Wiltshire manors of Compton Bassett, Comerwell, and North Wraxall).\\"Medieval Deeds of Bath and District\\" Henry VIII \\"lodged\\" at Hussey's Sleaford estate where he held court the next morning before venturing to York to meet with the King of Scotland. On 10 September 1533, Lord Hussey attended the christening of Elizabeth, daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and carried the canopy over the three-day old child with George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford, Lord Thomas Howard, and William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. Hussey was Chamberlain to King Henry's daughter, Mary, while Hussey's second wife, Lady Anne, was one of Mary's attendants. Though King Henry forbade anyone from calling his daughter, Mary, by the title of Princess, Lady Anne did do so, after which she lost her attendant position around June 1534 and was imprisoned in the Tower of London in August. Asking for the King's pardon, she was released before the end of the year. In addition to his responsibilities at Court and Parliament, Hussey was steward to John Longland, the conservative Bishop of Lincoln, and King Henry's confessor. Downfall Hussey Tower: The ruins of Lord Hussey's medieval manor house ‚Äì Hussey Tower ‚Äì are all that is left following the orders of King Henry VIII to destroy it. Hussey was implicated along with his cousin Lord Darcy as complicit in the 1536 uprising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Though Hussey denied participation in the rebellion, he was accused of conspiring to change laws and depose the king, and that he abetted those who made war on the king in October 1536. The charges may have been levied in part because of Hussey's Catholic sympathies,Hoyle 2001:159 and because Hussey and his wife, having served 'Princess' Mary, were partisans on her behalf.Hoyle 2001:67 Hussey was indicted and tried for treason, and found guilty by the House of Lords. He was beheaded in Lincoln in 1536, while his cousin, Thomas Darcy, was executed on Tower Hill. Hussey's statement (\\"confession\\") survives.Hoyle 2001:25 Family John Hussey firstly married Margaret Barr (n√©e Blount), widow of Sir John Barr and daughter of Sir Simon Blount, around 1492 at Keynsham, Gloucestershire, by whom he had issue: * Sir William Hussey (c. 1493 ‚Äì 19 January 1556) * Thomas Hussey (c. 1495) * Gilbert Hussey (c. 1499) John Hussey secondly married Lady Anne Grey in 1509 at Sleaford, Lincolnshire. According to historian Sir William Dugdale, in the documents written by Hussey, shortly before his death in 1537, he speaks of his wife as 'Anne'. She was the daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent ‚Äì by his second wife, Catherine Herbert. Lady Anne's paternal grandmother was Lady Katherine Percy, the great-great-granddaughter of King Edward III of England. John Hussey and Lady Anne Grey had issue, including: * Sir Giles Hussey (c. 1495/1505) ‚Äì Knighted by the Earl of Surrey at the Sacking of Morlaix in France in 1522, who married Jane Pigot, and had issue. * Elizabeth Hussey (c. 1497) * Reginald Hussey (c. 1501) * Thomas Hussey * Joan Hussey, wife of Sir Roger Forster. * Elizabeth Hussey, second wife of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, Warwickshire (d. 1586), and had four daughters and two sons. * Bridget Hussey (c. 1526 ‚Äì 13 January 1600/1601), married successively: Sir Richard Morrison of Cashiobury, Hertfordshire (d. 17 March 1556); Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland before 1563; and Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford on 25 June 1566, as his second wife, and had no issue. * Anne (or Agnes) Hussey, married to Sir Humphrey Browne, Justice of the Common Pleas, by whom she was the mother of Christian Browne, wife of Sir John Tufton, 1st Baronet. * Dorothy Hussey * Mary Hussey After his execution, Hussey's home in Sleaford, as well as his other estates, were confiscated by the crown. In 1563, his children were restored to Parliament during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but Hussey's title was forfeited, and the estates were not returned. Claim of Hussey Barony Lord Hussey's brother ‚Äì Sir Robert Hussey and his son Sir Charles Hussey ‚Äì adapted to the political requirements of the recently established Church of England; both serving in the office of sheriff. However, the descendants of the anti-Church of England Lord Hussey, whose barony and estates were forfeited, were left in far less secure positions, both regarding their financial and social status; by 1633, the descendants of Lord Hussey's son, Sir Giles Hussey, had left England to freely practice their non-conformist religion in New England.

It combines traditional pop rock with classical instruments such as the piano. It is Elliot Minor's fifth overall single and comes from their self-titled debut album. The song debuted at 47 on the UK Charts on 5 July 2008.Song detail at Official Charts Company It dropped out of the top 100 the week after. The music was written by Alex Davies, and the lyrics by Alex and Ed Minton. The song was written during the time that the band was trying to get signed. They sent out hundreds of demos and heard nothing back, and the song was born out of their feelings of frustration and being trapped doing the same thing over and over again. Music video The video shows Alex Davies (lead vocals, guitar) repeating the same day over and over again in which he tries to win back an ex-girlfriend. He walks past Ali Paul (keyboards), who is playing his keyboard on the street for money. Ed Hetherton (bass), dressed as a businessman, walks ahead of Alex and throws his coffee cup over his shoulder, hitting Alex. Alex then bumps into Ed Minton (vocals, guitar) on the street. Dan Hetherton (drums, backing vocals), dressed as a floral delivery worker, drops a bouquet of flowers, and Alex walks by without helping him. Alex reaches his destination, a store, where he tries to woo his ex-girlfriend, who works at the cash register. She quickly shoots him down. The day then begins a second time, and all the events stay the same until Dan's scene. Instead of walking past him, Alex stops and takes a single rose from the dropped bouquet, and presents it to the cashier. She remains skeptical and still shoots him down, but smiles as Alex leaves. The third day begins and this time Alex pays Ali for his jacket as he walks by, catches Ed's Hetherton's discarded coffee cup, sidesteps Ed Minton instead of bumping into him, and takes a full bouquet of roses from Dan. He presents the flowers to the girl and they kiss as the song ends.

A quest for wisdom led him, as a young man, to travel out to the Far East. In Bali, in 1939, he found the echoes of a still authentic traditional world that sparked a lifelong encounter with ancient traditions, which he approached through the metaphysical perspectives of Platonism and Vedanta. He spent several decades abroad, living first in Giza, Egypt, where he met and frequented the French metaphysician Ren√© Gu√©non, and later in Lausanne, Switzerland where he became a close associate of the German metaphysician and mystic, Frithjof Schuon. In 1980, he moved to Bloomington, Indiana where he resided for the last 25 years of his life. He died on November 18, 2005. A Treasury of Traditional Wisdom Perry's masterwork, A Treasury of Traditional Wisdom (1971, reedited twice), is a testament to his contacts and personal ties with representatives of Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Sufism, and, not least, with Native American Indians. This opus is a true Summa of the Philosophia perennis, namely a harvesting of the timeless spiritual wisdom culled from every major tradition in the world. Perennialism Perry‚Äôs commitment to traditional philosophy of the East and West led him, in 1946, to make the acquaintance of Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, who, over many years, had established his reputation as the leading authority on the arts of India and Indonesia, as well as on the religions of which these arts were the expression. In the later part of his life, Coomaraswamy came under the influence of Ren√© Gu√©non, the French philosopher and orientalist who was the founder (together with Frithjof Schuon) of what came to be known as the ‚Äútraditionalist‚Äù or Perennialist school of thought. Coomaraswamy became a powerful advocate of that school, and he introduced Perry to the writings of the two founding authors. Thus it was that the Perennial Philosophy, especially as expounded by Schuon, became the guiding star of Perry‚Äôs life. Perry was one of the very few people who was personally acquainted with all four of the leading figures of the traditionalist school: Ren√© Gu√©non and Frithjof Schuon (the two originators) and Ananda Coomaraswamy and Titus Burckhardt (the two continuators). Titus Burckhardt was Schuon‚Äôs closest friend and collaborator, and he too lived in Lausanne. Travels Whitall and Barbara Perry accompanied Frithjof Schuon and his wife on many journeys. They visited the Absaroka and Lakota (Crow and Sioux Indians) in the American West in 1963 and, amongst other things, attended an Absaroka Sun dance; the famous House of the Virgin, at Ephesus, Turkey, in 1968; Morocco on several occasions in the 1960s and 1970s, and also many European countries, including Spain, Italy, Greece, and England (the last-named almost annually). When, in 1980, Frithjof Schuon left Lausanne and retired to Bloomington, Indiana, the Perrys followed suit. Personality and other works Visible in Perry's writings was a strong and incisive manner, but underneath this lay much empathy and compassion, with a healthy sense of humor. For instance, the article entitled ‚ÄúThe Coming of Coriolanus\\" (Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 9, No. 4, Autumn, 1975), reveals his severity, while his humor comes to the fore in ‚ÄúThe Dragon that swallowed Saint George‚Äù (Studies in Comparative Religion, Vol. 10, No. 3., Summer, 1976), an article deriding the second Vatican Council. Ideas he considered misguided were constant targets of Perry‚Äôs writing. In his book Gurdjieff in the light of tradition (1978), a study containing considerable information, Perry argues in detail against the pretensions of those he perceives as pseudo-gurus. And in Challenges to a Secular Society (1996), among other tasks, he counters Aldous Huxley‚Äôs writings extolling the allegedly ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù effects of psychedelic drugs.

In 1752 he was called to assist prof. Knud Leem in his work on a Sami dictionary while simultaneously studying at the Trondheim Cathedral School. Porsanger completed his theological education in Copenhagen 1761, and the same year he was appointed a missionary to Varanger. In 1764 he returned to Trondheim to give further assistance to prof. Leem while also serving as hospital priest. In 1769 he was called by the College of Mission to Copenhagen to give a response to a suggestion from the Hungarian Jesuit scientist-priest Sajnovics that the Hungarian alphabet should be used when writing in Sami. Sajnovics and astronomer Maximilian Hell visited Vads√∏ in 1769 in order to observe the Venus transit. During the visit they discovered that Sami had the same linguistic roots as the Hungarian language. Porsanger agreed with Sajnovics on the use of the Hungarian alphabet while prof. Leem disagreed. During Porsanger‚Äôs stay in Copenhagen he was appointed a resident chaplain at the Cathedral in Trondheim. This appointment was not well received locally, and the church made efforts to give him another position, and in 1771 he was appointed priest to Vads√∏. Porsanger‚Äôs mother tongue was Sami and he translated several parts of the Bible into the Sami language, most of which he burned after having been forced to give up his residency in Trondheim. Porsanger died on trip to Copenhagen to apply for a new position in the Church. Along with his family he drowned in a shipwreck near the town of Ris√∏r and was buried there.

Transposition of accent  Transposing the accent to the first syllable distinguishes ŒßœÅ·º∞œÉœÑŒøœÇ (Christos), the common name, from ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ, Jesus Christ. Similarly the given name Stavros (Œ£œÑŒ±œçœÅŒøœÇ, St√°vros) has the stress on the first syllable, differentiating it from œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ (stavr√≥s), the Christian cross. Constantine P. Cavafy gave two reasons for the transposition of the accent in the name \\"Christos\\": firstly, the rule of transposition of the accent from the final syllable to the immediately preceding syllable in ancient adjectives when they become proper nouns, \\"and secondly, the pious practice of differentiating in appearance from the divine epithet\\". Cavafy gave other anthropological examples of the need felt to distinguish between the \\"sacred\\" and the \\"profane\\", and university professor Giorgos Veloudis added tŒø Cavafy's examples the distinction between the \\"profane\\" word Œ£œÑŒ±œçœÅŒøœÇ (the name \\"Stavros\\") and the \\"sacred\\" word œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ (\\"cross\\").Giorgos Veloudis, \\"ŒóŒæŒµœÅŒµ Œø ŒöŒ±Œ≤Œ¨œÜŒ∑œÇ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨;\\" in Œ§Œø Œí·º†ŒºŒ±, 3 March 2017 (access date: 3 March 2017) Veloudis also mentioned the reverse process whereby Christians have treated as \\"profane\\" the names of pre-Christian divinities such as Hermes, Artemis, Athena, Aphrodite, names used today by Greek-speakers.

Of all the state railway locomotives, these engines are remarkable because they were made over a period of almost 25 years, even during the Deutsche Reichsbahn era. A total of 159 units were manufactured, more than all the other state railway Pacifics taken together. 89 of these locomotives (Series a to i) were built for the Royal Bavarian State Railways and 70 (Series k to o) for the Deutsche Reichsbahn.  Common features  The S 3/6, designed by the Maffei company under the leadership of engineers Anton Hammel und Heinrich Leppla, was a development of the first German Pacific, the somewhat smaller Baden IV f. Like its forerunner, the S 3/6 had a four- cylinder compound running gear with single-axle drive on the second coupled axle. With the exception of series d and e, that had a coupled wheel diameter of 2,000 mm, the S 3/6 had a coupled wheel diameter of 1,870 mm, that allowed it to be deployed both in hilly terrain as well as on the plains. The permitted top speed of the locomotives was 120 km/h, regardless of the driving wheel diameter. Its performance increased during its production lifetime from  Royal Bavarian State Railways  Series a to c = Between 1908 and 1911, 23 locomotives were produced. They had a driving wheel diameter 1,870 mm and were coupled to 2'2' T 26,2 tenders. = Series d and e = In 1912, 18 series d and e machines were produced, with a 2,000 mm driving wheel diameter. They were intended specifically for express train service on the relatively flat routes between Munich and Nuremberg as well as between Munich and W√ºrzburg. Unlike the other locomotives, both high- and low-pressure cylinders had the same piston stroke. Although they were clearly intended for express services, these locomotives were not given a streamlined driver's cab. One of the locomotives, number 3634 (18 451) is preserved and is housed in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. A larger tender, the 2'2 T 32, was developed for series d and e. = Series f = There were only three locomotives in series f built in 1913. They were not significantly different from those of series a to c. = Series g = The torso of no. 18 427 at the Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum (to 2010) In 1914, 10 locomotives were built for the Palatinate (Pfalz) network. They differed from previous engines in several of their dimensions. For example, they were about 150 mm shorter, in order to fit on the 19 m turntables there. These locomotives were given the numbers 18 425 to 18 434 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. One remained in the Soviet Zone of Occupation after the Second World War and did not return to the west until 1948, when it was exchanged for a Baden IV h, number 18 314. = Series h and i = During World War I, from 1914 to 1918, 35 more locomotives were produced. They were the last S 3/6 engines built for the Royal Bavarian State Railways.  Deutsche Reichsbahn  19 vehicles - including some brand new engines - had to be handed over to France and Belgium under the terms of the Armistice; the remainder went to the Deutsche Reichsbahn who gave them operating numbers 18 401 - 18 434, 18 441 - 18 458 and 18 461 - 18 478 in 1926. The S 3/6 became especially well-known through its use as motive power for the Rheingold Express. = Series k = The preserved series k Bavarian S 3/6 built by the Deutsche Reichsbahn - number 018 505-8 Because standard locomotives had still not been built, the Reichsbahn continued to produce the proven S 3/6. In 1923 and 1924 Maffei supplied the series k with a total of 30 engines. They were given operating numbers 18 479 to 18 508. They differed from the earlier series: technically, because of a somewhat larger superheater, and optically, with a driver's cab without a Windschneide, but whose side walls were angled in the area of the windows as on the later standard locomotives. Several were supplied to the Wiesbaden engine shed in order to haul the 'FD' long-distance express train, the Rheingold. Locomotive 18 505 is in the railway museum of the German Railway History Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Eisenbahngeschichte e. V. or DGEG) in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe on the 'wine route' where it can be viewed. The last of these engines, no. 18 508, is in private ownership and stabled in Switzerland. (Locorama Romanshorn). = Series l, m, n and o = Because the production of standard locomotives was not envisaged in the first numbering plan and because the upgrade of main lines to 20 tons was proceeding very slowly, the Deutsche Reichsbahn ordered more Class S 3/6 locomotives from Maffei. In 1927, 12 units of series l were delivered (18 509‚Äì520); in 1927/28 they were followed by 8 engines of series m (18 521‚Äì528). Compared with series k, the superheater was somewhat larger again; in addition, the diameter of the high-pressure cylinder was increased from 425 mm to 440 mm. Several series m locomotives were supplied to Wiesbaden shed in order to haul important trains. Of the 20 planned locomotives of series n, Maffei could only deliver 2 engines (18 529 and 530) before it went bankrupt. Henschel took over the order and supplied the rest of the 18 engines in 1930/31 as series o (18 531‚Äì548). The last 11 locos of this series were given a newly developed tender with the designation 2'2' T 31.7. No. 18 528 is preserved and stood as a memorial in front of the HQ building of the former Krauss-Maffei company in Munich. The locomotive is now in a shelter in the grounds of the Allach factory, following the takeover of the former Krauss Maffei Transport Technology by Siemens, and is not accessible to the public.  Deutsche Bundesbahn  Erbach in 1958. In the 1950s a large part of the Deutsche Bundesbahn's vehicle fleet underwent modernisation. As a result, 30 Class 18.5 engines were rebuilt by the firms of Krauss-Maffei and Henschel. These were the series l to o locomotives built for the Reichsbahn between 1927 and 1930. These units were given a newly developed replacement boiler with combustion chamber at the Ingolstadt and Munich-Freimann repair sheds by the Minden engine shed and Krauss-Maffei. In addition the locomotives were given a new driver's cab and multiple-valve superheated steam regulator. Further planned modifications, such as new cylinder blocks, were not carried out. The rebuilt locomotives placed in service between 1953 and 1957 were given the new operating numbers 18 601‚Äì630 and were used in express train services, where they almost matched the Class 01 in their performance. They were stationed in the engine sheds of Darmstadt, Hof, Regensburg, Nuremberg Main, Lindau and Ulm. Although the modernised locomotives were very powerful and the most economical steam engines in the Deutsche Bundesbahn fleet, they were all withdrawn from service between 1961 and 1965. The reason was that, during the rebuild the pump mounting had been directly welded to the boiler which had led to the formation of cracks. The boiler pressure had therefore to be reduced from 16 to 14 bar, which meant the locomotives lost a considerable amount of power. The last locomotives (18 622 and 18 630) were taken out of service in 1965 in Lindau and scrapped in 1966. By contrast number 18 612 is preserved in the German Steam Locomotive Museum (Deutsches Dampflokomotiv-Museum) where it can be viewed. The unmodified S 3/6 engines were all withdrawn by 1962, apart from 18 505. This was still in service until 1967 with the LVA Minden and was not paid off until 1969 as number 018 505. It is preserved in the Neustadt/Weinstra√üe Railway Museum (Eisenbahnmuseum Neustadt/Weinstra√üe). Several locomotives were rebuilt into heating locomotives (Heizlokomotive). Number 18 602, stationed in Saarbr√ºcken was mustered out in 1983. Only the wheelsets remain and may be seen in the main railway station. Before its refurbishment, 18 612 was last used as a heating engine.  18 478  Locomotive No. 18 478 Number 18 478 (see infobox), stabled in Ulm was the last S 3/6 to be built in the state railway era (1918) and thus the last one also with a streamlined driver's cab (Windschneidenf√ºhrerhaus). It found its way to Linz, where it was substantially restored by the Swiss, Serge Lory. Today this engine is in the ownership of the Bavarian Railway Museum (Bayerisches Eisenbahnmuseum) in N√∂rdlingen. The locomotive was made operational again by the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works (Dampflokwerk Meiningen) and was given a green state railway livery again and the original operating number 3673. From 1996, it could be seen on numerous specials. Allg√§u Railway The engine, temporarily painted in blue for advertising purposes under a contract from the firm of M√§rklin, has been stabled in N√∂rdlingen since April 2004. In order to be used on future services, considerable work was necessary on the 87-year-old locomotive, which still has its original boiler. The engine had a second roll out in June 2010 and is again certified for passenger trains.

Biography Marian Elliott was born on October 25, 1921, in New Haven, Connecticut, to Margrethe Schmidt Elliott and Walter Elliott. Her mother was a teacher who had immigrated from Denmark and her father was a hardware salesman of Southern Baptist background. When she was four, her younger brother contracted typhoid fever, and she was tutored by two neighbor girls. She was something of a tomboy, befriending three Jewish boys with whom she would attend WPA theater productions. She was the only girl in her class who dared to handle a three-foot black constrictor snake, for which she won a can of rattlesnake meat. Marian attended Vassar College in New York and graduated in 1942 with a degree in bacteriology. She then attended the University of Chicago, where she received her M.S. in bacteriology in 1943. In Chicago she worked on reducing the spread of respiratory diseases and was a member of a research team that developed a vaccine for cholera. While at Chicago she met Daniel Koshland, a biochemist and heir to the Levi Strauss fortune. In 1945, she joined him in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and spent a year working on the Manhattan Project, researching the biological effects of radiation. The two married in 1946 and returned to Chicago, where Marian received her Ph.D. in immunology from the University of Chicago in 1949. Marian's sister-in-law later recalled that her professor didn't want to give her a Ph.D. because Marian was pregnant and he thought she would waste it. In 1949, she moved with Daniel to Boston, where Marian spent two years in a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School's Department of Bacteriology. They later both worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for 13 years. In the early 1950s, Koshland demonstrated the molecular differences between serum-borne and secreted antibodies. By the 1960s, she had turned her attention to the origins of antibody specificity. Jim Allison, a colleague from Berkeley, said \\"Bunny analyzed polyclonal antibodies directed against two different haptens, and on the basis of exquisitely careful amino acid composition analyses, convincingly showed that these antibodies had different amino acid compositions and therefore must differ in their amino acid sequence. These data had a profound effect on theories of antibody formation and how antibody specificity was generated. Legend has it that at the annual meeting of the American Association of Immunology where she first presented her data, her talk was received by a standing ovation‚Äîquite high praise indeed.\\" Koshland became a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965 and joined the faculty in 1970. She studied molecular biology with David Baltimore in his MIT lab in the late 1970s. From 1982 to 1989 she was chair of UC Berkeley's Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Later she led that department's Graduate Affairs Division. She also served on the board of the National Science Foundation and was a president of the Council of American Association of Immunologists in 1982‚Äì1983. She won the inaugural Excellence in Science Award from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in 1989 and was honored by the AAI Committee for the Status of Women in Science. Koshland died in Berkeley, California, on October 28, 1997, of lung cancer. The Marian Koshland Science Museum in Washington, D.C., which features exhibits geared toward the general public, and the Marian E. Koshland Integrated Natural Science Center at Haverford College, which houses the elite liberal arts college's science departments, are both named in her honor. Koshland's children, Catherine Koshland and Douglas Koshland, both attended Haverford and presently hold appointments in UC Berkeley's Engineering and Molecular and Cell biology departments, respectively.

Once on the island, Van Hoorn became impatient at delays in receiving ransom payments. He ordered a dozen Spanish prisoners executed and had their heads delivered to Veracruz as a sign of his displeasure. De Graaf was furious and the two quarrelled and then fought a duel during which Van Hoorn received a minor injury to his wrist. The wound turned gangrenous and Van Hoorn died shortly thereafter.Marley (2010, pp.100-101) Later visits Alabaster vessel found on the island (British Museum).

Hays in 1871 for the minstrel trade. Written in dialect, the song tells of an elderly man, presumably a slave or former slave, passing his later years in a broken-down old log cabin. The title is from a refrain: \\"de little old log cabin in de lane\\". The Ballad Index by Robert B. Waltz and David G. Engle lists more than 20 recordings of the song from 1903 to 1940. http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/ballads/RcLOLCIL.html The Metropolitan Quartet recorded the harmonized sentimental minstrel version in 1918, which has been digitized for online listening at the University of California at Santa Barbara.. http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020#=1&start;=1&query;=cylinder5766 Performers modified the lyric over the years, eliminating Hays' \\"darky\\" dialect along with the original reference to slavery. For example, the \\"old master and mistress\\" became the narrator's parents in mid-20th century Bluegrass versions. The song itself was popular, resulting in several answer songs, but the melody was even more widely used, including songs set in the cowboy West: Western songs such as \\"The Little Old Sod Shanty on the Claim\\" and \\"Little Joe, The Wrangler\\";Thorp, Songs of the Cowboys, pp. xviii-xviv: \\"Again, others have been built upon well-known airs; 'The Cowboy's Dream' is sung to the tune of 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean,' and Jack Thorp's 'Little Joe, the Wrangelr' was composed to the tune of 'The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane'. \\" railroad songs, \\"Little Red Caboose Behind The Train\\"; and even hymns, \\"The Lily of the Valley\\". Fiddlin' John Carson's recording of \\"The Little Old Log Cabin In The Lane\\" was one of the first commercial recordings by a rural white musician.Carlin, Country Music, p. x: \\"One artist whom Brockman recommended was a fifty-plus-year-old fiddler and sometime house painter named Fiddlin' John Carson; the Okeh label dutifully made a custom record of Carson singing the late-nineteenth-century popular song 'The little Old Log Cabin in the Lane' for Brockman to sell, but didn't even bother to assign a master number or affix a label to the 500 records pressed for him. It was only after the record became a regional hit that the light bulb of commerce lit up in the executives' heads, and suddenly they were scouring the countryside for entertainers.\\" Its popularity ensured that the industry would continue recording rural folk songs. The only known recording of banjo player Uncle John Scruggs was a newsreel film performance of this song.  Lyrics ReferencesBibliography *Carlin, Richard. Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary.

He is a Roman Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929. Life His father had entertained Edmund Campion at the ancestral home, Mount St. John, early in 1581. Young William, inspired by Campion, went abroad to train as a priest. He was first at the seminary at Reims, then went to study under the Jesuits at Tournai (1582‚Äì1584). He would have joined the order, but his health broke down and forced him to keep at home for the next six years. In February 1591, however, he was able to return once more to Reims, and, having been ordained, returned at midsummer 1592. The following May he fell into the hands of the English authorities, whereupon he was arrested and confined to the dungeons for several months. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn for the crime of being a Catholic priest. William Harrington was given the chance to spare his life if he renounced the Catholic faith and were to attend Protestant services just once. William refused. He was tortured on the rack, hanged until not quite dead, then disemboweled, before being beheaded. William's fate had an important literary side-effect. One of those who had sheltered him was Henry Donne, the brother of the poet John Donne. Henry was arrested, and died of the plague in Newgate Prison. John Donne was a Catholic too, but later embraced the Protestant Church of England, in an effort to spare his own life. William Harrington was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI. His Feast Day is 18 February. He is also venerated on 22 November as one of the Martyrs of England, Scotland and Wales and on 29 October as one of the Martyrs of Douai.

The western side of Skodsborg borders the J√¶gersborg Dyrehave with miles of trails for hiking and cycling. The town is connected with the Oresundtrain and with buses to neighboring communities.  History  Ole J√∏rgen Rawert: Retraite and Strandm√∏llen, 1825 Skodsborg was a late developed community on the Oresund coast being hemmed in by the king's hunting forest of Dyrehaven. For many years it was just a stretch of coastal road with a few summer residences of rich Copenhagen dignitaries and the M√∏lle√• industry. The river to the north of Skodsborg, M√∏lle√•en was the site of the earliest Danish industrial production. The first Danish paper mill was located here in 1599, as one of seven water mills driven factories on the river. In 1785 two enterprising English industrialists Nelthropp and Harris who established the country's largest leather goods manufacturing plant. They were bankrupted in 1803 during the Napoleonic wars, where England was the enemy, and they were condemned as spies. Skodsborg continued its unique dual evolution as summer residence for the very rich with two hotels and a spa catering to the same clientele - along with its role as an active industrial town producing paper, cloth and hats. The most prominent dweller in Skodsborg was undoubtedly King Frederick VII. In 1852, he bought the Skodsborg summer residence built by Volrad von der L√ºhe a century earlier and spent the summers there until his death in 1863. He wanted a place away from the court gossip at Amalienborg aimed at his down to earth commoner wife, Louise Rasmussen, enabled with the title of countess Danner. The king who three years earlier has signed the Danish constitution cementing parliamentary rule, wanted peace and quiet to ride, hunt and fish. He was an amateur archaeologist and outdoors man who enjoyed excavating the Bronze Age burial mounds in the surrounding woodland and sleeping in his tent. However, his presence also required the grand railway station still in use today, in order to meet and greet foreign dignitaries. In 1910 the Danish social democrat leader and later Prime Minister, Thorvald Stauning invited the Second Socialt International meeting in Copenhagen to visit Skodsborg. The visitors included Vladimir Lenin, Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxembourg and Alexandra Kollontay. In Skodsborg they met a thriving working community with their own school and cooperative. In 1913 Skodsborg saw the creation of Dansk Hattefabrik A/S (the Danish Hat Manufacturer Ltd), established by the visionary industrialist Hans Cohen came from Berlin . At its zenith in 1950 the plant was producing 500.000 hats a year. H. G. F.

The Billies played their games at Williamsport High School athletic fields, now on the campus of the Pennsylvania College of Technology They team later played all their home games in Bowman Field which is currently the home of the Williamsport Crosscutters of the New York‚ÄìPenn League. The Billies' name was changed to the Williamsport Grays for the 1924 season, a name that stuck with many of the organizations in Williamsport throughout much of the 20th century. In 1953, the club was referred to as the Williamsport A's or Williamsport Athletics a Class AA affiliate of the Philadelphia Athletics. The Athletics names lasted for just the 1953 season. The franchise was purchased at the end of the 1952 season by five anonymous businessmen from the Detroit Tigers. The ownership group moved to establish a working arrangement with the Philadelphia A's owned by Connie Mack. From 1947‚Äì1949 and again in 1951‚Äì1952, The team was named the Williamsport Tigers were a AA affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. Detroit had a working relationship with Williamsport from 1946 until 1952. Ownership The Tigers were owned by Earle Halstead a former American Association umpire and businessman from Dearborn, Michigan. Halstead gave up his business ventures in favor of owning a minor league baseball team. Halstead arranged for the Williamsport franchise to have a working agreement with the Detroit Tigers of the American League. But later went on the scout for the Milwaukee Braves, signing Bob Buhl and Red Murff (who later himself became a scout and signed Nolan Ryan). In 1960, he bought the Baseball Blue Book, Inc., which published the \\"Baseball Blue Book\\", frequently referred to as the bible of baseball. He later patented a curveball pitching machine and formed the company named Tru-Pitch, Inc., which revolutionized batting practice on all levels of baseball. The Tigers were the 1945 World Series champions. Local fans were hopeful that the Tigers would fill the roster of the Williamsport team with better players that had previously been sent to Williamsport by the Washington Senators and Philadelphia A's. The Tigers were two step below the Tigers. Detroit's top farm club was in Buffalo, New York and the two teams below the Williamsport club were in Rome, and Jamestown, New York. Players moved from franchise to franchise as their stock in the Detroit Tigers system rose and fell. The Tigers took control of the franchise in 1947 and improved Bowman Field by spending $40,000 to repair flood damage and installing grandstand seats from Briggs Stadium in Detroit. The franchise was sold at the end of the 1952 season to five anonymous businessmen for $7,500. The Tigers era ended at the same time when the team was once again aligned with the Philadelphia A's and the Williamsport Grays name was restored. Seasons The Billies were league champions in 1923 with a record of 82-42. The most prominent player was Mule Haas who would go on to play for the Philadelphia Athletics from 1929‚Äì1931. The Williamsport A's struggled on the field. They finished in sixth place with a record of 65 wins and 85 losses. The first African-Americans to play professional baseball in Williamsport were members of the squad. Joe Taylor a veteran of the Negro Leagues and H√©ctor L√≥pez who would go on to play in the majors with the A's and New York Yankees played the full season for the Williamsport A's. The Williamsport Grays changed their name to the Tigers for the 1947 season. This was their second year of affiliation with Detroit Tigers, and it was the first time that the Eastern League team in Williamsport was known as something other than the Grays. The 1947 club was managed by George Detore. The Tigers finished in 5th place of an eight team league with a record of 67 wins and 74 losses. The 1948 season saw the Tigers have a change in manager with Gene Desautels taking over. The Tigers finished in fourth place in the Eastern League and reached a one-game playoff for the final spot in the league playoffs. The Tigers lost that game to the Hartford Chiefs. Lou Kretlow who would go on to play in the majors for the Tigers, St. Louis Browns, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox and the A's was named the league's Most Valuable Player. The Tigers slipped back into mediocrity during the 1949, 1951 and 1952 seasons. The 1950 Grays fared no better. Notable players and managers to pass through Williamsport during these years included, Jack Tighe, Schoolboy Rowe and Hall of Famer Jim Bunning.

It was placed on the List of Registered Historic Places in New Jersey on November 4, 2004. The house is part of the Rutherford campus of Felician College and underwent a renovation that was completed in 2013. History The home was built in 1869 by Floyd W. Tomkins who called it \\"Hill House\\". It was purchased in 1887 by David Brinkerhoff Ivison who greatly expanded it and gave the home the name \\"Iviswold\\". The expansion was designed by the architect William Henry Miller. Ivison died in 1903 and Iviswold was sold and resold multiple times. During this period the building was used by the Rutherford Union Club. In 1930 the building was owned by the Rutherford National Bank, then headed by Fairleigh S. Dickinson. In 1942 Fairleigh Dickinson University was created and held the first classes within Iviswold. As the university grew it built multiple college buildings around Iviswold, but by the late 1980s the college was outgrowing their Rutherford campus, which was closed in 1994 and sold along with Iviswold to Felician University in 1997. Felician University spent several years restoring the building to its original condition.http://www.felician.edu/newsarticles/?article_id=439 The New Jersey Historic Trust contributed $1,550,000 to the restoration project. Construction The original home was a two-story stone house with a mansard roof. The 1887 remodeling of the house was inspired by the Ch√¢teau de Chaumont in Loir-et-Cher, France. The remodeling turned the building into a three-story turreted mansion with 25 rooms, including balconies, a music room and a porte- coch√®re. Local brownstone was used in the construction of the exterior walls. In the 1930s, an indoor pool was installed with a water tower built into the structure to supply it. In the 1970s, when Fairleigh Dickinson was using the building for classroom space, the college covered up much of the original interior with drop ceilings and partition walls.

He was born in San Gimignano and was active there and in Florence. According to Giorgio Vasari, Mainardi is portrayed in the frescoes in the Sassetti and Tornabuoni Chapels by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Mainardi's brother-in-law and master.Bastiano Mainardi Bio Vasari also claimed that Mainardi took part in Ghirlandaio's frescoes (1476) in the Abbey of Passignano in Val di Pesa, near Florence, and in the chapel of Saint Fina in the Collegiata of San Gimginano (1485). The Annunciation fresco in the loggia of San Gimignano's Collegiata, dated 1482, is often also attributed to Mainardi. Mainardi's authorship of these works was, however, proven impossible when Italian art historian Lisa Venturini discovered Mainardi's birthdate as 1466 (it was previously placed around 1460 or earlier). Thus, Mainardi was too young to have assisted Ghirlandaio in these works or to have painted the Annunciation San Gimignano (which is now regarded as a work by Domenico Ghirlandaio's brother, Davide). Further, Mainardi could probably not have painted most of the Ghirlandaio workshop paintings once attributed to him, like the famous tondo of the Madonna and Child with the Infant Saint John the Baptist and Three Angels at the Louvre. Mainardi's secure works are nevertheless strongly indebted to Ghirlandaio's, and the artist had a lifelong affiliation with the Ghirlandaio family workshop. One of his latest works, an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints, commissioned in 1511 for the church of Sant'Agostino in San Gimignano (where it remains today), was completed after his death in 1513 by Domenico Ghirlandaio's son, Ridolfo.  Paintings by Bastiano Mainardi  Art historians recognize the following paintings as certainly by Mainardi and among his most important works: * Saint Gimignano Blessing Three Men above a Memorial to Domenico Strambi, dated 1488, fresco (San Gimignano, Sant'Agostino). * Saint Jerome; Madonna and Child, both dated 1490, frescoes (Florence, Museo Nazionale del Bargello). * Madonna della Cintola, circa 1492-95, fresco (Florence, Santa Croce, Baroncelli chapel). * Frescoes, including Saints Gimignano, Lucy, Augustine and the Four Evangelist in the vault of the chapel of San Bartolo in the church Sant'Agostino, San Gimignano, formerly signed and dated 1500. * Piet√† with the Decapitated Saint John the Baptist and Saint Paul, dated 1500, panel, originally in the Altoviti family chapel in the Palazzo dei Vicari, Certaldo (Schwerin, Staatlisches Museum). * Frescoes with the Madonna and Child and Saints, circa 1500-10 (San Gimignano, Ospedale di Santa Fina). * Madonna and Child with Two Angels, circa 1502, tondo (San Gimignano, Museo Civico). * Madonna and Child with Saints Jerome and Bernardo Tolomei, dated 1502, panel (San Gimignano, Museo Civico; originally in the Mainardi family chapel in the church of Monteoliveto, outside San Gimignano). * Madonna and Child with an Angel, circa 1502, tondo (San Gimignano, Museo Civico). * Madonna and Child in Glory with Saints Augustine, Gimignano, Mary Magdalen, John the Baptist and Catherine (painted in collaboration with Biagio d'Antonio), circa 1502, panel (San Gimignano, Museo Civico). * Madonna of the Seven Sorrows with Saints Gregory and Peter Martyr, circa 1505, panel (Campi Bisenzio, Florence, Santi Lorenzo e Martino). * Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian, Francis, Tobias and the Angel and Bernardino of Siena, circa 1505, fresco (Incisa Val d'Arno, San Lorenzo a Cappiano). * Nativity with Saints Jerome and Francis, circa 1505, panel (Pelago, Florence, Museo d'Arte Sacra). * Madonna and Child with Saints Julian and Francis, dated 1506, panel (Palermo, Chiaramonte Bordonaro Collection). * Madonna and Child with Saints Dominic, Lawrence, John the Baptist and Lucy, 1507, panel (Incisa Val d'Arno, Museo d'Arte Sacra). * Madonna and Child with Saints Justus and Margaret, dated 1507, panel (Indianapolis Museum of Art). * Madonna and Child with Saints Benedict, Michael, Cassiano, Ambrose and Dominic, dated 1511, panel (Palazzuolo sul Senio, Santo Stefano).

He served in the White House for 42 years and as Usher for 29 years, and both records remain unbroken as of 2019. Career Irwin \\"Ike\\" Hoover was born in Washington, D.C., the son of a grocer. His first job was as a telephone operator, but he later became an electrician. He became an employee of the Edison Electric Company, and was sent to the White House on May 6, 1891, to install the first electric lights and an electric bell system in the executive mansion. At the time, no private building in the city had electricity, and the only government-owned building which did was the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. President Benjamin Harrison and his family considered electricity dangerous, and no one in the Harrison family would even turn a light switch for fear of electrocution. On May 15, when Hoover finished the installation, he was asked by President Harrison to leave Edison Electric and join the White House staff as an electrician. Hoover agreed. For the next several years, Hoover's job was to turn lights on and off throughout the day, and to assist the family in using the bell system (which they were also afraid of). As the Harrisons and other presidential families became less fearful of electricity, Hoover's job was to keep the system working and to install new electrical wiring and appliances as needed. In 1904, Hoover accepted a position as an usher at the White House. The White House had asked him to act as temporary usher on several previous occasions, so the promotion was not as unusual as it might seem. Hoover was appointed Chief Usher by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909. (Hoover and Roosevelt were already well-acquainted with one another, as Roosevelt had served on the United States Civil Service Commission during the Harrison administration and had been Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President William McKinley.) Hoover served as Chief Usher until his death in 1933. From 1891 until 1909, his daily uniform was a tailcoat (which hung to below the knees), waistcoat, formal trousers, and dress shirt with tie. This changed when President William Howard Taft allowed staff to wear business suits. During these 42 years of service, Hoover had intimate daily contact with ten Presidents and their families. As Chief Usher, he was the executive head of the household, in charge of all social affairs and entrusted with confidential matters of every description regarding the household and First Family. It was also his duty to welcome guests of the President, to arrange the details of their visits, and to make them feel at home in the White House. During his tenure at the White House, Hoover oversaw the preparations for the funerals of President McKinley and President Warren G. Harding. He also oversaw the planning for the weddings of Alice Roosevelt, Eleanor Wilson, and Jessie Wilson, presidential daughters who were all married at the White House. When President Woodrow Wilson traveled to France for peace negotiations at the end of World War I, Hoover traveled with him and controlled the staff and household operations in the palaces where Wilson stayed. Death Grave of Ike Hoover at Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Ike Hoover died suddenly at his home in Washington, D.C., of a heart attack on the evening of September 14, 1933. His death was reported on the front page of the next day's The Washington Post. President Franklin D. Roosevelt offered the use of the White House for Hoover's funeral, but the Hoover family declined the offer. Hoover's funeral was held at the Glenwood Cemetery Mortuary Chapel at Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Colonel Julien E. Yates, chief of all United States Army chaplains, officiated. President Roosevelt, members of his Cabinet, and Roosevelt's personal secretary Louis Howe served as honorary pallbearers. The entire White House staff attended the funeral. Hoover was buried at Glenwood Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Hattie Mary Hoover, and his son and daughter.

Founded in 1820, it is currently in its second building, a stone Gothic Revival style structure dating to 1869. Members of the church have done much of the work on both buildings, and the church itself is actively involved in the community. The main church building is the only known extant work of architect Julius Munckowitz. Two outbuildings, a manse and a house built by a former parishioner, were built around the same time and of similar materials but show traces of the Second Empire style, such as mansard roofs. They have changed very little since they were first opened, despite the conversion of one into a day care center. All three were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as a well-preserved example of an urban Gothic Revival church. Buildings The property has three buildings: the church, a manse and the Second Empire-style house of Robert Wilde, an early congregant and owner of the property. All three are considered contributing resources to the National Register listing. The church and Wilde's house are connected by a more modern wing which is not. =Church= The church is rectangular with a gabled nave, smaller narthex and an engaged bell tower. Its central section, faced with granite trimmed with limestone, is three bays wide by five deep. In addition to the non-contributing connecting wing, it has another one, polygonal in shape, that is original to the building although greatly modified since then. South Presbyterian's exterior has lancet windows with wood tracery, limestone hoods and diamond-shaped bosses. The main entrance features Gothic-carved wood doors beneath a carved tympanum. The bell tower features a lancet window of its own, with four smaller tabernacle windows on its octagonal spire separated from the lower level by a wooden frieze. Inside, the church's sanctuary features a ribbed plaster ceiling and its original pews and wainscoting. Pew number 49 is marked with a brass plaque noting its use by Theodore Roosevelt while he was vacationing in Dobbs Ferry in summer 1871. The second floor of the original wing has heavy molded plaster cornices. =Wilde House= The Wilde House dates to 1870. It is a six-by-three-bay two-story granite structure with brick window trim and a convex mansard roof. The second-story windows are also paired, separated by wood colonettes with stylized capitals. Polygonal bays flank the entrance and a stone course separates the two main stories. A wood front porch has chamfered posts and carved balusters. Its interior has been modified for its present use as a day care center, but still retains original woodwork such as the banister on the stairway. The hearth of one of the fireplaces still has its original tiling. =Manse= The manse, probably built in 1869, is likewise a granite building with a mansard roof, in its case a bracketed one topped by red slate. It is two stories high and three bays square. The roof dormers have bargeboards with Gothic Revival detailing, as does the wooden porch in the rear. There is a one-story two-bay extension on the north side with a flat bracketed roof. Some of its fenestration also uses Gothic Revival detailing. A front bay window is surrounded with decorative wood carving, and in the rear there is a lancet window in the middle of the second story. History As a congregation, South Presbyterian Church dates to 1820. At that time Dobbs Ferry was merely a small cluster of buildings around a junction on the Albany Post Road, and there were no churches. On Sundays devout locals met in the largest building then in town, the barn on Peter Van Brugh Livingston's estate, to attend services conducted by travelling Presbyterian or Methodist ministers. Three years later, the group formally incorporated as South Presbyterian Church, to distinguish themselves from a North Presbyterian Church in the nearby hamlet of Halls Corners. In August 1823, six congregants bought a triangle of land at the present junction of Storm Street and Ashford Road. The small church built on the property was made of local timber and painted white in the style of New England rural churches. It was known as the Little White Church for years afterwards. Today it is gone and a Lutheran church stands on the site, but the original cemetery, known as the Little White Cemetery, remains. Two years later, in 1825, the church was officially received by the Presbytery of New York. That body censured the church six years later when discord broke out after Van Brugh Livingston, its original benefactor, tried to require that anyone joining the church sign a temperance pledge agreeing to abstain from distilled beverages. He resigned as an elder afterwards. The church continued to grow over the next few decades, and by the 1860s it had 140 members. All agreed it was time for a new church building. James Wilde, one of the wealthier members, located and bought for the church the current property, closer to the center of the growing village, in 1864. Julius Munckowitz, an architect about whom little is known outside South Presbyterian Church save his early membership in the American Society of Architects (a predecessor to today's American Institute of Architects) and his later tenure as supervising architect of the New York City Department of Public Parks, designed the church, and the cornerstone was laid in 1868. As with the original church, construction was done by congregants (or their businesses) using local materials. The granite was supposedly quarried and cut near the old church. Local firms also did the carpentry and masonry. Individual members donated their labor, money or both. When the new church was dedicated on the last Sunday in 1869, it had every modern convenience of the day, including gas lighting. The manse, begun that year Wilde had originally built the stone house as a retirement home, but never used it for that purpose. He instead conveyed it to the Misses Masters, founders of the nearby Masters School. In 1916 the school turned it over to the church, which began using it as a parish hall. The church has been improved twice with the addition of stained glass in the sanctuary lancet windows. In 1914, it was J. Gordon Guthrie, a congregant, who also did the rose window in the rear. He used as his models for the women depicted three fellow congregants. Fifty years later, in 1964, it was J.M. Baransky of nearby Yonkers who did the non-figurative pastel stained glass in the central section. The original pipe organ was replaced in 1928, on a new balcony, by the current model, formerly in use at Manhattan's Central Presbyterian Church. The bell dates to 1876, when it was cast by the Troy foundry of Meneely & Kimberly. The connecting wing between the church and Wilde House was erected in 1954, but attempts were made to keep it architecturally sympathetic to the older buildings.  Today  South Presbyterian continues an activist tradition that dates to Livingston's stand against liquor. During Reconstruction, it raised money to help freedmen in the South. The church congregation works to help the homeless and poor in New York City and Yonkers. It supports gay rights, raises money for AIDS-related causes and holds an annual Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast. Some of its space is rented out to programs that benefit the community. One room of the church is rented to an art school for children, and the first floor of the Wilde House is home to the Days of Wonder day care center. The original connection between Wilde and the Masters School continues in one of its afterschool clubs and activities, where students volunteer at Days of Wonder.

She currently sings under the pseudonym Tiger Fake Fur.  Biography  Early life = Kawamoto grew up hearing her mother playing the piano. Aside from learning piano, she also studied ballet for about two years and joined the boys' and girls' chorus and took flute lessons. Her life was changed upon seeing a rock festival held in the nearby Prefectural Hall in her high school days. Kawamoto entered the Jin-ai Women's College music department, piano department and formed a band. After graduating from college, Kawamoto found a job at a company and became a piano teacher. However, since she only received a salary of 40,000 yen, she got fed up with her job and quit. Still, she continued to teach piano in her parents' house. She earned her livelihood working at a wedding hall, during which time she continued to try forming a band. Kawamoto participated in \\"AIDS against FUKUI\\" held in Fukui as a band. She wrote the song and made all the members in the hall sing on the pretext of being elected to the executive committee. Because of that, she was invited to Sony‚Äôs \\"Showcase\\" where amateurs perform live in audition style. Since she was pleased with Tokyo, she saved 1 million yen within half a year, and went to Tokyo at the age of 21. She had a feeling that they liked her performance, but her position was still ambiguous for a while. She worked hard at composition while working part-time in a strange city. Although poor, she lived happily. = Major label days = Because Kawamoto often went to the head office of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, she got to know the staff of the management office, and she signed a contract with them at the age of 22. It was decided that Kawamoto would release a CD from the second production department of Sony. She practised acoustic guitar hard to reproduce the sound of the demo tape of her debut single \\"Ai no Sain≈ç\\" which Yasuyuki Okamura produced. She was given the stage name of \\"Makoto Kawamoto\\" and made her debut as a singer. She lost weight as the result of pressure from appearing on TV programs or radio programs, and from pressure of composing music. Kawamoto released her 2nd single \\"DNA\\", for which she wrote words and music herself, and her 3rd single \\"1/2\\" which were tied to popular anime Rurouni Kenshin, and her first album Kawamoto Makoto. However, she encountered problems when she found it difficult to write songs after that, and she occasionally confined herself in a hotel. She did not agree with the record label's plan for her activities, due to pressure, she got out of shape and went home temporarily. Although she thought she might retire as a musician, she was retained by Sony for two more years, and she returned to Tokyo. However, she came to devote herself to live performances without releasing a new song after she released the single \\"Blossom\\" in 2001. She came to find pleasure in her work and began to think that she might continue it for a while. However, after talking it over, she decided not to renew the contract with Sony. In October 2002, she left. In April 2003, her contract with Antinos Records expired and she became a freelancer. = Independent music = In 2005, Kawamoto sang the commercial song of Kanebo \\"ALLIE\\", which was Maria Anzai's cover song \\".\\" However, it is not released at present. In 2005, Kawamoto formed \\"MihoMihoMakoto\\" with Miho Asahi and Miho Moribayashi, and they performed in the concerts. On January 25, 2006, Kawamoto announced that she finished music activity with \\"Makoto Kawamoto\\" name in her homepage. On April 24, 2006, Kawamoto announced that she changed her name to \\"Tiger Fake Fur\\" with her blog. When she appeared on the live by request of her acquaintance before, it was difficult for her to use the name of \\"Makoto Kawamoto.\\" Under such a circumstance, she could not but use the alias. She introduced herself as \\"Tiger Carpet\\" at first, but she said that she felt sorry for a dead tiger, and renamed it to \\"Tiger Fake Fur.\\" On July 5, 2006, Kawamoto released a CD as time-limited group of 3 chorus unit \\"MihoMihoMakoto\\" after an interval of five years, and she resumed musical activities completely. On August 9, 2006, Kawamoto released new 1st single \\"Yagi-≈ç no Theme\\" in the \\"Tiger Fake Fur\\" name from HMJM(hamajim) Records. Recently Kawamoto gives a concert in Tokyo and her hometown, Fukui wherever her feet led her, and she enjoys it. In 2009, Kawamoto sang \\"Hontou no Hanashi\\" in documentary film \\"An'nyon Yumika\\". It is announced that Kawamoto will release her 3rd solo album \\"\\" which she produces for herself on February 19, 2010.  Topics  In the 1990s, she often went to various Southeast Asian countries, especially to Philippines, and made her music videos there. According to her, she traveled to Southeast Asia especially Philippines many times during the 1990s, to absorb \\"fashionable atmospheres\\". For this reason, her music videos often contain those landscapes and people.  Discography  Singles =  Ai no Sain≈ç  is Makoto Kawamoto's 1st single released on May 2, 1996.

He played hurling with his local club Tullaroan and was a member of the Kilkenny senior inter-county team from 1909 until 1926. Grace is one of only a handful of players to have won All-Ireland medals in each of three decades. Biography Dick Grace was born in Tullaroan, County Kilkenny in 1891. He was educated at the local national school and, in time, would go on to become one of his county‚Äôs greatest-ever hurlers. The Graces of Tullaroan were synonymous with both hurling and Gaelic football. Between them the three brothers ‚Äì Dick, Jack and Pierce - won a total of 15 All-Ireland senior medals ‚Äì eight in hurling and seven in football. Playing careerClub= Grace played his club hurling with his local Tullaroan club and enjoyed much success, winning his first county title in 1910. He added more county titles to his collection in 1911, 1915, 1924 and 1925. At the end of the 20th century Grace was chosen on the Tullaroan Hurling Team of the Century. =Inter- county= Grace first came to prominence on the inter-county scene for Kilkenny in 1909. That year he came on as a substitute in the All-Ireland final against Tipperary in Cork. The game was a high-scoring one as Tipperary suffered their first defeat in nine All-Ireland final appearances. A 4-6 to 0-12 victory gave Grace his first All-Ireland medal. Kilkenny surrendered their Leinster and All-Ireland crowns in 1910, however, 1911 saw Grace picking up his first Leinster winners‚Äô medal. There was controversy in the All-Ireland final as Kilkenny were destined to play Limerick. On the first occasion the pitch in Cork was water-logged and the game was refixed for Thurles. Limerick pulled out of the replay and the title was awarded to Kilkenny. Limerick defeated Kilkenny in a challenge match later that same year; however, Grace was the one who had collected a second All-Ireland medal. The following year Grace collected a second Leinster medal before lining out in another All- Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion in a low-scoring but close game. A 2-1 to 1-3 victory gave Grace a third All-Ireland medal. In 1913 Kilkenny were attempting to make history by capturing their third championship in-a-row. Kilkenny retained their provincial dominance with Walsh collecting a third Leinster title. The All-Ireland final saw ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô square up to Tipperary in the first fifteen-a-side final. Kilkenny had the lead at half-time and only scored a goal in the second-half. They won the game by 2-4 to 1-2 giving Grace a fourth All-Ireland winners‚Äô medal. Four All-Ireland titles in-a-row proved beyond this Kilkenny team as they were beaten by Laois in 1914. Two years later in 1916 Grace added a fourth Leinster title to his collection as his team defeated Wexford in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on their near rivals Tipperary. In an exciting game which saw Grace and Tommy Shanahan of Tipp being sent off, Kilkenny went five points ahead, however, Tipp bounced back to win the game by 5-4 to 3-2. Kilkenny went into decline following this defeat. The team lost Leinster finals to Dublin in 1917, 1919, 1920 and 1921. The team bounced back in 1922 and Grace won his fifth Leinster title following an eight-point victory over Dublin. This victory allowed ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô to advance to the All- Ireland final where Tipperary were the opponents. With three minutes left in the game Tipp were leading by three points, however, last-minute goals by Paddy Donoghue and Dick Tobin secured a 4-2 to 2-6 victory for Kilkenny. Grace had captured his fifth All-Ireland medal in his third decade as a player. It would be 45 years before Kilkenny would beat Tipp in the championship again. Grace added a sixth Leinster title to his collection in 1923 following another trouncing of Dublin, however, Galway accounted for Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final. Two years late rin 1925 Grace captured a seventh Leinster medal, however, Galway won the day in the All-Ireland semi-final once again. The following year Grace captained Kilkenny to yet another Leinster title, his eighth overall. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny line out against Cork at a snow-covered Croke Park. Cork took the lead at half-time and went on to win the game by 4-6 to 2-0. Following this defeat Grace decided to retire from inter-county hurling.

It is an umbrella term, incorporating various health care delivery systems that involve direct financial relationships between patients and health care providers. Background Direct primary care has been promoted by certain groups of physicians as a means for patients to save money on their primary care services, as well as other ancillary-performed services such as laboratory testing, etc. Often, there are no insurance co-pays, deductibles or co- insurance fees thus avoiding the overhead and complexity of maintaining relationships with insurers. Under this model, patients may pay a combination of visit fees and/or fixed monthly fees which grant them access to a set of medical services, including same and next-day appointments, which may take the form of office visits and/or house calls. Typically a direct primary care arrangement is paired with either: * A high-deductible health plan, as DPC alone will not cover catastrophic health care such as most surgeries * A health savings account, or health reimbursement account as the associated tax- benefits can generally be applied to DPC and other medical expenses. One of the lesser known provisions of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States can be found in Section 1301 (and amendment Section 10104). This provision allows for direct primary care to compete with traditional health insurance options in the mandated Health insurance exchange when combined with a low cost high deductible plan.  Advantages  Direct primary care practices do not typically accept insurance payments, thus avoiding the overhead and complexity of maintaining relationships with insurers, which can take as much as $0.10 - $0.20 of each medical dollar spent. Consequently, because direct pay members are usually automatically billed a physicians practice's cash flow can also be improved. An emerging model of direct primary care involves the medical practice contracting with self-insured (or self-funded) employers who offer the direct primary care option as a means of accessing care for free or drastically reduced office visit fees. This is also known as onsite health. The employer pays the membership fees on behalf of the employee to the DPC practice directly. This option usually provides the employee same or next business day access to care. This allows workers to address evolving health concerns rapidly in order that the condition can be treated more quickly and the number of sick days or days of decreased productivity from illness might be reduced. Many DPC practices provide phone or email access to providers so that employees or patients may not even need to leave their workplace to seek medical advice. Because direct primary care payments are typically paid over time, rather than in return for specific services, the economic incentives are such that the long-term health of the patient is the most lucrative situation for the doctor. As such, preventative care gains greater emphasis under DPC. Criticisms Opponents of direct primary care models assert that direct primary care is unethical, primarily benefitting providers and not patients. The US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires that DPC practices offering such services must include in their plans a secondary qualifying health plan (QHP) that covers other hospital services that the DPC provider may not offer if they choose to offer their DPC arrangement in the healthcare marketplace. Therefore, in cases where the DPC provider has chosen to participate in the healthcare marketplace, the patient would be required to carry and pay for an additional insurance coverage plan for catastrophic and hospital services in addition to the DPC arrangement for primary health care access if he/she purchases this plan from the healthcare marketplace. It is argued that DPC plans can be more expensive in the long term, since by design none of the payments made to the DPC provider practice are counted towards insurance deductibles because the provider neither accepts insurance nor participates in the submission and management of the insurance claims process, potentially resulting in a higher out-of-pocket catastrophic or hospital services cost to the patient because deductibles would not necessarily have been reached when these services are provided.

The station is licensed to Rodgers Broadcasting Corporation and features programming from ABC Radio, ESPN Radio, Network Indianahttp://www.networkindiana.com/ and Westwood One. Since 1927, predating the FCC, WKBV's been the area's premier signal for info and entertainment. Local programs include, Indiana State Fair Band Day, the Salvation Army Christmas, and High School Sports. History In 1926, a man from Brookville, IN was granted a permit to build a radio station in Brookville. His name was William Knox. He created the 100 watt station known as WKBV-AM 1490, standing for WilliamKnoxBrookVille (WKBV). The station was merely a hobby for Knox. Airtime in those days sold for $15.00. In 1929, the station moved to the Betsy Ross Building in Connersville, IN; its first regular programming began with six hours a day. In 1933, the station was moved to the Westcott Hotel in Richmond, IN. It was after this that WKBV became the home for Richmond Red Devil sports. RHS teacher Jim Farmer was the first Sports Director for the station, a position that would be sought after on this station. In 1943, a group of local businessmen formed the Central Broadcasting Corporation and moved the station the Leland Hotel Annex in Richmond. This is where RHS grad turned Radio-TV Star Polly Bergen did her first 15-minute show auditioning for WKBV. IN 1953, WKBV would move one last time to West Main Street in Richmond. They moved into a building built just for them. The building was state of the art. In 1960, WKBV-FM as 101.3 FM went on the air. Later on, WKBV-FM would become WRIA-FM, and then later became WFMG which is now WKBV's sister station G1013. The two have become Richmond's famous radio duo. With many cross promotions and station events. Today's programming on WKBV, is mainly ESPN radio, with sports talk and more. Local news updates are provided throughout the day, and weather is supplied by Dayton's WDTN-TV Channel 2. WKBV is the home of the Cincinnati Reds and Notre Dame as well as Miami University hockey. The current key staff members include Sports/News Director Joel Brantingham, Program Director Rick Duncan and Production Director John Rose. The station is now owned by Rodgers Broadcasting Corporation dba Whitewater Broadcasting. In the summer of 2014, WKBV would make a huge change, as they would add an FM signal. In late July 2014, W265DN 100.9 FM went on the air. With this change, WKBV moved its Red Devil programming to expand the whole county. Bringing listeners the Wayne County Game of the Week.

There are many variations with various spotting features, the common features being the ALCO RS-3 frame, trucks, and usually cab and short hood. Railroads started rebuilding their RS-3 fleets early on because of the unreliability of the ALCO 244 prime movers. The standard practice among railroads which rebuilt diesel locomotives in a manner which differed from its original configuration was to add to its original model designation an \\"m\\" for modified, an \\"r\\" for rebuilt, or a \\"u\\" for upgraded, although some railroads created a new designation, as when the Green Bay & Western reclassified its upgraded RS-3's as RS-20's. Perhaps one of the earliest examples of the RS3m is the former Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad's RS3m fleet. Built in the early 1950s by ALCO, the Katy had them rebuilt in the late 1950s by ALCO competitor, EMD, who rebuilt them with GP9 long hoods to make room for the larger EMD 567 prime movers. The Chicago and North Western Railway had a pair of RS-3ms that were rebuilt using ALCO components. These featured long hoods from ALCO RS-11 road switchers. Penn Central started rebuilding RS-3s in 1972, using parts from retired EMD passenger engines. The RS3m rebuild program started in 1972 and continued until 1978 under Conrail. The bankrupt Penn Central needed more reliable local and secondary service locomotives and had a surplus of passenger locomotives. The result is a locomotive that has the frame, body and trucks from an ALCO RS3, but using fan assemblies and EMD 567 prime movers from retired passenger engines, such as the EMD E8, in place of the original ALCO 244 prime movers. The principal visible difference on the Penn Central/Conrail rebuilds is the addition of two conical-shaped EMD switcher style exhaust stacks in place of the one rectangular-shaped ALCO stack and a raised hood. Later rebuilds would just have a raised feature on the long hood to accommodate the larger prime mover. The shape would vary from a rectangular shape with fillets on the long sides to a simple box on top of the long hood. These locomotives are often called DeWitt Geeps, so named because Penn Central started rebuilding them in their DeWitt, shops in Syracuse, New York. In 1975 The Green Bay and Western Railroad started rebuilding their four RS-3 units. They lowered the nose and raised the long hood for their new Alco engines. These rebuilds are called RS-20s. RS3u The Delaware and Hudson Railway had eight RS3u locomotives. These locomotives were rebuilt by Morrison-Knudsen of Boise, ID (also known as M-K TE56s) between December 1975 and March 1976. They received ALCO 12-251C prime movers, boosting horsepower from . To facilitate the larger prime mover, M-K raised the long hood and moved the dynamic brake cooling to a box behind the cab. The units also received a cut-down short hood for greater visibility. The D&H; was not overly fond of the conversions, referring to them as \\"Club Foots\\", because of their tendency to slip under heavy loads. It was thought that the 2000 hp prime mover was too powerful for the lightweight car body. Today, D&H; #506 survives at the Western New York & Pennsylvania Railroad as number 406. GP12 and GP16 The Missouri Pacific Railroad had a fleet of RS-3s that were rebuilt, receiving the GP12 or GP16 designation after rebuilding. These look like normal ALCo RS-3s with the addition of more exhaust stacks. The GP16 designation should not be confused with the EMD GP16s rebuilt from actual EMD locomotives. RS3ms today As of 2012, rebuilt RS-3s can be found in museums, on shortlines and as industrial switchers. The Rochester & Genesee Valley Railroad Museum has an operating RS3M painted as Lehigh Valley 211. Another example can be found on the Midland Railway MKT #142 in Baldwin City, Kansas. The Cape May Seashore Lines also owns a former Conrail RS3M which is still painted in its faded former Conrail livery. Pioneer Railcorp has an RS3m stored on their property which was formerly used on the Michigan Southern Railroad The Maryland and Delaware Railroad owns three former Conrail units, numbered 1201, 1202, and 1203. The Housatonic Railroad Co. (HRRC), based in Canaan, Connecticut purchased an RS-3m, number 9935, from Conrail in 1986. As of 2018 this locomotive remains in service with the Housatonic as a fill in when needed and had been on loan with the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum (BSRM) as an operating unit from at least 2005 thru 2014 when that museum moved operations to Adams, MA.

Respectively, both are the fourth and fifth episode of their season, and they premiered in the United States on Fox on November 4 and 11, 2007\\\\. In the former, housewife Lois receives cruise tickets from anthropomorphic dog Brian, and invites her husband, Peter, on the cruise with her. This upsets Stewie, and he ultimately appears to murder Lois while she is on the cruise, only to find out that she had survived the attack as the year passes. In the latter, Lois is able to expose Stewie as the villain that he is, but he soon accomplishes his dream of world domination. \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" was written by David A. Goodman and directed by John Holmquist, while \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Greg Colton. Both episodes received relatively positive reviews for their combined story arc and cultural references. \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" featured appearances by Patrick Stewart, Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson, Simon Cowell and Willem Dafoe (although Dafoe did not provide his voice), and both episodes featured cameos by various recurring voice actors for the series. Plot\\"Stewie Kills Lois\\"= On Lois' birthday, Brian gives her a pair of cruise tickets with the intention of going with her. She invites Peter instead, disappointing Brian. Stewie is also upset at not being invited on the cruise, and he concocts a plan to embarrass Lois upon her return. Brian points out that Stewie has never followed through with any of his plans to hurt Lois. Stewie, disappointed in himself for being 'all talk', resolves to prove Brian wrong. Meanwhile, on the cruise, Peter proves to be a frequent source of humiliation for Lois, defecating on the poop deck and telling the story of how he and Lois almost aborted Meg to the ship's captain at dinner. Furious at Peter, Lois walks onto the deck to get away from him, but is confronted by Stewie, who has traveled to the ship via speedboat. He shoots her repeatedly with a submachine gun, sending her overboard. Six days later, Joe informs Peter that he has called off the search for Lois since he and his police squad are unable to find her. A year passes. Peter has begun dating again, some dates being a Stickman and Bonnie, but has talked Joe into posing as Lois from time to time so that her death doesn't emotionally scar Chris. Stewie indirectly reveals to Brian that he killed Lois. Disturbed and enraged, Brian vows to avenge Lois‚Äô death. Stewie realizes that keeping the evidence of his crime as souvenirs is too risky; thus, he disposes of his gun and drawings depicting Lois being killed. After Peter nonchalantly reveals that Lois' life insurance policy, which was made on the cruise right after she and Peter had an argument stating they wanted to kill each other, has recently been cashed for a large amount of money, Joe, Quagmire, and Cleveland begin to suspect Peter as Lois' killer. They search the Griffins' garbage and find Stewie's discarded gun and drawings. Joe becomes convinced that Peter was the one who killed Lois, given that Stewie and Peter have similar handwriting. Peter goes on trial for Lois' murder. Carter commits perjury under the authorities noses by falsely testifying against Peter, and Peter is close to receiving life in prison. However, Lois suddenly appears in the courtroom and reveals that Stewie, not Peter, tried to kill her. =\\"Lois Kills Stewie\\"= Following a brief recap by the Channel 5 News team, the episode picks up where \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" ended. Everyone is in disbelief that Stewie would try to murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and explains what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a reverse merman. Having developed retrograde amnesia, she started working at a fat camp in North Carolina. While at a diner, she met a new boyfriend, who turns out to be a white supremacist. While at a rally, she spoke out against them and took a blow to the head, regaining her memory, at which point she returned to Quahog. As Lois explains her miraculous return, Stewie escapes. He ties up his family when they return home, and he kills Cleveland when he drops by (Cleveland later arrives in Heaven only to find out about their prejudiced policy on credit card imprints). He kidnaps Brian and forces him to drive him to the CIA in Langley Falls, where he gains access to a supercomputer and takes control of the global power grid. The CIA submits to his demands, and Stewie becomes \\"President of the World\\" after encountering Stan Smith and Avery Bullock from American Dad. The Grffins escape as Stewie did not tie Chris' hands but did not say anything cause he enjoyed their time together and discover Stewie's armory where Peter and Lois switch bodies which Peter enjoyed due to having Lois' breasts. Upon his rise to power, Stewie implements harsh, cruel and unusual laws and policies, including banning direct-to-video Disney films and everyone must hit Peter with apples, and creating concentration camps housing prisoners for unfair crimes. Lois, unable to stand idly by as her son terrorizes the world, decides to assassinate him. After taking weapons from Stewie's own weapons vault, she engages him in a destructive battle in the Oval Office. Lois eventually gains the upper hand and prepares to kill Stewie, but cannot bring herself to murder her own child. Stewie takes the opportunity to disarm her, but, before he can kill Lois, he is shot and killed by Peter, who uses a one-liner from Lethal Weapon 2 only for Brian to comment that it did not fit the context of the situation. Peter and Lois mourn over Stewie's corpse. It is then revealed that what has happened was actually a computer simulation that Stewie created to see what would happen if he killed Lois. Brian comes into the room with postcards from Peter and Lois on the cruise, which is going well for them and finds Stewie coming out of the device. Stewie explains what he was doing, causing Brian to wonder if a hypothetical external viewer of the simulation would feel cheated by what was ultimately a \\"dream sequence\\", but Stewie argues that a computer simulation is totally different. Stewie then claims that he is not yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation, while Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation did not end like The Sopranos, where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, the scene cuts to black mid-sentence. Production Actor Patrick Stewart guest starred in \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\". \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" and \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" are the 102nd and 103rd episodes of Family Guy respectively. They are the fourth and fifth episodes of the sixth season of the show. \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" was written by executive producer and former Futurama writer David A. Goodman. The episode was directed by John Holmquist. \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" was written by recurring voice actor and future showrunner Steve Callaghan, and directed by Greg Colton. Colton and Callaghan previously worked on the season 5 episode \\"Whistle While Your Wife Works\\". Before the airing of the episode, a 100th episode tribute special, hosted by MacFarlane, aired on Fox. The special showcases various clips of MacFarlane's favorite moments from the last 99 episodes of the show. It also included MacFarlane asking people questions related to Family Guy. \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" and \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\", along with the final five episodes of the fifth season and the first seven episodes of the sixth season, were also released on DVD under the title \\"Volume 6\\" by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on October 21, 2008, five months after they had completed broadcast on television. The DVD release also features bonus material including deleted scenes, commentaries, and a 'making of' feature. Both episodes aired before the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and were the last episodes to air before it. In November 2007, Variety reported that MacFarlane had joined the strike and refused to complete more Family Guy episodes. A spokesperson for Fox said: \\"Our hope is that he returns to work and completes his non-writing obligations on those episodes\\". Fox aired two new episodes during November 2007. The following episode, \\"Padre de Familia\\", was the first of these two episodes to air. The strike ended on February 12, 2008 and the series resumed airing regularly. In addition to the main cast, actors Patrick Stewart and Phil LaMarr, and American Idol judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul guest starred in the episode. The episode also featured the recurring voices of actress Jennifer Tilly and Patrick Warburton, and writers Danny Smith and John Viener in minor appearances. Future showrunner Mark Hentemann also made some appearances. Cultural references When Stewie becomes disappointed that Lois did not take him on the cruise, he relates that he has not expressed it much since he saw The Lake House. Peter and Lois watch the sunset; Lois noting that she feels like Kate Winslet's character in Titanic, but Peter believes that she was portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Leonardo DiCaprio is also referenced in the scene. The cliffhanger ending where Lois returns to reveal Stewie as her attempted killer is a tribute to part one of the Star Trek: The Next Generation two-parter \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" with similar cliffhanger music and \\"To Be Continued...\\" title cards. Since they're both Trekkies, Seth MacFarlane and David A. Goodman had wanted to use the cliffhanger music from \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" if they ever got up to 100 episodes of Family Guy. Paramount wouldn't give them the rights, however, so composer Ron Jones, who wrote the music for \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" and several other episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, wrote and recorded the music heard in the episode. While looking for Stewie, Joe and other police officers travel to the Fortress of Solitude, where the maid Consuela works for Superman. Stewie is seen participating on American Idol in a cutaway, singing \\"Lost in Your Eyes\\" before judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul. American Dad! characters Stan Smith and Avery Bullock make a crossover appearance in \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" when Stewie hacks into the supercomputer. This crossover is extended on the Volume 6 DVD when, before the confrontation, Brian and Stewie first bump into Stan and Bullock in the restroom. The episode concludes with a reference to The Sopranos as the screen blacks out on Stewie criticizing the series' finale. The news anchor, Tom Tucker, copies Dennis Miller's signature phrase from Weekend Update on Saturday Night Live, saying, \\"Well, folks, that's the news, and I am outta here!\\" while drawing a circle on a paper. \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" features the recurring gag of the Kool-Aid Man bursting through the courtroom wall at an inopportune time, exclaiming \\"Oh yeah!\\" after a series of people in the courtroom say \\"Oh no!\\" in turn. The Kool-Aid Man then slowly backs out of the hole in the wall in embarrassment. This time, the judge implores the people of the court to please stop saying \\"Oh no!,\\" because, as he puts it, \\"The fucking Kool-Aid guy's gonna keep showing up!\\" \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" also mocks the varying quality of direct-to-video Disney films in general, in which a cutaway shows Jafar, the main antagonist in Aladdin, undergoing an eye exam. In addition, Lois is seen wearing John Rambo's combat outfit from Rambo III in her final battle against Stewie. Reception Ahsan Haque of IGN rated \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" a 9/10, while rating \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" a 9.4/10, saying \\"For the hundredth episode of Family Guy, Seth McFarlane and friends tackle the subject of one of Stewie Griffin's greatest ambitions ‚Äî his not-so-secret desire to kill his mother. For the disturbed fans waiting for some form of a matricidal manifestation, you can feel comfort knowing, without spoiling too much, that the youngest Griffin absolutely means business and ensures that he doesn't fail this time around. [...] There are some tense courtroom moments, a birthday celebration with the gift of Lionel Richie, a cruise ship, machine guns, and the reappearance of the Kool Aid Man that help round out this carefully crafted and well-told cohesive storyline. With the amount of cheap manatee jokes kept to a reasonable level, this episode also manages to find an excellent balance between comedy and storytelling. It's a fantastic way to celebrate the Family Guy one-hundredth episode milestone. [...] With the writers' strike in full effect, it seems that this might be the last new episode of Family Guy we'll be seeing for a while. It's a bittersweet way to end the abruptly short season as the quality is reminiscent of the series' brilliance from the early years and it seems like the show was really starting to hit its stride for the season. Hopefully the series will be able to live up to the high bar set by this two-part classic upon its eventual return.\\" Richard Keller of TV Squad gave \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" a much more negative review. He pointed out that the episode was hyped because before the episode aired a retrospective premiered featuring clips from the last 99 episodes, he stated that the episode was a huge disappointment. He stated that he did not find the episode funny, but rather disjointed, with little story and too many cutaway gags and flashbacks. In his review of \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\", Keller gave a much more positive review. He did mention that the end of the episode was somewhat predictable, as they had killed Cleveland and Stewie. He commented positively to some of the jokes of the episode, and in the overall he mentioned he liked the two episodes, but he was not so keen of the ending of the episode. On her review of \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\", Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+. She commented that it was \\"a bit weird\\" that the show was focusing on Stewie's desire to kill Lois, since in the last couple of seasons the Stewie and Brian dynamic had taken precedence, while Lois was being more foil to Peter than Stewie. She felt that most of the cutaway humor felt familiar and that there was no real moment that would deserve any callback status in future episodes. She did praise the cliffhanger, stating that she was intrigued about how the storyline would turn out. She also praised the storyline and liked how it was able to create drama. In her review of \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\", Koski rated the episode a B, calling the end of the story a bit predictable as she thought that the deaths of Lois, Cleveland and Stewie were a one time joke. She praised and disliked some jokes and gags in the episode, including Stewie demanding praise for his macaroni picture of an owl and Lois' salvation via merman, respectively. She commented that the fight sequence was extended and highly choreographed. \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" was voted #9, and \\"Stewie Kills Lois\\" was voted #8 on BBC Three's list of Top Ten Family Guy Episodes.

CIH's current Chief Executive is Gavin Smart.http://www.cih.org/ExecutiveTeam History The CIH traces its organisational roots back to the philanthropic work carried out by pioneers such as Octavia Hill, in response to the revelation of the appalling housing conditions endured by much of the population in the 1884-1885 Royal Commission on the Housing of Working Classes. Hill established a method of letting properties on short-term tenancies and trained a group of women to manage the properties by collecting rents and dealing with repairs and tenants' welfare issues.Chartered Institute of Housing History The Association of Women Housing Workers, founded in 1916, carried on this pioneering work and housing advocate Irene Barclay was a leading figure in it. The organisation changed its name to the Society of Housing Managers in 1948. The Institute of Housing was founded in 1931 by a group of local government offices in the West Midlands, who also developed a housing qualification and published the first edition of Housing magazine. The two merged in 1965 to form the Institute of Housing Managers. The organisation was renamed the Institute of Housing in 1974 and gained the appellation \\"Chartered\\" when its royal charter was granted in 1984. In 1999, CIH merged with the Institute of Rent Officers. CIH Today CIH‚Äôs Head Office is in Coventry, West Midlands, with smaller offices in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Hong Kong.
