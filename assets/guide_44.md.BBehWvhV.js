Its creation was part of the, ultimately futile, Habsburg attempt in the late 16th century to prevent incursion into the Caribbean by foreign powers. Spain also established Captaincies General in Cuba, Guatemala and Yucat√°n. The Captaincy General played a crucial role in the history of the Spanish Caribbean. The institution lasted until 1898 in Puerto Rico, when an autonomous local government, headed by a governor-general and an insular parliament, was instituted just months before Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 following defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. HistoryAntecedents= In 1508 Juan Ponce de Le√≥n was commissioned by the Crown to carry out the initial colonization of Puerto Rico. After successfully founding the city of Caparra (on the site of today's Guaynabo), he was appointed as its first governor in 1509 by the regent of Castile, Ferdinand V. Since Christopher Columbus's death in 1506, the Spanish Crown had refused to recognize his heirs' right to appoint governors of the West Indies, but in 1511 the Council of Castile ruled in Diego Col√≥n's favor. As a result, Ponce de Le√≥n lost his position and left the island, not wishing to serve under Col√≥n. The Columbus family appointed governors in Puerto Rico from then until 1536, when Diego's son, Luis Col√≥n sold the rights to govern the Indies to the Crown. In 1511, when Diego Col√≥n had won the right to appoint governors, the first diocese was established on the island under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Seville. (This diocese was later transferred in 1546 to oversight by the newly elevated Archdiocese of Santo Domingo. The Puerto Rico Diocese also supervised the church activities in the Province of Guayana in Venezuela from the 16th to 18th centuries.) From 1536 to 1545, the island was overseen by the president of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, who was also Captain General of the Caribbean. The island territory was administered locally, not as one unit, but by the alcaldes ordinarios of the two municipalities of the island, San Juan (a reconstituted Caparra) and San Germ√°n. These men were elected annually by the cabildos from among the local settler population. (The island was split along the Camuy and Jacaguas rivers.) Since most of the settlers did not have the training to become governors, the system proved ineffective. The island's Spanish residents complained to the Crown. Starting in 1545 governors with legal training (gobernadores letrados) were appointed by either the crown or the Santo Domingo Audiencia. Filling the highest judicial office on the island, the governors heard cases in the first instance in their immediate districts, and in appeal from the regional alcaldes. The next court of appeal was the Audiencia in Santo Domingo. In addition to being the highest administrative office on the island, governors also derived power from their right to annually appoint two of the four regidores of the cabildos on the island. As with all other Spanish political officials, governors were subject to the juicio de residencia, an official review of their time in office. Since governors were the king's highest representative on the island, they had oversight over the Church because of the right of patronage (real patronato) that the monarchs of Spain had in the Americas. They controlled the construction and maintenance of church buildings, paid the salaries of the clergy, and ensured that only Papal bulls and encyclicals approved by the Council of the Indies were published on the island. Due to Spain's growing military conflicts with other European powers, both in Europe and in the New World, the Crown added the office of captain general to the governor in 1580. Following this, mostly military men, rather than lawyers, were appointed as governors-captains general. They were assisted by a legal adviser (asesor) in their judicial and administrative duties. =Establishment= Spain considered Puerto Rico as vital strategically as the gateway to the Caribbean, even as it was economically marginal. It was described as \\"the key to the Indies.\\" Given the sea currents and wind patterns of the Atlantic, Puerto Rico was usually the first port of call for ships arriving from Europe. Despite this, or perhaps because of its negligible economic importance, the Spanish took a long time to build up the island's defenses. The first fortified building was the Ponce de Le√≥n family home (today the Casa Blanca), which defensive features were added in the 1520s. In the next decade construction began on the first true fort, La Fortaleza, at the entrance of the bay. By 1539 construction began of a full defensive complex around San Juan, which included Forts San Felipe del Morro, San Crist√≥bal, and San Ger√≥nimo. On the other side of the island, San Germ√°n was left practically defenseless, and was easy prey to French attacks throughout the century from its colonies in the Caribbean. With the creation of the Captaincy General in 1580, Governor-Captain General Diego Men√©ndez de Vald√©s (1582‚Äì1593) continued to strengthen defenses around San Juan. To fund the construction and an enlarged garrison, an annual subsidy, the situado, was ordered from the royal coffers in New Spain, although for the next two centuries, the situado often did not reach Puerto Rico. The number of permanent soldiers under Men√©ndez de Vald√©s went from fifty to just over two hundred, and was later raised to over four hundred in 1596, the number at which it would stay for the next century. The improvements to the city's defenses proved to be ready by the time they faced their first major challenge, an assault by a 27-ship fleet led by Francis Drake. The island would also serve as an important bastion in Spain's struggles against the piracy practiced by its rivals in the Caribbean; this continued to plague Spain during the next two centuries. Many Puerto Ricans also became Spanish privateers, who operated against the British, French and Dutch possessions in the area; the most famous privateer of these men was Miguel Henr√≠quez. During these periods of shifting formal and informal conflict, trading in contraband proved to be a crucial element of the local economy, as was common in many peripheral areas of Spanish America. It resulted in the siphoning off to foreign powers of most of the money that reached the island as the situado. To supplement the inadequate number of regular soldiers, local militias (milicias urbanas) were organized in each of the islands five districts (partidos) outside of the capital: San Germ√°n, Arecibo, Aguada, Coamo, Lo√≠za and Ponce. The militia men were not regularly paid nor were they armed by the government. Their weapons consisted of farm implements: machetes, improvised wooden lances and regular knives, but the governors-captains general usually attested to their courage. Each partido was overseen by a teniente a guerra, a deputy of the captain general. =18th century and the Bourbon Reforms= Shaken by the losses of the Seven Years' War, in particular the capture of Cuba by the British in 1762, Charles III sent several officials to the Caribbean to review the defenses of the area. Alejandro O'Reilly was sent to Puerto Rico in 1765. O'Reilly recommended many reforms, several of which were implemented: upgrading the fortifications in San Juan; introducing direct, regular pay for the soldiers on the island (up until then, soldiers had been paid by their commanding officers); and professionalizing the militias. He also undertook a complete census of the island (it recorded 44,883 residents, of which 5,037 were slaves; and 24 towns or villages in the island). In the course of this, he came to realize the importance of contraband in the local economy. To reverse this, O'Reilly recommended developing the legal economy, in particular agriculture, which he found vastly untapped. He wanted to return uncultivated land to the crown and then grant it to persons willing to farm it. In 1784 an intendancy was created in Puerto Rico but, unlike the one created in Cuba, the office was not separated from the governorship. O'Reilly's reforms were most successful in the military sphere. He was able to achieve little economic change, unlike that which took place in neighboring Cuba. The island's economy remained tied to the situado subsidy and foreign trade, something which proved harmful during the interruption in trade caused by the Napoleonic Wars. =Early 19th century: revolutions and setbacks= The early 19th century presented the dual challenge of Spain suffering invasion by French forces and revolt among its colonies in the Americas. The Peninsular War and the Spanish American wars of independence spurred great innovation in Puerto Rico's government. Puerto Rico's sea ties to Venezuela, due to sailing patterns which made the island the closest port of call from Venezuela, played significantly in this period. The juntas which were established in Venezuela in 1810 corresponded with the cabildos of Puerto Rico. The San Juan cabildo turned down the invitation from the Caracas junta to establish a junta on the island, but the San Germ√°n cabildo always maintained the right to self-rule, should Spain be permanently lost to the French. Some individual Puerto Ricans, such as Antonio Valero de Bernab√©, later chose to join the struggle for independence going on in the South American mainland. In response to the junta movement gathering strength on the mainland, the peninsular government gave Governor Salvador Mel√©ndez extraordinary powers to deal with any revolt on the island. At the same time, many royalist refugees from Venezuela began arriving in Puerto Rico. The island also served as a point of departure for troops on their way to Venezuela, such as those under Domingo de Monteverde and Pablo Morillo. As the government in opposition to the French began to take shape in the form of a Supreme Central Junta, it recognized the overseas possessions as integral parts of the Spanish nation. In 1809 it invited them to send delegates to the Junta. This initiated a period of elections in the Captaincy General which were of ever-increasing representation, culminating in the constitutional periods of 1812-1814 and 1820-1823. The first elections were to be carried out by the cabildos, of which there were five on the island by this time: San Juan, San Germ√°n, Aguada, Arecibo and Coamo. They elected as Puerto Rico's representative, the native Criollo Ram√≥n Power y Giralt, but before he could leave for Spain, the Supreme Junta had dissolved itself. Before it had done so, the Junta had sent the call out to convene the Cortes of C√°dizwhich served as a parliamentary Regency after Ferdinand VII was deposed. The cabildos elected Power as the island's representative in the Cortes. Power had a very active term in the Cortes. He quickly had the Cortes suspend the governor of Puerto Rico's extraordinary powers, and he also secured separation of the office of the intendant from that of the governor-captain general. The highlight of his legislative activity was the Ley Power (the Power Act), which introduced many administrative and economic reforms in Puerto Rico, many of which survived Ferdinand VII's abolition of the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and the Cortes. The Spanish Constitution also introduced local government to Puerto Rico. Many more popularly elected cabildos were introduced to the island. A local administrative and legislative board was also elected, the Diputaci√≥n Provincial. After the King of Spain restored traditional government, he sought to maintain and reward the loyalty of Puerto Ricans by granting the island a limited form of the long-sought free trade. The Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 granted many of the economic requests that Power and the island cabildos had requested since 1810. In the long term, the Decree had very beneficial economic effects. It encouraged the immigration of Europeans who were not of Spanish origin to the island, started the growth of the sugar industry (although this resulted in increasing importation of slaves), and a series of competent intendants set the island's government finances on good standing for decades to come. During the second constitutional period after the Riego Revolt, new deputies to the Cortes were elected by the island's population, the Diputaci√≥n Provincial met again. An important change from the first period was that the captaincy general and the governorship were separated. Francisco Gonz√°lez de Linares, a long-time Venezuelan resident who had fled after collapse of its royalist government, was appointed governor. Pablo Morillo's successor as head of the royalist forces in Venezuela, Miguel de la Torre, was appointed captain general. After Ferdinand VII's second abolition of the Constitution, La Torre was made joint governor and captain general, with extraordinary powers to suppress any potential revolt. He would hold the office of captain general for more than fifteen years. Despite La Torre's wariness of the island's liberal tendencies, his long administration was key to the development of large-scale sugar production on the island. This scale of commodity-crop agriculture had been developed decades earlier in Cuba. Figures from the period show the growth in this period. In 1820, 17,000 tons of sugar were produced and 5.8 percent of the land was under any type of cultivation. By 1897, Puerto Rico produced 62,000 tons of sugar and had 14.3 percent of its land devoted to agriculture. The small landholdings, which had been traditional since the 16th century, were purchased to develop large plantations. After sugar, coffee was the second most important crop. In 1818 70 million pounds of coffee were produced, a figure which grew to 130 million pounds by 1830. The increased agricultural activity was done partly by new slave labor, workers imported from other Caribbean islands. In 1817 Spain had signed a treaty with Britain ending the African slave trade, but it was not seriously enforced until after 1845.Anglo-Spanish Anti-Slave Trade Treaty But in Puerto Rico, slaves made up only 11.5 to 14 percent of the work force, a much lower proportion compared to other Caribbean islands of the time, .Morales Carri√≥n, Arturo, ed. Puerto Rico: A Political and Cultural History, 103-105. In judicial matters, Puerto Rico was granted its own audiencia from 1832 to 1853. Previously appeals had been heard by the former Audiencia of Santo Domingo, now resident in Cuba. =Mid-Century: Slow progress towards autonomy= The death of Ferdinand VII brought about new changes. Regent Mar√≠a Cristina reconvened the Cortes, in its traditional form, and Puerto Rico sent several deputies, all liberals. In 1836, Constitutional government was reestablished in Spain. This government, despite its liberal tendencies, viewed the overseas territories as colonies to be governed by special laws. The democratic institutions, such as the Diputaci√≥n Provincial and the cabildos, established by the 1812 Constitution were removed, and the extraordinary powers granted to the governor maintained. The new Constitution of 1837 ratified Puerto Rico's demoted status. Worse still the \\"special laws\\" by which the overseas areas were to be governed, were not drafted until three decades later, when a special Junta Informativa de Reformas de Ultramar (Overseas Informative Reform Board), with representatives from Cuba and Puerto Rico, was convened in 1865. Even then its proposals were never made into laws. The Gloriosa Revolt of 1868, which removed Queen Isabel II from power, initially reaffirmed the right of Puerto Rico's residents to participate in the Spanish government. The island elected seven deputies to the Cortes, the Diputaci√≥n Provincial once again was formed, and plans were made to draw up the laws which would grant the island autonomy. But three factors nullified this progress. First the government in Spain was too unstable (reflected in the fact that between 1871 and 1874 Puerto Rico had five governors). Second the short-lived revolt of Lares proved to authorities that the situation in Puerto Rico was not as calm as it might seem. Finally and most seriously, the Lares revolt coincided with the Ten Years' War in Cuba, which made the government apprehensive of granting autonomy to either of the Caribbean islands. In 1875, the Bourbons were restored when the Spanish government offered the throne to Alfonso XII. Limited elections, which granted the franchise only to people with large amounts of property, were allowed in Puerto Rico. True political parties also emerged in this period, the Partido Liberal Reformista, which promoted autonomy for the island, and the Partido Liberal Conservador, which pushed for the island's greater integration into the political system of Spain. The issue of autonomy came to a head in 1895 with the start of the Cuban War of Independence. The Overseas Minister, with approval from the Prime Minister, took the extra-constitutional step in 1897 of writing the Constituci√≥n Auton√≥mica, the new measures which granted autonomy to the Caribbean islands. Given the urgency of the movement, the government approved this unusual measure. The new government was to consist of \\"an Island Parliament, divided into two chambers and one Governor-General, representative of the Metropolis, who will carry out his duties in its name, the supreme Authority.\\"In Spanish: Autonomic Constitution of 1897 Elections for the parliament and the municipal councils occurred in early 1898.

Polevitzky (June 21, 1911 - May 5, 1978) was an American architect, most recognized for his contribution to the architectural styling of Miami Beach hotels, residences and the development of the tropical modern home in South Florida. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia June 21, 1911, Igor Polevitzky was the son of Russian electrical engineer Boris Alexander Polevitzky and Katherine Polevitzky, a physician and microbiologist. In November 1922, the family immigrated to the United States as it is believed the father had some involvement with the Russian Revolution. Polevitzky's mother Katherine, immediately received a research position at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where Igor was able to attend in 1929. His father receives a position at General Electric through a friend. Although he originally studied civil engineering for a year and a half, he was directed to the school architecture where he studied under the well-known architect and critic of Modern Classicism, Paul Philippe Cret; who was credited for having major influence on Igor. Polevitzky graduated cum laude in 1934, when the school remained Beaux-Arts throughout his stay. Upon his graduation in 1934, Polevitzky moved to Miami and began what would become his career focus on tropical design. Working with other modernists of the time in Miami, Robert Law Weed and classmate Thomas Triplett Russell (who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935), the firm began to bring a new Modernist approach to Miami and Miami Beach. At the time in Miami, the effects of the depression had begun to pass and the city was beginning to boom with population growth, tourism and a new regionalist architecture. The style was a response to the specific demands of the south Florida coastal climate by using innovative passive-cooling design strategies. \\"This singular integration of concepts of Modernism and regionalism defines the nature of Polevitzky's contribution to the aesthetic of the region.Shulman, Allan T. \\"Igor Polevitzky's Architectural Vision for a Modern Miami.\\" The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts 23 (1998).

Upon his return, he opened a new office where he formed a partnership with Verner Johnson, and so began in 1951, Polevitzky, Johnson and Associates in Miami. Long-time associates of the firm included William H. Arthur, Samuel S. Block, Jerome L. Schilling and illustrator J. M. Smith. Often-employed photographers included Robert R. Blanch, Jim Forney, Samuel H. Gottscho, Ernest Graham, Rudi Rada, Ezra Stoller and Earl Struck.Historical Museum of Southern Florida, Polevitzky, \\"Selected records from the 'Polevitzky' Archive\\", Boxes 1-9. 1986-222-775. The constant theme in the Polevitzky's work was termed as an \\"envelope for living,\\" which is characteristic of the many projects throughout Igor's career. One key concept maintained by Polevitzky through most of his career was the almost ambiguous blending of interior and exterior spaces which helped to relate the home to its immediate environment. Simple considerations like the sloping of roofs and extending overhangs on houses proved well suited for the intense sun and rain in tropical Miami. Then in 1939, Polevitzky introduced what he later termed, \\"the four stages of indoor-outdoor living\\" where his plans began to have a progression from the living room, to the dining room, into a screened porch and then outside; this became a common tool in his designs in years to come.Perrottet, Tony. Insight Guides: Cuba . Apa Productions. 1998. Pages: 140-141. Polevitzky designs more than 500 buildings during his Miami career. Havana Riviera Hotel Riviera, 1957. The Havana Riviera was originally commissioned by its promoter Meyer Lansky to be located on a traffic island near a high-income neighborhood along the Malec√≥n (a boardwalk that runs along the coast of Havana), and was to be designed by eminent architect Philip C. Johnson, then by Los Angeles Architect Wayne McAllister. The original project was called the Hotel Monaco and was designed in 1956.Arthur, William H. Igor B. Polevitzky and the Habana Rivera Hotel. Online Article. http://whaiv.us/polevitzky-and-the-habana-riviera, 2014 \\"According to the architect [Johnson], the project remained un-built because the demands of the promoter Meyer Lansky were impossible to meet.\\"Luis Rodriguez, Eduardo.

Pages: xvi, 140 Lansky quickly seeks Polevitzky, Johnson, and Associates in Miami where Igor offers to meet Lansky's unusual demands, and takes over the project. Considered Polevitzky's most influential project, the Havana Riviera is designed and constructed in six months. It was the culmination of all of his years of tropical regionalism and his experience in hotel design; yet it wasn't even in the city that he spent his career addressing. The hotel was one of the last great developments in Havana before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, and the first international project for the firm. Unfortunately, with the popularization of air-conditioning, many of his teachings were abandoned by the public in lieu of enclosed boxes of contained comfort. Alan T. Shulman, professor at the University of Miami explains, \\"Cosmopolitan, well-educated, analytically minded, but somewhat diffident, Polevitzky was one of the most respected but least appreciated of Miami architects. His work was considered intellectual and avant-garde, and although he was well published, he seems to have made little effort to explain or popularize his approach. Thus, his adventure in evolving an architecture for Florida was an inherently personal one.\\" Igor's own reaction to the Miami climate; he had a skin allergy that ironically kept him in air-conditioning most of the time forces him to move to a motel he owned in Estes Park, Colorado in the early sixties. Partially disabled and bound to a wheelchair from a cruise ship accident, Polevitzky dies in 1978, suffering from severe burns and smoke inhalation from a dropped match in his home.Arthur, William H. Igor B. Polevitzky and the Habana Rivera Hotel. Online Article. http://whaiv.us/polevitzky-and-the-habana-riviera, 2014 The predominance of Modernism in Miami tailored to the tropical climate is still very visible today, and in the 1950s, Polevitzky and Johnson were at the forefront.

M1915 Kugelhandgranate NA By 1915, German industry was preparing for a long war and resources were already becoming stretched, making it beneficial from both an economic and manufacturing point of view to design a replacement for the Kugelhandgranate Mod. 1913. The Kugelhandgranate Mod. 1915 (which was considerably easier to produce) was thus introduced and used from 1915 onward. Description The body of the grenade was cast iron 8 mm thick, spherical shaped and externally segmented designed to produce between 70 and 80 fragments. A bronze-like stick (which was the igniter) was introduced to the spherical body. The filling was a mixture of black powder, barium nitrate, and potassium perchlorate, and did not require a detonator. The friction igniter consisted of a bronze body with a central chamber filled with black powder and supplied with a 5 or 7 second delay, the powder train was topped with a priming wire made of brass with a loop at one end and serrated on the other. The serrated portion was coated with a mixture of ground glass, manganese dioxide, and potassium chlorate. Method of use To be used, the friction wire had to be pulled from the igniter, starting the delay train at the last possible moment. To do this, a piece of leather was attached to the igniter with a snap hook; pulling this removed the wire so the grenade could be thrown. A man with average strength could throw this grenade about 15 m.

Many green museums use their collections to produce exhibitions, events, classes, and other programming to educate the public about the natural environment. Many, but not all, green museums reside in a building featuring sustainable architecture and technology. Green museums interpret their own sustainable practices and green design to present a model of behavior. Green museums strive to help people become more conscious of their world, its limitations, and how their actions affect it. The goal is to create positive change by encouraging people to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. They use their position as community-centered institutions to create a culture of sustainability. DefinitionsMuseum= Museums make a \\"unique contribution to the public by collecting, preserving, and interpreting the things of this world,\\" according to the American Alliance of Museums‚Äô Code of Ethics. There are many types of museums that specialize in various fields, including anthropology, art, history, natural history, science, and can have living collections such as public aquariums, botanical gardens, nature centers, and zoos, or no collections like planetariums, and children's museums.American Alliance of Museums Retrieved 20 April 2008. Museums are stewards of natural heritage and cultural heritage by preserving objects of importance to mankind on the community and global level. Museums communicate and contribute to knowledge. They are mission-driven, serve the public, and usually have nonprofit legal statuses. =Green= In the concept of green museums, the word green means environmentally thoughtful practice. The terms \\"green\\" and \\"sustainable\\" are buzzwords often used interchangeably. However, according to Brophy and Wylie, \\"green\\" and \\"sustainable\\" have distinctly different definitions. \\"Green refers to products and behaviors that are environmentally benign, [...] while sustainable means practices that rely on renewable or reusable materials and processes that are green or environmentally benign.\\" Another frequently cited definition for \\"sustainability\\" that is used in various contexts was developed by the United Nations (1987): \\"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs.\\"\\"Report of the World Commission on environment and development. General Assembly Resolution 42/187, December 11, 1987,\\" United Nations Retrieved 21 May 2007. Sustainability reflects a complex system where components are closely linked and do not exist in isolation from one another. A sustainable system affects and is affected by the individual and collective behaviors of its members. Sustainability, therefore, recognizes the human impact on the environment, and aims to mitigate negative effects.Worts, D. (2006). Fostering a culture of sustainability. Museums & social issues, vol.1, no. 2, Fall 2006, pp. 151-172. =Culture of sustainability= Green museums promote a culture of sustainability. Culture forms and holds humanity‚Äôs deepest values, attitudes, and actions. Sustainability asks people to adapt at a cultural level, changing their beliefs and behavior (Worts, 2006). Museums are in a unique role to establish and promote a culture of sustainability. \\"In their role as places of authority and keepers of culture, museums have unequaled power and responsibility to model and to teach the methods of preserving ourselves, our planet and our cultural resources\\" (45).Brophy, S. & Wylie, E. (2006). It‚Äôs easy being green: Museums and the green movement. Museum News, September/October 2006, pp. 38-45. The California Academy of Sciences uses native plantings on its green roof to reduce heating and cooling energy requirements and contains many other energy and water saving features. It has been widely recognized as likely the \\"greenest\\" building currently on the planet.California (magazine of the University of California Alumni Association), Sept/Oct 2008, cover and pp. 52-53  History  Green museums are a relatively new phenomenon. Discussions within museums about environmental sustainability began in the 1990s and have continued to grow in momentum to the present day. Currently, green museums are receiving a lot of attention from academia and the mass media. Some scholars believe that a focus on sustainability is a way for museums to be relevant in the 21st century (Brophy & Wylie, 2006). However, most conventional museums are not engaged in sustainable practices.Sutter, G. C. (2006). Thinking like a system: Are museums up to the challenge? Museums & social issues, vol.1, no. 2, Fall 2006, pp. 203-218. The green museum movement began in science and children‚Äôs museums. Science museums found that environmental advocacy and education fit easily within their missions and programming. Children‚Äôs museums saw that using green design in their inside environments created a healthy playground for their young visitors. Once sustainability became a topic of discussion in museum circles, zoos and aquariums realized that their existing missions and programming of species conservation was in essence sustainable education.Wylie, E. & Brophy, S.S. (2008). The greener good: The enviro-active museum. Museum, January/February 2008. Recently, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums revised its accreditation standards to include a requirement of environmental advocacy.Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Retrieved 20 April 2008. With the green museum movement beginning in Children's Museums, The Children's Discovery Museum in Normal, IL, became the first LEED certified Children's Museum on October 3, 2005, when it received a Silver certification. The Wild Center in Tupper Lake, NY became the first LEED certified green museum in 2008, followed by The Brooklyn Children's Museum, who achieved the LEED Silver certification in 2010. In addition, this museum used rapidly renewable and recycled features such as bamboo and recycled rubber flooring to construct the building as well as used photovoltaics to generate electricity. Other good examples of green museums include The Boston Children's Museum who earned a LEED Gold certification in 2007, and Pittsburgh Children's Museum, who received a LEED Silver certification in 2006.https://pittsburghkids.org/about/green-museum Science museums and zoos were quick to follow Children's Museums in the green movement. One of the first science museums to adopt green initiatives was ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain in Burlington, Vermont, which was the first LEED certified building in Vermont. The Natural History Museum of Utah is another museum that has taken charge in the green museum movement. The Rio Tinto Center of the museum has been certified with a Gold LEED Certificate. https://nhmu.utah.edu/museum/our-new-home/sustainability Zoos and Botanical Gardens have also become leaders in the Green Museum field. The Denver Zoo, Woodland Park Zoo, and Cincinnati Zoo all received Green Awards at the 2011 Association of Zoos and Aquariums Conference. The Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens was given a LEED silver certification for its new Welcome Center, which \\"is designed to evoke the geometry of the historic glass houses behind it.\\" It has 11,000 square feet of lobby, ticketing, gift shop, and cafe space with a 34 ft high glass dome that is insulated to control glare and heat. Architects partially built the structure into the terrain, with 14th feet of usable space below ground. It was determined that by doing this, Phipps would save 40-50% of annual energy costs compared with an entirely above ground structure, and demonstrated that sustainable design could be created in ways that were still sympathetic to historic settings. Phipps will also be opening the Center for Sustainable Landscapes, which will house a center for education, research, and administration. It is scheduled to open in the spring of 2012, and is planned to exceed the LEED platinum certification, and achieve the Living Building Challenge. Art Museums are now also joining the movement. The Grand Rapids Art Museum became the world's first LEED certified art museum complex in 2008 when it received LEED Gold certification, which such innovative features as a heat recovery ventilator, CO2 sensors, and on site grey water reuse. Now all types of museums of all sizes are becoming green. In the last decade, over 20 American museums have constructed a new green building or have renovated an existing building with sustainable features. Many others have developed green operations or programming. Some scholars believe that environmental sustainability will become a professional expectation for all museums in the future (Wylie & Brophy, 2008). One specific example of a \\"Green Museum\\" is The Toledo Zoo in Toledo, Ohio. In 2007, the institution redefined its mission statement to focus on inspiring and informing the public about conservation.Klinger, Eric. \\"Building Green at the Toledo Zoo\\". http://www.aza.org/Membership/detail.aspx?id=778. As part of their new mission, the Toledo Zoo committed to green construction, which was shown in the parking lot renovation project. The main parking lot was redesigned in order to increase parking capacity and aid traffic flow, and the project incorporated green elements such as rain gardens and reusing concrete. The renovation also included a residential-sized wind turbine and three solar panels to power the ticket booths at the park's entrance. The wind-turbine and solar panels generate 3600 kilowatt hours per year, which can be redirected into the zoo's main power grid when the booths are not in use and reduce the zoo's carbon footprint by 5600 pounds annually. Another project at the Toledo Zoo is the Solar Walk. The Solar Walk opened in November 2010 and includes over 1400 solar panels that produce 104,000 kilowatt hours per year, the same amount of energy used by ten typical homes in Ohio.Waugh, Elise. \\"Going Green\\". August 18, 2011. http://zooexplorer.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/going- green/. The Toledo Zoo and the Solar Walk's design team wanted the project to be a visual reminder to all zoo visitors and traffic from nearby highway of the zoo's commitment to conservation. In order to accomplish the project, the Toledo Zoo turned to a local companies, and used funds from private contributions and an energy grant from ODOD to cover the $14,750,000 price.Grahl, Cindy. \\"Toledo Zoo Solar Walk: Walking on sunshine\\". http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=1156. Also, The Toledo Zoo, in keeping with their mission statement, included informational panels on how the Solar Walk works and the amount of energy produced to date, so that visitors can be informed on the conservational value of the project. The Solar Walk will reduce the Zoo's carbon footprint by over 75 metric tons each year, which is equivalent to 15 medium-sized cars.Raghuveer, Amulya. \\"Toledo Zoo dedicates new SolarWalk\\". http://www.northwestohio.com/news/story.aspx?id=541642. The Toledo Zoo has further committed to incorporate green construction into its building plans through geothermal wells, environmentally friendly insulation and other renewable energy and green construction materials. Green exhibits Museums are taking a more active approach to the project development of their exhibits. Children's museums initiated the green museum movement, mainly out of health concerns for the young visitors. Using toxic materials and chemicals on structures intended for children became a high worry for both the museum staff and parents. \\"In its 2004 expansion project the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh used only adhesives, sealants, paints, carpets, and composite wood that are certified formaldehyde free with near- zero off-gassing.\\" Before the reduce, reuse, recycle mantra became mainstream, a small number of museums had already begun promoting sustainable decision making thru exhibits. One museum in particular, the Boston Children's Museum, developed a concept known as \\"The Recycle Shop\\". In 1970, this exhibit promoted the benefits of using manufactured waste materials, and turning them into artistic creations. Students, teachers, and the general public were allowed to collect art materials not otherwise found in regular stores. The Recycle Shop closed its doors after several years in operation, due to the recycling program that was later introduced across the United States. Throughout the last several years, exhibit designers have expanded their businesses by building eco-friendly exhibits. Using environmentally safe materials such as low Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) paints, formaldehyde- free wood products and fiberwood (composite wood) are the trademark tools for defining green exhibits. Some exhibit furniture products are also constructed to be shipped for flat packing. This helps to decrease shipping costs, reduce packing material, increase fuel efficiency which minimizes the overall carbon footprint of the exhibition. How does a museum understand the criteria that is required, needed to build green exhibits? Organizations are working to develop a standard rating system, for the specific needs of green exhibitions. In 2007, Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) created an aid to help museums assess the sustainability of their exhibits. OMSI, a scientific, educational, and cultural resource center looked to the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, to create the OMSI Green Exhibit Certification. The guide provides a checklist for organizations who follows eight elements regularly used in exhibit design. After evaluation, they are awarded 0-4 points: # Rapidly Renewable Materials # Resource Reuse # Recycled Content # End-life Assessment # Low-Emitting Materials # Certified Wood # Conservation # Regional Materials There are other guides and checklists available online for museums that want to be active participants in the green community. The Madison Children's Museum in Madison, WI developed a checklist for museum exhibit designers and fabricators to create exhibits that showcase best practices for a healthier environment. Exhibit SEED is a larger project funded by the National Science Foundation titled Sustainability: Promoting Sustainable Decision Making in Informal Education. IssuesMission= Some scholars suggest that sustainability and green design are a natural extension of a museum's mission statement. Some museums choose to make sustainability a central part of their identity, writing their commitment to being green in their mission statements. Sustainability can be seen as relating to three aspects included in most museum missions: field of research, purpose of public service, and the mandate for education. Museums that model green behavior enhance their missions and support their communities.Barrett, M. J. & Sutter, G. C. (2006). A youth forum on sustainability meets The Human Factor: Challenging cultural narratives in schools and museums. Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education, January 2006, 9-23. Not all green museums feel sustainability directly aligns with their missions. For example, an art museum that resides in green building and does not interpret its sustainable practices can be considered a green museum.Bernstein, F. A. (2007). From Michigan: A clean- running museum. The New York Times, Wednesday, March 28, 2007, H 18. =Education= As informal education centers that serve the public, museums are in a position to teach about sustainability to a large audience in meaningful ways. Through a combination of motivation and information, green museums try to initiate changes in behavior in people‚Äôs everyday lives. Green museums lead by example by explaining to visitors what sustainable activities they are doing and why through signage, programming, and websites. The goal is that visitors will learn about sustainable practices at the museum and then be able to implement them at home.greenexhibits.org Retrieved June 3, 2007. Many museums dedicated to sustainability and conservation education often utilize the works of theorists like Richard Louv and David Sobel to find the most effective ways to motivate their audiences to conservation action. For instance, Disney's Animal Kingdom cites Richard Louv's Nature Deficit Disorder as one justification for their Kids' Discovery Clubs, which focuses on encouraging children to not only learn about animals but also find out what they can do to help wildlife.Balavage, S. Dr. Heimlich, J. Kocanjer, N. Lehnhardt, K. Dr. Mellen, J. Assessing young Children's Learning within an informal setting at Disney's Kid's Discovery Clubs, IZE Journal NR. 25 - 2009 Another museum to cite Louv's Nature Deficit Disorder for their programming is the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. They spearheaded the national Take a Child Outside Week, which encourages children and adults to spend time together outdoors. Many museums also approach sustainability issues with Ecophobia in mind. Ecophobia is David Sobel's theory that if you introduce abstract and difficult environmental issues to children at too early of an age, and with out the proper background knowledge, they will retreat from nature.Diane M McKnight. 2010. Overcoming ‚Äúecophobia‚Äù: fostering environmental empathy through narrative in children's science literature. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 8: e10‚Äìe15. An example of a museum attempting to overcome Ecophobia would be one that promotes a love of nature and presents a variety of actions guests can take to help the environment before presenting them with more controversial and abstract environmental and sustainability issues. The Brooklyn Children's Museums respects the developmental stages of children by using their LEED certified building to teach children and their families about environmental conservation through interactive, age appropriate exhibits and activities.Biodiversity . The Brooklyn Children's Museum Goes Green. May‚ÄìJune 2004. =Social responsibility= In recent years, calls for museums to become sustainable institutions have come from within the museum field as a way for museums to achieve social responsibility and civic engagement. Sustainability is an opportunity for thoughtful, proactive museum work. \\"Museums can play a critical role in moving the communities they serve towards a more sustainable future. Aligning their missions and programs with sustainability principles... ...will recalibrate their own daily practices as well as awaken their community to the array of choices perhaps otherwise invisible to them\\" (183).Link, T. (2006). Models of sustainability: Museums, citizenship, and common wealth. Museums & social issues, vol.1, no. 2, Fall 2006, pp. 173-190. Museums, as a trusted part of the informal education system, are able to address the economic, cultural, and social dimensions of sustainability.Sutter, Glenn C. ‚ÄúPromoting Sustainability: Audience and Curatorial Perspectives on ‚ÄúThe Human Factor.‚Äù‚Äù Curator 51, no. 2 (April 2008): 187-202. They achieve this by engaging the public with interactive exhibits and by publicizing their own green efforts. The goal, stated or unstated, is to educate patrons about the effect they have on their environment, the ecological, economic, and cultural risks taken when they ignore their impact on the world, and introduce ways that they can reduce their carbon footprint. Thus, museums achieve civic engagement and social responsibility through teaching. Some museums, such as the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Saskatchewan, Canada, take a global approach to civic engagement. The Royal Saskatchewan Museum's green exhibit is titled The Human Factor and aims to show patrons the human ecological impact on the planet, what practices they can adopt to lessen this impact, and project what the future will be if humans do not take action. Visitors are helped to understand what Earth looked like before humans and gradual human impact over time through colorful depictions in the \\"Time Tunnel\\". The subsequent gallery, \\"Living Planet\\", explains how a global ecosystem functions and what human stresses are to the Earth's global ecosystem on a rotating globe. Specifically identified as a stress to the global ecosystem is the rising population. Curators placed clocks in the exhibit that count increases in population across the globe. Beneath the clocks are the forms of humans and in their shadow is the images of industrial productivity. The following gallery, \\"Causes of Stress,\\" identifies the source of ecological stresses as rampant consumerism and explains what causes this extreme behavior. The solutions gallery depicts sustainable development and an electronic display of sustainability success stories. This is an effort to show patrons how their choices impact not only themselves and their parts of the world but other people and their environments. The last gallery, \\"Looking Ahead,\\" describes the projected future of the globe if humans adopt the prescribed changes. The desired effect is an emotional response to the human impact on the global ecosystem. The Bronx Zoo seeks to educate its patrons about water resources and the impact of restroom use on water resources through the EcoRestroom exhibit. At the same time, by installing this restroom with composting toilets the Zoo has reduced its carbon footprint. The restroom serves men and women with 12 toilets and six sinks for women and two toilets, four waterless urinals and four sinks for men.Bhatt, Sonal. ‚ÄúInterpreting a Green Scene: The Bronx Zoo‚Äôs Eco-Restroom.‚Äù Exhibitionist (Spring 2009): 39-42. The sinks do not rely on electricity or battery power; rather, they recharge as water runs through them. The used water runs into a Grey Water garden that is unharmed by the bio-compatible soap available for use by patrons. The restroom doubles as exhibition space, informing visitors of water conservation. Along the pathway to the entrance of the restroom there are water-droplet-shaped signs that give visitors tips for conserving and repurposing water at home. Signs continue over the sinks, providing visitors with facts about water use meant to inspire thought about their own use and what they can do to use less water. Signs on the inside of the stall doors inform visitors how composting toilets function and the impact they have on the environment. This installation not only shows patrons how they can make simple changes to conserve water but implements those changes in real time at the Zoo. In educating, the Zoo is also making a difference. As stewards of the public trust, Museums bear a responsibility to maintain collections utilizing the most efficient methods available. Museums must do their part to ensure that there is a public to enjoy the collection and resources to exhibit the collection. One way museums can conserve resources is to incorporate energy saving practices into their daily operations, altering the facilities they already inhabit rather than building anew.Brophy, Sarah S. and Elizabeth Wylie. ‚ÄúSaving Collections and the Planet.‚Äù Museum 88, no. 6 (November/ December 2009): 52-7, 59-60. Brophy and Wylie identify simple solutions such as installing motion sensors that turn the lights on when visitors enter the gallery and turn the lights off when they exit, such as those found at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Those light bulbs could even be replaced with long-lasting LED bulbs. Other museums that manipulate their facilities location include the Morgan Library, as identified by Brophy and Wylie, whose storage is \\"carved out of Manhattan bedrock.\\" The bedrock provides natural cool storage without using electricity to generate an air conditioned climate. Thus neither money nor electricity are spent to control the climate of the storage space, which stresses not only museum funds but increasingly scarce electricity too. Museums achieve further social responsibility through implementation of sustainable practices that they advocate in building or altering facilities such that they are sustainable. This includes using LEED building practices and sourcing materials locally. Purchasing building materials and employing local labor stimulates the economy in the vicinity of the museum. It also reduces the carbon footprint of construction; materials purchased from local suppliers do not need to be delivered on a tractor-trailer, on an airplane, or on a ship, all of which consume fuel, time and money. The Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver, CO, has incorporated locally sourcing materials into its LEED-Gold design plan.Mirel, Diana. \\"The Art of Sustainability.\\" Journal of Property Management 73, no. 4 (Jul/Aug 2008): 8-9. The Museum highlights that its green roof, furniture fixtures and equipment have all been locally sourced. The museum also encourages the use of public transportation by offering discounts to visitor who use this as a means of accessing the museum. In building to the LEED Gold standard, the Museum of Contemporary Art has also made its operations more energy efficient. The facade is built to maximize climate control and limit the use of traditional forced air. Radiant flooring circulates heat around the perimeter of the building. These are two ways that MCA Denver conserves energy. The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego purchased paint, office furnishings, windows and doors from local vendors.\\"Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego.\\" Architectural Record 195, no. 6 (June 2007): 66. By educating the community and putting advocacy into action, museums become socially responsible. Landscapes and outdoor spaces One approach green museums are taking to improve sustainability is to consider their outdoor spaces and landscape design. Greening outdoor spaces provides multiple benefits beyond aesthetics and museums are increasingly using their outdoor spaces to further sustainable strategies and educational goals. According to the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities, there are many types of educational, recreational, and social skills that may be successfully taught outdoors.Gordon, Douglas. Cheryl Wagner. Planning School Grounds for Outdoor Learning. National Clearing House for Educational Facilities. October 2010 Outdoor museum spaces include pathways, trails, pavilions, picnic areas, fountains, courtyards, waste management areas, rooftops, and the greater surrounding environment. Whether a new facility or an existing one, green museums use these outdoor areas to implement sustainable practices. For instance, incorporating native plants, wetlands, bioswales, rain gardens, butterfly gardens, vegetable gardens, and green roofs are all ways museums can maximize the use of, and green their grounds. Additionally, the natural surrounding environment can be an integral part of the green museum (where the land is part of the museum). Incorporating these outdoor spaces provides a more flexible learning environment with greater educational opportunities. Outdoor spaces allow for hands-on projects that promote environmental awareness and are an ideal catalyst for community involvement.SITES, \\"Michigan Chapter of the American Society of Landscape Architects\\" Volume 5 Number 1. 2011 Increasingly, green museums are incorporating sustainable thinking in their outdoor planning. For example, the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum designed a rooftop that won the 2003 Chicago Green Roof Award. The living portion of the roof reduces the volume of storm water runoff and solar panels generate electricity used by the museum below.http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources/lifestyle_community&id;=7446270 The ability to quantify the performance of outdoor spaces is important to be a trusted example in the green museum community. There are multiple rating systems and interactive tools online and there is a growing consultancy field aimed at helping museums audit, develop baselines, and benchmark their performance. One strategy for museums going green is to become LEED Certificated. In 2000, the US Green Building Council (USGBC) introduced the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system that ranks sustainability in buildings and operations. To date, LEED is focused mostly on structures and development, while landscape issues are minimally addressed. The Sustainable SITES Initiative (SITES) is a new benchmark and rating system that was created, as a joint venture by the American Society of Landscape Architects, the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center and the United States Botanic Garden. Modeled after the LEED program, SITES is a work in progress to establish benchmarks and a rating system that addresses site selection, landscape design, construction, operations, maintenance and monitoring. Currently SITES is in the pilot project phase, and will be completed in June 2012. In November 2009, SITES released \\"Guidelines and Performance Benchmarks 2009\\" for the pilot projects which includes the rating system with five areas of focus; hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well- being. While LEED focuses on energy, the key to SITES is ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are benefits provided by natural ecosystems such as: *Climate regulation *Clean air, soil, water *Water supply regulation *Soil erosion / sediment control *Habitat and pollination *Decomposed waste integration *Human health and well being *Food and organic products *Cultural, educational, and aesthetic value *Flood impact mitigation, among others. SITES shows that when assessing overall sustainability, the museum landscape is equally important to the building structure. However, like any operational decision, the appropriate sustainable design techniques must balance with the museum's mission. It helps to articulate what learning outcomes are involved and what the long-term plan is for the outdoor space. Lighting in museums Lighting is an essential component for museums because museums use it to illuminate objects, offices, bathrooms, entrances, storage, and nearly every other space in a museum. As important as light is for a museum, some light can cause negative effects on objects such as paintings, textiles, leather, photographs, books and paper, or mounted specimens. Light damage is cumulative and irreversible, so museums must take special care to avoid unnecessary light damage. The spectrum of light is separated into three categories: ultraviolet light (UV), visible light, and infrared light (IR). Ultraviolet light is most damaging to objects, while infrared light produces heat which also causes damage. Museums generally use halogen or metal halide track lighting in galleries and fluorescent light in storage; however, these are not energy efficient options. Halogen lights waste energy by creating four times the amount of heat as a regular incandescent light and can become fire hazards. In a world where the use of more energy-efficient products is on the rise, museums have more opportunities than ever to cut down on the amount of electricity they use. The challenge to the lighting designer is to achieve a balance between creating interesting and desirable spaces, maintaining visual comfort and health of the visitor, while adhering to energy conservation goals.\\"A Lighting Study of Three Museums\\"_ http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/sf_museums/museum.html Lighting is a constantly changing field, especially with new innovations in green technology and energy-efficient options. The lighting options for museums available today will radically change in the next ten years. =Lighting options= Beyond halogen and incandescent light options, museums use LEDs, CFLs, fiber optics, hybrid solar lighting and natural light. *LEDs- LED stands for light emitting diodes which are illuminated by the movement of electrons in a semi-conductor material. LEDs consume one fifth of the energy of conventional bulbs (incandescent) and last one hundred times longer. While LEDs can be more expensive than incandescent, they use less energy and are more cost effective. LEDs produce no UV light, little heat, and can be used to illuminate objects. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that rapid adoption of LED lighting over the next 20 years in the United States could save about $265 billion in energy costs. *CFLs- Introduced in the 1980s, compact fluorescent light bulbs use gas that is stimulated with an electric current to produce light. CFLs use less energy than an incandescent and last six to ten times longer. CFLs contain mercury so disposing of them can be very complicated. Museums need to have special disposal methods when using CFLs. *Fiber Optics- Fiber optic lights use plastic or glass fibers to distribute light. The heat source is removed from the end of the fiber and the longer the length of the fiber, the more loss of heat at the end. Glass fibers dissipate UV light, but plastic fibers need UV filtering. *Hybrid Solar Lighting- Hybrid solar lighting combines solar power and fiber optics to channel sunlight into an enclosed space while directing infrared light into a concentrating thermo- photo-voltaic cell that converts to electricity. Sunlight is tracked by a parabolic disk and sensors maintain a constant level of illumination by supplementing sunlight with traditional electric light in special hybrid lighting fixtures. Hybrid solar lighting is more efficient than photo-voltaic cells. *Natural Light- Numerous museums use natural light instead of artificial light to illuminate spaces. However, sunlight can be the most damaging form of light because of the UV emitted. Natural should be considered in spaces that do not contain light sensitive materials: lobbies, offices; or in museums that do not contain light sensitive objects. Museums can also use UV filters on windows to lessen the harmful effects of sunlight. One rationale for using natural light is predicated largely on economics; a greater reliance on daylight reduces energy consumption and costs. Recent studies provide further justification that natural light generally creates a more positive effect on spaces than electric light and improves human performance. With properly installed and maintained daylighting systems, natural light has proved to be beneficial for the health, productivity, and safety of building occupants.L. Edwards and P. Torcellini. \\"A Literature Review of the Effects of Natural Light on Building Occupants,\\" National Renewable Energy Laboratory, July 2002 *Brise soleil is a natural lighting option that uses permanent architectural sun-shading techniques to reduce the amount of light that enters a building or a museum. *Motion Sensor and Task Lighting- Museums can use motion sensor or task lighting in areas with less traffic or in office spaces. Lighting entire areas that are used rarely or less often than other high traffic spaces is a drain on energy and money for a museum. These lighting options allow for light and energy to only be used when a person is engaged in a specific task or in a certain area. Greening the field of preventive conservation The needs of conserving artifacts and landmark buildings are often seen as conflicting with the most efficient and effective means of ‚Äúgoing green.‚Äù Light, temperature, humidity, pollutants, particulates, and pests must all be monitored in order to properly preserve objects and historic buildings - the energy spent to control and maintain ideal environments for historic building and artifacts alone is staggering. Since the heart of authenticity for many types of museums is the display of artifacts and specimens from their collections, it can be challenging to create ideal environments for these objects while also creating greener museum buildings and exhibition spaces. For example, the California Academy of Sciences, which is housed in a LEED Platinum building designed by Renzo Piano, utilizes a natural ventilation system that could expose its collections to airborne flora and fauna, fluctuations in temperature and humidity, and strong daylight. In order to combat these factors, Jonathan Katz, CEO of Cinnabar, Inc., the firm that was hired by the California Academy of Sciences to design exhibits for the main floor of its new Natural History building, devised a ‚Äúkit of parts‚Äù system where specimen display cases themselves could be configured to control temperature, humidity, and light. These cases had to reflect the sustainability mission of the museum and thus had to be built in such a way that they could be reconfigured and reused as exhibits changed. This is simply one example of how the perceived conflict between green exhibition and building design and the preservation of objects was resolved. The struggle to reconcile green practices and object conservation goes far beyond the exhibition hall, as most museums only display a fraction of the objects in their collections. Museum conservators are tasked with the care, preservation, and restoration of these objects ‚Äì the American Institute for Preservation, a professional organization in the United States that establishes and upholds professional standards among its members, states that the goal of its conservators is ‚Äúto preserve the material evidence of our past so we can learn from it today and appreciate it in the future.‚Äù In striving to be ‚Äúgreener,‚Äù conservators must also now ‚Äúconsider not only the interaction of materials and environment with the art and artifacts [they] treat, but also the use, production, and disposal of the materials [they] employ in [their] work.‚Äù Thus, another problem facing conservators is the issue of finding non-toxic or lower VOC replacements for tried and true conservation treatments. In order to fully understand the challenges associated with green conservation practices, then, it is helpful to examine what conservation professionals identify as core issues.

It was an all-white school until its court-ordered integration in 1959. Black students formerly attended Burley High School. When Lane became too small to accommodate the student body, it was replaced by Charlottesville High School. In 1981, the building was converted for use as the Albemarle County Office Building, for which it has remained in use until the present day. The structure was designed by Lynchburg, Virginia architect Pendleton Scott Clark. African American homes and African-American Episcopal chapel were removed to make way for the school. It was named after the former teacher and school superintendent James Waller Lane. Massive resistance On September 10, 1958, federal courts ordered public schools in Charlottesville to integrate their racially segregated schools. In response, Virginia Governor James Lindsay Almond, Jr. ordered nine schools in Virginia to close, including Lane, under the authority of a series of state laws known as the Stanley Plan, a part of the state's Massive Resistance policy. The school remained closed from September 19, 1958 until February 4, 1959, when Governor Almond reversed the state's policy and ordered the schools reopened and integrated. During this period, \\"local residents were subjected to emotional appeals, threats, and predictions of dire consequences representing all points of view concerning segregation.\\" Three African American students enrolled at Lane on September 8, 1959 without incident. Historian John Hammond Moore believes that the process of integrating Lane extended until approximately 1969, writing that it \\"was characterized by racial friction in some schools, notably Lane, but little actual violence.\\"  Integration era  In the late 1960s, left-wing students at Lane formed a Student Liberation Union. Issues of Blast, a photocopied radical newspaper, circulated among the student body. It was named after the famous modernist publication, Blast. This joined Lanetime, the mainstream student newspaper. Blast contained mostly anonymous articles on a range of topics, including city politics, national activism, and censorship, and brought the national conversation about race and civil rights to Charlottesville's high school students. In the first issue, an article by \\"LeRoi\\" announced, \\"Just as the oppressor must do in Vietnam, in the Ghetto, in the United States, and here at Lane High, he must allow the oppressed to determine their own destiny.

It is found from central Queensland south to southern New South Wales. It has become naturalised in the Everglades in Florida where it is considered a weed. Taxonomy Franz Sieber described the swamp oak as Casuarina glauca in 1826. The species name is derived from the Latin glauca \\"glaucous\\". The Kabi name for the plant, bilai, was used for the town and locality of Bli Bli, Queensland. The gadigal name is guman. It is closely related to C. cunninghamiana. Hybrids with C. cunninghamiana subsp. cunninghamiana have been recorded where the two species co-occur, such as at Lower Portland and Wisemans Ferry. Description closeup of new growth, showing segmented branchlets with tiny brown teethlike leaves at nodes of segments The swamp oak grows as medium sized tree, 8‚Äì20 m high tree, or rarely over 30 m tall. It can be restricted to a stunted shrub around 2 m (7 ft) tall when exposed to the elements on clifftops. The greyish brown bark has scales and small fissures. The branches have numerous drooping branchlets that are up to 38 cm long, and composed of small cylindrical segments known as articles. These articles are 8 to 20 mm long and 0.9‚Äì1.2 mm wide. The leaves themselves are reduced to tiny 'teeth' that are 0.6 to 0.9 mm long. 12‚Äì17 (rarely 20) teeth arise from the nodes between articles on the branchlets. The oval cones are 9‚Äì18 mm long by 7‚Äì9 mm wide. Distribution and habitat Casuarina glauca is found along Australia's east coast from Yeppoon in central Queensland to Bermagui in southern New South Wales. Some stands within the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney predate European settlement. Populations along the New South Wales coastline are at risk due to clearing of habitat for development. It has become highly invasive in Florida. Casuarina glauca grows in or near brackish water along the banks of rivers and estuaries. Suckering from the roots, the swamp oak can form dense stands of trees. It grows on alluvial soils of sandstone or shale origin. The water table lies 30 cm or less under the surface. This tree then acts to turn shallows into land by preventing erosion and collecting material among its roots. Ecology C. glauca is an actinorhizal plant producing root nitrogen-fixing nodules infested by Frankia. There is a regular pattern of cell layers containing flavans. Although not a legume, C. glauca, produces a hemoglobin (not a leghemoglobin) in its symbiotic root nodules. The rat's tail orchid (Dendrobium teretifolium) grows on the swamp oak. The larvae of the she-oak moth, Pernattia pusilla, feed on C. glauca. Casuarina glauca trees can live to 100 to 200 years. Trees regenerate after fire by growing from the roots. Cut stumps sprout suckers vigorously, producing groves of new trees. Casuarina glauca trees drop large amounts of litter, mainly old cones and branchlets, which eventually rots down and enriches the soil unless removed by a flood event. Understory plants recorded from swamp oak groves include Juncus kraussii, Baumea juncea and Sporobolus virginicus on sandier soils and Apium prostratum, Carex appressa, Goodenia ovata, Juncus kraussii and Phragmites australis and the vine Parsonsia straminea on clay soils. Glossy black cockatoos break the cones to eat the seeds, which mature in winter. The seed is eaten by the red-browed finch, and peaceful dove (Geopelia placida). Cultivation and uses Casuarina glauca has been planted widely as a street tree in Canberra. It was introduced to Haiti to stabilise the soil and to be used as timber for poles, and to Florida where it was planted as an ornamental plant and windbreak. The bark has been used to plant orchids on. It tolerates waterlogged soils and even soils with some salinity. A significant inconvenience in urban settings is that its roots can invade underground water and sewer pipes if these are within 15 m (50 ft) of the tree. It can also acidify acid sulphate soils as it lowers the water table. Two prostrate forms are commercially available: Casuarina 'Cousin It' is a cultivar arising from material from Booderee National Park on the New South Wales south coast collected in 1989 and named for its resemblance to Cousin Itt, and C. ‚ÄòKattang Karpet‚Äô is propagated by the Australian Botanic Garden from material collected at Kattang Nature Reserve on the New South Wales mid-north coast in 1998.

Introduction The Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Greyfriars records the systematic hounding of the Franciscans out of Denmark between 1527 and 1532. In all, 28 towns drove the friars from their friaries, often with the approval and encouragement of Frederik I of Denmark and his son, Duke Christian, later King Christian III. The chronicle describes the expulsion of the Greyfriars from 15 of them and mentions one more in passing. The chronicle's author or more likely authors, Franciscan Friar Erasmus Olai (Rasmus Olsen) and Friar Jacob Jensen of N√¶stved Friary, wrote an account of the tribulations of the monks and to condemn the cruelty of those who drove them from their houses. The chronicle is not objective; it is vehemently anti-Lutheran, and certainly lionizes those who were being persecuted, but the details the authors provide give first-hand insight into a turbulent time period in Danish history. Introductory Prayer Concerning the Greyfriar's expulsion. A prayer against the heretics and the devil's schemes. O Lord, God of the heavenly hosts, turn and look down from heaven specifically with a compassionate eye and see specifically our tribulation which we have suffered for our sins, and visit this vine, namely the Greyfriar's Order. And bring to an end (our tribulation), which (he who) sits at your right hand, even the only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, because it now in great part is fallen away; this vine, namely the holy order, is grounded upon the son of Man even the Virgin's son, who established yourself, even upon the sure rock, Christs. This vine I say is being fooled by heretics and false preachers, and set afire by trials and errors and undermined, even torn away from the true faith. Therefore, I ask, Lord, God of the hosts of heaven, that these false preachers might perish by the threat and indignation from your angry countenance, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. This (as mentioned) in Psalm 79 (80). The Chronicle Now follows a chronicle or a short account of the case of the Greyfriars expulsion from their friaries in the Province of Denmark. First an explanation of that: 'God's judgement is a deep abyss.' (Psalms 36:7) How true the words of the psalmist are; one can all too often see in our (time). O the pains,(of this) all too often unhappy and storm-filled age where one can see the Lutheran party's miserable expectations take hold. They have forsaken the (appointed) interpreters' true explanation of the holy scriptures, so that they with cunning and slyness and in a quarrelsome manner wrest the scriptures. They become stiff-necked by holding fast to their error (which) they drank in at first, to condemnation for themselves and for others. Because their lying master, Martin Luther, has asserted that faith alone was enough to save and that one had only to see to it that (faith) grew. But works, he asserted, were done only for dead flesh and to edify (one's) neighbor, but not to righteousness or salvation. Nor would there be any reward hereafter for mankind's holy works, but that works were only a preparation for faith which all the righteous were given, and taken away from the wicked. That interpretation is and has done much to foster laxity, O, that can one see more of in our time than is necessary to produce evidence of without long and extensive research. For many who before burned brightly in their devotion and zeal for the faith and despite their determination to never to forsake it, cooled, and went out completely with this devilish wind gust. For many who at one time were devoted under the holy father Francis' rule and stood like Lebanon's cedars, hurtled down in that they gave way before the misfortunes, like shrubbery on flat fields (give way) before the force of the wind. The majority ending their days in a very unhappy manner. Nearly all Denmark's great nobles were led away by their bad examples and pestilent dogma. And our order's poor brothers who are steadfast in the faith and preach against the Lutheran party's doctrines. They Greyfriars) are persecuted without compassion and against all just laws and driven from their friaries. And they (the fallen brothers) take away the alms and remove the religious decorations from the friaries, which property they took which (belonged to the friaries) and then use them for worldly purposes, thinking that they bring God an offering from the heart. For so they are taught by the heretic preachers. They assert that the offering of mass which has always been celebrated and which should be celebrated in the church is so abominable and so pernicious that is a wonder that such priests of the mass are not by God's punishing judgement swallowed up alive by the earth. their supposed heresy lifted from them whose god is (their) belly. Among them Mogens Gjo can be seen who was the first, he who in the most unjust manner drove our poor order's brothers from many places. Chapter 1 Concerning the Friary in Flensborg But in the year 1528 after the Saviour of the world's incarnation (on) the second day after Palm Sunday1, the above-mentioned Mogens Gj√∏, and his priest by the name of Svend came to Flensborg (in order to), with the citizens help, drive our brethren out of that town's friary. He and a considerably large host of citizens trespassed into our friary and demanded the keys from the Guardian, Brother Stig Nielsen, who came from Sk√•ne, from the town of Lund. He delivered the keys of the friary immediately to him (the priest, Svend). And he (Stig Nielsen) and the Vice-Guardian, Brother Andreas Hoffmand and another Vice-Guardian Brother Johannes Johansen who was from Flensborg, received each 4 guilder2 in travel money, which they accepted. But thereafter came the turn of lay brother, Hans, who as the master of the cellars with responsibility for the common food stores. From him they demanded the keys, but he assured them that he could not deliver the keys without ruining the beer, which had recently been put into the cellar, and said that he would retain them (the keys) for a time and serve Mogens Gj√∏ faithfully if what the priest, Svend, had said was true, that all the friars would be expelled from Denmark within the year. When that assurance was given, he went in to the cook, Brother Andreas Gad. He praised his (Hans') opinion and answered that he would do the same. The presiding brethren received permission to remain in the friary until the next day and a few of the court servants were set to keep watch over things. But early the next day there came the noble knight, Herr Wolf, who at that time was governor of Flensborg Castle to the friary. He had heard the sorrowful rumours about our friary and asked the guardian if they were to have a new guardian. He answered that such was the decision. For they had had as superintendent a citizen from Vejle whose house had burned down. Herr Wolf chased him (the previous superintendent) out of the friary and returned the keys to the Guardian2. After these events, the brethren remained in their friary until Trinity Sunday and served God. They deposited the money they had received when they were to have been expelled, in the town. Then the subordinate brothers received 3 guilder in Danish money except holy Brother Mathias who was a priest. He moved to Svendborg Friary and there served God a short time. Later he travelled from there left the order and ended his life in the Baltic where he drowned. On Trinity Sunday3 when the brethren in the choir had begun to sing the Kyrie eleison the aforementioned priest, Svend came back and invaded the friary together with a crowd of citizens to drive the brothers out immediately. He had with him a royal warrant wherein it was written that the citizens should assist the aforementioned Mogens Gj√∏'s priest to force the brothers out. But the brethren refused to travel away before they ate, so the citizens remained with the brothers while they ate, and after dinner, they chased the brothers out of the friary4. 1 Palm Sunday is the Sunday before Easter, which means that date varies from mid-March to early April. 2 Guilden (singular) or guilder (plural) was the common name for large silver coins in use at the time. One and a half guilder equalled a thaler or daler, two and a half guilder was equal to a riksthaler. Dalers were the common currency in Denmark until the 19th century when the krone was introduced. 3 The Guardian or Father Guardian was the leader of the local friary assisted by one or more Vice- Guardians. Other named positions in the chronicle include, cook, porter, and cellar master. 3 Trinity Sunday is the Sunday after Pentecost. Since it is dated from Easter, the date varies from late May to early June. The Sundays between Trinity Sunday and Advent in November are numbered from Trinity Sunday. e.g. Third Sunday after Trinity 4 The Danish word 'kloster' is used for all monastic religious houses, equivalent to 'convent' in English which furthermore makes a distinction between friary, priory, abbey, nunnery. Since information about many religious houses in Denmark before the Reformation is lacking, the word in the Chronicle is translated as friary. The only exception listed in the Chronicle is Antvorskov Abbey. 5 Royal warrants for expulsion were often the deciding factor which forced the closure of the friaries. Frederik I publicly tried an even-handed approach suggesting that Catholic and Lutherans share churches, which brought condemnation from both parties. Either on his own or by persuasion from local authorities, he wrote letters authorizing the expulsion of Franciscans from their friaries. He usually offered money to the monks which on his part was an inducement to leave peacefully either to travel or to abandon the monastic life. On the Franciscans' part, the offer of money was viewed as a cynical attempt to subvert their vows of poverty, to accept the king's money for personal use or gain was outside the 'rule' and a betrayal of their basic vows. Frederiks I's royal warrants specifically targeted Franciscan houses, no other order was so treated, even by Christian III who was thoroughly Lutheran and very anti- Catholic. On the whole, once it was clear the Lutherans would prevail, Danes took a level-headed approach to terminating monasteries. In 1536 when Denmark became officially Lutheran, the monasteries, all of them, were dissolved. The monks were turned out and either travelled to Germany or other monastic houses or simply took off their habits and became ordinary Danes. Nuns were often permitted to remain in their nunneries until their deaths and provision was made for them by local noble houses. In a few instances remote religious houses stayed open for a year or two, but in the end not a single monastic house survived until they were re-established in recent times. Chapter 2 Concerning the Friary at Viborg But in the year 1527 there came a certain lapsed (one) of the Order of St John's1 Abbey at Antvorskov, Master Hans Tausen2, who until that time had borne his monk's habit3 or (in other words) his clothing of virtue and began in his priory's church to preach the Lutheran heresy. And that day when he finished preaching, he removed his habit in the church which he had upon the pulpit and left there together with the citizens who had heard his preaching. They went to St. John's Church in the same town and there he gathered the people often who would hear his infectious Lutheran heresy and pour out his poisoned tongue's oaths. And then day after day (he preached) his disease-infested lessons, dripping with error great and small; he encouraged the citizens that our brethren should be expelled from there (the priory) during his Luther lessons, and that they should establish a school. St Johns' Church was not large enough for the numbers (of citizens) who wanted to hear the new and unheard of teaching. They asked if the church at our friary could be opened for his sect's preaching in the afternoon. But since that couldn't be permitted, the citizens in that town sent a letter to his royal highness in which they asked for permission to tear down the parish churches in that town because there were too many of them, namely 12 (in number). They also asked his royal highness if they might obtain the Blackfriars (Dominican) and Greyfriars (Franciscan) churches, so that instead of the many churches in the town they could meet together to hold the new lesson services there, and so tear down the other churches. When they received permission to (do this), they seized our friary church. But even before that the brethren were used to preaching before noon and the heretics in the afternoon by which they put many difficulties and obstacles in the brothers' way. First and foremost because they pushed (their way) through an open door into the friary and brought their preacher into our church. And on the Feast of All Saints4 their preacher spoke twice in the afternoon and allowed six of their psalms to be sung by those present. Whereby they prohibited us from holding vespers and vigils for the dead which the brethren were used to sing. But later they also took the church from the brethren, so that they might conduct their songs of praise and masses in the chapel at the cloister nearly the whole year through. But when the aforementioned citizens saw that the brethren refused to leave their friary, they stationed four soldiers in our friary and commanded the brethren under direction of the royal warrant to pay the cost of upkeep for the soldiers. But the Guardian Niels Tybo, had in the meantime decided to travel to Salling to gather alms. When he had begun his journey and was a mile from the town, there came a message from the brother's own servant to him telling him the sad news and asked him to return immediately. When he returned, and found out what had happened in the friary, he was resigned (to the fact) that the soldiers had come into the friary, but he was sadder to have to gather provisions for them. But one soldier came in before midday and attacked the Guardian, grabbed hold of his collar and struck him with his sword and later attacked the Guardian twice, once with a tankard of beer, the second time with his sword. The brethren in the meantime remained in the friary together with the aforementioned soldiers despite (the fact) that they endured much (that was) not right and many difficulties. One time it happened that two of the soldiers wanted to visit their comrades in Hostenborg. They demanded therefore of the Guardian the friary's wagon. But he determined that it could truly not be allowed because the wagon was used to carry grain to the mill. He rented therefore another wagon in place (of the first) then the Guardian paid for it with the friary's alms money. And furthermore, when he (the soldier) returned, he began to require of the Guardian just as much money as the wagon had cost otherwise he would let it be known that he had stayed home. Despite this the Guardian would not of his own free will give him (the money), he was at last forced to give him what he wanted. By the end the number of the soldiers grew to 15, and they used up our alms so that there was nothing remaining neither wet nor dry (goods). The Guardian decided to turn the keys of the friary over to another and travel to the king to complain about the wrongs against him and the brethren, but a town master5, who he had asked to take the keys, counselled him against the journey because it would be dangerous for himself and for the friary brothers if he fled and did not take care of his majesty's servants (the soldiers). The Guardian remained at the friary with the brethren and pawned a chalice to procure their food. But at last the Guardian travelled to Copenhagen to the king and received from him a sealed letter. When it was opened in Viborg and read out in the presence of the citizens, the monks were chased out, but with what right or authority only the Almighty can see and judge. This was all told to me, Brother Jacob (Jensen), by the worthy Father Niels Tybo, at the time the Guardian of the aforementioned Viborg Friary, now Vice-Guardian in Ribe. 1 Order of St John Hospitallers was one of the fighting orders that came about as a result of the Crusades. The Hospitallers were especially important to pilgrims and the sick. The Hospitallers operated hospitals, poor houses, and their priories offered space to religious travellers. The priories were supposed to produce a surplus that could be sent to the mother house on the Island of Rhodes to fund similar facilities to pilgrims to the Holy Land. The Hospitallers had several names, including Templars. 2 The habit of the Greyfriars consisted of the grey woollen ankle-length gown. A simple cord served as a belt. In inclement weather they might add a matching cowl. 3 Hans Tausen was perhaps the most influential individual in the Danish Reformation. He was a monk of the order of St John's Hospitallers and went to study in Augsburg with Martin Luther and came back persuaded that the church needed reform. He preached a Lutheran sermon at Antvorskov Abbey on Good Friday 1525 creating an instant controversy. He was shuttled off to St John's Priory in Viborg to give him time to come to his senses. Instead Viborg became the earliest centre for the Reformation in Denmark as a result of Tausen's fearless preaching. He was named Frederik I's own chaplain to give him some measure of protection. After the Count's Feud and Denmark's becoming officially Lutheran in October 1536, Tausen lost much of his influence and was later Bishop of Ribe for twenty years until his death. 4 Feast of All Saints was 1 November the day after All Hallows Eve. 5 Danish towns were presided over by the town masters (Danish:borgmestre), a group of wealthy merchants or others who were responsible to carry out local laws. The council, composed of other influential town leaders, served in an advisory capacity to the masters of the town. In the Chronicle individual town masters influenced events of the expulsions, and once the town master decided the monks had to go, it didn't take very long before the friary was dissolved, often with the complicity of the king or his officials. Chapter 3 Concerning the Friary in T√∏nder In 1530 after our Lord Jesus Christ's appearance in the flesh, eight days after the Virgin Mary's Nativity1, when King Frederik, brother to King Hans, who at that time was once King in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway came to T√∏nder to his castle there. A Lutheran lesson was preached in our friary's holy church, the Church of the Holy Virgin Mary. And after having heard the lesson, the king was walking in the choir, and Niels Tybo who at one time was Guardian of the place went toward his royal highness and asked him as humbly as he could if the brethren might receive permission as before to remain there and serve God. The king turned himself away from him and said that he would announce his decision before he travelled on. A few of the brothers remained a few days at the friary and waited upon the announcement of the king. Because before the king came, the bailiff of the castle had taken over the friary except the choir, dormitory, and a little room to eat in and brought the castle's provisions there1. When the king stood ready to travel, the Father Guardian went again to the king and asked as humbly as possible if they could remain there and in the usual way serve the Lord God. The king answered that he could not permit it any longer because the lord of the castle wouldn't have enough room to store his things if they were to remain there as well, and the friary walls lay too close to the castle, so it would be torn down. The Father Guardian replied that the brethren would under no conditions trouble the bailiff of the caste or prevent him in anything, if they (could) just stay there and serve God. The king answered that there would be space to accomplish that in another place. When the king had ridden away, the bailiff of the castle took control of everything that had belonged to the friary and chased the monks away. They only retained their clothing and two pairs of horses which he gave to them to carry away the old and weak. 1 The Nativity of the Virgin Mary was celebrated on 8 September. 2 The arrangement of Franciscan friaries was laid out in a similar pattern. The buildings arranged in a rough rectangle included a church, upstairs dormitory, refectory, quarters for servants or lay people, cemeteries, and cellars. Two mention hospitals or places for the sick. Chapter houses or rooms seem conspicuously absent. Chapter 4 Concerning the Friary in Malm√∏ This is the account about the inhuman way the expulsion of the Greyfriars from their friary in Malm√∏ took place. In 1527 after the Saviour of the world's incarnation, there came to Malm√∏ a certain priest who was shameless and filled with the heretic's usual errors, Claus B√∏dker he was called, the barrel maker. He went about spewing forth the most overwhelming evil. He had been ordained a priest in the Diocese of Lund, but since he had insufficient knowledge of the scriptures either secular or spiritual, he went to Copenhagen, where the study of theology bloomed, but where it (the study) was more eager about Lutheran than the Catholic theology. There he learned the errors, though secretly, because the teaching of Lutheran falsehoods had not yet been sowed in public. And so this priest, Claus B√∏dker, filled with unclean falsehoods, also infected others with them. He went several times up into the pulpit in the greatest churches, specifically the church of the highly praised Virgin Mary and preached with enormous pride, for he had a beautiful and resounding voice. But when the Bishop of Roskilde, a man of great and earnest Catholic faith, discovered that now and again (B√∏dker) spoke disparagingly about the people of the church and spread abroad the errors of the Lutheran party's falsehoods, he forbade him (B√∏dker) from preaching from any pulpit in the Diocese (of Roskilde). Afterwards it so happened that Jorgen M√∏ntmester in Malm√∏ heard a rumour about it. He was himself, though secretly, full of the Lutheran teaching's errors. He got the priest to come himself to Malm√∏ and told him his secret desire. He (M√∏ntmester) promised him (B√∏dker) that he should carry out his desire on the most faithful, specifically to poison Malm√∏ with the Lutheran heresy to hatred against all of them (brothers in the monastery). He demanded then a place where he could preach in the town, but the town master, J√∏rgen M√∏ntmester, could not yet permit it, the Lutheran heresy was namely not yet so strong or well known in Denmark, as we now see it. But (Claus B√∏dker) received permission to preach outside the town in a green meadow in which there lay an old chapel. Thereto nearly the whole population of the town went to hear the new and unfamiliar preaching. And he preached to them powerfully and mixed in but little or none of his heretical errors. This turncoat of a man understood himself well enough this evil counsel that one cannot in the beginning blurt out the pure poison, but little by little get his hearer's ears used to it with sweet honey. But when they heard the preaching out in the field, they praised his efforts and talent to preach God's word. They thought it an injustice that such a wonder should not be allowed within the walls as if he was suspect. When there came a complaint that the grass around the chapel was (being) trampled down, they moved their wonder into the town, first to the Chapel of the Holy Spirit. There he remained for a long time (creating) in between small irritations of his heresy and received protectors and defenders of his preaching. But at last there came so many to hear his lessons that the chapel could not hold the crowds of people. Furthermore, he began at that time to spread his teaching's insane poison more openly after he had gathered to himself more courage because of the support of so many. His followers and protectors number and daring (grew) day by day. He lit with his lessons the celebration by many (though without understanding Romans 10:2). He went then to the holy church of St. Peter and asked the priest there, whose name was Henrik, if the door of the church could be opened for them, for instance after noon, so that holy and pure word of God could be heard there, though the priest would retain his rights and his authority over the church. There assembled then daily a great gathering from the town as if it was the most cheerful play and there this heretic spoke most shamelessly against all the church's true doctrines. Though he had had almost a year ago been driven out by the Archbishop of Lund's (Aage Sparre's) order, but he had taken up with a lapsed (monk) of the Order of the Holy Ghost, one Johannes Urnarius, also called Hans Spandemager. Those two went to Haderslev and were filled with Danish hymns and the Lutheran heresy's poison, next they came to Malm√∏, encouraged by the king's letter of immunity and went up and down (the region) undermining the altars, sent priests fleeing, and destroyed chapels near St Peter the Apostle's Church. There the heretic priest, Claus set up a profane altar, namely a table lifted far above the ground where he occasionally celebrated his communion. It was in the end destroyed, and the profane altar which still stands there today was set up, but the pictures and the altar pictures were thrown out, cut to pieces, destroyed and burned and then the parish priest was given a compensation amount and was installed as pastor for the whole town's religious life. Now we follow the plan further whereby he drove the brethren out of the friary. In the first year of his preaching the heretic, Claus, began small, though groundless, attacks on the brethren with his poisonous tongue like a spear, When the brethren held a burial for one or another he paid particular attention to their words and after the burial lesson came to quarrel with them about his heresy. It so happened that one time when Brother Jacob, the Vice-Guardian with moderation had preached God's word, that this heretic followed him to the friary's gate. When they had both arrived there, the heretic, Claus, asked Brother Jacob what it meant to do penance. At first Brother Jacob kept his mouth closed, sure that to answer such a crazy man was pointless, and in the end he replied with these words of St Paul, \\"for as ye have yielded your limbs servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your limbs servants to righteousness unto holiness.\\" What is that? asked Brother Jacob. \\"Listen,\\" he said to all those who stood about, \\"if this heretic, Claus, spends three days with a scourge, and prays, so he ought in his own words to do penance by fasting three days upon bread and water.\\" That did not sound good in his (Claus') ears because he wanted go to other places with his preaching. The heretic stood there blushing through and through without knowing which way to turn to escape from the conversation. In the meantime Brother Gabriel, the Guardian, heard this from inside and walked out and asked why Brother Jacob permitted himself to join with such ignorant and insane heretics. So the attacks and the reproaches directed towards the aforementioned heretic and his followers and especially against the aforementioned Brother Jacob during the time of the plague (even) in the cemetery. They called him now and again a deceiver, at other times a blind man and a stubborn man, but he taught always openly the truth, thanks be to God's merciful help. And then upon a time Brother Jacob who was gathered with others in the church in the aforesaid town, namely in St George's Chapel, at the day of consecration for that holy place after he had preached courageously the truth about faith and works, after the lesson and he was about to go out of the door of the church, another heretic broke in, it was Urnarius, the same Hans Spandemager, lapsed from the Order of the Holy Spirit who had gathered a great crowd of people in the area to the south and then proceeded to the friary. He broke in and demanded that he (the Guardian), if there was any courage in him, should debate with him about the scriptures. Brother Jacob answered that he would be glad to debate before his lord the Archbishop and others who were experienced with scripture. But when the other and his followers pushed harder upon him, Brother Jacob stopped his walk a moment and wanted to hear his question. So he (Claus) asked him (Brother Jacob), \\"What is a good work? Give me an example!\\" Brother Jacob replied in this manner, \\"To fast for a good causes is a good work.\\" But it did not please the heretic to hear that, because he (Brother Jacob) proved it satisfactorily from Matthew chapter six. So the heretic and his followers drew themselves back. In the daytime they were always present at the lessons of the brethren which they paid attention to so they could trap them in their words. But when they could not find grounds to silence the brethren in their lessons, they compiled at length a few imagined and misunderstood accusations with which they damaged the reputation of the brethren or whipped up the people against them. Furthermore, there were some who instigated an utter and furious riot in the church against the aforementioned Brother Jacob, the Vice-Guardian and one time against Brother Gabriel, the Guardian. On one occasion just after noon when that heretic, Claus B√∏dker, the town's persecutor noticed especially that Brother Jacob and Brother Kristoffer Mathiesen were away, he went into our friary church and there he began to preach, where he barked like a dog against the brothers most shamelessly with his impure nonsense. But then Brother Kristoffer came from the bath just as the heretic finished his lesson. He went immediately up onto the pulpit and explained from holy writ that the brethren were not guilty of that which he had accused them. But when he went down, the heretic stood up once again and thereafter (by) Brother Kristoffer. So it continued the whole day until vespers4 just at five o'clock, they took turns preaching; Brother Kristoffer three times and the heretic twice. Shortly before this tumultuous time namely in 1529 after the Saviour of the world's incarnation near the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary2 there came a preacher to the town especially learned in the heretics wrong teaching, Brother Frans Lector or Luther-Frans he was called. He had been of the Carmelite order and had been recently driven out of his teaching position in Copenhagen by the shouting and crying of the canons. He assured with sneaky underhandedness that he would preach God's word pure and clean and that he would remove the disunity among the citizens that had arisen because of the preacher's differences (of opinion), but he would not go up into the pulpit until he had received a preaching licence from the archbishop. He also travelled to Lund to obtain a preaching licence from Archbishop Aage, and he was received in an especially friendly fashion, as one who would be the truth's preacher in Malm√∏; who would set all falsehoods back onto the correct path. And so the superintendent of the honourable Lund church Master Aage Jepsen gave this Frans four or six guilder to cover his expenses. The mentioned Luther-Frans, the false apostle, promised him also as uprightly as possible to preach God's word. \\"Your shoemaker (and)your barrel maker, and scripture shapers are they not filled to the brim with all possible trickery for disputation in which you have (involved) yourselves. I wonder if you have won over the whole of the papal clergy? I call you a weak herd of cattle!\\" said Brother Jacob. But the citizens of Malm√∏ who feared the destruction of the city because of their brothers' secret masses chased at last the brethren away from the choir. Though J√∏rgen M√∏ntmester told the brothers to hold services in another place namely in the vestry, though with the condition that they themselves at God's judgement should stand to answer for these 'ungodly masses' as he called them. O what a sunshine clear answer from the city's wise leader. He didn't figure that that type of person's adultery meant much, but to prevent the service of God after the holy Catholic Church's usage is so criminal that one shudders for day of judgement. O how they strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. Such a great abhorrence for the celebration of the mass was there among the citizens of Malm√∏ that they drove Brother Johannes Plov away from the altar with the casting of stones and shouting when he was celebrating the mass. There was also at one time a pile of stones found under the pulpit; gathered together to be used as ammunition. Then their hate grew daily and their minds were filled with mischief, which was their soul's sickness, that focused all their energy upon the ways they could discover to get the brethren to leave the friary, our home. They were careful not to break any natural or religious law to accomplish their goals. In the meantime there came the masters of the city and the councilmen with deceitful promises and temptations to soften the brother's minds and at the same time frighten them with threats so that they (might flee) to another place away from our friary. As soon as they got a foot inside, swiftly the whole mob would follow. In addition to that, the brothers also kept constant watch and closed (the gates) so that they under no condition would permit them that, but repeatedly referred to those who had given them the place. But at no point did the brethren do what was ordered, when they (the mob) took (control of) the servants quarters, or when they on their own authority with violence took the orchard, and thereafter built a hospital for the poor as if it was a righteous act, in the orchard after they had destroyed another poor priory. They left open both sides of the orchard gate and people and animals streamed inside both day and night ignoring the brethren. No peace was given to the brothers or the right to celebrate services or to read from the canons or to renew their bodies. Through all of these evil times the brethren remained unshakable, continued the reading of the holy scriptures at the set times and preached God's word. From the brothers' fast for Christmas to just before Lent they held every vesper. But at Carnival3 a few of the heretics assembled themselves near the gate to our friary to listen to the scriptures in their fashion and to prevent anyone from coming to hear the brethren and the scriptures. But the services each evening when ordinary people slept they held in the usual manner. And at the Feast of Easter, precisely second Easter day's evening when the brethren at Matins sang the 3rd Psalm, they (the heretics) threw seven fairly large stones through the north window and nearly all the brethren fled from the choir. After Ester they often invaded our friary and sought with threats and sometimes promises to belabor them so that they should follow their perverse will desire namely that either they join themselves to their heresy or turn the friary over to them for a theological school with the explanation that they themselves when the sacred hours and services ceased, they should pay for the school, in short, that they would be able to empower themselves so that the learned doctors in the 'true theology', or I mean God and the saint's mockers. Next when the brethren neither would not go along with that, they sent some inside who should hinder them in reading the holy writ in our friary. Therefore, the brothers quieted their voices when reading the scriptures aloud. They in this way lessened the evil against them but they continued, though, with the readings at the usual times. Though they (the citizens) often sent people to keep an eye on them so that they would not in another way be able to read the holy lessons or preach in our friary. But one day after noon they came in to the brethren who were gathered in the refectory and asked them if they would convert to Luther's teaching and hear instruction and preaching. They asked each brother one at a time. But all the brethren answered no and assured them that they would under no conditions convert to the other teaching that they had heard and that their teaching and readers of the holy scriptures taught them well enough about what they heard to understand the holy writ. When Master J√∏rgen M√∏ntmester praised his learned master's reading and preaching, Brother Gabriel, the Guardian, who took offense over the fox-crafty man's words that their preachers and reading masters lived in adultery. \\"What are you saying said M√∏ntmester. \\"Is the honourable estate (marriage) adultery? The Guardian answered excusing himself that he had not called the honourable estate adultery, but the M√∏ntmester faulted him for (saying) the opposite. But then the Vice-Guardian Jacob pointed a knife at them. \\"Father Guardian, have you said that their honourable marriages are a life in adultery? Then you have spoken correctly and it cannot be denied. We can easily prove it is as you have said.\\" By these words were Frans, the apostates, and heretics struck and seized in such a degree of rage that he could not control his lips or his mouth. He answered in his rage that all our vows were not virtuous. Brother Jacob answered him among other things that an apostate's word about vows had no validity. So they drew themselves back with many words both outside and inside. In the fourth week after Easter, (8‚Äì14 May 1529) many citizens one day, driven to rage by their violent hate, at the 8th hour (2 o'clock) came to the friary while the Guardian was holding services in the vestry. Vice-guardian Brother Jacob commanded the cellar master Brother Jacob Jensen to bar all the doors with strong timbers, but he was unable to do it. They came inside by the door from the servant's quarters and the Guardian went out to them, while the brethren remained in the dormitory, because he hoped he could soothe their wild minds with calm words. But when he came to them in the refectory, they scolded him and insulted him with such gross shouting that he went up to the dormitory to call the brethren together. But when he would not permit the upper ranks to go down to them together with their Vice-Guardian he said that those who would, could remain in the cellar. To that the brothers answered, \\"If he himself would not leave the friary with them, we none of us will leave.\\" All the brothers went down to them (the citizens) in the refectory where they had assembled with grim demeanor and cruel minds. When the brothers had gathered, the citizens expressed the desire that they (the brothers) immediately abandon the friary or convert to their faith. When the brothers ignored both (suggestions) they remained with them until noon sometimes speaking with the brothers, and sometimes they threatened but a royal warrant or permission they could not show, and the brethren said no steadily to abandoning the friary. So they took the keys to the beer cellar and refectory from the cellar master and the cook and brought up much provision and drink. After dinner they sang a long psalm to mock the brethren. When that was completed and the brothers steadily refused to leave, all the city fathers except Jens Fynbo left. He alone remained together with the many do-nothings to drive out the brethren and began in many ways to force the keys of the friary from the Guardian. When he said no and evening had fallen they said that the brothers could not leave the refectory unless they did what was wanted. The brothers remained all night in the refectory and lay upon the floor. There was an elderly brother, Laurids Jakobsen, who was brought near to death by the plagues. He obtained permission to go up to the dormitory on the condition that he would ponder until the next day his conversion to their faith. When they had locked the brothers inside the refectory, those who had been set to watch brought up beer from the cellar and drank themselves drunk the whole night, sang and danced in the dormitory and choir, rang the bell constantly and held a real Bacchus orgy and every hour through the night they opened the door to the refectory and went inside to see if the monks had fled out of the windows. In the morning, they (the brothers) could hardly get permission to go to the toilet and when someone went out there, two or three or four followed them to keep an eye on them all the way out to the toilet door. When they came back, they locked the door until the city masters came. When they came sometime before noon, they introduced their teacher to the brothers in the refectory, so that they could convert, actually persecute them into the Lutheran faith. But when they ended two lessons about dinner time and could not convince the brethren of their heresy, they drove them by force out of the friary, every one of the brothers received his bedclothes and a washbasin that was retrieved from the cells. When they were about to leave through the cemetery, they took the Guardian Gabriel Poulsen and Brother Bernhard Poulsen, the other Vice-Guardian away from the brothers and led them to prison because they would not tell where the founding letters4 were, they (the Guardians) had sent them in advance to another place for safe-keeping. The other monks went to Lund, but the two were released from prison on the condition that they attend their heretic lessons. It happened that the Guardian went along with that and now is led astray and after a year has removed his habit. The Almighty and All-Powerful God have compassion over him because of his boundless kindness. To God be the honour and a glory for this and the blessing rich works he has done toward us and toward all his creations from the beginning of creation until the hour when he will gather them again and for all things and for every single thing given us and gives them back again in eternity. Amen. 1 Carnival (Danish:fastelavn) was celebrated the week before Lent begins usually in February. 2 Feast of the Purification of the Virgin Mary was a set feast day in the old church calendar on 2 February. It commemorated when Mary went to the temple after Jesus' birth. Today it is often called the Feast of the Presentation. 3 The canonical day at the time was called the Divine Office which were prayers and worship services at set times during the day. Matins was the earliest service at dawn. Lauds came next. Services during the day were named after the hours. Vespers was the service in early evening. Compline was just before bedtime. 4 The founding letters were essentially the deed to the religious house. The letters were notices of gift from a wealthy land owner to a religious order. Possession of the founding letters seemed to be an important step in turning out the friars on several occasions. Chapter 5 Concerning the Friary in Copenhagen The expulsion of the monks from (Copenhagen) Friary occurred the same year as the friars of Malm√∏ were driven out (1529)1. The description of that, the inhuman methods and proceedings which were used in the persecution and the mournful expulsion is recounted on the following pages. (The rest of the description is missing or blank.) 1 The date is established by the previous entry for the Expulsion from Malm√∏ in mid-May 1529. Chapter 6 Concerning the Friary in Kolding In 1529 from the Saviour of the world's incarnation, about the time of the Feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary1, while our order suffered persecution under King Frederik, the son of the most Christian King Christian II's son, came the aforementioned king, the opponent of all Christian religion and corrupted by the Lutheran heresy to Kolding. At the urging of some few Lutheran citizens and the nobleman, Hartvig Andersen Ulfeld, who desired our friary, was there sent a few noblemen from the aforesaid king to those of our brethren who lived there, to tell them that they must abandon the friary and move to another place because the king would not permit them to remain, and he sent them some money, exactly 100 marks, as travel money. When the brothers under no circumstance would accept the money, it was deposited at the friary hospital where it remained untouched until the next day. Now the king realized that they would not comply with his wishes or even receive his gifts, so he sent people there who should drive them out of the friary by force and by the king's command. The aforementioned king offered the monks a chalice, equipment, and the attire required for celebrating the Mass. But out of love for Jesus Christ they spurned the offer. They departed and for their Christian faith's sake were robbed of the alms collections and everything else that was in the friary, and they knew not where they should go. Meanwhile, all the brethren who had been driven out were received in other locations, except a brother by the name of Martin, who laid aside his habit and remained inside the friary. Monks before the expulsion had suffered much evil because of the heretics in Kolding and their preacher, a lapsed Dominican friar, who had been expelled from Haderslev Priory. 1 The Feast of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary was celebrated on 8 September. Chapter 7 Concerning the Friary in √Ölborg In 1530 there was a shameless heretic by the name of Axel Gj√∏, the bailiff of √Ölborg Castle and son of Herr Mogens Gj√∏, the author of all this evil, like father, like son, who plagued the brothers in the √Ölborg Friary in many ways. First, he asked our Father Guardian, Brother Johannes Kristensen, if he could obtain warehouse space, so that he could deliver some grain to the friary's loft. But thereafter he began little by little to take more space and by force removed the brother's provisions. Now when the brethren had brewed a great amount of beer and went to services in the church, he (Gj√∏) brought his servants and took all the new-brewed beer down into his (part of the) cellar. By doing this over and over again, he brought the brothers into such want that they scarcely had a corner in the friary where they could be left in peace. Every day he plagued them more and more. At last he even removed the clapper from the bell, so that they could not ring it or call the people together, and he processed around the churchyard with his servants who carried a flag. Soon thereafter persecuting and mocking the brethren in intolerable ways, he chased them out of the friary by force. Chapter 8 Concerning the Friary at Randers In the year of the Lord 1530 after the brethren had countless quarrels and suffered much from the heretics side, Mogens Gj√∏1, who at that time was the heretic's protector and himself the worst heretic, received three letters from King Frederik I concerning the Grayfriar's expulsion from the friary in Randers. So he (Gj√∏) sent his bailiff to Randers. He (the bailiff) came into our friary along with the master of the town and the town bailiff and showed the royal warrants, the result of which was that in compensation for the Friary at Flensborg, and as a reward for his long service, he (Gj√∏) had persuaded his majesty who gave him the Grayfriars Friary in Randers. The Guardian, Jens Jostens, replied in the meantime that he absolutely would not forsake his friary because of the letter. They said to him, \\"Have you no greater respect for his majesty?\\" \\"I will show him all dutiful honour,\\" he said. So they said to him, \\"So ask for a temporary postponement!\\" Which he did. They granted him immediately a postponement until the next Sunday, and then they drove the monks out. There was a traitor, Brother Henning, who heard the Guardian say to the porter in the cloister that he should not open the gate when the town bailiff and the others came to force the brothers out. Henning went to the town bailiff, and told him the Guardian would not speak to him at the gate, but near the iron grill in the church. When the town bailiff came and knocked on the gate, the porter, Brother Clemens, let him go to the grillwork and went himself to fetch the Guardian. In time Brother Clemens opened the grillwork for them. The citizens came into the friary met the Guardian and porter in the cloister and demanded the Guardian again to obey the king's letter. \\"We will not under any circumstances abandon the friary because of the letter.\\" The bailiff grew angry and threatened him and declared him a rebel against his majesty. But when the bailiff and the others went to return through the grille, the porter already having opened the gate, then came the traitor, Brother Henning and said, \\"No, you should not go out that way. If you go out that way, it will be a year before you will get back into the friary.\\" The bailiff followed his counsel, went back to the Guardian and said to him, \\"I will remain here with you today and set my kettle on the fire with your kettle.\\" He remained with the others and chased thereafter all the brothers from the friary and permitted Mogens Gj√∏ to take over the friary. 1 Mogens Axelsen Gj√∏ was the master of the court (Danish:rigshofmesteren) under Frederik I. In this capacity he became the chief enforcer of Frederik's policy of limiting the power of religious houses, specifically Franciscans. He received the Randers Friary as a reward for his fervor. He is specifically mentioned in the Jutland expulsions as the prime mover. Apparently his father was a fervent Lutheran as mentioned in the expulsion at Aalborg. Chapter 9 Concerning the Friary in Trelleborg (The Page is Missing.) 1 Trelleborg is extreme southern Sk√•ne. While the chronicle page describing the expulsion of the friars in Trelleborg is missing, it is known from other documents that the friars left Trelleborg on their own without being forced out. While this may on the surface appear a happier circumstance than other locations, something must have occurred that sent the friars packing. Perhaps the 'quarrels' mentioned in √Ölborg between monks and reform-minded Trelleborgers was enough to convince the Franciscans it was time to go before they were forcibly removed. The friary was completely dependent on the surrounding community for food and necessitites. Trelleborg is a small town and if the majority of citizens refused to supply them, the brothers would have to leave or starve. Chapter 10 Concerning the Friary in K√∏ge In 1530 after many regrettable events, whereof the most frequent happened during Brother Laurens Hansen's time, who had been the vicar and minister, (the citizens) asked the monks, who were heavily burdened by the heretics and suffered from want of provisions, about postponing their expulsion. Preacher Hans Brun was present. The citizens (agreed to) help them on condition that when the agreed upon respite expired, they should leave their friary, unless they could obtain more sustenance, and turn the place over to the citizens. This they agreed to, in spite of the minister's demand that the should be no such a respite for them. So by introducing such trickery and deception of the Guardian and brothers, that they were compelled to abandon the friary. Chapter 11 Concerning the Friary in Halmstad Herein is explained the method whereby the friary in Halmstad was invaded and the brothers expelled in the following words: 13 January 1531 the priest and heretic Hans Hemmingsdyng came from Falsterbo1 to Halmstad, he was a perverse Lutheran, and he was called to the town by the citizens the preach the word. If only it had been the word of God! A few days after his arrival in Halmstad town he gathered a great crowd of citizens together with the town masters, he went after noon into the brother's church and while the assembled accomplices listened, he scolded the brothers for three things: that the brothers were spiritual thieves, soul murderers, and deceivers against the common people, and they continued that one could not prove the Grayfriars rule from the holy scriptures. Brother Mads Madsen, who at the time was the Guardian answered him for all the brethren and a great crowd of the congregation's hearing: > \\"St Paul commanded in 2 Timothy 2:14, where he says 'Strive not about words > to no profit, which only subverts the hearers.' Therefore, your charges > according to every court pro is void, I mean that your are the prosecutor > with a false accusation, you over reach yourself and it is not right that > you be both witness and judge. Therefore I reject you as one who renders > only spite and are not our judge, and I will appeal the case against you > before the archbishop and the chapter in Lund, where I can cleanse myself > and mine before learned men against this false charge which you have brought > against us and witness as clear as the sun that our rule is apostolic and > truly evangelical.\\" Later on Septuagesima Sunday2 in the first lesson that was held where Brother S√∏ren Jacobsen, who was later mortally wounded in Ystad during the persecution of the brethren, said in his lesson toward the conclusion that the three vows (poverty, chastity, and obedience) and the commandments of the rule (of St Francis of Assisi), its (detailed) contents and essence were clearly taken from the gospel of Christ. The aforementioned heretic, Hans Hemmingsdyng, was present to catch the preacher during his lesson as the scripture-wise and Pharisee were want to attack Jesus. When he heard that, he became angry and incited the citizens against the brothers, first inside the friary church once the lesson was completed and thereafter in the parish church where he swore that he (Brother S√∏ren) will never preach to them (the brothers and congregation) again, if (he did) they would attack the brothers and prevent them from preaching and holding mass. But when the brothers immediately held services, they (the citizens) promised after receiving advice from several clever citizens counsel that they would wait until after noon. After noon of the aforementioned Septuagesima Sunday the masters of the town, town councillors, and town bailiff and many other citizens of the Lutheran sect took first the chalice from the brothers, next they plundered the altars and removed the book of the mass and other books from the book cabinet into the sacristy. The town bailiff received the keys to the sacristy and locked everything in there. It was also forbidden to the brothers after that time to ring the bells at the appointed times. All these things the citizens instituted by the authority they took to themselves without orders from a higher authority, (and that) after just hearing from the devilish priest Hans Hemmingsdybg. The brethren received, however, permission to remain in the friary until they had procured foot gear, but not all of them left the friary when the time elapsed. In order to bring to pass what the Lutherans desired, the nobleman Holger Gerson, the mayor and the counselors went into the friary and obtained from them a promise that six of the brothers might remain in the friary, though with the conditions that they might not hold mass, not preach God's word, not go out begging, or go out to the surrounding farm towns without the mayor's permission, or otherwise encourage anyone in the old praiseworthy rituals against the Lutheran sect, or even hear the scriptures. But because one of the six mentioned brothers, specifically the above named Brother, S√∏ren Jacobsen on the first Sunday in Lent listened to two person's confession, he was expelled along with the others. But the rest of the brothers in the friary were expelled or left on their own in the Lord's year 1531, the week of Laetare3. In Roskilde there is to be found a letter of recommendation concerning the brothers behavior and the seal of the friary. There were goods which were sold or taken from the aforementioned Halstad Friary, but were promised to be returned over time etc. This concerns the following: First Master Gerhard Olsen, mayor of the town of Halstad in 1530 shortly before Christmas took by force a gilded chalice which his father, Oluf Petersen gave the convent; it was never recorded in the royal register4 because his mother, who lived at the time, continually encouraged him to leave it for ecclesiastical use for which it was given. Later the same Gerhard Olsen received a farm which lay next to the churchyard south of the friary that Brother Laurentius Byldtzman, when he was Guardian, allowed to be purchased for 160 marks. That farm Gerhard desired to have in exchange for a half farm which his sister a little earlier had willed to our friary in Halmstad. Later the Halmstad town bailiff, Niels Skriver, got by force a copper or brass kettle from Jon Styng's house, which was placed in pawn to him by the Guardian for 15 marks despite that it was in common business worth at least 20 marks. It was not included in the register because of an oversight by the scribe. And furthermore Hans Bagge, received a farm which lay next to the friary next to the water mill, which Nielse Erikssen who then lived in Halmstad, willed to the brothers the one half when he himself died, and the other half part after his wife's death, and they both died before the dissolution of the friary. And furthermore Herr Holger Grerson Ulfstand, before the retirement of the Guardian Mads Madsen, received four silver weapon (sheaths) for which the friary received no compensation. And he also loaned 1 short saw, and another saw which was located in the four-sided archway. And furthermore Herr Holger took under his protection, at Brother Mads Madsen's request, a chapel with attached house in Skan√∏r, which the friary had built there. And furthermore the same Herr Holger received of the friary 20 boards 36 feet long, 3 (tylvter) and two of wood, 28 feet, four boards 34 feet long, 5 boards of 32 feet, 10 boards of 40 feet. for all of this the brethren received four tuns of Rye, 6 tuns of barley, and five tuns of oats. Grain was particularly expensive in the land that year. Furthermore, the aforementioned Herr Holger gave 13 or 14 marks to the brethren who were chased out. Similarly. Hologer Gersen's wife got a faultless little clock which she promised to return if the friary was reestablished. Brother Siger received the large comforter on behalf of Herr Holger's persistent petition which the town bailiff permitted him to obtain until he should return it when it was required. Brother Siger also got (Brother) Vilhelms' little sermon book. Likewise Halmstad's Lutheran pastor by the name of Jasper, who at one time had been a brother of the order, but who had become the most perverse heretic, received the large concordance to the published Bible, which the town bailiff permitted him to take against the time when he should surrender it in time. The same Jasper received a coverlet with the permission of the town bailiff. So much for the friary in Halmstad. 1 Falsterbo is a town on the tiny westernmost peninsula of Sk√•ne lies opposite south Zealand. 2 Septuagesima Sunday is the third Sunday before Lent begins. It marks the beginning of the Pre-Lenten season of the old church calendar. 3 Laetare Sunday is the fourth Sunday in Lent, the half-way point until Easter. It usually falls in March. 4 The royal registry refers to a comprehensive inventory of religious houses commanded by King Frederik I. It included not only land and income properties but specific valuable items which had been donated over time to the various religious institutions in Denmark. The Franciscans viewed the registry as the 'thin edge of the wedge' that would eventually end in the dissolution of the monasteries. Chapter 12 Concerning the Friary in Ystad This is the story of the inhuman and sorrowful ways the Grayfriar monks were persecuted or hounded out of Ystad Friary by the Lutheran sect in the Lord's year 1532, shortly before the Annunciation of the birth of Jesus1 to the blessed Virgin Mary. The following events will make it clear for the reader to see how unrighteously and unChristian they were dealt with. First one must make it clear that already before the brother's expulsion the Lutheran citizens had used violence against them, despite that they (the brothers) had complained to the king and the State Council. The first violent episode took place when the Lutheran party driven and inflamed by a devilish and fire-spouting spirit came to the Ystad Friary, encircled it, and forced their way inside, and it would have succeeded if the brethren had not strengthened the gate and church door with heavy beams and pieces of wood and personally offered strong resistance. But the Lutherans began to smash the planks of the church door and tore down the enclosure surrounding the friary and invaded the servants quarters. But because of the brothers' resistance, they could not get into the interior of the friary. Therefore, they filled the brothers' ears with scolding and mocking; they called them murderers, robbers, thieves, blood suckers, and soul destroyers. The second violent episode against the brothers was by the same Lutherans who determined to enter the friary and write down all the friary contents without authority. At that time a certain S√∏ren Jepsen and another citizen named Ingvard destroyed the door and lock to the dormitory. These things and many unkind words were used against the Ystad brethren before their expulsion. Now follows a short account of the expulsion. The year after the above-named events, that is 1532, before the Feast of the Annunciation to the Blessed Virgin Mary1 just as we were finished with vespers and the official service, the town mayor, Hans Hjort, came together with his Lutheran party and a great part of the citizens and pounded violently on the gate and demanded to be admitted. That was denied them, and they ran to the church grillwork2 with burning rage and shouting. They shook the grillwork so that it was nearly broken it into pieces by force. When the Guardian, Brother Anders Bertelsen, heard it, he hurried together with some of the other brothers to the grille and asked them why they had come with such anger and such rage, and what they wanted. They all shouted that they had a royal letter (indicating) that all the brothers should be expelled and the friary remodeled into a hospital for the poor and the sick. They asked if they might come in, but when the Guardian would not permit them, they said they would force their way into the friary. When the Guardian heard that, he demanded to see the royal warrant that ordered such an expulsion, and if they could not show it, then they (the monks) would under no circumstances leave the friary. The citizens replied that they would under no circumstances show him the letter. After this exchange of words, Hans Hjort together with all the others went back to the gate and asked if he and a few other people could enter the friary and speak peacefully with him and the brothers without violence or wrong. And he promised on his faith under oath, yes under the loss of his position, that he would keep his word. And then under those assurances of his trustworthiness the guardian opened the gate. But when the door was opened, Hans Hjort with all his followers ran raging into the friary and tore the keys violently from the porter. When they had done that, Soren Jepsen demanded of the Guardian the founding charters of the friary, its keys, and the accounts concerning the properties which had been recorded in the royal register. register Guardian demanded two or three times that someone should read aloud the royal warrant. At last the town scribe, S√∏ren was his name, took out a wad of paper without a seal and read aloud to the Guardian and his brothers the articles and reasons for which they should be expelled: First, the brethren did not preach the holy Gospel. For the second, all the citizens desired that the brethren be expelled. For the third, the brethren had no way to sustain themselves. When this was read out and heard, the Guardian asked Master Niels Vinther and the town council if the brethren had preached anything other than Christ's holy Gospel and the holy scriptures. Whereupon they replied that the brethren had preached correctly and Catholic for them and had lived uprightly among them and said: We do not at all wish that the brethren should be chased away.\\" The Lutherans contradicted them, and there arose a great internal division among the citizens. When quiet was restored, the Guardian appealed to the king and State Council; he would reply to these false charges. And he said that those here (referring to the warrant) have spoken to the king in error. Thereafter S√∏ren Jespen ran forward in great haste toward the Guardian and tore the keys violently from him. When the brethren saw that, they ran away, all of them; some up into the choir, others into the dormitory, but the Lutheran citizens hunted them forcefully out of the cells, dragged them out and struck them with their axes. But one brother, called S√∏ren Jacobsen, they threw to the floor near the stair to the dormitory several times, stomped on him with their feet and in the cloister smashed him against the walls and dragged him around the cloister by his arms like a dumb ass. When he finally escaped from them, he said to his brethren: \\"I tell you, brothers, and it is true, that I feel my death is near after such blows and bumps as I have taken; I am so poorly that I can hardly draw a breath.\\" Several days afterwards this brother went to bed and began to be very ill, such that he spit up blood continually and often fell unconscious to the floor. When Brother S√∏ren lay in his final hours a few (citizens) came to him, councilor Algod Nielsen, Mogens Johansen, Tycho Laurentsen, Tue Sutor, and Peter Olsen came to (see) the aforementioned Brother S√∏ren. He said to them: You dear men and friends! See how un-Christian your fellow citizens have mishandled me! Especially Peter Nielsen, Oluf Maler, Lars B√∏nder, and many others I do not know, who have struck me, so that I cannot but suffer death.\\" At last the town bailiff, Peter Madsen, came to the aforesaid Brother S√∏ren together with a few other citizens and asked him if he would accuse anyone of causing his death, in case he should suffer death. But Brother S√∏ren replied: \\"You should know that if I had remained in my friary, then I wouldn't be so weak and sick as I am now. But though I harbour no hatred or resentment against those who mishandled me so inhumanly, I would like to forgive them for the love of Jesus Christ's sake, he who has suffered even more for my sake. I have enough to think about with the pains in my body until I can overcome even that. But their judgement, who have mishandled and beat me so cruelly, I leave to the righteous judge who shall judge all things righteously. I will not craft my words, so that I run into difficulties if I survive, though I don't believe that I shall survive.\\" Also (there came) two of the aforesaid persons or men to Brother S√∏ren, who had struck him. They acknowledged their guilt and asked for his forgiveness which they also obtained. But others of those who had struck him continued in their stiff-necked wickedness and did not come to ask for forgiveness. (Returning now to the account of the expulsion) Also many citizens struck nearly all the other friars to the ground, they were mistreated as if attacked by wolves, they were struck with swords, and like miserable asses dragged by the arms out of the friary. Yes, so cruel and inhuman were they mistreated that I believe fully and completely that if a Jew or a heathen had seen such actions and so miserable a sight that they could not withhold their tears. The king's mercenaries and knights who witnessed it were extremely saddened and felt the greatest sympathy and said: \\"O, how cruel and inhuman are the citizens of this town!\\" and \\"How hard a people there are in this Danish land! In our homelands when the virtuous ones were driven out, no one struck them so, or mistreated them in such a manner; just the opposite, people assisted them with clothing and money and other things necessary to the sustenance of life.\\" Such things and many others said the leaders of the mercenaries to the brethren to comfort them. Also Master Niels Vinther and many other good people had much compassion with the brethren and wept. A few days after the expulsion two other brother priests, Thomas and Kristoffer died because of their wounds and blows which they received from the cursed Lutherans, but that must be left to the righteous judge, he who knows the depth of all things. At the holy time of Easter when all true Christians who have reached the age of understanding were used to partaking of the most important communion, the brethren were unable to receive the sacred and honourable sacrament when they celebrated services behind closed doors, the Lutherans had forbidden it (communion) as if the brethren had been heathens, excommunicated, or cursed.3 They also held the Guardian, Brother Anders Bertelsen imprisoned for eight weeks and threatened him with the bread of persecution and the drink of tribulation. Of real bread whereby they could maintain life in him, he received none, not so much as a crumb and that doesn't happen even for law breakers who shall be hanged or racked. Therefore, he was forced to beg from good Christian people for life's sustenance and (received) that only if he gave assurances that he would not run away. And despite the fact that the good Father Guardian and the brethren left good provision in the friary at the time they were driven out, they could obtain no provisions from there. That and much else must the Ystad brethren at the time of the expulsion endured from the unholy Lutherans side; and this has Father Anders Bertelsen himself told me, Brother Erasmus Olavi in good faith and forthrightly; he protested and proved it with word and script and called upon the Almighty God to witness that the preceding explanation is true as spoken. 1: The Feast of the Annunciation was most often celebrated on 25 March, essentially New Year's Day in the old calendar. 2 Grillwork or the 'grille' is a loose translation of the Danish word 'gitter' which denotes a wrought iron fence or gates. This refers to the practice of gating off the monk's part of the church from the rest of the congregation which normally came to hear mass in the friary church. Aarhus Cathedral still has the grille in place as a work of medieval art. Many churches in Denmark 'gate off' chapels, funeral monuments, and other spaces to prevent unwanted intrusion with similar wrought iron gates or fences. 3 One might ask the question, given the violent treatment the Franciscans had received at the hands of the citizens of Ystad, why were they still there weeks later? It may well be that they were awaiting some word about Father Bertelsen's appeal 'to the king and State council', but Frederik I had less than a year to live, the State Council was in the process of gathering support to prevent Duke Christian from taking the throne and tipping the balance of power in favor of the Lutherans. Certainly the brethren remained at Ystad for some time after the expulsion. The expulsion happened before the Feast of the Annunciation and at Easter they were celebrating mass behind 'closed doors' perhaps a reference to the friary. Brother S√∏ren Jacobsen's reference, \\"If I had remained in the friary...\\" indicates that he was perhaps taken in by more compassionate citizens of Ystad. Guardian Anders Bertelsen remained imprisoned eight weeks before he was released and went to tell his story to Brother Erasmus Olai. Chapter 13 Concerning the Friary in N√¶stved The history about the way whereupon it happened that the brethren from N√¶stved Friary were expelled. It happened in the Lord's year 1532 the day after the glorious Virgin Mary's Assumption1 and took place at that time and in this manner: The ungodly heretic Herr Mogens Gj√∏, who was both the devils slave and soldier had certainly often threatened that he would chase the brethren from that place, despite (the fact) that his grandfather and wife were buried there and his great grandfather and his wife had donated a chalice for the correcting of their souls which he (Gj√∏) took from the expelled brothers. First this Mogens Gj√∏ sought to introduce a few Lutheran preachers to the town and he got them to shout out against the brethren. When that didn't work, he sent some of those who had left the order namely, Johannes from K√∏ge and Niels Christensen, two good-for-nothings who respected the preaching of Brother Rasmus Olsen, he who was lector and a defender of the faith. When they had done that, they made notes on a few points from his lesson which they incorrectly found less than true and reported their findings to Mogens Gj√∏. Mogens Gj√∏ used this as an opportunity to send word and forbid Brother Rasmus and others permission to preach until they met with that strict knight to answer the points (that had been noted). But when the aforesaid Brother Rasmus took the worthy Father's Vice-Guardian, Brother Jacob Jensen and went with him to the State Council in Copenhagen to answer himself the points he had preached. When they arrived in the council, they read out all the charges in Danish; and quickly both lay and clerics in the council were completely and wholly acknowledged as exemplary Christians. Many wept and feared that God's punishment would fall upon them when they put such things in doubt. Tyge Krabbe took those articles which were approved by the council and the king. When the king saw them, he turned the case over to Mogens Gj√∏ for closer examination. He called immediately two or three Lutherans and got them to research the abovementioned articles more closely. When they (Brothers Rasmus and Jacob) were examined and condemned by their (Lutheran's) blind judgement, Mogens wrote secretly to N√¶stved that the articles under investigation were heretical according to the State Council. He wrote a completely meaningless set of proofs which I believe the councillors have still. When all of this happened, the two brothers returned to N√¶stved. Again later the friary's Vice-Guardian spoke to Brother Jacob and the worthy Vice- Guardian in the presence of Brother Johannes Nyborg and sent them hurrying to Roskilde to the Father Guardian (saying) that he should hurry personally to N√¶stved. But there ( in Roskilde) on account of a royal warrant the brothers were expelled in the presence of the minister and all the accumulated alms were stolen2. 1 The Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was celebrated on 15 August and commemorates the taking into Heaven of Mary, the mother of Jesus. 2 Though no specific account of the expulsion of the Greyfriars from Roskile can be dated to the approximate time as evidenced by the eyewitness account of Guardian of N√¶stved Friary in the fall of 1532. Chapter 14 Concerning the Friary at Kalundborg It so happened that the brethren were expelled from Kalundborg Friary in 1532 at the Feast of Raising of the Cross1. When Mogens Gj√∏, that ungodly and heretic man, many times threatened the brethren in Kalundborg that he would drive them out of the friary in another way since the citizens of Kalndborg would not do it. He ordered the bailiff of the castle before he left for Jutland to get all the brothers out of the friary, which he did. It happened such that Brother Mechior who was the Guardian of the friary was his fellow in the heresy and he offered but little opposition. It was agreed between him and Mogens Gj√∏ that he would remain and become the heretic preacher in the town of Kalundborg which we have also determined he became. 1 The Feast of the Raising of the Cross occurs on 14 September in the liturgical year. It commemorates the finding of the True Cross by St Helena, the mother of Emperor Constantine, in 325 at Jerusalem. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on the location. Chapter 15 Concerning the Friary at Horsens This is the way in which the brethren were expelled from Horsens Friary. After the cursed Lutherans had introduced and carried out countless persecutions and threats against the brothers before they were driven from their friary and after the forementioned Mogens Gj√∏, the persecutor of all the peaceful (ones), had encouraged many Lutheran citizens of Horsens to drive the brethren out of their friary. They attempted many times to tempt them if they could not be persuaded to leave their friary. They took hold of every single brother and promised them a handsome sum (of money) and a passable reward, but they still received a negative answer. They could not get the brothers to go out because of agreements because Manderup Holck had the founder's right over the friary and was very friendly-minded toward the brethren. So they held council with the ungodly gentleman, the above named Mogens Gj√∏ and he convinced these citizens to refer themselves to the king and carry before him for him (the King) the monstrances and chalices from the church in Horsens to get him to sell them our friary which also happened. Therefore, the two Horsens citizens namely master of the town, Lars Jensen and another went away to the king's majesty who was staying at Gottorp (in southern Jutland) and obtained from him a letter concerning the brothers' friary. This letter from his royal highness was read out for the brothers in the friary in their daily assembly the day before Saint Barbara's martyrdom (4 December). Thereafter the aforementioned brothers found out how many and how false things were spoken while (they were) with his royal highness. So on godly (St) Thomas the Martyr's Day1 the Bishop of Kent was all compassion withdrawn from all the brothers from the friary at Horsens for and that self- same day they were expelled from their friary, inhumanly and confused, without any justice or concern on the year and date mentioned above.

Habitat and biology A shell of Lithophaga lithophaga These bivalves live mainly in the area battered by the waves, but they can reach depths of 125 to 200 m.Sea Life Base They bore into marine rocks, producing a boring called Gastrochaenolites. Their growth is very slow, and to reach the 5 cm length, they require 15 to 35 years. They feed on plankton, algae and debris by filtering them from the water. They reach the sexual maturity after about two years. The number of eggs that are released in a season reach about 120,000 to about 4.5 million. The fertilization takes place in the open water.S.

SINIS AGE AND GROWTH OF LITHOPHAGA LITHOPHAGA (LINNAEUS, 1758) (BIVALVIA: MYTILIDAE), BASED ON ANNUAL GROWTH LINES IN THE SHELL Description Shells of Lithophaga lithophaga can reach a length of about . They are yellowish or brownish, almost cylindrical, rounded at both ends. The interior is whitish iridescent purple with a pink tinge. These shells are relatively thin. The surface is nearly smooth, covered with growth lines, which sometimes can be quite rough.  Etymology  The Lithophaga lithophaga's name is derived from the Greek word lithos: meaning rock/stone and the Greek word phaga/phago: meaning to eating or devouring. Human culture Historically these shells are considered a delicacy, cooked and served in a broth of white wine, garlic and parsley. Commercial collection The extraction of the shells require dismantling of the rocks where they live and can lead to desertification of the coast. Several governments have restricted the collection of these shells or even made it wholly illegal, in order to protect the rocks on which they are found. These countries include Croatia, Italy, Slovenia, France, Greece, Montenegro, and others, including participants in the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). , its population distributed over the Turkish coastline is not considered to be under threat.

MV Princess of the Stars (sometimes mistakenly referred to as Princess of Stars)Princess of the Stars is seen on the port side of the ship, but Princess of Stars is also used by her shipping company, Sulpicio Lines. was a ferry owned by Filipino shipping company Sulpicio Lines. She capsized on June 21, 2008, off the coast of San Fernando, Romblon, at the height of Typhoon Fengshen (PAGASA name: Frank), which passed directly over Romblon as a Category 2 storm. Design Built in 1984 by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. Aio, Japan, the 23,824-ton ferry MV Princess of the Stars, formerly MV Ferry Lilac of Shin Nihonkai Ferry, had a total passenger capacity of 1,992 people. In Japan, she was originally a pure roro ferry, carrying cars and trucks, not passengers. In 2004, she was sold to Sulpicio Lines, to replace the slightly ageing Princess Of The Universe as flagship of the fleet. There she was refitted, added an additional lower passenger deck and added a cargo ramp at the stern port side. Under Sulpicio, she had trouble-free voyages for 4 years until June 2008. Disaster Princess of the Stars, flagship of the Sulpicio Lines fleet, left the port of Manila on June 20, 2008, en route to Cebu City. Although Typhoon Fengshen, locally known as Typhoon Frank, had made landfall at Samar Island earlier the same day, Princess of the Stars was permitted to sail because the vessel was large enough to stay afloat in the typhoon's periphery. However, Fengshen unexpectedly changed course later that day, placing the ferry in serious danger of being overwhelmed by the storm. At midday on June 21, the ferry sent out a distress signal; radio contact was lost at 12:30 PST (04:30 GMT). The mayor of San Fernando, Nanette Tansingco, sent a speedboat and confirmed that the ferry had a hole in the hull and was partially submerged, and that several bodies had been found nearby. Later reports revealed that the hole in the hull was actually the ship's bow thruster. Location of the storm and Princess of the Stars when the ship lost radio contact at 11 am June 21, 2008. The total number of people aboard was initially reported as 747 ‚Äì 626 passengers and 121 crew (575 adults, 20 children, 31 infants and 121 officers and crew members).http://www.philstar.com/cebu-news/69194/sulpicio-spokesman- says-coast-guard-not-blame However, Sulpicio Lines announced that there had been 755 manifested passengers and 111 crew members, making a total of 866.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/106387/task-force- mulls-4-options-for-capsized- vessel/story/http://www.irinnews.org/report/79100/philippines-collaborative- approach-helps-survivors-typhoon- fengshenhttp://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/106852/sulpicio-still- undecided-on-re-floating-princess/story/ It is possible that there were more passengers not recorded in the manifest. According to the official figures last made (final toll) there were 814 dead and missing and only 56 known survivors, making to a total of 870 people onboard.https://www.ferrysafety.org/Philippines Report [6].docx According to an account given by four survivors, who managed to swim to nearby Sibuyan Island, Princess of the Stars had not malfunctioned (as had been previously reported), but ran into rough seas off the coast of Romblon. At 11:30 am, passengers had been told to put on life jackets, and fifteen minutes later, the captain gave the order to abandon ship. The ship began to tilt at around midday. The survivors witnessed many people jumping into the water, while some made it onto life rafts. Many of them were not wearing life jackets, and according to the four survivors, the crew were more concerned with saving themselves than with assisting the passengers. The ferry finally capsized at 1 pm noontime. After the Navy vessel closest to the area had to abort its rescue mission due to \\"gigantic waves, pounding rain, and gusty winds\\", according to the spokesman of the Philippine Navy, another rescue ship finally reached Princess of the Stars more than 24 hours after it lost radio contact. However, Philippine Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Senior Grade Arman Balilo said: \\"They haven't seen anyone. They're scouring the area. They're studying the direction of the waves to determine where survivors may have drifted.\\" By June 23, four bodies had been recovered from the scene by the Coast Guard and the Philippine Navy. Another 35 corpses and 40 survivors washed ashore at Burias Island, Masbate, the same day, but it is likely that the bodies came not only from the Princess of the Stars but also from other vessels that capsized in the typhoon. Some of the 40 survivors said they came from MV Lake Paway, which departed from Mindanao but later sank at sea. The Philippine Coast Guard reported on June 24, 2008, that it accounted for only 115 (48 survivors confirmed, 67 others confirmed dead, 747 missing) of the 862 passengers and crew of Princess of the Stars. Navy divers found no survivors inside the wreck when they entered the upturned hulk of the ferry. They did, however, find 15 bodies inside the ship's dining area and two others in the bridge. It was so dark inside the ferry that it was impossible to tell how many more corpses were inside. A helicopter from a U.S. military ship, the , found 12 bodies floating near Masbate island, but it was not clear if they were from the Princess of the Stars. The victims' families accused Sulpicio Lines and the Philippine Coast Guard of negligence in allowing the ship to get underway despite the bad weather. They further blamed Sulpicio for not personally informing them about the tragedy, the details of the accident, and the condition of the ship and passengers. Sulpicio Lines' counsel stated that the ship was never advised by the Coast Guard that it was not safe to sail. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo demanded an explanation from port authorities: \\"Why did you allow it to sail and why was there no ample warning? I want answers.\\" The Maritime Industry Authority (Marina) ordered the grounding of all Sulpicio Lines vessels, pending an investigation, and Vice President Noli de Castro presided over the first meeting of the newly created \\"Task Force Princess Stars\\". Sulpicio Lines offered to pay the bereaved families 200,000 pesos ($4,500) each, by way of compensation. =Dangerous cargo removal= On June 27, 2008, recovery efforts ceased due to the discovery that 10,000 kilos of the dangerous pesticide endosulfan were on board. The government announced that they were considering filing charges, as it is illegal to transport dangerous goods on passenger vessels in the Philippines. Titan Salvage was contracted by the owners to remove the endosulfan, along with some additional dangerous cargos in a second container. Both cargos were located in containers in the \\"D\\" deck of the capsized vessel. Titan Salvage assembled a salvage team consisting of the following companies: Harbor Star, a Philippine tug and salvage company; Global Diving & Salvage, a U.S. based diving company specializing in hazardous diving operations; and South Pacific Environmental, a Guam-based company specializing in hazardous chemical mitigation. The salvage team began the actual endosulfan recovery operations on September 24, 2008, and by October 5, all 402 of the 25 kg drums had been safely recovered from the first 40 ft container located near the aft end of \\"D\\" deck in about 85 ft of water. The salvage team then proceeded to remove the other dangerous cargos from a 20 ft container located toward the center of \\"D\\" deck in about 35 ft of water. On October 11, it was determined that all of the dangerous cargo located in the second container had been safely recovered. The salvage team drilled into the ship's hull to remove the ship's fuel, and this phase was completed by October 17. Approximately 200,000 liters were recovered. =Continuation of body recovery efforts= Once the dangerous cargos were removed, the body recovery effort continued. From October 27 until November 10, divers from Harbor Star and the Coast Guard recovered 199 bodies from \\"C\\", \\"B\\" and \\"A\\" decks. PCG commandant Vice Adm. Wilfredo Tamayo stated: \\"We are not expecting to see 500 bodies. We would be lucky to get half of that.\\" Divers, however, failed to enter the engine room, and some other areas, due to inaccessibility and danger. The bodies were stored on MV Tacloban Princess. Forensic doctors from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and Interpol were waiting in Cebu City to attempt identification. The NBI's Doctor Bautista said, thereafter, that DNA matching, assisted and funded by Interpol, would be done in the International Commission on Missing Persons laboratory in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Most of the initial bodies recovered had detached limbs or heads and disintegrated flesh, after more than four months underwater. The Philippine Coast Guard reported that only 56 people were known to have survived the maritime tragedy. Around 350 bodies had been recovered, with the remainder presumed to be trapped inside the capsized vessel. By May 2010, the wreck had been longitudinally cut in half and towed to shallower waters, where divers could more safely search the interior. A further 47 sets of human remains were recovered, and turned over to the National Bureau of Investigation and the Public Attorney's Office for forensic testing.  Investigation BMI final report= The five-member Philippines Board of Marine Inquiry, in its 65-page report dated August 25, 2008, submitted to the Maritime Industry Authority or Marina, found Sulpicio Lines and its captain liable for the tragedy. The BMI recommended that Marina \\"consider the suspension of the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) of Sulpicio Lines in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations (and its criminal liability for the sinking).\\" The final report blamed human error, and ruled that the ship's missing and presumed dead captain, Florencio Marimon, \\"miscalculated\\" the risk of continuing the trip to Cebu despite the stormy weather. According to the report: \\"The immediate cause of the capsizing of MV Princess of the Stars was the failure of the Master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment that brought MV Princess of the Stars in harm's way into the eye of Typhoon Frank ... The shipping firm is found negligent for its failure to exercise its duty in ensuring that they transport passengers and cargo safely to (their) destination.\\" Sulpicio Lines subsequently announced their intention to appeal the decision. Sulpicio Lines, the second-largest cargo carrier in the Philippines, accounts for 40% of all cargo movement across the country. Some commentators ‚Äì such as Robert Go, former president of the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry ‚Äì argued that suspending Sulpicio's activities would cause significant disruption to the country's economy over the Christmas season.  International response United States= The United States donated US$100,000 for the victims through the Philippine Red Cross, and sent the USNS GYSGT Fred W. Stockham and a P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft to contribute to the rescue. During a one-on-one meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Aroyo, the United States extended its condolences to the people of the Philippines and pledged that more assistance would be given, including the deployment of the U.S. Naval carrier group to assist in any rescue or retrieval operations.

He was awarded Ekushey Padak in 1978 and Independence Day Award in 1996 by the Government of Bangladesh. Official Website  Family  Ahmed in Calcutta Government School of Art in the 1930s Ahmed was born on 23 June 1922, in Bhabanipur, Kolkata. His father, Matinuddin Ahmed, was a sub-registrar in the land office of the Government of Bengal and his mother, Bibi Jamila Khatun, was a housewife. Three generations of his family had lived in their paternal homestead in Bhabanipur. Ahmad's paternal grandfather, Aminuddin Ahmed, was a popular doctor in Bhabanipur. Aminuddin Ahmed was known as \\"Bachu Daktar\\" by the local residents. The road in front of his house was named \\"Bachu Daktar Lane\\" after Aminuddin Ahmed's death under the initiative of the \\"Kolkata municipality\\". Ahmed's father died when he was young. Bhabanipur was adjacent to shahebpara chaurangi. although people from different provinces lived in this area,majority of the inhabitants were culturally conscious Bengali Hindus and Muslims. Baliganj of south Kolkata was then in the suburbs,populated sparsely.  Education  Ahmed's studied art at Calcutta Government School of Art in 1936. Safiuddin came into proximity with many people while studying in the art school from 1930 to 1942. As he practiced painting nature studies and landscapes and went to draw people with the students to the bank of the Ganges,the zoo and the Sealdah station, likewise he want to studio in the home of the teacher prohlad, which always had its door open to visitors, was also frequented by Dilip Dasgupta, Zainul Abedin and others. This means, safiuddin was one of those who spent most of the hours of the day practicing art, through studies outside the school and in prohlad's studio. Other thAn this, as students they regularly went to the Radha area at the western border of Bengal to Birbhum and the adjacent dumka area at the adjacent dumka area of Jharkhand. The everyday life of the santals of that area, the dry landscape, vegetation, slowly flowing rivers, sky, horizons of Radha have repeatedly appeared as subjects of paintings and prints done during his student life. The second world war started in Europe in 1939. In 1958 he completed the diploma courses in printmaking from the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London with distinction.  Career  Ahmed was the pioneer of printmaking in Bangladesh. He, along with Zainul Abedin and others, played an important role in the foundation of the Dhaka Art College (now the Faculty of Fine Arts of Dhaka University.Artist Safiuddin Ahmed's 85th birth anniversary today The Daily Star, 23 June 2007). He was employed in Prahlad Karmarkar's studio. In one early painting there, he departed from pure narration to add his own perception and variation in the etching. Ramendranath chakravorty as a teacher of printmaking as a creative art form.inspired by them safiuddin learned the techniques of printmaking along with painting.even in the mid-twentieth century printmaking was not considered a mainstream medium in this subcontinent.even now in the government art college of kolkata at the bachelor's degree level printmaking is taught as a subject painting .the print making medium was not at that time among the mainstream media like painting and sculpture and one of safiuddin's greatest achievements is that he helped raise this discipline of apparently secondary importance by adopting it as the main medium for his creative works and assisted it to reach a status equal to that of painting and sculpture.while living in kolkata, the life of indigenous santals, give him inspiration to draw various picture. But after coming to east Pakistan the look, posture and the environment of his picture changed.\\"Empty basket\\" ,lemonade stand(pl.8.15)painted in oil colors in 1952 are quite perceptibly pictures of east bengal.The two painting :Fishing\\" and \\"carpenter\\"done between 1954 and 1956 deserve special mention two reasons.In these two painting in oil colors we notice that he has tried to experiment with shapes more than in his landscape which are composed with the combination of light and shade.The color of these two paintings are strongly flat,the edges or contours of the forms subjective exaggeration has been resorted to rather than attempting to remain faithful to pictorially reconstruct the visual world in his own way.As a result,from this period his picture gradually start to move towards abstraction.In 1958 he completed the diploma course in printmaking from the central school of arts and crafts of London with distinction from 1956 to 1974.He visited different galleries of England ,France,Italy,Germany,Belgium,Netherlands,Switzerland,Soviet union and India. Ahmed helped raise the profile of a printmaking, a discipline often considered of secondary importance, by adopting it as his main medium. He inspired many other artists from the subcontinent to begin printmaking. Though Ahmed had been born and brought up in the city, he selected the landscape and life of the people in particularly remote areas of Radha Vangaand Jharkhand as the setting of his works. At the beginning of the \`30s,Abanindranath painted the \\"Arabian nights series.This series is the last one in his fine aesthetic romance style.In 1939 in the background of the second world war he took his brush in hand .his fine.soft style was transformed.He started to draw the pictures of the \\"Krishnamangal\\" series where painted the killing of seventeen asuras or demons by the child krishna. In the oil paintings Sunlit Hut, Dumka-1, Dumka-2 and Dumka ShalForest done in 1946, he applied the pigment in strokes like the Impressionists; and did not create sfumato by mixing paints.

He has been called the \\"leading theorist\\" of modern synagogue design,Philip Nobel, Art/Architecture; What Design For a Synagogue Spells Jewish?, New York Times, December 2, 2001. and \\"the most prolific architect in Jewish history.\\"Michael Z. Wise, \\"America's Most Prolific Synagogue Architect ,\\" The Forward, March 9, 2001. Biography Percival Goodman was born in New York City to wealthy parents who were artists. His brother was the noted writer and sociologist Paul Goodman. In 1925, Percival Goodman received the Society of Beaux-Arts Architects Paris Prize which sent him to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France for architectural training.Paul Goldberger, Percival Goodman, 85, Synagogue Designer, Dies, The New York Times, October 12, 1989. In the earlier part of his career, Goodman designed department store interiors, apartments, and country houses. He also had an interest in urban planning: he submitted a 1930 proposal for the Palace of the Soviets in Moscow, and proposed a master plan for Long Island City. He was an early critic of Robert Moses' parkway plans for New York City, preferring to \\"improve the center and make livable neighborhoods\\"; he also criticized the garden city movement of Ebenezer Howard and the Ville Radieuse of Le Corbusier. Goodman called himself \\"an agnostic who was converted by Hitler\\", and after World War II he became more interested in Jewish architecture. At a 1947 conference of the Reform Jewish movement, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Goodman advocated the use of modern architecture for new Jewish buildings, rather than following the models of older churches and synagogues. He quickly began to receive commissions. Many of these were for new buildings in suburban areas reachable only by car, and Goodman responded by using a variety of designs intended to attract motorists' attention. In 1949 his proposal was selected for a large Holocaust memorial in Manhattan's Riverside Park, but it was never built. His student Peter Eisenman much later completed a Holocaust memorial in Berlin, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. His design for B'nai Israel in Millburn, New Jersey (1951) has been called \\"the first truly modern synagogue\\".George James, Places of the Heart; Historic Houses of Worship, From Soaring Spires to Simple Quaker Meeting Houses, The New York Times, March 28, 1999; see also Matthew Baigell, Jewish Art in America: An Introduction, p.108 (Rowman & Littlefield, 2006). Goodman's design for B'nai Israel included sculpture, painting, and ark curtain design by Herbert Ferber, Robert Motherwell, and Adolph Gottlieb, respectively.Janay Jadine Wong, \\"Synagogue art of the 1950s: a new context for abstraction,\\" Art Journal (Winter 1994) This integration of modern sculpture and artworks, along with the use of natural light, became hallmarks of Goodman's work. Goodman \\"stressed the human scale in his prayer halls and collaboration with modern artists where expressive symbolism was warranted\\", according to Philip Nobel at the New York Times. Percival Goodman was also considered a distinguished urban theorist. He was the co-author, with his brother Paul, of the landmark urban planning text Communitas, and he illustrated editions of a number of his brother's other works. Percival Goodman was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He was a professor at the Columbia University architecture school for more than 25 years, where notable students included Peter Eisenman.

He notably played in the Football League for Grimsby Town from 2002 until 2004 before moving on to play for Gainsborough Trinity, and Boston United. CareerGrimsby Town= Parker was a product of the Grimsby Town youth setup and made his move into the first team in October 2002 when the club were playing in the First Division. Parker and striker David Soames were promoted into the first team following injuries to senior players and would go on to make his first team debut under manager Paul Groves, who with first team defenders Steve Chettle, Georges Santos, John McDermott and Darren Barnard in the Mariners squad, Parker had a collective group of veteran role models to follow. In his most notable appearance for the club, Parker was drafted in to make a substitute appearance on Boxing Day 2002 when the club played against Derby County at Pride Park . With the majority of Grimsby's regular back four side lined through injury, Parker came on to replace Terry Cooke in a game in which he marked former Manchester City legend Georgi Kinkladze out of the game. Goals from David Soames and a double from John Oster polished off Derby in a 3‚Äì1 victory. Grimsby were relegated from the First Division in the 2002‚Äì2003 season and in the 2003‚Äì2004 season Parker failed to make an impact under Groves and his later replacement Nicky Law. After making only four appearances in his second season with The Mariners, Parker was released at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season =Gainsborough Trinity= As a free agent Parker initially struggled to find a club, and after a trial with Scarborough and a short spell with Brigg Town, he decided to join Conference North side Gainsborough Trinity. Parker was soon joined by younger brother Liam who had been released at youth level by Grimsby following the end of his youth scholarship. Wes played four seasons with Gainsborough, and was ever present when the club reached the first round of the FA Cup on three occasions missing out against York City, Barnet and Hartlepool United. Despite transfer speculation linking him with a move to York City, it was local rivals Boston United who finally secured his signature when he made the switch to South Lincolnshire in May 2008. =Boston United= Almost immediately after his move to Boston, the club were demoted from the Conference North league to the Northern Premier League for financial irregularities, and instant speculation to Parker's future was soon put about. Gainsborough boss Steve Charles who had just lost Parker to Boston attempted to instantly bring him back to The Northolme, but Wes deciding against the move to commit himself to his contract and agreed to stay at York Street. Younger brother Liam also followed him to Boston as did the third Parker brother MaCauley who joined the club's youth system. Following the conclusion of the 2008‚Äì2009 season Parker was one of several players released by the club's new management staff. =Return to Gainsborough= On 29 May 2009 Parker re-joined Gainsborough Trinity for the second time in his career. Initially a first team regular again with The Blues, Parker lost his way in the team when Brian Little was appointed manager by the club's new chairman Peter Swann. Trinity had seen an influx of new signings flow into the club as Little made full use of his chairman's large cash boost. Eventually by the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season Parker's contract was not renewed. =Wealdstone= After initially signing for Isthmian League Premier Division side Horsham, Parker signed a contract with Horsham's league rivals Wealdstone. He has since been made captain of the team, leading his team to victories against Barrow and Cambridge in the FA Trophy 2011‚Äì12 as Wealdstone made a run to the semi- finals of the competition only to lose to Newport county 3‚Äì1. Parker made his 100th appearance for Wealdstone on 23 October 2012 in a Middlesex Charity Cup tie against Bedfont & Feltham. Personal life Parker is the eldest of three brothers who have all played football but he is the only to have spent time as a full professional. Liam was snubbed a professional contract and was released by Grimsby Town as a youngster, he has since turned out for Boston Town and Boston United.Liam Parker signed for the Pilgrims from neighbours Boston Town in June 2008 shortly after his brother Wes had also joined the clu Macauley has spent time with Boston United, and Skegness Town ReferencesExternal links * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Skegness Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Boston United F.C. players Category:Gainsborough Trinity F.C. players Category:Wealdstone F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Northern Premier League players Category:Isthmian League players Category:National League (English football) players ","title":"Wes Parker (footballer)"},{"id":"18069068","text":"K≈çmy≈ç-ji in Zaimokuza is an area within the Kamakura, Kanagawa Pref., in Japan that runs along the sea from Cape Iijima near Kotsubo harbor to the estuary of the Namerigawa.

Watson Lake and Willow Lake are small man-made reservoirs in this formation. The Peavine National Recreation Trail follows the former railbed of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway through the Granite Dells. This winding portion of the railroad was known as the \\"Peavine\\" because its twisting curves resembled that of a pea vine.

Geology The precambrianRoadside Geology of Arizona, p. 168. Dells' granite has been theoretically dated at 1.4 billion years old. Its pluton was intruded at a depth of around one or two miles (1.6 to 3.2 km). These cover rocks have since been eroded away. Weathering along joints produced the rounded boulders and other unusual rock formations that characterize the Granite Dells. This process is called spheroidal weathering, and is common in granitic terrains.Prescott Area Geological Field Guide, 1999, prepared for Earth Science Week.

It is more accurately described as a set of variations on a theme, rather than a true rhapsody. It was premi√®red on October 29, 1891, and its performance lasts approximately nine minutes. Background Rachmaninoff in 1892, after he graduated from the Conservatory While still a student at Moscow Conservatory, Rachmaninoff wrote to Natalia Skalon on mentioning that he had begun work on a piece for two pianos that he wanted to play with Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Siloti. He dated the manuscript January 12-15, 1891 [O.S.], implying that he had the composition in his head at the time of the letter, and only recorded the days he notated it on paper. Despite his stated intentions, he began rehearsing with Leonid Maximov, who had been a fellow student of Nikolai Zverev and pupil of Siloti, to play at a student concert at the Conservatory on March 8, 1891. However, Zverev, still upset over Rachmaninoff's request for a separate composing room, did not allow them to play together, so at the concert Rachmaninoff ended up conducting his choral work Deus Meus (1890) instead. The Rhapsody received its first performance after he graduated, on October 29, 1891, played by Rachmaninoff and Josef Lh√©vinne at the Conservatory. Composition The piece is more often described as a set of variations rather than a true rhapsody, and a letter from Rachmaninoff's friend Vladimir Wilshaw describes the possible origin of the composition as a session in which Rachmaninoff improvised on a melody set forth by pianist Yuri Sakhnovsky. Although both he and Lh√©vinne were more than capable performers, after the premiere, Rachmaninoff considerably simplified three passages. This is cited as the first of many future instances in which he would revise some of his pieces for no apparent reason, since it could not have been the ability of the performers that caused him to do so. Reception It is natural for a composition of variations to repeat the theme, but it is noted that the Rhapsody lacks the textural contrast shown in his later works, although it is very virtuosic and brilliant.

He served in the Queensland Legislative Assembly as a Liberal from 1912 to 1915, before winning the Division of Lilley as a Nationalist at the 1917 federal election. Mackay joined the new United Australia Party (UAP) in 1931 and served as Speaker of the House of Representatives from 1932 until his retirement in 1934. Early life Mackay was born at Copperfield, near Clermont in Queensland, to Scottish-born carpenter Hugh Mackay and Jane, n√©e Baird. He attended the state schools at Clermont and Bundaberg before becoming an apprentice printer at the Peak Downs Telegram in 1887. In 1894 he was promoted to foreman printer, and finally became managing editor. He married Edith Ann Heard on 23 September 1896 at the Wesleyan Church in Clermont, after which he joined his sister Barbara in the local bookshop and newsagency. He was elected to Clermont Town Council in 1882 and served as mayor 1900‚Äì02. Mackay moved to Lismore in New South Wales in 1902 before leasing a dairy farm at McLean's Ridge. Shortly afterwards, in 1905, the family moved back to Queensland, settling at Gympie, where Mackay opened an auctioneering and real estate business in partnership with Ray King.

At the time of the collapse Kentucky Central had over $43 billion in assets, making it the seventh largest insurance collapse in United States history, and at the time the largest business collapse in Kentucky history. History Kentucky Central was a small regional life insurance company based in Louisville, Kentucky until 1959 when controlling interest in the company was purchased by Garvice Kincaid, who was also named CEO of KCL until his death. Already one of the most successful businessmen in Kentucky, Kincaid owned interests in radio and television broadcasting, banking, finance, real estate, and was also a managing partner in his own law firm when he purchased KCL. In 1963, Kincaid announced plans to move the company to Lexington, Kentucky in an attempt to consolidate his many business interests in the Central Kentucky region. Kentucky Central's move came during a \\"golden era\\" of business in Lexington, as the city's economy moved from being agrarian in nature (centering on the tobacco and Thoroughbred industry) as other major corporations such as IBM, Ashland Oil, and Jerrico moved to or began expanding operations in the city.Garvace D. Kincaid; University of Kentucky Alumni Association; http://www.ukalumni.net/pages.php?page_id=12&id;=123 As Lexington and Kentucky Central grew during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kincaid had a vision for the future of the city and the financial resources available to make his vision a reality. During this time he began investing profits from KCL into various business ventures, including real estate development projects in the downtown Lexington area. The centerpiece of his vision would be Kincaid Towers, a 22-floor high-rise structure at a cost of $20 million, which took nearly six years to complete.Wright, John. Lexington Heart of the Bluegrass. Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky. 1994 Kincaid would not live to see his dream of Kentucky Central becoming the cornerstone of Lexington as a financial center of the Southeast when he died in 1975. He was succeeded as CEO by William \\"Bud\\" Burnett, who would run the company through an additional boom in the company's insurance, real estate, banking, agricultural and broadcasting businesses. However, he was also at the helm of KCL when the company began its collapse. =Association with the Webb Brothers= During Lexington's building boom of the early 1970s, Kincaid entered into a business partnership with brothers Donald and Dudley Webb. The Webb brothers, like Kincaid, were natives of Kentucky's Appalachian region who had previously conducted business with one of Kincaid's banking interests. Kincaid trusted the Webbs to carry out his vision of a modern downtown Lexington and the two parties entered into a number of business transactions, many of which were backed by loans from Kentucky Central. In these arrangements Kentucky Central would loan the Webbs money to develop real estate projects and the brothers would pay back loans on their various properties. Kincaid trusted the Webb brothers to such an extent that when loaning money for real estate and property development, he would only require Dudley Webb to sign a personal guarantee contract for the loans. This basic contract only assured that the guarantees would not be enforced unless the brothers diverted money from the project or if the project fell into dissolution. In either case the real estate would revert to Kentucky Central. Bud Burnett continued this agreement with the Webb brothers, where he would loan them funds for real estate projects with the agreement that the guarantees would only be enforced if the project fell into dissolution or if funds were found to be misappropriated or embezzled by the Webbs. This agreement would eventually be one of the factors leading to the downfall of Kentucky Central. During Burnett's tenure as CEO, Kentucky Central, through Donald and Dudley Webb, began developing even more properties under this arrangement. One reason for the increase in development between the two parties was the downtown revitalization projects associated with Lexington hosting the 1985 NCAA Men's and 1986 Women's Final Four, and the expansion of development projects throughout the Continental United States. Lexington's \\"new downtown\\" financed by KCL and developed and managed by the Webb brothers were viewed in the local media as a success story; however, less than ten years later both parties would be in deep financial trouble.Shewmaker, Hon. Steven. Judicial Record. Entered September 3, 1998. \\"The Kentucky Enron\\" One reason for the push into the real estate and property development market was due to higher than expected payouts on certain high-risk life insurance products. Kentucky Central had set sales goals which could not be met under the financial conditions given, meaning that the company felt it had to push as much revenue as possible out of its real estate investments. This would eventually lead to fewer internal controls and a risky business plan.The Lane Report - Legal January 1998 The contractual arrangement between Kentucky Central and the Webbs, along with similar agreements with other local business leaders, began to put a strain on Kentucky Central by the end of the 1980s. Multiple construction and development projects were later cited in court documents as being detrimental to the financial stability of the company. One such example was a 23-story development in the San Francisco, California financial district that was built by the Webb brothers with a loan of $46 million from Kentucky Central. When the Webbs could not sell the development, the property (valued at $25‚Äì30 million) reverted to KCL. It was eventually sold for $19 million, at a loss of $27 million. Other examples of similar arrangements took place with Webb developments in New Orleans, Colorado Springs, and Lexington. Kentucky Central's association with the Webb brothers was not its only financial misstep and there were other more glaring and questionable business practices in the company's final days, two of which center on former Kentucky Governor Wallace Wilkinson. Wilkinson and Burnett had been long-time friends and business associates. Burnett had supported Wilkinson's 1987 gubernatorial campaign, and Wilkinson appointed Burnett to the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees in 1988.University of Kentucky, Board of Trustees Meeting Minutes, December 13, 1988. http://pax.uky.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=ukbot;cc=ukbot;sid=e7ad5a873c0557444f60ceb58cf64cf3;rgn=full%20text;idno=1988-10-dec13;view=image;seq=1 Court documents showed that shortly after Wilkinson's election victory in 1987, he sold a hotel property in Frankfort, Kentucky assessed at just over $6 million to a subsidiary of Kentucky Central for $12.6 million, more than twice the assessed value. Also Wilkinson and his wife failed to make interest payments on $11.4 million worth of industrial revenue bonds used to construct a high-rise condominium in downtown Lexington for which Kentucky Central served as guarantor. No legal attempt was formally made to have the Wilkinsons pay the interest until after the company went into liquidation.SEC Info - Kentucky Central Life Insurance Co - 8-K - For 7/16/07 Wilkinson, the Webb brothers and other business associates also received loans from Kentucky Central at interest well below the market rate. The Bank of Louisville also received rates at well below market value, as well as other prominent Central Kentucky figures, including former University of Kentucky Athletic Director Larry Ivy and former Kentucky basketball coach Rick Pitino. This practice of issuing loans for high amounts at well under market interest rates also lead to the financial instability of Kentucky Central. For twenty-three years the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche served as the auditor of Kentucky Central's accounting and financial records.Deloitte & Touche settles Kentucky Central suit for $23 million - Business First of Louisville: One example involved Bruce Burnett (the son of CEO Bud Burnett) an independent insurance agent in Lexington, who had failed to turn over millions in Kentucky Central premiums paid by customers to the company, and the company in turn never sought payment until after the liquidation. =Collapse= The financial irregularities, loans granted at well under market rates, and failure to collect deficiencies through personal guarantees against more than 30 different borrowers on loans during the late 1980s and early 1990s left Kentucky Central with financial losses in excess of $141 million. On February 12, 1993 the Kentucky Department of Insurance seized Kentucky Central and, after an extensive audit, found the company to be insolvent. After nearly a century in business one of the nation's leading life insurance companies was effectively out of business and over 1000 employees were without work. Ill with brain cancer, Bud Burnett died soon after Kentucky Central was declared insolvent, and liquidation proceedings began in early 1994. One year later Jefferson-Pilot assumed the company's life and annuity responsibilities and provided $250 million in related support.Jeff-Pilot's bid chosen for Kentucky Central Life.

Also sued by the liquidators were Dudley, Donald (and his wife) Julie Webb as well as former governor Wallace Wilkinson. The Webbs were sued for $108 million, but settled after years of litigation for a combined $3.85 million.BluegrassReport.org: Surprise, Surprise: Main Defendants At Center Of Kentucky Central Life Collapse Are Fletcher-Rudolph Donors Steve Beshear controversy During the 2007 Gubernatorial campaign Democratic candidate Steve Beshear was accused by his opponent, then-Governor Ernie Fletcher, of having a role in the collapse of Kentucky Central. Beshear's law firm, Stites & Harbison, was hired to serve as general counsel to liquidator Donald Stephens, who was the state insurance commissioner. However, Stites & Harbison already represented the Bank of Louisville, whose holdings included millions of dollars of securities put up as collateral for a loan connected to Kentucky Central in a complicated real estate deal. Stephens asked another law firm in 1995 to look into allegations that Stites & Harbison had a conflict of interest representing the Office of Insurance while continuing to represent the Bank of Louisville. The report claimed Beshear was not directly involved but had \\"general knowledge\\" of the conflict of interest and should have told the insurance commissioner. Later a Jefferson County judge reviewed the case and found no legal or ethical violations on the part of Beshear.Kentucky Central Insurance: Latest Ethics Issue in Gov.'s Race Fletcher attempted to use the issue to show that a conflict of interest prevented Beshear from saving the company and drew a comparison between Beshear and Enron executives at the time of that company's collapse. However, the former Governor's attempts failed as he lost his re- election bid to Beshear by nearly 200,000 votes (18%).

It is located where the Rio Chama meets the Rio Grande, west of present-day Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico. The pueblo of Yuque Yunque was provided as a gesture of goodwill toward Juan de O√±ate, and he founded his colonial government there. It was moved to Santa Fe in 1610.https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/American_Latino_Heritage/San_Gabriel_de_Yunque_Ouinge.html The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. The archaeological site was leveled and plowed over in 1984, and a historical marker has been placed on the west side of the Rio Grande, off the old New Mexico State Road 74. Description and history The pueblos of Ohkay and Yunque were two interrelated Puebloan settlements, Ohkay's establishment estimated around 1200 CE and Yunque's around 1300. The present-day tribal lands of Ohkay Owingeh encompass the area of both settlements. When Juan de O√±ate arrived in 1598 to establish a Spanish provincial headquarters, he at first established a military camp outside the Ohkay pueblo, which he dubbed \\"San Juan\\" (a name by which the Ohkay pueblo was known for many years, before reclaiming its native name in the early 21st century.) The Puebloans agreed to make the Yunque pueblo, located between the Chama River and Rio Grande, available as a compound for the Spanish, and its residents were evacuated to Ohkay. In the fall of 1598, the Spanish erected a church and dug an acequia (water channel) to bring water to Yunque. The site remained New Mexico's colonial capital until 1610, when O√±ate was replaced by Pedro de Peralta, who established the Spanish capital at Santa Fe. The Yunque pueblo was either abandoned entirely by the Spanish, or left with a few colonists, but it was eventually abandoned entirely. The location of this early colonial capital was of recurring interest to historians, and was tentatively identified in the 1890s. In the 1930s, the National Park Service surveyed the area but was unable to make a definitive determination. Excavations in the 1940s and 1960s made it abundantly clear that the area was an early Spanish settlement site, with the church site and a military barracks among the structures whose remains were found. After these excavations, the natives began removing adobe bricks from the ruins for reuse, and the site was levelled and buried. A cross and memorial marker indicate the site.

David (chapter IV). Isarn was the Bishop of Grenoble from 950 until his death in 976. During the reign of Conrad the Peaceful he was instrumental in re-asserting Christian political authority in the south of the Kingdom of Burgundy, overrun by Saracens, and in restoring the shattered Church in the region. His methods in expelling the Saracens from his diocese, were similar to those used by his successful contemporary, William the Liberator in Provence. Isarn belonged to the family of the counts of Graisivaudan (Gravaisdun), a precursor district of the Dauphin√©, whose patronage of abbeys and proprietary churches resulted in considerable control of the local church at the time. Isarn was loyal to the diocese, however, being one of the few noblemen of the region not to flee the conquest of Grenoble by the Saracens.Versteegh, 371. In 965 Isarn led a counterattack against the Saracens (\\"Moors\\") and removed them from his diocese. In 972 a raiding party of Saracens from Fraxinetum captured Mayeuil, abbot of Cluny, while he was returning from a visit to Rome. According to Archibald Lewis, \\"it was this action which probably at last forced action against them.\\"Lewis, 222. Isarn began a programme of encastellation to bring the Dauphin√© back under Christian control. According to later sources, the bishop had in fact begun his castle-building programme not long after 950. Between that date and 974 Isarn had many castles constructed throughout his diocese, over all of which he maintained dominatio et servitia (lordship and service). He also pursued the re-cultivation of abandoned soil and the restoration of abandoned churches and monasteries. One late charter, from 1100, refers to the re-colonisation of some Alpine areas under Isarn's direction. Isarn's efforts at re-colonisation are not well evidenced in contemporary charters. Only one, from 976, shows the bishop granting a small piece of land as a medium plantum. Elsewhere in a charter, but with no specifics, we are told that Isarn granted castles and land to nobiles, mediores et pauperes: noblemen, the middle class, and the poor. One method used to put uncultivated soil back into use was probably also used to resettle wasteland. A person could be charged with replanting a large tract of land or rebuilding a set of houses in return for his owning a precarium or usufruct on half of them for his lifetime.In a charter of 970 from the Abbey of Sauxillanges, one Gausbert, a plantario, agreed to rebuild the houses destroyed by fire in the village of Brioude in return for either a precarium for life or the usufruct of one half of the houses (Lewis, 281). This method of resettlement and redefence led to castles which were half owned by the bishop and half by those who occupied them. In an eleventh-century dispute between Hugh of Ch√¢teauneuf and Guigues III of Albon over the possession of ecclesiastic lands in the Gravaisdun, Hugh, to reinforce what he judged to be his right, fabricated a story of Isarn reconquering by arms the diocese of Grenoble from the hands of the Saracens. That was the object of the preamble to a series of documents designed to establish the right of the diocese over those lands, documents known as the \\"Cartularies of Saint Hugh\\".For the pertinent text, in both Latin and English, see Versteegh, 376.

This mainly relates to when to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment. Nanotechnology refers to an increasing number of commercially available products ‚Äì from socks and trousers to tennis racquets and cleaning cloths. Such nanotechnologies and their accompanying industries have triggered calls for increased community participation and effective regulatory arrangements. However, these calls have presently not led to such comprehensive regulation to oversee research and the commercial application of nanotechnologies, or any comprehensive labeling for products that contain nanoparticles or are derived from nano-processes. Regulatory bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling. Managing risks: human and environmental health and safety Studies of the health impact of airborne particles generally shown that for toxic materials, smaller particles are more toxic. This is due in part to the fact that, given the same mass per volume, the dose in terms of particle numbers increases as particle size decreases. Based upon available data, it has been argued that current risk assessment methodologies are not suited to the hazards associated with nanoparticles; in particular, existing toxicological and eco-toxicological methods are not up to the task; exposure evaluation (dose) needs to be expressed as quantity of nanoparticles and/or surface area rather than simply mass; equipment for routine detecting and measuring nanoparticles in air, water, or soil is inadequate; and very little is known about the physiological responses to nanoparticles. Regulatory bodies in the U.S. as well as in the EU have concluded that nanoparticles form the potential for an entirely new risk and that it is necessary to carry out an extensive analysis of the risk. The challenge for regulators is whether a matrix can be developed which would identify nanoparticles and more complex nanoformulations which are likely to have special toxicological properties or whether it is more reasonable for each particle or formulation to be tested separately. The International Council on Nanotechnology maintains a database and Virtual Journal of scientific papers on environmental, health and safety research on nanoparticles.Virtual Journal of Nanotechnology Environment, Health and Safety The database currently has over 2000 entries indexed by particle type, exposure pathway and other criteria. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) currently lists 807 products that manufacturers have voluntarily identified that use nanotechnology. No labeling is required by the FDA so that number could be significantly higher. \\"The use of nanotechnology in consumer products and industrial applications is growing rapidly, with the products listed in the PEN inventory showing just the tip of the iceberg\\" according to PEN Project Director David Rejeski . A list of those products that have been voluntarily disclosed by their manufacturers is located here . The Material Safety Data Sheet that must be issued for certain materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only. Democratic governance Many argue that government has a responsibility to provide opportunities for the public to be involved in the development of new forms of science and technology. Community engagement can be achieved through various means or mechanisms. An online journal article identifies traditional approaches such as referenda, consultation documents, and advisory committees that include community members and other stakeholders. Other conventional approaches include public meetings and \\"closed\\" dialog with stakeholders. More contemporary engagement processes that have been employed to include community members in decisions about nanotechnology include citizens' juries and consensus conferences. Leach and Scoones (2006, p. 45) argue that since that ‚Äúmost debates about science and technology options involve uncertainty, and often ignorance, public debate about regulatory regimes is essential.‚Äù It has been argued that limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology,Faunce TA. Toxicological and public good considerations for the regulation of nanomaterial-containing medical productsExpert Opin. Drug Saf. (2008) 7(2):103-106. and that the development of comprehensive regulation of nanotechnology will be vital to ensure that the potential risks associated with the research and commercial application of nanotechnology do not overshadow its potential benefits. Regulation may also be required to meet community expectations about responsible development of nanotechnology, as well as ensuring that public interests are included in shaping the development of nanotechnology. Community education, engagement and consultation tend to occur \\"downstream\\": once there is at least a moderate level of awareness, and often during the process of disseminating and adapting technologies. \\"Upstream\\" engagement, by contrast, occurs much earlier in the innovation cycle and involves: \\"dialogue and debate about future technology options and pathways, bringing the often expert-led approaches to horizon scanning, technology foresight and scenario planning to involve a wider range of perspectives and inputs.\\" Daniel Sarewitz Director of Arizona State University‚Äôs Consortium on Science, Policy and Outcomes, argues that \\"by the time new devices reach the stage of commercialization and regulation, it is usually too late to alter them to correct problems.\\" However, Xenos, et al. argue that upstream engagement can be utilized in this area through anticipated discussion with peers. Upstream engagement in this sense is meant to \\"create the best possible conditions for sound policy making and public judgments based on careful assessment of objective information\\". Discussion may act as a catalyst for upstream engagement by prompting accountability for individuals to seek and process additional information (\\"anticipatory elaboration\\"). However, though anticipated discussion did lead to participants seeking further information, Xenos et al. found that factual information was not primarily sought out; instead, individuals sought out opinion pieces and editorials. The stance that the research, development and use of nanotechnology should be subject to control by the public sector is sometimes referred to as nanosocialism. =Newness= The question of whether nanotechnology represents something 'new' must be answered to decide how best nanotechnology should be regulated. The Royal Society recommended that the UK government assess chemicals in the form of nanoparticles or nanotubes as new substances. Subsequent to this, in 2007 a coalition of over forty groups called for nanomaterials to be classified as new substances, and regulated as such. Despite these recommendations, chemicals comprising nanoparticles that have previously been subject to assessment and regulation may be exempt from regulation, regardless of the potential for different risks and impacts. In contrast, nanomaterials are often recognized as 'new' from the perspective of intellectual property rights (IPRs), and as such are commercially protected via patenting laws. There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) ‚Äì by \\"bolting on\\" nanotechnology to existing regulations ‚Äì there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively \\"slip through the cracks\\" without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency. Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and zinc oxide (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage in vitro, such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the stratum corneum of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the precautionary principle in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases.Faunce TA, Nasu H, Murray K, Bowman D. Sunscreen Safety: The Precautionary Principle, The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Nanoparticles in SunscreensNanoethics (2008) 2:231‚Äì240 DOI 10.1007/s11569-008-0041-z Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed prepainted steel roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen.Barker PJ and Branch A. The interaction of modern sunscreen formulations with surface coatings. Progress in Organic Coatings 2008; 62: 313-320 Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies. Nanomedicines are just beginning to enter drug regulatory processes, but within a few decades could comprise a dominant group within the class of innovative pharmaceuticals, the current thinking of government safety and cost-effectiveness regulators appearing to be that these products give rise to few if any nano-specific issues.Vines T and Faunce TA Assessing the safety and cost-effectiveness of early nanodrugs Journal of Law and Medicine 2007; 16: 822-845 Some academics (such as Thomas Alured Faunce) have challenged that proposition and suggest that nanomedicines may create unique or heightened policy challenges for government systems of cost-effectiveness as well as safety regulation.Faunce TA Policy challenges of nanomedicine for Australia‚Äôs PBS. Australian Health Review 2009; 33 (2): 258-267 There are also significant public good aspects to the regulation of nanotechnology, particularly with regard to ensuring that industry involvement in standard- setting does not become a means of reducing competition and that nanotechnology policy and regulation encourages new models of safe drug discovery and development more systematically targeted at the global burden of disease.Faunce TA Toxicological and public good considerations for the regulation of nanomaterial-containing medical products. Expert Opinion in Drug Safety (2008) 7(2):103-106Faunce TA, White JW, Matthaei KI. Integrated Research into the Nanoparticle-protein Corona: A New Focus for Safe, Sustainable and Equitable Development of Nanomedicines Nanomedicine 2008;(6): 859-66 Self-regulation attempts may well fail, due to the inherent conflict of interest in asking any organization to police itself. If the public becomes aware of this failure, an external, independent organization is often given the duty of policing them, sometimes with highly punitive measures taken against the organization. The Food and Drug Administration notes that it only regulates on the basis of voluntary claims made by the product manufacturer. If no claims are made by a manufacturer, then the FDA may be unaware of nanotechnology being employed. Yet regulations worldwide still fail to distinguish between materials in their nanoscale and bulk form. This means that nanomaterials remain effectively unregulated; there is no regulatory requirement for nanomaterials to face new health and safety testing or environmental impact assessment prior to their use in commercial products, if these materials have already been approved in bulk form. The health risks of nanomaterials are of particular concern for workers who may face occupational exposure to nanomaterials at higher levels, and on a more routine basis, than the general public. = International law= There is no international regulation of nanoproducts or the underlying nanotechnology. Nor are there any internationally agreed definitions or terminology for nanotechnology, no internationally agreed protocols for toxicity testing of nanoparticles, and no standardized protocols for evaluating the environmental impacts of nanoparticles. Moreover, nanomaterials do not fall within the scope of existing international treaties regulating toxic chemicals. Since products that are produced using nanotechnologies will likely enter international trade, it is argued that it will be necessary to harmonize nanotechnology standards across national borders. There is concern that some countries, most notably developing countries, will be excluded from international standards negotiations. The Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards notes that ‚Äúdeveloping countries should have a say in international nanotechnology standards development, even if they lack capacity to enforce the standards\\". (p. 14). Concerns about monopolies and concentrated control and ownership of new nanotechnologies were raised in community workshops in Australia in 2004. Arguments against regulation Wide use of the term nanotechnology in recent years has created the impression that regulatory frameworks are suddenly having to contend with entirely new challenges that they are unequipped to deal with. Many regulatory systems around the world already assess new substances or products for safety on a case by case basis, before they are permitted on the market. These regulatory systems have been assessing the safety of nanometre scale molecular arrangements for many years and many substances comprising nanometre scale particles have been in use for decades e.g. Carbon black, Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, Bentonite, Aluminum silicate, Iron oxides, Silicon dioxide, Diatomaceous earth, Kaolin, Talc, Montmorillonite, Magnesium oxide, Copper sulphate. These existing approval frameworks almost universally use the best available science to assess safety and do not approve substances or products with an unacceptable risk benefit profile. One proposal is to simply treat particle size as one of the several parameters defining a substance to be approved, rather than creating special rules for all particles of a given size regardless of type. A major argument against special regulation of nanotechnology is that the projected applications with the greatest impact are far in the future, and it is unclear how to regulate technologies whose feasibility is speculative at this point. In the meantime, it has been argued that the immediate applications of nanomaterials raise challenges not much different from those of introducing any other new material, and can be dealt with by minor tweaks to existing regulatory schemes rather than sweeping regulation of entire scientific fields.Kevin Rollins, Nanobiotechnology Regulation: A Proposal for Self- Regulation with Limited Oversight, 6 NANOTECHNOLOGY L. & BUS. 221, 221 (2009). A truly precautionary approach to regulation could severely impede development in the field of nanotechnology safety studies are required for each and every nanoscience application. While the outcome of these studies can form the basis for government and international regulations, a more reasonable approach might be development of a risk matrix that identifies likely culprits.  Response from governments  United Kingdom = In its seminal 2004 report Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies: Opportunities and Uncertainties, the United Kingdom's Royal Society concluded that: :Many nanotechnologies pose no new risks to health and almost all the concerns relate to the potential impacts of deliberately manufactured nanoparticles and nanotubes that are free rather than fixed to or within a material... We expect the likelihood of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released from products in which they have been fixed or embedded (such as composites) to be low but have recommended that manufacturers assess this potential exposure risk for the lifecycle of the product and make their findings available to the relevant regulatory bodies... It is very unlikely that new manufactured nanoparticles could be introduced into humans in doses sufficient to cause the health effects that have been associated with [normal air pollution]. but have recommended that nanomaterials be regulated as new chemicals, that research laboratories and factories treat nanomaterials \\"as if they were hazardous\\", that release of nanomaterials into the environment be avoided as far as possible, and that products containing nanomaterials be subject to new safety testing requirements prior to their commercial release. The 2004 report by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineers noted that existing UK regulations did not require additional testing when existing substances were produced in nanoparticulate form. The Royal Society recommended that such regulations were revised so that ‚Äúchemicals produced in the form of nanoparticles and nanotubes be treated as new chemicals under these regulatory frameworks‚Äù (p.xi). They also recommended that existing regulation be modified on a precautionary basis because they expect that ‚Äúthe toxicity of chemicals in the form of free nanoparticles and nanotubes cannot be predicted from their toxicity in a larger form and... in some cases they will be more toxic than the same mass of the same chemical in larger form.‚Äù The Better Regulation Commission's earlier 2003 report had recommended that the UK Government: # enable, through an informed debate, the public to consider the risks for themselves, and help them to make their own decisions by providing suitable information; # be open about how it makes decisions, and acknowledge where there are uncertainties; # communicate with, and involve as far as possible, the public in the decision making process; # ensure it develops two-way communication channels; and # take a strong lead over the handling of any risk issues, particularly information provision and policy implementation. These recommendations were accepted in principle by the UK Government. Noting that there was ‚Äúno obvious focus for an informed public debate of the type suggested by the Task Force‚Äù, the UK government's response was to accept the recommendations. The Royal Society's 2004 report identified two distinct governance issues: # the ‚Äúrole and behaviour of institutions‚Äù and their ability to ‚Äúminimise unintended consequences‚Äù through adequate regulation and # the extent to which the public can trust and play a role in determining the trajectories that nanotechnologies may follow as they develop. = United States = Rather than adopt a new nano-specific regulatory framework, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convenes an 'interest group' each quarter with representatives of FDA centers that have responsibility for assessment and regulation of different substances and products. This interest group ensures coordination and communication. A September 2009 FDA document called for identifying sources of nanomaterials, how they move in the environment, the problems they might cause for people, animals and plants, and how these problems could be avoided or mitigated. The Bush administration in 2007 decided that no special regulations or labeling of nanoparticles were required. Critics derided this as treating consumers like a \\"guinea pig\\" without sufficient notice due to lack of labelling. Berkeley, CA is currently the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology. Cambridge, MA in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but the committee it instituted to study the issue Cambridge recommended against regulation in its final report, recommending instead other steps to facilitate information-gathering about potential effects of nanomaterials. On December 10, 2008 the U.S. National Research Council released a report calling for more regulation of nanotechnology.United States National Research Council. (2008). Review of Federal Strategy for Nanotechnology-Related Environmental, Health, and Safety Research. National Academies Press. California Assembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006) authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) within the California Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to request information on environmental and health impacts from chemical manufacturers and importers, including testing techniques. =California= In October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the California Environmental Protection Agency, announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes. DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. These sections were added as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006). They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals. On January 22, 2009, a formal information request letter was sent to manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State. This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January 22, 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in. The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on November 16, 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California. DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit their website for the latest up-to-date information at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm. On December 21, 2010, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) initiated the second Chemical Information Call-in for six nanomaterials: nano cerium oxide, nano silver, nano titanium dioxide, nano zero valent iron, nano zinc oxide, and quantum dots. DTSC sent a formal information request letter to forty manufacturers who produce or import the six nanomaterials in California, or who may export them into the State. The Chemical Information Call-in is meant to identify information gaps of these six nanomaterials and to develop further knowledge of their analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information under California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. DTSC completed the carbon nanotube information call-in in June 2010. DTSC partners with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Riverside (UCR), University of Southern California (USC), Stanford University, Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEIN), and The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on safe nanomaterial handling practices. DTSC is interested in expanding the Chemical Information Call-in to members of the brominated flame retardants, members of the methyl siloxanes, ocean plastics, nano-clay, and other emerging chemicals. = European Union = The European Union has formed a group to study the implications of nanotechnology called the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks which has published a list of risks associated with nanoparticles.http://ec.europa.eu/health/opinions2/en/nanotechnologies/l-2/6-health- effects-nanoparticles.htm#0 Consequently, manufacturers and importers of carbon products, including carbon nano-tubes will have to submit full health and safety data within a year or so in order to comply with REACH. A number of European member states have called for the creation of either national or European nanomaterials registries. France, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have established national registries of nanomaterials. In Addition, the European Commission requested the Europeach Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to create a European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON) that aims at collecting publicly available information on the safety and markets of nanomaterials and nanotechnology.  Response from advocacy groups  In January 2008, a coalition of over 40 civil society groups endorsed a statement of principles calling for precautionary action related to nanotechnology. The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the International Center for Technology Assessment's report Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano materials, which states: :Hundreds of consumer products incorporating nano-materials are now on the market, including cosmetics, sunscreens, sporting goods, clothing, electronics, baby and infant products, and food and food packaging. But evidence indicates that current nano-materials may pose significant health, safety, and environmental hazards. In addition, the profound social, economic, and ethical challenges posed by nano-scale technologies have yet to be addressed ... 'Since there is currently no government oversight and no labeling requirements for nano-products anywhere in the world, no one knows when they are exposed to potential nano-tech risks and no one is monitoring for potential health or environmental harm. That's why we believe oversight action based on our principles is urgent' ... This industrial boom is creating a growing nano-workforce which is predicted to reach two million globally by 2015. 'Even though potential health hazards stemming from exposure have been clearly identified, there are no mandatory workplace measures that require exposures to be assessed, workers to be trained, or control measures to be implemented,' explained Bill Kojola of the AFL-CIO. 'This technology should not be rushed to market until these failings are corrected and workers assured of their safety'\\" also . The group has urged action based on eight principles. They are (1) A Precautionary Foundation (2) Mandatory Nano-specific Regulations (3) Health and Safety of the Public and Workers (4) Environmental Protection (5) Transparency (6) Public Participation (7) Inclusion of Broader Impacts and (8) Manufacturer Liability. Some NGOs, including Friends of the Earth, are calling for the formation of a separate nanotechnology specific regulatory framework for the regulation of nanotechnology. In Australia, Friends of the Earth propose the establishment of a Nanotechnology Regulatory Coordination Agency, overseen by a Foresight and Technology Assessment Board. The advantage of this arrangement is that it could ensure a centralized body of experts that are able to provide oversight across the range of nano- products and sectors. It is also argued that a centralized regulatory approach would simplify the regulatory environment, thereby supporting industry innovation. A National Nanotechnology Regulator could coordinate existing regulations related to nanotechnology (including intellectual property, civil liberties, product safety, occupation health and safety, environmental and international law). Regulatory mechanisms could vary from \\"hard law at one extreme through licensing and codes of practice to 'soft' self-regulation and negotiation in order to influence behavior.\\" The formation of national nanotechnology regulatory bodies may also assist in establishing global regulatory frameworks. In early 2008, The UK's largest organic certifier, the Soil Association, announced that its organic standard would exclude nanotechnology, recognizing the associated human and environmental health and safety risks. Certified organic standards in Australia exclude engineered nanoparticles.Paul, John Nanotechnology: No Free Lunch, Platter, 1(1) 8-17 It appears likely that other organic certifiers will also follow suit.Paul, John & Lyons, Kristen (2008) , Nanotechnology: The Next Challenge for Organics, Journal of Organic Systems, 3(1) 3-22 The Soil Association was also the first to declare organic standards free from genetic engineering. Technical aspectsSize= Regulation of nanotechnology will require a definition of the size, in which particles and processes are recognized as operating at the nano-scale. The size-defining characteristic of nanotechnology is the subject of significant debate, and varies to include particles and materials in the scale of at least 100 to 300 nanometers (nm). Friends of the Earth Australia recommend defining nano-particles up to 300 nanometers (nm) in size. They argue that \\"particles up to a few hundred nanometers in size share many of the novel biological behaviors of nano-particles, including novel toxicity risks\\", and that \\"nano-materials up to approximately 300 nm in size can be taken up by individual cells\\". The UK Soil Association define nanotechnology to include manufactured nano-particles where the mean particle size is 200 nm or smaller. The U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative defines nanotechnology as ‚Äúthe understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nm. =Mass thresholds= Regulatory frameworks for chemicals tend to be triggered by mass thresholds. This is certainly the case for the management of toxic chemicals in Australia through the National pollutant inventory. However, in the case of nanotechnology, nano-particle applications are unlikely to exceed these thresholds (tonnes/kilograms) due to the size and weight of nano- particles. As such, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars questions the usefulness of regulating nanotechnologies on the basis of their size/weight alone. They argue, for example, that the toxicity of nano- participles is more related to surface area than weight, and that emerging regulations should also take account of such factors.

It was located on the northern edges of the town and its 7 km lap passed under a railway line viaduct, crossed the South Esk River via the wooden Kings Bridge, turned hard right at the doorstep of the Longford Hotel, passed over the railway line using a level crossing and traversed the South Esk again via another wooden structure, the Long Bridge. History Its first race meeting was held in 1953, the Australian Grand Prix was staged there in 1959 and 1965 and the track hosted a round of the Tasman Series each year from 1964 to 1968. It was also the venue for the single race 1962 Australian Touring Car Championship (at 7.242 km (4.501 mi), Longford is the longest circuit ever used in the ATCC), the Australian Tourist Trophy in 1960, 1964 & 1966 and a round of the Australian Drivers' Championship each year from 1958 to 1965. Its use as a motor racing venue was curtailed due to financial issues, following the running of the 1968 Tasman Series meeting. Drivers Drivers who raced at Longford read as a \\"who's who\\" of 1960s Grand Prix racing. The list includes World Champions Jack Brabham, Jim Clark, Graham Hill, Phil Hill, Denny Hulme and Jackie Stewart, as well as Bruce McLaren and Chris Amon. Australian open wheel and touring car stars Bib Stillwell, Lex Davison, Leo Geoghegan, Frank Matich, Frank Gardner, Spencer Martin, Kevin Bartlett, John Harvey, Ian Geoghegan, Norm Beechey, Bob Jane and Allan Moffat also raced at the circuit. Tasmanian (John Youl) was among the leading drivers in Australia during the 1960 period. Lap Record The new outright lap record of 2:12.6 set by New Zealand‚Äôs Chris Amon in a Ferrari P4 sports car at the final meeting was, with an average lap speed of 122.2 mph (196.62 km/h), the fastest lap record for any Australian motor racing circuit and would remain so until the opening of the new Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne in 1987, though unlike Longford which is a road circuit, the Thunderdome is a high-banked (24¬∞ in the turns) quad-oval speedway. Longford would continue as Australia's fastest road racing circuit until the Formula One series moved to the new Albert Park Grand Prix Circuit in Melbourne in 1996. Present day The remains of the Viaduct corner where the circuit crossed underneath a railway There is little left of the original track as the two bridges have long been demolished and a highway now intersects the network of roads on which the circuit was laid out. Motor sport returned to Longford in 2011 with the first running of the Longford Revival Festival which takes place on Pateena Road (The Flying Mile). There drivers get to run their cars, both road cars and historic race cars, down The Flying Mile.

Matilda 1814  These tensions still existed in 1814 when six lascars (Indian seamen) from Matilda, absconded from her in a long boat near Fiordland. Possibly near Dusky Sound three of them were killed and the other three were taken prisoner. Matilda went on to Stewart Island and from there sent Robert Brown in an open boat to look for the missing men. He came up the east coast and touched at Cape Saunders before going on up the coast to a point some eight miles north of Moeraki. There he and his seven companions hauled the boat ashore and went to sleep under it, but were seen by MƒÅori and attacked and all but two were killed. The two survivors fled through the night to what is now known as Bobby's Head near the Pleasant Valley. MƒÅori initially entertained the survivors, but upon discussion with later arriving MƒÅori who had participated in the attack, killed the two survivors as well. Meanwhile, Fowler brought Matilda into Otago Harbour, the site of the 1810 incident. Here they received a friendly reception from the MƒÅori and Fowler later used this to attempt a correction of the common conception that the MƒÅori were hostile to Europeans.The Creed manuscript, cited above; also Peter Entwisle, Taka: a Vignette Life of William Tucker, 1784‚Äì1817, Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, pp. 84‚Äì87 and Samuel Fowler, in the Sydney Gazette2 December 1815 p.2b-c.  Sophia and the burning of ≈åtƒÅkou 1817  Part of the modern village of Otakou, Otago Harbour. In 1815 William Tucker, who had been in the Otago Harbour area as early as 1809, landed again and settled at Whareakeake (later called Murdering Beach). There he kept goats and sheep, had a MƒÅori wife, built a house, and apparently set up an export trade in ornamental ‚Äì neck pendants made from old adzes. He left but returned on Sophia, a Hobart sealer commanded by James Kelly, apparently with other Europeans meaning to settle. Sophia anchored in Otago Harbour in 1817 and Tucker was well-received. Two or three days later Kelly went to visit Whareakeake in an open boat, with Tucker and five others, having been persuaded by Tucker not to take their firearms. At Whareakeake they had a friendly reception and encountered one of the Matildas lascars who told them of his countrymen's fate. It seems Tucker had gone into his house but Kelly was attacked, at the instigation of the Whareakeake chief Te Matahaere. In the ensuing melee Veto Viole, John Griffiths, and William Tucker were killed (Griffiths was Kelly's brother-in- law). Escaping by longboat, Kelly and the other survivors returned to Sophia in Otago Harbour. According to their own report, they found her boarded by more MƒÅori; they regained control of the vessel after a bloody fight, during which the MƒÅori chief, Korako, was captured, and later shot when he attempted to escape. Historians caution that Kelly's account of events, made to justify the actions he took, exaggerates the danger he and his men were in. It is certain that they killed many MƒÅori, including Korako, at that time. Kelly then proceeded to destroy multiple canoes and set fire to \\"the beautiful city of Otago\\". This probably refers to ≈åtƒÅkou, on the other side of the harbour; however, the Whareakeake village does seem to have been burned at around the same time, and abandoned rather than rebuilt.The Creed mansucript cited above; Peter Entwisle, Taka: A Vignette Life of William Tucker 1784‚Äì1817, Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 2005, pp. 88‚Äì97; James Kelly in Hobart Town Courier, 12 April 1858. A was placed on the site and lifted in the 1860s. The motive for the attack at Whareakeake is unclear. Kelly believed it was a reprisal for previous shootings of MƒÅori by Europeans. Another account accused Tucker of having stolen a MƒÅori preserved head in 1811 and inaugurated the trade in these items; this is considered to be poorly evidenced. Local MƒÅori tradition has it that the trouble arose over the Sophias crew's treatment of the women at ≈åtƒÅkou.  General Gates and peace 1821  These hostilities and the diminution of seal populations, saw a decline in sealing ventures to southern New Zealand. It seems this was unknown to Captain Abimeleck Riggs of the American sealer General Gates, who in late 1819 landed a gang at Stewart Island. He had a troubled cruise and it wasn't until 1821 that he returned. He then dropped a second gang and then a third at Taiari / Chalky Inlet. MƒÅori attacked the second gang in October 1821. Six of his men were captured, taken north up the west coast, where eventually four were killed. Meanwhile, the MƒÅori killed a boy that the gang at Chalky left to look after their stores. The MƒÅori pursued the rest of the gang and killed two members before the survivors came across Captain Edwardson of Snapper in Chalky Inlet. The pursuing MƒÅori were led by 'Te Pehi', 'Topi' and 'Te Whera'. Also with the pursuers was James Caddell, who, was originally captured from Sydney Cove, had acculturated himself to MƒÅori society. Edwardson now took Caddell to Sydney, where his arrival caused a sensation in 1823 and where a peace was brokered. Thereafter, sealing resumed although it soon petered out again because the animal populations had been severely depleted.

History  Literature = From the mid 19th century, the word was used with the meaning 'way through life' or 'way of life'. It appears, for example, in literary contexts in the stories of Clara Lee and Rose Porter, in the verse of Frank L. Stanton, and in editor and politician Edgar Howard's opinion pieces on other political figures. = Anthropology and archeology = Dr Arthur C. Parker, American archaeologist of Seneca and Scots-English descent, was one of the earliest to use the term in reference to Native American ways of life, saying in an article published by the Binghamton Press in 1930, \\"Our key to the future is locked in the life-ways of our Indian predecessors\\". Use of the term in anthropology was established with the publication of Morris Edward Opler's 1941 study An Apache Life-Way: The Economic, Social, and Religious Institutions of the Chiricahua Indians. Recent explanations of the term in the field of Native American and other Indigenous studies \\"suggest the close interaction of worldview and economy in small-scale societies\\".

Yoriyoshi's decision had profound consequences for the country, because, since Hachiman was the Minamoto's tutelary kami, Kamakura was now the land of his family's ancestors.Kusumoto (2002:18-19) This, together with the fact Kamakura is a natural fortress and his desire to leave Kyoto, convinced Yoritomo this was the right place to found his shogunate. As a consequence, Kamakura became the unofficial capital of Japan. It is unclear when the shrine's official name was changed into Yui Wakamiya.

Bartolotti was probably born in Bologna, Italy, as he describes himself as \\"Bolognese\\" on the title page of his first guitar book and \\"di Bologna\\" on the title page of his second. Career Bartolotti's early career was probably spent in Florence, possibly in the service of Jacopo Salviati, Duke of Giuliano. He was amongst a group of Italian musicians invited to the Court of Queen Christina of Sweden in the early 1650s. There are records of his employment there in 1652 and 1654. On her abdication in 1655, Christina lived in Rome and Bartolotti was probably employed in her service there. In 1658, she travelled to Paris, and it is possible that Bartolotti accompanied her. He seems to have settled there and lived there until his death sometime before 1682. Works During his years in Italy, Bartolotti published at least two collections of guitar music: Libro primo di chitarra spagnola (Florence, 1640) and Secondo libro di chitarra (Rome, ca. 1655). The first book contains a cycle of passacaglias in all major and minor keys, employing a combination of battute and pizzicato styles, influenced by earlier Italian guitarists such as Giovanni Paolo Foscarini; the book also includes a ciaccona, a follia and six suites each comprising an Allemanda, Corente and Sarabanda. The second book is French-influenced, with more emphasis on pizzicato writing. Three more pieces are attributed to him in manuscripts. Bartolotti's oeuvre comprises some of the most carefully notated (with precise indications for various playing styles, ornaments, etc.) and advanced guitar music of the period. In France, however, he was best known as a theorbo player, praised by Constantijn Huygens and Ren√© Ouvrard. His treatise on theorbo accompaniment (Table pour apprendre facilement √† toucher le th√©orbe sur la basse-continu√´ (Paris, 1669) is among the best 17th-century sources on the subject.

The film's scenario was written by Clifford Howard, art direction was by Edward Langley, and choreography was by Geneva Driscoll. The film is notable for its nude scenes, which caused it to be banned and preached against in some towns. Plot Following a prologue introducing Munson, poet Thorton Darcy (De Brulier) was writing an allegorical poem, which the film enacts with Munson portraying Virtue who meets beings such as the Muses and Evil (Carroll). Darcy takes a nap and meets Purity (Munson), a simple country girl, who seems like the Virtue of his poem, which they read together. Thorton tries to publish his poems, but the Publisher (Burton) wants $500 in advance for the printing, which Thorton lacks. He tells Purity he would marry her if not for his finances. Purity goes to where they met and undresses to bath in a stream, where artist Claude Lamarque (Hollingsworth) draws her, and after she finishes and dresses he approaches her and suggests she pose for him for an allegorical painting. When Thorton falls ill, she goes to the artist's studio and poses nude for Claude, receiving funds that she gives to the publisher. Judith Lure (Forde) meets Purity and hires her to perform at a party, and Purity recreates some statues (for which Munson had posed). Purity has Thorton's book published and it is successful. Thorton toes to the studio where Luston Black (Carroll) attempting to seduce Purity, and Thorton defends her until Luston reveals that Purity has posed in the nude. Thorton abandons her until Claude tells him that Purity did it for his account, whereupon Thorton seeks forgiveness and is reunited with Purity. Cast Munson in a damaged still. Production Purity was produced by the American Film Company (known as the \\"Flying \\"A\\" Studios\\") based in Santa Barbara, California. The film was shot on the estate of Francis Townsend Underhill in Santa Barbara and was distributed by Mutual Film. Censorship The National Board of Review (NBR) had been established by members of the film industry in 1909 in an attempt to preempt state and local censorship of films. As a result of Munson's first film, Inspiration (1915), the NBR in February 2016 revised its policy on depictions of nudity to require a critical review to pass films only when it \\"an essential element of a drama the nature of which warrants such presentation.\\" Purity was submitted to the NBR in July 1916 and it held two screenings before a select group of invitees and obtained their disparate views of the film. As a result, the NBR neither passed nor rejected the film, instead issuing a list of 10 recommended deletions with a note that local censors should consider their community standards and public opinion. The deletions included scenes in the prologue where the neckline of Munson's gown was too low, scenes with suggestive expressions on the faces of men, a word on an intertitle, a shot of a nude painting in the artist's studio, all shots of Munson changing clothes at the stream and in the studio, all shots of Munson posing as reproductions of masterpieces at the party, and any shot of Munson moving while nude, while scenes of Munson posing nude at the studio should be reduced to one or two short flashes. Not all local state and municipal film censors followed the NBR recommendations. Purity was banned in the state of Kansas and in cities including Dallas, Kansas City, Missouri, Jackson, Mississippi, and Washington, D.C., while the recommended NBR cuts were followed in Denver, Seattle, Spokane, and Takoma. Other locations either selected their own eliminations or showed the film uncut. Following this experience with Purity, the NBR announced a policy of not passing any film with nudity. Innocence Advertisement for the film Innocence. Isolated newspaper advertisements of 1921 and 1922 describe another Munson film called Innocence. It was during a showing of Innocence combined with a personal onstage appearance by Munson that caused her arrest in St. Louis on October 3, 1921 at the Royal Theater (later the Towne Theater) on an indecency charge. Her manager was also arrested. Both were acquitted and were still appearing in St. Louis weeks later, enacting \\"a series of new poses from famous paintings\\". Innocence was also shown in Duluth, Minnesota, in March 1922. Here, too, Munson was to appear personally at the New Grand theater to \\"present a number of poses\\", promised at every performance. The description of the film in a blurb in the Duluth Herald details that, \\"In one scene more than 150 girls dance in a woodland dell, garbed in flying diaphanous draperies. Miss Geneva Driscoll, formerly of the Ruth St. Denis troupe, trained them.\\" That scenic description, and Geneva Driscoll's involvement, is entirely consistent with 1916 descriptions of the production of Purity. The idea that the film shown in 1921 as Innocence represents a repackaged version of 1916's Purity is also supported by the relationship between the publicist-and-journalist working for Purity's distributor Mutual Films, and Munson's independent manager for these later personal appearances. They were brothers. Credited as a columnist, Maxson F. Judell wrote promotional copy for local newspapers (\\"Audrey Munson... in The All-Together...\\"). Maxson's brother Benjamin Judell was Munson's manager arrested in St. Louis. In later years Ben Judell became the founder of the Hollywood poverty row studio Producers Releasing Corporation. Preservation Purity was long presumed to be a lost film. However, in 2004, a copy with French intertitles was rediscovered in a private collection in France. As the print had been intended for distribution in France, it lacks any of the cuts recommended by the NBR. A copy of the film is now preserved at the Centre national de la cin√©matographie in Paris. This is the only Munson film still extant.

Pershing. The raid and its response, set during World War I, the Mexican Revolution, and an accompanying low-level Border War, played a significant role in diplomacy and military preparedness for eventual American entry in the World War. The district encompasses buildings which survived the raid, and military facilities used in the American response. The landmark designation was made in 1975. and History On March 9, 1916, Camp Furlong was the headquarters of the 13th U.S. Cavalry under command of Colonel H. J. Slocum. The 13th Cavalry was stretched along the border on outpost duty from Noria to Hermanas on the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad. At least three troops were present during the raid on Columbus by Pancho Villa's irregulars. The hero of the day was Lt. Lucas of the machine gun troop, who while barefoot, set up machine guns in the main area of the town and directed heavy fire against the raiders. His actions inflicted numerous casualties on Villa's forces and caused them to retreat back into Mexico. Almost overnight, the camp became a large military installation for protection from other raids and in preparation for a punitive expedition into Mexico to be led by General John J. Pershing. First on the scene were elements of the New Mexico National Guard. Various regular units then arrived to provide support to the troops in Mexico. Columbus had the distinction of having the first tactical military airfield in the United States. The 1st Aero Squadron's Curtiss JN3 Jenny biplanes provided aerial observation and communications for the expedition, although most of the aircraft were lost to crashes in the rugged Mexican mountains. Camp Furlong also had supply facilities and repair yards for the early motor trucks used in Mexico. At its peak, the camp was headquarters for more than 5,000 troops. Following the withdrawal of the Punitive Expedition, the 24th Infantry Regiment was headquartered at the post. They were called in the summer of 1919 to assist in chasing Pancho Villas troops out of Ciudad Juarez. With the conclusion of the Mexican Revolution, the post lost its importance and only 100 men were garrisoned there in 1921. All troops in the area were gone by 1923. Historic district In Pancho Villa State Park, several buildings remain from the time of Villa's 1916 raid, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. These include the 1902 U.S. Customs House, two adobe structures dating from the Camp Furlong-era, and the Camp Furlong Recreation Hall. The old Customs House is now the State Park visitor center, with exhibits describing the histories of Pancho Villa, the Columbus raid of 1916, and Pershing's Punitive Expedition.Pancho Villa State Park The historic district also includes the former airfield, which is east of the state park, the former railroad station of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad (which now houses the local historical society museum), and the former Hoover Hotel, and adobe structure that was one of the only other buildings to survive.

It was built in 1891 to educate the children of a growing population of Irish American laborers, and was expanded in 1925. The building continued to be used as a school until 1972. The brick building on Mountain Lane, with a rear entrance on Taxter Road, has since been converted to a condominium, but remains the oldest standing school building in the area. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Building The two-story brick building sits on a dressed-rock foundation exposed at the rear. A thin stone course divides the two stories. The school's name appears in molded concrete above its main entrance, also surrounded with a concrete entablature. The windows use stone trim. The rear entrance has a brick, stone and concrete porch. The asphalt-shingled hipped roof has gabled, louvered dormers on the front and back and an off-center cupola. Inside, much of the building remained as it originally was when used as a school, at least at the time of its addition to the Register. It is heavy on wood, particularly oak, paneling and wainscoting. History As the nearby village of Irvington grew in the late 19th century, due to the completion of the Hudson River Railroad, it became home to a number of wealthy residents, who imitated the village's namesake, Washington Irving, by buying, building or expanding large houses along the river. This activity, and the maintenance of those houses, required a large labor force. Irish immigrants, already drawn to the area by jobs on the railroad, the docks and the building of the Croton Aqueduct, filled them. They settled in a previously rural area to the east of Irvington that quickly came to be known as \\"Little Dublin\\". Irvington had built its first public school in 1872 in the village, but that wasn't enough to handle the pupils from further inland. Accordingly, East Irvington School was built in 1891 as a single-story building, educating students from kindergarten to eighth grade, including some from the village. By 1925 continued population growth led to the addition of the second story. In the early 1950s, what was now the Irvington Union Free School District changed its grade structure to the district's primary school, educating all students from kindergarten to second grade, but by 1955 it was back to its original grades, but reverted again to limited grade use in 1960. The school was finally closed in 1972. The building stood vacant for a decade before being converted into a condominium in the 1980s. The former school yard is now East Irvington Park.

History A Faculty of Science was established as one of the first three faculties of the New South Wales University of Technology (later the University of New South Wales) at the university's Council meeting on 8 May 1950.https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A28-Science1.pdf Teaching in the subjects of applied chemistry and chemical engineering had, however, commenced the previous year. The present Faculty structure represents the outcome of two major and several minor UNSW restructures since 1997, with the primary aim of operational simplification and administrative efficiency. Before 1997 science teaching and research at UNSW was spread across three Faculties: Science; Biological & Behavioural Science;https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A32-FBioSci.pdf and Applied Science.https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A31-AppliedSci.pdf In 1997 the three Science faculties were disestablished and two new faculties were created - a Faculty of Science and Technology https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A142-SciTech.pdf and a Faculty of Life Sciences.https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A147-LifeSc.pdf In 2001, a second major restructure amalgamated most of the science schools resident in these two Faculties into a single new Faculty of Science.https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/A244-Science2.pdf A 2009 review of research in the Faculty resulted in the closure of the School of Risk & Safety Sciences in 2010. Within the School of Physics, the Centre for Quantum Computer Technology has three major research laboratories at the University of New South Wales: the Atomic Fabrication Facility (AFF), the National Magnet Laboratory (NML) and the Semiconductor Nanofabrication Facility (SNF). These all allow for nanoscale device fabrication and measurement. Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre Adjacent to the Chemical Sciences building, (Applied Science), is the new Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre (MWAC) designed by Francis-Jones Morehen Thorp,http://www.fjmt.com.au/projects/projects_unswcsb.html the goal of which is to co-locate major research instrumentation in a single, purpose built, high-grade facility for the University. The Analytical Centre houses the most important major instruments used in the Faculties of Science, Medicine and Engineering for the study of the structure and composition of biological, chemical and physical materials and also includes preparation laboratories, smaller instruments and computing facilities. In addition, it provides the technical/professional support for the instruments. The building also houses new teaching and research laboratories for the School of Chemistry. The Mark Wainwright Analytical Centre consolidates the management of resources to minimise unnecessary duplication, as well as providing the appropriate infrastructure to support the instruments and a world-class research environment within which the instrumentation can operate to specification. Additionally, the new Analytical Centre has recently received a $500,000 grant from the Magnowski Institute of Applied Science to use in further advances in the studies of applied science.

De Pe√±a had originally wanted to produce the film in Germany, but when he was unable to garner enough funds, he came to Luxembourg. The film was co- produced by Luxembourg Hemisphere Films and Polish Opus Film, and shot primarily in Luxembourg with the aid of numerous local technicians. As a result of the multifaceted production, the dialogue of the movie is in English, German and Polish. The plot of the story revolves around a girl called Mariola (Anna Cieslak:pl:Anna Cie≈õlak), who is forced into prostitution in Berlin, and attempts to hold on to her sense of self despite being exploited by those around her. The film was Luxembourg's submission to the 79th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Although previous submissions (such as Italy's Private) had been rejected due to not being in the official language of the country, the Academy removed the requirement for the 79th Academy Awards, allowing Your Name is Justine and other films such as Canada's Water (which contained only Hindi dialogue) to be submitted. However, the film was rejected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences before the formal review process. The Academy determined that there was not enough creative contribution from Luxembourg to qualify under the Academy's requirements, which stress that a \\"submitting country must certify that creative talent of that country exercised artistic control of the film.\\" Joy Hoffman, the head of Luxembourg's foreign-language Oscar committee, was disappointed by the rejection. Although he accepted the notion that the film was a \\"borderline entry\\", he noted that \\"without Luxembourg the film wouldn't exist\\".  Plot  While living with her grandmother in Poland, a young woman, Mariola (Anna Cieslak:pl:Anna Cie≈õlak) falls in love. Her boyfriend, Artur (Rafal Mackowiak) is charming and suggests they travel around Europe and work here and there to pay for their trip. Unfortunately, Artur isn't as he seems and Mariola is sold as a prostitute when they cross over to Germany. We follow her ordeal as she tries to free herself and to stay sane as time goes by and her captors try to break and condition her to a new life of servitude.

It was based on the play of the same name by Edward Poor Montgomery. A young woman maneuvers a lazy playboy into marrying her. This was one of several films, all produced by Merian C. Cooper at RKO, that were out of distribution for more than 50 years as a result of a legal settlement that gave Cooper complete ownership of the films. Turner Classic Movies eventually acquired the rights to the films. Plot When spoiled younger sister Valerie Colby (Lucile Browne) becomes engaged to be married to Dennis Moore (George Meeker), a more level-headed Joan (Ann Harding) decides to do the same, not because she is in love, but in order to make something of herself. She chooses unambitious, wealthy playboy John Fletcher (William Powell), who owns a struggling shipping line. She eventually spends the night in his apartment. To Joan's annoyance, she finds herself falling in love with him. When he shows no interest in marrying her, she forces the issue. She arranges for her father, Colonel Sam Colby (Henry Stephenson), to find them in a compromising position. John graciously agrees to do the honorable thing and marry her. However, on their honeymoon cruise, he lets her know that he expects her to grant him a divorce after a decent interval. They settle on six months. Joan prods her husband into taking an interest in his family business. To his surprise, he finds that he enjoys it. As the new Postmaster General (Wallis Clark) is a good friend of her father's, Joan invites him to dinner, hoping to land a government contract for John's company. Meanwhile, Valerie goes into debt due to her extravagant spending habits and borrows from her big sister over and over again. Joan gives Valerie all she can afford without touching John's money. Finally, she pawns a ring for half the $500 Valerie needs, but tells her that it is the last time. That same day, John finally realizes that he loves his wife. However, when he goes home, Valerie goes to John behind Joan's back and cons him into giving her a check. Joan finds out and tears up the check. In her anger, Valerie blurts out how Joan trapped John into marriage. Disillusioned, he turns to his former paramour, Mrs. Monica Page (Lilian Bond). Joan goes to Monica's apartment and confesses all, including the fact that she has fallen in love with him, to no avail. She then tries to salvage her dinner party. To her delight, John shows up and makes it clear that he believes and forgives her.

Cannon (July 25, 1855 ‚Äì November 4, 1891), was an American actor, comedian and singer. He is best known for working with Edward Harrigan in the late 19th century comedy team of Harrigan & Hart. He met Harrigan in 1870. The two became a fixture at the Theatre Comique in New York City by the mid-1870s performing in Harrigan's farcical sketches. The slight and short Hart usually portrayed the female roles in their comic sketches and plays. Their breakthrough hit was the 1873 song and sketch \\"The Mulligan Guard\\", a lampoon of an Irish neighborhood \\"militia\\" with music by David Braham. It became their signature piece, and they featured it in many of their slapstick skits and plays. The team's last Broadway performance was in May 1885. Hart's health and financial condition both deteriorated, and he died at the age of 36. Early life and career Hart was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and began his career in Boston. He met Harrigan in Chicago in 1870 and soon changed his name to Tony Hart. Harrigan and Hart went in 1871 to Boston, where they had their first big success at John Stetson's Howard Athenaeum.Cullen, p. 484 They then moved on to New York, where they first worked with Tony Pastor before beginning a long run at Josh Hart's Theatre Comique. By the mid-1870s they began moving from the variety show toward musical theatre. Harrigan's sketches on the Comique's crowded bill featured comic Irish, German and black characters drawn from everyday life on the streets of New York.

It became their signature piece, and they featured it in many of their slapstick skits and plays.\\"Tony Hart\\", Internet Accuracy Project, accessed October 1, 2014 In 1876, Harrigan took over the Comique himself, along with Hart and manager Martin Hanley. By 1878, with The Mulligan Guard Picnic, Harrigan & Hart settled down on Broadway and performed in seventeen of their shows over the next seven years.Kenrick, John. \\"Who's Who in Musicals: Hale- Harris\\", Musicals101.com Their most popular musical was the Mulligan Guard's Ball (1880). Though still broad and farcical, full of chaos and hilarity, these shows integrated music with a more literary story line, together with dance, and they began to resemble modern musical comedy. Harrigan wrote the stories and lyrics, and Braham wrote the music. The action of the plays took place in downtown Manhattan and concerned real-life problems, such as interracial tensions, political corruption, and gang violence, all mixed with broad, street-smart comedy, puns and ethnic dialects. Harrigan played the politically ambitious Irish saloon owner \\"Dan Mulligan\\", and Hart played the African-American washerwoman \\"Rebecca Allup\\" in blackface.Moody, p. ? Although the Theatre Comique was eventually shut down for financial reasons, Harrigan and Hart announced in 1881 that they would build a fresh and elegant \\"New Theatre Comique\\" several blocks further north on Broadway. The building they renovated was originally the home of the Church of the Messiah but had hosted many other theatres throughout the years.Kahn Jr., E. J. The Merry Partners: The Act and Stage of Harrigan and Hart. New York: Random House, Inc., 1955 However, this theatre was not to last; it burned to the ground in 1884.Greenleaf, pp. 375‚Äì76; and \\"New Theatre Comique\\", Internet Broadway Database After the theatre collapsed, so did the partnership. Harrigan's habit of hiring relatives soured his partnership with Hart. In May 1885, five months after the fire, Harrigan and Hart appeared on Broadway together for the last time. Later years Hart and his wife, Gertie Granville, went on to appear in other productions, but he never achieved the popularity that he had enjoyed with Harrigan. His medical problems stemming from paresis and syphilis also increased, as his financial condition worsened.Cullen, p. 487 His friends and fans mounted a benefit production, on March 22, 1888, to raise funds for his living expenses and medical treatment. He developed dementia and spent most of his last years in a state mental institution. He died in Worcester, Massachusetts, at the age of 36 from complications of paresis and advanced syphilis. He is buried in St. John's Cemetery in Worcester. Harrigan 'n Hart In 1985, a musical celebrating the rise of the partnership, Harrigan 'N Hart, opened on Broadway. The show has a book by Michael Stewart, lyrics by Peter Walker, and music by Max Showalter is based on the book The Merry Partners by Ely Jacques Kahn, Jr. and material found by Nedda Harrigan Logan.

Early life Equizabal, the daughter of poor Russian immigrants, grew up in New York City with a passion for dance. She attended ballet school in the city and received training in Spanish dance. At age 15, she began dancing professionally when she was hired at a Greenwich Village nightclub. With her father's help, she had her name legally changed to Chita Tashma. As her talent grew, she became the first American to work with Carmen Amaya, a renowned gypsy flamenco dancer. Touring with Amaya's company, she met her first husband (and dance partner), Antonio Triana. After arriving in California during the 1940s, the couple appeared in a number of Spanish-themed films (including The Gay Senorita, The Lady and the Monster and The Bridge of San Luis Rey). The couple divorced in the 1950s. She later went on to marry a Spanish nobleman, Luis Equizabal, who had left Spain during its civil war. They remained married until his death in Los Angeles in 1980. Career In 1955, Lola Montes founded her own dance company, \\"Lola Montes and Her Spanish Dancers\\". The company toured throughout the United States and Canada for over two decades. In 1974, the Lola Montes Foundation for Dances of Spain and the Americas was established. The foundation was focused around the preservation of Spanish dance through community and educational outreach. Throughout this entire period from 1955 until her last performance in 2000, Lola acted as tour manager, choreographer, teacher and wardrobe supervisor for her dancers. During her career, Ms. Montes received numerous civic awards. She was an active member of her community, as a long-time member of the National Endowment for the Arts and the California Arts Council, serving as a member of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee and acting as president of the Los Angeles Area Dance Alliance in 1985. Her legacy is carried on by her many students, most notably Oscar Nieto an award-winning flamenco dancer in Canada, who is producing a documentary on the life and career of Equizabal. Carolina Lugo made her professional debut with Lola's company at age 14 and toured with her for eight seasons. While with her company she performed with the Los Angeles Opera at the Los Angeles Greek Amphitheater and with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Symphony at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Carolina formed her own dance company, Carolina Lugo's y Carol√© Acuna's Ballet Flamenco in San Francisco in 1995. Carol√© is Carolina,s daughter. Lola donated many of her costumes that she had made for her company in Spain to Carolina. These costumes are still used in many of Carolina's productions of Spanish dance with symphonies and opera companies nationally and internationally as an homage to Ms. Montes and to continue preserving the totality of the dances, songs and music from Spain that Lola started in 1955.

They are stars that have evolved away from the main sequence, expanding and becoming more luminous. Yellow supergiants are smaller than red supergiants; naked eye examples include Polaris. Many of them are variable stars, mostly pulsating Cepheids such as Œ¥ Cephei itself. Spectrum Yellow supergiants generally have spectral types of F and G, although sometimes late A or early K stars are included. These spectral types are characterised by hydrogen lines that are very strong in class A, weakening through F and G until they are very weak or absent in class K. Calcium H and K lines are present in late A spectra, but stronger in class F, and strongest in class G, before weakening again in cooler stars. Lines of ionised metals are strong in class A, weaker in class F and G, and absent from cooler stars. In class G, neutral metal lines are also found, along with CH molecular bands. Supergiants are identified in the Yerkes spectral classification by luminosities classes Ia and Ib, with intermediates such as Iab and Ia/ab sometimes being used. These luminosity classes are assigned using spectral lines that are sensitive to luminosity. Historically, the Ca H and K line strengths have been used for yellow stars, as well as the strengths of various metal lines. The neutral oxygen lines, such as the 777.3 nm triplet, have also been used since they are extremely sensitive to luminosity across a wide range of spectral types. Modern atmospheric models can accurately match all the spectral line strengths and profiles to give a spectral classification, or even skip straight to the physical parameters of the star, but in practice luminosity classes are still usually assigned by comparison against standard stars. Some yellow supergiant spectral standard stars: * F0 Ib: Œ± Leporis * F2 Ib: 89 Herculis * F5 Ib: Œ± Persei * F8 Ia: Œ¥ Canis Majoris * G0 Ib: Œº Persei * G2 Ib: Œ± Aquarii * G5 Ib: 9 Pegasi * G8 Ib: Œµ Geminorum Properties The massive RSGC1 cluster contains 14 red supergiants and one yellow supergiant. Yellow supergiants have a relatively narrow range of temperatures corresponding to their spectral types, from about 4,000 K to 7,000 K. Their luminosities range from about upwards, with the most luminous stars exceeding . The high luminosities indicate that they are much larger than the sun, from about to . The masses of yellow supergiants vary greatly, from less than the sun for stars such as W Virginis to or more (e.g. V810 Centauri). Corresponding surface gravities (log(g) cgs) are around 1‚Äì2 for high-mass supergiants, but can be as low as 0 for low-mass supergiants. Yellow supergiants are rare stars, much less common than red supergiants and main sequence stars. In M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), 16 yellow supergiants are seen associated with evolution from class O stars, of which there are around 25,000 visible. Variability Light curve of Delta Cephei, a yellow supergiant classical Cepheid variable Many yellow supergiants are in a region of the HR diagram known as the instability strip because their temperatures and luminosities cause them to be dynamically unstable. Most yellow supergiants observed in the instability strip are Cepheid variables, named for Œ¥ Cephei, which pulsate with well-defined periods that are related to their luminosities. This means they can be used as standard candles for determining the distance of stars knowing only their period of variability. Cepheids with longer periods are cooler and more luminous. Two distinct types of Cepheid variable have been identified, which have different period-luminosity relationships: Classical Cepheid variables are young massive population I stars; type II Cepheids are older population II stars with low masses, including W Virginis variables, BL Herculis variables and RV Tauri variables. The Classical Cepheids are more luminous than the type II Cepheids with the same period. R Coronae Borealis variables are often yellow supergiants, but their variability is produced by a different mechanism from the Cepheids. At irregular intervals, they become obscured by dust condensation around the star and their brightness drops dramatically. Evolution Evolution of a star, showing a blue loop and post-AGB track across the yellow supergiant region Supergiants are stars that have evolved away from the main sequence after exhausting the hydrogen in their cores. Yellow supergiants are a heterogenous group of stars crossing the standard categories of stars in the HR diagram at various different stages of their evolution. Stars more massive than spend a few million years on the main sequence as class O and early B stars until the dense hydrogen in their cores becomes depleted. Then they expand and cool to become supergiants. They spend a few thousand years as a yellow supergiant while cooling, then spend one to four million years as a red supergiant, typically. Supergiants make up less than 1% of stars; though different proportions in the visible early eras of the universe. The relatively brief phases and concentration of matter explains the rarity of these stars. Some red supergiants undergo a blue loop, temporarily re-heating and becoming yellow or even blue supergiants before cooling again. Stellar models show that blue loops rely on particular chemical makeups and other assumptions, but they are most likely for stars of low red supergiant mass. While cooling for the first time or when performing a sufficiently extended blue loop, yellow supergiants will cross the instability strip and pulsate as Classical Cepheid variables with periods around ten days and longer. Intermediate mass stars leave the main sequence by cooling along the subgiant branch until they reach the red giant branch. Stars more massive than about have a sufficiently large helium core that it begins fusion before becoming degenerate. These stars will perform a blue loop. For masses between about and , the blue loop can extend to F and G spectral types at luminosities reaching . These stars may develop supergiant luminosity classes, especially if they are pulsating. When these stars cross the instability strip they will pulsate as short period Cepheids. Blue loops in these stars can last for around 10 million years, so this type of yellow supergiant is more common than the more luminous types. Stars with masses similar to the sun develop degenerate helium cores after they leave the main sequence and ascend to the tip of the red giant branch where they ignite helium in a flash. They then fuse core helium on the horizontal branch with luminosities too low to be considered supergiants. Stars leaving the blue half of the horizontal branch to be classified in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pass through the yellow classifications and will pulsate as BL Herculis variables. Such yellow stars may be given a supergiant luminosity class despite their low masses but assisted by luminous pulsation. In the AGB thermal pulses from the helium-fusing shell of stars may cause a blue loop across the instability strip. Such stars will pulsate as W Virginis variables and again may be classified as relatively low luminosity yellow supergiants. When the hydrogen-fusing shell of a low or intermediate mass star of the AGB nears its surface, the cool outer layers are rapidly lost, which causes the star to heat up, eventually becoming a white dwarf. These stars have masses lower than the sun, but luminosities that can be or higher, so they will become yellow supergiants for a short time. Post-AGB stars are believed to pulsate as RV Tauri variables when they cross the instability strip. The evolutionary status of yellow supergiant R Coronae Borealis variables is unclear. They may be post-AGB stars reignited by a late helium shell flash, or they could be formed from white dwarf mergers. It is expected that first-time yellow supergiants mature to the red supergiant stage without any supernova. The cores of some post-red supergiant yellow supergiants might collapse and trigger a supernova. A handful of supernovae have been associated with apparent yellow supergiant progenitors that are not luminous enough to be post-red supergiants. If these are confirmed then an explanation must be found for how a star of moderate mass still with a helium core would cause a core- collapse supernova. The obvious candidate in such cases is always some form of binary interaction. Yellow hypergiants Particularly luminous and unstable yellow supergiants are often grouped into a separate class of stars called the yellow hypergiants. These are mostly thought to be post-red supergiant stars, very massive stars that have lost a considerable portion of their outer layers and are now evolving towards becoming blue supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars.

Menconi served two terms on the Board of County Commissioner of Eagle County, Colorado from 2001 to 2009 as a Democrat. He was also the founder and former Executive Director of a national youth development charity SOS Outreach. He earned his M.B.A. at the University of Denver, Colorado and undergraduate in Communications at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. Early life and education After moving to Vail, Colorado in 1991, he started working at a ski rental shop in Avon with a bunch of local high school students. Arn saw a need for the snowboarding community to reach out to those who would not otherwise have an opportunity to visit the mountains. A fully certified snowboard instructor through the American Association of Snowboard Instructors, Menconi produced the largest amateur snowboard series for ten years through SOS. Menconi is also President of Vail Velo, the Vail Valley's biking club. SOS Outreach In 1993, Menconi founded, and was the Executive Director of, SOS Outreach, formerly the Snowboard Outreach Society, the county's largest winter sports-based youth developmental agency from 1993 to 2015. The mission of SOS Outreach is to build character in underserved and underprivileged youth to enhance decision- making for healthy and successful life experiences. Headquartered in Vail, Colorado, SOS teaches over 3000 kids each year at 30 ski resorts in the United States. Political career In 2000, Menconi was elected to the Board of County Commissioners in Eagle County, Colorado as a Democrat. He was reelected to his second term in 2004 and term limited in 2008. He held many board positions on local economic, environmental and social capital posts and state and national designations. For six years he was the Vice Chair of the Colorado Counties, inc. Health and Human Services Committee and a board member of the National Association for Counties' Human Services board. He is the co-founder of the Eagle County Economics Council, a local economic development group. Menconi created the Eco Sports website, the county's only online mapping chamber for counties to showcase their recreational opportunities. Menconi's term was considered controversial by many. He advocated for a social justice focus by creating sustainable growth management, affordable housing, budget analysis leveraging social programs and early childhood development. Twice conservatives tried to recall him without success and his first opponent accused him of having snowboarders from a neighboring county illegally vote for him. Menconi is looking forward to spending more time with his family and with SOS Outreach upon his term limit at the end of 2008.http://www.postindependent.com/article/20080117/VALLEYNEWS/31921967 In 2016, Menconi switched his party affiliation from the Democratic Party to the Green Party. Also in 2016, he announced his candidacy for U.S. Senate in the state of Colorado, challenging Democratic incumbent Michael Bennet, who was running for a second term in the Senate. Early childhood development and environmental activism In 2006, Menconi led a tax increase proposal to raise funds for early childhood development that lost at the polls. Menconi created a subsequent county-funded million dollar program that was the first early childcare program to bring together all four areas of early childhood ‚Äî education, health, special needs and family resources.http://www.vaildaily.com/article/20080304/EDITS/655343215/-1/rss01 Menconi helped to bring permanent funding for open space and placed thousands of areas into preservation. He led the successful campaign to acquire the two largest open space parcels in Eagle County. Working with a multi-generational ranching family and community activists, prevailed over a two-year period to save a pristine parcel of ranch land that serves as the gateway to Glenwood Canyon.

The site is along the Via Clodia, and is not far from the more well known Etruscan town of Tarquinia. History The ancient name of the site is uncertain; some sources identify it with the ancient Etruscan town known as Orclae, whose name is reported in medieval sources. The locale was already inhabited in the Bronze Age, and the city and its adjoining necropolis grew with the arrival of the Etruscans. The urban settlement reached its high point between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC The tombs are generally constructed from large blocks of tuff carved directly into the cliff, and are entered from stairs heading down into the rock. Their cliffside construction, rather than being built on the ground, makes the tombs unusual for the Etruscans. Originally bodies were placed within stone sarcophagi that may still be found in many of the tombs. The site was later inhabited in medieval times, and remnants of a castle and church still remain. It was abandoned as a settlement in the 14th century.

Iceland is not a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), but has ambitions to eventually join the European Cricket Council, which would make it an associate member of the ICC. History It is likely that cricket was introduced to the country in the 20th century by immigrants and expatriates from cricket-playing nations such as England, Australia, and India. The 1944 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack records two wartime games played between the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, with the Air Force winning by 36 runs in the first game and 24 runs in the second. Efforts to grow participation in cricket by Icelanders are ongoing, however, there remains strong competition from more popular and established sports, such as football, handball, swimming, skiing and athletics. Governing body Cricket in Iceland is organised by Krikketsamband √çslands (the Icelandic Cricket Association). , they had 35 registered players. National team A national team was formed in 2008, and competed at the 2016 Pepsi Cup tournament in Prague, finishing fifth out of six teams. They played their first (unofficial) international match, a win against Switzerland, in England during July 2018. Members of the r/Cricket forum on Reddit had raised money for the team through crowdfunding and became their official sponsors. Domestic competitions Two cricket clubs, the Reykjav√≠k Vikings and the K√≥pavogur Puffins, were set up in 2014. They compete in a five-match series for the Domestic Cup, now rebranded as the Volcanic Ashes as part of the Reddit sponsorship. A six-a-side tournament called the √çslensk Premier League (√çPL) was introduced in 2018. Grounds Iceland's first purpose-built cricket ground, the most northerly in the world, opened in Hafnarfj√∂r√∞ur in May 2019 and was officially inaugurated by Katr√≠n Jakobsd√≥ttir, the Prime Minister of Iceland.

Since the Intuitionistic school of mathematics, as formulated by L. E. J. Brouwer, rejects the idea of a completed infinity, in order to use a sequence (which is, in classical mathematics, an infinite object), we must have a formulation of a finite, constructible object that can serve the same purpose as a sequence. Thus, Brouwer formulated the choice sequence, which is given as a construction, rather than an abstract, infinite object. Lawlike and lawless sequences A distinction is made between lawless and lawlike sequences. A lawlike sequence is one that can be described completely--it is a completed construction, that can be fully described. For example, the natural numbers \\\\mathbb N can be thought of as a lawlike sequence: the sequence can be fully constructively described by the unique element 0 and a successor function. Given this formulation, we know that the ith element in the sequence of natural numbers will be the number i-1. Similarly, a function f : \\\\mathbb N \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb N mapping from the natural numbers into the natural numbers effectively determines the value for any argument it takes, and thus describes a lawlike sequence. A lawless (also, free) sequence, on the other hand, is one that is not predetermined. It is to be thought of as a procedure for generating values for the arguments 0, 1, 2, .... That is, a lawless sequence \\\\alpha is a procedure for generating \\\\alpha_0, \\\\alpha_1, ... (the elements of the sequence \\\\alpha) such that: *At any given moment of construction of the sequence \\\\alpha, only an initial segment of the sequence is known, and no restrictions are placed on the future values of \\\\alpha; and *One may specify, in advance, an initial segment \\\\langle \\\\alpha_0, \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_k \\\\rangle of \\\\alpha. Note that the first point above is slightly misleading, as we may specify, for example, that the values in a sequence be drawn exclusively from the set of natural numbers‚Äîwe can specify, a priori, the range of the sequence. The canonical example of a lawless sequence is the series of rolls of a die. We specify which die to use and, optionally, specify in advance the values of the first k rolls (for k\\\\in \\\\mathbb N). Further, we restrict the values of the sequence to be in the set \\\\\\\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\\\\\\\}. This specification comprises the procedure for generating the lawless sequence in question. At no point, then, is any particular future value of the sequence known. Axiomatization There are two axioms in particular that we expect to hold of choice sequences as described above. Let \\\\alpha\\\\in n denote the relation \\"the sequence \\\\alpha begins with the initial sequence n\\" for choice sequence \\\\alpha and finite segment n (more specifically, n will probably be an integer encoding a finite initial sequence). We expect the following, called the axiom of open data, to hold of all lawless sequences: :A(\\\\alpha) \\\\rightarrow \\\\exists n[\\\\alpha\\\\in n \\\\,\\\\land\\\\, \\\\forall\\\\beta\\\\in n[A(\\\\beta) where A is a one-place predicate. The intuitive justification for this axiom is as follows: in intuitionistic mathematics, verification that A holds of the sequence \\\\alpha is given as a procedure; at any point of execution of this procedure, we will have examined only a finite initial segment of the sequence. Intuitively, then, this axiom states that since, at any point of verifying that A holds of \\\\alpha, we will only have verified that A holds for a finite initial sequence of \\\\alpha; thus, it must be the case that A also holds for any lawless sequence \\\\beta sharing this initial sequence. This is so because, at any point in the procedure of verifying A(\\\\alpha), for any such \\\\beta sharing the initial prefix of \\\\alpha encoded by n that we have already examined, if we run the identical procedure on \\\\beta, we will get the same result. The axiom can be generalized for any predicate taking an arbitrary number of arguments. Another axiom is required for lawless sequences. The axiom of density, given by: :\\\\forall n \\\\, \\\\exists \\\\alpha [\\\\alpha\\\\in n] states that, for any finite prefix (encoded by) n, there is some sequence \\\\alpha beginning with that prefix. We require this axiom so as not to have any \\"holes\\" in the set of choice sequences. This axiom is the reason we require that arbitrarily long finite initial sequences of lawless choice sequences can be specified in advance; without this requirement, the axiom of density is not necessarily guaranteed.

Based on a true story, the plot follows a group of anti- guerrilla soldiers, whose lives are turned upside down after finding $45 million hidden in the jungle. Plot The film begins with a young mother named Herlinda (Carolina Ram√≠rez) and her 6 year old daughter Simona who comes to a remote village in southern Colombia, Herlinda asks a grocer go to the village of Coreguaje but a driver accepts carry them but then refuses to see the lady but she had little money and Simona convince him. Them being carried by the driver, Herlinda reads a letter from her husband Elmer Porras, soldier of the national army of Colombia, who several days ago had lost the life savings of between Herlinda and a real estate business which resulted in running a scam that family into possible bankruptcy. The story moves to a few days ago in soldiers are faced with the ultimate temptation, which affects their ethical standards in different ways. Justo Perlaza (Carlos Manuel Vesga), Silvio Lloreda (Diego Cadavid), Nelson Venegas (Juan Sebastian Aragon) and Porras (Manuel Jose Chaves) are four soldiers in the Colombian Army who are part of a counter-guerrilla unit dedicated to ferreting out revolutionaries who have set up camp in the nation's jungles. Porras is married and a dedicated family man, while the others are single and like to party hard when they are not on duty. The four soldiers visits a brothel in a nearby town in the battalion, in the above mentioned place the soldiers initiate a muss because of Perlaza's obsession towards an attractive prostitute known as Dayana (Ver√≥nica Orozco). The next day the soldiers firing anti-guerrilla combat against a FARC front which managed to escape the siege. After cleaning up after an ambush by guerillas, a few meters from the site of the battle, the soldiers find a guerilla camp whose occupants before fleeing had few provisions, having to feed on sugar water and apes, and close to the camp the soldiers seized a small arsenal of the guerrillas, but Solorzano noted that several soldiers of the troops suffering from diarrhea and malaria and calls for air support to take out soldiers and Major Loaiza (Julio Correal) warns that transport can not send them out of the jungle by weather issues. A few minutes later the soldiers learn that their mission is not only to fight the guerrillas but rescue American engineers held hostage by the guerrillas, an order which Venegas berates Lieutenant Solorzano (Marlon Moreno) who in his position reminds him of his duty as a soldier. The soldiers also scanty of provisions sup on the same night rice with meat of ape but the above mentioned situation it begins to disappoint the soldiers, and to the moment Perlaza excreting in spite of the diarrhea it fixes his survival knife in something that seems to be anti-personnel mines but for his surprise it is the hiding place of an enormous quantity of money hidden in a can. Perlaza reported the discovery to his friends who early in the morning discover not only the money in the can but more money contained in more cans. The only one in rejecting the money is Porras, but accidental Lloreda actives a mine provoking a small explosion that alerts the soldiers. Solorzano discovers fragments of bills falling down as a result of the explosion, Solorzano discovers his soldiers makes a surprising discovery‚Äîseveral tubs buried in the jungle which hold $40 million in cash, hidden by drug kingpins in cahoots with the guerillas. While Porras predictably maintains they should leave the money and tell Lieutenant Solorzano about it, the others want to take the fortune for themselves. The soldiers decide not to appropriate only but also to distribute between if the same Colombian pesos and the contained dollars. Porras insists report money to battalion command peers reject her suggestion knowing that in a country so corrupt that money passed into the hands of corrupt politicians but Porras insists report the money to the command of the battalion but his companions reject his suggestion knowing that in such a corrupt country the above mentioned money would go on to hands of corrupt politicians, Solorzano orders Porras to be silence and Porras in turn it rejected his part of the booty by principles but Perlaza vainly tries to convince him that he can of the use the money to him after what he had lost in the real estate business. In the following days the soldiers invest money in each basic necessities, also exchanged pesos for dollars, betting and finally using some dollars to fuel a fire. However, the soldiers begin to lose patience not only due to lack of food but also the desire to go to a nearby town or village and invest money. A helicopter ride to see the sky, Venegas fired his gun to draw attention which fails and insists Lieutenant Solorzano ask the battalion air transport but Solorzano replied that he can not send the battalion after calling several times, Venegas desperate shooting at his own leg, thus giving the argument Lieutenant Solorzano to take the squad of the jungle. Solorzano called the battalion arguing that after a guerrilla harassment of one of the soldiers had been hurt and the Mayor Loaiza decides to send helicopters to bring the soldiers. Solorzano requires soldiers to hide the money so that nobody in the battalion suspected. Half an hour later two helicopters arrive, one that collects the weapons seized and the injured Venegas, the other picks up the squad. This helicopter does not reach the military airport but a road that would take them to the battalion, hence the soldiers should go to the military airport. Soldiers along the way discovered a small shop in a village, and the soldiers pay a large sum of money to the shopkeeper (Gloria G√≥mez) who gives them bread, stew, fruit, soft drinks, etc. food enjoyed by soldiers. Soon Solorzano communicates again with the battalion and Major Loaiza requires troop battalion comes soon, knowing that walking would not arrive, Solorzano comes with the troops at a rest stop and pay a driver (the same guy who brings days later Herlinda) and a trucker (√Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez) for the lead to military airport. During the trip Perlaza argues that the Virgin Mary had given the money in the jungle. Shortly after the military airport manager requires the captain (Rams√©s Ramos) to make a requisition for be sure that the soldiers had not stolen the AK47 rifles but the soldiers begins be fearing to be discovered, but Porras not having accepted the money goes from first to requisition without the captain find nothing but the stink of his backpack. But at the moment requisitioned to Lloreda, Lieutenant Solorzano receives a call from Mayor Loaiza who demands to see the troops soon, so the soldiers addressed the Hercules aircraft en route to the battalion. Porras is hailed by soldiers for passing first through the requisition, and the joyful moment when the soldiers sang the anthem of the military forces of Colombia, an angry Lloreda threatens to detonate a grenade due that someone had stolen his part of the money, his companions ask him not to do it and there is discovered that Corporal Cata√±o stolen the money for what Solorzano demands from him to return it to what Cata√±o refuses and underestimates that Lloreda makes explode the grenade but Lloreda pulls the spike of the grenade but is stopped by other soldiers. The soldiers come unharmed to the battalion and come to the bedrooms where Venegas had come before after having got treatment for his wounded leg, Perlaza tries to tell him what had happened in the plane. For his part Lloreda is sent to psychology and the psychologist tries to investigate on his behavior in the plane that could have unleashed a tragedy, but Lloreda answers suffer post-traumatic stress because of battling in the jungle. To the moment Lloreda it comes to the bedrooms where his companions suspect and are afraid that it has betrayed them, Lloreda denies to have done it. The Lieutenant Solorzano believes him, since if it had betrayed them, the military police already would be requisitioning the beds and the belongings, Solorzano returns the money to him and it is required silence from him while he would ask for a permission the Major Loaiza in order that the soldiers could go out for the nearby people and get out the money, which it obtains to the moment; Loaiza has given a permission of exit for one day, therefore Solorzano demands from the soldiers the soldiers not to call the attention with the money because it would cause a domino effect that would fuck them all. Lloreda, Perlaza, Porras and Venegas go on a taxi into town and Venegas gives the driver (Frank Beltr√°n) a wad of cash to accompany them all day. the four soldiers spend money on fine clothes and sportswear, in relaxation in a spa and an elegant restaurant. Porras being the only one who had no money he was invited by his friends and by his side Lloreda buy a luxury van. Finally the 4 other soldiers accompanied by their partners come to the brothel and taking more wads of cash paid to the owner (Federico Lorusso) to organize a private party. Perlaza go to the room where is Dayana who was about to have sex with another man, but Perlaza throws the man of the room and gives him money. Dayana claims him for his action and Perlaza answers him that it does not want sex with her but to want to have a serious relation with her, declaring his love, Dayana is surprised at his words and seeing that as welded tape-worm a scanty salary would not be possible to have a stable relation but Perlaza shows her all the money that had of the cove, as what both have sex. Meanwhile in the bar, the soldiers and the driver enjoy the extravagant party and Perlaza given the news of his possible engagement with Dayana. Porras is the only one that is not about prostitutes being faithful to his marriage vows and leaves the party vowing to always care for their friends. Herlinda and Simona continue their journey even reading the letter her husband coming to a small village and a coachman offers bring as close as possible to the sidewalk, in the letter according Porras despite the joy already happen 'from laughter to tears '. The party in the brothel continues until the dawn. A sergeant in the battalion warns his superior of an anonymous call making serious accusations against a soldier; Perlaza awake in the room discovered that Dayana was gone and had stolen the money, he tries ask for it, but Perlaza is arrested by men of the military police and knowing that Dayana had not only stolen, also betrayed him. Lloreda meantime the battalion arrives in his new van so striking entrance soldier who alerts the Mayor Loaiza. Later, other soldiers trying to enter the battalion but are immediately arrested, Venegas from the taxi to see this situation know that they will also catch him and tries to flee, but not before hiding the money within a TV and sends his family with express orders not to turn it on, but his younger brother ignoring the situation turns on the TV, and the TV explodes what triggers anger Venegas's dad. Venegas is subsequently arrested and taken in the same van that seconds before Perlaza who urges his friend to flee. Lloreda is taken to judgment being a judge the Major Loaiza. Lloreda denies to know on the money of the guerrilla warfare arguing to buy the luxurious light truck with the savings of the salary, but Loaiza does not believe him since a soldier gains less than one minimum wage. Then a soldier enters the court room wing reporting to Major Loaiza had found nothing in Lloreda belongings or truck except a camera whose roll is sent to reveal by the Mayor. Lloreda begins to fear and this photographic roll there are compromising photos of him and the soldiers in the jungle with the money, the Major Loaiza offers Lloreda to betray to negotiate since it was compromised up to the neck. Later Loaiza interrogates Venegas for whom before he was feeling admiration but then disappointment on having known that he had taken possession of this illegal money. Venegas defends himself arguing that would return to take the money in the same opportunity to finance his career as official. Mayor Loaiza warns Venegas with such decision ruined his career but Venegas makes a scandal and refuses to betray the whereabouts of the money. The soldiers are imprisoned but Lloreda is led by soldiers of the military police and his colleagues believe that he betrayed them except Perlaza and Venegas who know that Dayana was who had betrayed but that does not matter to Perlaza who believes what happened to her was worth it. Porras guessing what would happen decides to desert the army. His wife Herlinda arrives at the store where he and the other soldiers had eaten and had given large sums of money for the service. While Simona was with the shopkeeper to drink water, Herlinda learns the scandal by the radio news of the soldiers who had found the stash of money from FARC whose maximum amount was $40 million. Porras days before send the letter to his wife, who had been reading all this time Herlinda on this adventure. On instructions from her husband in that letter, Herlinda go to a makeshift bathroom where in middle of three rocks found a backpack with many wads of cash, in another letter within the bag, Porras in that letter acknowledges having taken his share of the money, who had tried to give Solorzano and Perlaza. Porras agree that stolen money but knowing what had taken needs of his wife and daughter, but nevertheless Porras loves them and communicate with them soon. Herlinda burst into tears but conceals at his daughter and tells her that they would soon see their husband and father and both walk the horizon. The movie finishes with Perlaza, Venegas, Porras and Lloreda respectively those who present themselves being observed in the mirror the same day they bought fine clothes.

It is a biographical film about the 16th-century playwright Marin Dr≈æiƒá and his conflict with authorities of the Republic of Ragusa. The film marked the return of the veteran director Veljko Bulajiƒá after a 17-year break. Following a long and troubled production, it was released to high expectations, but did not meet a favorable reception from either the critics or the box office. Plot A romance between Marin Dr≈æiƒá and Countess De≈°a forms a major subplot in the second half of the film. The film is set in mid-16th century, at a time when the entire eastern Mediterranean is dominated by two great empires, the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice, with the small but wealthy maritime republic of Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) managing to maintain its independence through diplomatic agreements. The film opens with a scene of playwright Marin Dr≈æiƒá's (Sven Medve≈°ek) comedy Dundo Maroje being staged in front of the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, during the traditional Feast of St. Blaise. Local aristocrats, ambassadors and the Rector himself (Mi≈°e Martinoviƒá) are attending the performance of the comedy play, which is an allegory about the hypocrisy and injustice of high society. The verses spoken on stage are met with disapproval by the noblemen present, and lead to the Rector getting up and leaving during the performance. The Ragusan grey eminence, state censor Luka (Goran Grgiƒá), decides to use this opportunity to crack down on Dr≈æiƒá's company. Luka first confronts his patron Lord Zamagna (Radko Poliƒç), a nobleman and former vice-admiral of the mighty Ragusan trade fleet. Luka charges him with conspiracy and gets him arrested. Zamagna's daughter De≈°a (Sandra Ceccarelli), a noblewoman and wife of the Spanish ship-owner De Cabrera, unsuccessfully tries to free her father, who eventually dies in a Ragusan dungeon. Enraged by her father's demise, De≈°a joins the anti-government conspirators led by Lord Buƒçiniƒá (Ljubomir Kereke≈°) who plot against the Senate (the Ragusan parliament), and, hoping to gain political support abroad, leaves for the Duchy of Florence, itself a powerful city-state in Tuscany in present-day Italy. Despite repression, Dr≈æiƒá's company continues to stage plays and provoke local authorities. The Senate gets increasingly intolerant to any form of criticism and the company soon find themselves in a difficult situation - as the censors had decided to sanction Dr≈æiƒá's thinly veiled criticisms by increasing taxes on his stage productions, the company amasses a huge debt which leads to seizures of their property. Because of this, his close friend, actor Lukareviƒá (≈Ωarko Potoƒçnjak), decides to leave Ragusa and emigrates to Florence. Although Dr≈æiƒá gains some support from his friend the poet Mavro Vetranoviƒá (Vlatko Duliƒá), he also comes into conflict with his brother Vlaho Dr≈æiƒá (Livio Badurina), an acclaimed painter who openly supports the Senate's authority. Staying true to his libertarian beliefs, and unable to continue his work, Dr≈æiƒá also decides to join the conspiracy and leaves for Florence. After reaching Tuscany, Dr≈æiƒá mingles with other Ragusan exiles, including Lukareviƒá and De≈°a Zamagna. Inspired by the progressive society of 16th-century Tuscany, Dr≈æiƒá pens a draft of a new Ragusan statute, which he titles Libertas (Latin for \\"liberty\\"), which enshrines the freedoms of speech and creative expression. Lord Buƒçiniƒá, in an attempt to gain support for the conspirators' cause, tries to use De≈°a's and Dr≈æiƒá's reputation in Florence and instructs them to turn to Cosimo I de' Medici (Andrea Buscemi), the Duke of Florence, but to no avail as he ignores their pleas. Meanwhile, the Ragusan authorities hire mercenaries to track down and assassinate them all. Ignored by Cosimo I, the plot is effectively terminated as spies locate and execute Buƒçiniƒá and Lukareviƒá. Dr≈æiƒá and De≈°a then decide to escape to Venice, hoping to find refuge in the city in which several of his works had been published, and that the Doge of Venice might be more understanding to their plight. During their perilous journey, the friendship between them develops into a romance. Arriving in Venice, they try to hide but are nevertheless found by assassins. A manhunt through Venetian streets and bridges ensues, in which Dr≈æiƒá deliberately draws the pursuers to himself to lure them away from De≈°a, before escaping by jumping into a canal. At dawn the following day, Dr≈æiƒá is washed ashore. Exhausted and frozen, he is found by the city guards and taken to the poorhouse. As he floats between life and death in delirium he sees his ideals becoming reality. In the final scene, undertakers put his casket on a gondola, which floats away across the lagoon. Cast *Sven Medve≈°ek as Marin Dr≈æiƒá, a Croatian Renaissance playwright. Originally, the primary candidate for the lead role was Medve≈°ek's older brother Rene, while Sven Medve≈°ek was cast as Vlaho Dr≈æiƒá, Marin Dr≈æiƒá's brother, a role that eventually went to Livio Badurina. *Sandra Ceccarelli as Countess Desa Zamagna (alternatively spelled \\"De≈°a Zamanja\\", a Ragusan noblewoman of the House of D≈æamanjiƒá), daughter of Dr≈æiƒá's patron, and later his lover during his exile in Florence *≈Ωarko Potoƒçnjak as Lukareviƒá, a theatre actor and friend of Dr≈æiƒá *Goran Grgiƒá as Luka, the Ragusan state censor and the main antagonist *Radko Poliƒç as Lord Zamagna (or \\"gospar Zamanja\\"), Ragusan nobleman, father of De≈°a and patron of Dr≈æiƒá, who dies in prison after being charged with high treason by the state censor Luka *Andrea Buscemi as Cosimo I de' Medici, the Duke of Florence who Dr≈æiƒá asks for help in overthrowing the Ragusan government *Vlatko Duliƒá as Mavro Vetranoviƒá, a Ragusan Benedictine friar and writer who supports Dr≈æiƒá and his work publicly *Mi≈°e Martinoviƒá as the Rector of Ragusa Production The film had a remarkably long and troubled development history. In a 1992 competition for funding by the Croatian Ministry of Culture, the film was accepted under the working title \\"Project Libertas\\". However, personal and political animosities towards the director kept the project in limbo for eight years. By 2000, Bulajiƒá had recruited Ivo Bre≈°an, Mirko Kovaƒç and Feƒëa ≈†ehoviƒá as screenwriters, as well as Vlado O≈æbolt as a scenographer, but had not yet decided on the cast. At the time, the film's budget was estimated at HRK 12 million (US$ 1.4 million), and the start of the shooting was planned for late 2000. The 16th-century Revelin Fortress in Dubrovnik was one of the shooting locations. The shooting started only in spring 2003, and almost immediately ran into delays and various other problems. Contrary to earlier agreement, the City of Dubrovnik refused to pay for extras' expenses. By May, the shooting was behind schedule due to director's illness and hospitalization, and there were reports - denied by Aleksandar ƒårƒçek, the film's producer - that the cast and the crew were not being paid. The financial difficulties ultimately stopped the filming, and the entire project was in serious jeopardy until the Government of Croatia intervened with a HRK 3.6 million financial guarantee that revived the production activities. The filming was finally completed on April 22, 2005, more than two years after the start, and was followed by post- production in Zagreb and Rome. =Filming locations= Many of the film's scenes were shot on-location. Locations in Dubrovnik include the Revelin Fortress, Stradun, the Sorkoƒçeviƒá Villa, as well as the historical streets of the Old Town. Some of the scenes taking place in Florence were also shot on- location, while some were actually filmed in the medieval Istrian village of Draguƒá. Scenes were also filmed in Venice and in Tuscany. Themes The film's title Libertas (Latin for \\"liberty\\") is a reference to the motto of the Republic of Ragusa: (\\"Liberty is not well sold for all the gold\\"). Although the reviewers were nearly unanimous in recognizing the film's subtext as a condemnation of modern despotism, Variety's reviewer Robert Koehler felt it was referring to Eastern Europe's communist regimes, while Croatian critics saw it rather as an allegory of post-communist Croatia. According to Croatian columnist and film critic Jurica Paviƒçiƒá, a \\"small republic obsessed with independence, but totalitarian on the inside\\" is easily recognized as the 1990s Croatia, which is a reading that Bulajiƒá explicitly agreed with in a 2006 interview. Croatian film scholar Bruno Kragiƒá described Libertas as an overtly political film based on the polar opposition of ideas of freedom and tyranny, embodied in the characters of Marin Dr≈æiƒá and Luka, the Ragusan state censor. In his view, Libertas therefore \\"essentially repeats simplified dichotomies seen in earlier Bulajiƒá's films, [...] The Man to Destroy (1979) in particular, about a progressive visionary and retrograde feudal elites\\". Reception Prior to the film's premiere at the 2006 Pula Film Festival, the expectations were very high. Libertas was well received by the festival audience, with an average score of 4.41/5, ranking 3rd out of 8 films, but the critics rated it second-to-last at 2.55. The film won two minor awards at the festival, Golden Arena for Best Costume Design and Golden Arena for Best Make- up. The reviews were generally unfavorable. Variety described Libertas as an \\"old-fashioned European costume drama\\" which is \\"grandly produced and blandly staged\\". A Nacional review found faults with rigid directing and lack of character depth. The critics disliked the poor dubbing, the \\"unconvincing\\" and \\"forced\\" romance subplot, and mixing of the 16th-century Ragusan dialect with modern Croatian. Ultimately, Libertas fared poorly at the box office. Libertas was Croatia's submission to the 79th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee. The film was adapted into a five-episode (four-episode for the Italian market) TV series which was broadcast in 2008 by the Croatian Radiotelevision and RAI.

An EVD is a flexible plastic catheter placed by a neurosurgeon or neurointensivist and managed by intensive care unit (ICU) physicians and nurses. The purpose of external ventricular drainage is to divert fluid from the ventricles of the brain and allow for monitoring of intracranial pressure. An EVD must be placed in a center with full neurosurgical capabilities, because immediate neurosurgical intervention can be needed if a complication of EVD placement, such as bleeding, is encountered. EVDs are a short-term solution to hydrocephalus, and if the underlying hydrocephalus does not eventually resolve, it may be necessary to convert the EVD to a cerebral shunt, which is a fully internalized, long-term treatment for hydrocephalus. EVD placement The EVD catheter is most frequently placed by way of a twist-drill craniostomy placed at Kocher's point, a location in the frontal bone of the skull, with the goal of placing the catheter tip in the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle or in the third ventricle. The catheter is typically inserted on the right side of the brain, but in some cases a left-sided approach is used, and in other situations catheters are needed on both sides. EVDs can be used to monitor intracranial pressure in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or other brain abnormalities that lead to increased CSF build-up. In draining the ventricle, the EVD can also remove blood products from the ventricular spaces. This is important because blood is an irritant to brain tissue and can cause complications such as vasospasm.  Ongoing care  The EVD is leveled to a common reference point that corresponds to the skull base, usually the tragus or external auditory meatus. The EVD is set to drain into a closed, graduated burette at a height corresponding to a particular pressure level, as prescribed by a healthcare professional, usually a neurosurgeon or neurointensivist. Leveling the EVD to a set pressure level is the basis for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage; hydrostatic pressure dictates CSF drainage. The fluid column pressure must be greater than the weight of the CSF in the system before drainage occurs. It is therefore important that family members and visitors understand the patient's head of bed position cannot be changed without assistance. An example of a healthcare provider order regarding an EVD is: set EVD to drain CSF for ICP > 15 mm Hg, check and record cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intracranial pressure at least hourly. Continuous CSF drainage is associated with a higher risk of complications. The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) can be calculated from data obtained from the EVD and systemic blood pressure. In order to calculate the CPP the intracranial pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) must be available. CPP=MAP-ICP Complications EVD placement is an invasive procedure. It is associated with several potential complications: =Bleeding= Bleeding can occur along the EVD insertion tract or in the several layers of the meninges that prohibit passage into the brain. If drilling or dural puncture is not successful, the surgeon may dissect away dura and create a secondary bleed known as an epidural or subdural hemorrhage. Bleeding from EVD placement can be life-threatening and can require neurosurgical intervention in some cases. The risk of hemorrhage with EVD placement is increased if the patient suffers from coagulopathy. =Mechanical= Mechanical complications from EVD placement can be categorized into: *Malplacement If the EVD is not placed with the tip of the catheter in the lateral or third ventricle, it is considered malplaced. If the catheter crosses critical brain regions such as the internal capsule or the upper brainstem, malplacement can be symptomatic. *Obstruction Obstruction/occlusion of EVD commonly due to fibrinous/clot like material or kinking of the tube. The brain can swell due to pressure build up in the ventricles and permanent brain damage can occur. Physicians or nurses may have to adjust or flush these small diameter catheters to manage medical tube obstructions and occlusions at the intensive-care bedside. *Migration After EVD placement, the drain is tunneled subcutaneously and secured with surgical sutures and/or surgical staples. However, it is possible for the EVD to dislodge or migrate. This will cause the tip of the drain to migrate away from its intended position and provide inaccurate ICP measurement or lead to occlusion of the drain. = Infection = The EVD is a foreign body inserted into the brain, and as such it represents a potential portal for serious infection. Historically, the rate of infections associated with EVDs has been very high, ranging from 5% to > 20%. Infections associated with EVDs can progress to become a severe form of brain infection known as ventriculitis. Protocols designed to reduce the rate of EVD infections have been successful, applying infection control 'bundle' approaches to reduce the rate of infection to well less than 1%. =Neurological= Although neurological deficits from passing the EVD catheter across the brain are uncommon, there can be an association of a patient's poor neurological status with EVD malplacement. In one report, the EVD was inserted too deeply into the fourth ventricle; the authors hypothesized that the patient's coma was due to irritation of the recticular activating system. The patient's level of consciousness improved after the EVD was adjusted.

Scoops was a weekly British science fiction magazine published by Pearson's in tabloid format in 1934, edited by Haydn Dimmock. Scoops was launched as a boy's paper, and it was not until several issues had appeared that Dimmock discovered there was an adult audience for science fiction. Circulation was poor, and Dimmock attempted to change the magazine's focus to more mature material. He reprinted Arthur Conan Doyle's The Poison Belt, improved the cover art, and obtained fiction from British science fiction writers such as John Russell Fearn and Maurice Hugi, but to no avail. Pearson's cancelled the magazine because of poor sales; the twentieth issue, dated 23 June 1934, was the last. The failure of the magazine contributed to the belief that Britain could not support a science fiction magazine, and it was not until 1937, with Tales of Wonder, that another attempt was made.  Publication history and contents  In the early twentieth century, British boys' story papers such as The Magnet and Boy's Magazine ranged over many different genres, including school fiction, adventure, sports, and occasionally science fiction; the magazines were popular but the quality of the fiction was low.Bleiler (1998), p. 583. Science fiction also sometimes appeared in magazines aimed at the adult market, such as Pearson's Magazine, launched in 1896 by the British publishing firm of C. Arthur Pearson,Reed (1997), p. 98.Ashley (1985), p. 562. which intermittently carried science fiction by writers such as H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and George Griffith. In 1933, Odhams, a British publisher, began serializing Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels of adventure on Venus in their weekly magazine, The Passing Show. Odhams and Pearson's were rivals, and Pearson's decided to try a weekly science fiction magazine of their own, launching a boys' paper devoted to the genre the following year.Ashley (1985), pp. 562‚Äì563. Speaights, a printing firm, agreed to accept lower rates for printing Scoops, in order to keep their presses running.alt=Dead and dying people in a London street. The editor responsible for the new magazine was Haydn Dimmock, the editor of The Scout, and later the originator of \\"Bob-a-Job Week\\". Dimmock (who probably did not select the fiction himself) assumed that Scoops' readership would be young, and that no adults would be interested in reading it. His editorial in the first issue declared that Scoops would publish stories that \\"look ahead with the vision of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, whose fiction stories of wonder and science, declared impossibilities at the time of publication, are now fact. Scoops ... will transport its readers from the everyday happenings into the future, with all its exceptions of development and discovery. ... Scoops will endeavour to anticipate the marvels of the age in which we live.\\"Ashley (1985), p. 563. It is possible that Dimmock and his staff were aware of American science fiction magazines, which were available in Britain as remainders, sold at stores such as Woolworth's, but if so they did not understand the new genre, instead relying on boys' fiction writers to fill the magazine. Bernard Buley, who worked as the managing editor for Scoops, was one of these, contributing Master of the Moon, which was serialized over the first eleven issues; Buley had been the editor of Boys' Magazine, which had ceased publication in January 1934. Other contributors included George E. Rochester, Stuart Martin, J.H. Stein, and Reginald Thomas, whose The Striding Terror, about a child who grew to fifty feet tall, was serialized in the first eight issues. The stories were initially anonymous, but later research by W.O.G. Lofts has identified most of the authors. The term \\"science fiction\\" was not used initially; \\"science stories\\" was how Scoops described its contents, which included stories about scientific inventions and aviation among other subgenres. Dimmock and Buley asserted that Scoops provided educational scientific content, a claim also made by Hugo Gernsback, who had been involved in launching the science fiction magazine genre in the US, though in the case of Scoops there was very little justification. Filler material was included with information about inventions and technology, but there was little coverage of scientific topics. Dimmock made an exception to the rule that authors were anonymous for A.M. Low, a well-known scientist and inventor who contributed a novel, Space, serialized in ten instalments starting with the second issue.Ashley (1985), pp. 563‚Äì564. The science fiction historian Mike Ashley suggests that Low's novel, which describes three boys who accidentally travel to Mars, \\"must have evoked considerable interest amongst the youth of 1934\\", but adds that \\"the other stories were not of that quality\\".Ashley (2000), p. 127. British science fiction writers and fans such as John Russell Fearn, Walter Gillings, and P. E. Cleator, one of the founders of the British Interplanetary Society, contacted Pearson's and made Dimmock aware that the market for the genre was broader than he had realized, and that there were specialist writers who might submit stories to Scoops. Cleator had already supplied an article to Dimmock on interplanetary travel, and he began a column on the same topic. Pearson's knew that Scoops circulation was falling, and made the attempt to change course. Dimmock began to include the names of the authors on the stories, the cover was redesigned for the thirteenth issue (dated 5 May), and fiction was obtained from Fearn, Maurice Hugi, and W.P. Cockcroft. Cockcroft's \\"Cataclysm\\", in the 28 April issue, proved popular, and a sequel, \\"City of Mars\\", appeared in the 19 June issue. Conan Doyle's The Poison Belt, which began in the 5 May issue, was \\"unquestionably the finest story to appear in Scoops\\" according to the science fiction historian Everett Bleiler; it had originally appeared in The Strand Magazine in 1913. However, most of the fiction was little improved.Ashley (1985), p. 564. The cover art was mostly unsigned, but Serge Drigin contributed the first two covers, and E.P. Kinsella was responsible for one.Bleiler (1998), pp. 584‚Äì585. The cover art improved after the change in policy, with rotogravured covers and more realistic depictions. The changes Dimmock made did not reverse the trend. Dimmock later told Gillings that \\"demand was not sufficient to give us confidence for the future\\", and Pearson's closed the magazine down. The last issue was dated 23 June 1934. Bleiler records that Speaights also found more profitable work for their presses, and this contributed to Pearson's decision. Although it had never been targeted at adult readers, the failure of Scoops made it appear that Britain was not a viable market for a science fiction magazine. There was apparently enough British interest in American science fiction for Hugo Gernsback to devote the letter column of the August 1935 issue of Wonder Stories to letters from British readers,Ashley (2004), p. 235. but when one of those letters, from James Dudley, suggested that the time was right for a British publisher to start a science fiction title, the editor, Charles Hornig, replied that Scoops' failure \\"proved to us and other British publishers that [the UK] is not yet prepared to support a professional science-fiction magazine enough to make it pay for itself\\". Gillings later described Scoops as \\"the biggest blunder that British science fiction ever made\\",Ashley (2000), p. 128. but, in Bleiler's opinion, the British market was not economically capable of supporting a science fiction magazine at the time. Despite the setback, another publisher, Newnes, considered launching a science fiction magazine in 1935, though their plans were delayed until 1938. Gillings himself was the editor of the next British science fiction title, Tales of Wonder, which published its first issue in 1937,Ashley (2000), pp. 128‚Äì129. while Newnes' magazine, Fantasy, appeared the following year.Ashley (2000), p. 131.  Bibliographic details  Scoops was published by C. Arthur Pearson of London. The schedule was weekly; the first issue was dated 10 February 1934, and the run ended on 23 June 1934 with the twentieth issue. Haydn Dimmock was the editor for all of Pearson's juvenile papers, including Scoops, though he was not credited in the magazine.Ashley (2000), p. 126. Bernard Buley was on the editorial staff, taking on the role of the managing editor.Bleiler (1998), p. 584. Scoops was printed in tabloid format; each issue was 28 pages and was priced at 2d.Ashley (1985), p. 565. The print run was 100,000 copies weekly. Distribution was weak, and the magazine is now rare and commands high prices. Five stories from Scoops, along with eight other new stories, appeared in a 1937 collection from Pearson's titled The Boys' World of Adventure; the illustrations from Scoops, by Serge Drigin, were included; the new stories might have been bought for Scoops prior to its demise.

It was Iraq's submission to the 79th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee. About Mohamed Al-Daradji returned to Iraq shortly after the American invasion of Baghdad. There he found psychiatric patients wandering on the streets as the hospitals were being destroyed by the bombings. The experience served as the germ for what would be Mohamed's first feature film, Ahlaam, and the second Iraqi feature produced since the fall of Saddam Hussein. It was filmed on location in Baghdad in 2004. \\"I would like to bring the subject very close to the audience with an artistic point of view\\" he said.Ahlaam DVD bonus features, Mohamed Al-Daradji's biographical content During the time when Ahlaam was filmed was when the insurgency was most dangerous in Iraq. Al- Daradji and his crew took many risks while filming Ahlaam: Al-Daradji was captured twice and tortured by rival insurgents while his cast and crew came under fire from both militias and US troops. Al-Daradji commented \\"As Iraqi filmmakers, we must stay in our own country and make our films, even with all the dangers...We must show the Iraqi point of view. You don't know how important it is for us to tell our stories.\\" Two years after Ahlaam's international premiere, it was shown in Mohammed's home country of Iraq at the Baghdad National Theatre. Despite 200 people being killed that day following a surge of attacks across Baghdad, 1,000 people made their way to the screening. Synopsis The film begins with a shot of Baghdad in 2003, two days before the fall of Saddam's regime. It is nighttime, and the city is ablaze with fire and smoke. Two of the main characters call out the names of their loved ones from within the psychiatric ward of a Baghdad hospital, against a backdrop of explosions and gunfire. The film then cuts to five years prior in Baghdad, 1998. The three main characters, Mehdi Ali Al-Lam, Ali Hussein Araheif, and Ahlaam Mohamed Al-Saadi, are in the midst of every-day life. Ahlaam is attending University, Mehdi is getting ready to take his exam for medical school, and Ali is working as a soldier in the Iraqi military. As the movie progresses each character is faced with a turning point in their lives. For Ali, his turning point is Operation Desert Fox. He is stationed with his best friend Hasan when they are hit by the American and British bombing of Iraq in December, 1998. Hasan sustains fatal injuries, and Ali attempts to carry him to a hospital. Ali crosses a border while carrying his friend and is picked up by a van and sent to the army jail. In the army jail, he is charged as a deserter and sentenced to have his ear cut off and to incarceration in a mental asylum. For Ahlaam, the turning point is her wedding day. She is getting ready to marry her betrothed, Ahmed, when he is arrested by Saddam's men. The next time she appears in the movie, she is a patient in the same mental asylum as Ali, calling out Ahmed's name and being treated with shock therapy. For Mehdi, the turning point is when he discovers he will have to join the military rather than become a doctor as planned because his father was a communist, and thus Mehdi does not have the proper connections to achieve his goal and avoid military service. After explaining how the three main characters all arrive to the psychiatric institution, the movie cuts back to Baghdad in 2003, back to the opening scene. After serving in the military for one year, Mehdi became a doctor. In 2003, he happens to be the new doctor at the mental asylum holding Ali and Ahlaam. Presently, the mental asylum is hit by a bomb. Many of the patients, including Ahlaam, escape into Baghdad. Dr. Mehdi enlists the help of Ali to round up the patients and bring them back. The film follows Ali, Ahlaam, and Mehdi as they wander around an empty Baghdad. Ali works to recover lost patients and help bring them to safety, while Ahlaam wanders confused and lost; she is taken advantage of by a man who she thinks is Ahmed. Ali is fatally shot as he is trying to help return patients. Ahlaam runs away into an abandoned building; as Mehdi and her family try to enter to find bring her back to safety, they are blocked by American forces who don't understand the situation and answer with force. The final shot of the film shows her standing on top of the building, looking at Baghdad.

Hinging on the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex, the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex. Once the defendant was in custody, the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints (such as debt or detinue) would be substituted. The bill was part of a large reform movement to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832. As a result of reforming actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on the business of the Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice. Background The Court of Common Pleas and Court of King's Bench were two of the central common law courts in England and Wales from the 13th century until their dissolution in 1875. The Common Pleas' jurisdiction was over \\"common pleas,\\" cases where the king had no interest. This in practice meant cases between subject and subject, including all actions taken under praecipe to recover debts or property, which made up the vast majority of civil cases.Baker (2002) p.38 The Jurisdiction of the King's Bench, on the other hand, was over \\"pleas of the crown\\"; cases which involved the king in some way. With the exception of revenue matters, which were handled by the Exchequer of Pleas, the King's Bench held exclusive jurisdiction over these cases. Crucially, it retained some criminal jurisdiction over all cases in Middlesex, the county where it sat.Bonner (1933) p.6 During the 15th century, the traditional superiority of the common law courts was challenged by ecclesiastical courts and the equitable jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, exercised through the Court of Chancery. These courts were more attractive to the common lawyers because of their informality and the simple method used to arrest defendants. The bills of complaint and subpoena used by the Chancery made court procedure far faster, and from 1460 to 1540 there was a steep decline in the number of cases in the common law courts, coinciding with a sharp increase in cases in the newer courts. This loss of business was quickly recognised by the King's Bench, which was urged by Fairfax J in 1501 to develop new remedies so that \\"subpoenas would not be used as often as they are at present\\". From 1500 the King's Bench began reforming to increase its business and jurisdiction, with the tide finally turning in their favour by 1550. The King's Bench significantly reformed its mode of practice in response, and one of the developments was the Bill of Middlesex.Baker (2002) p.40 Bill The Bill of Middlesex exploited the King's Bench's remaining criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex. Prior to the introduction of bills, a writ would have to be issued, with different writs depending on the issue. If A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, the court would have to issue an individual writ for each action, with associated delays and costs for A, and then ensure that B appeared in court. Bills, on the other hand, were traditionally used against court officials and the court's prisoners; as such, the defendant was assumed to already be in the court's custody and presence in court was unnecessary. Thus a legal fiction arose; if A wished to sue B for trespass, debt and detinue, he would have a writ issued for trespass. B would be arrested as a result, and the detinue and debt actions undertaken by bill after he had been detained.Baker (2002) p.41 Eventually it became even more fictitious; if A wished to sue B merely for debt and detinue, a trespass writ would be obtained and then quietly dismissed when B was detained in custody. This was originally undertaken through getting a writ of trespass from the Chancery, but eventually a shorter workaround was used; as the King's Bench retained criminal jurisdiction over Middlesex, the trespass (which was fictitious anyway) would be said to have occurred in that county, allowing the King's Bench to issue its own bill of arrest. This became known as the Bill of Middlesex, and undermined the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, which normally dealt with such civil cases.Baker (2002) p.42 Impact The Court of Common Pleas As a result of the procedural changes, including the Bill of Middlesex, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold between 1560 and 1640.Baker (2002) p.43 The simplicity and low cost of this procedure drove much business to the King's Bench, which had a negative impact on the Court of Common Pleas and Court of Chancery. Historically, cases now covered by the Bill of Middlesex had been handled by the Common Pleas, using a specialist writ drafted by the Chancery. This writ was very expensive, and as such brought large amounts of revenue to the Chancery and the Common Pleas. Costs varied depending on the amount of money being claimed from the defendant; it was 6 shillings and 8 pence to claim ¬£40, 10 shillings for ¬£100, and ¬£5 for ¬£1,000.Jones (2001) p.2 In return, the Chancery began to bring injunctions against those who claimed Bills of Middlesex, \\"whereby [the judges] are hindered of their fine which should have been paid in [the Chancery] upon the original of the said case\\".Jones (2001) p.4 These injunctions were only temporary; \\"once the fine had been paid there was nothing to prevent a continuation of proceedings in King‚Äôs Bench\\".Jones (2001) p.5 Relatively few injunctions were issued, and thanks to technical loopholes \\"it was a weapon too infrequently used, and too easily parried\\" to have any long-term impact.Jones (2001) p.9 The issuing of injunctions finally ended in 1590, after an ordinance passed by James I increased the costs of King's Bench proceedings. The Bill of Middlesex itself was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.Jones (2001) p.12 As a longer term and more significant development, the Bill of Middlesex was one of several revolutionary developments by the King's Bench met with a conservative reaction from the Common Pleas, fearful of losing its own caseload. The troubles during this period are best illustrated by Slade's Case. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff.Simpson (2004) p.70 The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.Simpson (2004) p.71 In Slade's Case, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, John Popham, deliberately provoked the Common Pleas into bringing an assumpsit action to a higher court where the Justices of the King's Bench could vote, allowing them to overrule the Common Pleas and establish assumpsit as the main contractual action.Boyer (2003) p.127 After the death of Edmund Anderson, the more activist Francis Gawdy became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, which briefly led to a less reactionary and more revolutionary Common Pleas.Ibbetson (1984) p.305 An equilibrium between the courts was eventually reached, but the result was three common law courts (the Exchequer of Pleas, Common Pleas and King's Bench) with near-identical jurisdictions. By the 18th century, it was customary to speak of the \\"twelve justices\\" of the three courts, not distinguishing them, and assize cases were shared equally between them.Baker (2002) p.50 In 1828, Henry Brougham complained in Parliament that The result was the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the divisions between the courts to remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's Bench in the short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.Manchester (1980) p.148 ReferencesBibliography   * Category:Legal fictions Category:Medieval English court system Category:Legal history of England ","title":"Bill of Middlesex"},{"id":"18070835","text":"XHFW-TDT is an independent television station in Tampico, Tamaulipas.

Born in Bath, Somerset, Hill was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst before joining the British Army in 1931 and being commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers. He commanded a platoon for a short period, and was then attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort during the Battle of France in May 1940, where he oversaw the evacuation of Brussels as well as the beach at De Panne during the evacuation of Dunkirk. After a brief period of time in the Irish Free State, he volunteered for parachute training and joined the 1st Parachute Battalion, and was its commanding officer when its parent formation, the 1st Parachute Brigade, was deployed to North Africa. Hill commanded the battalion during its first airborne operation in North Africa, dropping near the towns of Souk el-Arba and B√©ja, in Tunisia. It secured Beja and then sent out patrols to harass German troops, ambushing a convoy and inflicting numerous German casualties, and defended a bridge at Medjez el Bab, although it was eventually forced to retreat. Hill was wounded during an attack by the battalion on Gue Hill, in which he attempted to capture three Italian tanks using his revolver; the crews of two were successfully subdued without incident, but the third opened fire and hit Hill in the chest several times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the French Legion of Honour for his service in North Africa and then evacuated back to England. There he took command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the newly formed 6th Airborne Division, and jumped with the brigade during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5/6 June 1944. After nearly being killed on D-Day, by an aircraft strafing his position, Hill commanded the brigade throughout the rest of the time it was in Normandy, once leading a counter-attack during a German assault, later being awarded the first Bar to his DSO. After advancing to the Seine, the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn to England in September 1944, but briefly served in the Ardennes in December during the Battle of the Bulge. Hill then commanded 3rd Parachute Brigade during Operation Varsity, the Allied airborne assault over the River Rhine, where he was nearly killed by a glider containing his own personal Jeep. He then commandeered a motorcycle and rode alongside the brigade as the 6th Airborne Division advanced from the Rhine to the River Elbe, at the end of which he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO as well as the American Silver Star. After the war, he was briefly military governor of Copenhagen, for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross, and also raised and commanded the 4th Parachute Brigade (Territorial Army). Retiring from the British Army in 1949, he became involved in a number of charities and businesses. He died on 16 March 2006, aged 95. Early life Hill was born on 14 March 1911, in Bath, Somerset, the son of Major General Walter Hill. He was educated at Marlborough College, where he was the head of the college's Officer Training Corps, and then attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst; there he won the Sword of Honour and became captain of athletics. He joined the British Army in 1931, being commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant into the Royal Fusiliers (City of London regiment), the regiment which his father commanded. He ran the regimental athletic and boxing associations during his service with the regiment, and in 1936 transferred to the Supplementary Reserve in order to marry his first wife, Denys Gunter- Jones. For the next three years he worked as part of his family's ferry company. Second World War When the Second World War began in September 1939, Hill was recalled to his regiment and given command of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers' advance party when the battalion left for France during the same month. The battalion was assigned to the 12th Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Infantry Division. He then commanded a platoon for several months, when the battalion was stationed along the Maginot Line, before being promoted to the rank of Captain in January 1940 and joining the staff at Allied Headquarters. The Battle of France began in May 1940, by which time Hill was attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort; during this period he was involved in planning the evacuation of the civilian population of Brussels, and also carried Gort's dispatches to Calais ordering the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At the end of the campaign, he took command of the evacuation of the beach at La Panne, and was on the last destroyer to leave Dunkirk. For these actions, he was awarded the Military Cross. On his return to Britain, he was promoted to Major and travelled to Dublin in the Irish Free State, where he planned for the evacuation of British citizens from the city should German forces land there. When this task was completed, he volunteered for the fledgling Parachute Regiment, part of the British Army's growing airborne forces, and undertook parachute training; when the 1st Parachute Battalion was formed on 15 August 1941, he was appointed as its second-in-command. The battalion was part of 1st Parachute Brigade, which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division under the command of Major-General F.A.M. Browning.Otway, p. 39 In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid, and got as far as being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being good weather on the day of the raid.Thompson, p. 51 In mid September, as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, would take place in November. After being informed that an American airborne unit, the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was to be used during the invasion, Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included. He argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion, as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations.Thompson, p. 53 The War Office and Commander in Chief, Home Forces were won over by the argument, and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion.Harclerode, p. 209 After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by cross posting personnel from the newly formed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November 1942.Otway, p. 62 =North Africa= As an insufficient number of transport aircraft were allocated to the brigade, it was only possible to transport the 3rd Parachute Battalion by air.Thompson, p. 55Saunders, p. 78 The rest of the brigade arrived at Algiers on 12 November, with some of its stores arriving slightly later. By the evening, reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at Maison Blanche, with the remainder of the brigade following on the morning of 13 November; it was quartered in Maison Blanche, Maison Carree and Rouiba.Otway, p. 75 After several ambitious airborne operations were planned but then cancelled by British First Army, on 14 November it directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and B√©ja; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja to ascertain whether they would remain neutral, or support the Allies; secure and guard the cross roads and airfield at Soul el Arba; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces. 1st Parachute Battalion was selected for the task, to which Hill objected. The battalion had been forced to unload the vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself, and had also to arrange its own transportation to Maison Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers; when it had arrived at Maison Blanche, it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield. Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted, and he did not believe all of the battalion's equipment could be sorted out within twenty four hours; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period, but this was denied.Thompson, p. 58 Panoramic view of modern-day B√©ja. Hill faced further problems as he planned for the operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, and there was no time for any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, small scale map available for navigation.Otway, p. 76Saunders, p. 83 To ensure that the aircraft found the drop zone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot.Thompson, p. 59 The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk el Arba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck mid drop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's second in command, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.Thompson, p. 60 Meanwhile, Hill led the rest of the battalion, approximately 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of B√©ja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he actually did, Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time.Saunders, p. 84 A short time after the battalion entered B√©ja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties.Thompson, p. 61 The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be pro British, and harass German forces.Harclerode, p. 232 The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night.Saunders, pp. 84‚Äì85 At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions.Saunders, p. 85Harclerode, p. 282 When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining anti tank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to B√©ja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars.Saunders, p. 86 After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; B√©ja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.Saunders, pp. 86‚Äì87 The bridge at Medjez el Bab. On 19 November, Hill visited the commanding officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab, and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion. Hill attached 'R' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured. German forces soon arrived at the bridge, and their commanding officer demanded that they be allowed to take control of the bridge and cross it to attack the British positions. The French rejected the German demands, and in conjunction with 'R' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours.Harclerode, p. 233 The battalion was reinforced by the U.S. 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but, despite fierce resistance, the German forces proved to be too strong, and by 04:30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded the bridge and the surrounding area to the Germans.Atkinson, pp. 181‚Äì182 Two days later, Hill received information that a strong Italian force, which included a number of tanks, was stationed at Gue Hill.Thompson, p. 62 Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks, and the following night moved the battalion, less a small guard detachment that remained at B√©ja, to Sidi N'Sir where it linked up with a force of French Senegalese infantry. Hill decided that the battalion's section of 3 inch mortars would cover 'R' and 'S' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force, while a small force of sappers would mine the road at the rear of the hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat.Harclerode, p. 234 The battalion arrived at the hill without incident and began to prepare for the attack; however, just prior to the beginning of the attack there were several loud explosions from the rear of the hill. The anti tank grenades carried by the sappers had accidentally detonated, killing all but two of them.Thompson, p. 63 The battalion lost the element of surprise, and Hill immediately ordered the two companies to advance up the hill. The force reached the top and engaged a mixed force of German and Italian soldiers, who were assisted by three light tanks. Hill drew his revolver, and with his adjutant and a small group of paratroopers advanced on the tanks, firing shots through their observation ports in an attempt to persuade the crews to surrender. This tactic worked on two tanks, but upon reaching the third tank Hill and his men were fired upon by the tank's crew; Hill was shot three times in the chest and his adjutant wounded, although the tank crew were swiftly dispatched with small arms fire.Harclerode, pp. 234‚Äì235 Hill survived because of prompt medical treatment, and was replaced as commander of the battalion by Major Pearson, who supervised the routing of the rest of the German and Italian soldiers. =Normandy= Hill (right) briefing Canadian paratroopers, 6 December 1943. After his injuries were treated, Hill was evacuated to a hospital in North Africa to recover; although forbidden to do so, he often exercised by climbing out of the window of his hospital ward at night.Thompson, p. 125 For his actions in North Africa, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), which \\"paid tribute to the brilliant handling of his force and his complete disregard of personal danger,\\" as well as the French L√©gion d'honneur. By February 1943 he had recovered from his injuries, and was flown back to England where he met up with Brigadier Gerald W. Lathbury, commander of the newly raised 3rd Parachute Brigade. The War Office had authorised the raising of the brigade on 5 November 1942, comprising the 7th, 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions, all converted infantry battalions.Otway, p. 90 The 9th Parachute Battalion was in need of a commanding officer and Lathbury offered the job to Hill, who accepted. His first action was to send the entire unit on a forced march, at the end of which he announced that the battalion would \\"work a six and a half day week\\" with Sunday afternoons off, until it was well-trained and fit.Thompson, pp. 125‚Äì126 The 3rd Parachute Brigade was initially attached to the 1st Airborne Division, but in April 1943 Lathbury was given command of 1st Parachute Brigade, which departed with 1st Airborne Division at the end of April for the Mediterranean theatre and Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily. The 3rd Parachute Brigade was detached from the division in March and remained in England,Otway, p. 93 and on 23 April it was transferred into the newly formed 6th Airborne Division with Hill as the brigade's new commander.Otway, p. 94Otway, p. 140 On 11 August, 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was attached to the 3rd Parachute Brigade; although meant to be assigned to the newly formed 5th Parachute Brigade, also attached to the 6th Airborne Division, it instead replaced the 7th Parachute Battalion, which was transferred to the new parachute brigade. The 6th Airborne Division, under the command of Major-General Richard Nelson Gale, was fully mobilised by late December 1943, with orders to prepare for airborne operations to be conducted during mid-1944. The division's first airborne operation would also be the first time it saw combat, conducting Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5/6 June, D-Day.Tugwell, p. 202 It was tasked with guarding the left flank of the British amphibious landings by securing the area east of the city of Caen, capturing a number of bridges that spanned several rivers and canals, and then preventing any Axis forces from advancing on the British beaches.Harclerode, p. 307 The 3rd Parachute Brigade was given several tasks to accomplish. The 9th Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, was to assault and destroy the Merville Gun Battery, as well as capturing high ground and setting up roadblocks. The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was to destroy two bridges, and the 8th Parachute Battalion had the task of destroying three bridges.Otway, pp. 180‚Äì181 When the operation began, the brigade suffered from a combination of poor navigation by the pilots of their C-47 Dakota transport aircraft, heavy cloud cover and incorrectly marked drop zones, which led to all of its units being scattered over a wide area; Hill himself was dropped with several sticks from the 1st Canadian and 9th Parachute Battalions near the River Dives.Otway, p. 180 He landed in a submerged river rank approximately half a mile from Cabourg, and was forced to wade through four feet of water and a number of flooded irrigation ditches before reaching dry land; the same flooded areas claimed the lives of a number of paratroopers from his brigade.Harclerode, p. 317 Pathfinders synchronising their watches in front of an Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle. Collecting up a number of his men, he headed for the town of Sallenelles, where he hoped to find out how the 9th Parachute Battalion had fared assaulting the Merville Battery. En route, however, he and his party were strafed by low-flying German aircraft, forcing the paratroopers to dive for cover; when the aircraft had departed Hill stood up again, finding that he had been wounded in the buttocks and the officer next to him had been killed. Most of the other men had either been killed or wounded during the attack, leaving only himself and the commander of his headquarters defence platoon; once first aid had been administered to the wounded, Hill continued on and finally managed reach Ranville, where the headquarters of the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Gale, had been set up. After being informed by Gale that his brigade had successfully completed its objectives, Hill had his wound tended to, and then travelled to his own headquarters; there he found Lieutenant Colonel Pearson in temporary command, who informed him that many the brigade's staff had been killed during the drop.Thompson, pp. 162‚Äì164 By 00:00 on the night of 6/7 June, the entire division was fully deployed on the eastern flank of the invasion beaches. The 3rd Parachute Brigade was holding a front, with the 9th Parachute Battalion at Le Plein, 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion at Les Mesneil and the 8th Parachute Battalion in the southern part of the Bois de Bavent.Harclerode, p. 327 For the rest of its time in Normandy the division acted in an infantry role. From 7 June until 16 August, it first consolidated and then expanded its bridgehead.Otway, p. 183 The 3rd Parachute Brigade was responsible for a section of front around the Chateau Saint Come and a nearby manor, with the latter being used as the brigade's primary defensive position. The brigade was positioned next to the 1st Special Service Brigade, and from 7 June onwards German pressure rapidly increased against both brigade's positions, with a number of attacks being repelled between then and 10 June.Otway, p. 184 On 10 June the decision was taken to expand the bridgehead to the east of the River Orne, with the 6th Airborne Division tasked with achieving this; however, it was deemed not to be strong enough, and the 5th Battalion, Black Watch was placed under the 3rd Parachute Brigade's command; the battalion launched an attack on the town of Breville on 11 June, but was met with extremely heavy resistance and was repulsed after suffering a number of casualties. The next day 3rd Parachute Brigade's entire front was subjected to fierce artillery bombardment and assaults by German tanks and infantry, with the Germans particularly focusing on the positions held by 9th Parachute Battalion.Otway, p. 185Harclerode, p. 334 Both the 9th Parachute Battalion and the remnants of the 5th Black Watch defended the Chateau Saint Come but were gradually forced to retreat. Lieutenant Colonel Otway informed brigade headquarters, some away, that his battalion would be unable to hold its ground for much longer; upon hearing this message, Brigadier Hill gathered together forty paratroopers from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and led a counter-attack that forced the German troops to withdraw.Harclerode, p. 335Saunders, p. 196 German attempts to breach the 9th Parachute battalions' positions did not end until 12 June, and Hill stated that the period 7‚Äì12 June were \\"five of the toughest days fighting I saw in five years of war.\\"Thompson, p. 177 It was during this period that Hill was awarded the first Bar to his Distinguished Service Order, after supervising an assault by 12th Parachute Battalion on the town of Breville; the town dominated a long ridge near the Allied bridgehead, from which the German 346th Infantry Division launched repeated attacks. From then on until mid-August the division remained in static positions, holding the left flank of the Allied bridgehead and conducting vigorous patrolling.Otway, pp. 186‚Äì187 Finally, on 7 August the division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive, and on the night of 16/17 August it began to advance against stiff German opposition, its ultimate objective being the mouth of the River Seine (see 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine).Otway, pp. 187‚Äì188 Hill's 3rd Parachute Brigade led the division's advance, being held up until nightfall at the village of Goustranville, but then securing several bridges and allowing the 5th Parachute Brigade to pass through its positions and continue the division's advance. The brigade remained around the Dives canal for several days, and then on 21 August it advanced towards Pont L'Eveque, but was stalled by German infantry and armour near Annebault until 8th Parachute Battalion secured the village. Fighting continued to be fierce, but by 24 August the entire division had advanced across the River Touques. After another three days of reorganising and patrolling, the division's time in Normandy came to an end; in nine days it had advanced 45 miles, captured of occupied territory and taken prisoner over 1,000 German soldiers. Its casualties for the period were 4,457, of which 821 would be killed, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing.Otway, p. 191Harclerode, p. 363 It was finally withdrawn from the frontline in the last days of August, and embarked for England at the beginning of September. =Ardennes= From left to right: Major General Eric Bols, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Brigadiers Edwin Flavell, James Hill, Nigel Poett, and Lieutenant Colonel Napier Crookenden. On 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a huge offensive in the Ardennes forest, with the German objective to split British and American forces apart and capture the port of Antwerp, an important logistical base for the Allies. The initial assaults were extremely successful, creating a salient some fifty miles wide and forty-five miles deep, and by 23 December German units were advancing towards Dinant. American resistance was fierce, however, and blunted German advances in several areas, particularly the U.S. 101st Airborne Division around the town of Bastogne. By Christmas Day the offensive had been halted and contained, and an Allied counter-offensive began. Although the majority of the troops committed belonged to the American First and Third Armies, British XXX Corps also participated, with the British 6th Airborne Division as one of its leading divisions.Thompson, p. 282 The division had been in England since the beginning of September, and had been due to go on Christmas leave only days before the counter-offensive began; however, it was quickly transported to the Ardennes, arriving on the night of 24 December.Thompson, p. 281 By 26 December the 6th Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General Eric Bols, had positioned itself between the towns of Dinant and Namur, and on 29 December it advanced against the German salient, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade, under James Hill, occupying an area around Rochefort.Harclerode, p. 549 When the German offensive had begun, Hill had been in hospital, undergoing reconstructive plastic surgery; this meant that he was unable to join the 3rd Parachute Brigade for two days. When he had recovered, however, he and his batman were flown to the Ardennes and he was able to rejoin the brigade. The 5th Parachute Brigade launched several attacks against German positions in the village of Bure, which resulted in heavy British casualties, and both brigades conducted a large number of offensive patrols.Saunders, pp. 296‚Äì297 The 3rd Parachute Brigade did not see any action, as those German units occupying positions opposite to it withdrew without fighting.Thompson, p. 286 By the end of January, however, the division was transferred back to the Netherlands and set up new positions along the Maas river, where it conducted more patrolling against elements of the German 7th Parachute Division, which held positions on the other side of the Maas. These operations came to an end in late February, when the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn back to England to prepare for a major airborne operation in March.Saunders, p. 298 =Rhine= On 24 March 1945 Operation Varsity began, an airborne operation to aid in the establishment of a bridgehead on the east bank of the River Rhine which involved the British 6th Airborne Division and the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, under Major General William Miley. Varsity was the airborne component of Operation Plunder, in which the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey, and the U.S. Ninth Army, under Lieutenant General William Simpson, crossed the Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal.Harclerode, p. 550 Both divisions would be dropped near the town of Hamminkeln, and were tasked with a number of objectives: they were to seize the Diersfordter Wald, a forest that overlooked the Rhine, including a road linking several towns together; several bridges over a smaller waterway, the River Issel, were to be seized to facilitate the advance; and the town of Hamminkeln was to be captured. The 6th Airborne Division was specifically tasked with securing the northern portion of the airborne bridgehead, including Hamminkeln, a section of high ground to the east of Bergen, and several bridges over the River Issel. Hill's 3rd Parachute Brigade was to drop at the north-eastern corner of the Diersfordterwald forest and clear the western portion of the forest. It would then seize a hill known as the Schneppenberg, secure a road junction near Bergen and eventually link up with the 5th Parachute Brigade.Harclerode, p. 553 C-47 transport aircraft drop hundreds of paratroopers as part of Operation Varsity. The 3rd Parachute Brigade dropped nine minutes later than planned,Harclerode, p. 556 but otherwise landed accurately on drop zone 'A'. Hill landed near to the Diersfordterwald forest, which was occupied by German soldiers \\"who are switched-on people,\\" killing a number of paratroopers whose parachutes became tangled up in the trees. His brigade headquarters was positioned by a copse which was supposed to have been immediately cleared, but when he arrived it was still occupied by German troops; Hill immediately ordered a company commander of the 8th Parachute Battalion to clear the copse. The officer did so, but was killed in the process. Hill then moved his headquarters to the copse, but was then nearly killed by an approaching glider which barely managed to pull up in time, landing in the trees above him; upon investigation, Hill discovered that it contained his batman and personal Jeep, which took some time to lower down safely.Thompson, p. 295 The brigade suffered a number of casualties as it engaged the German forces in the Diersfordter Wald, but by 11:00 hours the drop zone was all but completely clear of enemy forces and all battalions of the brigade had formed up.Otway, p. 307 The key town of Schnappenberg was captured by the 9th Parachute Battalion in conjunction with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, the latter unit having lost its commanding officer to German small-arms fire only moments after he had landed. Despite taking casualties the brigade cleared the area of German forces, and by 13:45 Hill could report that the brigade had secured all of its objectives. With Varsity a success, the 6th Airborne Division was ordered by Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, to advance eastwards. It was supported by the 6th Guards Tank Brigade, and many of the airborne troops used unconventional transport during the advance, including captured German staff cars, prams and even horses. Hill requisitioned a motorcycle for his batman and travelled alongside the 3rd Parachute Brigade as it advanced; at one point his batman stopped the motorcycle and relieved a captured German colonel of his binoculars before driving off again. Hill disapproved of battlefield looting and admonished his batman, although eventually relented by stating \\"If you can get me a pair [as well], you can keep them!\\"Thompson, pp. 301‚Äì303 At midnight, 27/28 March the division came under the control of British VIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Evelyn Barker, and became part of the general Allied advance through Germany towards the Baltic Sea, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade as the division's leading unit.Otway, p. 311 German resistance continued to be heavy, but the division managed to advance at a rapid pace despite this, with the brigade at one point advancing fifteen miles in twenty-four hours, with eighteen of those being spent in combat. By early April the 6th Airborne reached the River Weser, with the brigade approaching it near the town of Minden, accompanied by armoured support; as it did so, the brigade found itself moving parallel to several German tanks, with Hill sitting on the rear of one of the British tanks. Both sides opened fire, but did little damage, the two German tanks managing to outpace the brigade.Thompson, pp. 303‚Äì304 The brigade continued its fast pace of advance, with Hill continuing to ride pillion on his motorcycle, and by 23 April it had reached the River Elbe, having advanced 103 miles in fourteen days; the division had captured more than 19,000 prisoners during this period.Thompson, p. 305 After crossing the Elbe, the division once again came under the command of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, with General Ridgway informing Major General Bols that it was vital the division reach the port of Wismar before the approaching Russian Army did, to ensure that Denmark was not occupied by the Soviet Union. Although the 5th Parachute Brigade was ordered to lead the division's advance, Hill was determined to reach Wismar first; after an extremely rapid advance he succeeded, with troops from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion being the first to enter Wismar, beating an advancing Russian tank column by only a few miles.Thompson, pp. 306‚Äì307 A few days later, on 7 May 1945, Germany surrendered and the war in Europe came to an end.Thompson, p. 308 Hill was awarded a second Bar to his DSO for his command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade during its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, as well as the American Silver Star. Post-war career Memorial at the Pegasus Bridge Museum, Ranville In May 1945 Hill served as military governor of Copenhagen, for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross, and then assumed command of the 1st Parachute Brigade and oversaw its demobilisation. He retired from the British Army in July 1945, although he continued to serve as an officer in the Territorial Army, raising the 4th Parachute Brigade (Territorial Army) in 1947 and serving as its commanding officer until 1949. After standing down as commander of the brigade, Hill served on the board of a number of companies, including Lloyds Bank, the Associated Coal and Wharf Companies, and Powell Duffryn of Canada. Hill was an avid birdwatcher, with a particular claim to fame for being only the second person to discover a cuckoo's egg in the nest of a whinchat. He also helped to set up the Parachute Regiment Association and the Airborne Forces Security fund, acting as a trustee of the latter organisation for thirty years and chairman for five years. Hill married for a second time, wedding Joan Patricia Haywood in 1986. On 6 June 2004 he attended the 60th Anniversary of the Normandy landings, and a bronze statue of him was unveiled at Le Mesnil crossroads by Charles, Prince of Wales, Colonel-in-Chief of The Parachute Regiment. He died on 16 March 2006, two days after his 95th birthday. He is survived by his second wife and a daughter from the first marriage, Gillian Bridget Sanda.

Many of the missionaries were eager to return lest their absence be attributed to some compromise with the government. On 20 January 1586 Pilchard returned to England, and worked for almost a year. In London on business, he was recognised by someone who knew him from Oxford and was arrested early in March 1587, and imprisoned in Dorchester Gaol. Numerous conversions are attributed to him while in prison. Executions for treason being rare in that part of the county, there was some difficulty finding anyone to carry out the sentence.

Its Operational Brief set out six principal objectives:The Special Hospitals: A Short History # ensure the continuing safety of the public; # ensure the provision of appropriate treatment for patients; # ensure a good quality of life for both patients and staff; # develop the hospitals as centres of excellence for the training of staff in all disciplines in forensic and other branches of psychiatry, psychiatric care and treatment; # develop closer working relationships with local and regional NHS psychiatric services; # promote research into fields related to forensic psychiatry. This document also stated that the Authority should be \\"constituted as a small organisation, operating flexibly and maximising delegation of operational responsibility to hospital level, rather than acting as a centralised interventionist body\\". To this end, a Unit General Manager was appointed to oversee the work of each of the three Hospitals. The Authority was abolished in 1996 when its commissioning functions passed to the High Security Psychiatric Services Commissioning Board, while each of the Hospitals became independently managed as a Special Health Authority in its own right.

A scoop wheel pump is similar in construction to a water wheel, but works in the opposite manner: a waterwheel is water-powered and used to drive machinery, a scoop wheel is engine-driven and is used to lift water from one level to another. Principally used for land drainage, early scoop wheels were wind- driven National monument record for typical but surviving wind driven scoop wheel at Turf Fen but later steam-powered beam engines were used.Most of this section taken from 'Machines, Mills & uncountable costly necessities', R L Hills, Goose & Co (Norwich), 1967 It can be regarded as a form of pump. A scoop wheel produces a lot of spray. They were frequently encased in a brick building. To maintain efficiency when the river into which the water was discharged was of variable level, or tidal, a 'rising breast' was used, a sort of inclined sluice. The basic construction is, of necessity, similar to an undershot water wheel. The individual blades were frequently called ladles. Scoop wheels have been used in land drainage in Northern Germany, in the Netherlands, and in the UK, and occasionally elsewhere in the world. They began to be replaced in the mid 19th century by centrifugal pumps. The East and West Fens to the north of Boston, Lincolnshire were drained by such pumps in 1867, but although they were smaller and more economical to install, a Mr. Lunn was still arguing that scoop wheels were a better solution if the initial cost did not rule them out, they were employed in situations where the water did not need to be raised by more than , and where the water levels of the input and output did not vary much.Hills (2008), p.168 An interesting comparison between the two types of pumps is available, because a vertical spindle centrifugal pump was installed at Prickwillow on the River Lark in Cambridgeshire, alongside an existing scoop wheel. A series of tests were carried out in 1880, to check their efficiency. The scoop wheel lifted 71.45 tons per minute through , with the engine indicating that it was developing , while the newer installation was developing , and raised 75.93 tons per minute through . Efficiency was calculated as 46 per cent for the scoop wheel and 52.79 per cent for the centrifugal pump. The most significant difference was the coal consumption, which was reduced from per hour to per hour for the newer system.Hills (2008), pp.170-172 See also *Noria * Sakia *Dredger =Pumping stations employing a scoop wheel= *Dogdyke Engine, Lincolnshire *Pinchbeck Engine, Lincolnshire *Pode Hole, Lincolnshire (scoop wheel no longer present) *Stretham Old Engine, Cambridgeshire *Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum, Somerset (scoop wheel no longer present) ReferencesBibliography= * * External links *Berney Arms windmill, preserved by English Heritage *Summary of scoopwheel history *An american example, sadly without pictures of the wheel Category:Drainage Category:Industrial archaeology Category:Pumps ","title":"Scoop wheel"},{"id":"18071101","text":"Gravehopping (Slovene: Odgrobadogroba) is a 2005 Slovenian film directed by Jan Cvitkoviƒç.

In the latter case let m be the smallest positive integer such that a m = a x for some positive integer x ‚â† m, and let r be smallest positive integer such that a m = a m + r. The positive integer m is referred to as the index and the positive integer r as the period of the monogenic semigroup \\\\langle a \\\\rangle . The order of a is defined as m+r-1. The period and the index satisfy the following properties: * a m = a m + r * a m + x = a m + y if and only if m + x ‚â° m + y ( mod r ) * \\\\langle a \\\\rangle = {a, a2, ... , a m + r ‚àí 1} * Ka = {am, a m + 1, ... , a m + r ‚àí 1} is a cyclic subgroup and also an ideal of \\\\langle a \\\\rangle . It is called the kernel of a and it is the minimal ideal of the monogenic semigroup \\\\langle a \\\\rangle .http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Kernel_of_a_semi- grouphttp://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Minimal_ideal The pair ( m, r ) of positive integers determine the structure of monogenic semigroups. For every pair ( m, r ) of positive integers, there does exist a monogenic semigroup having index m and period r. The monogenic semigroup having index m and period r is denoted by M ( m, r ). The monogenic semigroup M ( 1, r ) is the cyclic group of order r. The results in this section actually hold for any element a of an arbitrary semigroup and the monogenic subsemigroup \\\\langle a \\\\rangle it generates. Related notions A related notion is that of periodic semigroup (also called torsion semigroup), in which every element has finite order (or, equivalently, in which every mongenic subsemigroup is finite). A more general class is that of quasi-periodic semigroups (aka group- bound semigroups or epigroups) in which every element of the semigroup has a power that lies in a subgroup.http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Periodic_semi-group An aperiodic semigroup is one in which every monogenic subsemigroup has a period of 1.

It runs an 18000 sq m hospital in the north of Tehran.Mahak CharityINCTR: Newsletter Mahak Logo  Foundation of MAHAK  The organisation was founded in 1991 by Saideh Ghods. She had experienced having a child with cancer and had witnessed first hand the difficulties faced by her child, and pledged that she would set up a center that would act as a sanctuary for children and their families in a similar situation. With the assistance of the same friends and relatives who had helped her through her own ordeal, a board of governors was selected and the ‚ÄúMAHAK Society to Support Children with Cancer‚Äù was set up as a non-profit, non-governmental Organization. MAHAK has been active from that day in helping children with cancer and their families and has grown beyond anyone‚Äôs expectations. MAHAK is funded entirely by donations and has supported 11,505 children over the past 17 years.  MAHAK hospital and rehabilitation centre  The Mahak hospital In 2003, MAHAK‚Äôs Hospital and Rehabilitation center in Darabad was completed. The center is situated in Tehran‚Äôs North Eastern hills and comprises an 18000 square meters building equipped to accommodate up to 120 children, each accompanied by a member of their family. The center houses diagnostic and treatment wards of the highest standards, on a par with those seen anywhere else. Within the center, there are other facilities offered such as a clinic, a chemotherapy laboratory, radiotherapy section, physiotherapy ward, water therapy section, operation rooms, MRI and CT Scan, Radiology, ICU, library, children's playroom, restaurant, amphitheater and a shopping center.  Operation  The wards were equipped and began operation in August 2003, when the first patient was admitted. The two rehabilitation wards are fully functional and are laid out over two floors, with 15 rooms on the first floor for children accompanied by a female member of their immediate family and with another 15 on the second floor for those children who need to be accompanied by a male family member. There is also a playroom provided for the children, a sitting area for the families and a kitchenette. Currently, these wards are run by 14 nursing graduates in three shifts around the clock. Two social workers offer their services in two shifts of morning and afternoon and two psychiatrists are available in the afternoon shifts. In the afternoons a number of volunteers visit the ward to play with the children. The Society‚Äôs team of social workers is fully active in children‚Äôs oncology wards in nine hospitals throughout Tehran, where they provide children and their parents with medical treatment and support. MAHAK pays all related expenses including X-rays, test, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, food, clothing and all accommodation during their treatment. Since 60% of the children come to Tehran from the provinces, the Social Work Department arranges for their transfer by ambulance or plane. MAHAK has been officially recognized by UNHCR as the organization which helps refugee children (Afghan and Iraqi) with cancer both in and out of refugee camps.  Awards  In 2007, the organisation was presented with the Swiss SGS NGO Benchmarking award for the best and most transparent NGO in the Middle East.

The first permanent settlements and farming date from the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago. From the beginning of the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, beginning in the seventh century BCE, there was use of cultivation ridges and terraces. During the period of Roman occupation there was a reduction in agriculture and the early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration resulting in more unproductive land. Most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet, supplemented by hunter-gathering. More oats and barley were grown, and cattle were the most important domesticated animal. From c. 1150 to 1300, the Medieval Warm Period allowed cultivation at greater heights and made land more productive. The system of infield and outfield agriculture may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century. The rural economy boomed in the thirteenth century, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century. The early modern era saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, which peaked towards the end of the seventeenth century. The closing decade of the seventeenth century saw a slump, followed by four years of failed harvests, in what is known as the \\"seven ill years\\", but these shortages would be the last of their kind. After the Union of 1707 there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Introductions included haymaking, the English plough, new crops, crop rotation and encloses were introduced. The resulting Lowland Clearances saw hundreds of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland forcibly removed. The later Highland Clearances saw the forced displacement much of the population of the Highland as lands were enclosed for sheep farming. Those that remained many were now crofters, living on very small rented farms. In the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in World War II. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming. There was increasing mechanisation and farming became less labour-intensive. UK membership of the European Economic Community from 1972 began a change in orientation for Scottish farming. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Roughly 79 per cent of Scotland‚Äôs total land area is under agricultural production. Cereals accounted for 78 per cent of the land area, while livestock numbers have been falling in recent years. Around 15 per cent of the total land area of Scotland is forested, most in public ownership controlled by the Forestry Commission. Total income from farming has been rising since the turn of the millennium. Aquaculture production is focused on the West and North of the country. Some farm businesses rely on sources of income other than from farming. Scottish agriculture employs around 1.5 per cent of the workforce and contributes to around 1 per cent of the Scottish economy. Topography and climate The Southern Uplands around Durisdeer The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot Hills, over which the border with England runs.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 2. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width,World and Its Peoples (London: Marshall Cavendish), , p. 13. and contains most of the good quality agricultural land.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 39‚Äì40. Scotland is half the size of England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of coastline at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level.C. Harvie, Scotland: a Short History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), , pp. 10‚Äì11. Scotland's soils are diverse for a relatively small country due to the variation in geology, topography, climate, altitude and land use history. There are very productive arable soils in the east of the country, including some of the most productive for wheat and barley of anywhere in the world. Scotland's soils differ from much of the rest of the UK and Europe and they provide valuable habitats for wildlife and flora. They are largely naturally acidic in nature with high concentrations of organic carbon. They are predominantly coarse textured and often exhibit poor drainage.Scotland's soils: key facts , Scotland's Environment, retrieved 1 June 2015. The climate of Scotland is temperate and very changeable, but rarely extreme.Met Office: Scottish climate, Met Office, retrieved 1 June 2015. Scotland is warmed by the North Atlantic Drift and given the northerly location of the country, experiences much milder conditions than areas on similar latitudes. Average temperatures are lower than in the rest of Great Britain.

Aerial photography reveals extensive prehistoric field systems that underlie existing boundaries in some Lowland areas, suggesting that the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for five centuries, suggesting a decline of population and agriculture. =Middle Ages= Threshing and pig feeding from a book of hours from the Workshop of the Master of James IV of Scotland (Flemish, c. 1541) The early Middle Ages were a period of climate deterioration resulting in more land becoming unproductive.P.

Most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering.

The more extensive outfield was used for oats. By the late Medieval period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers, known as husbandmen.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 41‚Äì55. Runrigs usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective and cheaper to feed than horses. Key crops included kale, hemp and flax. Sheep and goats were probably the main sources of milk, while cattle were raised for meat.J. T. Koch, ed., Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 26.

In the early seventeenth century famine was relatively common, with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625. The English invasions of the 1640s had a profound impact on the Scottish economy.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 291‚Äì3.

D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 288‚Äì91. The English plough was introduced and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down to combat soil acidity, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 provided a crop with a high yield, providing 3 to 5 times more calories per acre than a cereal crop. Enclosures began to displace the run rig system. The first result of these changes were the Lowland Clearances. Agricultural improvement spread north and west, mostly over the period 1760 to 1850 as the Highland Clearances. Many farming tenants were evicted and offered tenancies in crofting communities, with their former possessions converted into large-scale sheep farms. Crofts were intended to be too small to support the occupants, so forcing them to work in other industries, such as fishing, quarrying or kelping.E. Richards, The Highland Clearances: People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil (Edinburgh, Birlinn Press, 2008), . In the 1840 and 1850s Scotland suffered its last major subsistence crisis,T. M. Devine.

Smout, A Century of the Scottish People: 1830‚Äì1950 (1986), pp. 12‚Äì14. This gave rise to the second phase of the Highland clearances, when landlords provided assisted passages for their tenants to emigrate in a desperate effort to rid themselves of a redundant population that was dependent of famine relief. =Twentieth century= Sheep grazing on slopes of Camp Hill, Bowmont Valley In the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to the ups and downs of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in World War II. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. After World War II there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production.

Modern agricultureLand use= A combine harvester near Loch Leven At the time of the June 2013 agricultural census the total area of agricultural holdings in Scotland was 5.6 million hectares, equal to 73 per cent of Scotland‚Äôs total land area. Just over half of this was rough grazing, with about a quarter taken up by grass, and about ten per cent used for crops or left fallow. The remainder was made up of woodland, ponds, yards or other uses. There was a further 580,000 hectares of common grazing, which if included made the total area 6.2 million hectares, or 79 per cent of Scotland‚Äôs total land area.Natural Scotland Economic Report of Scottish Agriculture, 2014, pp. 1‚Äì2, retrieved 1 June 2015. Because of the persistence of feudalism and the land enclosures of the nineteenth century, the ownership of most land is concentrated in relatively few hands (some 350 people own about half the land). As a result, in 2003 the Scottish Parliament passed a Land Reform Act that empowered tenant farmers and communities to purchase land even if the landlord did not want to sell. In June 2013, of crops grown in Scotland (excluding grass), cereals accounted for 78 per cent of the land area, with nearly three-quarters of that being barley (340,000 hectares). Wheat was also significant (87,000 hectares), along with oilseed rape (34,000 hectares), oats (32,000 hectares) and potatoes (29,000 hectares). Amongst fruit and vegetables, a total of 911 hectares of strawberries were grown, mainly under cover, which was the largest source of income amongst horticulture crops. The major areas of cereal production were Grampian, Tayside, Borders, Lothian and Fife.\\"Farmland Use ‚Äì Cereals and other combine crops 2013\\", The Scottish Government, June 2012, retrieved 13 July 2012. Distinctive Highland Cattle. Numbers of livestock, including cattle have been declining. Livestock numbers have been falling in recent years. The trend began at the turn of the millennium in the case of pigs and sheep and dates to the mid-1970s in the case of cattle. In June 2013 there were 6.6 million sheep, 1.8 million cattle and 308,000 pigs, the lowest numbers since the 1940 and 1950s. Poultry numbers have tended to fluctuate over the last 25 years, but were down to 14.2 million in 2013. About 13,340 km¬≤ of land in Scotland is forested representing around 15 per cent of the total land area of Scotland. The majority of forests are in public ownership, with forestry policy being controlled by the Forestry Commission. The biggest plantations and timber resources are to be found in Dumfries and Galloway, Tayside, Argyll and the area governed by Highland Council. The economic activities generated by forestry in Scotland include planting and harvesting as well as sawmilling, the production of pulp and paper and the manufacture of higher value goods. Forests, especially those surrounding populated areas in Central Scotland also provide a recreation resource. =Income and employment= Total income from farming (TIFF) has been rising since the turn of the millennium. It was estimated at ¬£700 million in 2012, being made up of ¬£2.9 billion in outputs and ¬£570 million in support payments, offset by ¬£2.8 billion in costs. The initial estimate of TIFF for 2013 was ¬£830 million, an increase largely linked to the improved weather. TIFF per annual work unit increased to ¬£31,000, similar to the value in 2011. A fish farm near Tarbet on Loch Nevis Aquaculture production is focused on the West and North of the country. The total output of aquaculture was estimated in 2011 at around ¬£434 million per year, including around ¬£412 million for farmed Atlantic salmon, ¬£14.34 million for rainbow trout and ¬£7.7 million for shellfish. Brown trout, sea trout, halibut and Arctic charr are also farmed in Scotland.\\"Aquaculture Fisheries ‚Äì Aquaculture Support\\", Scottish Government, retrieved 10 June 2012. Some farm businesses rely on sources of income other than from farming, including contracting work, hosting mobile phone masts, tourism and recreation and financial support from grants and subsidies. Analysis of the Farm Accounts Survey suggests that, excluding support from grants and subsidies, the average farm made a loss of ¬£16,000 in 2012. However, calculations from TIFF suggest that, excluding support, the sector still made a small profit. Government figures indicate that in 2013 Scottish agriculture employed around 1.5 per cent of the workforce and contributes around 1 per cent of the Scottish economy. Other studies suggest the employment rate to be around 8 per cent of the total rural population, and in terms of numbers the estimates indicate that around 68,000 people are directly employed or self-employed in agriculture, while around 200,000 people are related to a variety of activities related to agriculture. In the Highlands and Islands, around 10 per cent of the workforce are engaged in agriculture and livestock products contribute around 70 per cent of the output.Rural Scotland People, Prosperity and Partnership Education The West of Scotland Agricultural College formed in 1899, the East of Scotland Agricultural College in 1901, and the North of Scotland Agricultural College in 1904; these colleges amalgamated to form the Scottish Agricultural College in 1990.\\"Scottish Agricultural College\\", The Independent, 1 May 2011.

A Countryside Commission Scotland (CSS) was established under the Countryside Scotland Act, 1967.B. Cullingworth and V. Nadin, Town and Country Planning in the UK (London: Routledge, 2003), , p. 329 The SSSI were strengthened by the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, which for the first time introduced the concept of payments to farmers for inactivity in relation to specific sites and shifted the burden of proof from conservationist having to prove harm, to landholders having to prove that harm was not taking place. The NCC was broken up in 1991 and in Scotland was merged with CSS to produce Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), under a UK-wide Joint Nature Conservation Committee. SNH has a remit for both land and nature conservation and a responsibility towards sustainability and to the consideration of the needs of the Scottish people. Rights of way In Scotland, a right of way is a route over which the public has been able to pass unhindered for at least 20 years.Rights of way in Scotland Scottish Natural Heritage, retrieved 30 June 2015. The route must link two \\"public places\\", such as villages, churches or roads. Unlike in England and Wales there is no obligation on Scottish local authorities to signpost or mark a right of way. However, the charity Scotways, formed in 1845 to protect rights of way, records and signs the routes.Scotsway: The Scottish Rights of Way & Access Society, retrieved 30 June 2015. The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives everyone statutory access rights to most land and inland water in Scotland, to non-motorized traffic, making the existence of rights of way less important in terms of access to land in Scotland. Certain categories of land are excluded from this presumption of open access, such as railway land, airfields and private gardens.Outdoor Access Scotland, retrieved 30 June 2015.

It consists of seven limestone fragments, which were found in a tomb at Amarna. The tablet shows the figures of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and Meritaten. At some time after the stela was made, Nefertiti's name had been chiselled out and was replaced with Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten, the name of Akhenaten's co-regent. At the same time Meritaten's name was replaced with that of Ankhesenpaaten, Akhenaten and Nefertiti's third daughter. The stela might shed light on the events of the little-known late-Amarna Period and the question of Akhenaten's immediate succession. Restoration and interpretation of the stela vary, but it has been suggested that it supports the claim that Nefertiti should be identified as Akhenaten co-regent and successor.

Background and early years Moran was born in Ramat Gan, Israel, to a family of Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel from Poland. His father, Baruch Mintz, came from a well- off family from Krosno. The only Mintz family members who managed to survive the Holocaust were Dov's father and grandfather who began a new life in Israel. Dov's mother, Bina Gever, immigrated to Israel with her family who escaped Blonie. His interest in technology was obvious from his childhood days. At the age of ten he used to order electronic components and digital watch parts from MAD magazine, with the intention to create new improved devices, however, as he later testified, no significant results were achieved. In the following years, his curiosity and talent started to lead to breakthroughs. At the age of 16 he was sent to an annual course in computers held in Tel-Aviv University. Back then, in order to write a program you needed to mark cards dedicated to that with a pen. After three months of struggling to deal with that system, he wrote his first program. His programming skills improved while obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (with honors) at the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. That was when he decided \\"to start his own company‚Äù. Moran served in the Israeli Navy for seven years and was commander of its advanced microprocessor department. Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Moran was an independent consultant in the computer industry. =Entrepreneurship = Moran formed M-Systems in 1989, a pioneer in the flash data storage market. The company invented the USB flash drive (DiskOnKey), the FlashDisk (DiskOnChip) as well as several other innovative flash data storage devices. Under Moran's leadership, M-Systems grew to $US1 billion revenue within 18 years, and at the end of 2006 it was acquired by SanDisk Corp (NSDQ: SNDK) for $US1.6 billion. After the sale of M-Systems, Moran founded Modu, a company with a new modular phone concept, which eventually sold its patents to Google in 2011. These patents are the basis for Google's modular phone project, called Project Ara. After Modu was sold to Google, more than 30 hi-tech innovative companies were founded by Modu's ex-employees. During his time at Modu, Dov was also the chairman of Tower Semiconductor, a developer and manufacturer of semiconductors and integrated circuits. During his tenure, he turned the struggling company around towards profitability. Moran was also chairman of Biomas, a developer of innovative pharmaceuticals. = Inventions = Moran has been involved with a number of inventions, mostly in the field of infrastructure technologies. He says he has filed over 40 patents and patent applications. Inventions he's been involved with include:100 Doors - An introduction to entrepreneurship, \\"Yedioth Books\\" website (Hebrew) *USB flash drive (DiskOnKey)- small Flash memory device * the FlashDisk (DiskOnChip) * Modu 's revolutionary modular phone - the basis for Google's modular phone Project Ara * Lightest mobile phone - Modu (weighs 40.1 g) world held the record for the world's lightest mobile phone. * Smartype - revolutionary smart keyboard * Comigo's smart interactive TV system - patented hardware and software solutions = Investments = In January 2015, after several years of successful angel investing, Moran founded Grove ventures, a $US100 million venture capital fund primarily investing in early-stage startups with cutting edge technologies such as semi-conductor, sensors, artificial intelligence and Digital Health. In October 2017, Grove Ventures raised $110 million in commitments. His personal portfolio of companies include: * Consumer Physics, A thumb-sized spectrometer which acts as \\"digital materials analyzer\\", enabling a user to identify products' source, freshness, ingredients, the mix of materials and nutrition value. * Sensible Medical Innovation Ltd., Absolute lung fluid monitor based on sensing and monitoring technology providing data for the management and treatment of several chronic medical conditions. * GlucoMe, develops a blood glucose meter that provides an interface to the cloud through a phone or tablet to allow data gathering and analysis, alerts and patient monitoring. * Geneformics, focused on computing for genomics (DNA sequencing). Geneformics aims to provide savings in the storage, communications and cloud processing of DNA sequencing. * RapidAPI, a company that developed APIs (Application Programming Interface) to thousands of programs existing in the web. In addition to several investments (till Feb. 2018, the number is 7) made by the fund. = Community involvement and public sector = Moran perceives education as the grounding for innovation. As such, he mentors Israeli entrepreneurs, assisting in converting research and innovation to business. He lectures extensively in universities and schools and sits on the advisory board of Tel Aviv University Momentum Fund. In addition, Moran has invested in Learni, which brings technology into everyday learning system, and enables rich digital textbooks, in a managed interactive classroom environment. He is an active member of the Korean Israel Business Forum, having spoken at a number of conferences, and in 2014, was asked by the Korean government to spearhead a project aimed at growing innovation in Seoul, the capital of Korea.

History Seirei Christopher University began as the ‚ÄúBethel Home‚Äù, a private tuberculosis sanatorium established in 1932 by local Japanese Christians in Hamamatsu. From the beginning, the sanatorium faced difficulties with finances and hostility from its neighbors due to prejudices against tuberculosis sufferers and followers of Christianity. Although the sanatorium raised funds to acquire land outside of the city by 1937, it continued to experience problems due to the increasingly totalitarian attitude of the pre- war Japanese government. An unexpected donation on Christmas Day, 1939, directly from Emperor Hirohito, resolved both its financial issues and problems with the local government. In the immediate postwar period, the sanatorium expanded into education by forming the ‚ÄúEnsh≈´ School of Christ‚Äù, the forerunner of both \\"Seirei Christopher High School\\" and \\"Seirei Christopher University\\" in 1949. Seeing the need for increased medical services in postwar Japan, the sanatorium created the \\"Seirei Vocational School for Practical Nurses\\" in 1952; it changed its name in 1969 to the \\"Seirei Gakuen Junior College of Nursing\\". In 1992, with the financial help of three billion yen from the Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Company, a four-year \\"Seirei Christopher College of Nursing\\" was founded.

Tommassini sees a fuel truck and attempts to destroy it but however Aldo sees him and shoots him mortally wounding him as he reaches for the TNT, as he attempts to use it, Aldo guns Tommassini down saying his final words, \\"Wells, the world,\\" as he hits the TNT which blows up the wells, only few Italian-American's are left, Valli, Sullivan, Aldo and Corbi, but however Agen kills Corbi and the other Italian-American in the process, Agen soon panics in the attack but at point range, Agen is about to shoot Valli but realizing he is a good kind friend, he screams, \\"No, Valli I can't, VALLI!\\" as Valli witnesses him and understands this, Sullivan all too well kills Agen and shoots him in the back, however Sullivan sees the dead body of Corbi on the ground and takes the bazooka to avenge for his death, Valli however tells Sullivan what is going to happen now, but Sullivan tells Valli he will carry out the plan, just as Sullivan attempts to take out the Panzer he successfully takes it out, but as he goes and makes a breakthrough to the second, Valli calls out, \\"Sullivan look out!\\" but as a result the tank fires at Sullivan mortally wounding him as Sullivan attempts to use a grenade the last thing he ever does is throw it into the caterpillars and the explosion impacts Sullivan and before Sullivan dies, he gets a last look at his memories back in the Pacific before dying from his wounds. The only survivors are Valli and Aldo, but as Valli and Aldo finish off the remaining Germans from the Panzer Tank, Sullivan has just destroyed, Valli and Aldo look at the now dead Sullivan and understand what he died for, but suddenly Valli is shot in the back and killed by a German soldier from nowhere, allowing Aldo now the sole-surviving Italian-American commando of the mission to react, Aldo sees many dead Germans and Italian-American's that where people he knew now gone, all too silent everything seems quiet and now he is all by himself, but not before Hans, the last of Professor Agen's Junior NCO's survived the battle by himself, he nearly attempts to kill Aldo, but he sees in his heart the truth and he begins to understand Aldo's feelings and looks back the time he first met at the dining room, then seeing the truth Aldo and Hans agree a truce and they lay down their guns allowing a truce after realizing they have all their dead friends they have to bury now into graves, Aldo and Hans agree to help, together like friends they now help bury the dead soldiers including Sullivan and many others, and Agen as well, as all are lined up, Aldo and Hans now complete the dead in place and together they now await for allied Americans to come find them,  Cast  * Lee Van Cleef as Sgt.

Often called 'Boxer' Harding, he was a member of the winning Wales team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks in a game considered one of the greatest in the history of rugby union. He played club rugby for Cardiff and London Welsh and county rugby for Middlesex. Club career As an early forward, Harding was a surprisingly nimble player with a good running and passing style along with an excellent kicking ability.Thomas (1979), pg 35. After being chosen to represent Wales in 1902 while playing for Cardiff he moved to England to play for London Welsh in the early part of the 1902/03 season. During the 1903/04 season Harding was chosen to captain London Welsh, a position he held for three seasons. International career 1905 Wales squad, Harding, middle row, far right =Wales= Harding made his international debut for Wales against England at Blackheath in January 1902, while still in his first season for Cardiff. When he first joined the Welsh team he played alongside George Boots from whom he learned much about improving his game.Thomas (1979), pg 35. Harding played in all three 1902 Triple Crown games which saw Wales win the championship. After representing Wales for their fourth Triple Crown in 1905, Harding was chosen to face the Original All Blacks on the New Zealander's first tour of Britain. The fact that Harding had faced the New Zealand side earlier in the tour, when they crushed Harding's Middlesex County, may have played a part in the Welsh tactics that disrupted the All Black's loose-head scrummaging. =International games playedSmith (1980), pg 467.= * England 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1908 * Ireland 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907 * New Zealand 1905 * Scotland 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1908 * South Africa 1906 =British Isles= In 1904 Harding was one of two Welsh forwards chosen to tour AustralasiaSmith (1980), pg 148. under the captaincy of Bedell-Sivright.

She was the daughter of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre of Gilsland, and the second wife of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu. Magdalen, a fervent Roman Catholic, was a Maid of Honour at the wedding of Mary I of England to Philip II of Spain in Winchester Cathedral. Dacre, despite being a Catholic, managed to remain in high regard with the Protestant Tudor Queen who succeeded Mary, Elizabeth I. Dacre was, according to biographer Lady Antonia Fraser in her historical biography, The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Faith in 1605, a fine example of \\"how the most pious Catholic could survive if he (or she) did not challenge the accepted order\\". Early life Magdalen Dacre was born in January 1538 at Naworth Castle in Eskdale Ward, Cumberland, the fifth child of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre of Gilsland, 2nd Baron Greystoke, and Elizabeth Talbot. The Dacres were powerful Northern Border lords and fervent Roman Catholics, however by the time of her birth, Henry VIII, the reigning monarch, had already made the break with Rome by placing the Protestant denomination on England, and had also just produced a male heir, Prince Edward (later Edward VI), with his third wife Jane Seymour just months prior to the birth of Magdalen. Despite the Protestant Reformation sweeping the country, Magdalen Dacre, along with her siblings, were raised Roman Catholic by her family. Dacre's paternal grandparents were Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre, of Gilsland, 1st Baron Greystoke, and Elizabeth Greystoke, and her maternal grandparents were George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, and Anne Hastings, daughter of William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings and Katherine Neville. She had five brothers and five sisters. Her father was the English Warden of the Scottish Marches and Governor of Carlisle. Dacre served as a gentlewoman to Anne Sapcote, Countess of Bedford when she was 13. Magdalen Dacre took part in the bridal procession of the wedding of Mary I (pictured) to Philip II of Spain in 1554 In 1553 Edward VI, the boy king who succeeded Henry VIII, died after six years on the throne, aged 15, the same as Dacre. Mary I, daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon, became Queen of England, and England returned to Roman Catholicism. By 1554 Mary had turned her attention to finding a suitor and producing an heir to the Tudor dynasty, and became engaged to Philip II of Spain. The marriage took place at Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554 and Dacre was selected as a Maid of Honour and took part in the bridal procession. In E. S. Turner's The Court of St. James, Dacre was described as having been very pretty and blonde. She was also very tall, and reportedly stood a head above the other maids of honour at court. Turner alleged that she attracted the attention of Philip, whom she had to beat off with a staff when he tried to embrace her.Emerson, Kathy Lynn. A Who's Who of Tudor Women ‚Äì D =List of siblings= * Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre of Gilsland (1527/1530- 1 July 1566), married firstly Elizabeth Neville, and secondly Elizabeth Leyburne, by whom he had five children, including George Dacre, 5th Baron Dacre of Gilsland, 4th Baron Greystoke, and Anne Dacre, later Countess of Arundel (21 March 1557 ‚Äì 19 April 1630). When Thomas died, his widow remarried Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. * Leonard Dacre (died 12 August 1573). He joined the Northern Rebellion and had to flee England. * Frances Dacre (b. 1523) * Anne Dacre (1521- July 1581), married Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland by whom she had six children. * Dorothy Dacre (b. 1533), married Sir Thomas Windsor by whom she had one daughter, Anne Windsor. * George Dacre (b. 1534) * Eleanor Dacre, married Henry Jerningham, Esq., of Cotesby Hall by whom she had issue. * Mary Dacre (b. 1539), married Sir Alexander Culpepper of Bedgebury, by whom she had one son, Sir Anthony Culpepper of Bedgebury. * Edward Dacre (d. 1579). He joined his brother in the Northern Rebellion. * Sir Francis Dacre (d. 1632), married Dorothy Radcliffe by whom he had issue.  Marriage  Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, husband of Magdalen Dacre, in 1569 On 15 July 1558, Dacre married Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montagu, a Privy Counsellor, Knight of the Garter and King Philip's former Master of the Horse, in a ceremony took place at St. James's Palace. Browne was 10 years Magdalen's senior, aged 30 and a father and a widower from his previous marriage to Jane Radclyffe, who died due to childbirth, after the delivery of their twins, Mary and Anthony. Browne's links to the Queen were also impressive, and at Queen Mary's coronation, Browne carried the Queen's train.Carolly Erickson \\"Bloody Mary\\", p.294 Due to their links, Mary I attended the wedding. The Browne family, like the Dacres, were also staunch Catholics. Their principal residences were Cowdray Castle and Battle Abbey, both in Sussex. Anthony and Magdalen had ten children. Following the accession of Queen Elizabeth I to the throne in 1558, Montagu lost his seat on the Privy Council but was made joint Lord Lieutenant of Sussex in 1570. With the return to Protestant Christianity, the Montagus were forced to reveal their stance on the situation: loyalty to the Pope, or to the new Protestant Queen. Browne, along with Lord Dacre (Magdalen's brother), declared that they would support the Pope if he came in peace, but would serve the Queen if he came with war-like intentions. Magdalen found favour with the Queen despite her Catholicism, her former close friendship with the late Queen Mary and later the treacherous behaviour of her Dacre relations, some of whom conspired to depose the Queen and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. The Montagus entertained the Queen for a week at Cowdray Castle in 1591,Cowdray ruins: a short history and guide. and the priests were kept hidden during the visit.Emerson Magdalen was very devout and supposedly wore a coarse linen smock underneath her extravagant court costumes. Dacre was only once accused of recusancy, and although she allowed a printing press to be set up on her property, she refused to assist or abet treasonous plots against the Queen. Dacre died at Battle Abbey, Sussex on 8 April 1608 at the age of seventy.Worldroots.com She was originally buried in Midhurst Church, where a splendid tomb with her effigy was erected.

The Elpeus is a river that stems from a ravine on the lower banks of Mount Olympus in Greece, located approximately five miles from the city of Dion.Livy (trans. Henry Bettenson). Rome and the Mediterranean. Penguin Classics, 1976, . The river stream runs on a steep bank. In the summer months, the river all but dries up to a thin trickle, but, during the winter season, it regularly overflows. This results in the formation of strong whirlpools above its crags, while flowing down the eroded slopes of the mountain to the sea. These overflowings produce deep and wide chasms, with sheer slopes on either side. This makes the river very dangerous to cross and it is almost impassable during these months. The danger that the overflowing Elpeus river presents has been used tactically in warfare situations throughout history. During the Third Macedonian War, which started in 171 BC, Perseus of Macedon camped on a safe bank of the river, his intent being to use the flooded river as part of his defences. This particular position proved unassailable to his Roman enemies, who were, at the time, under the command of Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus. Paulus and his council spent much time deciding how to negotiate the river and breach Perseus' defences, some suggesting a counter-attack from behind Perseus camp and the river, while others recommended that a fleet be sent up the coast towards Thessalonica to draw the Macedonians out. Paulus ultimately decided to feint right and fool Perseus as to his intentions, while sending a force to the left and behind the river. The war ultimately resulted in Roman victory, in 168 BC, concluding at the Battle of Pydna.

Founded in 1933 by J. Gresham Machen, the IBPFM played a significant role in the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. The Independent Board continues under its founding charter, maintaining its original purpose of \\"promoting truly Biblical missions\\" consistent with Presbyterian doctrine and polity. The Board has approximately 30 missionaries in Central and South America, Kenya, Cambodia, and India. There are four full- time headquarters staff members in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania.IBPFM website History In 1932, the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions took an ambiguous position in regard to a theologically liberal report on missions, a decision that provided conservatives in the denomination further ammunition when one of the denomination's most prominent missionaries, the author Pearl S. Buck, endorsed the document as \\"masterly statement\\" and labeled traditional notions of salvation \\"superstitious.\\" The following year, conservative theologian J. Gresham Machen was instrumental in creating the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. Interpreting the existence of the new board as a direct challenge to its denominational authority, the Presbyterian Church brought the members of its board to trial‚Äîalthough Machen was never given the opportunity to defend his actions. In March 1935, the members of the Independent Board were found guilty and suspended from the ministry.D. G. Hart, Defending the Faith: J. Gresham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994), 147-156. In 1936, fundamentalists less concerned than Machen with the board's Presbyterian identity, ousted Machen as president and installed \\"a minister of a nondenominational church.\\"Hart, 163.

Life He was descended from the Scottish family of Phillip of Sanquhar, but nothing is known of his early life. Ordained in Rome, he returned in 1612 to Scotland where he was betrayed by his father, seized while saying Mass, and tried at Edinburgh as a seminary priest, 14 September 1613. The sentence of death was commuted to banishment. He withdrew to France, joining the French Oratory recently founded by Cardinal de B√©rulle. In 1628 he went to England as confessor to Queen Henrietta Maria. At her request he asked the pope for financial aid against the enemies of Charles I of England. The subsequent negotiations were discovered, and Phillip was impeached on the charge of being a papal spy and of having endeavoured to pervert Prince Charles, but proceedings dropped owing to the displeasure of Richelieu at the introduction of his own name into the matter. Later he was committed to the Tower of London for refusing to be sworn on the Anglican Bible on 2 November 1641, when he had been summoned by the House of Lords committee to be examined touching State matters. Released through the queen's influence, he accompanied her to The Hague in March, 1642, and remained with her in Paris till his death.

This gave him a key role in arresting wartime spies, and he was closely involved in the prosecution of Mata Hari, Sir Roger Casement and many Irish and Indian nationalists. His equating of Jews with Bolshevism led to accusations of anti-semitism. Thomson was also a successful novelist. Early life Thomson was born in Oxford, where his father, William Thomson (who would later become Archbishop of York), was provost of The Queen's College. Thomson was educated at Worsley's School in Hendon and Eton College, and then attended New College, Oxford where a fellow undergraduate was Montague John Druitt, the man named as the prime suspect in the Jack the Ripper case by Chief Constable Melville Macnaghten in a Scotland Yard document dated 1894. (Thomson replaced Macnaghten as Head of CID at Scotland Yard in 1913.) Thomson ended his university studies after two terms, after suffering bouts of depression, and spent some time from 1881 to 1882 in the United States, working as a farmer in Iowa.Noel Rutherford, Thomson, Sir Basil Home (1861‚Äì1939), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. Colonial service In 1883, with the promise of marriage to a Grace Webber should he be financially secure, Thomson secured a cadet position at the Colonial Office, where he assisted Sir William Des V≈ìux, then Governor of Fiji. Arriving in Fiji in early 1884, he set about learning the Fijian and Tongan languages while appointed as a stipendiary magistrate throughout the islands. When Sir William MacGregor was appointed administrator of British New Guinea, Thomson joined his staff until he was invalided back to England after contracting malaria. Back in England, Thomson married Grace Webber in 1890, returning to Fiji with his wife in the middle of that year to serve as commissioner of native lands. When Sir John Thurston, the Governor of Fiji, dismissed the Premier of Tonga (Shirley Waldemar Baker) in his capacity as High Commissioner of the Western Pacific, Thomson was moved to Tonga, where he became assistant premier to , the pro-British chief appointed as Baker's replacement. Writing career After three years at the Native Lands Office in Suva, Thomson resigned from colonial service, and returned to England in 1893, due in no small part to the deteriorating health of his wife. There he embarked on a career as a writer, drawing on his experiences in the South Sea Islands to produce South Sea Yarns (1894; written in Fiji), The Diversions of a Prime Minister (1894, about his government work in Tonga), and The Indiscretions of Lady Asenath (1898). Basil Thomson used his Fijian assistants to organise the first ever done census of Fijian marriage on Viti Levu. He found that the Fijians did not marry, as claimed in the specialised literature, their mother's brother's daughter, but married any girl and recalculated her kinship status after the marriage so as to address her by the term meaning mother's brother's daughter. This result was anathema to Radcliffe-Brown's anthropology school and was ignored. Later, L√©vi-Strauss would not take it into account either. But anthropologists of the time would not try to build any complete census of any culture trait. The result was that their material was partly insufficiently documented, but they would not recognise it, this ignorance continues to this day. Prison governorship In the mid-1890s, Thomson read for the bar examinations at the Inner Temple, and was admitted to the bar in 1896. Instead of becoming a barrister, Thomson accepted the position of deputy governor at HM Prison Liverpool, after his name was suggested for the post due to a personal acquaintance with Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, a fellow Old Etonian who had stayed with Thomson in Tonga. Over the next twelve years, he served as governor of Northampton, Cardiff, Dartmoor, and Wormwood Scrubs prisons. From 1908 to 1913, he served as secretary of the Prison Commission. In 1899, the United Kingdom and Germany signed an agreement formalising each country's rights and claims over Tonga and Samoa respectively. Given his inside knowledge of Tongan politics, Thomson was tasked with expediting the establishment of a British protectorate over Tonga, which was established on 18 May 1900 despite the objections of some native chiefs who wished to retain their traditional privileges. Metropolitan Police In June 1913, Thomson was appointed Assistant Commissioner \\"C\\" (Crime) of London's Metropolitan Police, which made him the head of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at New Scotland Yard. When World War I broke out in 1914, the CID found itself acting as the enforcement arm for Britain's military intelligence apparatus: while the newly formed Secret Service Bureau (later known as MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service), and the intelligence arms of the War Office and the Admiralty, collected intelligence on suspected spies in Britain, they had no arrest powers. As head of CID, Thomson was involved in the arrests in several high-profile espionage cases, including Lieutenant Carl Hans Lody and establishing himself a reputation as a \\"spycatcher\\". Thomson worked closely with the MI5, especially the MI5(g) headed by Vernon Kell and his work was key in dealing with the Indian nationalist movement in Europe. Since the existence of the latter organisation was not acknowledged at the time, Thomson controversially claimed a large proportion of the credit in the successful British counter-espionage operations. In his memoirs, The Scene Changes, Thomson acknowledges only the works of Robert Nathan, who worked closely with him, and was involved in the interrogation of a number of Indian revolutionaries who worked with German Intelligence during the war. Thomson and Nathan's work at the time was key in identifying the plans by Ghadar Party and the Indian Independence Committee to assassinate Lord Kitchener in 1915 through an associate of Har Dayal, Gobind Behari Lal, as well as identifying the outlines of the Indian revolutionary conspiracy. Their efforts at the time also resulted in the capture of Harish Chandra (who was associated with the Berlin committee), and he was successfully turned into a double agent. Thomson's efforts were also key in uncovering the first concrete evidence of Turco-German agents operating in the middle east and attempting to destabillise Afghanistan and British India. One who he interrogated was Mata Hari, the Dutch exotic dancer later to be executed by the French as a spy. In 1916 she was taken off a ship sailing from Spain to the Netherlands at Falmouth as a suspicious person and brought to London where she was interrogated at length by Thomson. Eventually she claimed to be doing some work for French Intelligence. (A full transcript of this is in Britain's National Archives and Thomson himself refers to it in his 1922 book Queer People). Thomson's work as Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard Involved a wide range of investigations. His natural conservatism was given full throttle against suffragettes, then against spies from Imperial Germany and its allies, then against Irish nationalists, and finally against British Marxists. Thomson was involved with the spreading of public awareness of the \\"Black Diaries\\" used against Sir Roger Casement to prevent public support for a reduction of Casement's death sentence for high treason in 1916. More controversially, the large number of Jews among the Bolsheviks before Stalin's purges led some to think he equated Bolshevism with Jews. He wrote anti- Semiticly shaded articles for a newspaper, the Whitechapel Gazette, owned by the highly questionable social figure Maundy Gregory. He burlesqued such views in his 1925 Sherlock Holmes spoof, \\"Mr Pepper Investigates\\", especially in Chapter 6, 'Blackmailers'. Thomson was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1916 and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1919. In 1919, while remaining Assistant Commissioner (Crime), he was appointed Director of Intelligence at the Home Office, in overall charge of every intelligence agency in the United Kingdom. From 30 April 1919 he issued a fortnightly Report on Revolutionary Organisations in the United Kingdom from his offices in Scotland House. One of Thomson's Irish agents John Charles Byrnes was a double agent within the IRA who identified Michael Collins but who was executed by the IRA in March 1920. In 1921 he fell out with Lloyd George and was asked to resign. The reasons for this remain mysterious. The Hyde Park incident In December 1925, Thomson was arrested in London's Hyde Park, and charged with \\"committing an act in violation of public decency\\" with a young woman, Miss Thelma de Lava. Thomson rejected the charges, insisting that he was engaged in conversation with the woman for the purposes of research for a book he was writing on London vice; found guilty of public indecency, he was fined ¬£5.The Thomson Case, TIME, 18 January 1926. The story he gave the court (which his barrister, Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, probably did not support) sounded totally peculiar. Thomson apparently lied (or told a half-truth) regarding his name, calling himself \\"Home Thomson\\" when he was arrested with Miss de Lava. \\"Home\\" was one of his middle names. Unfortunately he was recognised by the police. He tried alternately to bluster or to offer a vague bribe to the constables. When he presented his version in the courtroom he said he was researching a book on the danger of left wing agitators in England and he was together with Miss de Lava awaiting for the speech to begin. Had this been true, Thomson should have revealed in court who the orator was he was waiting for. He kept refusing, which with the background of Miss de Lava as a prostitute, forfeited the credibility that Thomson thought would save him. Family He was the father of Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Home Seymer DSO, MC (1894‚Äì1967), born Vivian Home Thomson, whose name was legally changed to Vivian Home Seymer by royal licence on 3 November 1919 .

Life and career  Cobb was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1944. His family later moved to Jacksonville, Florida. In 1953, at the age of nine, he and his two siblings were placed in the Baptist Children's Home in Jacksonville,Particulars of Florida Baptist Children's Home ‚Äì Jacksonville Campus ; www.fbchomes.org. Retrieved 2014-07-11. after his father left the family and his mother needed assistance. Cobb regarded the experience as positive, on balance, describing it as \\"the best and worst thing that could have happened to me. The best thing, because we would not have had anything at the time. The worst, it was scary not being a family anymore.\\" He regarded the experience as providing him with a strong work ethic, and remained in the home until the age of 16, graduating from Paxon High School in Jacksonville. One of Cobb's fellow graduates was drummer Robert Nix, who would later join with Cobb in forming the Atlanta Rhythm Section.Luc Brunot, Interview with Robert Nix, Bands of Dixie Magazine, November‚ÄìDecember 2008. Retrieved 2014-07-11. Following graduation from high school, Cobb became a welder. Co-workers had started a band called The Emeralds, and invited Cobb to join the band as a guitarist. The Emeralds evolved into The Classics, which then became The Classics IV, with lead singer Dennis Yost. The band was discovered by Paul Cochran, an associate of Atlanta music publisher Bill Lowery, who invited the band to Atlanta to record. Lowery also became the band's advisor. It was at his first recording sessions in Atlanta that Cobb met Buddy Buie, a producer and songwriter, who had been the former manager of Roy Orbison. Cobb and Buie developed a songwriting partnership, writing a number of their songs in a trailer owned by Buie's uncle near Lake Eufaula, bordering Georgia and Alabama. The two would fish during the day, and write at night. Their first hit was \\"I Take It Back\\", recorded by Sandy Posey. They then added lyrics to a local jazz song, which became the hit \\"Spooky\\", for the Classics IV, of which both Buie and Cobb were members. Cobb and Buie eventually co-wrote most of the hits for what became Dennis Yost & the Classics IV, including the 1968 gold single \\"Stormy.\\" Cobb later wrote or co-wrote a number of hits for the Atlanta Rhythm Section. In 1970, Cobb became a session guitarist in Doraville, Georgia at Studio One, playing in a session band with members of the Classics IV and The Candymen, which had been the backing band for Roy Orbison. The group became the Atlanta Rhythm Section, as named by Bill Lowery, and commenced recording as such as of 1972. Cobb left the group in 1987. He wished to concentrate on songwriting, as well as to work with Chips Moman, with whom he had first worked in Memphis, at Moman's American Sound Studio, which existed from 1967 to 1972. As of the mid-1970s, Moman had moved to Nashville. Subsequent to leaving the Atlanta Rhythm Section, Cobb worked with Moman as a session guitarist, as well as reviewing songs being sent to the studio. Cobb was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1993, and the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1997, where he received the Music Creator's Award.

It is a non-threatened species although it not commonly seen but it is however, becoming more and more popular in the exotic pet trade. In the Philippines, it is called Tabili in the Cebuano vernacular.  Names  It is known as 'kuka' in the Kotos Amarasi language of West Timor, Indonesia.LexiRumah 2.2.3, ‚Äòtokay gecko‚Äô/‚Äòtokek‚Äô.  Evolutionary genetics  Linkem, et al. (2013) found that the most divergent clades of L. smaragdina were in Sulawesi. Oceanic populations represent the most recent expansions. The origin of populations on most islands is attributed primarily to waif dispersals prior to human colonization, although human-aided dispersals cannot be ruled out for some populations.Charles W. Linkem, Rafe M. Brown, Cameron D. Siler, Ben J. Evans, Christopher C. Austin, Djoko T. Iskandar, Arvin C. Diesmos, Jatna Supriatna, Noviar Andayani and Jimmy A. McGuire.  Geographical distribution  It is found in arboreal forests of Taiwan, Palawan, Luzon and Sulu archipelagoes in the Philippines, New Guinea as well as the Indo-Australian archipelago and down south to the Solomon and Santa Cruz islands. The emerald tree skink is frequently found in palm plantations in disturbed coastal areas.  Feeding habits and diet  It is mostly carnivorous, feeding on insects and other small creatures, although occasionally it may devour fruit and leafy plants. In some areas, it even steals dog food.  Behavior  They prefer bare tree trunks without climbing plants. Several have even been sighted on minute islands with very little greenery, the record being four palm trees. It is a highly active species. Always on the move and is very squirmish, if handled. They are an unaggressive species and sometimes observed to form little groups to gang up on bigger prey.  Reproduction and breeding habits  Courtship ritual is the same as most lizards. It as an oviparous species meaning it lays eggs rather than bear live young like most members of the skink family do. Eggs are usually laid in clusters of two. They can be easily bred in captivity and may live an average 7‚Äì12 years in captivity.

By 1998, Sharrock was the drummer in Robbie Williams' band, a position he held for the next 8 years. Sharrock joined Oasis in 2008 after previous drummer Zak Starkey left the group. Chris did not play on the band's 2008 album, Dig Out Your Soul, but played on the subsequent tour. Noel Gallagher said in an interview for MOJO, regarding the appointment of Oasis' new drummer, \\"Liam is still not happy about Chris Sharrock, because he's Robbie Williams' drummer. I went home and thought about it and it was just too much of a temptation to piss Robbie Williams and Liam off in one phone call.\\"Noel‚Äôs double-whammy of new Oasis drummer, MusicRadar.com Michael Leonard, 10 July 2008. Sharrock made his live debut with Oasis on 14 August 2008, in front of 150 Oasis fan club members. Sharrock became well-known to Oasis fans for his drum solo during the song \\"The Shock of the Lightning\\" which he performed several times whilst touring with Oasis during 2008 and 2009. As well, he was noted for his flamboyant tricks with his drumsticks, including twirling them during the intro to \\"Morning Glory\\" and throwing them up in the air now and again, much to the crowd's enjoyment. In an interview given during the South American tour of 2009 (posted by Noel on the Official Oasis Blog), Noel Gallagher, asked to compare the drumming prowess of Chris Sharrock and Zak Starkey, stated that they are both the same. Starkey and Sharrock have an extremely similar history, very often taking over from each other; Sharrock was Starkey's predecessor as the drummer for both the Icicle Works and the Lightning Seeds. After Oasis split in 2009, Sharrock formed Beady Eye with former bandmates Liam Gallagher, Gem Archer, and Andy Bell. He would be featured on their two studio albums Different Gear, Still Speeding and BE. When Beady Eye disbanded, Sharrock joined the touring band for Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, who were promoting the album Chasing Yesterday. Along with his former bandmate Archer, Sharrock was announced as a full-time member for Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds during the 2017 recording sessions of Who Built The Moon? Sharrock did not, however, appear on the album in any capacity.

Explore Learning is a British company founded in 2001 to provide private learning centres located across the UK. The centres are located in places easy for families to attend on a regular basis, such as Sainsbury's supermarkets, shopping centres and local high streets. Its first centre was opened in Chelmsford in October 2001, and since then Explore Learning has expanded to over 124 centres across the UK as of February 2017. In March 2014, Explore Learning launched its American sister company, called Explore Horizons, in Colleyville, Texas. They have a rapidly expanding membership across their five centers in Alliance, Colleyville, Garland, Frisco and Plano. It was first started for children with a problem like autism.  Method of learning  Explore Learning centres provide Maths and English tuition, with tutors working in a low ratio with children to meet their individual needs. The sessions are designed to be a complement to children‚Äôs school experience, and they feed back into the classroom environment. The maximum ratio is 1 tutor to 6 children. The tuition sessions aim to boost confidence, enthusiasm and independence into a child‚Äôs development. In addition to the core maths and English tuition, Explore also offers a bespoke course to support children preparing for the 11 Plus and entrance exams. The teaching materials are mapped to the English, Welsh and Northern Irish National Curriculum and the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence. The tutors develop relationships with local schools and are involved in school life by running regular maths and English workshops for pupils. They are also involved in running local community activities such as providing story-based workshops in local libraries. Children are assessed in their level of learning and so that the curriculum can be tailored to each child. This allows Explore to support children of all abilities, whether gifted and talented, looking for a confidence boost or those with special educational needs. The centres use SuccessMaker and Digitexts software in addition to written materials to provide hour-long sessions, and children can earn prizes. Typically, children become members and attend sessions once or twice a week, with each session lasting approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. The monthly membership fee is subject to some regional variations, which entitles each child to a maximum of two visits a week. Feedback is provided on progress at the end of each session and each child receives a chart summarising the lesson. These charts give examples of the activities completed, and comments from the tutors. Parent Conferences are also available to discuss each child‚Äôs progress and review their goals in more detail.  Explore Learning centres  Explore Learning opened its first centre in Chelmsford in October 2001, and has now expanded to over 120 centres nationwide as of April 2016. The centres are vibrant and energetic environments for children to learn and feel at home. The centres are usually open seven days a week both in term time and during school holidays. The membership is flexible and children are not required to book their places in advance. All of the Explore Learning centres are Ofsted/Care Commission registered and inspected. This means that Explore membership qualifies for a number of government initiatives including the Childcare Vouchers scheme, Accor, Allsave, Busy Bees, Care4, Faircare, Imagine, Leapfrog and Sodexho Pass. Members are also eligible for claims up to 70% of the costs if they are within the ‚Äòchild care element‚Äô of the Working Tax Credit. Explore Learning also offer scholarship places to support lower income families who qualify for either Income Support or Income-Based Jobseeker's Allowance.  Awards  Explore Learning was named Supplementary Education Provider of the Year in 2011 and 2012 in the Education Investor Awards, and won the Private Tuition Centre Operator award in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Explore Learning was also named in The Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For in 2016, and was the fourth time the company has been given this prestigious award.  Explore Learning tutors  Explore managers and tutors are trained to become experts in the curriculum and are knowledgeable about current teaching methods. Unlike many other tutoring companies, Explore does not operate a franchise model and directly recruits and trains all staff. Explore tutors work with children in a low ratio (a maximum of 1:6), ensuring the right balance between individual support and independent learning. As children practise and acquire new skills throughout the learning session, the tutors are on hand to encourage, explain or suggest a new approach.

Life He was born at or near Ripon and arrived at the English College, Reims, 17 April 1589. He received the first tonsure and minor orders 18 August 1590, the subdiaconate at Laon on 22 September, and the diaconate and priesthood at Soissons on 30 and 31 March 1591. He left for England on the following 15 May. He was arrested about 1 May 1598, when on his way to York with Ralph Grimston of Nidd. Both were shortly after condemned, Snow of treason as being a priest and Grimston of felony, for having aided and assisted him, and, it is said, having attempted to prevent his apprehension. Relics in Leeds Cathedral In 1845, two skulls were discovered under the stone floor of the ancient chapel of Hazlewood Castle, near Tadcaster. At the time they were thought to be relics of two other English martyrs, John Lockwood and Edmund Catherick and the skulls were placed in a niche near the altar. In 1909, it was stated that they were the relics of Peter Snow and Ralph Grimston. This identification was accepted. In 2005, Arthur Roche, Bishop of Leeds, decided to place relics in Leeds Cathedral altar. He ordered reconstruction of their faces using the latest techniques from the University of Dundee. The reconstructed face pictures of Blessed Fr.Peter Snow and Ralph Grimston can be found on Leeds Cathedral webpage. The story of reconstraction was covered in BBC's Inside Out.

It stretches 212 km from north to south and 153 km from east to west. Location and description 1916 map of Tirari Desert and environs. (Note:the desert is not labelled or delineated) The Tirari Desert features salt lakes and large north‚Äìsouth running sand dunes. It is located partly within the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park. It lies mainly to the east of Lake Eyre North. Cooper Creek runs through the centre of the desert. The adjacent deserts of the area include Simpson Desert which lies to the north while the Strzelecki Desert is to the east and the Sturt Stony Desert runs aligned with the Birdsville track to the north east. The desert experiences harsh conditions with high temperatures and very low rainfall (mean annual rainfall is below ). =Access and stations= The main vehicular access to the desert is via the unpaved Birdsville Track which runs northwards from Marree to Birdsville. The Mungerannie Hotel is the only location between the two towns that provides services. The Tirari Desert region has a number of large cattle stations which are stopping points on the Channel Country aviation mail run. Dulkaninna Station has been run by the same family for 110 years, has 2,000 cattle and breeds horses and kelpies. Etadunna Station to the north is a cattle station with 2500 cattle. The station environs include a number of heritage sites include Bucaltaninna Homestead ruins, the Woolshed ruins and Canny Trig Point (also known as Milner's Pile) and the state heritage-registered Killalpaninna Mission site. Further north again is Mulka Station which also has a number of heritage sites including homestead ruins at Apatoongannie, Old Mulka and Ooroowillannie. The Mulka Store ruins is listed as a state heritage place on the South Australian Heritage Register. Vegetation South-west parts of the Tirari Desert, 29 July 1999 The vegetation of the dunefields of the Tirari Desert is dominated by either Sandhill Wattle (Acacia ligulata) or Sandhill Cane-grass (Zygochloa paradoxa) which occur on the crests and slopes of dunes. Tall, open shrubland also occurs on the slopes. The otherwise sparsely vegetated dunefields become covered by a carpet of grasses, herbs and colourful flowering plants following rains. The interdune soil types and hence the vegetation, varies with the dune spacing. Closer spaced dunes result in sandy valleys that have similar vegetation to the dune sides while widely spaced dunes are separated by gibber or flood plains, each supporting particular vegetation communities. The vegetation on the floodplains varies with the capacity of the land to retain floodwaters, and the frequency of inundation. In drier areas, species including Old Man Saltbush (Atriplex nummularia), Cottonbush (Maireana aphylla) and Queensland Bluebush (Chenopodium auricomum) form a sparse, open shrubland, whereas swamps and depressions are frequently associated with Swamp Cane-grass (Eragrostis australasica) and Lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta). The intermittent watercourses and permanent waterholes associated with tributaries of Cooper Creek support woodland dominated by River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and Coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah). As at 2008, the Tirari Desert is included in biogeographic regions (IBRA) SSD3: Dieri, part of the Simpson Strzelecki Dunefields (SSD) Region. The desert is also part of the Tirari-Sturt stony desert ecoregion. Fossils The desert includes the Lake Ngapakaldi to Lake Palankarinna Fossil Area, a area on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate with significant Tertiary period vertebrate fossils. History Tirarai Desert from Southern edge bank of Cooper Creek on Birdsville Track showing old punt for crossing during flood The area was first explored by Europeans in 1866 and was previously settled by a small tribe of Aboriginals, the Tirari. =Dieri people= The Tirari Desert has been part of the Dieri people's native title claim.South Australia native title claim. Edward Landers (2001)Dieri People native title claim[cartographic material] : NNTT SC97/004 and Federal Court SG6017/1998. South Australia. Dept. for Environment and Heritage.

The Australian anthropologist Norman Tindale reported a small tribe now extinct which he referred to as the Tirari. They were located at the eastern shore of Lake Eyre from Muloorina north to Warburton River; east to Killalapaninna. Tindale disagreed with the earlier findings of Alfred William Howitt that these people were a horde of the Dieri as the language spoken was different from Dieri. Since Tindale's work was published, much of the data relating to Aboriginal language group distribution and definition has undergone revision since 1974. Tindale's focus was to depict Aboriginal tribal distribution at the time of European contact. =Missions= In the 1860s two Aboriginal missions were established near the Cooper Creek crossing of the Birdsville Track. The Moravians established a short-lived mission at Lake Kopperamanna in 1866. This was closed in 1869 due to drought conditions and poor relations with the local indigenous community. Bethesda Mission was established by German Lutherans at nearby Lake Killalpaninna around the same period and, after also being abandoned for a short time, was re-established and by the 1880s it resembled a small town with more than 20 dwellings including a church. At this time, it had a population of \\"several hundred aborigines and a dozen whites\\". Primarily financed by sheep grazing, the mission closed in 1917 due to the effects of drought and rabbit plagues. Currently, there is little evidence of the settlement other than a small cemetery and some remnant timber posts. The mission remains are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as the Killalpaninna Mission Site. =European exploration= On an 1866 expedition to determine the northern limit of Lake Eyre, Peter Egerton Warburton approached the desert from the west and followed the upstream course of what is now known as the Warburton River, but which he incorrectly believed was Cooper Creek. In 1874 another expedition, led by James William Lewis, again followed the river upstream to the Queensland border, retracing the route on the return journey and then headed south to the Kopperamanna mission. Subsequently, they followed the course of Cooper Creek to conduct a survey of the east shore of Lake Eyre. Lewis, in a later account of his expedition, said of the lake \\"I sincerely trust I may never see it again; it is useless in every respect, and the very sight of it creates thirst in man and beast.\\" See also * Deserts of Australia * Lake Eyre Basin * List of deserts by area ReferencesExternal links *Map of Tirari Desert *Online Natural History of Tirari Desert *Tirari Desert SA @ ExplorOz Category:Deserts of South Australia Category:Far North (South Australia) Category:Lake Eyre basin Category:IBRA subregions ","title":"Tirari Desert"},{"id":"18072703","text":"Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Larkin (26 July 1905 ‚Äì 19 September 1976) was an Irish hurler who played as a full-back for the Kilkenny senior team.

He won his first Leinster title in 1931 following a victory over Laois in the provincial final. Larkin later lined out in his first All-Ireland final with Cork providing the opposition. The low-scoring game ended in a draw ‚Äì 1‚Äì6 apiece. Four weeks later the two times met again for the replay. In a similar pattern Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back to equalise. At the final whistle both sides finished with 2‚Äì5. The third game of the series took place in the first week of November, however, on this occasion there would be a winner as Cork sealed the victory by 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì4. In 1932 Larkin captured a second Leinster title as Dublin were defeated in the provincial final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on Clare. It was the first ever meeting of these two teams in the history of the championship. In a close and exciting match Kilkenny took the lead thanks to goals by Matty Power, Lory Meagher and Martin White. Clare fought back, however, Kilkenny hung on to win the game by 3‚Äì3 to 2‚Äì3 giving Larkin his first All-Ireland medal. Larkin won a National Hurling League medal at the start of 1933 before helping Kilkenny to retain their provincial dominance in with a defeat of Dublin, giving Larkin a third Leinster medal. A defeat of Galway in the next game set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Limerick. In another tight game Kilkenny sealed the victory with a 1‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì6 score line giving Larkin his second consecutive All-Ireland title. Kilkenny lost their provincial title in 1934, however, Power won a fourth Leinster medal in 1935. The All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny take on Limerick for the second time in three years. Once again the match was a close one, however, Kilkenny clung on and won by a single point ‚Äì 2‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì4. It was Larkin's third victory in an All-Ireland final. In 1936 Larkin was appointed captain of the Kilkenny team. That year he guided his team to another Leinster final victory over Laois, his fifth winners' medal in all, before lining out in yet another All-Ireland final. Once again, the two outstanding teams of the decade, Kilkenny and Limerick, were paired together in the championship decider. Limerick were coming into their prime at this stage and gained revenge for the defeats of 1933 and 1935 by trouncing 'the Cats' on a score line of 5‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì5. Kilkenny bounced back in 1937 with Larkin adding a sixth Leinster title to his collection. The All-Ireland final pitted Kilkenny against Tipperary in the unusual venue of FitzGerald Stadium in Killarney. 'The Cats' were definitely on a downward spiral by this stage as they were walloped by 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì3. Larkin was appointed captain of Kilkenny for the second time in 1938, however, Dublin accounted for his team in the Leinster final. In 1939 'the Cats' reclaimed their provincial crown with a victory over All-Ireland champions Dublin. It was Larkin's seventh provincial medal of the decade. The subsequent All-Ireland final against Cork has gone down in history as the famous 'thunder and lightning' final when a huge downpour interrupted play. In the end victory went to Kilkenny by a single point. It was not the last time that 'the Cats' would defeat 'the Rebels' by a single point in a final. It was Larkin's fourth All-Ireland medal. In 1940 Larkin added an eighth Leinster medal to his collection after another defeat of Dublin. The All-Ireland final saw Kilkenny and Limerick, the two dominant teams of the last decade, take to the field for one final game. Kilkenny had peaked in the final the year before while Limerick were now reaching their prime. A 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì7 defeat for Kilkenny resulted in Larkin ending up on the losing side for the fourth time. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the county hampered Kilkenny's championship hopes for the next few seasons. In spite of this the team bounced back in 1943 with Larkin adding a ninth Leinster medal to his already impressive collection. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final provided what was regarded as the time as the biggest shock in the history of the championship. Antrim had defeated Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final in, what was described as, a fluke. Antrim proved that their victory was far from lucky as they defeated Larkin's side in the subsequent semi-final. This marked one of Larkin's last appearances for Kilkenny as he retired from inter-county hurling shortly after. =Provincial= Larkin also lined out with Leinster in the early years of the inter-provincial hurling championship. He first lined out for his province in 1932 and captured his first Railway Cup medal following a victory over Munster. Larkin won a second Railway Cup title in 1933; however, Munster reclaimed the title in 1934 and 1935. In 1936 Larkin was captain of Leinster as he collected his third Railway Cup memento. It was his last medal with his province; however, he continued playing until 1939.

After his death during the World Exhibition in Paris, his collection of sculptures by Auguste Rodin, and painters like Giovanni Segantini, was legated to the National Gallery (Berlin). Felix as a banker and collector was an example for Franz Koenigs. Together in Paris, Franz collected at the age of 17, his first Jean-Fran√ßois-Millet drawing, the start of his Modern Art Collection.

Still in the old building of Museum Boijmans 'Het Schielandhuis' Franz Koenigs showed in 1934 his Dutch drawings from the 15th, 16th and 17th century.Catalogue to the exhibition 'Nederlandse Teekeningen uit de 15de, 16de en 17de eeuw uit de verzameling F. Koenigs, Museum Boijmans' At the end of the year, December 1934 till January 1935 Catalogue to the exhibition 'Honderd Fransche Teekeningen uit de verzameling F. Koenigs', Museum Boijmans' the Boijmans exhibited hundred French Drawings from the F. Koenigs Collection when the new museum building was ending its final stage of construction. As a patron of the Arts Franz Koenigs was looking for a museum to house his Collection of Old Master Paintings, consisting of 46 paintings of which 20 were by Rubens and 4 by Jheronimus Bosch and his Old Master Drawing Collection consisting of 2144 Drawings. In April 1935 it was announced that Franz Koenigs would lent his Old Master Painting Collection and his Old Master Drawing Collection, for a minimal period of 10 years to the new Museum Boijmans.http://www.standsarchiefrotterdam.nl/museum-Boijmans-van- Beuningen Standstill Agreements In 1931, the German crisis effected Rhodius Koenigs, through its partnership with Delbr√ºck Schickler and Delbr√ºck von der Heydt, in such that the DANAT (Darmst√§dter National Bank) went concourse. The Germans announced the \\"Stillhalte abkommen\\" the Standstill agreements, which was followed by the English moratorium. Germany was no longer able nor willing to further pay the reparation payments of the Clemenceau agreement. On June 20, 1931 President Hoover put a one-year moratorium on payments of World War I. The Delbr√ºck Banks through Rhodius Koenigs had outstanding orders in Britain, which were regarded as reparation payments of World War I. Those outstanding orders could no longer be paid for in Britain nor could the goods be delivered to Germany, which blocked Rhodius Koenigs trading. To circumvent Rhodius Koenigs liquidity, Franz Koenigs enlarged Rhodius Koenigs Banks Capital. Lisser & Rosenkranz, Tillmann and Altmann, Jewish owned Banks from Hamburg, opted to participate in Rhodius Koenigs capital expansion. The Capital restrictions was the underlying reason why the Jewish Banks participation was not in shares but a loan of liquid assets. The loan thus served two purposes, it allowed the German Jewish investors to circumvent the restrictions on financial investments outside Germany and it provided Rhodius Koenigs with liquidity.Dr. H.B. Junz \\"The case of Franz Koenigs 2012-10-31\\" To ensure the liquid assets provided by the Jewish Banks, Franz Koenigs used his collection as security. In 1937, Franz and Anna Koenigs, lost their eldest son, Ernst Magnus Koenigs(31-5-1916 Berlin, 1937 in Spain) in the Spanish Civil War fighting Franco. While studying in England, Ernst was recruited by the P.O.U.M. Militia. He was only 20 years of age and in order to register he needed to falsify his identity. He took on the name Erwin Krause.The RKD, The Hague, Archive 0859/107 It has been acknowledged though without any concrete proof, that Ernst was shot while flying over Barcelona.Testimony Lili Gutmann a friend of Ernst and the Koenigs family. Actively fighting Franco was the same as fighting the Nazi-regime and considered high treason. Therefore, Ernst death had to remain a secret. Franz Koenigs in reaction to his sons loss, trying to save what was left of his family, applied for Dutch citizenship. Two years later on February 9, 1939, Dutch citizenship was granted.National Archives, The Hague; Archive Staten Generaal, Kamerstuk Tweede Kamer 1938-1939 kamerstuknummer 239 onder nummer 1, Koninklijke Boodschap http://www.statengeneraaldigitaal.nl At that time, with the staggering number of Jews fleeing Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Sudetenland, Bohemia, Moravia and Germany it was hard to obtain Dutch citizenshipLynn Nicholas; 'Cruel World: the children of Europe in the Nazi web' Chapter 'The Flood Gates Close'publ. by Alfred A. Knopf 2005, distributed by Random House For Franz Koenigs and his family to obtain the much desired Dutch passports, his loan of the Collection F. Koenigs to Museum Boijmans was brought forward as an important contribution to Dutch Cultural Society. Franz Koenigs by obtaining Dutch citizenship thus took a next step in saving his family and his art-collections from the Nazi-regime, in particularly from Hitler who at that time was the world's foremost art buyer. In 1941 Franz Koenigs fell from a train platform at Cologne station in front of a train and died. At present descendants believe that the Nazis murdered him by throwing him under a train. He collected an impressive number of Old Master Drawings, and Paintings since 1935 on loan at the Boijmans Museum. The collection was known as the F. Koenigs collection. Especially the quality of his Old Masters, caused high ranking on Hitlers desiderata list. On April 2, 1940, the Jewish owned bank Lisser & Rosenkranz liquidated in order to be insolvent before the Nazi invasion. Due to the thread of an acute invasion the Jewish owned bank sold the collection for a fraction of its worth to one of the patrons of the museum Boijmans. On 3 December 1940 Van Beuningen concluded the sale of a fifth of the drawing collection, to be precise Van Beuningen sold 528 Franz Koenigs drawings for 1.5 Mio to Hitler through Hans Posse who acted for the collection for the F√ºhrermuseum in Linz. During the war, the Allies agreed on the Joint Declaration that all transactions between the occupied countries and the German occupier would be invalid, and that all art should be returned to the country of origin and hence to the original owner. Soviet troops looted the art collection after the war and transported it to the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities denied for a long time that they had the art collection. However, in the nineties, it became clear that Soviet troops had looted the art collection. The major part of the collection was exhibited in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and a minor part in Kiev. Honoring the request of the Dutch government, the Ukrainian authorities returned the part of the collection that was in Kiev. More than 300 drawings from the same collection were traced to Moscow 10 years ago, but Russia has so far refused to hand them back.

Founded in 1920, it is the second oldest veterinary faculty in Africa. About Veterinary Science Retrieved 9 November 2011 With the exception of the faculties in Khartoum (Sudan, 1938), and Cairo (Egypt, 1946), all the other African faculties were established after 1960. It is the only one of its kind in South Africa and is one of 33 veterinary faculties in Africa. Since 1997, the university as a whole has produced more research outputs every year than any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, as measured by the Department of Education's accreditation benchmark. The Faculty offers an undergraduate veterinary degree programme and a veterinary nursing diploma programme as well as a variety of postgraduate degree programmes. Graduates of the Faculty enjoy national and international recognition and the BVSc degree of the University of Pretoria currently enjoys recognition for registration by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) in the UK, the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council (AVBC) in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania as well as by the relevant authorities in Malaysia.  History  The first Colonial Veterinary Surgeon in South Africa was appointed in approximately 1874 in Port Natal (present day Durban in KwaZulu-Natal), followed by the appointment of the first Colonial Veterinary Surgeon in the Cape Colony in 1876 and the subsequent arrival of private practitioners in the late 19th century. A major event was the arrival in 1891 of a Swiss-born veterinarian, Arnold Theiler, who went on to establish a disinfection station and vaccine factory at Daspoort close to Pretoria in 1898, to produce vaccines and conduct research. In March 1898, Theiler was appointed director of the Bacterial Institute at Daspoort. Despite the unhealthiness of the site, and the very inadequate facilities consisting of wood-and iron buildings and stables, an enormous amount of valuable research work was produced at Daspoort. When this facility became unsuitable in 1905, Theiler was instrumental in establishing a new facility at Onderstepoort in 1908, which became the current Agricultural Research Council's Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. The sum of 40 000 pounds was voted for this purpose. A new site was selected on the farm De Onderstepoort, 11 km north of Church Square, because of its central position near the seat of government in Pretoria, its proximity to main railway lines, and satisfactory climate for human health. It is also an area where diseases such as horse sickness and bluetongue which were being investigated, were prevalent. The new laboratory building which is still known as the \\"Main Building\\", the quadrangle of stables behind it, and other necessary facilities and staff houses were completed and ready for occupation by October 1908. During this time and in the years thereafter, the possibility of training veterinarians in South Africa was frequently raised but it was not until 1920 that Sir Arnold Theiler was appointed as Director of Veterinary Education and Research. He served as the first Dean of veterinary science at \\"Onderstepoort\\" under the supervision of the then Transvaal University College. New facilities were inaugurated at the end of 1921 and the first residence was opened in 1924. The first eight South African trained veterinarians qualified in 1924. When the Union of South Africa was formed from the provinces of the Transvaal, Natal, the Cape Province and the Orange Free State in 1910, Onderstepoort became the headquarters of veterinary research for the whole country. The initial intakes were small and the number of veterinarians graduating from the Faculty every year remained below 20 until 1956. The first batch of graduates to exceed 40 in number, qualified in 1967. The numbers fluctuated around the 40 mark until 1978 and was followed by the first large batch of graduates in 1979 (69) following an increase in the intake of second year students in 1976. The intake was increased to 120 per annum in 2000 and to 135 in 2005. The Faculty was the only one of its kind in South Africa until 1980 when a second Faculty of Veterinary Science was established within the Medical University of South Africa (MEDUNSA). This Faculty admitted its first students in 1982, produced its first graduates in 1987 and was amalgamated with the Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria in 1999. The new National Faculty created in this way continues to use the facilities of the Onderstepoort campus of the University of Pretoria and continues to function as a fully-fledged faculty of the University of Pretoria. It is once again the only one of its kind in South Africa. Facilities The Faculty of Veterinary Science is situated at Onderstepoort in the north of Pretoria which is a property of 65 hectares. Onderstepoort is a generic name for a hub of three institutions in the vicinity, namely the Faculty, Onderstepoort Biological Products (OBP) and the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI). All three institutions are independent. The Onderstepoort campus of the University is 30 km north west of the main campus in Hatfield and 15 km north of the city center of Pretoria. The buildings on the Onderstepoort campus cover a total of 55 000 m^2 and consist of the following: * The Arnold Theiler building * The Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital (OVAH) * Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases and support services of the central Department of Education Innovation * Department of Anatomy and Physiology (sections of Anatomy and Histology, including electron microscopy) * Departments of Anatomy and Physiology (section of Physiology), Centre for Veterinary Wildlife Studies * Department of Production Animal Studies * Department of Paraclinical Sciences (sections of Veterinary Public Health and Pathology) * Equine Research Centre * Camps, paddocks and animal handling facilities (including a small dairy) managed by the Onderstepoort Animal Teaching Unit (OTAU) * Residence annexes * Student residence and associated sports fields * Biomedical Research Centre (UPBRC) Sir Arnold Theiler Building Departments The faculty has 5 academic departments responsible for teaching, research and service rendering. These activities are further facilitated by well developed support services provided by an academic hospital, various departmental laboratories, general and student administrative sections, a teaching animal unit and a number of research centres. The Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital provides clinical services rendered with full student participation as part of the primary teaching mission of the Faculty of Veterinary Science. =Anatomy and physiology= The Anatomy Section is responsible for teaching undergraduate- and postgraduate macroscopical and microscopical anatomy to veterinary science and nursing students. The undergraduate teaching programme includes the Electron Microscope Unit canine anatomy presented to the BSc (VetBiol) III students and comparative anatomy of equine, ruminants, porcine, birds and fish presented to the BVSc I students. MSc and PhD programmes in veterinary anatomy are presented in the department. Various postgraduate anatomy courses are also presented to students registered for the specialist MMedVet degree. The main focus of research in the department is on the anatomy of wild animals and the reproductive biology of birds and mammals. The Veterinary Physiology Section is responsible for teaching and research in basic and applied physiology and physiological chemistry. A complete course in fundamental animal physiology and physiological chemistry is taught in the VAP 300 module presented to the BSc (VetBiol) III students, followed by a course in Applied Physiology in the BVSc I year. It is problem-based and focuses the student on the holistic approach to treating the whole animal. The Section also teaches a fundamental course in Physiology and Physiological Chemistry to the first-year DipVet student nurses. Research areas are focused upon metabolic adaptation of indigenous sheep and goats, water and electrolyte balance in sheep, and certain facets of nanotechnology. =Companion animal clinical studies= The Department of Companion Animal Clinical Studies is responsible for teaching, service rendering and research in the disciplines of Anaesthesiology, Clinical Pathology, Dentistry, Diagnostic Imaging, Ophthalmology, Equine Medicine & Surgery, and Small Animal Medicine & Surgery. =Paraclinical sciences= The Department of Paraclinical Sciences is one of five academic departments of the Faculty of Veterinary Science. The Department was formed in May 2001 following restructuring at the Faculty. The Department comprises four sections representing the primary disciplines of Pathology, Pharmacology, Toxicology and Veterinary Public Health. The Phytomedicine programme is also hosted in the Department. While each individual section is responsible for the maintenance and development of their respective disciplines, they function as a unit in pursuing the Departmental mission. =Production animal studies= The Department of Production Animal Studies is subdivided according to activities. These divisions are: * The Animal Production and Ethology Section is responsible for the presentation of courses in basic animal production, welfare and animal handling * The Epidemiology Section deals with all aspects of veterinary epidemiology * The Herd Health Section visits various production animal farms and empowers students to practice preventive medicine * The Production Animal Clinical Section takes care of the medical and surgical production animal cases in the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital and surrounding communities * The Reproduction section teaches students about reproductive disorders and biotechnology in all species. Specialists in the section supply a service to farmers and breeders * The Poultry Reference Centre deals with all aspects of poultry health and production in close association with the poultry industry =Veterinary tropical diseases= In the domain of Tropical Animal Health, the Department of Veterinary Tropical Diseases (DVTD) is well positioned to play a leading role, especially in research and the training of postgraduate students of the region and further afield. Research There are four main research centres within the faculty: * Centre for Veterinary Wildlife Studies * Equine Research Centre * Veterinary Pharmacovigilance Centre * UP Biomedical Research Centre Academic programmes The Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria offers a BVSc degree which is recognised by the South African Veterinary Council for registration as Veterinarian which entitles the holder to practice as a veterinarian. It is also recognised as such by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) in the UK, the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council (AVBC) in Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania as well as by the relevant authorities in Malaysia. It also offer a University Diploma in Veterinary Nursing (DipVetNurs; also referred to as DVN) which is recognised by the South African Veterinary Council for registration as Veterinary Nurse which entitles the holder to practise the profession of veterinary nursing. The faculty also offers a number of postgraduate courses including BVSc Honours, MMedVet, MSc, PhD and DVSc courses. The undergraduate veterinary programme has developed from the original 5-year programme to a five-and-a- half year programme in the mid 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. It was changed to a 6-year programme in the late 1990s and to a split degree structure consisting of a 3-year BSc (Veterinary Biology) degree and 4-year BVSc degree in 2003. Since 2011, students who are already enrolled in the programme will need 3 years to complete the BSc (Veterinary Biology) degree and another 4 years for the 4-year BVSc degree; a total of 7 years. Students who will be admitted to the new degree programme from 2011 onwards will need only 6 years to complete the programme. The first 2 ‚Äì 3 cohorts of students in the new programme will also take 7 years to complete the programme due to transitional arrangements. The academic activities of the Faculty of Veterinary Science usually commence early in January each year and end towards the second half of November. Academic semesters are of equal length (approximately 14 weeks) with recesses during Easter, July and December. =DipVetNurs= The diploma programme requires two years of full-time study at the Onderstepoort campus of the University of Pretoria. The first year is devoted to more basic courses in Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology, Ethology, Microbiology, Parasitology, Laboratory Technique and General Nursing. It also includes promotion courses in Medical Nursing, Reproductive Nursing and Theatre Practice. The second year is devoted to Medical Nursing, Reproductive Nursing, Theatre Practice, Anaesthesiology, Radiography and Surgical Nursing. It also includes a lecture- free semester of clinical training in the Academic Hospital and approved private veterinary facilities. An Academic Information Week is offered at the beginning of the academic year for all new students and includes a life skills course. Attendance is compulsory. The addition of a further year of study and converting the diploma programme into a degree programme is currently under consideration. =BVSc= Existing (old) degree This programme, which followed on the completion of the BSc (Veterinary Biology) degree programme, will be presented for the last time from 2012 ‚Äì 2015. It will be sequentially phased out as students progress through the various years of study. New degree A new core-elective degree programme has been developed to replace the previous programme. It was introduced in 2011 and is an internationally recognised and recommended approach and will continue to allow graduates to register and work as veterinarians in South Africa. With the exception of the first year of study, which is offered on the Hatfield campus, it will be offered on a full-time basis on the Onderstepoort campus of the University of Pretoria. The first semester of the first year of study will consist of the same modules as those originally found in the BSc (Veterinary Biology) programme and currently in the BSc (Agric)(Animal Science / Biological Science) programmes. One exception is the addition of Medical Terminology. This trend will be continued in the second semester although some modules will be excluded in favour of new modules in Animal Nutrition, Introductory Animal Production and Professional Life. The latter will run throughout the programme and concentrate on the soft skills and ethical and professional aspects of the veterinary profession. From the second year of study, the programme will be presented on the Onderstepoort campus of the University. It will deal exclusively with basic veterinary disciplines such as Anatomy, Histology, Microbiology and Physiology as well as modules in Animal Science, Pasture Science and Professional Life. The third year will be devoted to the causes and effects of disease and will include modules on Infectious Diseases, Parasitology, Toxicology, Pharmacology, Organ Pathology and Professional Life. In the fourth year, the student will be introduced to modules aimed at diagnostics and therapeutics and in the first semester of the fifth year with community interaction. Specific species-directed modules in these semesters will also be presented. In the second semester of the fifth year the emphasis will be on the didactic components of the elective modules chosen by students. The remaining approximately 12 months will be devoted to experiential training in the core and elective components in the academic hospital as well as in satellite and other approved facilities. BVSc(Hons) The honours degree provides the student with a broad scientific background in the theoretical aspects of the modules offered. A selection of related modules is required to the value of 120 SAQA credits (24 to 30 faculty credits in the current credit- rating system). The knowledge gained in this degree programme can be applied in general practice and Faculty credits earned may be recognised for a period of two years in a subsequent MMedVet degree programme. Conferment of the honours degree is not subject to future registration in the master's degree programme. The modules are classified on a general, discipline-based and species-based basis and there are no restrictions in terms of credits in these categories. Modules offered in other Faculties of the University may also be included if approved. MMedVet The master's degree in Veterinary Medicine is a professional specialist degree which equips the student with a broad scientific background in the theoretical aspects of the discipline and provides specific skills and competencies in the chosen specialty. Holders of the degree are registerable with the South African Veterinary Council as specialists provided they are also registerable as veterinarians. The programme covers theoretical and practical training in the chosen specialty and requires the completion of a research project and submission of a dissertation. A module in research methodology is compulsory. Some of the programmes are recognised as suitable programmes for preparation for overseas diplomate college examinations. Selection procedures The Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria is unique in the sense that it is the only faculty that trains veterinarians and veterinary nurses in South Africa. This places a special responsibility on the Faculty and University to meet the national needs in the provision of veterinarians and veterinary nurses to serve all sectors of veterinary endeavors. South Africa's food security and animal disease control will be severely at risk if there is no sufficient supply of veterinarians and veterinary nurses for state veterinary services or for rural areas and farming communities. The Faculty will admit students to the first year of Veterinary Science (BVSc I) as well as to the second year (BVSc II) according to its selection regulations approved by Senate. For admission to the first year, applicants are evaluated for admission in separate categories as follows: * School leavers * Students with previous university exposure * International students * Specific sector requirements ‚Äì nominated students For admission to the second year, applicants are evaluated for admission in the following categories depending on module combinations: * Students with previous university exposure * International students Admission to DipVetNurs is in the first year only. Categories are as follows: * School leavers * Students with previous university exposure * International students * Specific sector requirements * Repeating students Accommodation The faculty's first residence opened in 1924, the same year as its first year students, all eight of them, graduated. Intake remained small, below the 20 mark, until 1956, with the first batch to exceed 40 qualifying in 1967. Number fluctuated around the 40 mark until 1978 with 69 graduates in 1979. It remained around the 85 students a year mark until 2007. In 2008 a total of 99 students graduated and this grew to 119 in 2009. Onderstepoort new residence The residence at the Faculty is known as House Onderstepoort. House Onderstepoort is unique among all the UP residences in that both undergraduate and postgraduate students are accommodated. The current number of students who can be accommodated at the Onderstepoort campus is 604. In May 2010 a R90m accommodation project was started to increase and improve the accommodation facilities at the campus. The improvements made Onderstepoort the second largest University sustained residence at the University of Pretoria. The new accommodation was made for 144 students, 48 postgraduate students and 24 doing post-doctoral work. The new facilities were officially opened on 22 February. The size of the residence is a major factor in the number of students that the faculty can accept, and being the only veterinary faculty in South Africa, they are trying to provide for the high demand of Veterinarians.

Family Margery was born in about 1478, the daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth and Anne Say, daughter of Sir John Say and Elizabeth Cheney. Margery's first cousins, courtiers Elizabeth and Edmund Howard, were parents to an earlier and later royal wife than her daughter: Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, respectively. Elizabeth Cheney's first husband was Frederick Tilney, father of Elizabeth Tilney, Countess of Surrey. This made Anne Say although not of peerage-level nobility herself, the half-sister of a countess. Wentworth was also a descendant of King Edward III, this remote royal ancestry is partly why Henry VIII found Jane Seymour (her daughter) marriageable. Margery's father, Henry Wentworth, rose to be a critical component of Yorkshire and Suffolk politics: in 1489, during the Yorkshire uprising against Henry VII who had married the female main claimant heir of the former Plantagenet dynasty in order to bolster his own shaky claim to the throne, he left his home and was named the steward of Knaresborough, earning him the privilege to keep the peace in the name of the first Earl of Surrey.

The F marque refers to Flagship, and Fuji Speedway, the chief test site of Lexus performance vehicle development in Oyama, Sunt≈ç District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The first vehicle in the Lexus F marque lineup, the Lexus IS F, was announced in 2006, followed by an F marque coupe concept, the Lexus LF-A, in 2007, and the production LFA sports car in 2009. All Lexus F performance vehicles are denoted by namesake badging on the front fenders. A related performance trim line, Lexus F Sport, was launched for 2007, with an F Sport accessory line and factory models in 2010.

Origins F marque V8 engine. In late 2006, Lexus filed trademark applications for an \\"F\\" emblem, leading to speculation that the luxury marque was about to launch a performance brand. At the time it was suggested that \\"F\\" stood for \\"Fast\\" or \\"Flagship.\\" Later reports surmised that \\"F\\" referred to the Fuji Speedway in Japan, whose first corner, 27R, was said to have inspired the shape of the \\"F\\" emblem. Interviews with company executives in prior years had included mentions of Lexus possibly starting a performance brand to compete with the likes of Mercedes' AMG, Audi's S/RS, Cadillac's V-series, and BMW's M division, among others. An earlier in-house tuning effort, the TRD-based L-Tuned, had offered performance packages on the IS 300 and GS 400 sedans in the early 2000s. Lexus' racing activities and sports model development had been handled by the Lexus Vehicle Performance Development Division, a branch of the Lexus Development Center, located in Aichi, Japan. In September 2001, Lexus announced that the first vehicle in the F marque lineup, the Lexus IS F sedan, previously known in the press as the IS 500, would premiere at the North American International Auto Show in January 2007. The vehicle subsequently premiered at Detroit along with a redesigned version of the concept LF-A sports car. At its press debut, Lexus revealed that a dedicated \\"skunk works\\" team designed the IS F in a manner distinct from typical Lexus engineering efforts. The chief designer of the IS F, Yukihiko Yaguchi, previously worked on the Toyota Supra. Media reports suggested that the IS F sedan would be followed by a GS F sedan and Lexus IS F coupe. However, the GS F was reportedly delayed due to the economic downturn through 2008. Further development of LFA variants were also subject to conflicting reports as to whether the vehicle would be used solely as a racing test platform, discontinue production, or emerge when more favorable economic circumstances arrive. Interviews with company executives indicated that year-end sales of the IS F in 2008 were comparatively strong, and that an LS F model would likely follow if the GS F enters production. Outfitting the Lexus flagship sedan would likely involve the use of the V10 engine developed for the LF-A. In 2009, reports surfaced that the LFA would not be produced in the roadster version, and an IS F convertible, reportedly based on the IS C models first produced in IS 250 C/IS 350 C trim, was also planned. A performance variant of the LS flagship, the LS 460 Sport, was released in 2010,Automobile Magazine review - LS 460 Sport and followed by F Sport versions of the CT 200h, GS 250, GS 350, and RX 350.

It was fought between the army of the Parliamentarians and the combined forces of the Irish Royalists and Confederates during the Irish Confederate Wars.  Background  By late October 1649, the Irish had suffered a number of major defeats at the hands of the army of the English Parliament ‚Äì a defeat at the Battle of Rathmines and the loss of the important towns of Drogheda and Wexford. Ormonde was keen to regain the initiative. In October, he received word from Castlehaven that a column of English soldiers was preparing to march from Dublin to Wexford to reinforce Cromwell's troops in the south. This presented the Irish leadership with a chance to engage the Parliamentarians without risking too many soldiers. The Baron of Inchiquin and Theobald Taaffe (who had fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Knocknanuss only two years before) were given command of a force of 2,500. This operation was of particular importance to the credibility of Inchiquin: he was distrusted by the majority Catholic population of Ireland due to a number of atrocities he had committed in the previous years of fighting, and in the autumn of 1649 many of the Protestant soldiers in Munster formerly loyal to him had mutinied and joined with the forces of Parliament. He now had a chance to regain some standing; it was more or less Inchiquin's last throw of the dice. The English soldiers under Major Nelson left Dublin in the last days of October. As the Parliamentarians proceeded through the Wicklow Mountains they were harassed by tories although these attacks did not substantially hinder the force. In the meantime, Inchiquin prepared an ambush a little to the south of the town of Arklow where the hills come close to the sea. A log barricade was placed across the road to Wexford and infantry men were deployed behind it or otherwise concealed by the roadside. Nelson, however, heard a rumour that an ambush was planned and moved his force using a more roundabout route, hoping to avoid Inchiquin's army. Inchiquin realised what was happening and swiftly moved his cavalry to intercept the Parliamentarians. Most of Nelson's infantry, however, could not keep up and consequently did not take part in the fighting.  The battle  As Inchiquin's mounted force came into view, the English hurriedly deployed on a beach, their backs to the sea. As the Royalist and Irish forces ordered themselves in preparation for an attack, the Parliamentarian horse charged, hoping to catch the enemy by surprise, but were successfully repulsed on two occasions. After the second failed charge, Inchiquin launched a counter-assault with his cavalry on the Parliamentarian horsemen. Demoralised and outnumbered, the Parliamentarian horse fled back towards the infantry, with the Royalists and Irish in pursuit. The disciplined Parliamentarian infantry opened up their ranks to allow their own horse to pass through, after which the gaps in the ranks were closed once more. Inchiquin's charging cavalry now unexpectedly found that the retreating horse had disappeared, to be replaced by a mass of pike-heads and levelled musket barrels. Close range musket fire tore into the Royalist-Irish cavalry, throwing them into disorder and leaving the beach bloodstained. The Parliamentarian cavalry then counter-attacked, forcing the Royalist-Irish forces to retreat. Nelson then resumed his march to Wexford unmolested.  Consequences  The Battle of Arklow was a relatively small battle and the failure of the Irish forces to cripple Nelson's New Model Amry was a demoralising setback but little more. For Inchiquin, however, the consequences were more serious. The battle had presented an opportunity for him to regain the trust of his countrymen, both Catholic and Protestant. His failure to defeat the numerically smaller English force left Inchiquin disgraced. After the battle, Inchiquin returned to Munster, where there were still a number of companies loyal to him. These forces, however, were routed by Broghill in March the next year. Shortly afterwards Inchiquin fled to the continent.

In their roles of emotional support service networks, they have agreed to develop a more effective and robust international interface. VESH represents 1200 member centres in 61 countries. Their goal is to ensure maximum access to effective services for people in distress . They agreed to: *encourage the development of new services in areas of need *promote best practice *increase information sharing between member associations and externally *represent members‚Äô experiences internationally *promote communications skills which contribute to emotional health. Together, the VESH partners have around 1,200 member centres in 61 countries. They have outlined a commitment to information sharing and joint activities. Part of this includes annual meetings and quarterly telephone conferences to plan and implement collaborative projects. At the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) Congress in Ireland in 2007, VESH members #were asked to consider leading the re- establishment of an IASP Task Force on Best Practice in Helplines. #agreed to provide one person to be on the Scientific Committee planning the content of the 2009 IASP International Congress. #agreed to produce two draft booklets along the lines of ‚ÄòSetting up a New Emotional Support Service‚Äô, and ‚ÄòBest Practice Guidelines‚Äô (following a request from WHO) History In 2002 IFOTES, LifeLine International and Befrienders International (and later adopted by Befrienders Worldwide) signed a Memorandum of Understanding - with a view to maximising joint impact in terms of emotional support services. Since then a number of joint initiatives have been undertaken including joint platforms at international conferences of the International Association for Suicide Prevention and joint involvement in planning for the suicide themed World Mental Health Day 2006, a European Single Number project (116 123) and European Green Paper on Mental Health.

This would be something along the lines of an ‚ÄòInternational Network of Emotional Support Services‚Äô. This would be to both provide a common platform, as well as an information exchange hub taking advantage of the enormous diversity of the combined members experiences - both geographically and in terms of innovative responses in providing emotional support. They believe that a combined network can build on and take advantage of member diversity, whilst also ensuring members feel connected to each other and feel an identity with such a network. =Taking collaboration to a new level= Each VESH member already values their activities, and the role they've played in influencing best practice and raising the profile of the combined networks. They want to take this collaboration to a new level, to enable them to respond effectively to new opportunities and responsibilities. Members have limited resources, and to have most influence and impact at a national, regional and international level want to improve links between all members, at all these levels. This could, for instance, include joint regional workshops and other activities; or to better take advantage of the materials available in various languages. #members work in an increasingly mobile and global society, with rapidly developing technologies. They want to improve their capacity to respond to these trends, and ensure effective cross-border activities. #members want to engage with such international bodies as the World Health Organization, the International Association for Suicide Prevention and the World Federation for Mental Health.

It was created by a royal decree of 14 July 1819 to manufacture swords, then (after 1850) firearms and cannons. Antoine Treuille de Beaulieu in 1840 began to develop the concept of rifled artillery at Ch√¢tellerault for the French Army. The Lebel Model 1886 rifle, the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition and the primary French infantry weapon during World War I, was developed and produced here. History Following the French tradition of state arsenals competing with each other and with private industry, MAC designed and manufactured several well-known French small arms, including the FM 24/29 light machine gun and its derivatives the MAC mle 1931 and MAC 1934 machine guns, as well as the MAC 1950 (later MAS 1950) semi-automatic pistol. Some features of prototypes developed by MAC, including the MAC-48 submachine gun, MAC 1950 machine carbine and MAC 1955 automatic rifle, were retained in the production of other designers' weapons which were adopted by the French Army. The facility closed as a weapons manufacturing facility in 1968 and was transformed into the central repository of all French military archives related to armament matters (Centre des Archives de l'Armement et du Personnel).

A ghoonghat (ghunghat, ghunghta, ghumta, orhni, laaj, chunari, jhund) is a headcovering or headscarf, worn in the Indian subcontinent, by some married Hindu, Jain, Muslim and Sikh women to cover their heads, and often their faces. Generally aanchal or pallu, the loose end of a sari is pulled over the head and face to act as a ghunghat. A dupatta (long scarf) is also commonly used as a ghungat. Today, facial veiling by Hindu women as part of everyday attire is now mostly limited to the Hindi Belt region of India,Raj Mohini Sethi (2011) \\"Socio-economic Profile of Rural India (series II).\\", p.111IHDS 2004‚Äì5 data \\"Gender and Family Dynamics.\\", p.153 particularly Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.It is very common in Northern parts of India and is also an important part of Northern Indian weddings where brides cover their head and their faces using this veil and take off this veil from their head while the groom garlands the bride. Facial veiling is not sanctioned in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism but some sections of the society from the 1st century B.C. advocated the use of the veil for married women, which came to be known as ghoonghat.Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.174 It has been both romanticized and criticized in religious and folk literature.Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.171 Etymology The word ghoongat, ghunghat or ghunghta is derived from Avagunthana (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§µ‡§ó‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§†‡§®) meaning veil, hiding and cloak and Oguntheti (Pali: ‡§ì‡§ó‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§•‡•á‡§§‡§ø) to cover, veil over and hide.http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=avaguNThana&script;=&direction;=SE&link;=yesAmbala·πÖgo·∏ça Polvattƒì Buddhadatta, A.

This hair-net of various colors was called as jƒÅlaka and it was used to keep the hair from being ruffled by breezes. However, this female hair-dress was not used by women every day and at every time. It was worn on special occasions like marriage or at the time of going out. ≈ö≈´draka notes that a married woman was expected to put on a veil while moving in the public. This may indicate that it was not necessary for unmarried females to put on a veil.Sulochana Ayyar (1987) \\"Costumes and Ornaments as Depicted in the Sculptures of Gwalior Museum.\\", p.152 In M·πõcchakatika, courtesan Vasantasena's mother, having received ornaments for her daughter from a wealthy suitor to keep her as his mistress, she sends Vasantasena with her maid, asks her to go in the carriage bedecked with ornaments and to put on her avagunthana veil. This instruction is taken to signify that a courtesan who has accepted a suitor, had to use a veil in public similar to married women.Govind Sadashiv Ghurye (1951) \\"Indian Costume.\\", p.236 At the end of the play when Vasanthasena is legally wedded, she receives the title \\"Vadh≈´≈õabda\\" meaning \\"title of a bride\\" simultaneously with the veil \\"vasantasenƒÅm avagunthya\\" meaning \\"a token of honorable marriage\\".Laurie Patton (1961) \\"Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.\\", p.81 In the same literature, courtesans' maid servant Madanika marries her lover Sarvilaka, a thief who changes his ways.

In Buddhist Mahayana literature, Lalitavistara S≈´tra written in the 3rd century CE, young bride YasodharƒÅ objected to observe veiling (oguntheti/ogu·πáthikƒÅ) in front of respected elders. This was taken to be a sign of immodesty and willfulness, as people criticized her and gossiped.Betty Kelen 1967 \\"Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend\\" chapter 1, pp. 7 and 8 When she became aware of this, YasodharƒÅ came before the assembled court and defended herself in a long statement: \\"Those whose thoughts have no cover, no shame or decorum or any virtue, those who gossip, may cover themselves with a thousand garments, yet they walk the earth naked. But those who veil their minds, control their senses, and have no thought for any other except their husband, why should they veil their faces?\\" YasodharƒÅ's parents-in-law were delighted with their daughter-in-law's proud statement and gave her two white garments covered with jewels.Betty Kelen 1967 \\"Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend\\" chapter 1, pp. 7 and 8 The Lalitavistara S≈´tra reflects changing times around the 3rd century CE and Buddhists' attempt to counter this growing practice, as there is no mention of this entire incident in early Buddhist Theravada literature.Betty Kelen 1967 \\"Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend\\" chapter 1, pp. 7 and 8Rohini Chowdhury 2011 \\"Gautama Buddha: The Lord of Wisdom\\" chapter 1, page 9. However, the mention of face veil in any literature was mostly restricted to the royal and noble ladies. In Valmiki's Ramayana dated between the 5th century BCE to the first century BCE, Prince Rama asks his wife Sita to unveil herself so that the gathered citizens of Ayodhya can take a look at them before they go in exile to the forest; there is no mention of Sita veiling herself again after this incident.Anjani Kant (1951) \\"Women and the Law.\\", p.43 At the end of the epic, hearing the news of Ravana's death, his queens giving up to lamentations rush outside without their Avagunthana, in which chief queen Mandodari surrounding his corpse says \\"Why do you not get angry, beholding me, having put off my veil, walk out on foot by the city gate? Do you behold your wives who have thrown off their veils. Why are you not angry seeing them all come out of the city?\\" Valmiki Ramanaya, chapter 111 - stanza 6-111-63 and 6-111-64 Thus, it is notable that royal women avoided public gaze and veiling was expected to be worn only by married women.Anjani Kant (1951) \\"Women and the Law.\\", p.43 In Abhij√±ƒÅna≈õƒÅkuntalam by KƒÅlidƒÅsa, written between the 3rd and 4th century CE, when the heroine arrives at King Duhsanta's palace, seeking to take up her wifely status, the king first remarks \\"KƒÅ svid avagunthanavati\\" meaning \\"who is this veiled one?\\" and immediately forbears to look at her, with the words \\"Anirvarnaniyam parakalatram\\" meaning \\"The wife of another is not to be inspected.\\"Laurie Patton (1961) \\"Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.\\", p.81 This largely indicates that Avagunthana was a sign of a respectable married woman, and was a married woman's raiment.Laurie Patton (1961) \\"Jewels of Authority: Women and Textual Tradition in Hindu India.\\", p.81 =Medieval period= In KathƒÅsaritsƒÅgara written in the 11th century AD, heroine in the story RatnaprabhƒÅ protesting: \\"I consider that the strict seclusion of women is a folly produced by jealousy. It is of no use whatsoever. Women of good character are guarded only by their own virtue and nothing else.\\"Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.173 Rational opposition against veiling and seclusion from spirited ladies resulted in the system not becoming popular for several centuries.Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.171 However, it is notable that some section of society from the 1st century B.C. advocated the use of the veil for married women. There is no proof that a large section of society observed strict veiling until the medieval period.Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.174 Under the Islamic Mughal Empire, various aspects of veiling and seclusion of women was adopted, such as the concept of Purdah and Zenana, partly as an additional protection for women, they were abducted so to prevent the consequences veil became necessary.Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.175 Purdah became common in the 15th and 16th century, as both VidyƒÅpati and Chaitanya mention it.Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) \\"The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.\\", p.175 Sikhism was highly critical of purdah; Guru Amar Das condemned it and rejected seclusion and veiling of women, which saw decline of purdah among most classes during this period. A Hindu bride with full veiling during Hindu wedding ceremony in Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. =Significance= In ghoonghat practice, facial veiling observed by married women is known as Laaj (Sanskrit: ‡§≤‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§æ, Lajja - modesty, honor, shame). In veiling practice, it literally means \\"To keep (one's) modesty, shame and honor\\". Earliest attested word Laaj in context of veiling is found in Valmiki's Ramayana as lajjaavaguNThanaan describing Mandodari. Valmiki Ramanaya, chapter 111 - stanza 6-111-63 and 6-111-64 However, it is unclear whether it refers to facial veiling.Anjani Kant (1951) \\"Women and the Law.\\", p.43 During a marriage ceremony, the bride wears a veil given by her parents. Later, during the ceremony the bride's mother-in-law covers her face with ghoonghat; she therefore simultaneously wears the veil given by her parents and that from her in-laws, symbolizing her passing from the protection of one's household to another.Emma Tarlo 1996 \\"Clothing Matters: Dress and Identity in India\\", p.177 Muh Dikhai (Devanagari: ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§π ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§à, first gaze) is a post-wedding ceremony, where the bride is formally introduced to the groom's relatives and extended family. The ceremony takes place once the bride arrives in her new home; each family member lifts her veil, looks at the bride and gives her a welcoming gift. She receives Shagun from her mother-in-law, which is typically jewelry, clothing and silverware. After this ceremony the bride observes full veiling for the next few months or until her parents-in-law advise her to unveil.Doranne Jacobson, Susan Snow Wadley 1999 \\"Women in India: two perspectives\\", p.195 =Post-1900s= During the early 1900s, women of royal and aristocratic class were first to abandon strict veiling in public. However, the head was loosely veiled due to sensitivity towards the custom during changing times.Laurie Patton (2004) \\"Maharanis: The Lives and Times of Three Generations of Indian Princesses.\\", p.81 The other classes soon followed; it lingered on in some parts of India until well after the 1940s. Facial veiling has gradually declined, and is mostly limited to parts of Hindi-speaking areas today.Raj Mohini Sethi (2011) \\"Socio-economic Profile of Rural India (series II).\\", p.111 In ghungat, a woman will veil her face from all men to whom she's related by marriage and who are senior to her husband. This would include, for example, her husband's father, elder brother and uncles. The effect of ghungat is to limit a young woman's interaction with older men. In 2004, the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) found that 55% of women in India practice some form of ghoonghat, majority of them in Hindi-speaking states.IHDS 2004‚Äì5 data \\"Gender and Family Dynamics.\\", p.153 The survey found that some women may cover their face fully but for others, partial covering of the face is more a nod to propriety than a large impediment.IHDS 2004‚Äì5 data \\"Gender and Family Dynamics.\\", p.153 =Gallery= File:‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§π ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ø 4 - ‡§ú‡§Ø‡§™‡•Å‡§∞, ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§.JPGBride in veiling during Muh Dikhai ceremony.

Old Irish bal, bail place, situation, condition, (good) luck) was a Roman fort at the modern-day hamlet of Rudchester, Northumberland. It was the fourth fort on Hadrian's Wall, after Segedunum (Wallsend), Pons Aelius (Newcastle) and Condercum (Benwell). It was situated about to the west of Condercum. The name Vindobala means ‚ÄúWhite Strength‚Äù. The site of the fort is bisected by the B6318 Military Road, which runs along the route of the wall at that point. Description The fort guards the valley of the March Burn to the west, an ancient route leading to the south towards the Tyne ford at Newburn. To the east the ground drops away to the Rudchester Burn. The fort is oblong, measuring north to south by east to west, and covers about . There were four main gates with double portals and two smaller, single-portal gates. There was one main gate on the north wall of the fort, and the east and west main gates opened on the north side of the Roman Wall. This left a single main gate on the south wall of the fort, and two smaller gates which probably gave access to a military way running along the south side of the Wall. There were towers at each corner of the fort, and also on either side of the main gates. The Vallum passed about south of the fort, and there was a vicus south and south west of the fort. South of the fort, on the brow of a hill, is a cistern, twelve feet long, four and a half feet broad and two feet deep. It was popularly known as the ‚ÄúGiant‚Äôs Grave‚Äù. Now there is little to be seen on the surface, apart from mounds to the south of the Military Road marking the west and south ramparts. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries stones were systematically removed from the site for local agricultural buildings, and also for the building of the Military Road. Garrison The fort was garrisoned in the fourth century by the First Cohort of Frisiavones. These were troops recruited from a coastal tribe of Lower Germany. It is thought that the fort was built for a cohort, 500 strong and part-mounted. Excavations In 1760 a life-size statue of Hercules was found at the site. Excavations of the site were carried out in 1924 and 1962. Two of the main gateways were excavated, as well as a large granary and part of the headquarters. In addition, a hypocaust belonging to the commandant's house was discovered. Mithraeum In 1844, five altars, dedicated to Mithras, were discovered near the site, now known as the Rudchester Mithraeum. It is believed that these come from a temple to Mithras, situated to the south east of the fort. It appears that this was built in the third century and was deliberately destroyed in the fourth century. The building was long and wide with a narthex, or vestibule, attached to the front. Curtain Wall In 1924, an excavation took place on the wall line 1924 at a point west of the fort. The north face was erected on a foundation course of coarse white stones. The first course was topped by an elaborately moulded plinth (unknown elsewhere). It has been speculated that this was the location of a special inscription stone marking work on the wall.

Initially a Bourbon soldier, later he fought in the service of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Soon after the Italian unification he formed an army of two thousand men, leading the most cohesive and feared band in southern Italy and becoming the most formidable leader on the Bourbon side.Eric J. Hobsbawm, Bandits, p.25 He was renowned for his guerrilla tactics, such as cutting water supplies, destroying flour-mills, cutting telegraph wires and ambushing stragglers.John Ellis, A short history of guerrilla warfare, p.83 Although some authors of the 19th and the early 20th century regarded him as a \\"wicked thief and assassin\\"Vittorio Bersezio, Il regno di Vittorio Emanuele II, Roux e Favale, 1895, p. 25 or a \\"fierce thief, vulgar murderer\\",Basilide Del Zio, Il brigante Crocco e la sua autobiografia Tipografia G. Grieco, 1903, p.116 since the second half of the 20th century writers (especially supporters of the Revisionism of Risorgimento) began to see him in a new light, as an \\"engine of the peasant revolution\\"Carlo Alianello, L'eredit√† della priora, Feltrinelli, 1963, p. 568 and a \\"resistant ante litteram, one of the most brilliant military geniuses that Italy had\\". Today, many people of southern Italy and in particular of his native region Basilicata, consider him a folk hero.Mario Monti, I briganti italiani, vol.2, p.17 LifeYouth= Crocco was born into a family of five children in Rionero in Vulture, which was at the time part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His father, Francesco Crocco, was a servant of the noble Santangelo family from Venosa and his mother, Maria Gerarda Santomauro, was a housewife. His uncle Martino was a veteran of the Napoleonic army who fought in Spain during the Peninsular War, losing a leg, probably in the siege of Saragossa. Crocco grew up with the tales of his uncle, from whom he learned to read and write. While a child, Crocco began to develop an aversion towards the upper class, after his brother was beaten by Don Vincenzo, a young lord, for killing a dog who had attacked a Crocco family chicken. His mother, pregnant at that time, tried to defend her son but the lord kicked her in the belly, forcing her to abort.Indro Montanelli, L'Italia dei notabili. (1861-1900), p.85 His father was later accused of the attempted murder of Don Vincenzo and was imprisoned without sufficient proof.Tommaso Pedio, Storia della Basilicata raccontata ai ragazzi, p.264 During his adolescence, Crocco moved to Apulia, to work as a shepherd, along with his brother, Donato. In 1845, Crocco saved the life of don Giovanni Aquilecchia, a nobleman of Atella, who had tried to cross the raging waters of the Ofanto River. Aquilecchia rewarded him with 50 ducats, permitting Crocco to eventually return to his home town from Apulia and find a new job. Crocco had the opportunity to meet Don Pietro Ginistrelli, Aquilecchia's brother-in-law, who was able to secure the release of his father from prison.Tommaso Pedio, Storia della Basilicata raccontata ai ragazzi, p.265 However, by the time he was released Francesco Crocco was old and sick and this left Crocco to act as head of his family, working as a farmer in Rionero. Here he met don Ferdinando, don Vincenzo's son, who felt regret for his father's behavior against the family. Don Ferdinando offered him a job as a farmer on his property, but Crocco preferred to take money instead, which he used to avoid the military service, as during the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, service was avoidable upon payment. The nobleman accepted but was killed on 15 May 1848 in Naples by some Swiss troops. Thus Crocco had to join Ferdinand II's army, but he deserted as a result of killing a comrade in a brawl. In his absence, his sister Rosina had to take care of the family. =Becoming an outlaw= Crocco killing Don Peppino who insulted his sister During Crocco's absence. his sister, Rosina, then not yet eighteen years old, was courted by a nobleman, Don Peppino. Rosina was not interested in him and rejected him. Annoyed by his refusal, Peppino proceeded to defame her. When Crocco heard about these events he was angry and decided to avenge his sister. Knowing the habits of Peppino, who generally attended a particular club to gamble in the evening hours, Crocco awaited his return at Peppino's home. When Don Peppino arrived, Crocco questioned him but the discussion ended in a fight, after Peppino hit Crocco with a whip. Blinded by rage, Crocco pulled out a knife, killed Peppino and then fled to the Forenza woods. However this account is controversial because Captain Eugenio Massa, who collaborated on the Crocco's autobiography, conducted a detailed investigation on the spot and could not confirm that a murder had taken place in the circumstances described by Crocco.Basilide Del Zio, Il brigante Crocco e la sua autobiografia, p.120 While in hiding, Crocco met other outlaws and together they formed a band that lived on the proceeds of blackmail and robbery. Crocco returned to Rionero but was arrested on 13 October 1855. He escaped during the night of 13‚Äì14 December 1859, hiding in the woods between Monticchio and Lagopesole.Antonio De Leo, Carmine Cr√≤cco Donatelli: un brigante guerrigliero, p.36 =Expedition of the Thousand= The Battle of Volturnus At the same time Giuseppe Garibaldi was launching his Expedition of the Thousand, and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was soon on the verge of collapse, requiring all forces remaining at its command to confront Garibaldi. Garibaldi managed to defeat them, gain control of Sicily and then cross to the mainland, where he moved swiftly north towards Naples.Tommaso Pedio, Storia della Basilicata raccontata ai ragazzi, p.266 Garibaldi promised to forgive the deserters in exchange for military service and Crocco joined Garibaldi's army hoping for a pardon as well as other rewards.Denis Mack Smith, Italy:a modern history, p.72 Crocco accompanied Garibaldi north to Naples and took part in the famous Battle of Volturnus. Although he displayed courage in battle, Crocco did not receive any medals or other honors and was also arrested.Indro Montanelli, L'Italia dei notabili. (1861-1900), p.86 He was taken to the prison in Cerignola but, with the help of the noble Fortunato family (relatives of the politician Giustino), he was able to get away. Disappointed by the new Italian government's lies, Crocco was persuaded by noblemen linked to Bourbons and the local clergy to join the legitimist cause. Meanwhile, Basilicata's population began to rise against the new government, because it did not get any benefit with the political change and became even poorer than before, while the bourgeois class (faithful to the Bourbons in the past) maintained its privileges, after having supported the cause of the Italian unification opportunistically.Tommaso Pedio, La Basilicata Borbonica, Lavello, 1986, p. 7 With the war and pecuniary support of the legitimists, he recruited an army of 2000 men,Sergio Romano, Storia d'Italia dal Risorgimento ai nostri giorni, p.49 beginning the resistance under the flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. =In the service of Francis II = Jos√© Borjes In 10 days, Crocco and his army occupied the entire Vulture area. In the conquered territory he ordered the badges and ornaments of the king Francis II to be once again displayed. The raids were bloody, ruthless and many people (especially liberal politicians and wealthy landowners) were kidnapped, blackmailed or brutally killed by Crocco himself or his members but, in most cases, people of lower classes regarded him as a \\"liberator\\" and supported his bands.Indro Montanelli, L'Italia dei notabili. (1861-1900), p.88 On 7 April 1861 Crocco occupied Lagopesole and, the day after, Ripacandida, where he defeated the local garrison of the \\"Italian National Guard\\". On 10 April 1861, his army entered Venosa and sacked it. During the siege of Venosa, Crocco's men killed Francesco Nitti, a physician and an ex-member of the Carbonari, as well as grandfather of the politician Francesco Saverio Nitti.Francesco Barbagallo, Francesco Saverio Nitti, p. 5 Subsequently Lavello was invaded, where he set up a court which judged 27 liberals and the municipal coffers were emptied of 7,000 ducats, 6,500 of which were distributed to the peopleRenzo Del Carria, Proletari senza rivoluzione, p.87 and then Melfi. Crocco's army also conquered parts of Campania (Sant'Angelo dei Lombardi, Monteverde, Conza, Teora),A. Maffei count, Marc Monnier, Brigand life in Italy: a history of Bourbonist reaction, Volume 2, p.39 Apulia (Bovino and Terra di Bari).Aldo De Jaco, Il brigantaggio meridionale, p.218 Augustin De Langlais Impressed by his victories, the Bourbon government in exile sent the Spanish General Jos√© Borjes to Basilicata, to reinforce and discipline the bands and warning the band chief about an imminent reinforcement of soldiers. The goal of Borjes was the capitulation of Potenza, the most well-defended stronghold of the Italian army in Basilicata. Crocco did not trust Borjes from the start and worried about losing his leadership, but he accepted the alliance. Meanwhile, another legitimist agent arrived: Augustin De Langlais from France, an ambiguous person about which little is known of his life, including the reason for his presence among the brigands.Benedetto Croce, Uomini e cose della vecchia Italia, p.324 Crocco, with the support of Borjes and De Langlais, conquered other towns searching for new recruits, including Trivigno, Calciano, Garaguso, Craco and Aliano. Crocco's army made its way to Potenza, occupying neighboring cities such as Guardia Perticara, San Chirico Raparo and Vaglio, but the expedition to the main city failed because of a clash between Crocco and Borjes on the military campaign. After other battles and retreating to Monticchio, one of his headquarters, Crocco broke the alliance with Borjes because he did not want to serve under a foreigner and did not believe the promise of the Bourbon government about the provision of reinforcements. Disappointed, Borjes planned to go to Rome, to inform King Francis II but, during the journey, he was captured in Tagliacozzo and shot by Piedmontese soldiers headed by Major Enrico Franchini. =Last days= Portrait of Crocco (first on the right) during his imprisonment in Portoferraio Without external support, Crocco turned to plundering and extortion to raise funds, cooperating with like-minded confederates and making raids from Molise to Apulia. Vespasiano De Luca, director of Public Safety in Rionero, invited him to sign a treaty of surrender but Crocco declined. Even without the help of the Bourbons, Crocco, skilled in guerrilla warfare, was able to harass the Piedmontese soldiers. Faced with the apparent invincibility of Crocco's army, the Hungarian Legion (who helped Garibaldi during the expedition of the thousand) intervened in support of the royal coalition.Basilide Del Zio, Il brigante Crocco e la sua autobiografia, p. 159-160 Suddenly, Crocco was betrayed by Giuseppe Caruso, one of his lieutenants. Caruso went to the Piedmontese authorities and revealed Crocco's location and hideouts. Under the command of General Emilio Pallavicini (known to have stopped Garibaldi's expedition against Rome in the calabrian mountains), the royal army engaged and defeated Crocco. His band suffered many casualties, and some of his lieutenants, such as Ninco Nanco and Giuseppe \\"Sparviero\\" Schiavone, were captured and executed by firing squad, leaving Crocco to retire toward the Ofanto zone. After losing the last battle, he was forced to flee to the Papal States, hoping for help from Pius IX, whom he knew had previously supported the southern opposition.Nicholas Atkin, Frank Tallet, Priests, prelates and people: a history of European Catholicism since 1750, p.134 Upon arrival Crocco was captured by papal troops in Veroli and imprisoned in Rome. He was then turned over to the Italian authorities and sentenced to death on 11 September 1872 in Potenza, but the sentence was commuted to hard labour for life. He was imprisoned on Santo Stefano Island, where he began writing his memoirs, with the help of Eugenio Massa, captain of the royal army, which published them in 1903, under the name Gli ultimi briganti della Basilicata (The last brigands of Basilicata). The manuscript was republished in the post- World War II era by other authors like Tommaso Pedio (1963), Mario Proto (1994) and Valentino Romano (1997). Crocco was later transferred to the prison at Portoferraio, where he died on 18 June 1905. Legacy Crocco is the main character of the production La Storia Bandita (The Bandit's Story) that is held every year in Brindisi Montagna. Artists such as Michele Placido, Antonello Venditti and Lucio Dalla have participated in the production. The movie Il Brigante di Tacca del Lupo (1952), directed by Pietro Germi, is vaguely based on the Crocco's story. He appears in the second episode of the Italian TV drama L'eredit√† della priora (1980) by Anton Giulio Majano. He made a cameo appearance in the film 'o Re (1989) directed by Luigi Magni. He is the main protagonist of the 1999 movie Li chiamarono... briganti! (They called them... brigands!) directed by Pasquale Squitieri, starring Enrico Lo Verso (in the role of Crocco), Claudia Cardinale, Remo Girone, Franco Nero among the others. The movie was unsuccessful and was quickly suspended from its run in cinemas, although reviewers claimed that the truth was uncomfortable to some viewers.Lorenzo Del Boca, Indietro Savoia!, p. 231. He is the main protagonist of the TV film Il generale dei briganti (2012) by Paolo Poeti; Crocco is played by Daniele Liotti. The Italian actor Michele Placido, born and raised in Apulia to a Lucanian father from Rionero in Vulture and an Apulian mother, claims to be a descendant of Crocco. The Italian musician Eugenio Bennato dedicated the song Il Brigante Carmine Crocco, from the 1980 album Brigante se more to him. In November 2008, a museum dedicated to Crocco, named La Tavern r Crocc (English: The Tavern of Crocco) was opened in his home town.

It is based at Bovington in Dorset. The original RMASG was formed in the Second World War to give British and Commonwealth forces heavy fire support in the opening attacks of the Normandy Landings.  History  Centaur IV of RMASG near Tilly-sur-Seulles, 13 June 1944 The original Royal Marines Armoured Support Group was formed during the Second World War and took part in the Invasion of Normandy, where it provided fire support. It was primarily equipped with Centaur IV tanks fitted with a 95 mm howitzer; there were also a smaller number of Sherman tanks, which were used as artillery observation posts or command vehicles. The Group consisted of two Armoured Support Regiments, each of two Armoured Support Batteries, plus an independent Armoured Support Battery. Each Battery consisted of four troops, with each troop equipped with four Centaur IV and one Sherman tank, giving a total of 80 Centaur and 20 Sherman tanks in the group, which fought on the British and Canadian D-Day beaches. * 1st Royal Marine Armoured Support Regiment at Gold Beach comprising the 1st Battery (A, B, C and D Troops) and the 2nd Battery (E, F, G and H Troops). * 2nd Royal Marine Armoured Support Regiment at Juno Beach comprising the 3rd Battery (J, K, L and M Troops) and the 4th Battery (N, O, P and Q Troops). * 5th Royal Marine Independent Armoured Support Battery at Sword Beach comprising R, S, T and V Troops. The wartime RMASG was disbanded two weeks after D-Day (D+14). Part of the Armoured Support Group, which had been reformed as the 29th Infantry Battalion, Royal Marines, was moved to Aldershot to become the 34th Amphibian Support Regiment, Royal Marines. The Regiment moved to India in 1945, collected equipment and trained for operations that were planned to take place in Malaya in September. The unit was organized into a headquarters, two support batteries each of three troops armed with four LVT (A-4), one rocket battery of three troops of four LVT (R) and one flank battery of two troops of five LVT (F). This regiment was disbanded in 1948. The modern Royal Marines Armoured Support Group was formed from the Royal Marines Armoured Support Company (Afghanistan) and the Royal Marines Viking Training Squadron, a subunit of the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines based at the Armour Centre in Bovington, Dorset. The Royal Marines Armoured Support specialisation was established in 2005 in recognition of the fact that the then relatively new BvS10 Viking armoured vehicle demanded a high degree of professional and specialist crew training and a professional career progression for Royal Marines within the Armoured Support 'branch'. A proposal to form a new specialisation and indeed to call it the 'Armoured Support' specialisation (in recognition of the Royal Marines' armoured units of WW2) was put forward and argued by then OC Viking Training Sqn - Major Jez Hermer MBE RM, the officer who had taken BvS10 on operations for the first time in Afghanistan in September 2006, prior to the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group being formed in December 2007.  Role and equipment  Viking Armoured Vehicle of the Royal Marines during a demonstration at the Portsmouth International Festival in 2005. RMASG is under the overall control of 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines and is the armoured element of 3 Commando Brigade, equipped with the Viking armoured vehicle. The Viking BvS10 All Terrain Vehicle, is a protected tracked vehicle, which can be configured for troop transport, command and control and other tasks. Viking is equipped with the 7.62mm General Purpose Machine Gun and some crewmen are armed with the L22 carbine version of the British SA80 family. Viking has been deployed operationally with British Forces in southern Afghanistan, supporting both 3 Cdo Bde and other roulements. The need for the RMASG came about because the Viking was so successful with 3 Cdo Bde on Op Herrick 5 that the incoming forces on Op Herrick 6 requested that the Vikings stay on creating a problem as the Army has no Viking trained drivers. The solution was the RMASG, an expanded unit that could continue to operate the Viking for future roulements, this led to the drivers of the RMASG having one of the highest operational tempos in the forces. Future requirements On 12 June 2008, the British Ministry of Defence publicly issued a notice stating that \\"There is a requirement under consideration for an All Terrain Military vehicle that is armoured, amphibious and fitted with (or fitted for but not with) weapon systems, in a supporting role to VIKING, to replace the existing BV206\\". The new system would be known as the All Terrain Vehicle Support (ATV(S)) and be capable of high mobility operation in a variety of terrains and threat environments as well as being amphibious. A need for between 47 and 212 ATV(S) was foreseen at an estimated cost of between ¬£100 million to ¬£250 million. However, just over a month later, on 17 July 2008, the contract notice setting out the requirement for ATV(S) was cancelled. The Ministry of Defence gave the following reason: > The requirement for an All Terrain Military Vehicle (ATV (S)) under > LASS1A/0340 has been delayed due to internal reviews. It is anticipated that > a revised announcement will be advertised in the UK MoD Defence Contracts > Bulletin in mid 2009 and the revised announcement will also be sent to the > EDA for inclusion in the Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) at that time. On 19 December 2008, the Ministry of Defence announced that 100 Singapore Technologies Kinetics Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier vehicles would be purchased as an Urgent Operational Requirement to replace the Viking vehicles in use in Afghanistan. The new vehicle would be known in British service as the Warthog and enter service in 2009. The press release further stated that \\"When the Vikings are brought back from Afghanistan they will be used by the Royal Marines on training exercises\\". Nevertheless, Viking appears to be the core armoured vehicle for the Royal Marines in the future. 99 Vikings are being upgraded with new mine blast protection bodywork and brought back to their original amphibious standard, having been adapted for the rigours of land operations. In April 2016, a Jane's report stated that the Royal Marines are looking for a replacement for the older Bv 206D vehicles, which will be out of service by 2021.  Awards  The Royal Marines Armoured Support Group was awarded the 'True Grit: Group' award during the 2008 Sun Military Awards, \\"For a small unit or group of men or women from any service who have together performed a single act of true grit - through courage, determination or self- sacrifice ‚Äì be it on or off duty\\".

Death of Lucius III and the election of Pope Urban III Pope Lucius III died at Verona on November 25, 1185 at very advanced age. On that same day, eighteen cardinals present on his deathbed started proceedings to elect his successor. Majority of them came from Northern Italy and formed a radically anti-imperial faction, while more moderate cardinals (mostly Romans) were absent.I.S.Robinson, p. 86 In such circumstances, Northern Italian cardinals quickly secured the election of their candidate Uberto Crivelli of Milan. He was unanimously elected within a few hours after the death of Lucius III, and took the name of Urban III. He was crowned at Verona on December 1, 1185. After his election to the papacy, he retained the administration of the metropolitan see of Milan.The Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Urban III NotesSources  1185 Category:1185 in Europe Category:12th-century elections Category:1185 Category:12th-century Catholicism ","title":"1185 papal election"},{"id":"18073683","text":"Mia Clarke (born 20 March 1983) is a British guitarist from the alternative rock band Electrelane and an entrepreneur.

Its object is the devout remembrance and honour of Christ's sufferings for the redemption of mankind. History Whilst the feast in honour of the instruments of Christ's Passion‚Äîthe Holy Cross, Lance, Nails, and Crown of Thorns‚Äîcalled \\"Arma Christi\\", originated during the Middle Ages, this commemoration is of more recent origin. It appears for the first time in the Breviary of Meissen (1517) as a festum simplex for 15 November. The same Breviary has a feast of the Holy Face for 15 January and of the Holy Name for 15 March.Grotefend, \\"(Zeitrechnung\\" (Hanover, 1892), II, 118 sqq. These feasts disappeared with the introduction of Lutheranism. As found in the appendix of the Roman Breviary, it was initiated by St. Paul of the Cross (d. 1775). The Office was composed by Thomas Struzzieri, Bishop of Todi, the associate of St. Paul. This Office and the corresponding feast were approved by Pope Pius VI (1775‚Äì99) for the Discalced Clerics of the Holy Cross and the Passion of Christ (commonly called Passionists), founded by St. Paul of the Cross. The feast is celebrated by them as a double of the first class with an octave.Nilles, \\"Kal. man.\\", II, 69. At the same time Pius VI approved the other Offices and feasts of the Mysteries of Christ's Passion: the Feast of the Prayer of Our Lord in the Garden (Tuesday after Septuagesima); the Feast of the Crown of Thorns (Friday after Ash-Wednesday); the Holy Lance and Nails (Friday after the first Sunday in Lent); and for the following Fridays: the feasts of the Holy Winding Sheet, the Five Wounds, and the Precious Blood of Christ (cf. appendix to the Roman Breviary). These feasts were, at least in part, adopted by many dioceses and religious orders. Most of them are found in the proprium of Salerno (a. 1798), as also is the feast of the Passion (a double of the first class with an octave). This latter feast was celebrated with an octave in all the dioceses of the former Kingdom of Naples. On 30 August 1809, the privilege of the feast (double major) was granted to the Diocese of Leghorn for the Friday before Passion Sunday. In the old St. Louis Ordo (1824) it was assigned to Friday after Ash-Wednesday, which day it still retains in the Baltimore Ordo. The seven Offices of the Mysteries of the Passion of Christ were adopted by the City of Rome in 1831Corresp. de Rome, 1848, p. 30. and since then all the dioceses that have the feast of the Passion of Christ in their calendar keep it on the Tuesday after Sexagesima. By permission of Pope Leo XIII (8 May 1884) the octave in the calendar of the Passionists is privileged and admits only feasts of the first and second class. By a decree of 5 July 1883, the votive Office of the Passion of Christ may be said every Friday which is not taken up by a semi-double or a double Office, except during the period from Passion Sunday to Low Sunday and from 18 December to 13 January. The Office composed by Struzzieri is rich and full of pious sentiment; the hymns, however, are rather modern. NotesReferences ;Attribution * The entry cites: **Nilles, Kal. man.

Founded in 1764, it was merged into the French state-owned defense conglomerate GIAT Industries in 2001. Saint √âtienne-La Manufacture d'Armes-20110111  History  Saint- √âtienne was well-known as a center of sword and knife manufacturing beginning in the Middle Ages. In 1665, a Royal Arms Depot was created in Paris to store military weapons made in Saint-√âtienne. The Manufacture d'Armes de Saint- √âtienne was created by royal decree in 1764 under the supervision of the General Inspector of the Royal Arms Manufacture of Charleville. 12,000 weapons were being produced each year when the French Revolution began in 1789. The city was renamed Armsville during the Revolutionary period and production increased to arm the French Revolutionary Army. Subsequently, the French Empire required a threefold increase in production to meet the needs of the Grande Arm√©e in its conquest of Europe. By 1838, during the July Monarchy, annual production was well over 30,000 firearms. In 1864, the modern factory was built, new steam-powered machines were installed and the first military standardized bolt-action rifle, the Chassepot, was produced from 1866 on, then the Gras rifle after 1874. The MAC-designed Lebel rifle entered production in 1886. MAS later designed and manufactured the family of rifles chambered in 7.5√ó54mm French, from the MAS-36 through the MAS-49/56, then later the FAMAS bullpup assault rifle, which uses the 5.56√ó45mm NATO round. In 2001, weapons production ceased as MAS was absorbed into the Nexter Group. OPTSYS, a Nexter subsidiary specializing in optical equipment and protected vision for armored vehicles, is currently located in Saint-√âtienne.

It usually drains into Lake Chamo but can also drain into Lake Abaya after heavy rains through a bifurcation located directly southwest of Arba Minch Airport. The lower reaches of Kulfo River can act as the overflow channel (spillway) for Lake Abaya into Lake Chamo in case of high lake levels.

The river is connected to the Everglades through a series of man-made canals. After passing through Fort Lauderdale, the river connects to the Intracoastal Waterway and Atlantic Ocean at Port Everglades cut. The river is entirely within Broward County and is composed from the junction of three main canals which originate in the Everglades, splitting off from the Miami Canal. They are the North New River Canal, which flows south from Lake Okeechobee along the east side of U.S. 27 and then east along the north side of State Road 84 / Interstate 595; the South New River Canal, which flows east from the Miami Canal along the north side of Griffin Road and the south side of Orange Drive; and a canal which flows east along the south side of Sunrise Boulevard.  Origin of name  According to a legend attributed in 1940 to the Seminoles by writers working in the Florida Writers‚Äô Program of the Work Projects Administration, New River had appeared suddenly after a night of strong winds, loud noises, and shaking ground, resulting in the Seminoles calling the river Himmarshee, meaning \\"new water\\". The report of the Writers' Project attributed the noise and shaking to an earthquake which collapsed the roof of an underground river. Folk historian Lawrence Will relates that the Seminole name for the river was Coontie-Hatchee, for the coontie (Zamia integrifolia) that grew along the river, and that the chamber of commerce tried to change the name of the river to Himmarshee-Hatchee during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. p. 73 The English name is derived from early explorer's maps. The mouth of the river was noted for its tendency to continuously change its entry point into the Atlantic Ocean through the shifting sand of the barrier island. Each time the coast was surveyed and charted the entry point would have shifted. So the location of the mouth would not be on any previous maps, and from off the coast would appear as if it had just developed. With each charting, the location would be recorded with the notation \\"new river\\". Since that was the name used on the maps, that was the name by which the first settlers came to know it, so the name stayed. History Stranahan House, the oldest building in Fort Lauderdale, originally built as a trading post The area along the New River was occupied in prehistoric times by people of the Glades culture. At the time of first contact with Europeans, Tequesta people lived in the area. The Tequesta were gone by the middle of the 18th century. In 1788 Bahamians Charles and Frankee Lewis had established the earliest settlement along the river. The settlers fled the area with the start of the Second Seminole War, and the U.S. Army built a series of forts called Fort Lauderdale near the river. The first fort was where the North and South Forks joined. The fort was later moved to Tarpon Bend, and then to the barrier island near present-day Bahia Mar. A trading post established in the 1890s by Frank Stranahan (1864-1929) at a ferry crossing of the New River became the nucleus of the city of Fort Lauderdale. Years later, Mrs. Ivy Stranahan recollected that in the early days of the trading post, the New River was so clear that fish and even large sharks could be easily seen in its depths. Prior to the 20th century, the New River originated as two streams, the North Fork and South Fork, which merged and connected directly to the Atlantic Ocean via the now defunct New River Inlet. The river was heavily modified in the first half of the 20th century. The North Fork was extended as the C-12 Canal along present- day Sunrise Boulevard, while the South Fork was extended by two canals, one of which was the C-11 or South New River Canal, which connects to the Miami Canal. The South New River Canal also connects to the Dania Cutoff Canal, which leads eastward from the C-11 canal to the Intracoastal Waterway. North New River Canal Lock No. 1 on the North New River Canal, with modern water control structure in background The most significant extension of the New River, however, was the first, an extension of the South Fork called the North New River Canal (also known as the G-15 canal). Dredging for the canal began in 1906, not long after Napoleon B. Broward won the governorship of Florida on a promise to drain the Everglades. The canal extended approximately 42 miles south-southeast from Lake Okeechobee, then turned east-southeast and proceeded for approximately 16 miles to the former terminus of the river near what would become the Riverland section of Fort Lauderdale. The canal was completed in 1912 after construction of Lock No. 1, North New River Canal, in the southeast corner of what is today Plantation, Florida, just under 2 miles west of the current Fort Lauderdale city border. The North New River Canal served as a significant transportation route to and from the state's interior section south of Lake Okeechobee. Steamships and other boats traveled the length of the canal bringing lumber, farm equipment, and people to communities such as Okeelanta and South Bay in the area south of the lake. The boats then ferried produce from the communities' farms back to the coast, where the goods were shipped north by rail. Due to shoaling (silting) in the canal and newly constructed road and rail links to the interior section, Lock No. 1 was closed to boat traffic in 1926. The canal itself became one of South Florida's major water control systems. It is currently managed by the South Florida Water Management District. Lock No. 1 was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

Founded in 1977, it is an IUCN Category IV wildlife sanctuary, measuring over 1,000 km2 (67,400 rai; 10,784 ha) in area. South-east of, and connected with, the wildlife sanctuary is the Khao Sip Ha Chan National Park. South-west of the protection is the Khao Chamao‚ÄìKhao Wong National Park. The sanctuary is partly covered by lowland evergreen forest, along with dry and moist evergreens, mixed deciduous, deciduous dipterocarp, as well as grassland. Human-elephant conflict The Thai Department of National Parks (DNP) has estimated that in 2008 the elephant population of Khao Ang Rue Nai was just 219 animals. In recent years this number has grown by 9.83 percent per year, meaning that the reserve now has 275 or so elephants. The twenty new animals born every year exceed the death rate. Their expanding population has meant that they travel further afield in search of food. Thus the villages that border the sanctuary are subject to about 25 raids on crops per month. Due to the average crop damage of six rai per year per household, crop damage costs each household nearly 35,000 baht or 19 percent of average household income. Affected households spend an average of 212 nights awake per year guarding their fields. The DNP has resorted to various measures to reduce the conflict, including growing food crops in the forest for the animals. A spokesman for the DNP noted, on behalf of the elephants, that, \\"We are also encroaching into forest, making it harder for elephants, which already face limited food sources....it is our task not to invade their homes.\\"  Source  *Khao Angruenai in Thailand References Category:Protected areas established in 1977 Category:Wildlife sanctuaries of Thailand Category:Cardamom Mountains Category:IUCN Category IV Category:1977 establishments in Thailand ","title":"Khao Ang Rue Nai Wildlife Sanctuary"},{"id":"18073889","text":"Rendol Whidden Ganong, (October 2, 1906 - March 18, 2000) was a Canadian businessman from the Province of New Brunswick.

He was a university professor and a prominent linguist in the languages spoken by the Sami people. He is widely recognized as the founder of the studies of the Sami languages. Today he is also commonly associated with his novel, Lajla: A New Tale of Finmark which became the basis for Laila, a 1929 silent film.Lajla: A New Tale of Finmark (G.P. Putnam. 1888) Retrieved June 20, 2016Svenn-Egil Knutsen Duollj√° Jens Andreas Friis (Store norske leksikon) Background Friis was born in Sogndal in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. He was the son of church vicar Soren Hjelm Friis (1781-1856) and Charlotte Lovise Cammermeyer (1789-1869). He was the brother of priest and politician Nicolai Friis. Friis completed his final exams from M√∏llers Institute in Christiania in 1840 and earned his cand.theol. in 1844. From 1847-49, he was a research fellow in Sami and Finnish. By the autumn of 1849, he went on a grant to Kajaani, Finland to continue his studies under L√∂nnrot Elias, the founder of Finnish folklore studies. Friis stayed for a time in Finnmark and in return he assumed teaching ministry for priests. Career Friis was appointed reader in Sami languages at the University of Kristiania (now University of Oslo) in 1863. Three years later he was awarded a chair in the Lapp and Kven languages, with a special duty in translation. He published on the Sami language and mythology as well as travel literature about Northern Norway. Friis established the northern Sami orthography, which although modified through three spelling reforms is in common usage. Until the Konrad Nielsen's dictionary Lappisk ordbok was published in three volumes between 1932 and 1938, Friis' Sami dictionary was the most important of its kind. Friis also translated With Nansen over Greenland in 1888: My journey from Lapland to Greenland by Samuel Balto from the original Sami into the Norwegian language. Friis' ethographical maps Friis published three series of thematic maps covering Norway north of the Ofotfjord. First edition in 1861, second in 1888/1890. Each household was coded by a trivariate symbology denoting (1) ethnic group (2) household member's fluency in the Norwegian, Sami and Kven language and (3) whether the family lived in a goahti. These maps, in addition to the censuses of 1865, 1875, 1891 and 1900 provide a valuable resource of knowledge of the ethnicity and language in the circumpolar region decades before the enforcement of Norwegian as the single official language in schools.

The force was set up by the British Military Administration which took over the administration of Malaya from the Japanese Imperial Army when the latter surrendered in August 1945.Civil Affairs Police Force (Malay language) The establishment of CAPF in September 1945 was an important development in the history of the police force. It was the first time a single, centrally administered police force was set up for the entire British Malaya. Prior to the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945, several police forces existed in the region. The force was led by Commissioner of Police H. B. Longworthy. As an initial step to restore the police force, all existing police officers were sent for intensive training courses at the newly built police training centre in Kuala Lumpur. By 1946, a total of 1,512 police officers from all over Malaya had completed the Refresher Courses at the training centre. In January 1946, CAPF began accepting new recruits.

Special education In December 2010, Eastern York School District administration reported that 435 pupils or 16% of the District's pupils received Special Education services, with 47.6% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, Eastern York School District's administration reported that 430 pupils or 16% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with % of the identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the Eastern York School District. Parents may also contact the District's Special Education Department directly at the administration offices. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Eastern York School District received a $1,743,378 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= Eastern York School District Administration reported that 74 or 2.91% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy The Eastern York School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246.Eastern York School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2011, the average teacher salary in Eastern York School District had increased to $60,426.09 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $13,387.58 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $73,813.66.

In 2010, Eastern York Administration reported an increase to $2,832,280.00 in the unreserved-undesignated fund and $2,740,000 in its Unreserved - Designated Fund. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 Per Pupil spending In 2008, Eastern York School District administration reported that per pupil spending was $12,427 which ranked 230th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts.

A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Eastern York School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Eastern York School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,663.74, High School - $10,230.63. In June 2012, the Eastern York School Board cut $814,000 from the administration's proposed 2012-13 budget, by reducing the technology budget, reducing the buildings and grounds budget, reducing estimated utility costs, eliminating an elementary librarian position, eliminating a career counselor at the high school, eliminating one special education teacher at the high school and reducing summer help.

Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2008-09, Eastern York School District applied for and received $432,094 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The District used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for 243 students for the 4th year. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use.

Race to the Top Eastern York School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district up to hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, Governor's Press release January 20, 2010 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Central Yorkg was one of six York County school districts that applied to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, Governor's Press Office, January 20, 2010. Pennsylvania was not approved in the first round of the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. A second round of state RTTT application judging will occur in June 2010.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012‚Äì13 were set by the Eastern York School Board at 19.3500 mills.Garman, Wendy., Eastern budget includes tax hike, The York Dispatch, June 22, 2012 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 19.0500 mills *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 18.8500 mills *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 18.3400 mills. *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 18.3400 mills. *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 17.3800 mills. *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 16.1000 mills. *2005‚Äì06 ‚Äì 19.2000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by York County residents amounts to about 4.01% of their yearly income. York County ranked 232nd of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each public school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, Eastern York School Board applied for three exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special educations costs, pension costs and Maintenance of Selected Revenue Sources. Each year, Eastern York School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì12 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. Eastern York School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2010-11. For 2009‚Äì10 school budget, the board also did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.Scarcella, Frank and Pursell, Tricia, Local school tax assessments exceed state averages. The Daily Item, May 25, 2010 Property tax relief In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Eastern York School District was $131 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 4,262 property owners applied for the tax relief.Tax Relief per Homestead 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report May 1, 2010 In 2009, the district's property tax relief amount was set at $133 to 5,444 approved homestead owners. In 2010 within York County, the highest amount went to York City School District set at $495 per approved homestead. The property tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead 5-1-10. Report Pennsylvania Department of Education, May 2010 This was the second year they were the top recipient. In Pennsylvania, the homestead exclusion reduces the assessed values of homestead properties, reducing the property tax on these homes. The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially greater than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

The aerodrome is owned by defence company BAE Systems which uses the site for manufacturing of several aircraft types. Currently BAE employ approximately 3,000 people at the site. The aerodrome is part of Lancashire Enterprise Zone. History The origins of the site, which was once an active aerodrome, date back to 1922 when it was proposed that a municipal airfield be constructed to serve the nearby towns of Blackburn and Preston. However, construction did not commence on the airfield until April 1939, then accelerated because of the Second World War, when the Air Ministry instructed the English Electric Company (EE) to proceed with the construction of flight shed number 1. The first of the Handley Page Hampdens built by EE made its maiden flight on 22 February 1940, and by 1942 770 Hampdens had been delivered from Samlesbury. In 1940, a second factory was built and the runway was extended so that construction of the Handley Page Halifax could begin. By 1945, all five main hangars and three runways had been completed. During the war, the site was also home to some of Hawker Hurricanes and Airspeed Oxfords that were under the command of No. 9 Group RAF. By the end of the war, over 3,000 bombers had been built and flown from Samlesbury. After the war, such aircraft as the De Havilland Vampire, the English Electric Canberra (the first aircraft designed and built wholly by English Electric) and the English Electric Lightning were built on the site. The site has also produced parts for the Anglo-French Concorde and the ill-fated TSR2 project. When English Electric merged to become BAC and later British Aerospace, it worked closely with the nearby sister plant at BAE Warton, and the former BAE factory in Preston on building the Sepecat Jaguar and Panavia Tornado fighter aircraft. In 2009, 635 Volunteer Gliding Squadron of the Royal Air Force moved its operation to RAF Topcliffe. Motor gliding no longer takes place at Samlesbury because of the airfield's closure. The aerodrome's ICAO code of EGNG has been reassigned to Bagby airfield in Yorkshire. Aerial picture of Samlesbury Aerodrome. (April 2014) BAE Systems use Today, the Samlesbury facility is a high technology BAE Systems manufacturing and aerospace facility. Spirit AeroSystems also occupies a small area of Samlesbury after the BAE Systems Aerostructures business was sold to Spirit AeroSystems in 2006. Spirit manufactures parts for the Airbus and other civil platforms at the site. The current site, which employs over 3,000 people, builds the fuselage and other parts for the Eurofighter Typhoon and other aircraft including the F-35 Lightning II and the T-45 Goshawk. The site has also seen the construction of a large block to house BAE office staff. The airstrip is no longer active, part of the runway has been removed, with the Academy for Skills & Knowledge (ASK) now occupying where it once stood. During 2006, BAE Systems transferred ownership of the site to its Pension Fund Scheme. There are now ongoing plans to develop a high tech aerospace business park on the airfield. Phase One of the building works began in November 2007, projected to take a year to complete. In 2008, work began on the construction of a new main entrance and visitor's centre at the western boundary of the site; this is now in operation. Until recently the site had two gate guards, adjacent to the old site entrance. One was a Lightning F.53 (ZF580), removed in February 2013. The Lightning was painted in generic RAF aircraft markings as worn after return from the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) where it bore serial 53-672. This was returned to the United Kingdom around 1986 (with 2,305 flying hours) when British Aerospace sold Tornado aircraft to the RSAF as part of the Al Yamamah deal. The removal of the Lightning was met with \\"local anger\\". Until November 2009, there was also a Canberra PR.7 (WT537) as a gate guard but this has been removed for restoration at the (now closed) RAF Millom Aviation and Military Museum at Haverigg, Cumbria. A full size plastic F-35 Lightning II and a plastic English Electric Lightning (created using a mould from the original plane) were installed as the site's gate guard in the summer of 2015. In April 2015, after closure of the remaining airfield runway, a solar farm consisting of 9,000 solar panels, was installed at the site. By 2016, it had prevented over a million kilogrammes () of carbon being released into the atmosphere, and had saved ¬£300,000 in energy costs. Enterprise zone Since February 2012, the aerodrome has provided one of the two sites of Lancashire Enterprise Zone; the other site being at BAE Systems' Warton Aerodrome. The zone's site at Samlesbury covers . BAE Systems, Lancashire County Council and Lancashire Enterprise Partnership coordinate the site's development.

In 1970, Dr. Cruz worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine in 1970. She worked with many biochemists and began her research on Conus geographus, a venomous fish- hunting species found in the waters of Marinduque and Mindoro of the Philippines. This species was known for its stinging property that causes illnesses and even death among fishermen. Dr. Cruz worked on the isolation of peptides from the conotoxins in the snail's venom when their effects were still unknown. Her research shed light on the effects of conotoxins on the central nervous system and how it can cause muscular paralysis, sleepiness, or drowsiness, involuntary motion and more. Today, conotoxin peptides are very important and they are extensively used biochemical probes such as to test calcium channels in neurons and prohibitory of muscular movement when investigation actions at synapses.

History Both \\"Im Nin'Alu\\" and \\"Galbi\\" were originally recorded for the 1984 album Yemenite Songs also known as Fifty Gates of Wisdom containing modern versions of traditional Yemeni Jewish songs, recorded with drum machines and synthesizers but still with comparatively traditional arrangements and instruments, including strings, woodwind and brass as well as distinctive percussion like Yemeni tin and tambala. =Remixes= Contrary to popular belief, \\"Im Nin'Alu\\" was not the first track from the Yemenite Songs album to be remixed for the dancefloor - in fact it was the other way around. \\"Galbi\\" was the first remix to be issued in Israel in 1984 on the Hed Arzi label, then subtitled \\"Played Out Mix\\", remixed and re-produced by Izhar Ashdot and clearly influenced by contemporary American dance productions like Chaka Khan's groundbreaking \\"I Feel For You\\" with its prominent use of samples, editing, breakbeats and scratching. The \\"Played Out Mix\\" which more or less only retained the lead vocals and the string section of the original recording was released both as a 7\\" and an extended 12\\" single which later found its way to both Continental Europe and the UK via the independent world music label Globe Style Records in 1985 and became something of an underground club hit. The B-side of the 1985 12\\" single was in fact the original un- remixed version of \\"Im Nin'Alu\\" with its a cappella intro - which may be an explanation as to why the world of British dance music and American hip hop was exposed to the somewhat exotic genre Yemeni Jewish folk music and the sample of Haza's voice later appearing on tracks like Coldcut's \\"Seven Minutes of Madness\\" remix of Eric B. & Rakim's \\"Paid in Full\\" and M/A/R/R/S' \\"Pump Up the Volume\\", both milestones in the history of dance music and both released in 1987. In 1987, \\"Galbi\\" was again remixed, then in the Netherlands by Dutch DJ Peter Vriends and re-issued as a 12\\" single on the minor label Street Heat with the subtitle \\"The Dutch Remix\\", also including the 1984 Israeli \\"Played Out\\" remix. Following the pop chart success of \\"Im Nin'Alu (Played in Full Remix)\\" in the summer of 1988, again remixed and re-produced by Izhar Ashdot, also with the assistance of British engineer Bob Kraushaar, \\"Galbi\\" was remixed a second time by Ashdot in the autumn of that year, then with an arrangement similar to the million-selling hit single. The \\"88' Remix\\" of \\"Galbi\\" which also included re-recorded vocals partly in English was first available on the Shaday album and subsequently issued as the follow-up single to \\"Im Nin'Alu (Played in Full)\\" in the UK, Continental Europe, Scandinavia, the U.S. and Japan. For the 1988 7\\" single release, Ashdot mixed two vocal 7\\" mixes, one with the original Yemeni vocals and the other the re-recorded Yemeni/English version. For the 1988 12\\"/CD single, he created the extended \\"Sehoog Mix\\" (later appearing as a bonus track on Sire Records' CD re-release of the Shaday album), a second 12\\" mix called \\"88 Maxi Mix\\" (only commercially released in France), as well as an alternate 12\\" instrumental. Sire Records, the U.S. licensee of the Shaday album, then in turn commissioned further remixes from American and British producers such as Pascal Gabriel in late 1988 which found their way on to the U.S. 12\\" singles (which also included the Israeli \\"Played Out\\" remixes, by then already four years old, and \\"The Dutch Remix\\") as well as to 'various artists' dance albums and sampler compilations like Just Say Yo in the Just Say Yes series. Further remixes have followed all throughout the 1990s and 2000s - both on official albums, white label 12\\" singles, DJ compilations by Razormaid, Disconet, Hot Tracks, Ultimix and DMC as well as bootleg remix compilations. The latest official remix of \\"Galbi\\" was included on the 2008 album Forever Ofra Haza - Her Greatest Songs Remixed, then remixed and re-produced by German production team Ferris Bueller and Kai Panschow, issued on the Edel Records label.

It is located just southwest of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue. The cemetery is invisible from the street, being located in the middle of a city block and ringed by homes and stores. It is accessible only through a small alleyway between two stores on Yonge Street. The gates to the cemetery are also usually kept locked. History The city's oldest surviving Catholic cemetery, it opened in 1855. It replaced St. Paul's Cemetery at Queen and Parliament, which had been filled to capacity by the recent influx of Irish Catholic settlers. Some 29,000 people are buried at St. Michael's. It is the final resting place mostly for working-class Irish Canadians. St. Michael's remained the only Catholic cemetery in Toronto until 1900 when it was near capacity, and the Mount Hope Cemetery was opened. One of the most notable features of the cemetery is the octagonal mortuary vault designed by Joseph Sheard, who later became mayor of Toronto. Notable interments Some notable figures are interred there including brewer Eugene O'Keefe and Victoria Cross recipient Denis Dempsey.

It was built on the site of the previous Bromford Forge railway station which had been opened by the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway on its new line to Lawley Street railway station in 1842. It was on the line from Water Orton and was reopened in 1896, the line by then being connected to Birmingham New Street. It was only used to serve the nearby racecourse, the platforms being on the goods lines to which the \\"specials\\" could be brought, clear of the running lines. It closed in 1965 when the racecourse closed. The name \\"Bromford Bridge\\" comes from the bridge over the River Tame, before which the river was crossed by a ford, hence \\"Bromford\\". The original station, Bromford Forge, was on the same level as the road, which crossed the railway on the level. At that time the track was just double. It was quadrupled later. As traffic increased, the level crossing became inconvenient, so the long viaduct was built, carrying Bromford Lane over the railway. If you look down from Bromford Lane you can still see remains of the original road. The south platform was originally an island, with tracks on both sides. In the photograph above you can see where the additional tracks used to be. The signalbox was not sited there at the time. Beyond that platform there was a terminal platform for unloading horses, and an entrance from there directly into the racecourse. It was used only for horses and dignitaries: the public had no access. On at least one occasion the Royal Train was backed into that platform. On the other side of Bromford Lane to the station there was a public footpath alongside the railway, which led to the Metropolitan-Cammell factory, and was well used by the staff there.

It was the first engineering society to be formed anywhere in the world, and remains the oldest. History The first known formal meeting of civil engineers in Britain took place at the King's Head tavern in Holborn, London, on 15 March 1771, when seven of the leading engineers of the time agreed to establish a Society of Civil Engineers. The leading light of the new Society was John Smeaton who was the first engineer to describe himself as a \\"Civil Engineer\\", having coined the term to distinguish himself from the military engineers graduating from the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. The other founding members were Thomas Yeoman, Robert Mylne, Joseph Nickalls, John Grundy, John Thompson and James King. In the first year they were joined by John Golborne, William Black, Robert Whitworth and Hugh Henshall and these eleven were known as the Original Members. When the Society was founded its title was the \\"Society of Civil Engineers\\". When William Mylne started a new Minute Book in 1822 he used the heading \\"Engineers' Society\\" in the reports of each session until 1869, when he changed it to \\"Smeatonian Society\\". The Rules and Regulations issued in 1830 bore the title \\"Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers\\" for the first time, which has been its title ever since. Major Henry Watson was the first military engineer to be elected to membership in 1774. Eventually the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers became more of a dining club and a group of younger engineers began to demand a better grouping to aid their profession and the Institution of Civil Engineers was formed in 1818. The unveiling of a memorial stone to Smeaton in Westminster Abbey on 7 November 1994, by Noel Ordman, President, was described in The Times as 'a triumph for the Smeatonian Society'. Smeaton is also one of six civil engineers depicted in the Stephenson stained glass window, designed by William Wailes and unveiled in 1862. Present day The Society continues to this day, mainly as a dining and discussion club of around sixty senior professional engineers, 'distinguished for their work in the theory or practice of design, manufacture, construction or management in the various fields of engineering', up to eighteen retired Members Emeritus and up to fifteen Honorary Members who include Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (elected 1953), who served as President in 1971, and Anne, Princess Royal (elected 2017). Since 1975 the Society has often met at the headquarters of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Mottos The Latin motto \\"Omnia in Numero, Pondere et Mensura\\" was added to the summons card in 1793; it is adapted from Wisdom of Solomon 11:20 \\"(Thou hast ordered) all things by number, weight and measure\\". The proposal of the Reverend William Whewell (Honorary Member 1836) at a meeting on 14 June 1843 was accepted, that a Greek motto (probably from Aristotle) should be added to the summons card: \\"Œ§ŒµœáŒΩŒ∑ Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒøœÖŒºŒµŒΩ ·Ω¢ŒΩ œÜœÖœÉŒµŒπ ŒΩŒπŒ∫œâŒºŒµŒ∏Œ±\\" ‚ÄúBy Art we master what would master us‚Äù. Both mottos are still in use. Historical membership classes From 1793 the renewed Society was to be \\"for promoting and communicating every branch of knowledge useful and necessary to the various and important branches of public and private works in civil engineering\\". There were three classes of membership: First Class - \\"those who are actually employed in Designing, & forming, Works of different kinds, in the Various Departments of Engineering\\". Second Class - \\"Men of Science and Gentlemen of Fame and Fortune\\" (Honorary Members). Third Class - \\"Various Artists, whose professions and employments, are necessary & useful thereto as well as connected with Civil Engineering\\" (Honorary Members). Women elected include Jean Venables (2003), Joanna Kennedy (2006), Julia Elton FSA (Honorary 2010), Dame Julia Higgins (2012), Bridget Rosewell (2016), Dame Ann Dowling (2017), Helen Atkinson (2017), Dame Judith Hackitt (2018) and Faith Wainwright (2019).  Presidents  The following is a list of presidents of the Society from its inception. Honorary Members are shown in italics. In 1793 the Society was reconstituted without a President.

W. Anson, F. J. Ormeling, International Cartographic Association (1993). Basic cartography for students and technicians. Vol. 1. p. 18  Life and work  Youth = Market place in Stadthagen. Crome was born into a middle-class family. His father Johann Friedrich Crome (1724-1802) was first headmaster in Stadthagen, then pastor, and later superintendent and official in the village of Sengwarden (allegedly he had two legendary encounters with the devil). His mother Christiane Lucretia, born B√ºsching, was a pastor's daughter from Stadthagen. In his autobiography (1833) Crome praised the simple life at home, which gave him \\"a good foundation for a physically strong constitution. Its pure unadulterated sense was connected with true religion of the heart.\\" Together with his brother Heinrich he was tutored by his father until university entrance. His brother Heinrich later studied law in G√∂ttingen and became a lawyer in Kniphausen. Thanks to the financial help of his uncle, the geographer, historian, educator and theologian Anton Friedrich B√ºsching in Berlin, the Count of Bentinck, and the church of his father, Crome was able to study in theology from 1772 to 1774 at the University of Halle. Through teaching at the Latin school of the orphanage, he earned money for lunch and dinner, and gained his first teaching experience. = Private tutor in Berlin and Brandenburg = After his years at the University of Halle, Crome became private tutor for some time in Berlin and Brandenburg. He continued his theological studies, preached frequently, as he wrote \\"not without applause\\", and passed upon a trial sermon for his theological examination. He didn't accept a position offered as a pastor, but remained a private tutor instead, as of May 1775, at the home of Baron von Bismarck in Sch√∂nhausen. One of his pupils was the father of the future Chancellor. Crome's uncle B√ºsching introduced him to the Berlin Enlightenment circle around Moses Mendelssohn and Christoph Friedrich Nicolai. Crome later reported anecdotally, that one day he had been invited by his uncle in Berlin to present an afternoon trial sermon on the \\"value of suffering\\" in the presence of several civil servants. In the foregoing of lunch it however turned into a dispute about the recent published epistolary novel The Sorrows of Young Werther, on which B√ºsching sharply disapproved, but was defended by Crome. His uncle angry left the lunch table, and Crome was late for church, but then delivered a sermon which reconciled his uncle - so that the Sorrows of Werther would have no lasting fatal effect. = Teacher in Dessau = Instead of the priest profession, Crome choose a teacher career and taught from 1779 at the Philanthropinum in Dessau, especially in the fields of geography and history. Here he also wrote his first publication, entitled \\"√úber das Verh√§ltnis des Erziehers zu seinen Z√∂glingen\\" (On the relationship of the teacher to his pupils). Crome also promoted the ideas for Jewish emancipation of his friend Christian Wilhelm von Dohm. Another of his respected colleague was Christian Gotthilf Salzmann. = Products Map of Europe = Neue Carte von Europa, 1782: For every country is a listing of products. Detail of Crome's 1782 map: Codes on the map locate production areas. In Dessau Crome developed the work, which would make his fame: the first product map of Europe (1782), entitled \\"Neue Carte Von Europa welche die merkw√ºrdigsten Producte und vornehmsten Handelspl√§ze nebst dem Fl√§chen-Inhalt aller Europ√§ischer L√§nder in deutschen Quadrat-Meilen enth√§lt\\" (New map of Europe which contains the strangest and most prestigious products of trading places together with the surface content of all European countries in German square miles). This map showed for all parts of Europe a recordings of prominent goods and services produced. The map received very positive reception, including a review by Georg Forster, and proved to be a financial success for Crome. Today this map is considered to be the earliest economic thematic map.Robinson, A.H., Early thematic mapping in the history of cartography. Chicago, 1982. p. 54-55.A.H. Konrad, 1995. Mapp√¶ Bavari√¶: thematische Karten von Bayern bis zum Jahr 1900 : sonderausstellung des Deutschen Museums M√ºnchen. Ivan Kupƒç√≠k, Deutsches Museum (Germany). p. 34 Crome started living as private scholar and writer. He published geographic and statistical works and studied the general theory of the state. After statistical analysis of available data, he foresaw the economic rise of the United States and defended their right to independence. In 1783 in Dessau he met the French Enlightenment writer Guillaume Thomas Fran√ßois Raynal. The honors he received included membership in the Imperial Free Economic Society to St. Petersburg and the Academy of Public Sciences to Erfurt, as well as the philosophical honorary doctorate from the University of G√∂ttingen. The appeal to join the Imperial Academy of Sciences (until 1934 in Saint Petersburg), he refused. = Other remarkable maps = In the next decennia Crome made a number of other remarkable maps. Starting in 1784, Crome published a road map from the journey from Leipzig to Magdeburg, entitled \\"Reise-Karte von Leipzig nach Magdeburg\\". The next year in 1785 he published historically one of the first statistical maps, and one of the first comparison diagrams. This map, entitled \\"Groessen-Karte von Europa, welche den Fl√§chen-Inhalt und die Volksmenge der vorz√ºglichsten europ√§ischen Staaten und L√§nder enth√§lt,\\" compared the size of the countries and the size of its population of all states and countries in Europe. This map was another example of a new representations in political economy, and would inspire a new generation of cartographers, such as Alexander von Humboldt in Germany,David N. Livingstone,Charles W. J. Withers. Geography and Enlightenment. 2010. p. 252Nicolaas A. Rupke (2000), Medical History: Supplement. Nr. 20, p. 171. and Charles Dupin in France.Palsky, Gilles. \\"Connections and Exchanges in European Thematic Cartography. The case of XIXth century choropleth maps.\\" Formatting Europe. Mapping a continent. 2007 In the years 1818 Comte published a new extended version of his then 25-year-old map \\"Groessen-Karte von Europa,\\" under the new title \\"Verh√§ltniss=Karte von Europa.\\" This map was accompanied by the 1818 publication of the book \\"Allgemeine Uebersicht der Staatskr√§fte von den s√§mmtlichen europ√§ischen Reichen und L√§ndern,\\" in which the subject and the map content was further explained. In compare to the 1785 map, a series of pie charts were added in a separate frame. This was in Europe one of the first applications of the pie chart, which William Playfair had introduced in his \\"Statistical Breviary\\" in 1801. = Professor in Giessen = In 1787 Crome accepted professorship at the University of Giessen, partly offered to him partly because of his rhetorical talent. On the road, he briefly visited Weimar and met Christoph Martin Wieland and Johann Karl August Mus√§us. His Latin inaugural treated the relationship between politics and statistics. More than 40 years (until 1830) he practiced the professorship at the same place despite numerous calls from Berlin, Leipzig, G√∂ttingen, Marburg, Greifswald, Basel and others. His scientific achievements as reformer in the field of mercantilism were less driven by theoretical originality, but rather through practical usefulness, educational preparation and thoroughness. He constantly developed new methods of statistical representation, including one of the first bar charts and area charts. His political concern was the Enlightenment, the defense of press freedom and public education, in particular by free availability of statistical data. = Diplomatic activity = August Crome, 1796 In 1790 Crome had joined, at his request as consulting scholar, the Saxony legislate that traveled to Frankfurt to meet Leopold II. A friend reported him unsolicited for an audience. The Emperor, to that date, Grand Duke of Tuscany, commissioned him after a lively conversation to translate and annotate his work \\"Governo della Toscana\\". As a reward, he was promised one of the five prebends of the Protestant founders. His son and successor of Francis II, after another audience, would delivered that promise. Among the 1,000 subscribers of the subsequently published work by Crome were 70 ruling princes. In 1797 French troops occupied the Upper Hesse and moved their headquarters to Giessen. To General Bernadotte, who took command in Giessen in 1798, Crome build a good relationship and became his frequent dinner guest. As a member of a so-called \\"War on Land Commission\\", which had to mediate between the people and the occupiers, Crome, among other things prevented the looting of the University Library in 1799. After the end of the occupation Crome was commissioned to negotiation of a pacification treaty with Bernadotte in Mainz, whereby a renewed occupation of Hesse-Darmstadt, should be prevented. On the advice of Crome the French changed their plans and chose instead of Darmstadt, at that time only weakly occupied by the Austrians, Mannheim as their headquarters. The secret pacification treaty with the Landlords was completed. Crome continued negotiations in Mannheim, and became an intimate in the circles of the French generals and politicians. His youngest sister Christiana Dorothea married in 1799 the French staff officer and later Baron de Larroque. = Marriage = Crome married in 1805, at the age of 52 years, with Demoiselle Dorette Wagner (1778-1857). She was a nice of captain Carl Ludwig Buff (1769-1841) in Wetzlar, a longtime friend Crome. In their house he had seen his future bride for the first time. Carl Ludwig Buff was the older brother of Charlotte Buff, the novelist of Werther, and the father of chemist Heinrich Buff. Crome's marriage remained childless. His far younger wife survived him by 19 years. = Scandal around political writings = In his journal Germania Crome had acknowledge to be supporter of the Confederation of the Rhine, whom he praised as a rational creation. Due to his behavior in the year 1813 he became subject to severe attacks. On request of the French headquarters, he had written the essay, entitled \\"Deutschlands Crise und Errettung im April und May 1813\\" (Crises in Germany and salvation in April and May 1813), which was released from draft. He advocated peace with France, warned for a revolutionary war in Germany and the destruction of the German- Franconian culture by a Russian-Asian coalition. He saw France as the protective power for Germany against the East, promised peace to the continent, and foresaw the flourishing of the continental economy and culture with a Napoleonic victory against Great Britain. The German people must preserve peace and order and follow its ruling king. After the victory of the coalition at Leipzig, Crome subsequently became subject of massive attacks from the Rheinischer Merkur newspaper from Koblenz. Particularly Joseph G√∂rres and Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher called him a \\"scoundrel\\". On charges of treason Fatherland, among others by August von Kotzebue, even a death threat followed, and finally the burning on Crome's writings by radical nationalist students at the Wartburg Festival in 1817. In his 1817 book \\"Deutschlands und Europas Staats- und Nationalinteresse\\" (Germany and Europe Heads of State and National Interest), Crome expressed an altered view without commenting his change of opinion. He lashed out at the infamous French secret police, and warned now against an foreign protector power. Heinrich von Treitschke commented that, the \\"infamous Bonapartist\\" only dressed up with the mantle of German patriotism. From the perspective of modern research, it could be considered a pragmatic and rationalistic perspective, that Crome advocates a cautious reform policy of small steps. In the first session of the State Parliament of Hesse (1821) Crome received much sympathy, particularly for the public presenting his views.

History  In Cleveland, Tennessee, the Church of God started the Bible Training School which later became Lee College and is now Lee University. This higher education institution sponsored \\"The Church of God Hour\\" on the local radio stations and featured a 40 voice mixed choir, which has had several directors, including Harold Cato, Y.H. Yates, and Roosevelt Miller. In 1958, A.T. Humphries divided the Mixed Choir into two distinct organizations ‚Äì a touring choir and the Campus Choir. Dr. David Horton was appointed as the director of Campus Choir in 1983. Starting with 58 students, the choir grew into an enrollment of 150 students. The decision was made to begin auditions and to limit the size of the choir to around 100 students, and the choir would begin to travel to local churches and sing an arrangement of choral music. Another influence at this time was the creation of Choral Union with the purpose of performing the great oratorios. Years later, Dr. Horton decided to make worship the main focus of the Lee University Campus Choir, and remains the focus of the choir to this day. With several releases to their name, The Comforter Has Come was the final project under the direction of Dr. Horton, who had been director for 25 years until his death in 2006. Since his death, the choir has been directed by Dr. Mark Bailey and Pastor Jimmy Phillips, respectfully. The leadership has now been passed to Dr. Luke Gambill since the resignation of Pastor Jimmy Phillips in September 2020.  Directors  * A.T.

She has been a fellow at the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, at the University of Bielefeld (1991‚Äì1992), the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne (2004‚Äì2005), the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin (1993‚Äì1994), and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2010).

In her more recent articles, she has argued that the search for a unified, reductionist Theory of Everything is futile. Instead, she suggests that the sciences focus on studying the complex correlations between elements and their emergent effects (self-organization) that, as she argues, a strictly reductionist approach is not able to adequately address.\\"Die Weltformel ist tot\\", in Der Spiegel, 2008-05-30 , retrieved 2008-06-22 Bibliography *1997 (edited with Peter Weingart, Peter Richerson, Sabine Maasen): Human by Nature: Between Biology and the Social Sciences, Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. *2002 (edited with John Earman, Clark Glymour): Ceteris Paribus Laws.

It was the site of an interracial community from the Civil War until 1911, when the residents were forcibly evicted from the island. It is now an uninhabited reserve owned and managed by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust. Public daytime access is permitted. History The Casco Bay Breeze and other newspapers investigated during the 1890s, then printed stories about a \\"degenerate colony\\" whose indiscretions included use of tobacco and of tea. The towns of Phippsburg and Harpswell fought not to take control over the settlement, but to build a hotel for business, and in 1905 the State of Maine took responsibility for this poor island community that nobody wanted. The state built a school and furnished a schoolteacher and began focusing its attention on the unorthodox community. While some saw improvement in the island, Governor Frederick W. Plaisted saw blight on his state‚Äôs reputation. Under the Governor's direction, Maine's authorities abducted and removed men, women, and children many of whom were forced into various institutions and, in 1912, undertook the mass eviction of the remaining 45-member interracial community. To discourage resettlement, Maine authorities eventually even dug up the graves, and took the dead for burial at the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded in Pownal. The island was legally owned by Eli Perry, and the residents were squatters, although they had lived there for decades. In 1911, the Perry family ordered the residents to leave. The state then bought the island and evicted the islanders, paying them a relocation stipend. One family of seven and one other person were deemed feeble-minded and placed in an institution, although the accuracy of their diagnosis is disputed.http://www.andreabrand.com/sebasco/history.htm Missionaries helping the Islanders had negotiated to buy the island from the Perry family in order to allow the residents to stay, but the governor outbid them and then evicted the residents. The governor's motivation is unclear, as he had previously pledged to help the community. It is speculated that this was a personal retribution against the missionaries, who had defeated him in a bitter political fight over Prohibition.http://www.malagaislandmaine.org/audio.htm On April 7, 2010, Maine legislators finally issued an official statement of regret for the Malaga incident, but did so without notifying descendants and other stakeholders either before or after the fact. The \\"public\\" apology didn't become known to the public until nearly four months later, when an article appeared in a monthly magazine, Down East, which also procured a statement of regret by Governor John Baldacci. In 2012, a retrospective exhibit at the Maine State Museum was opened by governor Paul LePage.

The strong two-bid was the cornerstone of the Culbertson system.) is an opening bid of two in a suit, i.e. 2, 2, 2 or 2 . It is a natural bid, used to show a hand that is too strong to open at the one level. Commonly used in the early days of bridge, most expert players converted after World War II to the now more common weak two bid retaining only 2 as a strong opening suit-bid and changing its meaning to artificial and forcing holding any suit. This was done on the basis that the weak two-bid would occur much more frequently. In Standard American bidding, Charles Goren advocated that a strong two-bid should indicate a five- card suit with 25 high card points (HCP), a six-card suit with 23 HCP, or a seven-card suit with 21 HCP and is to game. In Acol, the main bidding system in the United Kingdom, strong two bids are still used by many players. The 2, 2 and 2 opening bids show hands which are so strong that if partner passed an opening one-bid with less than 6 points, game might be missed, but which are not strong enough to force to game if partner has nothing at all. They are based on one or two long strong suits with some outside strength, with eight or nine playing tricks, and typically have about four losers and at least 16 points, usually more. The 2 bid is retained for an even stronger hand which is game forcing. Modern Acol players frequently use both weak twos and strong twos, by adopting Benjamin two-bids or the Multi 2 diamonds. Responses Normally, a strong two bid is forcing for at least one round. Possible responses are: *A 2NT response is negative, showing a weak hand (six points or fewer in Standard American). All other responses are positive; in Acol these require 8 or more points or an Ace-King, i.e. 1¬Ω quick tricks. *Raise partner's suit with 3-card support. *Bid a new suit with some values and 5+ cards in the new suit *Bid 3NT with good values and a balanced hand. Some Acol players allow a strong two bid (not 2) to be passed. This means they can't safely be used for two-suited hands. NotesReferences * * Really Easy Bidding.

It was built in about 1620 and altered and enlarged in about 1916. The house is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England. Early in the 20th century, the house was the childhood home of the Mitford sisters. History John-Freeman Mitford Asthall Manor is a vernacular two-storey house with attics, built of local Cotswold limestone on an irregular H-plan with mullioned and mullioned-transomed windows and a stone-slated roof typical of the area. There are records of a house on the site since 1272 when Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, owned a house on the site worth 12d. In 1304 the curia, garden and fish pond were valued at 10 shillings. The core of the current building at Asthall was built in 1620 for Sir William Jones on the site of the mediaeval hall. In 1688 the estate was sold to Sir Edmund Fettiplace; it stayed in branches of the same family for the next 130 years when it was sold to John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale in 1810. During their 116-year tenure the Freeman-Mitfords made many alterations to the house including the installation in 1899 of an electric power system powered by a water turbine fed by the River Windrush. The architect Charles Bateman altered and enlarged the house in 1916. In 1920 a former barn was converted to a ballroom and joined to the main house by a cloister. In 1926 the house was sold to Thomas Hardcastle and was purchased by the current owners in 1997 on the death of Hardcastle's son. The Mitford sisters David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale (2nd creation), father of the Mitford sisters, inherited Asthall Manor on the death of his father in 1916 and in 1919 moved his family there from Batsford Park. The two youngest of the Mitford sisters, Jessica and Deborah, later Duchess of Devonshire, were born at Asthall in 1917 and 1920 respectively. Their sister Diana had an appendectomy on the spare-bedroom table. The Mitfords were great socialites, and Asthall hosted frequent hunting and shooting weekend parties, regular guests included Clementine Churchill, Frederick Lindemann and Walter Sickert. Nancy Mitford's fictional Alconleigh in The Pursuit of Love is based largely on Asthall, and family life there is described in Jessica Mitford's autobiographical Hons and Rebels. Redesdale had never planned to make Asthall Manor a permanent home, and in 1926 the family moved into nearby Swinbrook House which Redesdale had had built on the site of a derelict farm. The Mitfords subsequently leased 26 Rutland Gate in London's Knightsbridge district following the sale of Asthall. Garden The garden at Asthall Manor covers . It was created for the current owners of Asthall by Julian and Isobel Bannerman (best known for their work for Prince Charles at Highgrove House) and includes traditional gardens of herbaceous borders and lawns, contemporary parterres and areas of wild woodland and wildflowers running down to water- meadows by the River Windrush. Asthall today Asthall Manor remains primarily a private family home, although the ballroom is occasionally used for functions and Asthall Manor's garden provides the setting for \\"On Form\\",On Form website a biennial exhibition of contemporary sculpture in stone as well as small outdoor musical events.

Other common names include omubambanjobe (Tooro Uganda), acacia Saint Domingue (French), el marab√∫ (Cuba), \\" Mpangara\\" (Shona), Kalahari-Weihnachtsbaum (German of former South West Africa), k√©k√© or mimosa clochette (R√©union). Etymology The generic name Dichrostachys means 'two-colored spike', referring to its two-colored inflorescence, from the Ancient Greek Œ¥ŒØ- (di-, 'twice'), œáœÅŒøœåœÇ (khroos, 'color'), and œÉœÑŒ¨œáœÖœÇ (stakhus, 'ear of grain'). The specific name cinerea refers to the greyish hairs of the typical subspecies, from the Latin cinereus ('ashes'). Distribution It is native to Africa, Indian subcontinent and North Australia and introduced to the Caribbean and parts of Southeast Asia. In Ethiopia, the species is common in the Nechisar National Park. The tree was brought to the Caribbean in the 19th century. In Cuba, where it is known as El Marab√∫ or Marabou weed, it has become a serious invasive species problem, occupying about of agricultural land. Plans are underway to exploit it as a source of biomass for renewable power generation. Description and ecology Inflorescence Dichrostachys cinerea is a semi-deciduous to deciduous tree characterized by bark on young branches, dark grey-brown fissures on older branches and stems and smooth on the spines. They typically grow up to in height and have strong alternate thorns, generally up to long. The bipinnately compound leaves are up to long. Flowers of the Dichrostachys cinerea are characteristically in bicoloured cylindrical spikes that resemble Chinese lanterns and are long and fragrant. Upper flowers of a hanging spike are sterile, and are of a lilac or pale purple. Pods are usually a mustard brown and are generally twisted or spiralled and may be up to . The species can be subcategorized with two slight variations that have been recognised: D. cinerea ssp. africana and D. cinerea ssp. nyassana, the latter which is typically larger and less hairy in its foliage. The species tends to grow in rainforest zones that are clearly defined and in altitudes up to . It often occurs in areas with a strong seasonal climate with a wide-ranging mean annual temperature and with a mean annual rainfall ranging from . It occurs in brushwood, thickets, hedges, teak forest and grassland and generally takes to poorer quality clay soils or deep and sandy soils with a wide pH range. In India, it can occur in dry deciduous forest. Dichrostachys cinerea inflorescence (Bhopal, India) In southern Africa, Dichrostachys cinerea generally flowers from October to February with fruiting from May to September. In Indonesia, however, the species has been found flowering from September to June and fruiting from March to May. The tree generally grows at a medium to slow rate, per year. Uses The pods are rich in nutrients Dichrostachys cinerea infructescence, fruit and seeds Dichrostachys cinerea seeds Fruit and seeds that grow on Dichrostachys cinerea are edible. Cattle, camels and game such as giraffe, buffalo, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, red forest duiker and Damara dik-dik feed on the juicy pods that fall to the ground. Such animals also feed on the immature twigs and leaves of the tree which are rich in protein (11‚Äì15%) and minerals. The flowers can be a valuable source of honey. The wood is of a dense nature and burns slowly with no toxicity, so it is often used for fuelwood. The species yields a medium to heavy, durable hardwood and is often used in smaller domestic items as walking sticks, handles, spears and tool handles, particularly in central Africa. In traditional medicine, the bark is used for headache, toothache, dysentery, elephantiasis, root infusions are used for leprosy, syphilis, coughs, as an anthelmintic, purgative and strong diuretic, leaves are used for epilepsy and also as a diuretic and laxative, and a powdered form is massaged on limbs with bone fractures. The roots are also sometimes used for bites or stings. In Siddha medicine of the Tamils in southern India, Dichrostachys cinerea is called vidathther and used for gonorrhea, syphilis and eczema. As they are rich in nutrients, the plants are often used as fertiliser, particularly in the Sahel region of Africa along riverbanks. The plant is widely used for soil conservation, particularly in India, for shallow soils, and in arid western and subhumid alluvial plains. It is also cultivated as an indoor bonsai specimen. Despite its various uses, it is generally regarded a threat to agricultural production and is listed on the Global Invasive Species Database.

It is found in western North America, where its range stretches from Alaska in the north to Baja California in the south and extends east through the Rocky Mountains into Colorado, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming. The butterfly is usually brown or black with extensive white and yellow checkering and some red coloration on the dorsal wing. http://nathistoc.bio.uci.edu/lepidopt/nymph/chalcedo.htm Adult wingspan is . Adult butterflies feed on nectar from flowers while larvae feed on a variety of plants including snowberry (Symphoricarpos), paintbrush (Castilleja), Buddleja, Diplacus aurantiacus and Scrophularia californica. During the breeding period, males congregate around larval host plants to encounter females. Males court female butterflies via physical displays.Rutowski, Ronald L., and George W. Gilchrist. \\"Courtship, Copulation and Oviposition in the Chalcedon Checkerspot,(Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).\\" Journal of Natural History 21.5 (1987): 1109-117. Successful courtship leads to copulation, when the male deposits a nutrient-rich spermatophore in the female. In addition, males also secrete a mating plug during copulation that hinders the ability of females to mate with other males. Pregnant females look for host plants like Diplacus aurantiacus that are close to nectar sources when they lay their eggs. The larvae that emerge from the eggs feed and live on these host plants, some of which have developed strategies to deter larvae from eating their leaves. After moving to a darker and more secluded site, larvae enter diapause, emerging between January and March with pupation usually beginning in April. The variable checkerspot is a food source for many avian predators. Due to a larval diet rich in iridoid compounds such as catalpol, the butterfly has developed a strategy of unpalatability to deter avian predation.Lincoln, David E., and Harold A. Mooney. \\"Herbivory on Diplacus Aurantiacus Shrubs in Sun and Shade.\\" Oecologia 64.2 (1984): 173-76. In addition, coloring plays a part in the defense strategy of the butterfly; intense red coloration deters predators from attacking them. Taxonomy The variable checkerspot is a member of the order Lepidoptera, which contains the butterflies and the moths. It belongs to the family Nymphalidae, which also includes the tortoiseshells and the admirals. The variable checkerspot is part of the genus Euphydryas, which contains other checkerspot butterflies like Euphydryas editha and Euphydryas phaeton. There are ten subspecies of Euphydryas chalcedona. Additional information is required to determine the conservation status of some subspecies. Description The variable checkerspot is usually brown-black with extensive yellow, red and white spots on the dorsal wing. Their underside usually contains yellow and orange bands. However, as its name suggests, the butterfly is highly variable in appearance. Dorsal color can range from a brick-red background with brown and yellow markings in Sierra populations to yellow and black in northern Californian populations. Adult wingspan is . Adult variable checkerspot perching on a leaf Distribution and habitat The variable checkerspot is found across western North America, ranging from Alaska in the north to Baja California and Mexico in the south. Its habitat is bounded to the west by the Pacific Ocean and it extends east past the Rocky Mountains into Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico. The butterfly's habitat encompasses a large variety of environments, including sagebrush flats, desert hills, prairies, open forests and alpine tundra. Life cycle The variable checkerspot lays its eggs in clusters. Pre-diapause larvae often move to fresher parts of the plant in which they are laid to secure a better food source. Before they enter diapause, the larvae leave the food plant to seek better dormancy sites such as under the bark of dead branches, in the hollow stems of dried weeds and in rock crevices. During diapause, some larvae are able to wake up and feed before re-entering dormancy. The larvae emerge from diapause between late January and mid-March. However, in high elevations, larvae can hibernate for several years. Pupation begins in early to middle April and the adult flight season begins between mid-April and May and continues into June. The adult variable checkerspot has a life span of around 15 days.O'Brien, Diane M., Carol L. Boggs, and Marilyn L. Fogel. \\"Making Eggs from Nectar: The Role of Life History and Dietary Carbon Turnover in Butterfly Reproductive Resource Allocation.\\" Oikos 105.2 (2004): 279-91. BreedingMate location= Male mate-location strategies in the variable checkerspot are primarily determined by female distribution in an area. For species like E. chalcedona that pupate densely on larval food plants, females are most densely distributed near these plants. In addition, virgin females, the most desirable mates for male butterflies, are most often found near larval host plants. Male mate-locating behavior has evolved to maximize encounters with virgin females and thus male variable checkerspot butterflies thus primarily use larval food plants as encounter sites for possible female mates. Males both perch near food plants and fly around them in order to look for fertilizable females.Rutowski, Ronald L., George W. Gilchrist, and Barbara Terkanian. \\"Male Mate-locating Behavior in Euphydryas Chalcedona (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) Related to Pupation Site Preferences.\\" Journal of Insect Behavior 1.3 (1988): 277-89.Rutowski, Ronald L. \\"The Evolution of Male Mate-Locating Behavior in Butterflies.\\" The American Naturalist 138.5 (1991): 1121-139. Male butterflies do not stay in one encounter site for long and do not typically defend the territory of their encounter site. Males depend on visual rather than chemical cues to locate females. =Courtship= To start courtship, the male arrives in the vicinity of a fertilizable female, who quickly moves to the ground or to vegetation. The male follows and attempts to copulate with the female by curling his abdomen forward along the side of his body and inserting it between the female's hindwings. At this point, the female may stay still or flutter her wings and move away. If the female moves away, the male follows her and repeats his attempts to copulate. Only when the female stops and remains motionless can the male successfully copulate with her. In unsuccessful courtships, the female either flies away or rapidly flutters her wings until the male departs. Courtship in the variable checkerspot lacks an obvious male display such as the release of chemical signals by the male. Successful courtship in E. chalcedona lasts about a minute. =Copulation= Once a male has successfully courted a female, the pair begins to copulate. Copulations typically last around an hour, although prolonged copulations as long as six hours have been observed in the wild. During copulation, the male fills the female's bursa copulatrix with material that forms the spermatophore, a nutrient-rich complex that delivers the sperm to the female. On average, the spermatophore represents 7% of the male‚Äôs body weight. This weight proportion is similar to that of other butterflies whose mating systems resemble that of the variable checkerspot, indicating that males in these species give roughly similar nutrient investments to their mates.Rutowski, Ronald R., Mark Newton, and John Schaeffer. \\"Interspecific Variation in the Size of the Nutrient Investment Made by Male Butterflies During Copulation.\\" Evolution 37.4 (1983): 708-13. While producing the spermatophore is a costly endeavor for the male, evidence indicates that the spermatophore is not a paternal investment in offspring. In fact, the size of the spermatophore produced by a male is not correlated with the reproductive success of his female mate in terms of the number of eggs she lays and the percentage of those eggs that hatch. Paternal investment via the spermatophore in E. chalcedona may be less important than in other butterfly species due to the severe time constraints on female variable checkerspot butterflies to lay their eggs quickly. Because of these constraints, female butterflies emerge with all oocytes present and some eggs already containing yolk, thus limiting the role of the spermatophore in promoting female reproductive success.Jones, Kristina M., Francois J. Odendaal, and Paul R. Ehrlich. \\"Evidence against the Spermatophore as Paternal Investment in Checkerspot Butterflies (Euphydryas: Nymphalidae).\\" American Midland Naturalist 116.1 (1986): 1-6. =Harassment= Female availability is an important factor in determining mating systems. Because the breeding period of the variable checkerspot is brief, female availability is limited by time as well as by space. Male butterflies in other species with brief female availability have developed strategies that ensure quick access to fertilizable females, leading to high levels of male harassment. This sexual harassment has led mated females in other species of butterfly to gather in areas of lower male density, since consistent harassment could negatively impact the time females have to search for food sources and lay eggs. However, this potential for harassment does not influence egg distribution by mated females in E. chalcedona. Variable checkerspot eggs are always distributed around good larval food sources, regardless of the level of male harassment at those sites.Odendaal, F. J., Y. Iwasa, and P. R. Ehrlich. \\"Duration of Female Availability and Its Effect on Butterfly Mating Systems.\\" The American Naturalist 125.5 (1985): 673-78. =Mating plugs= Female butterflies regularly mate more than once. Females can internally store the sperm of many males at one time, but the sperm of the most recently mated male is the one that usually fertilizes the female. While seeking out multiple mates can lead to increased parasite exposure and predation risk, female butterflies can often benefit from remating by receiving more material resources from males and increasing the genetic diversity of their offspring. Virgin females are found to engage in remating behavior more frequently than recently mated females. Remating behavior by a female harms her most previous mate, who could lose his paternity if another male's sperm fertilizes the female. Thus, after males produce the spermatophore, they pass an additional gland secretion that spills out of the female's copulatory opening, forming a mating plug that hardens within a few hours of copulation. As the female variable checkerspot has two genital openings, this secretion does not impact oviposition ability. The mating plug protects the male's paternity by acting as a mechanical barrier to reinsemination by preventing other males from penetrating the female.Dickinson, Janis L., and Ronald L. Rutowski. \\"The Function of the Mating Plug in the Chalcedon Checkerspot Butterfly.\\" Animal Behaviour 38.1 (1989): 154-62. Group behavior During the flight season, large groups of variable checkerspot butterflies can be found across western North America. Individual butterflies are capable of recognizing suitable areas rich in larval food plants and do not usually linger in other parts of the landscape. This leads to populations of butterflies that are small, isolated and clearly separated from other populations.Ehrlich, P. R., D. D. Murphy, M. C. Singer, C. B. Sherwood, R. R. White, and I. L. Brown. \\"Extinction, Reduction, Stability and Increase: The Responses of Checkerspot Butterfly (Euphydryas) Populations to the California Drought.\\" Oecologia 46.1 (1980): 101-05. Females do not fly as much as males, who frequently fly around their habitats and perch in open areas while searching for female mates.Brown, Irene L., and Paul R. Ehrlich. \\"Population Biology of the Checkerspot Butterfly, Euphydryas Chalcedona Structure of the Jasper Ridge Colony.\\" Oecologia 47.2 (1980): 239-51. Flight times for the variable checkerspot vary regionally. Usually, the flight season lasts from April to June in California and Oregon, while it normally takes place from June to July further north and in higher elevations. Diet The diet of the variable checkerspot changes dramatically with development: the larva has an herbivorous diet consisting entirely of plants while the adult butterfly feeds exclusively on nectar. =Larval diet= The principal food source for variable checkerspot larvae are the leaves of the flowering subshrub Diplacus aurantiacus that also usually serve as its host plant. D. aurantiacus contains large amounts of a leaf phenolic resin, which helps resist water loss during drought. Laboratory and field studies have shown that increased resin content is negatively correlated to the growth and survivorship of variable checkerspot larvae, indicating that the phenolic resin in D. aurantiacus plays in important role in deterring larvae from feeding on leaves.Han, Kaiping, and David Lincoln. \\"The Evolution of Carbon Allocation to Plant Secondary Metabolites: A Genetic Analysis of Cost in Diplacus Aurantiacus.\\" Evolution 48.5 (1994): 1550-563. Another factor in D. aurantiacus plants that impacts larval growth is leaf nitrogen content. Unlike resin levels, heightened nitrogen levels are correlated with increased larval growth and survivorship. In a controlled experiment, larva that were fed a diet of fertilized D. aurantiacus plants, which contained 50% more nitrogen than unfertilized plants, experienced higher survival rates and growth than larvae that fed on unfertilized plants.Johnson, Nelson D., Kathy S. Williams, and Paul R. Ehrlich. \\"Effects of Chemical Fertilization of Diplacus Aurantiacus on the Development and Persistence of the Postdiapause Larvae of Its Lepidopteran Herbivore Euphydryas Chalcedona.\\" American Midland Naturalist 117.2 (1987): 435-38. While leaves with increased nitrogen content are the most attractive for the larvae, they are also the most valuable carbon-gainers for the plant. This leads to the activity patterns of larvae and D. aurantiacus plants synchronizing. Larvae emerge from diapause as D. aurantiacus plants start flowering. This is when the plants need the most carbon. The plants then concentrate their resin in their youngest leaves, which contain the largest amount of nitrogen; this resin deterrent forces larvae to feed on less valuable older leaves whose nitrogen content is lower.Mooney, H. A., K. S. Williams, D. E. Lincoln, and P. R. Ehrlich. \\"Temporal and Spatial Variability in the Interaction between the Checkerspot Butterfly, Euphydryas Chalcedona and Its Principal Food Source, the Californian Shrub, Diplacus Aurantiacus.\\" Oecologia 50.2 (1981): 195-98. To maximize their own nutritional benefits, larvae selectively eat leaves with the highest available nitrogen:resin ratio.Williams, K. S., D. E. Lincoln, and P. R. Ehrlich. \\"The Coevolution of Euphydryas Chalcedona Butterflies and Their Larval Host Plants I. Larval Feeding Behavior and Host Plant Chemistry.\\" Oecologia 56.2-3 (1983): 323-29. In addition, larvae exhibit a strong preference for feeding on host plant leaves that have been in the sun compared to leaves that have been in the shade. Another less common host plant for variable checkerspot larvae is Scrophularia californica, which lacks the resin defense system found in D. aurantiacus and is thus easier for larvae to digest. Larvae that feed on S. californica grow faster and larger than those that feed on D. aurantiacus. While D. aurantiacus may not be the most nutritious food for the larvae, it is the most reliable and widespread host available to the variable checkerspot and is often the plant closest to nectar sources, leading to its role as principal host plant and food source for the larvae.Williams, K. S., D. E. Lincoln, and P. R. Ehrlich. \\"The Coevolution of Euphydryas Chalcedona Butterflies and Their Larval Host Plants II. Maternal and Host Plant Effects on Larval Growth, Development, and Food-Use Efficiency.\\" Oecologia 56.2-3 (1983): 330-35. =Adult diet= Adult butterfly obtaining nectar In contrast to the herbivorous diet of the larva, the adult variable checkerspot's main food source is the nectar it obtains from flowers. In Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in California, an extremely well studied site, the nectar source most frequently used by adult butterflies is Eriodictyon californicum. =Diet and oviposition= The diet of the adult butterfly has a large impact on the choice of D. aurantiacus as the oviposition site and larval host of the variable checkerspot. Adult butterflies prefer to oviposit on host sites that are close to nectar sources. In the Jasper Ridge site, D. aurantiacus is the host plant closest to the E. californicum nectar source. This proximity advantage overcomes its nutritional deficiencies compared to other host plants and leads to it being the principle host plant of variable checkerspot butterflies.Murphy, Dennis D., Marian S. Menninger, and Paul R. Ehrlich. \\"Nectar Source Distribution as a Determinant of Oviposition Host Species in Euphydryas Chalcedona.\\" Oecologia 62.2 (1984): 269-71. Adult variable checkerspot Predation and defense The variable checkerspot's main predators are birds. Populations of the variable checkerspot, like most lepidopterans, are usually scarcely distributed and thus direct observation of avian predation on butterflies is rare. One study analyzed the evidence of avian predation on the butterflies by the presence of a large number of detached variable checkerspot wings at a butterfly population center. These detached wings exhibited beak marks and characteristic triangular tears indicating that birds attacked the butterflies and detached their wings before eating the body. In addition to the remains of this successful predation, photographs of variable checkerspot butterflies show some individuals that exhibit beak marks and tears, indicating unsuccessful avian predation attempts. Analysis of the avian predation on the variable checkerspot population has found that predators disproportionately attack female butterflies. This is because attacks are concentrated on butterflies that contain less intense red coloration. The male butterfly exhibits more variation in its coloration than the female, and can be more intensely red colored. This means that on average, females face more attacks than males do. Red serves as a warning color in many species of butterfly, so it is possible that diminished avian predation is linked to this warning signal. Indeed, the pressure exerted on the variable checkerspot by visually hunting avian predators may play an important role in the evolution of its wing coloration and pattern.Bowers, M. D., Irene L. Brown, and Darryl Wheye. \\"Bird Predation as a Selective Agent in a Butterfly Population.\\" Evolution 39.1 (1985): 93-103. =Defense strategy= The variable checkerspot, like many other butterflies, has developed a defense strategy of unpalatability to birds as a means of resisting predation. In a controlled experiment, would-be avian predators often exhibit head-shaking and beak-wiping behavior after killing a variable checkerspot, characteristic of tasting unpalatable prey. The unpleasant taste of the butterfly is likely due to the presence of irisoid glycoside compounds in the scrophulariaceous plants that make up the majority of its larval diet.Bowers, M. D. \\"Unpalatability as a Defense Strategy of Western Checkerspot Butterflies (Euphydryas Scudder, Nymphalidae).\\" Evolution 35.2 (1981): 367-75. Iridoid glycosides The main iridoid glycoside found in the diet of variable checkerspot butterflies is catalpol. Chemical analysis has shown that the only iridoid glycoside present in adult butterflies is catalpol.Stermitz, Frank R., Maged S. Abdel-Kader, Tommaso A. Foderaro, and Marc Pomeroy. \\"Iridoid Glycosides from Some Butterflies and Their Larval Food Plants.\\" Phytochemistry 37.4 (1994): 997-99. Because they are essential for the larvae to develop an unpalatable taste to birds, iridoids act as larval feeding stimulants. Given a choice between a diet that contains no additives and one that contains iridoid glycoside compounds, larvae exhibit a preference for the diet containing the extra iridoid compounds, using olfactory cues to sense their presence. The primary host plants of the variable checkerspot are all rich in catalpol compounds, and the presence of these compounds plays a fundamental role in determining choice of host plant when females oviposit.Bowers, M. Deane. \\"The Role of Iridoid Glycosides in Host-plant Specificity of Checkerspot Butterflies.\\" Journal of Chemical Ecology 9.4 (1983): 475-93. This suggests that the variable checkerspot has evolved to use iridoid compounds as female oviposition stimulants as well as larval feeding stimulants.

His father and his brother Colm√°n R√≠mid are both uncertainly reckoned High Kings of Ireland. . Aldfrith of Northumbria and the Irish genealogies. Ireland, C. A., in Celtica 22 (1991]. Two reports The Irish annals have two reports of M√°el Umai. The first, in the Annals of Tigernach states that he fought alongside √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in of D√°l Riata at the Battle of Degsastan where √Åed√°n was defeated by the Northumbrian ruler √Üthelfrith.Byrne, p. 111; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, p. 216; Mac Niocall, p. 79, has M√°el Umai killed at Degsastan. According to the annals, M√°el Umai killed √Üthelfrith's brother, who is incorrectly called Eanfrith.Annals of Tigernach, AT 598.2; Mac Cana, p. 35. Bede confirms the death of √Üthelfrith's brother at Degsastan, giving his name as Theodbald, and adding that he was killed along with all of his retinue.HE I, 34 Bede dates the battle to 603 and the Annals of Tigernach to 598. The second report of M√°el Umai is the notice of his death, probably in 608.The chronology of the Irish annals in this period is unreliable. The Annals of Tigernach date his death to 608 and the Annals of Ulster probably to 610. Dan McCarthy of Trinity College Dublin has proposed the abandonment of the traditional reliance on the chronology of the Annals of Ulster in this period, see his writings for a full discussion. Irish tales A list of early Irish tales includes the now-lost Echtra M√°el Uma meic B√°et√°in (Adventures of M√°el Umai mac B√°et√°in). Proinsias Mac Cana notes that the compiler of this list included this tale alongside another, also seemingly lost, concerning √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in, and a third dealing with the equally historical Mong√°n mac Fiachnai, concerning whom several unhistorical tales survive. He suggests that the subject of the tale may have been the battle of Degsastan. All three were involved in events in northern Britain in the years around 600 AD. Tales of M√°el Umai were also known in medieval Wales, for he appears among a list of otherwise legendary Irish heroes taken from the tales of the Ulster Cycle which is included in Culhwch and Olwen.Mac Cana, pp. 34-36. Surviving genealogies refer to M√°el Umai as \\"the fierce\\" and as a \\"war leader\\", leading Mac Cana to propose that he was remembered as a heroic warrior, similar to the legendary figures of the Ulster Cycle.Mac Cana, pp. 35-36.

It was founded between 899 and 902 by Alfred the Great's widow Ealhswith, who was described as the 'builder' of the Nunnaminster in the New Minster Liber Vitae. The first buildings were completed by their son, Edward the Elder. Among the house's early members was Edward's daughter Edburga. Sometime after 963 Bishop √Üthelwold re-founded the monastery and re-endowed it, imposing the stricter Benedictine rule. According to √Üthelwold's hagiographer, Wulfstan the Cantor, √Üthelwold made a woman called √Üthelthryth abbess of the Nunnaminster. √Üthelwold may also have translated the relics of Edburga, now recognized as a saint, to a more prominent shrine within the Nunnaminster; however, this event is only attested in Osbert of Clare's much later Vita S. Edburgae. The house stood between High Street and Colebroke Street and was known as Nunnaminster. According to the Domesday Book the abbess held Lyss, Froyle, Leckford Abbess, Long Stoke, Timsbury, and Ovington in Hampshire; Coleshill in Berkshire; and Urchfont and All Cannings in Wiltshire. The Nunnery was rebuilt again after the Norman conquest, perhaps by AD 1100, by which time it was known as St Mary's Abbey.\\"The Nunnaminster in Winchester\\", City of Winchester During The Anarchy the monastery was burnt in the great fire of Winchester in 1141. The house became impoverished during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but thanks to various grants and concessions it recovered its position and was in a healthy state at the time of the suppression. The house was suppressed as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in November 1539, with pensions granted to the abbess, prioress and nuns. Considerable remains of the buildings survived into the seventeenth century, but only certain watercourses survive into the present.

Powertrains  The XE- series was introduced with a choice of five engines. * 3.3-litre inline six- cylinder * 4.1-litre inline six-cylinder * 4.1-litre inline electronic fuel injected six-cylinder * 4.9-litre V8 * 5.8-litre V8 Ford Australia built a quantity of 4-bolt 5.8 litre engines ‚Äî similar to those used in NASCAR at the time ‚Äî for race purposes in Australia. When the engine's local racing career ended at the end of 1984, the surplus stock was shipped and sold in the United States for use in DeTomaso Panteras as Detroit did not offer the 351 Cleveland engine anymore. The last Australian manufactured Cleveland V8-powered Ford Falcon passenger car was a silver Ford Fairmont (XE) Ghia ESP sedan, VIN # JG32AR33633K, in November 1982 (although Ford promoted this car as the \\"Last V8\\" there were a number of V8 XE Falcons produced after this build number). A fuel-injected ‚ÄúEFI‚Äù version of the six-cylinder was introduced in February 1983 to, in effect, replace the V8s, but initially produced only and of torque, well down from the and previously produced by the defunct V8. Manual transmission was available in 3-speed column shift and in the more common 4-speed floor shift. Automatic transmission was 3-speed, floor shift in 5-seater configurations and column shift in 6-seater units. Automatic was more common than manual, even though it was at extra cost in the GL and lesser range of vehicles. The XE was the first Falcon to be offered with a 5-speed manual transmission, but only when packaged with the base 3.3 litre engine.  Model range  The XE range consisted of nine models marketed as follows: * Falcon utilityAC Bushby, The Australian Ford Falcon, 1989, pages 200‚Äì201 * Falcon van * Falcon GL ute * Falcon GL van * Falcon GL sedanThe ‚ÄòLast‚Äô V8 Retrieved from www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk on 16 October 2009 * Falcon GL wagon * Fairmont sedan * Fairmont wagon * Fairmont Ghia sedan A new version of Ford's S-Pack option was available for Falcon GL sedan, wagon, ute and van (all then badged as Falcon S) whilst a new version of the European Sports Pack (ESP) option also remained on offer for the Fairmont Ghia sedan.

Examples of ESP upgrades are, two-tone Charcoal-accented paint or base Ghia paint, Scheel-brand front bucket seats or Ghia Seats, Cleveland V8 or EFI Crossflow, 3 speed C4 auto or 4 speed single rail manual. Most ESP optioned Ghias are easily distinguishable from the Fairmont Ghia, however, many Option 54 Fairmont Ghias look so similar to the Fairmont Ghia that most owners of a used example do not realise they have an ESP as there is no code on the compliance plate to distinguish this. The only way to ascertain if a Fairmont Ghia is a genuine ESP is to contact Ford Australia with the compliance details and have the vehicles original purchase order examined for \\"option 54\\". The only common components of an XE ESP were the differential and rear brakes, \\"Option 54\\" included LSD and rear disc brakes as standard. All 1982 built XE ESP 's were two toned with front/rear/side orange body moulds with Scheel Seats optioned in two colours one in Gun Metal Grey and the second in Sierra Tan in Colour with gold snowflake wheels. Build numbers on 1982 V8 XE ESPs total to 538 build as there is no numbers on the 6 cylinder XE ESP's numbers estimate at 200 or less. 351 ‚Äì 178 (Manual optioned only) 302 ‚Äì 100 (Manual) 302 ‚Äì 260 (Auto) Total ‚Äì 538 Build V8 XE. ESP's Although the car was named European Sports Pack (ESP) as Ford had dropped the GT brand due to insurance purposes the XE ESP V8 Falcons were essentially an '80s model GT Falcon. With the Cleveland being dropped in 1982 Ford continued the production in the 1983/1984 XE ESP with a single-toned coloured car with a 6-cylinder EFI motor which exterior paint of car looked same to the XE Ghia but the Scheel, a Gunmetal interior, remained in the XE ESP along with its gold Snowflake wheels. These were and are a true muscle car of the '80s which are very desirable and rare to find today. =XE Phase 6= Falcon Phase 6 Wayne Draper, designer of the XD and XE Falcons at Ford, was also the designer of the aftermarket based Phase 5 XD Falcon using his HO Phase Autos business in the early eighties. When Ford abandoned HO, Draper bought the rights to the HO name. HO Phase Autos were the original manufacturers of the aerodynamic kits for the Group C racing Falcons. The Series 1 XE Phase 6 was altered for racing, like the Phase 5 XD, to comply with CAMS regulations. Ford had to remove the original wing and replaced it with the DJR racing rear air dam that created more drag to fit regulations. The Series 2 XE Phase 6 is cosmetically updated with mirrors and door trims from the later XF Falcon.  Market and reception  The XE Falcon / ZK Fairlane / FD LTD range of cars combined to become the first automobiles to receive a prestigious Australian Design Award. As the fuel crisis eased, Australians moved away from the smaller Holden Commodore back to the traditional full-size Falcon. In 1982, for the first time in more than a decade, the Falcon eclipsed its Holden rival in terms of annual sales, and remained Australia's number one selling car until 1988. Production totalled 193,890 units prior to the replacement of the XE by the XF Falcon in October 1984.Falcon XF Technical Specifications Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 16 October 2009  Motorsport  Dick Johnson won the 1984 Australian Touring Car Championship behind the wheel of a Group C specification XE Falcon sedan, commonly known as \\"Greens Tuf\\" (due to the cars green paint and the name of one of the steel products from the main sponsor ‚Äì Palmer Tube Mills). This final evolution of Greens Tuf was rated at and was retired at the end of 1984 when the Group C-era ended. It is now part of the David Bowden collection.

His family name was Capponi; he was called a Porrecta from his place of birth. He is best known as a commentator on the Summa of Thomas Aquinas; he also wrote commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testaments. Life He joined the Dominican Order at Bologna in 1552. His life was devoted entirely to study, teaching, writing, and preaching. He taught philosophy, theology (dogmatic and moral), and Sacred Scripture. In 1606, Father Capponi was invited to teach theology and Sacred Scripture to the Carthusians in a monastery near Bologna. He accepted the invitation, but two years later he was recalled to Bologna, where he died. Michele Pio, who wrote his life, states that on the last day of his life Porrecta completed his explanation on the last verse of the Psalms. The people of Bologna venerated him as a saint; miracles are said to have been wrought through his intercession and his body was taken (1615) from the community burying-ground to be deposited in the Dominican church. Works Until the Leonine edition of Thomas Aquinas's works appeared, the Porrecta-Cajetan commentaries were classical.

Both Krauss and Maffei supplied three prototypes each and both were later involved in the production batches. Eight locomotives of the same type were supplied by Krauss in 1900 to the Lokalbahn AG (Lokalbahn Aktien- Gesellschaft or LAG), which later sold them to the Bavarian state railway, where they were given the numbers 2507 to 2512. A further three locomotives were supplied by Krauss to the South German Electric Branch Lines (AG S√ºddeutsche elektrische Lokalbahnen) that was taken over in 1904 by the LAG; again these locomotives were sold to the state railway.

Egypt is located on Pennsylvania Route 329, just west of its intersection with Pennsylvania Route 145 at Eagle Point. The population of Egypt is 2,391 as of the 2010 census.http://www.city- data.com/neighborhood/Egypt-Whitehall-PA.html History Built in 1756, the Troxell-Steckel House is one of the oldest buildings in Lehigh County. Located near Egypt, Fort Deshler (seen here in an 1895 engraving) was built in 1760 to protect settlers from Indian attacks during the French and Indian War. Egypt is one of the oldest communities in eastern Pennsylvania, having been settled as early as 1733. It was the first settlement in Pennsylvania north of South Mountain. Page 19 Early Pennsylvania German settlers of nearby present-day Lynn and Albany townships had named the area where they settled Alle m√§ngel (\\"all deficiencies\\") due to the poor quality of the soil on which they were trying to farm and raise crops. By contrast, the soil here was found to be quite fertile, and early settlers named this region \\"Egypta,\\" since ancient Egypt, with its fertile Nile delta, was the \\"granary of the world.\\"Page 304 The Reformed Congregation of Egypt Church was established in 1734, and a log church was erected in 1764. The cemetery of the Egypt church contains the graves of many of the region's earliest inhabitants, including 25 veterans of the American Revolutionary War, 15 veterans of the War of 1812, and nine veterans of the American Civil War.Gensey, Page 139. Across the street from the church stands Egypt's World War I monument, which honors the 76 men from Egypt who served during that war. Dedicated on June 10, 1923, the centerpiece of the monument is the pressed copper sculpture, Spirit of the American Doughboy, by E. M. Viquesney. One of the first settlers, John Jacob Mickley (1697‚Äì1769), started farming here in 1745. In 1755, Jacob Kohler established a gristmill, located along the Coplay Creek just south of the church. The Troxell-Steckel House, which was built in Egypt in 1756, is one of the oldest buildings in Lehigh CountyRoberts, History of Lehigh County, Page 1016. and is today operated as a museum and historic site by the Lehigh County Historical Society. The Egypt area was also the location of Fort Deshler, a French and Indian War era frontier fort established in 1760 to protect settlers from Indian attacks.Roberts, History of Lehigh County, Page 111. The fort, which was near the present intersection of PA Route 145 and Chestnut Street, stood until about 1940. The site is commemorated by a Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission marker. A granite marker, located just outside Egypt at Scheidy's Road and Spring Street, commemorates the last Indian attack in Lehigh County, which occurred on October 8, 1763, when nine settlers were murdered.Roberts, History of Lehigh County, Pages 104-107. The earliest hotel in the area was the Werley House, which operated from 1796 to 1815.Roberts, History of Lehigh County, Page 1015. The first \\"English school\\" (as opposed to one that taught students in the Pennsylvania German dialect) was organized in 1808. Other early industries in the immediate area included a carriage works, coal yard, bakery, tannery and silk works. Development of the community was spurred by the organization of the American Improved Cements Company (later American Cement Company), which took over and modernized the older Egypt Mills cement plant, located on the north side of Chestnut Street. In 1884, the company shipped its first load of cement to market using the Ironton Railroad. In 1896, American Cement ran power lines to supply the village of Egypt with electricity from its own power plants.Gensey, Page 105. American Cement, which subsequently opened a number of mills in the Egypt area, operated until 1913, when it was purchased by Giant Portland Cement.Gensey, Page 106. In addition to the Egypt Mills plant, Giant Portland operated six other cement mills in Egypt (Pennsylvania, Columbia, Giant #1 & #2, Central and Reliance), and had an annual production capacity of 2.1 million barrels of cement. Parts of the New York City Subway was built using cement manufactured in Egypt's mills. Giant Portland ceased production around 1929, and mills were either closed or sold to other companies operating in the area. Today, cement production remains an important part of the local economy, and plants in the area are operated by Nazareth-based ESSROC a subsidiary of the Italian firm Italcementi, and the French company Lafarge.

Having immigrated from Latvia, the Immerman brothers operated a Harlem delicatessen and made their fortune as bootleggers. Their club was located at 2221 Seventh Avenue at 131st Street in a basement from 1923 until 1934. Acts featured there included Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, Wilbur Sweatman, Peg Leg Bates, Bricktop and Fletcher Henderson. Unlike the Cotton Club, Connie's Inn featured African- American performers but did not restrict its audience to whites only. Its steep cover charge of $2.50, its intimate atmosphere, and its ability to hire famous entertainers made the club unique among other New York clubs. Members of the Ziegfeld Follies, heiress Gertrude Vanderbilt, and numerous others poured in from downtown to enjoy the shows at Connie's Inn and were sometimes influential in moving their revues to Broadway. Connie Immerman was instrumental in the design and the promotion of the revues, including the famous Hot Chocolates revue. Leonard Harper became the Connie's Inn in-house producer during its glory days. In the early 1930s, the Immermans moved Connie's Inn to a downtown location. There, they produced one of their last great revues, Stars Over Broadway, which starred Billie Holiday and featured Bessie Smith as a temporary fill-in for Holiday when she was ill. The Great Depression forced Connie's Inn to close and the Immerman brothers to obtain individual employment. In April 1934 the Harlem site re-opened as the Club Ubangi and featured famous lesbian, gay and bisexual entertainers such as Gladys Bentley and comedian Jackie Mabley, later known as Moms Mabley References * Allen, Irving L.

It is a small brick European-style building erected in the late 1920s. It was built by the area's small community of Russian Jewish emigrants. Over the years, its membership has dwindled and it has moved from its original Orthodox affiliation to Conservative, and eventually to Reform practices. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, the only synagogue in New York east of the Hudson River and north of New York City to be listed. Building The synagogue is on a lot on the south side of East Main, about a quarter-mile (250 m) east of the intersection of highways NY 22, US 44 and NY 343 at the center of the hamlet. There are houses across the street from various eras of Amenia's existence. To the west of the synagogue is a woodlot; to the east is a 19th-century house. Rows of planted evergreen trees set off the synagogue lot lines on east and west and a small concrete sidewalk leads to the front steps from the main sidewalk along East Main. =Exterior= The building is a tall one-story building on a parged concrete foundation sided in hollow tile over which a brick veneer in common bond has been pasted and cast stone trim applied. Brick pilasters mark the corners of the north (front) facade and the three-bay side elevations. On top is a gabled roof, pierced by a narrow brick chimney at the southwest, with the ends clad in asbestos shingles. It has a frame rear wing oriented perpendicularly to the main block. Three concrete steps with flagstone insets, partially covered by a wooden wheelchair ramp, lead to the front entrance. It consists of double wooden doors with a cast stone surround surmounted by a glass panel above the doors with \\"CONGREGATION BETH DAVID\\" reverse painted in gold letters on a black background. It is flanked by two sconces and tall, narrow round arched windows with a header course of bricks and cast stone lintels. Above the door is a wider round-arched double window with a blind transom and brick arch surround. Cast stone impost blocks engage a horizontal stringer course of brick in a basket-weave pattern that also engages the similar cast stone capitals on the pilasters. A gold-colored Star of David is in the gable field. Both east and west profiles have similar long, narrow windows in their bays, divided by pilasters topped with a plain frieze that becomes wider with each pilaster south. Both also have a fourth bay at the south end with a different treatment. On the west it has been divided by a spandrel; on the east it is a small window that lights only the lower space. Two small windows on the upper story complete the fenestration of the main block. The older one-story frame rear wing with shed roof and brick chimney connects with the newer addition, a gable-roofed section wider than the main block on a concrete foundation sided in asbestos shingles. It has an entrance and porch in its east end. =Interior= The main entrance opens on a small vestibule with a staircase to the upstairs gallery on the west and a bathroom on the east. Another pair of doors leads into the sanctuary, a square space with high ceiling floored in carpeted fir with plaster walls and ceiling in a two-tone color scheme. It has a traditional Orthodox layout, with a centrally located bimah surrounded on three sides by theatre-style pews with individually upholstered fold-down seats. The pews and bimah are dark stained pine. All face a Torah ark projecting from the rear wall, painted with murals of candlesticks and scrolls. Atop the ark are a pair of gilt Lions of Judah holding a scroll with a hanging lighted crown above. Two stairs with electric lights on the upper newel post lead up to the bimah. Above it is the central chandelier. Sconces along the sides alternate with the windows, whose lower sashes have stained glass with geometric designs and Jewish symbols. Bookcases and commemorative plaques are located beneath the balcony. Another bathroom is located to the east of the balcony, which has a high solid rail. Behind the sanctuary, but not directly accessible from it, is an area with a kitchen on the first floor and the rabbi's study on the second. The smaller wing section has bathrooms and a storage room, with the larger addition given over entirely to a classroom with pasteboard walls and simple woodwork. The flooring is carpeted fir. Walls and ceilings are plaster in a two-tone color scheme. History Beth David was founded by a group of 12 to 15 Russian Jewish families that had settled in Amenia. Many had come there from nearby Ellsworth, Connecticut, in the eastern part of the town of Sharon, where they farmed and rented rooms to visitors from the city in summertime. By the 1920s, many had moved across the state line, as Amenia had better schools and electricity, as well as convenient rail access to New York City via the New York Central Railroad's Harlem Valley line. Several families went into the resort business full-time, opening their own hotels around nearby Lake Amenia. It was a small Jewish community compared to those that had sprung up in the Catskills, on the other side of the Hudson Valley. Members at first worshiped in their homes, raising the money over several years to build their own synagogue. A small plot of land was donated, and the cornerstone lain on April 5, 1929, at a ceremony attended by members of the local Christian community as well. All present donated to the construction of the synagogue, raising a total of $240 ($ in contemporary dollars) . The synagogue, open later that year, was originally a flat-roofed structure with low parapets similar to those in Eastern Europe. Its interior plan, with centrally located bimah and upstairs gallery for women, reflects that region's Orthodox traditions, in keeping with origins of the founding families. The exterior brickwork shows some Georgian influence. For the next two decades, the synagogue prospered along with Amenia's Jews. After World War II, in the 1950s, changes in vacationing habits led to the summer resorts closing down. Flooding after Hurricane Diane in 1955 destroyed the dam and drained Lake Amenia (now Beekman Park), ending that industry in the area. Children of the founding families left the area, taking the second generation with them. In 1960 the gabled roof was installed. By 1970 the synagogue was down to 12 members. To sustain itself in the following decades, it became first Conservative, then Reform. Despite fluctuations in membership, in 2004 the congregation celebrated the synagogue's 75th anniversary. In 2016, Beth David is a vibrant Reform Congregation, drawing its growing membership from both permanent residents and weekenders in Dutchess and Litchfield Counties.

His first position was as a curate in BirminghamThe Times, 1 October 1888, p. 7, \\"Ordinations: Diocese of Worcester\\" at St Alban's, Bordesley. This was followed by a curacy at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. He then emigrated to Australia where he became rector of Christ Church St Laurence in 1895. Trower's appointment to Christ Church caused controversy in the predominantly evangelical Diocese of Sydney as it was made without reference to the diocesan nominators after the parochial nominators had consulted Fr R. L. Page, superior of the Cowley Fathers in Oxford. During his short term as rector, a Sung Eucharist became the rule for Sundays and the parish acquired several sets of vestments. The church became open all day for private prayer, while more free pews (not rented) were set aside for the poor.Laura Mary Allen, A History of Christ Church S Laurence, Sydney (Finn Bros, Sydney, 1939) p 67-76. Trower had a whimsical sense of humour which he often displayed at public gatherings. During one synod debate on church ritual he pointed out that candles, when used to beautify a church, were no different to vegetables decorating a harvest festival, adding \\"so, if you blow out our lights, we'll blow out your flowers and vegetables\\". While on a visit to England, in 1900, he resigned to take up an appointment as Bishop of Likoma in northern Malawi. His former parishioners at Christ Church St Laurence gave him a gold pectoral cross,ADB online: Trower, G. and he received the honorary degree Doctor of Divinity (DD) from the University of Oxford. He was consecrated as Bishop of Likoma by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, in Westminster Abbey, on 25 January 1902, and arrived in his diocese later that year. The bishopric of Likoma in Nyasaland (now Malawi) was part of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa, started at the suggestion of David Livingstone. Trower laid the foundations of a cathedral (dedicated in the name of St Peter) on the island of Likoma in Lake Nyasa in January 1903 and he dedicated the building for worship in 1905. He also founded the theological college at Nkwazi in 1905.George Herbert Wilson, The History of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (1936), p 124 - 133. In 1908, he secured from the Archbishop of Canterbury a change in his See's name from Likoma back to Nyasaland. Trower left Likoma in 1910 to take up the oversight of the new Diocese of North West Australia on the insistence of an old friend, Charles Riley, the Bishop of Perth. In September 1925, he ordained James Noble, the first Australian Aboriginal person to be made a deacon of the Anglican Church. After 17 years in North West Australia, Trower retired to Chale, Isle of Wight, where he died in 1928.Isle of Wight County Press, 31 August 1928.

The film is based on the 2002 Tamil film Pammal K. Sambandam, and features Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor in pivotal roles along with actors Aftab Shivdasani and Amrita Arora in supporting roles. Hollywood actors Sylvester Stallone, Denise Richards, Brandon Routh and Holly Valance appear in cameos, playing themselves. Originally scheduled to release in December 2008, the film was postponed due to extensive production work and was released on 3 July 2009. Kambakkht Ishq was commercially successful at the box office. It was termed Hit by Box Office India.  Plot  When Hollywood stuntman Viraj Shergill (Akshay Kumar) and medical student Simrita Rai (Kareena Kapoor) come across each other at his brother Lucky's (Aftab Shivdasani) and her best friend Kamini Sandhu's (Amrita Arora) hastily planned wedding ceremony, they instantly develop a dislike for each other. Both have a very low opinion of the opposite sex, and staunchly believe marriage is not the way to go for the two newlyweds, whom they try to discourage from proceeding further. Simrita convinces Kamini to test out her theory that men are after only one thing, by forcing Lucky to delay their marriage vows for three months. She is sure, Lucky will not be able to do so and this will prove to Kamini that Lucky was just another low-class male, like all others, and her claims of him being different from most men are unfounded. Viraj, upon hearing about this new development, tries to do the exact opposite. This results in a hilarious scene at a local disco bar, where Viraj lures Kamini with the hope of her finding Lucky with a \\"girlfriend\\" that he has planted in the lap of Lucky in order to make Kamini jealous. The plan backfires out of a police raid and Kamini and Lucky end up in divorce court where the judge puts them on a three-month probation and marriage counselling. Simrita keeps on telling Kamini that all men are the same and that all they want is sex. Lucky tries to make love with Kamini but she never lets him come near her. Meanwhile, Simrita and Viraj keep bumping into each other when they both travel to Italy independently; the former to make some quick cash as a model to pay her medical bills, and the latter, with Lucky, to chill out and take a vacation from all of the marital stress Lucky has been facing back home. Upon returning home, Simrita is given a watch pendant by her aunt Dolly (Kirron Kher) to wear as a good luck charm. The pendant hangs from a bracelet on her wrist. Viraj gets seriously hurt in an accident at work and is brought for emergency surgery to the hospital where Simrita is an intern. Much to each other's irritation, Simrita is given the charge to perform surgery on Viraj. After the surgery, while looking at the X-rays, she is horrified to discover that the watch on her wrist has accidentally ended up in Viraj's stomach. Simrita tries various ways of getting the watch out. During one such process, which fails, it becomes clear that Simrita is bitter about her perceived unfaithfulness of the two most prominent men from her childhood: her divorced father and her elder sister's ex-husband. By this time, Viraj is secretly beginning to fall in love with Simrita. Several days later, Simrita is successful in removing the watch from Viraj's stomach. Following the surgery, Viraj overhears the truth and leaves. Several days later, he proposes to Denise Richards in an attempt to forget about Simrita. Upon realising her mistake, Simrita helps Lucky and Kamini reconcile and decides to confess her love for Viraj at the wedding ceremony. At first, Denise is upset but then tells Viraj to go to Simrita. The two embrace and go off together in the car sharing a few passionate kisses.

Later that month Kareena Kapoor was signed on to play the female lead. It is the seventh time Kumar and Kapoor are paired on-screen. Kumar plays a Hollywood stuntman in the film and Kapoor plays a high-society girl. According to Nadiadwala, \\"It will be an international love story on a lavish scale.\\" The project was originally expected to commence filming in January 2008 in Los Angeles with nine actors from Hollywood but due to extensive pre-production work on the film, it was later shifted to May 2008. Reports indicated that actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger was signed on to do a cameo and that the film would feature a performance by singer and actress Beyonc√© Knowles. Prashant Shah, line producer of Kambakkht Ishq in L.A. commented, \\"We are in talks with Beyonc√© and we have also received a letter from Arnold's office...Things will be confirmed shortly and we will be making a formal announcement when that happens.\\" It was later reported that neither star would be appearing in the film. In March 2008, Nadiadwala announced that \\"this would be the first Indian film to be shot within Universal Studios.\\" However, when a fire broke out on the backlot of Universal Studios on 1 June 2008, the shooting of the film was expected to be delayed. But the producer indicated, \\"so far the area where we are supposed to shoot remains unaffected. So for now, we are proceeding on schedule.\\" Later that month, the cast finally began filming for the project in Los Angeles, California, where pivotal scenes were shot at the Kodak Theatre and Universal Studios. In August 2008, reports had indicated that the film was 50‚Äì60% complete and the cast would continue filming for the project in Venice, Italy. After completing their overseas schedule, the production team later headed to shoot in Mumbai, India. During December 2008, reports surfaced indicating that Kumar and Kapoor would appear alongside Carmen Electra in a promotional music video for the film. In February 2009, Nadiadwala announced that Electra wouldn't be appearing in the music video and was replaced by the music group RDB. According to Nadiadwala, \\"It is not a music video but a song that we will use as an integral part of the film. It will occur close to the film's interval. It will also be the first promotional song.\\" The first trailer of the film was shown alongside the release of Jehangir Surti's film Aa Dekhen Zara (2009).

The concept contrasts with that of organized religion, as found (for example) in the theocracies of the early urban cultures of the Ancient Near East or in world religions as they have developed. The term Urreligion originated in the context of German Romanticism.

In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a creation may be the base of primality. (e.g. Biblical literalism, or literal belief in the Hindu Puranas).

History Camp Holloway airfield, 13 April 1966 Camp Holloway was established in 1962. It was located along Route 19 approximately 3km east of Pleiku in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The camp was named in 1963 for Piasecki CH-21 helicopter pilot Warrant Officer Charles E. Holloway, who in December 1962 became the first aviator assigned to the 81st Transportation Company to be killed in action. The 81st Transportation Company, re-equipped in 1963 with UH-1 helicopters, later became the 119th Assault Helicopter Company. A Viet Cong attack in the early morning hours of February 7, 1965, killed eight, wounded 108 and destroyed 18 aircraft. This prompted U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to begin bombing North Vietnam. In December 1965 the 170th Aviation Company joined with the 119th to create the 52nd Aviation Battalion. The base eventually expanded to house the headquarters of the 52d Combat Aviation Battalion, now part of the 17th Combat Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade.

Compert Mong√°in The tale Compert Mong√°in (the Conception of Mong√°n), which survives in three variants, has Mong√°n fathered on Fiachnae's wife C√°intigern by the sea-god Manann√°n mac Lir while F√≠achnae campaigned alongside √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in of D√°l Riata. The versions have different accounts of how this came about, all of which agree that some form of bargain was struck whereby Fiachnae's life was saved by Manann√°n in return for a night with C√°intigern. An early version of this tale is found in the Immram Brain where Manann√°n prophecies Mong√°n's birth and near divine nature to Bran. Although the surviving versions of the tale are from the 10th or 11th century, earlier versions are believed to have been included in the lost C√≠n Dromma Snechtai manuscript. The verses in which the claims of Mong√°n's divine parentage and tutoring are made are described by Charles- Edwards are \\"literary conceit\\" and by Carney as \\"poetic hyperbole\\", the presumed original intent being to vaunt Mong√°n's seamanship.Carney, pp. 504‚Äì504; Charles-Edwards, p. 202; MacKillop, pp. 218‚Äì219, \\"Fiachnae mac B√°et√°in\\" & pp. 333‚Äì334, \\"Mong√°n\\"; Wiley, Compert Mong√°in. Manann√°n takes Mong√°n away with him to T√≠r Tairngire‚Äîthe land of promise, an otherworld similar to T√≠r na n√ìg‚Äîwhere he learned shapeshifting and other esoteric knowledge. While Mong√°n is in the otherworld, his father is killed by Fiachnae mac Demm√°in, an event which the Irish annals place after Mong√°n's death.The internal chronology of Compert Mong√°in ocus Serc Duibe Lacha do Mong√°n, in Meyer, Appendix V, places Fiachnae's death when Mong√°n is around six years old. Mong√°n's ability to change his shape is alluded to in the 9th century tale De Chophur in d√° Muccado (The quarrel of the two swineherds), found in the Book of Leinster, which is one of the stories setting the scene for the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge.Carney, p. 470; Kinsella, pp. 46‚Äì50 & 260‚Äì261. The Ulstermen ask Manann√°n to send Mong√°n to rule over them, but he remains in the otherworld for a further ten years, returning to Ulster when he is sixteen. An agreement is made that Ulster will be divided between Fiachnae mac Demm√°in and Mong√°n, and that Mong√°n will marry Fiachnae's daughter Dub Lacha. Mong√°n later kills his father-in-law in revenge for his father's death, again chronologically at odds with the surviving record which has Fiachnae mac Demm√°in killed several years after Mong√°n.MacKillop, pp. 333‚Äì334, \\"Mong√°n\\"; Meyer, Appendix V. The chronology of the annals is uncertain, but the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach are both in agreement as to the sequence of events, which is that F√≠achnae mac B√°et√°in is killed in battle against Fiachnae mac Demm√°in the year following Mong√°n's death, and that Fiachnae mac Demm√°in was defeated and killed by Connad Cerr two years after Mong√°n's death. Finn reborn One tale recounts a dispute between Mong√°n and the poet Forgoll, Forgoll being perhaps based on traditions about the historical poet Dallan Forgaill. Forgoll claims to know how Fothad Airgthech, a legendary High King of Ireland died, but Mong√°n says he is wrong. Forgoll threatens to curse and satirise Mong√°n for this insult to his knowledge and will settle for nothing less than Mong√°n's wife Breothigernd in reparation. A mysterious stranger appears who claims that Mong√°n was with him when he slew Fothad, and proves Forgall wrong. The story ends by revealing that the stranger was the legendary fianna hero Ca√≠lte mac R√≥n√°in and that Mong√°n was the reincarnation of Finn mac Cumaill.Byrne, p. 112; Meyer, Appendix II; Wiley, Sc√©l asa mberar co mbad h√© Find mac Cumaill Mong√°n ocus an√≠ d√≠a fil aided Fothaid Airgdig; MacKillop, pp. 333‚Äì334, \\"Mong√°n\\". Otherworld Two short tales survive which associate Mong√°n with the otherworld, both dating from the late 10th or early 11th century.Wiley, Sc√©l Mong√°in; Wiley, Sc√©l Mong√°in. One is Sc√©l Mong√°in, a story concerning Mong√°n and the poet Forgoll. This has the two meet a poor student whom Mong√°n takes pity on and sends to the otherworld to bring back gold, silver and a precious stone, the silver which the student is to keep for himself. Little occurs in the tale which concentrates on the magnificence of the otherworld.Meyer, Appendix III; Wiley, Sc√©l Mong√°in. The second, Tucait Baili Mong√°in (\\"What caused Mong√°n's Frenzy\\"), is said to take place in the year in which Ciar√°n of Clonmacnoise died and Diarmait mac Cerbaill became King of Tara following the death of T√∫athal M√°elgarb, events dated to the year AD 549. Mong√°n's wife Findtigernd asks him to recount his journey to the otherworld. When they are at the hill of Uisnech, a supernatural hailstorm comes on. When it ends Mong√°n, his wife, his poet, and seven companions, find a hall ringed by trees. They enter, are greeted by the inhabitants, and Mong√°n is given to drink, after which he recounts his journey. Although it seems as though they are in the house for only a short time, when they leave a year has passed, and they are now at Rath Mor, Mong√°n's home near modern Larne, 150 miles away.Meyer, Appendix IV; Wiley, Tucait Baili Mong√°in. Wives and children and poets In the tale of Forgoll and Fothad, Mong√°n is said to be married Breothigernd.Meyer, Appendix II; Wiley, Sc√©l asa mberar co mbad h√© Find mac Cumaill Mong√°n ocus an√≠ d√≠a fil aided Fothaid Airgdig. Tucait Baili Mong√°in names his wife Findtigernd.MacKillop, pp. 333‚Äì334, \\"Mong√°n\\". The Banshenchas or Lore of Women contained in the Book of Leinster, attributed to a Leinster poet named Gilla Mo-Dutu (died 1147), also names Dub Lacha as Mong√°n's wife.Meyer, Appendix IX. An alternative version of the Compert Mong√°in, Compert Mong√°in ocus Serc Duibe Lacha do Mong√°n (The conception of Mong√°n and Mong√°n's love for Dub Lacha), contains a lengthy romance concerning Mong√°n and another wife, Dub Lacha, daughter of Fiachnae mac Demm√°in, in which Brandub mac Echach is a major character. This story makes frequent use of Mong√°n's otherworldly shapeshifting and magical powers.MacKillop, p. 52, \\"Brandub\\", pp. 154‚Äì155, \\"Dub Lacha\\", & pp. 333‚Äì334, \\"Mong√°n\\"; Meyer, Appendix V. Austin Clarke's play The plot succeeds; a poetic pantomime (1950) is a comedy based on the tale of Mong√°n and Dub Lacha. A third tale concerning Mong√°n and a poet, this time Eochaid R√≠g√©iges, again perhaps based on the historical poet Dallan Forgaill, purports to explain why he had no children. The tale recounts a journey by Mong√°n and Eochaid where they are asked to explain the meaning of various place names‚Äîa branch of poetical learning called dindshenchas‚Äîand on each occasion Eochaid is shown up by Mong√°n. As a result, Eochaid curses Mong√°n so that he will have no noble-born children and that his descendants will be peasants.Wiley, Cid dia tall Eochaid R√≠g√©iges degiartaige √≥ Mong√°n?; MacKillop, p. 185, \\"Eochaid √âigeas\\". Yeats took Mong√°n as a subject in his writings, including the poems \\"Mongan laments the Change that has come upon him and his Beloved\\" and \\"Mongan thinks of his past Greatness\\" (The Wind Among the Reeds, 1899).

It is accompanied by a poem attributed to B√©cc Bairrche mac Blathmaic, king of Ulaid. Whitley Stokes translated it as follows: > The wind blows cold over Islay; > there are youths approaching in Kintyre: > they will do a cruel deed thereby, > they will slay Mong√°n, son of F√≠achnae.Anderson, pp. 147‚Äì148; Annals of > Tigernach, AT 626.6.

In one passage, a Dutch prostitute who had been interrogated by Tholen complains that \\"since the war [i.e. the Nazi WWII occauption], our police had learned too much from the Germans\\". However, in no scene where Tholen directly appears does his conduct bear out such accusations of brutality. Touching on sensitive issues of foreign relations and national security, Tholen works closely with the aristocratic diplomat Van Renkum, who is related to the Dutch Royal Family and seems - though is never explicitly stated to be - involved with his country's security service.

History thumb The station was opened in 1857 by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at the terminus of its line from Grantham, originally built by the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway.Kingscott, G., (2004) Lost Railways of Nottinghamshire, Newbury: Countryside Books The station was designed by the local architect Thomas Chambers Hine. GNR trains originally used the Midland station in Nottingham, but there were frequent disputes, especially when the GNR began running through trains from London King's Cross via Grantham in a shorter time than the Midland Railway could manage. To solve the problem, the GNR opened its own station served by a new line from near Netherfield, adjacent to the Midland line whose tracks it had previously used. When Nottingham Victoria railway station was opened in 1900, the Great Northern had to construct a new chord line, carried mainly on brick arches and steel girders, by means of a junction at Trent Lane, east of London Road, to Weekday Cross where it joined the Great Central main line. The new chord line included a station on an island platform, reached by means of a staircase from the booking office on the same approach road to the earlier London Road terminus. To avoid confusion the new station was designated 'High Level' and the old station renamed 'Low Level'. The transfer to Victoria Station gave the Great Northern a prestigious location and avoided their need to reverse trains to and from Grantham, Derbyshire, and north of Nottingham. Passenger services at the low level station were substantially reduced with the opening of the Victoria station and the last passenger service ran on 22 May 1944. The station however remained open as a mail depot for troops during the Second World War before becoming a parcels depot until the 1970s.LNWR GNR Joint Railway, \\"London Road\\". Passengers services to the High Level station were withdrawn on 3 July 1967 when the service to Grantham was diverted to Nottingham Midland station. This left the only service using Victoria Station as that to Leicester Central and Rugby Central on the former Great Central route. High Level platform in 1992  Present day  Although severely damaged by fire in 1996, the station building has been restored and was converted to a Holmes Place health and fitness club. It is now used as a Virgin Active Health Club. The High Level station was demolished in 2006.  References  *A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain.

He was commissioned as a member of the Church Army and admitted to the office of evangelist (certificate). Garner moved with his wife Sharon to Luton, Bedfordshire, where they began a new Christian community sometimes referred to as a church plant, meeting in a local primary school. The church grew quite rapidly to a membership of about 80 within 2 years. After two years the more traditional incumbent closed the work down and the church plant was unable to continue. Having been offered several jobs the Garners moved to Northern Ireland to take a position with Lisburn Cathedral. The nature of the work was in an estate on the edge of the city of Lisburn. The estate, known as the Hillhall Estate, was locally familiar as a paramilitary area and one daubed with paramilitary insignia, typical of those in the area. After leaving Northern Ireland, the Garners moved to Sheffield. Charitable work Garner began a charity (Freespirit) which provided a form of transparency and accountability.

Life and work Nadal was born into an academic family in Buenos Aires, his mother was an anthropologist and visual artist and his father, Enrique Nadal, a film director and a leading fighter for the recognition of the rights of black Argentines.Reggae-local man, an international character translated website According to his own recollection, he was heavily influenced by the music listened to by his parents, mainly blues and jazz. His ideology involves deep Rastafarian culture from countries like Jamaica and Haiti; one of his inspirations, as with many reggae groups, is Bob Marley. His main influences are related to reggae rhythms and Afro-Argentine culture. Nadal is descendant of Angolan slaves brought to Buenos Aires in the 17th century. He is fluent in Spanish, English and Jamaican Patois. In 1984 he played for the first time as a singer in a band. A year later he founded the band Todos Tus Muertos, which blended together reggae with punk influences and hip hop. With this mix, the group was very successful and recorded their first album in 1988 followed by a record deal with Universal Music. Influenced by reggae rhythms and the music of the Afro Argentine community, Nadal is best known for his work with Todos Tus Muertos. Created in the 1980s and separated in 2000, the band produced six albums before its dissolution. In the 1990s, Nadal formed Lumumba, a reggae band, along with his friend, Pablo Molina (also from Todos Tus Muertos) and his brother, Amilcar Nadal. In its short but productive history, it released four albums which met with approval by followers of reggae, but then it was dissolved. In the last albums of Todos Tus Muertos and Lumumba, Fidel felt the need to play more reggae and leave the hard music behind, but when both projects disappeared, he decided to go on by himself. In 2001, this new project was born, with a completely rastafarian image and style. The same year, he launched three albums, Selassie I Dios Todopoderoso, with much reggae and pure rasta-vibe lyrics, including a cover of Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, Cuando gime la raza, and Cabeza negra, with numerous guest musicians (which gave more variety to the album and made it different from the first one). Finally, Repatriaci√≥n appeared, with a number of collaborators, and with another cover of a Tigres del Norte tune, La Puerta Negra. In 2008 he released the hit single International Love, off the album of the same name, whose dreamier/electronic sound has made it a hit on many Latino radio stations and attracted newer non-reggae listeners. In 2009, his hit single International Love was included on the \\"FIFA Trax\\" on the latest edition of EA Sports football games, FIFA 10. In 2011 he made three remix with reggaeton artist from Puerto Rico and Mexico, two with De La Ghetto in the song \\"Te Robaste Mi Coraz√≥n\\" Remix and \\"Te Robaste Mi Coraz√≥n Cumbia\\" Mix, with Julio Voltio in \\"International Love 2011\\" Remix, and with Adrian Banton \\"Dejenme Fumar\\" Remix. Honors and recognition Nadal was featured twice on the cover of the Rolling Stone (Argentina) - in October 2009 for an edition dedicated to reggae ‚ÄúEl Rasta Que Revolucion√≥ el Rock Latino‚Äù (The Rasta that Revolutionized Latin Rock) and January 2012 in an edition dedicated to Argentine reggae. In 2011, Fidel received two Latin Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Album Forever Together and Best Alternative Song ‚ÄúTe Robaste Mi Coraz√≥n.‚Äù Fidel Nadal is currently recording new music and touring locally and internationally as a solo artist and with Todos Tus Muertos and Lumumba. His Pan-African consciousness and Afro-Argentine identity blend throughout his three decades of music and inspire solidarity, love, movement and unity.

Pedestrianism was to be a popular spectator sport during the 18th and 19th centuries, as equestrianism still is, and bicycle racing became afterwards. Among the most famous professional pedestrians of that time was Robert Barclay Allardice, who completed one mile (1.6 km) in each of 1000 sequential hours. In 1911, the Centurion title was set up as an award for amateur racewalkers. The first number was awarded to James Edwin Fowler-Dixon for a performance in London in 1877, and who was also elected the first president. Each successful Centurion earns the next number in sequence. That number belonging to the recipient in perpetuity. Since 1902, 100 mile (160.9 km) racewalks have been performed on a regular basis, with 94 held as of 2017. Centurion qualifying races are held annually in the United Kingdom, including the Isle of Man. In addition to the British Centurions, Centurion clubs with their own qualifying races exist in the Netherlands, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Each club worldwide holds the same high standard. Members must walk a distance of 100 miles (160.9 km) within 24 hours.

McLeod and starring Bing Crosby, Madge Evans, and Edith Fellows. Based on the novel The Peacock Feather by Leslie Moore and a screenplay by Jo Swerling, the film is about a singer wrongly imprisoned who promises a condemned fellow inmate that he will help the family of his victim when he is released. The singer delays his dream of becoming a gondolier in Venice and becomes a street singer in order to help the young girl and her elderly grandfather. His life is further complicated when he meets a beautiful welfare worker who takes a dim view of the young girl's welfare and initiates proceedings to have her put in an orphanage. Pennies From Heaven remains most noteworthy for Crosby's introduction of the titular song, a Depression-era favorite, since recorded by numerous singers. The film features Louis Armstrong in a supporting role. In 1937, the film received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (Arthur Johnston and Johnny Burke). This was Crosby‚Äôs first independent production jointly with Emanuel Cohen‚Äôs Major Pictures and he had a share in the profits. The film was distributed by Columbia Pictures. Plot In prison, Larry Poole (Bing Crosby), a self-described troubadour, is approached by an inmate named Hart (John Gallaudet) who is on his way to the electric chair. Hart asks Larry to deliver a letter to a family called Smith near Middletown, New Jersey. After finding the family, which consists of a grandfather (Donald Meek) and a young girl named Patsy (Edith Fellows), Poole tells them that the letter holds a key, reveals that the condemned man had unintentionally killed Patsy's father and that he is giving the Smith family his old house and former hideout, the only thing he has to give as atonement. Susan Sprague (Madge Evans) represents the county welfare department and it is her job to see that Patsy is raised \\"properly\\", or the girl will go to an orphanage. A variety of misadventures befall Larry as he tries to help \\"Gramps\\" out with Patsy to save her from the orphanage, all while Susan and he are falling in love. To get cash for a restaurant license, Larry gets a stunt job at the circus, but is injured. While he is in hospital Gramps comes to let him know that the county has taken Patsy away. Larry believes Susan went behind his back and had Patsy placed in the orphanage. It is discovered that Susan had no part in it, but she loses her job defending Larry and his care of the child. Larry has the circus perform for the children so that he can 'break Patsy out', when Patsy lets Larry know how Susan feels about him. Their attempt to free Patsy fails. Afterwards, Larry finds out that Susan has gone to New York and he goes there to find her. While in New York, Susan is approached by two policemen looking for Larry, not to arrest him as she suspects, but to bring him back to the head of the County Welfare Department to help deal with Patsy, who has gone on a hunger strike. The policemen are watching Susan's apartment in the hopes that Larry will show up. When he does, they make him leave with them, after he and Susan reveal their feelings for each other. When they return to the orphanage, the head of the welfare department begs Larry to help them with Patsy. Larry agrees to adopt Patsy and raise her with the help of Susan, who agrees to marry him and be a mother to Patsy. Cast * Bing Crosby as Larry Poole * Madge Evans as Susan Sprague * Edith Fellows as Patsy Smith * Louis Armstrong ¬§ as Henry * Donald Meek as Gramp Smith * John Gallaudet as J. C. Hart * William Stack as Clarence B. Carmichael * Nana Bryant as Miss Howard * Tom Dugan as Crowbar Miller * George Chandler as Waiter * Nydia Westman as Slavey ¬§ Although this was not the first time that a black performer was given prominent billing in a major Hollywood release (Paul Robeson had been billed fourth in that same year's Show Boat), special billing was given to Armstrong at the insistence of Bing Crosby, who also insisted on Armstrong's being hired for the movie. Reception Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times commented, inter alia, \\"Conceding that Mr. Crosby is as good-natured as ever and that Miss Evans is so attractive a social worker that we are tempted to apply for relief and be investigated, the chief honors properly belong to little Miss Fellows. Hers really is an exceptional performance for a youngster, skirting the perils of bathos in her tender scenes and playing her rebellious ones with comic impertinence. Mr. Meek as the grandfather, Nana Bryant as the harried superintendent of an orphanage and William Stack as a welfare commissioner are excellent in the supporting r√¥les. In sum, ‚ÄúPennies from Heaven‚Äù is one of Mr. Crosby‚Äôs best.\\" Variety: \\"Pennies from Heaven may qualify as a fair grosser because of Crosby‚Äôs name, but basically it‚Äôs a weak picture with a story that has little movement and only a scattered few mild giggles. It‚Äôs spread pretty thin over 80 minutes, despite a good tuneful score which should be no handicap‚Ä¶ Film won‚Äôt advance Crosby although Crosby may overcome its faults to some extent. Best individual impression is by Louis Armstrong, Negro cornetist and hi-de-ho expert. Not as an eccentric musician, but as a Negro comedian he suggests possibilities. He toots his solo horn to a nice individual score, plus his band chores.

Music and Some Highly Musical People is a history of African-American music by James Monroe Trotter first published in 1878. It represents perhaps the first attempt to assess American music across multiple genres in a single volume. The book includes biographies of more than forty African-American musicians and touring groups.Blum Stephen, Musical Enactment of Attitudes toward Conflict in the United States, in O'Connell, John Morgan, and Salwa El-Shawan Castelo-Branco, eds. Music and conflict. University of Illinois Press, 2010. p237 Notable inclusions were Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield, Henry F. Williams, Thomas J. Bowers, Thomas Greene Bethune, Rachel M. Washington, Sarah Sedgewick Bowers, the Jubilee Singers of Fisk University, and the Georgia Minstrels. Reception The book is an example of a number of works of that era for which \\"uplifting the race\\" was a main goal. As with other works, this task was done while traits such as \\"character, modesty, and industry\\" were emphasized as a way to \\"assure whites\\" that blacks were not a threat. This balance is exemplified by the work of Booker T. Washington, who was at that time beginning his career.Schenbeck 2012, p49-50 Reception of the book initially followed the color line, with most white music critics and historians, especially outside of Trotter's home city of Boston, ignoring the book. Black historians, biographers, and encyclopedists quoted and borrowed freely from the work.Schenbeck 2012, p51 Contents Trotter's work is highly reflective of the society in which it was written. In his discussion of, for example, Elizabeth Greenfield, Trotter is unable to examine problematic coverage of the singer lest he alianate a white audience which would not recognize the negative effects of stereotyping of black musicians. For instance, he quotes with some approval reviews of Greenfield describing her talent as \\"untaught\\" and \\"innate\\", subordinating Greenfield to white, civilized, educated musicians.Schenbeck 2012, p55-56 Historian Lawrence Schenbeck describes how Trotter's work shows examples of the Culture of Dissemblance, that is, rejection of a stereotype by becoming the exact opposite of that stereotype. As an example, Trotter's description of Greenfield emphasized childlike moral perfection.Schenbeck 2012, p56 On the other hand, Trotter's work was itself not immune to the scientific racism of the period, for instance he praises lightness of skin and repeats arguments of phrenologists about the relationship between character and cranium shape.Schenbeck 2012, p57-58 Trotter's coverage of classical music was influenced by a movement to raise classical music and its performance to the level of religious service. A leader in this movement was white journalist John Sullivan Dwight. With this reverence on classical music, Trotter's description of classical soloists such as Thomas Wiggins and Sisieretta Jones become examples of racial culture and uplift through the musical genre itself.Peretti, Burton W. Lift every voice: the history of African American music. Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2008. However, instead of reassuring whites, encroachment by blacks on white cultural territory described in the book was sometimes at best seen as a curiosity and at worst an affront.Schenbeck 2012, p51 Trotter also covered vernacular music. Trotter covered gospel musicians with much approval, particularly the Fisk Jubilee Singers.Darden, Bob. Get Ready!: a new history of black gospel music. A&C; Black, 2004. p119-123 On the other hand, Trotter agreed that minstrelsy was usually \\"disgusting...buffoonery\\". Even so, the book was the first revisionist look at black minstrelsy, an approach which suggests that out of the racist stereotyping and caricature of the style came the chance for musical expression, employment, and audience happiness. As an example, the book discusses the work of the Georgia Minstrels. Influence Eileen Southern calls the book, \\"the first time that anyone, black or white, had attempted to assess a body of American music that cut across genres and styles\\".Schenbeck 2012, p49 The book fits into a body of literature of that era and later. In 1883, white composer Frederic Louis Ritter published a similar book about American music as a whole, Music in America,Southern 1997, p261 which acknowledges Trotter's research on the contributions by African- Americans to vernacular and classical music.Ritter, Fr√©d√©ric Louis. Music in America. C. Scribner's sons, 1884. p390, 400 The book more directly influenced many later works on African-American music, especially by black authors, including Penman Lovinggood Sr.'s Famous Modern Negro Musicians in 1921.Wintz, Cary D., and Paul Finkelman. Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance: KY. Vol. 2. Taylor & Francis, 2004. p744 In 1936, two publications by black authors, Alain LeRoy Locke's, The Negro and His Music and Maud Cuney Hare's Negro Musicians and Their Music, as well as more recent publications such as the work of Eileen Southern, who published The Music of Black Americans: A History in 1971 (second edition in 1983) and began editing the journal The Black Perspective in Music in 1973.

Originally intended as a game for children, the sport has been fit into an adult taste: the size of the cars has increased and they can be self-made, bringing rise to the challenging side of the sport, for example MRC neppis. Neppis cars can also be tuned by cutting away parts of the chassis or adding weight to the bottom, however in some instances, the local rules forbid tuning. Neppis is played on a race track made of sand, which is typically made by smoothing out the sand with the sole. This makes the width of the track approximately equal to the length of an adult foot. The track can include spring-outs and pits. On his/her turn, each competitor \\"neps\\" his/her car by tapping it with the side of a bent index finger.

Most of his stories revolved around a young protagonist, Joseph Todhunter (\\"Tod\\") Moran, who shipped out on tramp freighters during the interwar years.  Life  Pease was born in Stockton on September 6, 1894.Find-A-Grave Memorial: Howard Pease (1894-1974) For most of his life he resided in the San Francisco, California, area, except for those times when he shipped out as a member of the crew on a freighter, searching for new material.Gidmark (2001), 224. Pease decided to become a writer while in the sixth grade,Old Children's Books: Howard Pease, by Truman Price and he wrote his first short story in 1907 during that school year.OAC: Online Archive of California: Register of the Pease (Howard) Papers, 1907-1973 He attended Stanford University in Stanford, California, interrupted his studies for two years of United States Army service in Europe, then returned to graduate. During two summers, he shipped out as a wiper in the engine room of a cargo ship. Peases first published work was a short story that appeared in the June 1921 edition of the childrens magazine The American Boy. He wrote his first novel, The Gypsy Caravan, in the early 1920s, although it was not published until 1930, when it became his fourth published novel. His first published novel was The Tattooed Man, based on two of his voyages and on a walking trip he took along the south coast of France from Marseilles to Italy; it appeared in 1926, and introduced Tod Moran, a young merchant mariner who is the protagonist in most of Peases novels, working his way up from wiper to first mate as the novels - sometimes referred to as \\"the Tod Moran mysteries\\" - progress. Recurring characters in the Tod Moran novels are his friends in the \\"black gang\\" (slang for the engine room crew), Toppy, a Cockney deckhand, and Sven, a Swede, as well as Captain Jarvis, master of the freighter Araby and a father figure to Tod. By the late 1930s, Pease had written The Gypsy Caravan, Secret Cargo, and eight Tod Moran novels. He wanted to branch out beyond the creative constraints imposed by the Tod Moran series, but his editor at Doubleday insisted that he continue to write Tod Moran books exclusively. In response, he wrote Captain Binnacle and The Long Wharf, leading her to relent and allow him to write more on topics others than the adventures of Tod Moran. However, he continued the Tod Moran series as well; indeed, the last of his 22 published novels, Mystery on Telegraph Hill, was a Tod Moran mystery published in 1961. In addition to writing children's stories, Pease taught high school English and in the mid-1940s was the principal at Los Altos Elementary School. He also contributed to journals and reviewed books for The New York Times. Pease died in San Rafael, California, on April 14, 1974. He is buried at Stockton Rural Cemetery in Stockton.  Influence  Philip Roth,https://www.webofstories.com/play/philip.roth/44;jsessionid=7B7356CA992A26920F38C9A775E9FB97 Russell Freedman, Michael Dirda and E. L. Doctorow all cited Pease's stories as childhood influences. Reflected Dirda: \\"For a long period also I sought out the work of Howard Pease, old-fashioned nautical adventures teeming with frequent and arcane allusions to bilge, Lascars, and fo'csles.\\"Dirda (2003), 59. Freedman, who won the Newbery Medal and valued realism and accuracy in children's writing, called Pease his \\"literary hero.\\"Bostrom (2003), 234. The phrase is Bostom's.  Pease and children's literature  Pease was strongly critical of the 1930s world of children's literature (in which he worked) which he stated was a \\"wholly and solely a woman's world‚Äîa completely feminine world\\" subject to \\"tender-minded feminine control.\\" Pease believed that this resulted in a paucity of male authors, depressed wages and a lack of realism in children's stories. Pease expounded these views in an address he delivered in 1939 at an American Library Association \\"pre-conference\\" moderated by Frances Clarke Sayers. While the audience of 400 female librarians concurred with Pease that the lack of male authors and of social realism was a problem, his overall misogynistic tone offended many and damaged his case.Jenkins (1996), 821-826. Nevertheless, Pease's speech provoked discussion in the field and led to, among other things, a review of the criteria by which the Newbery Medal winner was selected.Lundin (2004), 52; Mickenberg (2005), 131. Lundin gives the date of Pease's address as 1937. Pease remained interested in the question of realism in children's literature and corresponded with other authors on the topic, including noted librarian Julia Sauer.Miller (2003), 212-213. In a reversal, a modern critic took Pease to task for creating \\"traditional\\" male heroes who were \\"brave, clever and independent.\\"O'Keefe (2000), 43-44.  Awards  Pease received two literary awards during his life. In 1944, he received the California Commonwealth Book Award for his novel Thunderbolt House, published that year, and in 1946 he was awarded the Children's Book Award from the Children's Book Committee at Bank Street College of Education \\"for a book that deals realistically with problems in the childs world\\" for his novel Heart of Danger of that year.  Papers  Pease's papers are held at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California.

It provided a grammar school education to boys in the parishes of Ruabon and Erbistock. Ruabon Grammar School for Boys became a Denbighshire County secondary school in 1894 and new buildings, including classrooms and laboratories were added in 1896, with further major building works taking place in the 1920s and 1940s. The school's Latin motto was Absque Labore Nihil (). Pupils were divided into four houses: Madog; Cynwrig; Rhuddallt and Wynnstay.  Founding  It was generally assumed that the school was founded in 1575 as this was the date which appeared on the school badge. However, this date is uncertain, as the early school records were completely destroyed in 1858 during the catastrophic fire which gutted Wynnstay, where the records were being kept at the time. Today a date of 1618 is thought to be more accurate. Records show that Thomas Ednyfed (or Nevitt), a Welshman who had made his fortune as a draper in London, England became one of the first benefactors of the school. The school developed as a boys' boarding school. The school originally stood at the top of Ysgoldy Hill, opposite the church, but in 1858 moved to a new site on the Penycae road between Mill Farm and Offa's Dyke. This new building had classrooms and a kitchen downstairs with dormitories upstairs. Famous ex-pupils of Ruabon Boys' Grammar School include: * Tom Ellis, Member of Parliament (Labour) for Wrexham from 1970 to 1983 (but defected to the SDP in 1981) * Frank Harris, writer * Isaac Daniel Hooson, poet and novelist * Meredith Edwards, actor * Nigel Edwards, footballer * Brian Griffiths, footballer * Arwel Hughes, composer and conductor * David Jones, Member of Parliament (Conservative) for Clwyd West and former Secretary of State for Wales * James Idwal Jones, Member of Parliament (Labour) for Wrexham from 1955 to 1970 * Thomas William Jones (later Lord Maelor), Member of Parliament (Labour) for Merionethshire from 1951 to 1966 * Llewelyn Kenrick, the 'father' of Welsh football.  Girls' school  In 1922 a secondary school for girls, later to be known as the Ruabon Grammar School for Girls, was built adjacent to the boys' school. This was housed in temporary wooden buildings and remained so until a new school was opened, opposite the boys' school, in 1962. The school's Welsh motto was Gorau Trysor Enw Da (). The pupils were divided into three houses, Offa (green badge) Wynnstay (red badge) and Madoc (yellow badge.) In 1967 the Ruabon Boys' Grammar School and the Ruabon Girls' Grammar School amalgamated to form the present comprehensive school, Ysgol Rhiwabon. This school is now housed in the buildings of the former girls' grammar school. The site of the former boys' grammar school has been redeveloped for housing with some of the original buildings being conserved.  Sources  * A. N.

After his father died when he was four, he was brought up by his mother Berta, n√©e Weinberg, who led him to art. However, after completing his secondary education in Brno, Litomƒõ≈ôice and Hostinn√©,Ernst Wei√ü ‚Äì Kurzer Lebensabri√ü, he came to Prague to study medicine. In 1908 he finished his studies in Vienna and became a surgeon. He practiced in Berne, Vienna, and Berlin but he developed tuberculosis and tried to recover as a ship doctor on a trip to India and Japan in 1912. In 1913 he met Rahel Sanzara, a dancer, actress and, later, novelist, and their relationship lasted until she died of cancer in 1936. In the same year he met Franz Kafka and they became close friends. Kafka wrote in his Diaries 1914: \\"January 2. A lot of time well spent with Dr. Weiss\\".M.A.Orthofer: Ernst Wei√ü: A Preliminary Survey, Complete Review, Volume II, Issue 4, November, 2001, Weiss was in touch with other writers of the Prague Circle such as Franz Werfel, Max Brod, and Johannes Urzidil.Encyklopedie dƒõjin mƒõsta Brna, In 1914 Weiss returned to Austria to start a military physician career. He served for the duration of World War I on the Eastern Front, ultimately earning a golden cross for bravery. After the war he lived in Prague, then the capital of Czechoslovakia. He gave up medical career in 1920 when he finished working in a Prague hospital. In 1921 he moved to Berlin, and began his most prolific period of writing, publishing nearly a novel a year. This period came to an end when, in 1933, he returned to Prague to care for his dying mother. He could not enter Nazi Germany and so he left for Paris in 1934. There he lived a poor life dependent on help from authors such as Thomas Mann and Stefan Zweig.Dominique Fliegler: Doslov k Jarmile, Praha 1998, He applied for, but did not receive, a grant from the American guild for German cultural freedom. Weiss's last novel, The Eyewitness, written in 1938, describes a young German veteran of World War I, identified as \\"A.H.,\\" who has been sent to a military hospital because he is suffering from hysterical blindness (now termed conversion disorder). The character is evidently modeled on Adolf Hitler, who was indeed treated for conversion disorder at a military hospital in Pasewalk, but scholars dispute to what extent the account is fictional. The writer Walter Mehring claimed in his autobiography that Weiss had access in Paris to Hitler's Pasewalk medical file, which had been sent out of the country for safekeeping by Edmund Forster, the psychiatrist who treated Hitler. The whereabouts of the file today are unknown, however, and the real Edmund Forster disapproved of hypnosis, the treatment used to cure \\"A.H.\\" in Weiss's novel. Weiss committed suicide on 14 June 1940 when German troops invaded the city. His attempt to deal with poison in his hotel room did not succeed immediately, but he died as a result only in the following night in a Paris hospital.

Historically MƒÅori have been known in the UK for their athletic prowess on the rugby field as well as their various artistic skills. In the 1900s, MƒÅori artistic performers toured the UK and some of them decided to stay. MƒÅkereti (Maggie) Papakura of is one example of an early MƒÅori immigrant who came to the country touring with a troupe of performers; she married in 1912 and lived in the UK for the rest of her life. During World War I, significant numbers of MƒÅori troops came to the UK in order to help fight with the British Army (during this time period military service was one of the main reasons why some MƒÅori moved overseas). Many of these were actually housed in Papakura's Oxfordshire mansion. Later on in the 1950s, a small group of MƒÅori residing in the British capital established the London MƒÅori Club. The aim was to promote MƒÅori culture through the performance of traditional songs and war dances. In 1971 the group renamed itself MƒÅori Club.

Known for his distinctive tenor voice, he had a number of chart hits in the United Kingdom during the 1950s. Biography He was born Malcolm James Thomas, in Abercynon, South Wales. He spent much of his childhood in the village of Troedyrhiw, near Merthyr Tydfil after his family relocated there, and sang with the local choir. He first appeared as a stage actor in 1944 when he was cast in Emlyn Williams's comedy The Druid's Rest at the St. Martin's Theatre in London's West End. He went on to appear at the London Hippodrome in the musical comedy Jenny Jones, where his singing abilities were first noted by the critic James Agate who said of him that he was \\"allowed to talk too much and sing too little\\". He followed this up with a role in a variety show organised by the bandleader and impresario Jack Hylton, and a part in the Thornton Wilder play The Skin of Our Teeth at the Piccadilly Theatre, which was directed by Laurence Olivier. He also appeared in the first stage production of the popular BBC Children's Hour programme The Adventures of Larry the Lamb in which he was Dennis the Dachshund, and was an errand boy in the film Bedelia alongside Margaret Lockwood. He was called up for National Service in 1947, and served with the Army in Egypt and Greece, but returned to acting after being demobbed. He appeared in Aladdin and Dick Whittington on ice in Brighton, and in 1952 teamed up with three other vocalists to form the Welsh Street Singers. He went on to support Old Mother Riley in pantomime, then appeared in the revue Going Gay in Eastbourne in 1953, where he befriended the comedian Kenneth Earle. The pair decided to form a double act, but did not like the sound of \\"Earle and Thomas\\". However, after trying out different names they settled on \\"Earle and Vaughan\\". In 1963, Malcolm Thomas changed his name by deed poll to Malcolm Vaughan. Alongside Earle, Vaughan became the straight man in half of a comedy double act in variety theatre. It was here that his singing career began to develop thanks to his strong voice and after the BBC disc jockey Jack Jackson saw Earle and Vaughan performing at the Chiswick Empire in 1955. Jackson was impressed with Vaughan's impersonation of Mario Lanza and arranged an audition with the head of HMV Records Wally Ridley. Ridley encouraged Vaughan to record popular ballads of the day and Vaughan had his first hit with \\"Ev'ry Day of My Life\\" in 1955. The song reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart. \\"Ev'ry Day of My Life\\" was the first of many hits he achieved throughout the latter half of the 1950s, three other major releases being \\"St. Therese of the Roses\\" in 1956, 1957's \\"My Special Angel\\" and \\"More Than Ever\\" (\\"Come prima\\") in 1958. In October 1956, he was scheduled to appear on BBC TV's Off The Record to promote the release of \\"St. Therese of the Roses\\". However, the appearance was cancelled after a BBC committee decided that the song was unsuitable for broadcast because \\"the lyric is contrary both to Roman Catholic doctrine and to Protestant sentiment.\\" The resulting controversy coupled with airplay on Radio Luxembourg ensured the record's success. It climbed to No. 3 and stayed in the UK Singles Chart for five months and ultimately sold half a million copies. Also in 1956, Earle and Vaughan made their debut at the London Palladium in The British Record Show, and in January 1957 they appeared on ITV's Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Later in 1957 Vaughan appeared in that year's Royal Variety Show alongside other 1950s stars, including Ronnie Hilton, Dickie Valentine and David Whitfield. In 1960 he took part in the national preselection to represent the United Kingdom in that year's Eurovision Song Contest, singing \\"Each Tomorrow\\", but he was beaten by Bryan Johnson, whose \\"Looking High, High, High\\" went on to finish in second place. In 1961 Vaughan was inducted into the exclusive entertainment fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats. The rise in popularity of rock and roll saw a dramatic change in musical tastes, and unlike many of his contemporaries, Vaughan's musical career barely survived into the 1960s. However, he continued to act, mostly doing theatre work, and his music continues to be played on the radio. Earle and Vaughan continued as a double act throughout the 1960s before deciding to split up in 1972. Kenneth Earle went on to become an agent, while Vaughan continued on stage, touring in productions of The Good Old Days. He retired in 1982. Vaughan spent a few of his latter years working on the switchboard at the RAF Central Medical Establishment in London. In his later years, Vaughan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 2009, his wife published his autobiography, which helped to raise money for a local Alzheimer's charity. He died, at the age of 80, on 9 February 2010 in Eastbourne, East Sussex, England. He is survived by his widow, Gay(n√©e Hands), and two sons, Daryl Earle Haydn Samuel (born in 1957) and Damon Charles Michael (born in 1963).

During his lifetime, he was the most widely read author in Denmark. Korch wrote 123 novels, several of which were made into popular films. In 1937, Korch was awarded a Danish knighthood in the Order of Dannebrog. He is listed in the book of The 20th century's 100 most important people in Denmark.Petersen, Claus Hagen and Connie Hedegaard, Det 20. √•rhundrede - De 100 mest betydningsfulde personer i Danmark. 1999. Early life Korch was born on 17 January 1876 in the small village of Over Holluf south east of Odense on the island of Fyn, Denmark. He was the son of a teacher and had seven siblings. At the age of 14, Korch left home and began an apprenticeship in business with his uncle in Nyborg. After finishing his apprenticeship, Korch worked for W. L√∏ngreen in Odense, for whom he drove a horse-drawn wagon to farms selling various wares including porcelain and chemicals. Writing career Korch's first story, Jule Toner (Sounds of Christmas) was published in 1892 and his first book of stories, Fyensk Hum√∏r (Humor of Fyn) was published in 1898.Jensen, Niels, Oplysninger om enkelte forfattere - Morten Korch www.litteraturpriser.dk accessdate=2008-07-28 In 1916, at the age of 40, Korch decided to become a full-time author. Korch was a writer of populist stories, which centered on the old-fashioned traditions of farms, small shops and rural merchants. His tales were built around the traditional adventure model of idyll-crisis-idyll. The characters tended to be stereotypes, and the problems clearly marked as a battle between good and evil which were always resolved happily. Beneath Korch's stories, there is a focus on the conservative patriarchal society and the belief in conservative Christian morals. Korch wrote 123 separate titles and sold more than 7 million books in Denmark alone. In 1937, Korch received a knighthood in the royal Danish society of Order of Dannebrog. By 1940, Korch was the mostly widely read author in Denmark, where he was known as \\"Denmark's Morten\\". From 1942 to 1947 he sat on the board of the Danish Writers Union. Legacy Several of Korch's novels were developed into successful movies. In 1950, film director Alice O'Fredericks made the first film of a Korch novel: his 1943 book De r√∏de heste (The Red Horses). The simple story‚Äîyoung newlyweds who try to save the family horse farm from bankruptcy by winning a racing derby‚Äîbecame the biggest box office success in Danish cinema. By 1976, eighteen films had been produced of Morten Korch stories. Danish Historian Ib Bundebjerg wrote that these combined \\"a special Danish popular comedy tradition with a reassuring portrayal of a rural environment at a time of frenzied modernisation.\\" In 1999, Korch was listed in the book of The 20th century's 100 most important people in Denmark. Personal life In 1899 Korch married the niece of his first employer, Elna Marie L√∏ngreen Fyrdendahl, with whom he had five children. After Elna died of tuberculosis in 1907, Korch married a second time, to Sophie Petrea Bruun in 1908 and they had two sons together. Sophie died in 1953, and one year later, on 8 October 1954, Korch died at the age of 78 in Hellerup near Copenhagen. He is buried in Fraugde, Fyn, the parish of his birth.Gravsted.dk - Morten Korch (Danish) Bibliography *Regnebog for Almueskolernes yngste afdeling 1897 *Fyensk hum√∏r (short stories) 1898 *Fyenbosnak (oral stories) 1900 *Sin egen sti (short stories) 1911 *Guldglasuren (short story) 1912 *Sejrgaarden (novel) 1913 *En husmand 1914 *Grundlovsbogen 1914 *En √¶reskrans (short story) 1916 *Familien p√• Ugleg√•rden(novel) 1917 *Flintes√∏nnerne (novel), 1917 *Hans med Sejrskjorten (novel) 1917 *En vagabond (short story) 1918 *Kongem√∏llen (novel) 1918 *Skytten p√• Urup (novel) 1918 *Fru Sara p√• En√∏ (short story) 1919 *Studeprangeren (short story) 1919 *Der br√¶nder en ild (novel), 1920 *Forklarende tekst 1920 *Fra provinsen (short stories) 1920 *Godtfolk (short stories) 1920 *Krybskytten 1920 *Kong Frederiks Korporal (novel and 2 stories) 1921 *Uhrene i R√∏rby (novel)1921 *Junker & Co (novel) 1922 *Bent Billes l√∏fte 1923 *Det gamle guld (novel), 1923 *Den gr√∏nne vogn 1924 *Fort√¶llinger og skitser (short stories) 1924 *Godtfolk : ny samling 1924 *Niels Dros (novel), 1924 *Om fyenske dialekter 1925 *Rolf Snare 1925 *Palle Jarmer (novel) 1925 *K√¶rlighed (2 stories) 1926 *To juleaftener 1926 *Lykkens hjul (novel) 1926 *Den danske jul 1927 *Manden p√• Brusholm 1927 *Perler paa snor (novel), 1927 *I stjernesk√¶r (novel), 1928 *Fynboer 1929 *Landsbyprinsessen (stage play) 1929 *Lykkesmeden (novel), 1929 *Aff√¶ren i M√∏lleby (stage play) 1930 *Ved Stilleb√¶kken (novel), 1930 *Guldskoen (stage play) 1931 *K√¶rlille (novel), 1931 *I morgen f√•r vi sol 1932 *Klokkekilden 1933 *Borgerlune 1934 *Liv og lune (short stories) 1934 *Blomstrende verden 1934 *Byens bedste mand (short story) 1935 *M√∏llen i Lunde 1935 *Det fejreste tr√¶ 1935 *De rige √•r 1936 *Krisen p√• R√∏nneb√¶k (stage play) 1936 *Lykkens luner (stage play) 1936 *Troldsmeden (stage play) 1936 *Fruen p√• Hamre 1937 *Bonden fra Dige (novel) 1938 *Pigen fra Dale 1938 *Bertil Lynge 1939 *Hammerprinsessen 1939 *Kampen om Abildgaarden (novel), 1939 *Indenfor voldene 1940 *Under byens tage (novel) 1941 *Lykkens hjul 1942 *Det gamle teglv√¶rk 1942 *De r√∏de heste 1943 *Den lille juleg√¶st 1943 *Landsbyfolk 1943 *Ved den blaa fjord 1943 *S√∏nnen fra Vingaarden 1944 *Roman om Nikolaj (novel) 1944 *Fynboer (short stories) 1946 *Klokken paa Solbjerg 1946 *Manden paa Naur 1946 *Det store l√∏b 1947 *Fortryllende dage (short stories) 1948 *Min moders minde\\" (essays) 1948 *Morten Korch : 1898 - 22.

It is located in the south-west region of the country on the Huila Plateau, about 120 km SE of Lubango. The park is an area of sandy hills and shrub thicket character. The climate is tropical semi-arid. Bicuar was established as a hunting reserve in 1938, and reformed as a national park in 1964. Historically known for its large mammals, such as the black buffalo, the park suffered heavily in the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002). During this time the animals were mostly or entirely exterminated, but the Angolan Government is now undertaking efforts to rebuild the infrastructure and resettle the animals. Natural features The park is bordered on the east by the Cunene River, one of the few perennial rivers in the region. The dominant vegetation is described as Angolan miombo woodlands and Angolan mopane woodlands, an area of savanna and woodlands on the plateau east of the coastal hills. Portions of the park are seasonally wet or wetland swamps and dambo grasslands. The Bicuar stands at the northern end of a distinct ecoregion known as the Angolan mopane woodland. The area is known for high species richness, variable rainfall, and the importance of mopane trees to the animals and people of the region. The climate of Bicuari is described under the K√∂ppen climate classification system as Temperate highland tropical climate with dry winters (Cwb), and the warmest months temperatures averaging below 22 ¬∞C. Average rainfall is 600‚Äì800 mm/year. Animal life The area has historically been known for large herds of common antelopes, elephants, and other large mammals. All species populations are believed to have been severely reduced during the war (the park was reportedly used as a practice artillery range), poaching, and human encroachment. Since cessation of hostilities, work has begun by the Huila provincial government to rebuild the infrastructure of the park to attract and protect animals. As of 2013, it has been reported that some of the large mammals are returning to Bicuar. The park administrator noted that \\"We are happy with the return of herds of elephants into the municipalities of Quipungo, Matala and Gambos, as the animals are recognising their habitat and are reproducing inside the park.\\". Besides elephants, the park also reportedly supports antelopes, elands, gnus and zebras.

Geography The park covers an area of 22,610 km¬≤. It located in Cuando Cubango Province in the southeastern corner of Angola. The park is bounded on the west and southwest by the Kavango River, on the south by the border with Namibia, on the east by the Cuando River which forms the border with Zambia, and on the north by Longa-Mavinga National Park.Tarr, Peter (2020). Management Plan for the Luengue- Luiana National Park, Kuando Kubango, Angola 2016-2020. Southern Africa Regional Environment Programme. Ecology The majority of the park is open woodland. The predominant trees are species of Burkea, Baikiaea, Pterocarpus, and Erythrophleum in the southern portion of the park, and Erythrophleum, Burkea, Julbernardia, and Guibourtia in the northern areas of the park. The spacing of the trees varies considerably from place to place. The ground is covered with sparse grass, in part due to leached sandy soil which holds little water near the surface. There are small areas of dense woodland in the north-central area of the park. Along the Cuando River are expanses of seasonally- and perennially-flooded grasslands 10-15 kilometers wide, and smaller areas along the park's other rivers. Papyrus is predominant closest to the rivers and in deeper waters, with species of Phragmites and Miscanthus common in shallower water, upstream areas, and seasonally-dry areas. The park is home to a broad variety of wildlife, including large mammals like African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), plains zebra (Equus quagga), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), leopard (Panthera pardus), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), and impala (Aepyceros melampus). The park is home to many smaller mammals and birds, and the park's wetlands are home to migratory and resident water birds. Wildlife was diminished by poaching and over-hunting during the long Angolan Civil War. Wildlife has recovered somewhat since the end of the war, but poaching, bushmeat hunting, and land mines remain threats to its recovery. The park's many land mines kill and maim elephants, African buffalo, hippos, and other large animals. They also impede anti-poaching patrols and limit the park's potential to accommodate eco-tourism. In 2019, HALO Trust, an international NGO dedicated to removing land mines, estimated that 153 minefields remained in Luengue-Luiana and Longa-Mavinga national parks. In July 2019 the Angolan Government pledged $60 million to clear landmines in the region, which HALO and the government hope to complete by 2025.Somerville, Keith. \\"Angola: Demining key to conservation plans\\". Global Geneva, 21 November 2019. Accessed 20 June 2020. Transfrontier conservation area The park is part of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, a group of adjacent protected areas in the upper Zambezi River and Okavango basins that extend across portions of Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The park adjoins Zambia's Sioma Ngwezi National Park across the Cuando River to the east, and Bwabwata National Park to the south in Namibia. History During the colonial period, hunting reserves (coutadas) were established in the region. The area saw little fighting during the 1961-1974 Angolan liberation war. However the region was the scene of fighting during the 1975-2002 Angolan Civil War. The combatants placed thousands of land mines in the park, and many still remain. In September 2019 Prince Harry visited the park and spoke to the urgent importance of removing land mines from the region, and praised the government's recent commitment of funds to land mine removal. The park was created in 2011, by National Assembly Decree (No. 38/11 29 December) which proclaimed the Luengue-Luiana and Mavinga national parks. The new park includes the former Luiana and Mucusso reserves. The park is governed by the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism.

The parks were created to conserve the areas‚Äô high ecological and biological value. Mavinga forms the western border of Africa's largest conservation area, the Kavango-Zambezi Trans- Frontier Conservation Area (KaZa TFCA).  History  Wildlife populations were drastically reduced during the Angolan Civil War (1975 to 2002). The Park was proclaimed in 2011 along with Luengue-Luiana National Park.  Climate  The region has a Tropical Savanna Climate. Average annual rainfall varies from about 600 to 1000 mm.  Geography and access  The road network within the park is fairly well developed, though many of these roads are either in poor condition, or inaccessible because of landmines remaining from the Angolan Civil War.  Biology and ecology  There are five identified habitats in the two parks: open woodland, dense woodland, open grassland, aquatic vegetation, and cultivated land. = Flora = Dense miombo woodland occurs between the Longa and Cuito rivers and dominated by Brachystegias, Julbernadia, Guibortia, and probably Cryptosepalum species. Cultivated land is prominent in the northern areas around the towns of Longa and Cuito Cuanavale. = Fauna = The three-decades long Angolan Civil War contributed to the serious decline of the once abundant wildlife communities, particularly larger mammals. VERISSIMO (2008)states that more than 150 species of mammals occurred historically in Kuando Kubango.(20)  Fire  The landscape of Mavinga National Park is characterized as a fire-dependent Savanna. Lightning during the rainy season can ignite fire. Fires ignited by subsistence farmers resident in the park also occur.  Recreation  Kavango-Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area  The park falls within the Kavango Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA), which embraces contiguous parts of southeast Angola, northern Botswana, northeast Namibia, southwest Zambia, and western Zimbabwe (Figure 1). It contains a mosaic of protected areas, interspersed with extensive communal lands in which small-scale pastoral and agro-pastoral land use is practiced.  Park Management  A park Management Plan was produced in 2016 for the period: 2016‚Äì2020. This plan focuses on key management and development issues with a short-term perspective of 5 years. It sets out the following priorities: Management priorities: Ecological ‚Ä¢ Controlling fires ‚Ä¢ Combatting poaching and illegal logging ‚Ä¢ Improving connectivity with neighbouring conservation areas ‚Ä¢ Reducing human-wildlife conflicts ‚Ä¢ Stopping the spread of urban and cultivation areas ‚Ä¢ Improving knowledge about biodiversity in the park. From an institutional and development perspective, the top priorities are: ‚Ä¢ Removing landmines ‚Ä¢ Clarifying staff structures, job descriptions and performance indicators ‚Ä¢ Construction of park entrance gates and the accompanying offices to control entry/exit ‚Ä¢ Construction of staff accommodation, garages, store-rooms etc.8 ‚Ä¢ Developing partnerships with local communities ‚Ä¢ Raising awareness about the park among residents and authorities ‚Ä¢ Developing park-specific regulations (23) ‚Ä¢ Identifying tourism potential and initiating an investor conference to attract interest.

During the course of the series, he tackled everything from the composite control surfaces to the installation of the engine. The series took the viewer for the first time through the step-by-step process of building a 200 mph kit aircraft, capable of flying from England to the South of France on a single tank of fuel. Episode synopsisProgramme 1 - Research= Mark visits the Popular Flying Association Rally at Cranfield to see some of the 3000 or so home-built and vintage aircraft that have flown in for the weekend. He talks to Graham Newby, the chairman of the PFA and the editor of Flyer Magazine who takes him through the pitfalls of building his own plane. =Programme 2 - Test Flight= Mark travels to the Europa Factory in North Yorkshire where after seeing all the components that go into making a kit, he takes a test flight with Technical Director Andy Draper. In part 2, he starts his private pilot training at Staverton Airport in Gloucestershire with instructor Carl Bowen. =Programme 3 - Building Begins= Mark learns that before he starts to build his aeroplane he must attend a workshop on composite building techniques. His crash course is instructed by expert Neville Eyre. In part 2, back at the workshop, he begins work on his kit plane, starting with the rudder. Some respite from plastics is provided at Gloucester airport where his flying training continues apace. In a regular feature, Dudley Pattison shows us the Isaac's Fury biplane he took fifteen years to build. =Programme 4 - Wings= Filming in the workshop, work begins on the Europa's wings and Mark puts his composite skills to the test. In part 2, he continues his flight training as he learns about climbing and descending. Nigel Marshall and Rob Cooper talk about the Pitenphol Air-camper they built at work in their lunch-hours. =Programme 5 - You Have Control!= Work on the plane continues with the Cockpit module and control yokes. Mark also receives a visit from Neville Eyre, his PFA inspector who checks to see that his work so far is air worthy. Over at Staverton Airport, it's pass the sick bag when he is introduced to \\"stalling\\". Finally, we are introduced to an American aircraft owned by Michael Wells where the propeller is at the back. =Programme 6 - Tell- Tail!= Work on the aeroplane moves to the tailplane and Mark gets to grips with an electronic spirit level. Back at the Flying School, he attempts circuits and touch and go landings. And in another profile of kit aircraft builders, it's the turn of Olle Berquist, an enthusiast from Sweden. =Programme 7 - Get in Trim= This episode sees the building gathering pace as Mark installs the cockpit module and seats into the aeroplane as well as the trim tabs and actuator into the tail plane. In our regular look at the world of kit aircraft, we meet Steve Pike and Kevin Fagan who have just finished an Australian aircraft - The Jabiru. Back at Staverton Airport, it's a milestone in Mark's Flying progress - with his first solo flight. =Programme 8 - Like my Wheels?= Mark is back on familiar ground as he fits brakes, wheels and undercarriage to his aeroplane, Martin Dovey introduces us to his vintage kit plane, the Kit Fox, and it is the turn of navigation to further perplex Mark as he continues his flying lessons. =Programme 9 - No Longer Topless= The programme sees major progress on the plane with the rudder assembly completed and the fuselage top on and finally bonded. Back at Staverton, Mark masters the rudiments of radio communication. In another look at other kit-planes, we meet fellow Europa constructor Peter Kember who was the first ever to home-build a Europa Kit. =Programme 10 - All Revved Up= It's a red-letter day down at the workshop as the brand new engine arrives with Europa's Andy Draper. Mark takes on the delicate task of fitting the engine to the fuselage as well as connecting fuel lines, the plenum chamber and exhaust manifold. In his flying lesson, he undertakes his first solo cross-country flight. In another feature on the world of home-built aircraft, we meet John Shanley and his futuristic Rutan Long-EZ. =Programme 11 - Props Away= Part two of the engine installation and Mark takes on the fitting of the ducting, oil and water cooling, radiators, cowlings and finally the propeller. Safety is the theme in Mark's next visit to flying school as he takes us through the A-Check, vital before any flight, while this programme's homebuilder is Lincoln Summers with his motorbike-engined Avid Speedwing. =Programme 12 - Instru-Mental= It's the bit Mark has been dreading since he started - the wiring and instruments. To give him a better idea, he meets Robin Walsh who explains the differences between instruments and avionics and Ashu Mehta who helps him install the instrument panel. The instrument theme is continued at Aeros Flying School where Mark gets to fly just inches from the ground - in a simulator. In another look at the achievements of other home builders, it's the turn of Bob Harrison and his Europa. =Programme 13 - he Final Plush= The interior starts to get the red carpet treatment (well Blue actually) as Mark takes on the job of carpeting and upholstering his aeroplane with aircraft trimmer Matthew Leach. At Aeros, it's advanced flying as he gets to grips with steep banked turns and spinning while vintage aircraft feature in another look at PFA aircraft, this episode profiles Steve Leach's 1941 Taylor craft BC65. =Programme 14 - Any Colour You Like= A Red letter day as Mark prepares for his PPL Test at Aeros, and we recap his flying lessons from throughout the series; meanwhile, his aeroplane is transformed with a coat of paint and Mark applies the decals to make it unique. Finally it is the turn of Tony Palmer to show us his own pride and joy - his Avid Speedwing. =Programme 15 - Up, Up & Away!= The final episode in the series sees the newly built plane go through the final checks it needs for its certificate of air-worthiness. Mark must see if it will pass and he can finally realise his dream to fly his very own aeroplane.

Drago»ô established a polity there as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1350s. The independence of the Principality of Moldavia was gained when Bogdan I, another Vlach voivode from Maramure»ô who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. It remained a principality until 1859, when it united with Wallachia, initiating the development of the modern Romanian state. Competing cultures in the future region of Moldavia Moldavia developed in the lands between the Carpathian Mountains and the Dniester River, which had been dominated by nomadic Turkic peoples‚Äîthe Pechenegs, Ouzes and Cumans‚Äîfrom around 900. The neighboring Principality of Halych and Kingdom of Hungary started to expand their authority over parts of the territory from around 1150, but the Golden Horde‚Äîa Mongol and later Turkicized khanate‚Äîtook control of the lands east of the Carpathians in the 1240s. The Mongols promoted international commerce, and an important trade route developed along the Dniester. The circulation of Hungarian and Bohemian coins shows that there were also close economic contacts between the basin of the Moldova and Central Europe in the early . In addition to the dominant Turkic population, medieval chronicles and documents mention other peoples who lived between the Carpathians and the Dniester, including the Ulichians and the Tivercians in the , and the Brodnici and the Alans in the . The Vlachs' presence in that territory is well documented from the 1160s. Their local polities were first mentioned in the : the Mongols defeated the Qara-Ulagh, or Black Vlachs, in 1241, and the Vlachs invaded Halych in the late 1270s. = The Vlachs‚Äîthe earliest Romanians‚Äîand their neighbors = runestone G134 referring to \\"Blakumen\\" whom many historians identified as Vlachs (Sjonhem cemetery, Gotland, Sweden) The Moldavian region‚Äîthe lands between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester River‚Äîacquired a territorial identify in the . During the previous millennium, the region had been subject to invasions by nomadic peoples, followed by a peaceful period around 750 during the Khazar Khaganate, which led to growth of the population the region. A new material culture‚Äîthe \\"Dridu culture\\"‚Äîspread in the lands along the Lower Danube (in both present-day Bulgaria and Romania) and in the territory east of the Carpathians. After the arrival of the Magyars to the Pontic steppes north of the Black Sea in the 830s, the local inhabitants fortified their settlements with palisades and deep moats along the Dniester in the . Ulichians, Tivercians \\"Waladj\\", and \\"BlaghƒÅ\\" are ethnic groups connected with the Vlachs, or Romanians, of the region of the Carpathians. Victor Spinei wrote that a runestone which was set up around 1050 contains the earliest reference to Romanians living east of the Carpathians. It refers to Blakumen who killed a Varangian merchant at an unspecified place. A competing group, the Magyars, left the Pontic steppes for the Carpathian Basin after a coalition of the Pechenegs and the Bulgarians defeated them at the end of the . The Pechenegs took control of the territory, but most Dridu settlements survived their arrival. Only the fortifications were destroyed in the 10th or early . New settlements appeared along the lower course of the Prut. The local inhabitants' burial rites radically changed: inhumation replaced cremation and no grave goods can be detected after around 1000. =Mongol invasion and occupation= According to the Persian historian, Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, a Mongol army \\"proceeded by way of the Qara-Ulagh, crossing the and defeating the Ulagh peoples\\" during the Mongol invasion of 1241. His narrative shows that the \\"Quara-Ulagh,\\" or Black Vlachs, lived in the Eastern or Southern Carpathians. Giovanni di Plano Carpini, a papal envoy to the Great Khan of the Mongols, met a \\"Duke Olaha\\" who \\"was leaving with\\" his retinue to the Mongols in 1247. Victor Spinei, Vlad Georgescu and other historians identify the duke as a Vlach ruler, because his name is similar to the Hungarian word for Vlach (ol√°h), but the name may have also been a version of Oleg. Friar William of Rubruck, who visited the court of the Great Khan in the 1250s, listed \\"the Blac\\", or Vlachs, among the peoples who paid tribute to the Mongols, but the Vlachs' territory is uncertain. Rubruck described \\"Blakia\\" as \\"Assan's territory\\" south of the Lower Danube, showing that he identified it with the northern regions of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Archaeological finds‚Äîkilns to produce pottery and furnaces to puddle iron ore‚Äîidentify towns that were important economic centers of the Golden Horde. At Orheiul Vechi, the ruins of a mosque and a bath were also excavated. The local inhabitants used high quality ceramics (amphorae-like vessels, pitchers, mugs, jars and pots), similar to those found in other parts of the Golden Horde. The Mongols supported international commerce, which led to the formation of a \\"Mongol road\\" from Krak√≥w along the Dniester. Almost 5000 Mongol coins from the first half of the have been excavated in the same region. At the mouth of the Dniester, Cetatea AlbƒÉ (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine) developed into an important emporium. It was established by Genoese merchants in the late . Weapons and harness pieces from the 13th and that have been found together with agricultural tools at Vatra Moldovi»õei, Co»ôna and CozƒÉne»ôti shows the existence of either local elites or armed peasant groups between the Carpathians and the upper courses of the Siret. Hungarian and Bohemian coins were in circulation in the same territory during the first half of the . The local inhabitants used pottery of lower quality than those used in the lands directly controlled by the Mongols. = Decline of the Golden Horde = The earliest contemporary reference to Romanians in Maramure»ô was recorded in a royal charter in 1326. In that year, Charles I of Hungary granted the \\"land Zurduky\\" (now Str√¢mtura in Romania) in the \\"district of Maramure»ô\\" to a Vlach noble, Stanislau. According to the Moldo-Russian Chronicle, which was preserved in a Russian annals completed in 1505, King Vladislav of Hungary sent envoys to invite the \\"Old-Romans and the Romanians\\" to fight against the Mongols and afterwards he rewarded the \\"Old-Romans\\" with lands in Maramure»ô. Historians Ionel C√¢ndea and Dumitru »öeicu identify this event with the battle of H√≥d Lake (1280), Cuman opponents being substituted in the chronicle by tartars. Historians Pavel Parasca and »òerban Papacostea identify \\"King Vladislaus\\" with Ladislaus IV of Hungary who reigned between 1270 and 1290. With the disintegration of the Golden Horde after the death of √ñz Beg Khan in 1341, both Poland and Hungary started to expand towards the steppe zone in the 1340s. Casimir III of Poland invaded the Principality of Halych already in 1340. Two 14th-century chronicles‚Äîone by John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë and the other by an anonymous Minorite friar‚Äîsay that King Louis I of Hungary dispatched Andrew Lackfi, Count of the Sz√©kelys, to lead an army of Sz√©kely warriors against the Mongols who had made raids in Transylvania. Lackfi and his army inflicted a crushing defeat upon a large Mongol army on 2 February 1345. The Sz√©kelys again invaded the \\"land of the Tatars\\" in 1346. According to both chronicles, the Mongols withdrew as far as the Dniester after their defeats. Archaeological research shows that forts were erected at Baia, Siret, Piatra Neam»õ and T√¢rgu Trotu»ô in the late 1340s. The founding of Moldavia Both Poland and Hungary took advantage of the decline of the Golden Horde by starting a new expansion in the 1340s. After a Hungarian army defeated the Mongols in 1345, new forts were built east of the Carpathians. Royal charters, chronicles and place names show that Hungarian and Saxon colonists settled in the region. Drago»ô took possession of the lands along the Moldova with the approval of King Louis I of Hungary, but the Vlachs rebelled against Louis's rule already in the late 1350s. Drago»ô was succeeded by his son, Sas, but Sas' son was expelled from Moldavia by a former voivode of Maramure»ô, Bogdan, in the early 1360s. Bogdan, who resisted Louis's attempts to restore Hungarian suzerainty for several years, was the first independent ruler of Moldavia. The earliest Moldavian silver and bronze coins were minted in 1377. The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople acknowledged the Metropolitan See of Moldavia, after years of negotiations, in 1401. The dates on coins found in the area indicate the change of status of Moldavia from Mongolian rule to Vlach rule. The minting of Mongol coins continued in Orheiul Vechi until 1367 or 1368, showing that a \\"late Tatar state\\" survived in the southern region between the Prut and the Dniester. No Mongol coins minted after 1368 or 1369 have been found in the region of the Dniester, showing that the Mongol rulers did not control the territory any more. Moldavia initially included a small territory between the Prut and Siret. Louis exempted the merchants of \\"Demetrius, Prince of the Tatars\\" from paying taxes in Hungary in exchange for securing the tax exempt status of the merchants of Bra»ôov in \\"the country of Lord Demetrius\\". =Arrival of Drago»ô in Moldavia and his \\"dismounting\\" there= The Coat of arms of Moldavia, depicting an aurochs, the probable quarry in Drago»ô' hunt. Voivode Drago»ô's hunt for the bison (by Constantin Lecca) Romanian histories cite Moldavian chronicles, which credit Drago»ô, a Vlach ruler, with the founding of Moldavia. According to legend, he led a hunting party to the region and dismounted from his horse at the Moldova River‚Äîwhence the name of this event, descƒÉlecat or \\"dismounting\\". It was during this hunting trip that he judged the region to be more attractive for his people than the Land of Maramure»ô in the Kingdom of Hungary, where they were then living. One theory by Nicolae Iorga suggests that the Land of Maramure»ô was one of the \\"Romanias\\" where Eastern Romance ethnic groups (known as Vlachs in the Middle Ages) had survived the Great Migrations. A concurrent theory suggests that the Vlachs of Maramure»ô came from Great Vlachia (in present-day Macedonia) in the second half of the . According to the early 16th-century Moldo-Russian Chronicle, the Vlachs came to Maramure»ô during the reign of King Vladislaus of Hungary to fight against the Mongols. This document represents Drago»ô as one of the Romanians whom \\"King Vladislav\\" had granted estates in Maramure»ô. According to the various versions of the legend of his \\"dismounting\\", Drago»ô left for a hunting, together with his retainers. While chasing an aurochs or bison, they reached as far as the Moldova River where they killed the beast. They liked the place where they stopped and decided to settle on the banks of the river. Drago»ô went back to Maramure»ô only to return with all his people \\"on the fringes of the lands where the Tatars roamed\\". In the time of King Vladislav, the Tatars led by their prince, Neymet advanced from the waters of the Prut and the Moldova against the King sent envoys to the Old-Romans and the Romanians. Thereupon we, Romanians joined forces with the Old-Romans and came to Hungary to help King Before long, the decisive battle was fought between the Hungarian king, Vladislav, and the Tatar prince, Neymet, along the banks of the Tisa. The Old-Romans started the fight, preceding everybody else. They were followed by the masses of the Hungarians and the Romans who were in the Latin faith. Thus the Tatars were defeated first by the Old-Romans, then by the Hungarians and the Vladislav, the Hungarian king rejoiced over the divine assistance. He highly appreciated and rewarded the Old-Romans for their [T]hey asked King Vladislav not to force them to adopt the Latin faith, but to let them keep their own Christian faith according to the Greek rite and to grant them a place to stay. King granted them lands in Maramure»ô between the Mure»ô and Tisa at a place called Crij. The Old-Romans gathered and settled there. They married Hungarian women and led them into their own Christian There was a smart and courageous man, Drago»ô, among them. One day, he left with his companions for a hunt and they came across the footprints of a bison. Following it, they crossed the snowy mountains and arrived at a wonderful and even place where they spotted the bison. They killed it under a willow and feasted on it. Then God brought the idea to his mind that he should find a new homeland and settle [T]hey returned home and spoke of the beauty of that country and of its rivers and springs to the other people so that to convince them to move there. The latter also liked the idea and decided to leave for the place where their companions were staying and to search for a new homeland. It was surrounded by deserted lands and the Tatars and their cattle roamed in the borderlands. Thereupon they asked Vladislav, the Hungarian king, to let them leave, and King Vladislav graciously assented. They left Maramure»ô, together with all their companions and with their wives and children, to cross the high mountains. Many trees were cut down and many cliffs were pushed aside, but they crossed the mountains and arrived at the place where Drago»ô had killed the bison. They liked it and dismounted there. They chose an intelligent man named Drago»ô of their number and appointed him to be their lord and voivode, and thus the country of Moldavia was founded by the will of God. ‚ÄîMoldo-Russian chronicle (Spinei, 1986) Ritual huntings which end with the establishment of a state, a town or a people are popular elements of the folklore of various peoples of Eurasia, including the Hungarians and the Lithuanians. The \\"dismounting\\" by Drago»ô took place in 1359, according to most Moldavian chronicles. Except that the Moldo-Polish chronicle which gives 1352 as the date. However, the same chronicles add various years when determining the period between Drago»ô's arrival to Moldavia and the first year of the reign of Alexander the Good in 1400. For instance, the Anonymous Chronicle of Moldavia mentioned 44 years, but the Moldo-Russian Chronicle wrote of 48 years. Consequently, the date of the dismounting is debated by modern historians. For instance, Dennis Deletant says that Drago»ô came to Moldavia soon after the establishment of the Diocese of Milkovia in 1347. Moldavia emerged as a \\"defensive border province\\" of the Kingdom of Hungary. A version of Grigore Ureche's chronicle stated that Drago»ô's rule in Moldavia \\"was like a captaincy\\", implying that he was a military commander. King Louis I of Hungary mentioned Moldavia as \\"our Moldavian land\\". The province initially included the northwestern part of the future principality (it is now known as Bukovina). In 1360, Louis granted estates to a Vlach lord, Drago»ô of Giule»ôti, for subjugating the Moldavian Vlachs who had revolted against Louis. The identification of Drago»ô of Giule»ôti with the first ruler of Moldavia is debated among scholars. = Bogdan the Founder = Impression of Bogdan I, the 15th-century founder of Moldavia, by Pierre Auguste Bellet (1865‚Äì1924) Most early Moldavian chronicles begin their lists of the rulers of Moldavia with Drago»ô and state that he was succeeded by his son, Sas, who ruled for four years. The only exception is the list of the voivodes, which was recorded in the Bistri»õa Monastery in 1407, which starts with \\"Bogdan Voivode\\". Bogdan, who had been the voivode of the Vlachs in Maramure»ô, gathered the Vlachs in that district and \\"secretly passed into Moldavia\\", according to John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë's chronicle. Royal charters recorded that Bogdan had come into a conflict with J√°nos K√∂lcsei, the royal castellan of Visk (now Vyshkovo in Ukraine), in 1343, and with a Vlach lord in Maramure»ô, Giula of Giule»ôti, in 1349. According to historian Radu Carciumaru, Bogdan's conflict with the royal castellan suggests that he had been opposed to the presence of the representatives of royal authority in Maramure»ô years before he left for Moldavia. The dating of Bogdan's departure from Maramure»ô is uncertain. His estates there were confiscated and granted to the son of Sas, Balc, according to a royal diploma, issued on 2 February 1365. Consequently, Bogdan must have come to Moldavia before that date. Historian P√°l Engel dates Bogdan's arrival as 1359, taking advantage of the power vacuum that followed the death of Berdi Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde. According to Carciumaru, a lasting conflict between King Louis I of Hungary and Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the Lithuanians' victory over the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters in the early 1360s, enabled Bogdan to come to Moldavia and expel Balc in 1363. SƒÉlƒÉgean says that it was only in 1365 that Bogdan seized power in Moldavia with the assistance of local Vlachs. King Louis I of Hungary attempted to restore his rule in Moldavia, but the chronology of the military actions against Bogdan is uncertain. John of K√ºk√ºll≈ë wrote that Bogdan \\"was often battled against\\" by the army of Louis, but the \\"number of Vlachs inhabiting that land increased, transforming it into a country\\". Although K√ºk√ºll≈ë stated that Bogdan was finally forced to accept Louis's suzerainty and to pay a yearly tribute to him, modern historiansincluding Denis Deletant, Tudor SƒÉlƒÉgean, Victor Spinei, and Istv√°n V√°s√°ryagree that Bogdan could actually preserve the independence of Moldavia. =Successors to Bogdan= The Principality of Moldavia at its peak in 1483 The new state derived its name from the Moldova River. In Latin and Slavic documents, it was mentioned as \\"Moldova\\", \\"Moldava\\" or \\"Moldavia\\". On the other hand, the Byzantines, who regarded it as a new Vlachia, referred to the country as Maurovlachia (\\"Black Vlachia\\"), Rusovlachia (\\"Vlachia near Russia\\") or Moldovlachia (\\"Moldavian Vlachia\\"). The Turkish name of MoldaviaKara Boƒüdandemonstrates Bogdan's preeminent role in the establishment of the principality. La»õcu Bogdan was succeeded by his son, La»õcu, around 1367. After Franciscan friars from Poland converted him to Catholicism, La»õcu initiated the establishment of a Roman Catholic diocese in Moldavia in 1370. His direct correspondence with the Holy See shows that he wanted to demonstrate the independence of Moldavia. Upon La»õcu's request, Pope Gregory XI set up the Roman Catholic Diocese of Siret in 1371, addressing his bull to \\"La»õcu, Duke of Moldavia\\". According to SƒÉlƒÉgean, the Holy See \\"consolidated the international status of Moldavia\\" by granting the title \\"duke\\" to La»õcu. On 14 March 1372, King Louis I of Hungary, who had also inherited Poland in 1370, signed a treaty with Emperor Charles IV who acknowledged Louis's rights in many lands, including Moldavia. Petru Mu»ôat La»õcu, who died in 1375, was succeeded by Petru Mu»ôat, according to the earliest lists of the rulers of Moldavia. However, the 15th-century Lithuanian-Ruthenian Chronicle wrote that the Vlachs elected George Koriatovich‚Äîwho was a nephew of Algirdas, Grand Prince of Lithuania, and ruled in Podolia under Polish suzerainty‚Äîto be voivode, but later poisoned him. In late 1377, Vladislaus II of Opole, who administered Halych in the name of King Louis I of Hungary, gave shelter to one \\"Vlach voivode\\", named George, who had fled to Halych because of the \\"unexpected treason of his people\\". According to Spinei, George Koriatovich died in 1375, which excludes his identification with \\"Voivode George\\". Spinei also says that George Koriatovich most probably ruled in southeastern Moldavia which had been liberated from Mongol rule. The first Moldavian silver and bronze coins were minted for Petru Mu»ôat in 1377. According to a record in the register of the Genoese colony in Caffa on the Black See, two Genoese envoys were sent to \\"Constantino et Petro vayvoda\\" in 1386. Historians identified Voivode Constantino with Costea, whom the list of the voivodes of Moldavia, recorded in the Bistri»õa Monastery, mentioned between La»õcu and Peter. The record in the Caffa register suggests that the two voivodes‚ÄîCostea and Petru Mu»ôat‚Äîhad the same position. The division of the medieval principality into two greater administrative units‚Äî»öara de Sus (\\"Upper Country\\") and »öara de Jos (\\"Lower Country\\")‚Äîeach administered by a high official, the vornic, also implies the former existence of two polities, which were united by the Moldavian monarchs. Petru Mu»ôat paid homage to W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland, in Krak√≥w on 26 September 1387. Upon Peter's request, Anton, the Orthodox Metropolitan of Halych, ordained two bishops for Moldova, one of them being Joseph Mu»ôat, who was related to the voivode. However, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople refused to acknowledge their consecration. Petru Mu»ôat expanded his authority as far as the Danube and the Black Sea. His successor, Roman I Mu»ôat, styled himself \\"By the grace of God the Almighty, Voivode of Moldavia and her to the entire Vlach country from the mountains to the shores of the sea\\" on 30 March 1392. After years of negotiations, the Ecumenical Patriarch, Matthew I, acknowledged Joseph Mu»ôat as Metropolitan of Maurovlachia in 1401. Growth of the principality The Principality of Moldavia, grew to include the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester river. It existed until 1859, when it united with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, the state included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and all of Bukovina. The western half of Moldavia is now part of Romania, the eastern side belongs to the Republic of Moldova, while the northern and southeastern parts are territories of Ukraine.
