At the age of 17, she married a doctor, but was widowed after seven years of marriage. In 1858, Meredith began visiting Millbank Prison with the British Society. In 1860 she moved to London with her mother and, concerned with employment opportunities for women, began editing Alexandra magazine. She visited female prisoners in Brixton prison and started a mission offering breakfasts, advice, and limited employment opportunities to newly released women. She reported her visits to the Home Secretary Sir George Grey. Meredith's home at Nine Elms House, 6 Upper Belmont House, Wandsworth Road was known as The Mission to Women and was used by female prisoners leaving prison. Meredith became the Treasurer of the Female Prisoners' Aid Society. Meredith later turned her attention to the children of convicted women and in 1871 her first home for such children was opened in Addlestone, Surrey by Princess Mary. In 1877, she was told that she was no longer permitted to talk to women prisoners without a matron present. From then, she decided to stop visiting.

It was funded by the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund. Its head office and information centre were located in Edmonton, Alberta and a second office in Calgary, Alberta in Canada. History AOSTRA was formed in 1974 for promotion of the development of new technologies for oil sands and heavy-oil production. In 1979 its mandate was expanded also to the conventional crude oil technologies. In 1984, AOSTRA initiated the Underground Test Facility as an in-situ SAGD bitumen recovery facility. In 1986, the Alberta Department of Energy took over AOSTRA's role in developing oil sands technology, and on 1 August 2000, AOSTRA was reorganized into the newly established Alberta Energy Research Institute, and rebranded again to the name of Alberta InnovatesEnergy and Environment Solutions with an expanded role to include other energy-related research areas such as wind, solar, fuel cells, clean coal and biomass. Operations AOSTRA operated primarily through projects, the costs of which were shared with industries. The resultant technology is available to any user at fair market value. AOSTRA also supported research at Canadian universities and research institutions by providing grants to inventors, funding the operation of a technical information system, promoting international co-operation in oil sands development, and providing scholarships and fellowships for educational assistance. One of the main targets of AOSTRA finding of suitable technologies for that part of the Athabasca Oil Sands that could not be recovered using surface mining technologies.

A. Lowe, was a Russian-American palaeographer at the University of Oxford and Princeton University. He was a lecturer, and then reader, at the University of Oxford from 1913 to 1936, and a professor at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study from 1936. Personal life Lowe was born in Kalvarija (Russian Empire) to a Russian Jewish family headed by Charles Loew, a silk and embroidery merchant, and his wife, Sarah Ragoler. He emigrated to New York City with his parents in 1892, becoming a citizen of the United States in 1900. Originally named Elias Avery Loew, he altered the spelling of his name in 1918. His wife, whom he married in 1911 and with whom he had three daughters, was the translator Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter. Among their descendants are English artist Charlotte Johnson Wahl, and her son, journalist and politician Boris Johnson, former Mayor of London and Foreign Secretary, and current Prime Minister of the UK. Although Lowe \\"never abandoned his solidarity with the Jewish people\\", he declined to practise Judaism; towards the end of his life he told one of his daughters that, were he to adhere to a religion, he would opt for Roman Catholicism. Following his death in Bad Nauheim, Germany, his ashes were interred at Oxford's Corpus Christi College. Education and career After studying at the College of the City of New York (now City College of New York) from 1894 through 1897, Lowe obtained a BA at Cornell University in 1902. Thereafter he studied briefly at the University of Halle, and then at the University of Munich where, under the supervision of Ludwig Traube, he completed his doctorate in 1908. He first lectured at the University of Oxford in 1913. The following year, Oxford granted him a regular appointment as lecturer, appointing him reader in 1927. Nearly all of Lowe's palaeography teaching occurred at the latter institution. Although he became one of the first professors at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study (where no teaching was required) in 1936, he continued to lecture at Oxford during Trinity terms until 1948. In addition, he acted as a consultant in palaeography for the Library of Congress, and, from 1911 to 1953, as research associate in palaeography for the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Lowe wrote several important works on early medieval palaeography, including The Beneventan Script (his 1914 study of the oldest extant manuscript of St Benedict's rule), and his collected Palaeographical Papers, 1907–1965 (published posthumously in 1972). He remains best known, however, for the eleven-volume Codices Latini Antiquiores (CLA) which offers a palaeographical guide to all extant Latin literary manuscripts copied in scripts antedating the ninth century. Published 1934–1971, this monumental work covers over 1,800 manuscripts from repositories in twenty-one countries, providing detailed descriptions and one or more facsimiles for each manuscript. An internationally respected authority in his field, Lowe received formal recognition from numerous academies, institutes, and scholarly societies. He was awarded the Medieval Academy of America's Haskins Medal in 1957, the gold medal of the Bibliographical Society in 1959, and had honorary doctoral degrees conferred on him by the University of Oxford (1936), the University of North Carolina (1946), and the National University of Ireland (1964). From 1954 until his death in 1969, he was an Honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College of Oxford University. A series of lectures on palaeography, the Triennial E. A. Lowe Lectures, continues to be held at the College in his memory.

The block, which airs on Saturday mornings, is programmed solely with infomercials, which usually air on networks and broadcast television stations during late night and early morning timeslots; such programming, however, has not previously been scheduled on a regular basis by a major broadcast television network. Beginning on September 13, 2014 in some markets, Weekend Marketplace can be substituted with the internally syndicated Xploration Station block produced by Steve Rotfeld Productions, which provides two hours of educational and informational programming for stations to count toward federally mandated programming requirements; Fox's owned-and-operated stations and Tribune Broadcasting, along with several other affiliate groups and individual stations are currently carrying this block instead. Fox continues to offer Weekend Marketplace to stations which chose to purchase E/I programming off the open syndication market; notably the Fox stations (and one CW station) of Sinclair Broadcast Group are under the latter arrangement until fall 2016, when Sinclair will begin to carry Xploration Station, as are two stations within the E.W. Scripps Company's portfolio (Fox affiliate WFLX and MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD). At least one Sinclair station (WUTV in Buffalo, New York) carries both, carrying Weekend Marketplace on Saturday mornings while splitting the Xploration Station block up and airing it as a weekday strip instead of as a block. OverviewBranding and title issues= Despite being carried by Fox, the block features no network branding or in- house promotional advertising (or even references to the \\"Weekend Marketplace\\" title) for the duration of the block – due to the fact that as it carries infomercials, commercial breaks do not appear during those featured within the block – and is only used mainly as a placeholder title within television listings and industry media; most stations that carry the block disregard this title when they distribute their listings to guide providers, and it usually is listed as four separate segments of \\"paid programming\\" instead so that viewers are not misled about the block's content. In addition, Fox stated that it ultimately intended to have the block contain programs that resemble normal programming (albeit still prominently advertising a product), though this never occurred. Presently the block consists of four traditional 28½-minute infomercials, with short-form direct response commercials airing at the end of each half-hour; no local station breaks are shown beyond a five-second station identification slot (to fulfill Federal Communications Commission rules) at the top of the first hour. =Scheduling= The block normally airs from 10:00 a.m. to Noon Eastern and Pacific Time, the second half of the timeslot previously used for 4Kids TV, the remaining two-hour time period occupied by the first half of the predecessor block was returned to the network's affiliates, for use to air syndicated, locally produced lifestyle brokered programming, or local weekend morning newscasts. Since 2013, when Fox began to carry Fox College Football on Saturday mornings (and its coverage has expanded from that point until late night), the block's scheduling has become more erratic as local stations have begun to carry their own pre-game show programming before the games, along with occasional late morning-early afternoon coverage of Fox College Hoops. In 2019, an 11 a.m. ET/8 a.m. PT pre- game show, Big Noon Kickoff, began to air on Fox, effectively pre-empting Weekend Marketplace from August until the end of November, as the infomercials are not required to be made up elsewhere on the schedule by those affiliates carrying it due to the priority of scheduling E/I programming elsewhere on the weekends. BNK was expanded to two hours in 2020, now airing from 10 a.m. ET/7 a.m. PT. =Affiliate reach= Currently due to the Xploration Station transition and Fox's O&Os; and affiliates owned and/or operated by groups such as Tribune ceasing to carry Weekend Marketplace, the block's reach is unknown; however it previously aired until the 2014-15 season on 95% of Fox's stations, both owned-and-operated stations and affiliates. Most, if not all, of the stations that declined to carry 4Kids TV – such as Miami affiliate WSVN and Detroit owned-and-operated station WJBK – have similarly declined Weekend Marketplace (two of the exceptions are Cleveland affiliate WJW and O&O; KTBC in Austin, which aired the infomercial block after having declined the network's children's block under its Fox Kids, Fox Box and 4Kids TV iterations for many years). However, it does not appear that all of the non-Fox stations that picked up 4Kids TV in such markets have continued with the infomercial block (Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD airs the block, however CW affiliates KASW in Phoenix and WBNX-TV in Cleveland, MyNetworkTV affiliate WBFS-TV in Miami, and independent station WMLW-TV in Milwaukee – in that case, tracing back to its pre-2013 existence as a low-power station – declined to carry it). It is unclear whether or not, since the infomercial buyers pay the network for national network reach on Weekend Marketplace, the Fox affiliates that refuse to carry the block have to compensate Fox and/or the infomercial buyers for the lack of broadcast coverage in that market. Sinclair- operated/Deerfield Media-owned KMYS in San Antonio, which switched from MyNetworkTV to The CW in September 2010, continues to carry the block in lieu of Fox-affiliated sister station KABB and instead airs The CW's brokered E/I block, One Magnificent Morning (programmed by Litton Entertainment), during overnight periods inaccessible to most children. Likewise, One Magnificent Morning's predecessor, Vortexx (programmed by Saban Brands, which acquired most of 4Kids's program library in 2012), was programmed in the same fashion prior to its discontinuance by The CW in September 2014 (KMYS already carries three hours of E/I programming purchased from syndication, allowing it to meet the regulations). In both instances, this is likely because the station was unable to revoke the deal to carry Weekend Marketplace.

The Orlando Sentinel, though noting \\"discomfort with some of Mr. Eisnaugle's positions,\\" endorsed him over Christian, praised him as an \\"engaging candidate\\" with \\"some good ideas.\\" In the end, Eisnaugle managed to defeat Christian by a slim margin to earn his first term in the legislature, receiving 52% of the vote to Christian's 48%. Running for re-election in 2010, Eisnaugle faced Christian once again, and Tea Party candidate Darin Dunmire; Eisnaugle once again received the endorsement of the Sentinel, which praised him as \\"one of the Legislature's more thoughtful workhorses,\\" and singled him out for bucking those in his party who wanted to abolish the State Department of Community Affairs. Once again, Eisnaugle defeated Christian, but this time by a more comfortable margin, receiving 60% of the vote to Christian's 36% and Dunmire's 4%. In 2012, following the reconfiguration of state legislative districts, Eisnaugle was moved into the 44th District, where fellow State Representative Steve Precourt was running for re-election to his fourth and final term. With the knowledge that Precourt would be unable to run again in 2014, Eisnaugle stepped aside, and began campaigning to run as Precourt's successor. = 2014-2017 = Following his departure from the legislature, Eisnaugle joined the law offices of Rumberger, Kirk and Caldwell, practicing commercial litigation and appellate law. With an eye on running for the legislature in the 44th District in 2014, Eisnaugle continued his fundraising and campaigning efforts, predicting that his \\"conservative message\\" about reducing the size of government and cutting taxes would resonate with the voters. In 2014, when Precourt resigned to accept a job with the Orlando–Orange County Expressway Authority, a special election was held and Eisnaugle ran to succeed him. In the Republican primary, he defeated former Orange County School Board Member Vicky Bell with 85% of the vote and advanced to the general election, where he faced Shaun Raja, a businessman and the Democratic nominee. Owing to the conservative nature of the district, Eisnaugle defeated Raja in a landslide, winning his return to the legislature with 74% of the vote. Even before he returned to the legislature, Eisnaugle donated tens of thousands of dollars to fellow Republicans running for the legislature, with the implicit aim of lining up supporters for his bid for the Speakership of the Florida House of Representatives for the 2020-2022 legislative session. Former Lieutenant Governor Toni Jennings criticized Eisnaugle's plan, noting that he was getting ahead of himself and declaring, \\"Talk about the tail wagging the dog. This tail is so far ahead of itself, it can't even see the dog anymore.\\" Eisnaugle won reelection to his seat in the 2014 elections, defeating Independent Matthew Falconer. He was subsequently re-elected unopposed in 2016.  Fifth District Court of Appeal  After Judge C. Alan Lawson was appointed by Governor Rick Scott to the Florida Supreme Court, Eisnaugle applied for Lawson's vacant seat on the Fifth District Court of Appeal. He was one of six finalists forwarded by the Judicial Nominating Commission to Scott, and on May 8, 2017, Scott appointed him to the court.

Plot Sent by the Humanx Commonwealth Science Council, a team of explorers manage to find the planet Quofum—which only occasionally appears on long range scans. Since the planet is outside of the Commonwealth territory their mission is deemed minor and unimportant. The team's four scientists—two human males, one human female and one male thranx—initially discover four separate, unique sentient species. Combined with Quofum's nine percent alcohol oceans, its unstable appearance is seemingly part of the nature of Quofum: every species on Quofum is seemingly unrelated—casting well-established scientific notions of evolution into doubt. When the team's mechanic, Salvador Araza murders the ship's captain—revealing himself to be a member of the assassin clan, the Qwarm—the scientific exploration nearly ends. Before stranding the scientists on Quofum, Araza kills one member of the team who tries to stop him from stealing the ship's shuttle. Upon returning to the ship Araza leaves Quofum but quickly discovers he is not in any part of the known universe. Unknowingly he left the planet while it was in an alternate universe where it periodically hides. Upon realizing his mistake, Araza tries to re-locate Quofum, but fails—stranding himself in the alternate universe. The three remaining scientists fall into a survivor's depression realizing their small expedition won't be missed while also lacking a means to return home on their own. They continue to explore and document Quofum's flora and fauna, documenting upwards of ten different sentient species of various degrees of technological development. Eventually they happen upon an entrance to the inner workings of the planet. The ancient race (unnamed, but obviously the Xunca) that once inhabited Quofum altered their planet when they realized the inter-galactic Great Evil was eventually coming to their corner of the universe. The main alternation was to give Quofum the ability to shift to a different universe to protect itself. They also started multiple experiments to create different diverse races in an attempt to find a species that could trigger the \\"Great Attractor device\\" they set up in the Norma cluster to fight the Great Evil. The solution to the problem, and the conclusion to the storyline is actually revealed in Flinx Transcendent. Continuity Although supposedly starting in 555 A.A. in the Commonwealth timeline, and before the events to be revealed in Flinx Transcendent, the actual amount of time spent by the scientists exploring inside Quofum is unclear. While implied that the trio spent years investigating the extent of Quofum's mysterious inner workings, this would seemingly contradict the established Commonwealth timeline.

Development The \\"Pegmantit 8\\" which is abbreviated to P-8 was a development of one of the first early warning and ground control radars to be developed by the former Soviet Union, the P-3 radar. The radar was developed and successfully tested between 1949 and 1950, demonstrating a detection range of 150 km against a target aircraft at 8 km altitude and was accepted into operational service. The P-8 was developed by the SKB Design Bureau, a division of State Plant No.197 named after V.I.Lenin who developed the previous P-3, the predecessor of the current Nizhniy Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT). The development of the P-8 radar won the team responsible for its introduction the state prize. In 1951 the P-8 radar underwent a significant modification which boosted the detection range to 250 km against a target flying at an altitude of 10 km, the target detection range of low altitude targets was also improved by a factor of 60-70%. Between 1956 and 1957 the P-10 and legacy P-8 radar were equipped with improved clutter suppression equipment allowing for cancellation of clutter moving up to 30 m/s, cancellation was improved by a factor of 5 compared with no cancellation. Description The P-8 being a development of the earlier P-3 shares many similarities with the earlier system, like the P-3M (mobile variant) the P-8 was mounted in two ZiL trucks. The P-8 used a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception which rotated at a speed of 2 r.p.m. The antenna was composed of four Yagi antennas mounted in sets of two with one set above the other atop a 30-meter mast. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the antenna with elevation determined using a goniometer in similar fashion to the P-3. The P-8 was one of the first Russian radars to incorporate a means of clutter suppression, a coherent oscillator in the receiver circuit acted as a simple moving target indicator to eliminate passive interference like ground clutter. The P-8 was also the first Russian radar to use a plan position indicator in addition to an A-scope to indicate height, the radar had a maximum power output of up to 75 kW and a receiver sensitivity of 7 mV. Operators The P-8 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1950 but has long since become obsolete and retired from service, replaced by more advanced models entering into service after the P-8 such as the P-10 radar.

The ateliers belonged to a Praça da Sé building named Palacete Santa Helena. This building was demolished in 1971, when the Sé station of São Paulo Metro was built. The Santa Helena Group was formed spontaneously, without any conceptual commitment. Most of its members were Italian immigrants, like Alfredo Volpi and Fulvio Pennacchi; sons of Italian immigrants, like Aldo Bonadei, Alfredo Rizzotti, Mario Zanini and Humberto Rosa; some were Spanish immigrants like Francisco Rebolo; some Portuguese immigrants like Manuel Martins. They all shared a humble origin, and worked as artisans or proletarians. Rebolo, Volpi and Zanini were wall painters. Clóvis Graciano was a railroad worker. Fulvio Pennacchi was a butcher. Aldo Bonadei worked with costume design and embroidery. Rizzotti was an auto mechanic and a lathe worker. Manoel Martins was a goldsmith. Rebolo was a football player. Humberto Rosa and Pennacchi taught drawing. Painting was for the weekends or leisure time. Most of them had courses in the Liceu de Artes e Ofícios (or \\"Arts and Crafts Lyceum\\", that was one Liceo scientifico), or the Escola Profissional Masculina do Brás (or \\"Men's Professional School of Brás\\"). However, they reduced what they learned to drawing and painting techniques, not to the academic guiding of formal order, were they aware of that or not. By this time, some painters associations were created in São Paulo, like the Sociedade Pró-Arte Moderna (or \\"Pro-Modern Art Society\\", aka SPAM) or Clube dos Artistas Modernos (CAM, or \\"Modern Artists Club\\"). They joined the participants of the Semana de Arte Moderna (or \\"Modern Art Week\\"). These groups were formed by intellectuals and members of the São Paulo elite, which kept a great distance from the Santa Helena members and other proletarian groups, about which they had little or no knowledge. The group union, that lasted for years, can be explained as a reaction against the enormous prejudice that existed about the poor immigrants, that came not only from the pre-existent Brazilian elite families, but also from immigrants that became wealthy in Brazil. That prejudice was made clear in several criticisms that were directed to the Group's work, particularly when it started to cause a sensation, and to threaten positions already established. Some Santa Helena artists had already studied art in Europe before arriving in Brazil; for instance Pennacchi, Rizzotti and Bonadei. All others had difficulty learning about the art created there, and could only be taught by teachers in Brazil. Bonadei was a student of Pedro Alexandrino, Antonio Rocco and Amadeo Scavone. Graciano was taught by Waldemar da Costa, and Zanini was a Georg Elpons student. The perseverance of the group, in its fight for survival, caused interest and attracted new friends and partners. So, in due time, the place became the meeting point of many other artists. The Santa Helena Group's major achievement was to reveal some of the most important Brazilian visual artists of the 20th century. Exhibitions In 1937, an exhibition named Família Artística Paulista, or \\"Artistic Family of São Paulo\\" shown a set of artists, including the Grupo Santa Helena, that could show their work publicly for the first time. From then on, the Grupo became known. They provoked the interest of Mário de Andrade, that identified in them a \\"São Paulo school of painting\\". In 1940, the \\"Exhibition of French Painters\\", that presented Cézanne, Picasso, Braque and Gris, among others, caused an enormous impact and several components of the group started to redirect his work, what made them more distant of the Grupo's themes or in their formal aspects.

The company built both road and mountain bike frames in steel and titanium and were the early builders of Greg LeMond road and mountain titanium frames, before LeMond production went to Litespeed and later Trek Bicycle Corporation. Clark-Kent sponsored the Coors-Light domestic professional cycling team which included well known road racer and olympic gold medalist Alexi Grewal, and also sponsored Colorado based elite junior cycling squad Horsetooth Racing Team in 1993, which included US Junior National Team members. The company employed master-welders Ivo Vinklarek and Don Herr, however welding on later frames was outsourced with some quality problems which contributed to the demise of the brand. Pat Clark was part owner of the famous Denver Spoke bicycle shop, and also owned a group of bicycle shops known as Premier Cycles across the greater Denver area.

The name derives from the Latin tellus, meaning Earth. Tellurometer Model M/RA-1 History The original tellurometer, known as the Micro-Distancer MRA 1, was introduced in 1957.Tellurometer MRA 1 It was invented by Trevor Wadley of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), also responsible for the Wadley Loop receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple crystals.Wadley Loop HF receivers Methodology The tellurometer emits a microwave-frequency radio wave: the remote station reradiates the incoming wave in a similar wave of more complex modulation, and the resulting phase shift is a measure of the distance travelled. The results appear on a cathode ray tube with circular sweep. The instrument penetrates haze and mist in daylight or darkness and has a normal range of 30–50 km but can extend up to 70 km.History of the Tellurometer Application Typical distance measurements were between mountain tops The tellurometer design yields high accuracy distance measurements over geodetic distances, but it is also useful for second order survey work, especially in areas where the terrain is rough and/or the temperatures extreme. Examples of remote locations mapped using Tellurometer surveys are Adams Bluff, Churchill Mountains, Cook Mountains, Jacobsen Glacier, Mount Albright, Mount Predoehl, Mount Summerson, Sherwin Peak and Vogt Peak. The MRB2 or Hydrodist was a marine version that was used in coastal surveys and calibrating ships using other survey navigation systems. They were used by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in the late 1960s. Commercial exploitation Plessey, the British electronics company, formed a new subsidiary known as Tellurometer (Pty) Limited in the 1960s to manufacture the product and to develop and sell derivatives. The Company subsequently introduced numerical displays, solid state transmitters, integrated circuits and eventually microprocessors for the product.

This came to the attention of Bob Ferguson and Chet Atkins of RCA Nashville. Felton Jarvis, Elvis Presley's producer, was enlisted to produce the album. In December 1965, Weesner and Jarvis persuaded RCA to record Clark on the sidewalk, complete with prominently featured (but overdubbed) street noises and interactions with city dwellers. Clark performed original songs and variations of familiar pop, country and blues songs, including the Everly Brothers' hit \\"Bye Bye Love\\", Blind Boy Fuller's \\"Truckin' My Blues Away\\", and \\"Walk Right In\\" as popularised by the Rooftop Singers. Despite the record selling fewer than 1,000 copies, Jarvis submitted it to the Recording Academy in the Folk category for 1966 record releases,Grammy Awards which it won (other nominees included Ravi Shankar; Peter, Paul and Mary; and Pete Seeger). However, the success had little impact on Clark, who continued to perform on the streets and was never recorded again. He died in 1969 in a house fire, after his kerosene heater exploded. Tributes In 1973 the singer-songwriter Mickey Newbury wrote and recorded a song, \\"Cortelia Clark\\", based on his knowledge of the real Clark, on the album Heaven Help the Child. A live version was issued on Newbury's 1988 album In a New Age. Newbury said, \\"In Nashville...there was an old man there I used to go in and listen to all the time...he was really a great old guy.... I was in San Francisco... I got back home, picked up all of newspapers and went inside, started reading through them. Found out he had burned to death in his trailer while I was gone. I don't know how much it will mean ever to him, but this is a song I wrote about him.\\" The song has subsequently been recorded by other artists, including the Kingston Trio and Josh White, Jr., who released an album of the same title in 2000.

With the start of Lord Roberts' offensive against the Boer Republics, Scobell saw his first action at the Battle of Paardeberg before participating in the relief of Kimberly. Following the battle of Paarderberg, Scobell's squadron captured a strategic hill east of Bloemfontein. With 65 men, Scobell rode 35 miles, forcing his way past the Boer commandos defending the rail line in order seize the heights. Through the night, Scobbel's men held the hill despite being outnumbered by Boer commandos. Scobell's squadron was left at Utival (also known as Zilikats Nek). There they were eventually joined by five companies from the 2nd battalion, the Lincolnshire Regiment, with a section of guns from O Battery, RHA.

In the midst of a six-day mission, Scobell received information that Lötter's commando was laagered near the town of Petersburg in a gorge called Groenkloof. Quickly acting on the new intelligence, Scobell's column surprised Lötter's commando at the Battle of Groenkloof on 5 September 1901. In exchange for 10 dead troopers, Scobell's column killed 13, wounded 46 and captured the rest of Lötter's command, effectively destroying one of the most successful Boer units operating in the Cape. In recognition of his success, Scobell was granted the brevet rank of colonel. For his service in the war, Scobell received the Queen's South Africa Medal (with six clasps), the King's South Africa Medal (with two clasps), and was mentioned in despatches several times (including by Lord Roberts on 31 March 1900, and by Lord Kitchener on 23 June 1902). = Post-war service = With the end of the war approaching, Scobell returned to London on board the steamer Plassy in February 1902, and was received in audience by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace the following May.

As the disease progresses, the oral mucosa becomes fibrotic to the point that the person is unable to open the mouth. The condition is remotely linked to oral cancers and is associated with areca nut and / or its by-products chewing, majorly practiced in South and South-East Asian countries. The incidence of OSMF has also increased in the western countries due to the changing habits and constant migrating population. Definitions Per Jens J Pindborg and Satyavati Sirsat (1966) (Pathological definition)- ‘An insidious chronic disease affecting any part of the oral cavity and sometimes the pharynx. Although occasionally preceded by and/or associated with vesicle formation, it is always associated with a juxta-epithelial inflammatory reaction followed by a fibro-elastic change of the lamina propria, with epithelial atrophy leading to stiffness.’ Per Mohit Sharma and Raghu Radhakrisnan (2019) - 'An insidious, chronic potentially malignant fibrotic disorder affecting the entire oral cavity and sometimes the pharynx and oesophagus. Although occasionally preceded by and/or associated with vesicle formation, it is always associated with a juxta-epithelial inflammatory reaction followed by a fibroelastic change of the lamina propria with epithelial atrophy leading to stiffness of the oral mucosa, progressive decrement in mouth opening and inability to eat' Per Chandramani More and Naman Rao (2019) (Clinical definition)- ‘A debilitating, progressive, irreversible collagen metabolic disorder induced by chronic chewing of areca nut and its commercial preparations; affecting the oral mucosa and occasionally the pharynx and esophagus; leading to mucosal stiffness and functional morbidity; and has a potential risk of malignant transformation.’ Epidemiology The incidence of the disease is higher in people from certain parts of the world including South and South East Asian, South Africa and the Middle Eastern countries. Symptoms In the initial phase of the disease, the mucosa feels leathery with palpable fibrotic bands. In the advanced stage the oral mucosa loses its resiliency and becomes blanched and stiff. The disease is believed to begin in the posterior part of the oral cavity and gradually spread outward. Other features of the disease include: *Xerostomia *Recurrent ulceration *Pain in the ear or deafness *Nasal intonation of voice *Restriction of the movement of the soft palate *A budlike shrunken uvula *Thinning and stiffening of the lips *Pigmentation of the oral mucosa *Dryness of the mouth and burning sensation (stomatopyrosis) *Decreased mouth opening and tongue protrusion Causes Dried products such as paan masala and gutkha have higher concentrations of areca nut and appear to cause the disease. Other causes include: *Immunological diseases *Extreme climatic conditions *Prolonged deficiency to iron and vitamins in the diet Pathogenesis \\"Exposure to areca nut (Arecacatechu) containing products with or without tobacco (ANCP/T) is currently believed to lead to OSF in individuals with genetic immunologic or nutritional predisposition to the disease. \\" This hypersensitivity reaction results in a juxta-epithelial inflammation that leads to increased fibroblastic activity and decreased breakdown of fibers. The fibroblasts are phenotypically modified, and the fibers they form are more stable, produce thicker bundles that progressively become less elastic. once the original loosely arranged fibrous tissue is replaced by the ongoing fibrosis, the movability of the oral tissues is reduced, there is loss of flexibility and reduced opening of the mouth. These collagen fibers are non degradable and the phagocytic activity is minimized. According to a recent cross sectional study the time taken for return of salivary pH to baseline levels after chewing areca nut containing mixtures is significantly longer in habitual users with OSF when compared to unaffected users. Sharma et al., have equated the pathogenesis of OSF to a over-healing wound, to explain its evolution as well as malignant transformation. DiagnosisClassification= Oral submucous fibrosis is clinically divided into three stages: *Stage 1: Stomatitis *Stage 2: Fibrosis **a- Early lesions, blanching of the oral mucosa **b- Older lesions, vertical and circular palpable fibrous bands in and around the mouth or lips, resulting in a mottled, marble-like appearance of the buccal mucosa *Stage 3: Sequelae of oral submucous fibrosis **a- Leukoplakia **b- Speech and hearing deficits Khanna and Andrade in 1995 developed a group classification system for the surgical management of trismus: *Group I: Earliest stage without mouth opening limitations with an interincisal distance of greater than 35 mm. *Group II: Patients with an interincisal distance of 26–35 mm. *Group III: Moderately advanced cases with an interincisal distance of 15–26 mm. Fibrotic bands are visible at the soft palate, and pterygomandibular raphe and anterior pillars of fauces are present. *Group IVA: Trismus is severe, with an interincisal distance of less than 15 mm and extensive fibrosis of all the oral mucosa. *Group IVB: Disease is most advanced, with premalignant and malignant changes throughout the mucosa.tumor necrosis factor alpha and keratin 17 are interdependent regulators, they could be used as diagnostic makers and a prognostic mirror of oral submucous fibrosis cases Treatment Biopsy screening although necessary is not mandatory most dentist can visually examine the area and proceed with the proper course of treatment. Treatment includes: *Abstention from chewing areca nut (also known as betel nut) and tobacco *Minimizing consumption of spicy foods, including chiles *Maintaining proper oral hygiene *Supplementing the diet with foods rich in vitamins A, B complex, and C and iron *Forgoing hot fluids like tea, coffee *Forgoing alcohol *Employing a dental surgeon to round off sharp teeth and extract third molars *Interprofessional treatment approach Treatment also includes following: *The prescription of chewable pellets of hydrocortisone (Efcorlin); one pellet to be chewed every three to four hours for three to four weeks *0.5 ml intralesional injection Hyaluronidase 1500 IU mixed in 1 ml of Lignocaine into each buccal mucosa once a week for 4 weeks or more as per condition *0.5 ml intralesional injection of Hyaluronidase 1500 IU and 0.5 ml of injection Hydrocortisone acetate 25 mg/ml in each buccal mucosa once a week alternatively for 4 weeks or more as per condition *Submucosal injections of hydrocortisone 100 mg once or twice daily depending upon the severity of the disease for two to three weeks *Submucosal injections of human chorionic gonadotrophins (Placentrax) 2-3 ml per sitting twice or thrice in a week for three to four weeks *Surgical treatment is recommended in cases of progressive fibrosis when interincisor distance becomes less than . (Multiple release incisions deep to mucosa, submucosa and fibrotic tissue and suturing the gap or dehiscence so created by mucosal graft obtained from tongue and Z-plasty. In this procedure multiple deep z-shaped incisions are made into fibrotic tissue and then sutured in a straighter fashion.) *Pentoxifylline (Trental), a methylxanthine derivative that has vasodilating properties and increases mucosal vascularity, is also recommended as an adjunct therapy in the routine management of oral submucous fibrosis. * IFN-gamma is antifibrotic cytokine which alters collagen synthesis and helps in OSF. *Colchicine tablets 0.5 mg twice a day *Lycopene, 16 mg a day helps in improvement of OSF The treatment of patients with oral submucous fibrosis depends on the degree of clinical involvement. If the disease is detected at a very early stage, cessation of the habit is sufficient. Most patients with oral submucous fibrosis present with moderate-to-severe disease. Severe oral submucous fibrosis is irreversible. Moderate oral submucous fibrosis is reversible with cessation of habit and mouth opening exercise. Current modern day medical treatments can make the mouth opening to normal minimum levels of 30 mm mouth opening with proper treatment. Research Recently scientists have proven that intralesional injection of autologous bone marrow stem cells is a safe and effective treatment modality in oral sub mucosal fibrosis. It has been shown autologous bone marrow stem cell injections induces angiogenesis in the area of lesion which in turn decreases the extent of fibrosis thereby leading to significant increase in mouth opening. History In 1952, T.Sheikh coined the term distrophica idiopathica mucosa oris to describe an oral fibrosing disease he discovered in five Indian women from Kenya. S.G. Joshi subsequently coined the termed oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) for the condition in 1953.

Bell, music by George Gershwin and lyrics by Ira Gershwin (writing under the pseudonym \\"Arthur Francis\\"). The script is based on Bell's 1918 play A Dislocated Honeymoon. The story concerns an ex-showgirl who elopes with a society boy, but his family tries to break up the marriage. The Gershwins wrote ten songs for the musical, eight of which were used in the production, which premiered in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on March 21, 1921. It toured through several cities and ended in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it closed on April 16, 1921. The show was George Gershwin's second book musical and his first full score written with his brother Ira. The book is believed to be lost.Pollack, p. 255 The show is one of the few Gershwin musicals that never made it to Broadway. The book was revised and retitled Elsie and, later, entirely new music was written for it by Eubie Blake and others. This version was produced on Broadway in April 1923. Even though Elsie ran for only 40 performances, it made history as a rare early example of black songwriters writing for white performers.Pollack, p. 257 No one knows why director Edgar MacGregor abandoned the Gershwin score. Several of the songs were later reused, and Ella Fitzgerald had a success in 1959 with her recording of \\"Boy Wanted\\".Pollack, p. 258 Plot Elsie Crofton, age eighteen, is a former chorus girl. She has given up the stage to elope with wealthy, spoiled, but good-hearted Harry Hammond, the son of a government contractor. Harry's parents, Phillip and Eleanor, his sister Margery and her fiancé Fred Blakely consider Elsie dangerous to their social position and oppose the marriage. They arrange for Harry to go to a family construction site, to interrupt the honeymoon, and send Elsie to stay at their summer home, where their family friends Alfie and Anne Westford are also staying. The family plans to destroy the marriage by placing Elsie in a compromising position with the willing and eager Fred. Anne also reveals her prejudices against Elsie. Elsie soon grasps the situation and decides to take action. She flirts with all the men, which dismays her visiting husband, but she gains the sympathies of Phillip, Fred and Alfie.

Development The \\"Pegmantit 10\\" which is abbreviated to P-10 was a development of the earlier P-8 radar, itself a development of one of the first early warning and ground control radars to be developed by the former Soviet Union, the P-3 radar. The P-10 radar was developed and successfully tested between 1951 and 1953, incorporating the achievements of the P-8 in addition to many new improvements and was accepted into operational service by the end of 1953. The P-10 was developed by the SKB Design Bureau, a division of State Plant No.197 named after V. I. Lenin and the predecessor of the current Nizhniy Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT), which developed the previous P-8. Between 1956 and 1957 the P-10 and legacy P-8 radar were equipped with improved clutter suppression equipment allowing for cancellation of clutter moving up to 30 m/s, cancellation was improved by a factor of 5 compared with no cancellation. Description The P-10 shares many similarities with the earlier P-8; the P-10 was also mounted in two ZiL trucks. The P-10 used a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, the antenna was composed of four Yagi antennas mounted in sets of two with one set above the other. The antenna mast was mounted directly to the Zil transport truck, previous radar like the P-8 had a free standing mast, the advantage of the P-10 mast was that it could be deployed and stowed much faster than before, improving the mobility of the radar. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the antenna with elevation determined using a Goniometer in similar fashion to the original P-3. The P-10 used a plan position indicator in addition to an A-scope to indicate height, the radar had a maximum power output of up to 100 kW and a pulse width of 4-12 microseconds. A secondary radar for IFF was generally used in conjunction with the P-8 such as the NRS-12 (NATO \\"Score Board\\"). In addition to incorporating a means of passive clutter suppression the P-10 was also able to alter its carrier frequency to improve resistance to both passive clutter and active jamming techniques. Operators The P-10 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1953 but has long since become obsolete and retired from service, replaced by more advanced models entering into service after the P-10 such as the P-12 radar.

It was co-produced by Rev. James K. Friedrich and released by Cathedral Films in 1939. Its theatrical release was in 1941 by Twentieth Century Fox. Releasing information from the Internet Movie Database Plot The film takes place in 30 A.D. Judea in a fictional village near Jerusalem. The protagonist is Joel, the elder son of the village rabbi Lamech. Lamech wants Joel to follow in his footsteps as a scribe and rabbi, but Joel is secretly a zealot leader, believing that more must be done to help his nation than studying the Scriptures. He is also secretly in love with Tamar, the daughter of the carpet merchant Jemuel, and he overhears his father and Jemuel arranging a marriage between Tamar and one of Lamech's sons. Unfortunately for Joel it turns out to be his younger brother Zadok, an impetuous zealot, whom Joel has to protect from his own recklessness. A crisis is brought about by the arrival of a troop of soldiers led by a centurion, Longinus, who issues the demand for a special tax to be collected by a tax collector traveling with them. Zadok and other zealots organize the release of prisoners taken by the soldiers, which moves Longinus to plan a massacre of the men of the village. Zadok wants to attack the Romans right away, but Joel feels that a larger resistance is needed through someone reputed to be the coming Messiah of the Jewish people, Jesus Christ. Joel runs afoul of his father in declaring his love for Tamar, whom his father wants wedded to Zadok, and in revealing that he is a zealot leader. With the sword of the zealots entrusted to him, Joel goes out to find Jesus in order to enlist His leadership of their cause. [Jesus is not presented directly in this film, but only as a reflection in water, as the glow of light on His listeners, and by way of the voice of Irving Pichel, the director.] Joel meets Jesus' disciples, Andrew and Judas Iscariot, who have two different ideas about Jesus' mission. Judas, like the zealots, thinks that Jesus should be a military and political leader who would lead his people against the Romans. Joel confronts Jesus with the sword of the zealots, and Jesus declines his invitation with the words of Matthew 26:52 \\"all who take up the sword will perish by the sword.\\" Joel disappointedly returns to his village just in time for the wedding feast of his brother Zadok and his beloved Tamar. He comes up with the idea that he and the zealots would kidnap Jesus and force His hand to support them. This is forestalled by Jesus' appearance at the village gate where Joel's father is presented as the scribe who asks Jesus, \\"What is the greatest commandment in the Law? (Luke 10:25-37). Jesus replies with His Parable of the Good Samaritan. Jesus' exhortation at the end to, \\"Go and do thou likewise\\", moves Joel to abandon his plan to kidnap Jesus. Zadok is told by Nathan the innkeeper that Longinus is vulnerably asleep at his inn, and he gives up going to his bridal bed in order to kill Longinus. Nathan calls Joel and Lamech to the inn because Longinus repulsed Zadok's attack by killing him. The effect of Jesus' words on Joel moves him to keep from killing the unconscious Longinus and standing as a buffer between him and the men of the village, who are thirsting for his blood. When they ask Joel why he is protecting Longinus, he replies that he too is his brother. Longinus sends word for his soldiers to meet him at the inn, and he has the soldiers arrest Joel and take him to prison in Jerusalem. In prison Joel misses the Passion of Jesus. Tamar is allowed to visit him. They are met by Longinus, who tells Joel that he had him arrested for his own protection from the village mob. He tells him of another wonder: he was a witness of Jesus' crucifixion, and he was the soldier who thrust the spear in His side to make sure He was dead. Longinus throws down the spear, and he, Joel, and Tamar return to the village to witness their Christian faith.

The conflict resulted in between 1,166 and 1,417 Palestinian and 13 Israeli deaths (4 from friendly fire).Al-Mughrabi, Nidal. Israel tightens grip on urban parts of Gaza The Israeli government's stated goal was to stop indiscriminate Palestinian rocket fire into Israel\\"Q&A;: Gaza conflict\\", BBC 18-01-2009 and weapons smuggling into the Gaza strip.Bright, Arthur. \\"Israel set to launch 'limited operation' in Gaza\\", The Christian Science Monitor, 26 December 2008. Hamas stated its rocket fire, which resumed in November 2008, was in response to an Israeli raid of a tunnel leading from Gaza, which it characterized as a ceasefire violation. Israel said the raid was a preemptive strike against a tunnel they believed would be used to abduct Israeli soldiers guarding the border. In the initial air assault, Israeli forces attacked police stations, military targets including weapons caches and suspected rocket firing teams, as well as political and administrative institutions in the opening assault, striking in the densely populated cities of Gaza, Khan Yunis and Rafah. After hostilities broke out, Palestinian groups fired rockets in response to what they characterized as \\"massacres\\". The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets as illegal under international law. An Israeli ground invasion began on 3 January. On 5 January, the IDF began operating in the densely populated urban centers of Gaza. During the last week of the offensive (from 12 January), Israel mostly hit targets it had damaged before and struck Palestinian rocket- launching units. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against mostly civilian targets in southern Israel, reaching the major cities of Beersheba and Ashdod for the first time during the conflict.\\"Rockets land east of Ashdod\\" Ynetnews, 28 December 2008; \\"Rockets reach Beersheba, cause damage\\", Ynetnews, 30 December 2008. Israeli politicians ultimately decided against striking deeper within Gaza amid concerns of higher casualties on both sides and rising international criticism. The conflict ended on 18 January, when the IDF first declared a unilateral ceasefire, followed by Hamas' announcing a one-week ceasefire twelve hours later. The IDF completed its withdrawal on 21 January.\\"Hamas, Israel set independent cease-fires\\", CNN International; Last Israeli troops 'leave Gaza', BBC News, 21 January 2009. According to the Shin Bet, after the conflict, there was a decrease in Palestinian rocket attacks.Israeli Security Agency 2010 \\"Annual Summary – Data and Trends in Terrorism\\", Shin Bet In September 2009, a UN special mission, headed by the South African Justice Richard Goldstone, produced a report accusing both Palestinian militants and the IDF of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, and recommended bringing those responsible to justice.\\"UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza\\", BBC News, 15 September 2009. In January 2010, the Israeli government released a response criticizing the Goldstone Report and disputing its findings.\\"Gaza Operation Investigation: An Update\\", Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, January 2010. In 2011, Goldstone wrote that he no longer believed that Israel intentionally targeted civilians in Gaza. The other authors of the report, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin, and Desmond Travers, rejected Goldstone's re-assessment. The United Nations Human Rights Council ordered Israel to conduct various repairs of the damages. On 21 September 2012, the United Nations Human Rights Council concluded that 75% of civilian homes destroyed in the attack were not rebuilt. Background The Gaza Strip is a coastal strip of land on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea bordering Egypt and Israel. Following the death of Yassar Arafat in November 2004, his successor to the Palestinian Authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon signed a ceasefire agreement on 8 February 2005, essentially bringing an end to the Second Intifada. On 17 March 2005 the 13 main Palestinian factions including Hamas and Islamic Jihad agreed to be bound by the February agreement, conditional on cessation of Israeli attacks. Israel maintains that its occupation of Gaza ended following the completion of its unilateral disengagement plan in September 2005. Because in the post-disengagement period (after 2005) Israel has continued to control and occupy Gaza's airspace and territorial waters, and continues to restrict or prohibit the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza and to unilaterally dictate what Gazans may do in a border strip of variable and undefined width in their own territory, the UN, the International Criminal Court Human Rights Watch, and many other NGOs consider Israel still to be the occupying power.\\"Human Rights Council Special Session on the Occupied Palestinian Territories\\" 6 July 2006; Human Rights Watch considers Gaza still occupied. Hamas refrained from firing rockets toward Israel for 14 months in accordance with the February ceasefire agreement, until IDF naval shelling hit a Gaza beach, killing seven civilians, on 10 June 2006. Israel and the Quartet failed to anticipate Hamas's electoral victory in the January 2006 legislative elections, which the U.S. had pushed for. The victory permitted the formation of a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority government in March 2006. The Quartet (the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union) conditioned future foreign assistance to the Hamas-led PA on the future government's commitment to nonviolence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements. Hamas rejected the demands, calling the conditions unfair and endangering the well-being of Palestinians, leading to Quartet suspension of its foreign assistance program and to Israel imposing economic sanctions.

Rose’s view supported by NYTs reportage states that Hamas’s takeover was preemptive of a coup.'

Palestinian groups were partially able to bypass the blockade through tunnels, some of which are said to have been used for weapons smuggling.

After a three-and-a-half- year legal battle waged by the Gisha human rights organization, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) finally released a 2008 document that detailed its \\"red lines\\" for \\"food consumption in the Gaza Strip,\\" in which a calculation was made of the number of calories needed to be provided to Gaza by external sources to avoid malnutrition. COGAT said that the document was a draft, and never discussed nor implemented.

Gisha, an Israeli advocacy group, described the blockade as tantamount to \\"economic warfare\\" and collective punishment against the 1-5 million residents of Gaza. Israeli documents reveal that during that period its military \\"made precise calculations of Gaza’s caloric needs to avoid malnutrition\\", and sought to \\"keep Gaza’s economy on the brink of collapse\\". For the Israeli army, the purpose of the blockade was to weaken Hamas, its archenemy.

During the same period, Israel fired more than 14,600 155 mm artillery shells into the Gaza Strip, killing 59 Palestinians and injuring 270.

The lull agreed to was thought necessary to allow time for the IDF to prepare its operation.Norman Finkelstein Gaza: An Inquest into Its Martyrdom, University of California Press, 2018 p.35 The agreement required Hamas to end rocket and mortar attacks on Israel, while that country would cease attacks on and military incursions into Gaza, plus progressively ease the blockade of Gaza over a thirteen-day period. Points on which there was not mutual agreement included an end to Hamas' military buildup in Gaza and movement toward the release of Corporal Shalit. Hamas called on all of Gaza's militant groups to abide by the truce, and was confident they would do so.\\"Israel confirms Hamas ceasefire deal\\", The Independent, 18 June 2008Israel and Hamas 'agree truce' BBC News 18 June 2008 'A Hamas official said he was confident all militant groups in Gaza would abide by the agreement, brokered by Egypt'.

Richard Boudreaux, Israel and Hamas OK Gaza truce Los Angeles Times June 18, 2008 :’As details of the accord were being worked out, Israeli aircraft attacked targets in southern Gaza, killing six militants in a car. Gaza militants then fired four mortar shells at Israel, but no one was hurt.Hamas officials said the violence would not prevent the truce from taking effect’.’ They said all militant groups in Gaza had had promised to abide by it Defense Ministry Official Amos Gilad, the Israeli envoy to the talks, stressed that Israel demanded a ceasefire, meaning that even one single rocket fired will be seen as a violation of the agreement. He added that Egypt, on its side, was committed to preventing the smuggling activity from Gaza.\\"Top Defense Ministry official: If Shalit is not released, Rafah stays closed\\", Ynetnews, 16 June 2008 Gilad also said that Israel would hold Hamas responsible for attacks from Gaza. In a British Foreign Affairs Committee investigation, Dr Albasoos said that \\"Unfortunately, on 4 November 2008, the Israeli army killed six Palestinians. I was leaving the Gaza Strip to come to the UK that same night. I remember when the Israeli army invaded the middle area of the Gaza Strip, killing six Palestinians. It was outrageous from their side to come and breach that ceasefire. I believe that Palestinian political factions, including Hamas, committed to that ceasefire and still have the intention to renew it in the near future, as soon as possible.\\" In rebuttal, Ms Bar-Yaacov said that \\"The Israelis had added a condition to the tahdia (truce), being concerned that Hamas was building tunnels to go under the Israeli border and kidnap more Israeli soldiers. The condition stated that if Hamas came within 500 metres of the border, they (the IDF) would attack and that is exactly what happened (on 4 November 2008).\\" British barrister and professor Geoffrey Nice, and General Nick Parker, opined during a lecture that \\"Building a tunnel was not a breach of the ceasefire but the armed incursion into Gaza definitely was.\\". Implementation Pre-5 November 2008: \\"The ceasefire has brought enormous improvements in the quality of life in Sderot and other Israeli villages near Gaza, where before the ceasefire residents lived in fear of the next Palestinian rocket strike. However, nearby in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli blockade remains in place and the population has so far seen few dividends from the ceasefire.\\" Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire. Despite Israel's refusal to comply significantly with the truce agreement to end the siege/blockade, Hamas brought rocket and mortar fire from Gaza to a virtual halt during the summer and fall of 2008. Hamas \\"tried to enforce the terms of the arrangement\\" on other Palestinian groups, taking \\"a number of steps against networks which violated the arrangement,\\" including short-term detention and confiscating their weapons, but it could not completely end the rocket and mortar shell attacks by these rogue factions in Gaza. Hamas had sought support in Gazan public opinion for its policy of maintaining the ceasefire. On 2 August there were massive clashes in Gaza City after Hamas had stepped up its campaign to curb Fatah from attacking Israel The truce started uneasily with the UN recording seven IDF violations of the ceasefire between 20 and 26 June. On various occasions Israeli forces shot at farmers, wood collectors and fishermen in Gaza territory, seriously injuring two farmers. Subsequently, between 23 and 26 June, nine Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in three separate violations by Palestinian groups not affiliated with Hamas. No Israelis were injured.\\"Qassam lands in Sderot backyard\\", Ynetnews, 24 June 2008\\"Mortar shells land near southern kibbutz\\", Ynetnews, 27 June 2008\\"Palestinians fire mortars at Karni crossing\\", Ynetnetws, 29 June 2008 Islamic Jihad reportedly fired the rockets in retaliation for Israeli assassinations of their members in the West Bank. According to sources close to the ceasefire negotiations, after 72 hours from the start of the ceasefire, the crossing points would be opened to allow 30 per cent more goods to enter the Gaza strip. Ten days after that (i.e. thirteen days after the ceasefire began), all crossings would be open between Gaza and Israel, and Israel will allow the transfer of all goods that were banned or restricted to go into Gaza. Therefore, besides firing on and killing Gaza citizens, Israel failed further to comply with these truce obligations to ease the blockade that were crucial to all groups in Gaza. Islamic Jihad put pressure on Hamas to press Israel to comply with this vital part of the truce. The Carter Center recorded, based on U.N. OCHAO data, that instead of easing the blockade according to the agreed schedule, \\"... despite the 97% drop in attacks, the truce did not do much to ease the siege of Gaza. Imports increased only marginally ... only 27% of the amount of goods entering in January 2007\\" were allowed through at best. No exports were allowed. After the June 2008 ceasefire, the number of Palestinians entering and exiting Gaza at the Rafah crossing with Egypt increased slightly, with 108 people leaving in August 2008, but this number decreased soon after to only one in October 2008. The passage of Gazans through the Erez crossing reveal similar low numbers. Historian Ian Bickerton argues that Israel's failure to comply with the terms of the truce made conditions harder in Gaza.'In June 2008, Egypt brokered a six-month ceasefire. Israel increased the severity of its blockade of Gaza during the ceasefire, drastically restricting the entry of supplies necessary for daily living and preventing exports from leaving the Strip. The exchange of rockets launched and retaliatory aerial assaults increased late in 2008 with Hamas and Israel blaming each other for a breakdown in the ceasefire. The evidence suggests Israel broke the ceasefire with a raid into the Gaza Strip that killed six Hamas men on 4 November – the night of the presidential election in the USA.'Ian Bickerton The Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Guide for the Perplexed, A&C; Black 2012 p 238. Even though not part of the generally accepted truce terms, by 23 June 2006 Hamas and Israel began talks, via an Egyptian intermediary, regarding the release of the captured IDF soldier, Shalit. \\"As of 15 August, the UN reported that Israel was allowing a few new items into Gaza (including limited supplies of cement, clothes, juices, and agricultural materials) but said that overall humanitarian conditions had not significantly improved since the cease-fire began\\". After a few weeks of calm, clashes resumed. On 12 September the IDF shot and seriously wounded an unarmed Palestinian who strayed close to the border. A retaliatory rocket was fired. On 16 September IDF troops entered central Gaza to bulldoze land along the border fence. On 23 September, the UN reported, “Although the cease-fire has afforded the populations in southern Israel and Gaza greater security, there has been no corresponding improvement in living conditions for the population in Gaza. After the initial increase of goods allowed into Gaza to 30% of the 2007 levels, OCHAO data shows that the through-flow then fell rapidly through the September–October lull in rocket fire to below even pre-June levels. Notwithstanding Hamas not having fired a single rocket during the truce prior to 5 November 2008, Israel accused Hamas of bad faith and of violations of the Egyptian-mediated truce. Even though neither was included as Hamas obligations under the generally accepted terms of this truce, Israel noted that rocket fire from Gaza never stopped entirely (\\"between June 19 and November 4, 20 rockets,(three of which fell inside the Gaza Strip) and 18 mortar shells(five of which fell inside the Gaza Strip) were fired at Israel\\") and that weapons smuggling was not halted, Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of non-compliance with the truce by never allowing the major renewal of goods' flow into Gaza and of conducting raids that killed Hamas fighters.\\"Gaza truce broken as Israeli raid kills six Hamas gunmen\\", The Guardian, Rory McCarthy, 5 November 2008 During October 2008 Israel-Palestinian violence fell to its lowest level since the start of the al-Aqsa intifada in September 2000. One rocket and 1 mortar shell were fired at Israel in October. However, during the same period several Israeli violations were reported: In South Gaza on 3 October the IDF fired on two unarmed Palestinians near the border and sent soldiers into the strip to arrest them and detain them in Israel. On 19 October IDF bulldozers entered Gaza. On 27 October IDF soldiers fired into Gaza for unknown reasons damaging a school in Khuza'a and injuring one child. Palestinian fishing boats off the Gaza coast were fired upon on four separate occasions during the month wounding two fishermen, one of them seriously. According to Mondoweiss, for the entire duration of the 2008 Hamas–Israel cease-fire - even after the Israeli raid of a Hamas tunnel on 4 November - not a single person was killed by rocket or mortar fire into Israel. Pre-operation actions4 November IDF cross-border raid= On 4 November 2008, Israel launched a cross-border military raid (variously also referred to as an attack / invasion / incident / military event / incursion) code named Operation Double Challenge into a residential area of Dayr al-Balah in central Gaza to destroy the opening of a cross-border tunnel concealed within a building 300 meters from the fence on the Gaza Strip border. Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice QC and General Sir Nick Parker observed that \\"Building a tunnel was not a breach of the ceasefire but the (IDF) armed incursion into Gaza definitely was.\\" Various outlets and authors reported this Israeli action as breaking the June truce.\\"The Six Months of the Lull Arrangement\\", Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center December 2008: 'A period of relative quiet between 19 June and 4 November: As of 19 June, there was a marked reduction in the extent of attacks on the western Negev population. The lull was sporadically violated by rocket and mortar shell fire, carried out by rogue terrorist organizations, in some instances in defiance of Hamas (especially by Fatah and Al-Qaeda supporters). Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire.... The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement, 4 November to the time of this writing, December 172: On 4 November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas, which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose. Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action. In retaliation, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets.... During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm: Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks (rocket and mortar shell fire, IEDs and light-arms fire), the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip (Israeli Air Force attacks, firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border), the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire, in response to which Israel closed the border crossings, exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents.... With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on 4 November, Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods. That led to shortages of basic goods in the Gaza Strip and to disruptions in the supply of various types of fuel (although electrical power was not cut off, since the plant in Ashqelon, which supplies 65% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, provided an uninterrupted flow of power).' According to the Telegraph, writing as Cast Lead began, the 4 November operation \\"sealed the fate of the ceasefire.\\" Author Avi Shlaim wrote in 2015 that the \\"...ceasefire had a dramatic effect in de-escalating the conflict.....It was Israel that violated the ceasefire. On 4 November, 2008 the (IDF) launched a raid into Gaza and killed 6 Hamas fighters. That was the end of the ceasefire.\\" and that Hamas had set a \\"good example\\" in respecting the ceasefire. The raid, according to Mark LeVine was unprovoked.Mark LeVine, \\"Who will save Israel from itself?\\", Al Jazeera 27 December 2009 Israel stated its aim was to destroy what it said was a tunnel on the Gaza-Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers. While accusing Hamas of plotting to dig a tunnel under the border, Israeli defense official was quoted in The Washington Times as separately acknowledging that Israel wanted to \\"send Hamas a message\\". According to Israel, the raid was not a violation of the ceasefire, but a legitimate step to remove an immediate threat. The 2009 Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict noted that \\"the ceasefire began to founder on 4 November 2008 following an incursion by Israeli soldiers into the Gaza Strip\\". Tunnel threat Dr. Eado Heart, an Israeli defence analyst specialising in underground warfare, defined three types of Gaza tunnels, namely those intended for 'smuggling' from Egypt, those which are 'defensive' in nature designed for storage and protection, and those that are 'offensive' permitting cross-border penetrations into Israel by Gaza militants. \\"Once you find the entrance, you have to climb inside to know whether it is a defensive or offensive tunnel\\". Defensive tunnels have served as an 'escape hatch' for senior Hamas officials during Israeli invasions. \\"The purpose of the defensive tunnels is to enable the Hamas command structure to reside safely underground while their armed forces conduct a mobile defence against Israeli forces. Robert Pastor, who was intimately involved in the indirect 2008 Hamas-Israel negotiations, stated \\"There is some dispute as to whether that tunnel was intended to capture an Israeli soldier or whether it was a defensive tunnel to protect against an Israeli incursion. Later, once a new ceasefire had been negotiated, Pastor was quoted as saying that \\"Hamas officials asserted, however, that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel\\" and furthermore that an IDF official had confirmed that fact to him. The IDF allegation that the 'tunnel' attacked by it on 4 November 2008 was 'offensive', aimed at abducting IDF soldiers and posing an imminent threat, was also reported with doubt by various other players and commentators, such as UNISPAL that wrote \\"IDF special forces had entered the area to blow up a tunnel dug by Hamas for allegedly kidnapping IDF soldiers.\\" Another example is the Israeli daily Ha'aretz that wrote \\"(The tunnel was) dug ostensibly to facilitate the abduction of Israeli soldiers, (but the tunnel) was not a clear and present danger\\". Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter wrote, \\"Israel launched an attack in Gaza to destroy a defensive tunnel being dug by Hamas inside the wall that encloses Gaza.\\" The Journal of Palestine Studies favourably referenced Norman Finkelstein: \\"Israel broke the cease-fire by killing seven Palestinian militants, on the flimsy excuse that Hamas was digging a tunnel to abduct Israeli soldiers, and knowing full well that its operation would provoke Hamas into hitting back.\\" Noam Chomsky observed: \\"The pretext for the raid was that Israel had detected a tunnel in Gaza that might have been intended for use to capture another Israeli soldier; a 'ticking tunnel' in official communiques. The pretext was transparently absurd, as a number of commentators noted. If such a tunnel existed, and reached the border, Israel could easily have barred it right there.\\" Raid A paratroopers reconnaissance battalion commanded by Yaron Finkelman, supported by tanks and bulldozers crossed the border and penetrated about 250 meters into the Gaza Strip to destroy the tunnel.Yiftah S. Shapir and Gal Perl Finkel, Subterranean Warfare: A New-Old Challenge, a chapter inside \\"The Lessons of Operation Protective Edge\\", eds. Anat Kurz and Shlomo Brom, INSS, 2014. A firefight broke out, in which one Hamas fighter was killed. Hamas responded with a barrage of mortar and rocket fire at Israeli troops. Three Israeli airstrikes on Hamas mortar and rocket positions then killed five Hamas fighters. According to eyewitnesses, another three Hamas fighters were wounded in an Israeli UCAV strike over the el-Burejj refugee camp. Three Israeli soldiers were also wounded during the operation. Hamas said it would take revenge for what it perceived as an act of Israeli aggression that had violated the truce.\\"Rockets fired after Gaza clashes\\", BBC, 5 November 2009 Hamas launched 35 rockets into southern Israel in what was described by Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum as a \\"response to Israel's massive breach of the truce\\", stating that \\"The Israelis began this tension and they must pay an expensive price. They cannot leave us drowning in blood while they sleep soundly in their beds.\\" The blockade of Gaza was tightened further the following day. Immediate repercussions The intensity of rocket attacks targeted at Israeli cities near Gaza sharply increased after the 4 November 2008 cross-border IDF attack, approaching pre-truce levels. Clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants also took place along the border, during which 11 Palestinian militants were killed. According to CAMERA, in the period between 4 November incident and mid-December, more than 200 Qassam rockets and mortar shells landed in the western Negev region, most fired immediately after the 4 November tunnel raid by the IDF, and thereafter decreasing to a \\"few per day\\". Israel had frequently shut down the crossings in response to rocket attacks on its towns. =December repercussions= On 13 December, Israel announced that it favored extending the cease-fire, provided Hamas adhered to the conditions. On 14 December, a Hamas delegation in Cairo proposed that Hamas was prepared to stop all rocket attacks against Israel if the Israelis would open up the Gaza border crossings and pledge not to launch attacks in Gaza,\\"Israel Rejected Hamas Ceasefire Offer in December\\", IPS, 9 January 2009 as per the original June 2008 truce terms, to that date not complied with by Israel. On the same day, Hamas officials said that earlier reports, quoting Khaled Meshaal as saying there would be no renewal of the truce, were inaccurate. A Hamas spokesman said that the lull would not be renewed, \\"as long as there is no real Israeli commitment to all of its conditions\\".\\"Gaza-Israel truce in jeopardy\\", Al Jazeera, 15 December 2009 A spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister replied that Israel was committed to the truce but \\"it's clear there can't be a one-sided ceasefire, ... where rockets are everyday coming from the Gaza Strip targeting Israeli civilians.\\" On 17 December, a 40-year-old Palestinian was killed by IDF fire in Northern Gaza. The following day, 18 December, Hamas declared the end of the cease- fire, a day before the truce officially expired.\\"TIMELINE – Israeli-Hamas violence since truce ended\\", Reuters, 5 January 2009 More than 20 rockets were fired from Gaza into southern Israel on that day.\\"Hamas says it will not renew ceasefire\\" The Times 19 December 2008 On 19 December, Hamas refused to enter talks to renew the six-month truce and a Hamas spokesman announced that it would not extend the cease-fire. The spokesman, Ayman Taha, specified that Hamas's refusal was \\"because the enemy did not abide by its obligations\\" to ease a crippling blockade of the Gaza Strip, and had not halted all attacks. Palestinian sources said that Hamas wanted to renew the truce, but only on improved terms – a complete opening of the border crossings with Israel, the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a complete ban on Israeli military activity in Gaza and an extension of the truce to the West Bank as well. Israel was not ready to accept these terms. This was confirmed by Yuval Diskin, head of Shin Bet (Israel's internal security agency), at an Israeli cabinet meeting on 21 December. Diskin said he thought Hamas was \\"interested in continuing the truce, but wants to improve its terms ... it wants us to lift the siege of Gaza, stop attacks, and extend the truce to include the West Bank\\". Three Qassam rockets fired from the northern Gaza Strip landed in Israel.\\"Lull ends: 3 Qassams hit western Negev\\", Ynetnews, 19 December 2008 On 22 December, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said that his country will not accept the ongoing rocket fire from the Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, who had supported the truce until recently, suggested that military actions be taken against the Hamas government in Gaza. On 23 December, senior Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar said that Hamas was willing to renew the cease-fire under the original terms, demanding an Israeli commitment to refrain from any military operation in the Strip and to keep the border crossings open. Speaking with Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram, al-Zahar said that the movement would reassess the situation in Gaza once the 24 hours during which Hamas vowed to halt rocket fire had ended. Despite the temporary ceasefire declared by the armed Palestinian factions, eight Qassam rockets and eight mortar shells hit the Negev.\\"6 Qassams explode in western Negev\\", Ynetnews, 23 December 2008\\"2 Qassams, 8 mortar shells fired at Negev overnight\\" Ynetnews, 24 December 2008 Also that day, Israeli Defense Forces killed three Palestinian militants, stating they were planting explosives on the border. On 24 December, an Israeli airstrike hit a group of militants in the Gaza Strip. An Israeli military spokesman said that the militants had fired mortars at Israel. Palestinian medics said that one Hamas militant was killed in the strike and two other Palestinians were wounded, including a cameraman from Hamas' television station. On that day, Hamas military wing issued a statement saying that it began an operation code-named \\"Operation Oil Stain\\". 87 Palestinian mortar shells, Katyusha and Qassam rockets hit the Negev. Hamas said that it would expand the \\"Oil Stain\\" and put thousands of Israelis \\"under fire\\". Hamas said it was ready for the war: \\"far greater than surrendering to Israeli threats and that they became much more prepared to counter Israeli aggression and to defend themselves than in the past.\\" On 25 December, after Israel had \\"wrapped up preparations for a broad offensive\\", Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert delivered a final warning in an interview with the Arabic language satellite channel al-Arabiya. He said \\"I am telling them now, it may be the last minute, I'm telling them stop it. We are stronger.\\" Another 6 Qassams landed in southern Israel.\\"6 Qassams land in southern Israel\\", Ynetnews, 25 December 2008 ProceedingIsraeli offensive= Israel began planning for a military operation as early as six months before the conflict by collecting intelligence on potential targets. The IDF also engaged in a disinformation campaign to give Hamas a false sense of security and to take them by surprise. Defense minister Ehud Barak stated that the offensive was the result of Israel's \\"patience running out\\" over the rocket attacks, which had been restarted by Hamas after Israel destroyed a tunnel on 4 November. According to Israeli officials, its subsequent 27 December offensive took Hamas by surprise, thereby increasing militant casualties. Air strikes 107th Squadron preparing for takeoff At 11:30 am on 27 December 2008, Israel launched the campaign titled Operation Cast Lead. It began with an opening wave of airstrikes in which F-16 fighter jets and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters simultaneously struck 100 preplanned targets within a span of 220 seconds. There was a 95% success rate with zero misses in the opening attack according to the Israeli Air Force. Thirty minutes later, a second wave of 64 jets and helicopters struck at an additional 60 targets. The air strikes hit Hamas headquarters, government offices and 24 police stations. An Israeli UAV airstrike on the police headquarters of Gaza City killed 40 people, including several dozen police cadets at their graduation ceremony. Approximately 140 members of Hamas were killed, including Tawfik Jaber, head of Hamas' police force. Another estimate puts the death toll of the police academy strike at 225 Hamas militants killed and 750 injured.Efraim Inbar & Eitan Shamir, ‘Mowing the Grass’: Israel’s Strategy for Protracted Intractable Conflict, Journal of Strategic Studies, 37:1, 65-90 p.83.p.67 Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni told reporters that Israel would strike all targets associated with what she called the \\"illegitimate, terrorist government of Hamas\\". At least 225–230 Palestinians were killed and more than 700 injured on the first day of air strikes. Civilians, including children, were among the casualties. Although media reported that most of the dead were \\"Hamas security forces\\" or \\"Hamas operatives\\", police officers are, according to B'Tselem, presumed to be civilians and likely not legitimate objects of attack under international humanitarian law.B'Tselem, \\"Explanation of statistics on fatalities\\" . Human rights groups critically note that the attacks began around the time children were leaving school. The Israeli attack was the deadliest one-day death toll in 60 years of conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians, a day that was called the \\"Massacre of Black Saturday\\" by Palestinians in Gaza.\\"At least 205 killed as Israeli pounds Gaza\\", Alarabiya, 27 December 2008\\"Israeli jets kill 'at least 225' in strikes on Gaza\\" The Times 2008-12-28 Hamas responded with a rocket barrage on Southern Israel, and Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip kept Southern Israel under constant rocket fire during the entire war. Beersheba suffered two rocket attacks, the farthest Palestinian rockets had ever reached. Palestinian rocket fire killed three Israeli civilians and one soldier in the early days of the conflict. In the weeks following the initial air raids F-16Is and AH-64 Apaches continued to target Hamas facilities while also inflicting severe damage to Palestinian infrastructure. Israel used the 2000-pound Mark 84 Joint Direct Attack Munition to attack buildings and tunnels along the Gaza-Sinai border. The 500-pound variant was used against underground bunkers. Israel also used the new PB500A1 laser-guided hard-target penetration bomb, which was developed by Israel Military Industries, and is based on the 1000-pound Mark 83. There were unconfirmed reports of the IAF also using the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb for the first time. Israeli aircraft also used synthetic aperture radar targeting pods and high-resolution imaging pods. After being grounded six months prior, the Israeli fleet of AH-1F Cobra helicopter gunships were rushed back into service for the operation. The Israeli Air Force also used unmanned aerial vehicles firing Israeli- manufactured Spike missiles. According to the IAF, 80% of the bombs used by the IAF were precision weapons, and 99% of the air strikes hit their targets. A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that when possible, IAF executed strikes using the smallest precision-guided weapons, and coordinated air strikes and the use of artillery weapons using GPS, in a systematic effort to limit collateral damage. In a 2009 interview, Major General Ido Nehushtan said that the only use of non-precision-guided munitions from the Israeli Air Force was in open areas. He went on to say: \\"We had to find ways to do things as precisely and proportionately as possible, while focusing on how to differentiate between terrorists and uninvolved civilians.\\" The IDF also targeted homes of Hamas commanders, noting: \\"Destruction of hundreds of Hamas leaders' homes [is] one of the keys to the offensive's success. The homes serve as weapons warehouses and headquarters, and shelling them has seriously hindered Hamas capabilities.\\" Several high- ranking Hamas commanders were killed, including Nizar Rayan, Abu Zakaria al- Jamal, and Jamal Mamduch. Hamas leaders often died along with their families in their homes. According to a Hamas spokesperson and Rayyan's son, the IDF warned Rayan, by contacting his cell phone, that an attack on his house was imminent. Some Hamas leaders hid in the basements of the Shifa Hospital complex in Gaza City in the belief that they would be protected by human shields. Hamas Interior Minister Said Seyam, Hamas Interior Ministry Security Director Saleh Abu Sharkh, and local Hamas militia leader Mahmoud Abu Watfah were killed on 15 January in an Israeli airstrike in Jabalia.Jihad in Palestine: Political Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Shaul Bartal, Routledge, footnote 98 Destroyed building in Rafah, 12 January 2009 Among IDF's measures to reduce civilian casualties were the extensive use of leaflets and phone messages to warn Palestinians, including families in high- risk areas and families of Hamas personnel, to leave the area or to avoid potential targets. Israel used A-4 Skyhawks to deliver more than 2 million leaflets urging the population to evacuate. In a practice codenamed roof knocking, the IDF issued warning calls before air strikes on civilian buildings. Typically, Israeli intelligence officers and Shin Bet security servicemen contacted residents of a building in which they suspected storage of military assets and told them that they had 10–15 minutes to flee the attack.\\"> Archived version 2009-01-29 At several instances, the IDF has also used a sound bomb to warn civilians before striking homes. In some cases, IDF commanders called off airstrikes, when residents of suspected houses have been able to gather on its roof. IAF developed small bomb that is designed not to explode as it was aimed at empty areas of the roofs to frighten residents into leaving the building. Israel's military used low-explosive missiles to warn civilians of imminent attack and to verify that buildings were evacuated before attacks. Some of the attacks took place sooner than the warning suggested and many calls were not followed up with attacks. The Israeli Government report notes that while the warning systems implemented by the IDF did not eliminate all harm to civilians, they were apparently effective, because in many incidents aerial video surveillance by IDF forces confirmed the departure of numerous residents from targeted areas as a direct result of the warnings before the attacks. While Israel is not a party to the Protocol I, Israel accepts its provisions as reflective of customary international law.\\"Factual and legal aspects\\", Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 30 July 2009 By 3 January 2009, the Palestinian death toll stood at 400, with 25% estimated to be civilian casualties. The air offensive continued throughout the ground invasion that followed, and as of 15 January Israeli forces had carried out 2,360 air strikes. No safe haven or bomb shelters existed, making this one of the rare conflicts where civilians had no place to flee. The IAF had so far carried out 555 aerial sorties and 125 helicopter missions, and dozens of UAV flight hours were logged. Naval operations The Israeli Navy attacked Hamas' rocket launchers and outposts, command and control centers, a Hamas patrol boat, and the office of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, using the Typhoon Weapon System and Surface to surface missiles.Dover.idf.il The navy coordinated with other Israeli forces and used powerful shipboard sensors to acquire and shell targets on land. Records of the attacks published by the navy indicate that for the first time vessels were equipped with Spike ER electro-optically guided anti-armor missiles. Videos of an attack showed precision hits from a Typhoon stabilizing gun despite a rolling sea. Versions of the Spike were also used by ground units and possibly by helicopters or unmanned aerial vehicles.\\"Human Rights Watch accuses Israel over Gaza drones\\", Reuters, 30 June 2009 Shayetet 13 naval commandos were also deployed to attack targets on land, and reportedly attacked an Iranian ship loaded with arms for Hamas, which was docking in Sudan. On 28 December, Naval vessels shelled the Port of Gaza. On 29 December, the Free Gaza Movement relief boat Dignity carrying volunteer doctors with 3.5 tons of medical supplies, human rights activists (Among them Caoimhe Butterly and former US Representative Cynthia McKinney), and a CNN reporter was involved in an altercation with Israeli patrol boats. The captain of the Free Gaza vessel said that their vessel had been rammed intentionally and that there had been no warning before it had been rammed. An Israeli spokesman disputed this, and said the collision was caused by the Dignity attempting to outmaneuver the patrol boats after disobeying Israeli orders to turn back. On 4 January the Israeli Navy extended its blockade of the Gaza Strip to 20 nautical miles. Throughout the war, the Israeli Navy employed Sa'ar 4.5 class missile boats and Super Dvora Mk III class patrol boats. Ground invasion IDF infantry and armor units amassed near the Gaza border on 28 December, engaging in a blockade of the strip. On 29 December, a Palestinian mortar attack hit an Israeli military base along the Gaza border, killing one soldier and wounding several others.http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Victims/Pages/Lutfi_Nasraladin.aspx Explosion in Gaza, 12 January 2009 ISM photo:\\"Damage to the Zeitoun neighbourhood\\" On the evening of 3 January Israel began the ground operation with a massive artillery barrage all along the Gaza boundary, and ground forces were sent into Gaza for the first time since the start of the conflict. The ground invasion, termed the 'second stage' of Operation Cast Lead, sought to control open areas and encircle towns and refugee camps from which militants continued to launch rockets, but not penetrate densely populated areas. The Paratroopers, Golani, and Givati brigades simultaneously entered the Gaza Strip from several unexpected directions to avoid reported booby traps while also outflanking opposing forces. The 401st Armored Brigade used Merkava Mark IV tanks to quickly block access from Rafah and Khan Yunis to Gaza City, cutting supply lines to Hamas from the south. The move put psychological pressure on Hamas while also forcing combatants to withdraw from the front line. Israeli forces took strategic hilltops to better control areas. Weapons found in a mosque during Operation Cast Lead, according to the IDF The Israeli advance was spearheaded by Combat Engineering Corps sappers opening routes and allowing the ground forces to advance while dismantling booby traps set up in great numbers by Hamas, often set to detonate upon entry to a building. Improvised explosive devices (IED) were a concern for Israeli soldiers. One Israeli commander said that booby traps were found in a mosque and one-third of the houses. He said that some of the traps were designed to assist in taking IDF soldiers captive. All such attempts failed. The IDF used D9 armored bulldozers to ensure that paths were cleared of IEDs. These bulldozers were also used to destroy tunnels. The unmanned, remote-controlled version of the D9 (called Black Thunder) were also used. In one case an armored D9 knocked down a door, which triggered an explosion of a building full of explosive on top of the D9. The D9 survived the explosion and building's collapse. Combat engineers that inspected the rubbles found a tunnel, cache of weapons and remains of a suicide bomber.Tal Zagraba \\"Teddybears Tales\\" סיפורי דובים , BaMachane and Official IDF Combat Engineering Corps (in Hebrew) Viper miniature robots were deployed by Israeli forces for the first time. These were used for various tasks including the disabling of IEDs. Along with blocking mobile phone communication, the IDF employed electronic jamming equipment to disable remote operated explosives. Among others, The IDF used the new Bull Island system for the first time to identify booby traps in buildings. Bull Island uses a camera shaped like a tennis ball that can be thrown into a building to transfer 360-degree imagery to the troops outside of the structure. Israeli artillery units worked closely with battalion commanders. For the first time, the Sheder Ham digitized data, mapping, and command-and-control system linked the Artillery Corps into the Army's overall C4I network. Israel artillery fired approximately 7,000 rounds during the conflict. An Israel Defense Forces colonel stated that tactics and procedures had to suit the difficult urban environment. The number of rounds in the 22-day conflict was 5% of the total fired during the 34-day Lebanon war. Under the condition of anonymity, another officer said that close air support missions accounted for more than 90% of rounds fired. He also said that about half of those were MA25A1 incendiary-based smoke rounds used to mask troop movements. The Oketz Unit, the IDF's dog-handling corps, performed 33 successful missions during the war, with specially trained sniffer and attack dogs and their handlers leading advancing forces. In every mission that involved Oketz dogs, there were no casualties among soldiers. Three dogs were killed by enemy fire during the war.Buhbut, Amir: \\"With bared teeth: Oketz dogs to catch stone throwers\\". Maariv Hamas guerrillas sometimes emerged from tunnels to fire at IDF soldiers, then pulled back to lure troops into built-up areas. In one case, a Palestinian dressed in an Israeli Army uniform opened fire on a group of soldiers, but was killed before he could cause any casualties. In several instances, would-be suicide bombers with explosive vests charged Israeli soldiers, but all were killed before they could reach their targets. Israeli ground troops entered Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza in the early hours of 4 January.\\"Israeli ground troops enter Gaza\\", Al Jazeera English. 2009-01-04 Israeli forces reportedly bisected Gaza and surrounded Gaza City, but restricted their movements to areas that were not heavily urbanised. The IDF stated that it had targeted forty sites, including weapons depots and rocket launch sites. The Israeli military said that 50 Hamas fighters were killed and dozens more wounded. At least 25 Palestinian rockets were fired into Southern Israel, wounding a woman in Sderot. One Israeli soldier was killed and 19 other soldiers were wounded in Jabalia when a mortar shell fired by Hamas fighters landed on their patrol. As Israeli tanks and troops seized control of large parts of the Gaza Strip, tens of thousands of Gazans fled their homes amid artillery and gunfire, and flooded into the inner parts of Gaza city. On 5 January, IDF forces began operating in the densely populated urban centers of Gaza. Gun battles broke out between the IDF and Hamas on the streets of Gaza as the IDF surrounded the city.\\"Israeli troops and Hamas fighters clash in Gaza City\\" The Guardian. 2009-01-05. IDF combat units were sent in to capture Hamas fighters, and were met with grenades and mortar fire. The Israeli military said that 80–100 Hamas fighters were killed and 100 captured during heavy ground fighting. Some 40 rockets and mortar shells were fired at Israel, injuring four civilians. Israel continued to launch airstrikes and naval bombardments. IDF forces discover weapons in a mosque during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip. On 6 January, heavy fighting took place between Israeli troops and Palestinian militants on the outskirts of the northern district of Gaza City, while Israeli helicopter gunships pounded militant positions. The IDF reportedly widened its attacks to Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, after heavy fighting on the edges of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The Al Fakhura school was hit by Israeli mortar fire, and reports on deaths and if militants were among the casualties varied. The attack was originally reported as being on the school. In northern Gaza City, Palestinian gunmen ambushed an Israeli patrol, killing one soldier and wounding four. The patrol returned fire, hitting some of the gunmen, while in Jabalya, an Israeli tank fired a shell into an abandoned building as Golani Brigade soldiers were taking cover in it, killing 3 soldiers and wounding 24. The casualties were extracted under the cover of heavy artillery fire and helicopters dropping illumination bombs. In a separate friendly fire incident, an Israeli officer was killed by a misdirected artillery shell. In all, at least 70 Palestinians and 5 Israelis were killed on 6 January. Arms interdiction and the Sudan strike In January and February 2009, there was a series of two air strikes in Sudan and one in the Red Sea allegedly conducted by Israel against a convoy of 17 trucks containing Iranian arms, possibly Fajr-3 artillery rockets, being smuggled to the Gaza Strip through Sudan. A total of 39 were reported killed, with Iranian Revolutionary Guard operatives possibly among the dead. The attack was widely reported to have been conducted by Israeli aircraft, while the Israeli government hinted that it was behind the attack. Naval commandos from the elite Shayetet 13 unit were reportedly involved in the operation, which included an attack on an Iranian arms ship docking in Port Sudan. Attack on Gaza City White phosphorus artillery shell exploding over Gaza City on the 11 January On 7 January, Israel carried out 40 airstrikes overnight. Dozens of other targets were attacked by aircraft and artillery during the day, and the Gaza-Egypt border was bombed after Israeli aircraft dropped leaflets onto Rafah, urging the residents to leave. A total of 20 Palestinians were killed. A total of 20 rockets were fired into Southern Israel. Israel temporarily halted its attacks for three hours to provide a \\"humanitarian respite\\". On 8 January, an exchange of fire took place in Gaza City. Hamas suffered heavy losses, but an Israeli officer of the Golani Brigade was also killed. In Northern Gaza, snipers opened fire on Israeli forces conducting an operation, killing an Israeli soldier. Another Israeli soldier was lightly wounded. The IDF soldiers identified the origin of the fire and returned fire, directly hitting the snipers. In another incident, several mortar shells were fired at Givati Brigade soldiers, who responded with mortar fire and were aided by IAF airstrikes. In Central Gaza, a force of IDF soldiers entered a building near the Kissfum crossing. As the force entered, Hamas fighters fired an anti-tank rocket at them, killing one Israeli officer and wounding one soldier. Israeli aircraft also hit more than 40 Hamas targets in Gaza. Israeli troops shot and killed Hamas commander Amir Mansi and wounded two other Hamas fighters as they operated a mortar.Haaretz – IDF: Hamas men beginning to desert; army steps up Gaza op.

Israeli forces pushed into the south of the city and reached a key junction to its north. During their advance, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters ambushed Israeli troops at several locations, and heavy fighting ensued, in which 40 Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters were killed. Additionally, the IAF reported that Hamas operatives had tried to shoot down an IAF plane with anti-aircraft missiles for the first time since operations in Gaza began. Heavy machine gun fire against helicopters had also been unsuccessful. Two Hamas fighters were killed by an Israeli airstrike in the Southern Gaza Strip. A Palestinian woman was also killed by Israeli artillery fire. Israeli forces continued to push deeper into heavily populated areas around Gaza City. Fierce clashes were reported in the Southern suburb of Sheikh Ajleen. On 12 January, nearly 30 rockets and mortars were fired at Southern Israel, damaging a house in Ashkelon. Palestinians in a Gaza city neighbourhood on Day 18 of the War in Gaza On 13 January, Israeli tanks continued their advance toward the headquarters of Hamas' preventive security building from the al-Karramah neighborhood in the northwest and the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood in the northeast. The Israeli Army also said that 25 mortars and rockets were fired into Southern Israel. Before dawn, during the night, Israeli troops and tanks supported by artillery and helicopters advanced 300 metres into Tel al-Hawa, a neighborhood with several high-rise buildings, while Israeli gunboats shelled Hamas targets along the coast.Youtube.com (As provided by the official YouTube channel of Israeli Television) As troops entered the narrow streets, heavy street fighting with militants ensued leaving three Israeli soldiers wounded and 30 Hamas militants dead or wounded, according to the IDF. By morning IDF soldiers were still advancing slowly towards the city center and several buildings were in flames in Tel al-Hawa, where most of the fighting took place. Five Israeli soldiers were wounded during clashes with militants, and an officer was severely wounded by an explosion inside a booby-trapped building. The push into the neighborhood was Israel's deepest incursion into Gaza City. There was widespread desertion by members of the Qassam Brigades in the face of the IDF advance. On 15 January, Israeli artillery started an intense bombardment of the city while fighting was still going on in the streets. Troops and tanks advanced deeper into the city following the shelling. The Israeli military claimed to have killed dozens of militants since breaching the city limits four days earlier, while they suffered 20–25 soldiers wounded. Among buildings hit by shellfire was the al-Quds hospital, Gaza's second-largest, in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood. At least 14 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, wounding five and severely damaging a house in Sderot. Almost all members of Hamas' approximately 100-man strong \\"Iranian Unit\\" were killed during a battle in the Zeytoun neighborhood on 15 January. Members of the military wing had previously travelled to Iran for training by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. According to Palestinian sources, Iran was preparing for an end to the fighting and promised money and resources to rebuild military capabilities and infrastructure destroyed during the fighting. The headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) was also shelled on 15 January. There were 3 people injured and tons of food and fuel intended for 750,000 Palestinian refugees were destroyed. The Associated Press initially reported that an anonymous Israeli military official stated that Gaza militants had fired anti-tank weapons and machine guns from inside the compound. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said \\"it is absolutely true that we were attacked from that place, but the consequences are very sad and we apologize for it, I don't think it should have happened and I'm very sorry.\\" After UNRWA dismissed this as \\"nonsense\\", Israel ordered an army investigation into the incident.\\"Israel Shells UN Headquarters in Gaza\\" Atlantic Council 2009-01-19 Retrieved 2010-03-28 Israeli officials afterwards \\"came forward to say that preliminary results showed that the militants ran for safety inside the U.N. compound after firing on Israeli forces from outside\\".\\"Israel shells Gaza UN warehouse, hospital, media offices\\" China Daily 2009-01-16 Retrieved 2010-03-28 On 16 January, more than 50 Israeli airstrikes were carried out against militants, tunnels, and a mosque suspected of being used as a weapons store. Israeli forces continued their push into Gaza City, while Israeli Navy vessels shelled militant targets in support. About 10 rockets were fired into Southern Israel. Palestinian militants fired 15 rockets into Israel, wounding eight people including a pregnant woman. The Givati Brigade penetrated the deepest into Gaza City. The brigade's reconnaissance battalion swept into the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood and took over two 15-story buildings in search of Hamas operatives two days before the cease fire went into effect. About 40 Palestinian fighters were killed during the operation. The commander of the brigade, Colonel Ilan Malka, was critical of Hamas' use of civilian houses and said that he \\"took many steps to prevent our soldiers from getting hurt\\". Malka told reporters that the IDF had initially predicted each battalion would lose six or seven soldiers. The Israeli government considered a third phase of the operation with the intent of dealing a \\"knock out blow\\" to Hamas. Military and intelligence assessments indicating that shifting the goal to destroying Hamas would require additional weeks of deep ground incursions into urban areas and refugee camps. This was expected to result in heavy casualties on both sides and among civilians, reduce the strong domestic support for the war, and increase international criticism. Humanitarian ceasefires Due to the number of civilian casualties and the deteriorating humanitarian situation, Israel faced significant international pressure for a ceasefire, the establishment of a humanitarian corridor, access to the population of Gaza and the lifting of the blockade. On 7 January, Israel opened a humanitarian corridor to allow the shipment of aid into Gaza. The Israeli army agreed to interrupt fighting for three hours and Hamas agreed not to launch rockets during the pause. Israel repeated the ceasefire either daily or every other day. Aid officials and the UN praised the truce, but said it was not enough as fighting usually resumed immediately following the humanitarian ceasefires.CNN Exchange of fire mars 3-hour truce in Gaza, 7 January 2009 An Israeli Government report, published in July 2009, notes that during the period between 8 and 17 January, Hamas fired a total of 44 rockets and mortars at Israel during humanitarian pauses.\\"Factual and Legal Aspects\\", p. 72 Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, July 2009 An independent report commissioned jointly by the Israeli NGO Physicians for Human Rights and the Palestinian Medical Relief Society notes that according to testimonies by local witnesses, there were several cases where IDF ground forces breached the daily ceasefire agreement.\\"Final Report – Independent fact-finding mission into violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip during the period 27.12.2008 – 18.01.2009\\", p. 10, p. 60 PHR-Israel and PMRS, April 2009 =Palestinian paramilitary activity= According to Human Rights Watch rockets from Gaza were fired from populated areas.

IDF Brigadier-General Eyal Eisenberg said that roadside bombs were planted in TV satellite dishes, adding that Hamas booby-trapping of homes and schools was \\"monstrous\\" and \\"inhumane\\". Ron Ben-Yishai, an Israeli military correspondent embedded with invading ground forces, stated that entire blocks of houses were booby-trapped and wired in preparation for urban confrontation with the IDF. Israel said a map showing the deployment of explosives and Hamas forces in the al-Atatra neighborhood in northern Gaza was found. The map reportedly showed that Hamas placed many explosives and firing positions in residential areas, several mosques, and next to a gas station. Israel deployed the elite Sayeret Yahalom combat engineering unit throughout the brigades with new equipment including miniature robots and improved wall- breaching munitions to counter the booby-traps. thumb An example of a weapons cache found in northern Gaza. According to Jane's Defence Weekly, armed groups in Gaza counted domestically produced anti-armor RPGs like al-Battar and Banna 1 and Banna 2 in their arsenal. Hamas and Islamic Jihad also manufactured a variety of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), some of which were anti- personnel bombs and others were planted on the sides of roads or underground to be activated against tanks and armored personnel carriers. According to The Jerusalem Post, some of the IEDs were manufactured from medicine bottles transferred to the Gaza Strip as humanitarian aid by Israel. The same newspaper also reported that Hamas representatives said they were fighting with the aid of armored vehicles and weapons confiscated from the Palestinian National Authority, given by Israel, the United States and other countries. thumb A weapons cache in found in northern Gaza. At least one Palestinian witness told an Italian reporter that on many roofs of the tall buildings that were hit by Israeli bombs, including UN building, there were rocket-launchers or Hamas look-outs. On 27 January, the Shin Bet released details given by Hamas captives, including the militants' use of mosques for weapon caches and military training. Militants admitted to the location of Hamas weapon storage sites, in tunnels, in the homes of activists, and in citrus groves and mosques, and told of theory instruction given in mosques as well. Following the visit of the British Army veteran Colonel Tim Collins to the ruins of one of the mosques targeted by the IDF in Rafah, he said that in his view the evidencies of the secondary explosion, that could have indicated weapon's storage in the mosque, are present.\\"Celebrated Iraq war veteran's view of the Gaza conflict\\" BBC News, 20 January 2010 Palestinian rockets in Gaza According to Human Right Watch, On 24 December 2008, a rocket struck a bedroom of a family living in the Tel al-Hawa area in southern Gaza City, critically wounding one man. The brother of this victim told after the incident no armed group came to apologize. \\"I was next door in my home when this all happened.

We stay away from the houses if we can, but that's often impossible.\\" According to BBC, Palestinian groups had been firing \\"in response to Israeli massacres\\". The strike range of Hamas rockets had increased from 16 km (9.9 mi) to 40 km (25 mi) since early 2008 with the use of improved Qassam and factory-made rockets.\\"FACTBOX-Hamas's arsenal of rockets\\", Reuters 06-01-2009 These attacks resulted in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure. Rockets reached major Israeli cities Ashdod, Beersheba and Gedera for the first time, putting one-eighth of Israel's population in rocket range. On 3 January 2009 Ma'an News Agency reported: \\"The Al-Qassam Brigades, military wing of Hamas, said that after a week since the start of the 'Battle of Al-Furqan [the criterion]' it has managed to fire 302 rockets, at an average of 44 rockets daily.\\" As of 13 January 2009, Palestinian militants had launched approximately 565 rockets and 200 mortars at Israel since the beginning of the conflict, according to Israeli security sources. A source close to Hamas described the movement's use of stealth when firing: \\"They fired rockets in between the houses and covered the alleys with sheets so they could set the rockets up in five minutes without the planes seeing them. The moment they fired, they escaped, and they are very quick.\\" It is reported that 102 rockets and 35 mortars were fired by Fatah, Hamas' chief rival. Besides the rockets fired by the Qassam Brigades of Hamas, other factions claimed responsibility for rockets fired into Israel and attacks on Israeli soldiers, including Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades (affiliated with Fatah), the Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades, the Quds Brigades and the Popular Resistance Councils. A Fatah official stated that the rocket attacks by his faction contradicted the official position of Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah leader and President of the Palestinian National Authority. Abbas had called on all sides to cease hostilities unconditionally. Militants fired over 750 rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel during the conflict. Bersheeba and Gedera were the farthest areas hit by rocket or mortars. The rockets killed three civilians and one IDF soldier and wounded 182 people, with another 584 people suffering from shock and anxiety. The rockets also caused property damage, including damage to three schools.Ynetnews \\"Rocket barrages hit Beersheba, Ashkelon; 5 lightly hurt\\", 31 December 2008\\"Rockets reach Beersheba, cause damage\\", Ynetnews, 30 December 2008.\\"Rocket lands near Ashdod kindergarten; no injuries\\", Ynetnews, 11 January 2009. Senior Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar stated during the operation \\"they [Israeli forces] shelled everyone in Gaza.... They shelled children and hospitals and mosques, ... and in doing so, they gave us legitimacy to strike them in the same way.\\" Human Rights Watch noted in the open letter to Ismail Haniyeh that despite his Foreign Ministry stance as part of response to the Goldstone Report, Palestinian armed groups remain responsible for firing rockets indiscriminately or deliberately at Israeli civilian objects. HRW also noted that Palestinian militants put Palestinian civilians at risk of Israeli counter-attacks by launching rockets from populated areas. The UN fact finding mission stated that the firing of rockets at Israel constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was in violation of international law. After the war, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades revealed new rockets it used during Israel's military operation and published pictures of weapons (Tandem and RPG-29 anti- armor rockets) that it could secretly smuggle to Gaza.

Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert declared the ceasefire effective that night, at 00:00 GMT on 18 January. The ceasefire consisted of two phases: \\"First a ceasefire is declared. If Hamas stops firing rockets then Israel pulls its forces out of the Gaza Strip. If rocket fire resumes then the IDF goes back in, this time with the international backing gained by having tried a truce.\\" Olmert declared that the military objectives had been met. Hamas initially \\"vowed to fight on\\", and responded that any continued Israeli presence in Gaza would be regarded as an act of war. Farzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said before the ceasefire began, \\"The occupier must halt his fire immediately and withdraw from our land and lift his blockade and open all crossings and we will not accept any one Zionist soldier on our land, regardless of the price that it costs.\\" Palestinian militants resumed rocket fire into southern Israel the following Sunday morning, four of the six fired landed in or near Sderot. The Israeli military returned fire and launched an air strike against the rocket launching site in northern Gaza. On 18 January Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other paramilitias said they would stop launching rockets into Israel for one week and demanded \\"the withdrawal of the enemy forces from the Gaza Strip within a week, along with the opening of all the crossings for the entry of humanitarian aid, food and other necessities for our people in the Gaza Strip\\".\\"Hamas, Israel set independent cease-fires\\". CNN 18 January 2009\\"Hamas announces ceasefire in Gaza\\", BBC, 2009-18-01 Three days later, the last Israeli troops left Gaza. Since the unilateral ceasefires were declared on 17 January, militants have fired rockets and mortar shells from Gaza, and the IDF has launched airstrikes against Gaza. =Continued negotiations= Egyptian mediators held discussions with Israel and Hamas about extending the cease- fire by a year or more. Hamas and Fatah met to allow both to play a role in rebuilding. Israel began pressuring Egypt to do more to stop weapons smuggling into Gaza, the halting of which is one of Israel's central demands in extending a cease-fire. On 27 January 2009, Foreign Minister of Egypt Ahmed Aboul Gheit discouraged Britain, France and Germany from sending warships to patrol the waters off Gaza, which the three European nations felt could help halt seaborne smuggling. Gheit said such efforts would harm Europe's relations with the Arab world. Egypt also opposed proposals for European troops to be stationed on the border between Gaza and Egypt to monitor smuggling tunnels.Witte, Griff. \\"Blast at Gaza Border Kills Israeli Soldier; Palestinian Farmer Killed by Gunfire\\". The Washington Post, 28 January 2009. Retrieved on 2008-01-28. Israel, along with many Western and some Arab countries, wanted international aid groups to control aid from donations around the world, so that Hamas would not receive credit for the rebuilding. To speed up reconstruction, Hamas agreed that it would not insist on collecting reconstruction money itself and would allow donated money to flow through different avenues based on the various alliances, although Hamas ultimately expected to administer the aid. But advisors to senior Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said Israel's willingness to open the border for humanitarian aid only was unacceptable, as Hamas would need much more to rebuild its economy and provide relief for citizens. Haniyeh aides said the cease-fire is contingent on a full border opening. Shortly after becoming President of the United States, Barack Obama directed newly appointed special envoy to the Middle East George J. Mitchell to visit Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia for peace talks. Mitchell began his meetings in Cairo on 27 January 2009, and Obama said his visit was part of the President's campaign promise to listen to both sides of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and work toward a Middle East peace deal. Mitchell did not plan to talk to Hamas, but instead focus on talks with the more moderate Palestinian Authority. A spokesman for Haniyeh said he respected Mitchell, but was disappointed with the envoy's decision not to hold discussions with Hamas. Ehud Olmert stated that Israel would not agree to a long term truce or lift the blockade on Gaza without the freeing of Gilad Shalit, an IDF soldier held captive in Gaza since June 2006. Hamas demanded that Israel release 1,400 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit and such negotiations be kept separate from ceasefire negotiations. Post-war military assessment The war was an Israeli tactical victory and a significant tactical defeat for Hamas.Ethan Bonner, Hamas Shifts From Rockets to Culture War The New York Times, 24 July 2009.David Makovsky, Preliminary Assessment of Israel's Operation Cast Lead The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, 23 January 2009 Al-Qassam Brigades reported in \\"The outcome of al-Qassam operations during the Battle of al-Furqan\\" they killed 102 Israeli soldiers. On 19 January 2009, a spokesperson for the group said on al-Arabiya \\"Israel lost 'at least 80 soldiers' in the fighting\\" and said about Hamas losses \\"only 48 fighters slain in Israel war\\". According to United Nations report of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission of Human Rights Council, which was on General Assembly's agenda on 29 October 2009: \\"The large discrepancy in the data confirms the Mission's observations below in the report about the reliability of the information about the Gaza military operations posted on websites of al-Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups.\\" In November 2010, the Hamas Interior Minister acknowledged that around 700 militants part of Hamas and affiliated factions were killed in the war. Several senior Hamas military commanders and politburo members were killed, as well as approximately 50 explosives experts. Hamas experienced \\"widespread desertion\\" in the face of the Israeli advance. Hamas also lost a very large amount of weaponry and equipment; key storage facilities were discovered under mosques and public buildings. A former Shin Bet deputy director who co-authored a report on the war noted, \\"Hamas had planned to stand and fight, but the Iz al- Qassam Brigades proved unequal to the task ... and consequently they failed to match the public image Hamas has tried so hard to present of stalwart, proficient Islamic warriors.\\" In addition, the Israeli operation greatly curtailed years of Hamas rocket fire, returning a sense of normalcy to Southern Israel.Bronner, Painful Mideast Truth: Force Trumps Diplomacy 20 October 2009. In the year before the war, Hamas had fired over 3,300 rockets at Israel's Gaza periphery towns. That number dropped to less than 300 in the ten months following the conflict.Isabel Kershner \\"Along Gaza, a Quiet (But Still Tense) Life\\" The New York Times 9 October 2009. Defense analyst David Eshel stated, \\"The success of Operation Cast Lead in the densely populated Gaza Strip shows that an industrial military that coordinates operations among land, air and sea units, makes effective use of advanced technology, and shares intelligence and leads from the front can decisively defeat an asymmetrical enemy.\\" He further noted, \\"Israel used a variety of tactics to outflank and defeat Hamas in its own territory. These included long-term planning, meticulous intelligence-gathering, deception and disinformation.\\" As a result of its poor performance, Hamas relieved at least two brigade commanders on Iranian advice, and reportedly stripped 100 fighters of their membership. The organization decided to initiate a thorough investigation of the conduct of its fighters during the operation. Hamas' leadership modified its tactical doctrine. The Qassam Brigades intensified military training at its various training camps and military academy in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The new training was thought to be more offensive, with a focus on hitting the rear of an IDF force. Hezbollah operatives were suspected of involvement in the program. In contrast to the pre-war period, when Hamas openly displayed its capabilities, the nature of the program was kept classified. The Israeli army said it destroyed about 80% of the tunnels between Gaza and Egypt that were being used to bring in weapons and rocket components. Residents in Rafah said they cleared away debris and discovered that many of the tunnels were intact, though they acknowledged the destruction of many.

Al Mezan Centre for Human Rights said in January 2009, that 1,268 people were killed, among them 288 children and 103 women, and 85% of those killed were not combatants. The IDF tallied 295 killed civilians, least 709 armed militants and 162 undetermined.

Sebastian Rotella and Rushdi abu Alouf, Los Angeles Times, 13 January 2009 = Civilians versus combatants = In any conflict, the ratio of combatant and civilian deaths is a highly sensitive topic. During the fighting in the Gaza War, the main source for the number of Palestinian casualties was Hamas' Ministry of Health in Gaza. The ICRC used these figures, but at a later stage it made its own assessment. Because Israel allowed very few international workers and journalists in Gaza during much of the conflict, it has been difficult to verify the figures independently.\\"Counting casualties of Gaza's war\\". Bethany Bell, BBC News, 28 January 2009 In The Jerusalem Post, Israeli-Arab journalist Khaled Abu Toameh suggested that killed fighters in civilian clothes led to the over-counting of civilian casualties and under- counting Hamas military casualties, as Palestinian casualties arrived at hospitals without weapons or any other signs revealing they were fighters.Khaled Abu Toameh, Analysis: Trumpets of victory strike false note, The Jerusalem Post, 20 January 2009 B'Tselem wrote that its fatalities classification was based on the guidelines of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) published in June 2009. The PCHR civilian count includes Hamas members killed in what the PCHR assessed were non-combat situations. The Al Mezan centre defined combatants as \\"those taking up arms against Israeli troops.\\" The Israeli International Institute for Counter- Terrorismhttp://www.ict.org.il/images/ICT_Cast_Lead_Casualties- A_Closer_Look.pdf and SPME have contested the classifications of B'Tselem and PCHR.  Gazan police  During the conflict Israel targeted numerous police facilities in Gaza. Many of these attacks occurred during the first minutes of the operations resulting in the deaths of 99 policemen and nine other members of the public. The attacks on Police during the first day of the operation included the bombing of a police cadet graduation ceremony, killing scores of police cadets along with family members who had come to attend the celebration. Police cadets killed in the incident included traffic police and musicians in the police orchestra. The UN fact finding mission established that approximately 240 Gaza policemen were killed by Israeli forces during the course of the conflict constituting over one sixth of the total Palestinian casualties. = Legality = The UN Fact Finding Mission analysed the police institutions in Gaza from the time Hamas gained control. They concluded that the Gaza police were a civilian law-enforcement agency and that Israel's blanket targeting of the Gaza police was therefore a violation of international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch stated that police are presumptively civilians but on a specific case-by-case basis can be considered valid targets if formally incorporated into the armed forces of a party to a conflict or directly participate in the hostilities. They stressed that blanket decisions must not be made about police being legitimate targets and that a decision that police and police stations are legitimate military targets depends on whether those police play a role in fighting against Israel, or whether a particular police station is used to store weapons or for some other military purpose.\\"Israel/Gaza: Civilians must not be targets\\". Human Rights Watch, 30 December 2008 B'Tselem also states that police officers are presumed to be civilians and likely not legitimate objects of attack under international humanitarian law. = Israeli views = The Israeli Orient Research Group reported that 78 of the 89 killed during this first IAF strike were terror operatives, many of them belonging to the militant group, al- Qassam Brigades. The Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs further reported that 286 of the 343 police officers killed during the offensive were members of terror organizations and that another 27 fighters belonged to units undergoing infantry training. It noted that the security apparatuses participated in terror activity and that the Hamas leadership presented these organizations as at the forefront of the jihad for liberating all of Palestine. The IDF made clear that it regards police under the control of Hamas in Gaza to be equivalent to the enemies armed fighters, including them in the militant's count. A government paper published pictures of four men that were killed during the military operations that they claim were downloaded from Palestinian websites. The men are identified in the different pictures as both policemen and members of al-Qassam Brigades. Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (ITIC) alleged that the distinction between the internal security forces and Hamas military wing is not sharply defined and cites Gaza police officials who said that police were instructed to fight the enemy in case of an invasion into the Gaza Strip. Many security force members were reported to \\"moonlight\\" with the militant group, Izzidin al-Qassam Brigades. = Gazan rockets = During the conflict, Palestinian groups fired rockets targeting Israeli civilians in the cities of Ashdod, Beersheba and Gedera placing 1/8 of the Israeli population at risk. The military wing of Hamas said that after a week from the start, it had managed to fire 302 rockets, at an average of 44 rockets daily. 102 rockets and 35 mortars were fired by Fatah at Israel. Over 750 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into Israel during the conflict wounded 182 civilians, killing 3 people, and causing minor suffering to another 584 people suffering from shock and anxiety. Several rockets landed in schools and one fell close to a kindergarten, all located in residential areas. The UN fact finding mission stated that this constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was unjustifiable in international law. Aftermath Israel was victorious militarily, but its reputation was harmed. The international community continued to isolate Hamas (except for Iran and Syria), because it rejected the Quartet demands to recognize Israel, accept the Oslo accords peace initiative and abandon violence in exchange for international recognition as representatives of the Palestinian people. In the months following the war, Hamas suspended its use of rockets and shifted focus to winning support at home and abroad through cultural initiatives and public relations, with the aim to build a \\"cultural resistance\\". Hamas officials stated that \\"The current situation required a stoppage of rockets. After the war, the fighters needed a break and the people needed a break.\\"\\"Hamas Shifts From Rockets to Culture War\\", The New York Times, 24 July 2009 Propaganda and psychological warfareHamas= Before and during the conflict, Hamas' senior representatives released a number of statements designed to avert Israeli decision-makers from launching any military operation in Gaza and to cause demoralization among Israelis. Before the end of the pre-conflict ceasefire, Hamas boasted that it had countless surprises awaiting Israeli troops, should they advance. Hamas representatives threatened on several occasions to abduct Israeli soldiers, and during the ground invasion tried to spread rumors that it actually had captured or killed more Israeli soldiers. On a video broadcast on Al-Aqsa TV on 10 January showing the names of Israeli towns hit by rockets, it was implied Tel-Aviv is the next target and that 'all options are open'. Also, Hamas sent messages in Hebrew to Israeli citizens' mobile phones warning: \\"Rockets on all cities, shelters will not protect you.\\" Hamas instrumentalized the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit as a form of psychological weapon, declaring that he had been wounded by Israeli fire, later announcing that his condition was no longer of interest to them. According to IDF spokesman, Hamas' ruses in the battlefield included booby traps throughout Gaza's neighborhoods, such as mannequins placed at apartment entrances and rigged to explode when the soldiers approach. Arab television stations reported Hamas-provided statistics for Israeli casualties on the assumption that Israel is distorting its own figures of soldiers killed and wounded. A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies notes that Hamas propaganda both rejected Hamas responsibility for the fighting and used it to attack the Palestinian Authority. Dr. Tal Pavel from Israeli think- tank International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) said that Hamas uses its Web sites to make comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany, portraying Israel as a destructive, oppressive regime afraid of Hamas rockets raining on Tel Aviv. =Israel= The day before the beginning of the offensive on 27 December the IDF pulled troops back from the border and used its radio channels to broadcast talk of a \\"lull\\" to achieve a disinformation coup to lure Hamas fighters out of hiding. A broadcaster in Islamic Jihad's Voice of Jerusalem radio station in Gaza City reported that IDF have been breaking into his station signal \\"least once an hour\\" during conflict intensification to broadcast messages to Gaza's population that their problems were due to Hamas. The Israelis also dropped leaflets with similar messages and contact info to report about the whereabouts of militant leaders and weapons caches. The leaflets also noted, \\"The Israeli army will respond if the rocket fire continues.\\" In war zones, leaflets warned local residents that they had to flee. It also warned residents that their homes would be targeted if they were located in an area of possible target. Dr. Yaniv Levitan of the University of Haifa said that the aim of the flyers was not to demoralize the civil population, but to implant recognition in hearts and minds that Hamas has failed, that there is an option of choosing another path. IDF spokespersons often reported that scores of demoralized Hamas fighters had been observed deserting. According to Ephraim Kam, deputy head of the Institute of National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, the claim could not be confirmed but it strengthened the Israeli population's will to continue and undermined the confidence of Hamas in Gaza. There was a mistrust of phone calls warning messages to people that they have \\"just minutes to evacuate before they bomb the house\\". According to a human rights lawyer at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR), despite the hundreds of phone calls to families warning their house is about to be blown up, only 37 were destroyed, presumably as of 3 January date. Controversies regarding tactics Both Israel and Hamas were accused of using controversial military tactics during the 2008–2009 Gaza War. =Controversial tactics allegedly used by Hamas=Civilians as human shields Israel maintained that Hamas used civilians, and especially children, as human shields, as a part of its war doctrine. They said that Hamas repeatedly called upon Palestinian civilians to gather near buildings where they feared that the IDF was about to launch air-strikes against Hamas targets. They documented several examples of what they described as \\"calls in the Hamas controlled Gaza media for Palestinians civilians to serve as human shields\\". They released footage allegedly showing Hamas' Al-Aqsa TV calling upon children to form a human shield at various structures in Gaza to prevent anticipated IDF airstrikes, and an Al-Aqsa TV News broadcast describing how a crowd of civilians gathered on the roof of Abu Bilal al-Ja'abeer to stop the IDF from executing an airstrike.Amnesty International's investigation of these claims found no evidence that Hamas or any other Palestinian militant group had 'directed the movement of civilians to shield military objectives from attacks.' It did find that Israeli soldiers had deployed Palestinian civilians and children to shield themselves.Norman Finkelstein,Gaza: An Inquest into Its Martyrdom, University of California Press, 2018 pp.68-81 pp.70-71,p.70.

Later, the IDF and Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs compiled a film accusing Hamas of a systematic use of civilian infrastructure and civilians as a human shield.

Hamas and the Terrorist Threat from the Gaza Strip The Main Findings of the Goldstone ReportVersus the Factual Findings, Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center. The former commander of the British forces in Afghanistan, Col. Richard Kemp, testified at UN Human Rights Council 12th Special Session that Israel encountered an \\"enemy that deliberately positioned its military capability behind the human shield of the civilian population\\".Goodenough, Patrick.

Retrieved on 2011-06-18. The commander of the military-terrorist wing of the PFLP-GC in the Gaza Strip stated in an interview that some areas did not present a problem because of the \\"population and building density\\" that would \\"provide the resistance with a shield\\". Hamas operation centre in the middle of a civilian area. Professor Newton, expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of United Nations Fact Finding Mission criticised a statement by a Hamas brigade commander who said, \\"The entire people of Gaza are the combatants and therefore, it is appropriate for us to issue warnings and then whether – if, even if they disregard them, to occupy their basement or their house or their backyard.\\" Professor Newton stated that the legal obligation was to never commingle civilian and military objectives. The New York Times quotes a study published by the Israel-based Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, charging Hamas with methodically building its military infrastructure in the heart of population centers. According to the study, Hamas not only hides among the population, but has made a main component of its combat strategy \\"channeling\\" the army into the densely populated areas to fight. During the Gaza War, Hamas invested great effort in preventing civilians from leaving neighborhoods that were in the line of fire and letting them flee to the south of the Strip. After Israeli forces fired shells near a UN school in Gaza killing around 30 people, Israel's military said the shelling was in response to mortar fire from within the school and asserted that Hamas were using civilians as cover. They stated that the dead near the school included Hamas members of a rocket launching cell. Two residents of the area confirmed that a group of militants were firing mortar shells from near the school and identified two of the victims as Hamas militants. The Goldstone report found indications that Palestinian armed groups launched rockets from urban areas. The Mission was not able to obtain any direct evidence of specific intent of shielding the rocket launchers from counterstrokes by the Israeli armed forces.Goldstone report, pp. 146–148 ,paragraph 477–486, 15 September 2009 From a legal perspective, the report said that the launching of attacks close to civilian buildings would have unnecessarily exposed the civilian population of Gaza and violated the customary rules of international humanitarian law and the right to life of the endangered civilians. The Goldstone report concluded that there was evidence of the presence of Palestinian armed groups in residential areas. The report noted that because of the densely populated nature of the northern half of the Gaza strip, once the Israeli forces gained control of the outlying areas in the first few days of the ground invasion, most, if not all, locations still accessible to the Palestinian militants would have been in urban areas. It would be difficult to avoid mixing with the civilian population in the small and overcrowded Gaza Strip. The report concluded that the Israeli Government had not produced any evidence to support its allegation that Palestinian combatants \\"mingle routinely with civilians in order to cover their movements\\". According to the book The Goldstone Report 'Reconsidered, a compilation of essays authored by legal scholars and published by the pro- Israel group NGO Monitor, the conclusions were false and largely based on unverified claims made by NGOs. Combatant use of civilian clothes A New York Times journalist asserted that Hamas militants were fighting in civilian clothes. Some NGO reports suggested that in general members of Palestinian armed groups did not wear military uniforms and mixed with the civilian population. The UN Fact Finding Mission (Goldstone Mission), however, concluded in its report: ″While reports reviewed by the Mission credibly indicate that members of Palestinian armed groups were not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from civilians, the Mission found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack.″ Military use of medical facilities and uniforms An IDF investigation concluded that Hamas forced the Red Crescent to hand over medic and nurse uniforms for its operatives and commandeered ambulances for fighters transportation during the War. Palestinian civilians living in Gaza detailed Hamas' attempts to hijack ambulances and the wearing of paramedic uniforms by Hamas fighters. An ambulance driver registered with and trained by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society spoke of Hamas' efforts to \\"lure the ambulances into the heart of a battle to transport fighters to safety\\" and the hijacking of the al-Quds Hospital's fleet of ambulances. The IDF claimed that Hamas operated a command and control center inside Shifa Hospital in Gaza City throughout the War, and that Hamas field commanders exploited the daily cessation in fighting that the IDF established for humanitarian purposes to receive instructions from senior Hamas officials. Addressing the Israeli cabinet, an intelligence official claimed that senior members of Hamas sought refuge in the sub-level floors believing that Israel would not target them for fear that such a strike would invariably lead to heavy collateral damage to the hospital patients in the upper floors. Next to the hospital, Militants set up posts that were used for the firing of mortars. Underneath a mosque that was located alongside the hospital was discovered a tunnel leading to the maternity ward, which was used by Hamas operatives to move undetected. After an Israeli airstrike on the central prison, which resulted in prisoners being released into the streets, several of the 115 prisoners accused of collaboration with Israel who had not yet been tried were executed by Hamas militants wearing civilian clothes in the Shifa hospital compound. The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israel-based group with close ties to the Israeli military establishment, reported that Hamas made extensive use of the Al-Fahoura Medical Centre and that they established a military camp and training base next to it. The ITIC released aerial pictures showing tunnels dug around the building and the medical centre and that the area surrounding the hospital was heavily mined. Rockets were launched in close proximity of the centre. The ITIC report stated that Hamas used 10 Gazan hospitals for launching rockets at Israeli towns and for attacking IDF troops. Hamas also set up a command centre within a children's hospital located in the Nasser neighbourhood of Gaza City, which was used by top Hamas leadership on the night of 27 December. Senior Hamas commanders also set up a command center in a Red Crescent Society clinic in Khan Yunis. An IDF probe, released on 22 April 2009, stated that a UN vehicle was attacked by Israeli forces because a Palestinian anti-tank squad was being unloaded from the vehicle. Amnesty International rejected the charges by Israel that Hamas had systematically used medical facilities, vehicles and uniforms as a cover, stating that no evidence had been provided proving such actions. Further, Magen David Adom's submission to the UN Mission investigating the war stated \\"there was no use of PRCS ambulances for the transport of weapons or ammunition ... [and] there was no misuse of the emblem by PRCS.\\" Following its investigations the Goldstone report concluded that it \\"did not find any evidence to support the allegations that hospital facilities were used by the Gaza authorities or by Palestinian armed groups to shield military activities and that ambulances were used to transport combatants or for other military purposes\\". =Controversial tactics allegedly used by Israel= Collective punishment  The United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict found that Israel, at least in part, targeted the people of Gaza as a whole. The Mission gave its opinion that ″the operations were in furtherance of an overall policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population for its resilience and for its apparent support for Hamas, and possibly with the intent of forcing a change in such support.″\\"Goldstone Report\\", paragr. 1680–81 Judge Goldstone later at least partially resiled from this conclusion. Disproportionate force Israel was widely criticised by human rights groups for using heavy firepower and causing hundreds of civilian casualties. A group of soldiers who took part in the conflict echoed the criticism through both the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence and a special report by Israeli filmmaker Nurit Kedar that was shown on Britain's Channel 4 in January 2011. Israel was accused of having a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population. Israel has said that operational orders emphasised proportionality and humanity while the importance of minimising harm to civilians was made clear to soldiers. Retired U.S. Army colonel Douglas Macgregor gave his opinion as: \\"They went in heavy, with lots of firepower. But at the same time, because of good intel and other improvements, they were able to be selective and cut down on collateral damage.\\" IDF use of human shields On 24 March, a report from the UN team responsible for the protection of children in war zones was released: it found \\"hundreds\\" of violations of the rights of children and accused Israeli soldiers of using children as human shields, bulldozing a home with a woman and child still inside, and shelling a building they had ordered civilians into a day earlier. One case involved using an 11-year-old boy as a human shield, by forcing him to enter suspected buildings first and also inspect bags. The report also mentioned the boy was used as a shield when Israeli soldiers came under fire. The Guardian has also received testimony from three Palestinian brothers aged 14, 15, and 16, who all claimed to have been used as human shields. The UK newspaper The Guardian conducted an investigation of its own, which, according to the paper, uncovered evidence of war crimes including the use of Palestinian children as human shields. An Israeli military court later convicted two Israeli soldiers of using human shields, which was outlawed by the Israeli Supreme court in 2005. The UN fact-finding mission investigated four incidents in which Palestinian civilians were coerced, blindfolded, handcuffed and at gunpoint to enter houses ahead of Israeli soldiers during military operations. The mission confirmed the continued use of this practice with published testimonies of Israeli soldiers who had taken part in the military operations. The mission concluded that these practices amounted to using civilians as human shields in breach of international law. Some civilians were also questioned under threat of death or injury to extract information about Palestinian combatants and tunnels, constituting a further violation of international humanitarian law. White phosphorus From 5 January, reports emerged of use by Israel of white phosphorus during the offensive, which was initially denied by Israel. There were numerous reports of its use by the IDF during the conflict. On 12 January, it was reported that more than 50 phosphorus burns victims were in Nasser Hospital. On 16 January the UNRWA headquarters was hit with phosphorus munitions. As a result of the hit, the compound was set ablaze. On completion of the three-day Israeli withdrawal (21 January) an Israeli military spokeswoman said that shells containing phosphorus had been used in Gaza but said that they were used legally as a method to provide a smokescreen.\\"Israel admits using white phosphorus in attacks on Gaza\\" The Times 24 January 2009. The IDF reiterated their position on 13 January saying that it used weapons \\"in compliance with international law, while strictly observing that they be used according to the type of combat and its characteristics\\". On 25 March 2009, the United States- based human rights organization Human Rights Watch published a 71-page report titled \\"Rain of Fire, Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza\\" and said that Israel's usage of the weapon was illegal. PDF Donatella Rovera, Amnesty's researcher on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories said that such extensive use of this weapon in Gaza's densely populated residential neighbourhoods is inherently indiscriminate. \\"Its repeated use in this manner, despite evidence of its indiscriminate effects and its toll on civilians, is a war crime,\\" she said.\\"Israel used white phosphorus in Gaza civilian areas\\". Amnesty International (19 January 2009) Retrieved 30 May 2011 The Goldstone report accepted that white phosphorus is not illegal under international law but did find that the Israelis were \\"systematically reckless in determining its use in built-up areas\\". It also called for serious consideration to be given to the banning of its use as an obscurant. Videos by Al Jazeera of the 2008–2009 Gaza War After watching footage of Israeli troop deployments on television, a British soldier who completed numerous combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Intelligence Corps defended the Israeli Army's use of white phosphorus. The soldier noted, \\"White phosphorus is used because it provides an instant smokescreen, other munitions can provide a smokescreen but the effect is not instant. Faced with overwhelming enemy fire and wounded comrades, every commander would choose to screen his men instantly, to do otherwise would be negligent.\\" Colonel Lane, a military expert testifying in front of the fact-finding mission in July 2009, told that white phosphorus is used for smoke generation to hide from the enemy. He stated, \\"The quality of smoke produced by white phosphorus is superb; if you want real smoke for real coverage, white phosphorus will give it to you.\\"\\"Public hearings – Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009\\", UNHRC Professor Newton, expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of the committee, said that in an urban area, where potential perils are snipers, explosive devices and trip wires, one effective way to mask forces' movement is by white phosphorus. In certain cases, he added, such choice of means would be less harmful for civilian population than other munitions, provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test. In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case-by-case basis taking into account \\"the precise circumstances of its use, not in general, generically, but based on that target, at that time\\". He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area. He also said that in his view white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon and is not intended to cause damage. He said its use was not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention. An article by Mark Cantora examining the legal implications of the use of white phosphorus munitions by the IDF, published in 2010 in the Gonzaga Journal of International Law, argues that Israel's use of white phosphorus in Gaza was technically legal under existing international humanitarian laws and \\"Therefore, it is imperative for the international community to convene a White Phosphorus Convention Conference in order to address these issues and fill this substantial gap in international humanitarian law.\\"Mark Cantora, Israel and White Phosphorus During Operation Cast Lead: A Case Study in Adherence to Inadequate Humanitarian Laws, 13:1 Gonzaga Journal of International Law (2010), available at Dense inert metal explosives (DIME) Dense Inert Metal Explosive (DIME) is a type of bomb developed to minimize collateral damage.Amira Hass, \\"Norwegian doctor: Israel used new type of weapon in Gaza\\". Haaretz, 19 January 2009 Casualties show unusual injuries. A military expert working for Human Rights Watch said judging by the nature of the wounds and descriptions given by Gazans made it seem likely that Israel used DIME weapons. A Norwegian doctor who worked at Gaza's Shifa Hospital said that pressure waves generated by missile hits are likely the cause and produced by DIME weapons. Another Norwegian doctor said they had ″clear evidence that the Israelis are using a new type of very high explosive weapons which are called Dense Inert Metal Explosive″.\\"40 die in Israeli strike at school-Tel Aviv accused of using 'unconventional weapons'\\". Atul Aneja, The Hindu, 7 January 2009 Colonel Lane, military expert testifying in front of the fact-finding mission in July 2009, told the committee that through his studies, no actual proof was found that DIME rounds were used, but tungsten, iron, and sulfur were found in samples analyzed in a forensic lab. He is of the view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component to reduce the effect on the ground. Colonel Lane explained that the idea behind a Focused Lethality Munition (FLM), which is an example of a DIME munition, is that the fragments produced stay within a safety radius of about 6 meters, so anybody outside that radius is safe, while those within the area of dispersal will be affected severely. He commented on the documentations where medics described unusual amputations saying that he was no medical expert, but the use of a metal like tungsten and cobalt at short distances would likely have that effect. The Goldstone Report wrote that the Mission found that the allegations that DIME weapons were used by Israeli armed forces required further clarification and they were unable to ascertain their usage, though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact. It stated that the \\"focused lethality\\" reportedly pursued in DIME weapons could be seen as enhancing compliance with the principle of distinction between civilian and military objects. The report added that as it currently stands, DIME weapons and weapons armed with heavy metal are not prohibited under international law, but do raise specific health concerns.Goldstone report, UNHRC, para. 49 An Amnesty International report called on Israel to confirm or deny its use of DIME in order to facilitate the treatment of those injured in the conflict.\\"Fuelling conflict: foreign arms supplies to Israel/Gaza\\", Amnesty International, pp 17 After reports of similar cases in 2006, the IDF had denied the use of DIME weapons. After Israeli forces fired shells near a UN school in Gaza killing around 30 people, Israel's military said the shelling was in response to mortar fire from within the school and asserted that Hamas were using civilians as cover. They stated that the dead near the school included Hamas members of a rocket launching cell. Two residents of the area confirmed that a group of militants were firing mortar shells from near the school and identified two of the victims as Hamas militants. Accusations of misconduct by IDF soldiers Testimonies from Israeli soldiers allegedly admitting indiscriminate killings of civilians, as well as vandalizing homes, were reported in March 2009. Soon after the publication of the testimonies, reports implying that the testimonies were based on hearsay and not on the firsthand experience started to circulate. At the same time, another kind of evidence was collected from several soldiers who took part in the fighting, that rebutted claims of immoral conduct on the military's part during Gaza War. Following investigations, the IDF issued an official report, concluding that alleged cases of deliberate shooting at civilians did not take place. Nine Israeli rights groups reacting to the closure of the investigation issued a joint statement calling for an \\"independent nonpartisan investigative body to be established to look into all Israeli army activity\\" in Gaza. In July 2009, the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence published testimony from 26 soldiers (two junior officers and the rest enlisted personnel) who took part in the Gaza assault, claiming that the IDF used Gazans as human shields, improperly fired incendiary white phosphorus shells over civilian areas and used overwhelming firepower that caused needless deaths and destruction.\\"Soldiers' Testimonies from Operation Cast Lead, Gaza 2009\\", Breaking the Silence, 2009-07-15 The report did not represent a cross-section of the army, but rather they were troops who had approached the group or were reached through acquaintances of NGO members. The accusations were made by anonymous people who claimed that they were reserves soldiers and whose faces had been blurred in the filmed talks. An Israeli military spokesperson dismissed the testimonies as anonymous hearsay and questioned why Breaking the Silence had not handed over its findings before the media had been informed. The Israeli military said some allegations of misconduct had turned out to be second or third-hand accounts and the result of recycled rumours. Breaking the Silence state that their methodology includes the verification of all information by cross-referencing the testimonies it collects and that published material has been confirmed by a number of testimonies, from several different points of view. A representative stated \\"the personal details of the soldiers quoted in the collection, and the exact location of the incidents described in the testimonies, would readily be made available to any official and independent investigation of the events, as long as the identity of the testifiers did not become public.\\" A soldier who described using Gazans as human shields told in an interview to Haaretz that he had not seen Palestinians being used as human shields but had been told by his commanders that this occurred. In response to the report, a dozen English-speaking reservists who served in Gaza delivered signed, on-camera counter-testimonies via the SoldiersSpeakOut group, about Hamas' \\"use of Gazans as human shields and the measures the IDF took to protect Arab civilians\\". The special report by Israeli filmmaker Nurit Kedar shown on Channel 4 detailed similar allegations by former IDF soldiers that included vandalism and misconduct by Israeli troops. Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, in his address to the UNHRC asserted that during the conflict, the Israel Defense Forces \\"did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare\\" and that Palestinian civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas' way of fighting, which involved using human shields as a matter of policy, and deliberate attempts to sacrifice their own civilians. He added that Israel took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas and aborted potentially effective missions in order to prevent civilian casualties. =Prosecutions= The first Israeli soldier to be prosecuted for actions committed during the war was a Givati Brigade soldier who stole a Visa credit card from a Palestinian home and used it to withdraw NIS 1,600 ($405). He was arrested and tried before the Southern Command Military Court on charges of looting, credit card fraud, and indecent conduct. He was found guilty and sentenced to seven and a half months in military prison.\\"Soldier who stole credit card during Gaza op jailed\\". Ynetnews (1995-06-20). Retrieved on 2011-06-18. In a report submitted to the UN in January 2010, the IDF stated that two senior officers were disciplined for authorizing an artillery attack in violation of rules against their near populated areas. Several artillery shells hit the UNRWA compound in Tel al-Hawa.\\"Gaza operation investigations: An update\\", Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, January 2010, para. 100, page 29 During the attack on 15 January 2009, the compound was set ablaze by white phosphorus shells. The officers involved were identified as Gaza Division Commander Brigadier-General Eyal Eisenberg and Givati Brigade Commander Colonel Ilan Malka.\\"Israel reprimands top officers over UN compound strike\\", BBC News, 1 February 2010 An IDF internal investigation concluded that the firing of the shells violated the IDF orders limiting the use of artillery fire near populated areas and endangered human life. IDF sources added later that the shells had been fired to create cover to assist in the extrication of IDF troops, some of whom were wounded, from an area where Hamas held a superior position. An Israeli Government spokesman stated that in this particular case they had found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing and so had not referred the case to criminal investigation. In October 2010, Colonel Ilan Malka was interrogated by Israeli military police over the Zeitoun incident, and a criminal investigation was opened. Malka was suspected of authorizing an airstrike on a building that left numerous members of the Samouni family dead. His promotion to the rank of Brigadier-General was suspended due to the investigation. Malka told investigatiors that he was unaware of the presence of civilians. He was eventually reprimanded over the incident, but it was decided not to indict him. No other charges were brought over this incident. The IDF denied that they were targeting civilians and The New York Times reported that Hamas members had launched rockets at Israel about a mile away from the residents, an area \\"known to have many supporters of Hamas\\". The Palestinian Center for Human Rights called the result \\"disgraceful\\" and Btselem stated the need for an external investigator to look into IDF actions during Cast Lead. In June 2010, Chief Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit summoned a recently discharged Givati Brigade sniper for a special hearing. The soldier was suspected of opening fire on Palestinian civilians when a group of 30 Palestinians that included women and children waving a white flag, approached an IDF position. The incident, which occurred on 4 January 2009, resulted in the death of a non-combatant. Mandelblit decided to indict the soldier on a charge of manslaughter, despite contradictory testimony and the fact that IDF investigators could not confirm that the soldier was responsible for the death. In July 2010, the officer who authorized the airstrike on the Ibrahim al-Maqadna Mosque was subjected to disciplinary action, as shrapnel caused \\"unintentional injuries\\" to civilians inside. The IDF said that the officer \\"failed to exercise appropriate judgement\\", and that he would not be allowed to serve in similar positions of command in the future. Another Israeli officer was also reprimanded for allowing a Palestinian man to enter a building to persuade Hamas militants sheltering inside to leave. In November 2010, two Givati Brigade Staff Sergeants were convicted by the Southern Command Military Court of using a Palestinian boy as a human shield. The soldiers had been accused of forcing nine-year-old Majed R. at gunpoint to open bags suspected of containing bombs in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood. Both soldiers were demoted one rank and given three-month suspended sentences. According to the U.S. State Department's 2010 Human Rights Report, the Military Advocate General investigated over 150 wartime incidents, including those mentioned in the Goldstone Report. As of July, the Military Advocate General launched 47 criminal investigations into the conduct of IDF personnel, and completed a significant number of those. On 1 April 2011, Judge Richard Goldstone, the lead author of the UN report on the conflict, published a piece in The Washington Post titled 'Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes'. Goldstone noted that the subsequent investigations conducted by Israel \\"indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy\\" while \\"the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying.\\" He further expressed regret \\"that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes.\\" The other principal authors of the UN report, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers, have rejected Goldstone's reassessment arguing that there is \\"no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict\\". Effects Destroyed buildings in Gaza City, January 2009 Along with a high casualty rate, there were multiple economic, industrial and medical effects of the Gaza War. The United Nations Development Programme warned that there will be long-term consequences of the attacks on Gaza because the livelihoods and assets of tens of thousands of Gaza civilians have been affected. Early estimates by independent contractors in Gaza say that Gaza lost nearly $2 billion in assets, including 4,000 homes destroyed.\\"Gaza 'looks like earthquake zone'\\", BBC News, 19 January 2009. The IDF destroyed 600–700 factories, small industries, workshops and business enterprises throughout the Gaza Strip, 24 mosques, 31 security compounds, and 10 water or sewage lines. The World Health Organization said that 34 health facilities (8 hospitals and 26 primary health care clinics) were damaged over the course of the offensive and the UNOCHA said that over 50 United Nations facilities sustained damage, of which 28 reported damage in the first three days of the operation. On 22 January 2010, Israel paid $10.5 million in compensation to the United Nations for damages to UN property incurred during the Israeli offensive.\\"Israel compensates UN for damages during last year's Gaza offensive\\". United Nations. Retrieved on 2011-06-18. A satellite-based damage assessment of the Gaza Strip by the United Nations revealed 2,692 destroyed and severely damaged buildings, 220 impact craters on roads and bridges with an estimated length of 167 km (104 mi) of paved and unpaved roads damaged, 714 impact craters on open ground or cultivated land with an estimated land area of 2,100 hectares (21 km2), 187 greenhouses completely destroyed or severely damaged with an estimated area of 28 hectares (0.28 km2), and 2,232 hectares (22.32 km2) of demolished zones targeted by IDF bulldozers, tanks and phosphorus shelling. =Health problems in Gaza= Following the war, Gaza has witnessed increasing epidemics of health problems. At the Al Shifa hospital a constant increase in the percentage of children born with birth defects of about 60% was witnessed when the period of July to September 2008 was compared to the same period in 2009. Dr. Mohammed Abu Shaban, director of the Blood Tumors Department in Al-Rantisy Hospital in Gaza has witnessed an increase in the number of cases of blood cancer. In March 2010 the department had seen 55 cases so far for that year, compared to the 20 to 25 cases normally seen in an entire year. During the war, Norwegian medics said that they had found traces of depleted uranium, a radioactive and genotoxic material used in some types of munition, in some Gaza residents who were wounded. Lawyers who brought back soil samples from Gaza said that areas where these samples were taken contained up to 75 tons of depleted uranium. The Israeli government denied it used Depleted Uranium, and the United Nations opened an investigation. Israel had also initially denied the use of white phosphorus during the war, but later acknowledged that indeed it had used white phosphorus to cover troop movements. The policy of the Government of Israel is to condition the access of Palestinians who live in the Palestinian territories to healthcare in Israel upon financial coverage from the Palestinian Authority. In January 2009, following the war, the Palestinian Authority cancelled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for chronically ill Palestinian patients, and those in need of complex care that is not available in other tertiary medical centers in the region. This decision was protested by human rights organizations.\\"Physicians for Human Rights-Israel and human rights organizations in a joint position paper on the decision to stop covering Palestinian's medical care in Israel\\".

February 2009 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that the Gaza humanitarian crisis is significant and should not be understated. It also states that the situation is a \\"human dignity crisis\\" in the Gaza strip, entailing \\"a massive destruction of livelihoods and a significant deterioration of infrastructure and basic services\\". Fear and panic are widespread; 80% of the population could not support themselves and were dependent on humanitarian assistance. The International Red Cross said the situation was \\"intolerable\\" and a \\"full blown humanitarian crisis\\". The importation of necessary food and supplies continues to be blocked even after the respective ceasefires. According to the World Food Programme, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization and Palestinian officials, between 35% and 60% of the agriculture industry was wrecked. With extensive damage occurring to water sources, greenhouses, and farmland. It is estimated that 60% of the agricultural land in the north of the Strip may no longer be arable. More than 50,800 Gazans were left homeless. Extensive destruction was caused to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure. According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. They accounted as part of the 3% of industrial capacity that was operating after the Israeli blockade was imposed, which was mostly destroyed during the operation. On 3 January before the IDF ground operation, Israel's foreign minister Tzipi Livni said that Israel had taken care to protect the civilian population of Gaza, and that it had kept the humanitarian situation \\"completely as it should be\\", maintaining Israel's earlier stance. The Secretary-general of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, criticized Livni's statement and further criticized the Security Council for not responding faster to the crisis. On subsequent reports, the UN stated that \\"only an immediate cease- fire will be able to address the large-scale humanitarian and protection crisis that faces the people of Gaza.\\" The Emergency Relief Coordinator of the United Nations has stated that after the end of the Israeli operation, at best, only 120 truckloads get into Gaza, instead of the normal daily requirement, including commercial traffic, of 500 trucks at minimum. It is also reported in his statement and other UN humanitarian office reports that essential items such as construction materials, water pipes, electrical wires, and transformers continue to be effectively banned, or only allowed infrequently. He also stated that commercial goods must be allowed in and out, since Gaza Palestinians \\"do not want or deserve to be dependent on humanitarian aid\\" and that the \\"limited trickle\\" of items into Gaza continue the effective collective punishment of the civilian population and force the counter-productive reliance on tunnels for daily essentials. Tent camp, Gaza Strip, April 2009 As a result of the conflict, the European Union, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and over 50 nations donated humanitarian aid to Gaza, including the United States, which donated over $20 million.Elise Labott, U.S. to give $20 million more in humanitarian aid to Gaza. CNN. 26-01-2009 On 7 January a UN Relief Works Agency spokesman acknowledged that he was \\"aware of instances where deliveries of humanitarian aid into Gaza\\" were diverted by the Hamas government, though never from his agency. Additionally, on 3 February, blankets and food parcels were confiscated by Hamas police personnel from an UNRWA distribution center, and on 4 February, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator demanded that the aid be returned immediately. The Hamas government issued a statement stating that the incident was a misunderstanding between the drivers of the trucks and has been resolved through direct contact with the UNRWA. On 9 February, UNRWA lifted the suspension on the movement of its humanitarian supplies into Gaza, after the Hamas authorities returned all the aid supplies confiscated. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has described the Israeli procedures for humanitarian organizations entrance to Gaza as inconsistent and unpredictable ones that impedes the ability of organizations to effectively plan their humanitarian response and obstructs efforts to address the humanitarian crisis brought by the 18 months blockade and Israel's military operation. The UN also reported that international organizations faced \\"unprecedented denial\\" of access to Gaza by Israel since 5 November and that humanitarian access remained unreliable and needed to be granted on an unrestricted daily basis. Destroyed buildings in Gaza In a damage assessment by the World Health Organization, 48% of the 122 health facilities assessed were found to be damaged or destroyed, 15 of Gaza's 27 hospitals and 41 primary health care centers suffered damage, and 29 ambulances were partially damaged or destroyed. Injured patients needing referral outside Gaza for specialized care were evacuated exclusively through the Egyptian Rafah border crossing. In the early stages of the conflict, Hamas sealed the border, and prevented wounded Palestinians from seeking medical attention in Egypt. On 30 December, the organization allowed a trickle of medical evacuations from Gaza, but restricted their number. Gaza Ministry of Health reported that between 29 December and 22 January 608 injured were evacuated through Rafah. The Israeli Erez crossing was closed much of the period and only 30 patients were able to exit during the crisis. An initial survey conducted by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates that 14,000 homes, 68 government buildings, and 31 non-governmental organization offices (NGOs) were either totally or partially damaged, creating about 600,000 tonnes of concrete rubble needing to be removed. Since 2007, Israel has not permitted the entry of construction material into Gaza, adversely affecting UN projects, in particular UNRWA and UNDP, who suspended more than $100 million in construction projects due to lack of materials. The Israeli Health Ministry and Magen David Adom established an emergency clinic for wounded Gazans at the Erez crossing on 17 June. The clinic received only patients, none of them with war-related injuries, and it was suspected that Hamas had instructed civilians not to seek treatment there. The clinic closed after ten days. Subsequently, the Jordanian Army established a field hospital in the Gaza Strip, which is still operating. The hospital's equipment, staff, and military guards are transferred from Jordan through Israel via the Allenby Bridge, and outgoing personnel return the same way.\\"Israeli Convoy Delivers Medical Supplies to Gaza\\" IDF Blog: The Official Blog of the Israel Defense Forces, 13 June 2011 One year after the ceasefire approximately 20,000 people remained displaced. =Effects on Israel= HRW, during the Gaza War, rocket attacks placed up to 800,000 people within range of attack.

The Manufacturers Association of Israel estimated the direct cost to business and industry to be 88 million NIS, and indirect financial losses at several tens of millions of shekels.\\"Manufacturers claim Cast Lead cost industry nearly NIS 90m\\".

International law Accusations of violations regarding international humanitarian law, which governs the actions by belligerents during an armed conflict, have been directed at both Israel and Hamas for their actions during the Gaza War. The accusations covered violating laws governing distinction and proportionality by Israel, the indiscriminate firing of rockets at civilian locations and extrajudicial violence within the Gaza Strip by Hamas. As of September 2009, some 360 complaints had been filed by individuals and NGOs at the prosecutor's office in the Hague calling for investigations into alleged crimes committed by Israel during the Gaza War. On 15 September 2009, a 574-page report by UN inquiry team was released, officially titled \\"Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict\\". It concluded that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.\\"Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict\\", UN Fact Finding Mission, 15 September 2009 On 16 October 2009, the UN Human Rights Council endorsed the report. Israel's Defense Minister said that the report was distorted, falsified and not balanced. Human rights organizations have urged both Israel and Hamas to implement an independent investigation into the alleged violations of international law as stipulated by the Goldstone report.\\"Human rights community to Israeli Prime Minister: Time is running out. Establish independent inquiry into Operation Cast Lead\\" B'tselem. 26 January 2010 On 1 April 2011, Goldstone wrote an op-ed that appeared in The Washington Post in which he stated that he no longer believes the report's finding that Israel targeted Palestinian civilians as a matter of policy, the most serious accusation the report made against Israel.Goldstone, Richard. Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes The Washington Post. 1 April 2011 The three other signatories to the UNHRC report, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers, co-authored an op-ed that appeared in The Guardian in which they replied that there was no evidence that refutes any of the report's findings.Ed Pilkington, Conal Urquhart. Gaza report authors rebuke Goldstone Sydney Morning Herold. 16 April 2011 In April 2012, the International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected the Palestinian Authority's (PA) request that Israel be investigated for claimed war crimes in Gaza in 2009, holding that since the PA is recognized by the UN General Assembly as an \\"observer\\" rather than a \\"state\\", the ICC lacked jurisdiction to hear its request. The decision was heavily criticized by human rights groups. Media Photojournalists during the conflict International news networks named the conflict \\"War in Gaza\\" and focused on the assault. Israeli media called it the \\"War in the South\\" ( Milẖama BaDarom) and dispatched reporters to Israeli towns hit by rockets. Al Jazeera suggested that it was a war against Palestinian civilians with the title \\"War on Gaza\\". = Denied media access = Reporter access to the war zone was limited. During the Gaza raids against Hamas, the Israeli army denied international media access to the conflict zone, against a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court to lift the embargo.. AFP, 6 February 2009. The Foreign Press Association of Israel released a statement saying, \\"The unprecedented denial of access to Gaza for the world's media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of Israel in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs.\\" = Attacks on the media = Media facilities in Gaza, both foreign and domestic, came under Israeli fire in the military campaign. On one occasion a Grad rocket may have been launched from a location near the television studios in the Al-Shuruk tower in Gaza City. Although the Israeli recording of a reporter describing a rocket launch was during the initial aerial bombardment phase the tower was only bombed in the final few days. On 29 December the IDF destroyed the facilities and headquarters of Al-Aqsa TV (though broadcasts continue from elsewhere), and a week later, IDF soldiers entered the building and seized the equipment. The Israelis also hacked into the station's signal and broadcast an animated clip of Hamas' leadership being gunned down. On 5 January the IDF bombed the offices of the Hamas-affiliated Al-Risala newsweekly. On 9 January the IDF hit the Johara tower of Gaza City, which houses more than 20 international news organizations, including Turkish, French, and Iranian outlets. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that the building had not been targeted, though it may have sustained damage from a nearby Israeli strike. On 12 January two Arab journalists from Jerusalem working for an Iranian television station were arrested by Israeli Police and indicted in the Jerusalem District Court for violating military censorship protocols. They had reported on the IDF ground offensive hours before they were cleared to do so. The journalists maintained that they merely stated what was already being said in the international media. = New media = Media relations also played an important role, with the use of new media (up to and including cyber warfare) on the part of both Israel and Hamas. Haaretz reported that Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni \\"instructed senior ministry officials to open an aggressive and diplomatic international public relations campaign to gain support for Israel Defense Forces operations in the Gaza Strip\\". Israeli officials at embassies and consulates worldwide have mounted campaigns in local media, and to that end have recruited people who speak the native language. Israel has also opened an international media centre in Sderot. To improve Israeli public relations, the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption has recruited 1,000 volunteers with the objective of flooding news websites and blogs that the ministry term as anti- Israeli with pro-Israeli opinions. Volunteers proficient in languages other than Hebrew were particularly sought after. Foreign Press Branch head Avital Leibovich believes the \\"new media\\" is another war zone, stating, \\"We have to be relevant there.\\" As part of its public-relations campaign, the Israeli army opened a YouTube channel \\"through which it will disseminate footage of precision bombing operations in the Gaza Strip, as well as aid distribution and other footage of interest to the international community\\". Reactions Protest against the war in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Protest against the war in London, UK. While Israel defined its operation as a war against Hamas, Palestinian representatives and individuals, among others, viewed it as a \\"war on the Palestinian people\\". The United Nations Security Council issued a statement on 28 December 2008, calling \\"for an immediate halt to all violence\\". The Arab League, the European Union and many nations made similar calls. On 9 January 2009, following an earlier, failed attempt at a ceasefire resolution, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1860 calling for \\"an immediate, durable and fully respected cease-fire\\" leading to a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to Gaza arms smuggling, by 14 votes to one abstention (the United States). The resolution was ignored by both Israel and Hamas. Governmental proclamations regarding the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict Many governments expressed positions on the conflict, most condemning both belligerents, or neither of them. Thirty-four states, mostly members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, condemned Israel's attacks exclusively. Three of them expressed support for Hamas' operations or defined them as falling within its right of resistance. Nineteen states, mostly members of the European Union, condemned Hamas' attacks exclusively. Thirteen of them expressed support for Israel's operations or defined them as falling within Israel's right to self-defense. Bolivia, Jordan, Mauritania and Venezuela significantly downscaled or severed their relations with Israel in protest of the offensive. The conflict saw worldwide civilian demonstrations for and against both sides.\\"Major cities stage fresh protests over Gaza\\", AFP 11-01-2009 The conflict triggered a wave of reprisal attacks against Jewish targets in Europe and elsewhere.Philippe Naughton, \\"Gaza conflict fuels anti- Semitic attacks across Europe\\", Times Online 06-01-2009 The worldwide number of recorded antisemitic incidents during the conflict more than tripled the number of such incidents in the same period of the previous year, marking a two-decade high. The British government reviewed its export licenses to Israel for violations of EU and national arms export control laws and revoked five export licenses for replacement parts and other equipment for Sa'ar 4.5 missile boats used by Israel because they were used in the Gaza offensive, although 16 export licenses for other British defense items to Israel were approved.

He was shot and severely wounded by an emergency response team member as he attempted to flee. His actions were suspected of being a reprisal for Israel's attack. The worker had been employed in the city for about 10 years with no previous trouble, but had spoken out against the war shortly before his rampage. =Reactions in Israel= Tel-Aviv University students demonstrate in support for operation \\"Cast Lead\\" and the citizens of south Israel. The war provoked mixed reactions inside Israel, with the Jewish majority largely supporting it, and the Arab minority mostly opposing it. A poll taken on 8 January 2009 showed that 91% of the Jewish public supported the war, and 4% opposed it, while a separate poll conducted 4–6 January showed a 94% approval of the war among Jews and 85% disapproval among Israeli Arabs.המכון למחקרי ביטחון לאומי > Publications > Periodicals.

Within hours of the war's start, the Higher Follow-Up Committee for Arab citizens of Israel met in Nazareth, and declared a \\"day of wrath and mourning for the martyrs among our compatriots in the Gaza Strip\\", and a general strike for the following day. Arab demonstrations took place across the country almost every day during the offensive, and were described as the \\"largest Arab demonstrations in Israel's history\\". Arab parties and parliamentarians in the Knesset also opposed the offensive.\\"The Palestinians in Israel and Operation Cast Lead: A view from Haifa\\". palestine-studies.org \\"Mass protests held against Gaza war\\". Al Jazeera (2009-01-11). Retrieved on 2011-06-18. In Jerusalem, Arabs held violent demonstrations, which included rock-throwing, arson, and the vandalization of Jewish graves. Police arrested dozens of rioters. At the University of Haifa, Tel Aviv University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jewish leftist and Arab students staged anti- war demonstrations, which were met with pro-war counter-demonstrations. Some confrontations occurred despite police keeping protesters apart. The legal rights agency Adalah produced a report highly critical of the Israeli police and court system's response to the opposition to Operation Cast Lead. The report said that the Israeli authorities had shown a lack of tolerance for protests, and had damaged the freedom of expression of those opposing the attacks on Gaza. The report said that the actions showed the lessons of the Or Commission had not been learned. The Israeli Ministry of Justice responded that the risk to human life and public welfare had justified their actions. The term Sderot cinema has been coined for the tradition of residents in Sderot sitting to view the bombardment of the Gaza strip.

Background  Zheng Yuqing was born in 777, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Zheng Prefecture (鄭州, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) and claimed ancestry from the royal house of the Spring and Autumn period state Zheng. It also traced its ancestry to a line of officials of Han Dynasty, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Former Yan or Later Yan, Northern Wei, Northern Zhou, and Tang Dynasty.New Book of Tang, vol. 75. His grandfather Zheng Changyu () served as the deputy principal of the imperial university and later a prefectural prefect, while his father Zheng Ciming () served as a staff member of the crown prince.Old Book of Tang, vol. 158 .Zheng Yuqing's biography in the Old Book of Tang gave his father's name as Zheng Ci (鄭慈); the name Zheng Ciming was per the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 158 with New Book of Tang, vol. 75. Zheng Yuqing himself was said to be studious and diligent in his youth. In the middle of the Dali era (766-779) era of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, he passed the imperial examinations.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Toward the end of the Jianzhong era (780-783) of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Yan Zhen () the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) invited Zheng Yuqing to serve as an assistant.Yan Zhen was made the military governor of Shannan West Circuit in 782 and appeared to serve there until his death in 799, although the Jianzhong era ended in 783, so Zheng's service under Yan must have been in 782 and/or 783. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 117 . Zheng later left governmental service to observe a period of mourning when his father died. Early in Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan era (785-805), Zheng was recalled to the capital Chang'an and served successively as Bingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of defense (兵部, Bingbu); and Kubu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of census (戶部, Hubu). In 792, he was made an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi). In 797, he was made the deputy minister of public works (工部侍郎, Gongbu Shilang) but was also put in charge of selecting officials at the ministry of civil service (吏部, Libu). While he was serving there, there was an incident where a Buddhist monk by the dharma name of Facou (), who had been ordered back into civilian life by the county magistrate Lu Boda () after he was accused of misconduct by the other monks, became a monk again despite that order. When Lu reported this to Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong ordered that a tribunal be convened that would include the deputy chief imperial censor Yuwen Miao (), the deputy minister of justice Zhang Yu (), the chief judge of the supreme court Zheng Yunkui (), and a supervisor from the ministry of Buddhist and Taoist affairs, Zhuge Shu (). Zheng found this tribunal to be inappropriate — as Zhuge was a low-level official who lacked the standing of the three key officials and, in Zheng's opinion, should not share places on the same tribunal — and he submitted a written opposition. This caused Zheng to gain a good reputation. In 798, Zheng was made Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. It was said that because Zheng was well-versed in the Five Classics, he often invoked ancient precedents while making suggestions to the emperor. In 800, however, he incurred Emperor Dezong's displeasure due to two matters — he was friendly with the director of finances Yu Pi (name not in Unicode) and therefore often advised Emperor Dezong to accept Yu's suggestions, causing Emperor Dezong to believe that they were conspiring; and at that time, due to a drought, Emperor Dezong and the chancellors were discussing issuing a special stipend to the imperial guard soldiers, but Zheng's assistant leaked the news before the discussion was finalized. As a result, Zheng was exiled to serve as the military advisor to the prefect of Chen Prefecture (郴州, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan), while Yu was exiled to be the census officer at Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian).  During Emperor Shunzong's, Emperor Xianzong's, and Emperor Muzong's reigns  Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shunzong. Emperor Shunzong immediately issued an edict several important officials that Emperor Dezong had exiled — Zheng Yuqing, Lu Zhi, Han Gao (), and Yang Cheng () (although Lu and Yang died before the edict could reach them).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. Zheng was made Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). Later in the year, after Emperor Shunzong, who was seriously ill, passed the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong, Zheng was again made chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. In 806, when Yang Huilin () the nephew of Han Quanyi () the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (夏綏, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), seized the circuit after Han was recalled to Chang'an, Emperor Xianzong was discussing with the chancellors how to react. When Zheng submitted suggestions, he invoked an ancient saying that stated that soldiers of Xiasui's capital prefecture Xia Prefecture relied on county officials, which confused the other officials, and they believed that while Zheng was scholarly in ancient matters that he did not have skills to deal with the current emergency. Further, at that time, there was a senior secretary at the legislative bureau, Hua Huan (), who was closely associating with the powerful eunuch Liu Guangqi () such that whatever Hua suggested, due to his seniority and powerful connections, the other chancellors Du You and Zheng Yin would usually not dare to oppose it. Zheng, however, was displeased that Hua was overstepping his authorities and rebuked him. As a result, Zheng was removed from his chancellor position in summer 806 and made an advisor to the crown prince.However, since there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary. However, when Hua was found to be corrupt later that year and executed, Emperor Dezong, finding out that Zheng had rebuked Hua previously, was pleased with Zheng and made him Guozi Jijiu (), the principal of the imperial university, and soon made him the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the eastern capital Luoyang). In 808, Zheng was made the defender of Luoyang. It was said that because both times that Zheng was removed from his chancellor position were not due to major faults of his, his opinion continued to carry great weight. Around that time, there was an incident where the officials Yuan Yifang () and Lu Tan () both requested to have ceremonial ji placed at their gates, and both requests were approved, even though such honors were then reserved for officials of greater accomplishment. When Zheng visited Chang'an and expressed the opinion that such decorations were inappropriate, the officials who approved the requests, Lu Ze () and Cui Bei () were both fined, and the ji were removed from Yuan and Lu's gates. In 811, when Emperor Xianzong's crown prince Li Ning died,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Emperor Xianzong put Zheng in charge of drafting a mourning text for Li Ning, and it was said that Zheng wrote appropriately. Around that time, a physician named Cui Huan () was given a promotion from being a low-level military officer to be the military advisor to a prefect. Zheng vehemently opposed, believing that it was too great of a promotion for someone who did not have great contributions. His words were so stern that they offended the officials in power at the time, and he was made an advisor to the new crown prince Li Heng, also acting at the minister of worship (太常卿, Taichang Qing). While serving there, he restored the use of drums in the palace music. (The use of drums had been discontinued since the rebellions of Zhu Ci and Li Huaiguang during Emperor Dezong's reign, to avoid alarming the people of Chang'an.) In 814, Zheng was made the military governor of Shannan West Circuit as well as the mayor of its capital Xingyuan Municipality (). In 817, he was recalled to Chang'an to again serve as Li Heng's advisor, and soon he requested to retire; Emperor Xianzong declined. Around that time, because Emperor Xianzong had issued multiple mass promotions of officials, it was said that high ranks were becoming overly granted. Emperor Xianzong had Zheng draft regulations that would reduce the excessive promotions. In 818, Zheng was made Zuo Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau. It was said that for a long time, there had not been appropriate officials serving as the heads of the executive bureau, and that after Zheng was named to that post, the people were impressed. As Zheng was familiar with old regulations, Emperor Xianzong also put him in charge of revising the regulations on the rites. Later, Zheng was made the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital, Fengxiang Municipality. In 819, Zheng was again made an advisor to Li Heng, as well as acting Sikong (司空, one of the Three Excellencies). He was also created the Duke of Yingyang and made acting principal of the imperial university. At that time, the facilities of the imperial university had long been in disrepair, and at Zheng's request, its facilities at Chang'an and Luoyang were repaired. In 820, Emperor Xianzong died, and Li Heng succeeded him (as Emperor Muzong). Emperor Muzong, as Zheng had long served him, particularly honored him. Zheng died around the new year 821 and was given posthumous honors. It was said that Zheng was frugal and honest throughout his official career, and that at the time of death, he lacked savings. Emperor Muzong thus gave a special stipend to his family members to honor Zheng. Zheng's grandson Zheng Congdang later served as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xizong.

After being released from Smedsbo he began working as a metal worker in Sweden from August 1943. Political career in the GDR After the end of the Second World War, he returned to Germany. During 1946 he was a co-founder, together with Hermann Axen and Erich Honecker, of the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ), In 1958 Verner became a candidate member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) politburo. He was also one of the secretaries of the party Central Committee. In March 1959 Verner became First Secretary of the Berlin district organization of SED, a powerful institution in the GDR. At the time the party district included West Berlin. Verner received criticism for the dismal performance of the party in West Berlin. Under Verner's leadership the West Berlin organizations were separated from the SED in 1961 (and would become the Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin). Verner became a full Politburo member in 1963.The Sed Leadership After the Sixth Party Congress For most of the 1970s and early 1980s, he was the second-ranking member of the SED hierarchy, and de facto the second most powerful man in the country after party leader Erich Honecker. He died in Berlin in 1986.

Until 1794 the city belonged to the Duchy of Jülich. After the Congress of Vienna in 1814 Kaldenkirchen lay within the borders of Prussia. In In 1856 King Frederick William IV of Prussia permitted the use of “town” for this city. 1903 the German Emperor Wilhelm II permitted the city arms. The synagogue was destroyed during the Kristallnacht. The city was evacuated during the last weeks of the Second World War. In 1947 a fire destroyed 90% of the surrounding forest. In 1961 Kaldenkirchen had a population of 6305, 23% of whom were refugees.

The society was founded in 1997 to provide a stable financial home for the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference and has grown to become a larger society working towards advancing understanding of living systems through computation and for communicating scientific advances worldwide. In addition to ISMB, the society also organizes a growing number of smaller, more regionally or topically focused conferences and presents a number of annual scientific achievement awards, including the Overton Prize and the ISCB Senior Scientist Awards.http://www.iscb.org/iscb- awards/accomplishment-senior-scientist-award Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award Overview Society membership reflects commitment toward the advancement of computational biology. The ISCB is an international non-profit organization whose members come from the global bioinformatics and computational biology communities. The ISCB serves its global membership by providing high-quality meetings, publications, and reports on methods and tools; by disseminating key information about bioinformatics resources and relevant news from related fields; and by actively facilitating training, education, employment, career development, and networking. The society also advocates and provides leadership for resources and policies in support of scientific endeavors and to benefit society at large. ISCB seeks to communicate the significance of computational biology to the larger scientific community, to governmental organizations, and to the general public; the society serves its members locally, nationally, and internationally; it provides guidance for scientific policies, publications, meetings, and distributes information through multiple platforms. ISCB organizes the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference every year, a growing number of smaller, more regionally or topically focused annual and bi- annual conferences, and has three official journals: ISCB Community Journal, PLOS Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. The society awards three scientific achievement awards annually: the Overton Prize, the ISCB Innovator Award, and the ISCB Senior Scientist Awards. The society elects ISCB Fellows annually, to honor members that have distinguished themselves through outstanding contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. The ISCB also awards the ISCB Outstanding Contributions Award to recognize members of the community who have significantly contributed to the success of the organization. HistoryFounding= The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series began in 1993. As a response to the expansion of the conference, the ISCB was founded in 1997 with a significant part of its remit being to provide a stable financial home for ISMB. The ISCB was legally incorporated in early 1997, with Lawrence Hunter elected as its inaugural president by the members of the founding board of directors, which included Russ Altman, Philip Bourne, David States and Alfonso Valencia. The ISCB has organized the ISMB conference since 1998. During the next few years the focus remained on management of the annual ISMB conference, whose 1993 attendance of approximately 200 researchers had more than tripled by 1999. The new millennium brought in a new president in Russ Altman, currently chair of Stanford University's department of bioengineering and director of the program in biomedical informatics, and over 1,200 delegates attended ISMB 2000 in San Diego. Altman took steps to formalize some of the legal and administrative aspects of ISCB before passing the torch in 2002 to Philip E. Bourne, currently professor in the department of pharmacology and Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California, San Diego. Bourne gave ISCB a more permanent home at UCSD, which included the university's commitment to host the society through at least 2005 and its offer of staff support. Although Bourne served as president for only one year, he left his mark on the society by increasing the interaction with regional groups and conference organizers worldwide, and through an improved web presence. During his tenure, membership grew to more than 1,700 researchers, and the 2002 ISMB conference in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada welcomed over 1,600 attendees. =Expansion= Michael Gribskov, then at UCSD's San Diego Supercomputer department and now at the department of biological sciences at Purdue University, was elected president in 2003. That year ISMB took place in Brisbane, Australia, which was the first time the meeting was held outside North America or Europe. This phase brought many uncertainties for the society when attendance dropped to one half of budgeted expectations due to travel fears and restrictions related to outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS, the start of the war in Iraq, and the location, which broke with the pattern of North American and European venues. Although scientifically successful, the financial losses of ISMB 2003 left ISCB financially unstable for the first time in its history. In part to reduce ISCB's dependence on ISMB proceeds to fund the society's activities and annual overhead costs, a pilot regional conference was hosted in the US to gauge interest in smaller, localized meetings. In December 2003, the Rocky Mountain Regional Bioinformatics conference, Rocky 1, was launched in Aspen, Colorado. The meeting has been held annually ever since and now attracts attendees from around the world. In 2005, as part of the society's discussions about the role of publications and the society's official journal, accompanied by the advent of open access publishing, the ISCB announced a partnership with the Public Library of Science and launched a new open access journal, PLoS Computational Biology. The journal is intended to emphasize computational methods applied to living systems at all scales, from molecular biology to patient populations and ecosystems, and which offer insight for experimentalists. Past president and past publications committee chair Phil Bourne served as the new publication's editor-in-chief and he remains in that role. The first issue of the new journal coincided with the opening day of ISMB 2005, held in Detroit, Michigan. Burkhard Rost, then professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia University and now the Alexander von Humboldt Professor and chair of bioinformatics and computational biology, computational sciences at the Technical University Munich, succeeded Michael Gribskov as president in 2007 and has been reelected twice with a current term expiration set for January 2013. Under his tenure the ISMB/ECCB 2007 conference in Vienna, Austria, chaired by Thomas Lengauer of the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, and co-chaired by Burkhard Rost and Peter Schuster of the University of Vienna, was further expanded to include a total of eight parallel tracks, and the 2007 conference attendance of approximately 1,700 was back on track with expectations. Vienna as a destination and the Austria Center Vienna were both so well received by the conference organizers and attendees alike that it was selected to host the 2011 conference as well, which is a first for the ISMB series that had never before repeated a location. In 2010 the first ISCB Latin America was held in Montevideo, Uruguay. Leadership and Structure A president, an executive committee, and a board of directors comprise ISCB's scientific leadership, drawing on distinguished, internationally renowned researchers who are elected for their term by the general society membership. The executive director leads the ISCB staff and supports a diverse set of committees dedicated to specific issues that are important to the computational biology and bioinformatics community, including education, policy, and publications. =PresidentsBoard of Directors= , notable members of the board of directors include: Alex Bateman, Bonnie Berger, Terry Gaasterland, Janet Kelso, Thomas Lengauer, Yves Moreau, Christine Orengo, Burkhard Rost, Alfonso Valencia and Martin Vingron. =Fellows= The ISCB has elected Fellows since 2009. These distinctions are awarded in honour of outstanding contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. The inaugural Class was given to previous recipients of the ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award; in following years, the ISCB has sought nominations for Fellows from its members. Fellows are traditionally introduced at the ISCB's flagship Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference each year. As of the Class of 2017, 64 Fellows have been elected. =Communities of Special Interest (COSIs)= ISCB Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) are member communities of shared interest that have self-organized and have multiple activities or interactions throughout the year, rather than solely meeting during the SIG program of the ISMB conference. An important goal of any COSI is to foster a topically- focused collaborative community wherein scientists communicate with one another on research problems and/or opportunities in specific areas of computational biology. Such communication is often in the form of meetings, but can also be through other social media tools that allow for vibrant participation in a virtual environment. =Student Council= In 2004, the ISCB Student Council was founded by Manuel Corpas to promote the development of a worldwide community for computational biology students. One of the main roles of the student council is to promote soft skills in order to develop potential in bioinformatics and computational biology trainees. , the student council represents more than 1,000 students worldwide. Conferences ISCB grew out of the need for a stable organizational structure to support the planning and manage the finances of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series, which had its start in 1993. ISMB is ISCB's most prominent annual activity, toward which a significant portion of resources are dedicated each year. Since 2004, when ISMB is held in Europe, it is held jointly with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB). ISCB began expanding its conference offerings with the introduction of the annual Rocky Mountain Bioinformatics Conference series in 2003, the Conference on Semantics in Healthcare and Life Sciences (CSHALS) in 2008, the bi-annual ISCB Africa ASBCB Bioinformatics Conference in 2009, and the bi-annual ISCB Latin America Conference in 2010. ISCB also hosts an annual Great Lake Bioinformatics Conference and partners with RECOMB to produce the Regulatory and Systems Genomics Conference with DREAM Challenges. The ISCB-Asia meeting was started in 2012 and continues to take shape after its last conference in 2014 in Japan in conjunction with GIW. In addition to ISCB-organized conferences, the society supports other computational biology and bioinformatics conferences through affiliations and sponsorships. These include the annual Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB), the annual international conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), the annual International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB), and the annual general meeting of the European Molecular Biology Network or EMBnet. Official journals * In 1998 Bioinformatics became the official journal of the ISCB. Dues-paying members of the society benefited from an online subscription to the journal. ISMB conference proceedings have been published in Bioinformatics since 2001. In 2004, as many ISCB members had institutional subscriptions to Bioinformatics, ISCB decided not to renew its contract with the journal. In January 2009 Bioinformatics again became an official journal of the ISCB, alongside PLOS Computational Biology. * PLOS Computational Biology is an open-access, peer-reviewed journal published monthly by the Public Library of Science (PLOS). It became an official journal of ISCB in 2005. * In 2015, ISCB announced the formation of the ISCB Community Journal, a dedicated channel on the F1000Research online publishing platform, providing members the opportunity to openly publish research articles regardless of their format or perceived impact. Affiliated organizations The ISCB has several affiliated organizations (mainly regional), including the European Molecular Biology Network (EMBnet), the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre (NBIC), the African Society for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and the Japanese Society for Bioinformatics. The ISCB is also a founding member of Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET). In collaboration with GOBLET, the ISCB is involved in developing core competencies for different types of bioinformatics trainees; these competencies are being used in the development of new bioinformatics curricula.

The park was originally established in 1966 to protect the various ecosystems and biodiversity as Lura National Park. The altitude vary from . The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the park as Category II. Nevertheless, it is described as an important Bird and Plant Area, because it supports significant bird and plant species. Geography In behalf to a great variability in elevation, Lurë-Dejës Mt National Park is densely populated in vegetation. Higher plant life consists mainly of both coniferous and deciduous trees, particularly around the shores of the lakes. The most common tree native to Lurë is the european beech along with silver fir, black pine, red pine and bosnian pine. Especially protected is the balkan pine, which is threatened with extinction and only common in the west of the Balkan Peninsula. The southern section of the park has a meadow of multicolour flowers and several coniferous trees, which is called the Field of Mares, offering pristine views over the landscape. In terms of phytogeography, the park falls within the Pindus Mountains mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. Flora and Fauna The park shelters numerous species. Most important wildlife inhabiting the park includes the european brown bear, eurasian lynx, eurasian wolf, european pine marten, roe deer and western capercaillie. Small mammals include the red squirrel and edible dormouse. The twelve glacial lakes within the national park were formed during the ice age. They are located in the northeastern part of the nation in the Dibër County at an elevation between . Each lake carries a name associated with its most characteristic feature. Zall Gjoçaj, part of the expanded park, is an intensively fissured and mountainous landscape with a great variety of natural features including valleys, glacial lakes and dense forests without human intervention. Elevations in the area vary from 600 metres to over 2,000 metres above the Adriatic. The geomorphological conditions of the region reflects the dynamic geological history, tectonic movements and erosive activity of the rivers flowing through the park. Most of the area is covered by a mixture of beech, fir, pine, ash and maple trees growing on limestone and dolomite. The park's woods are important because they provide shelter for numerous fauna. Most notable amongst them is the brown bear and grey wolf. Other large mammals include lynxes, roe deers and birds such as the golden eagle.National Park \\"Zall- Gjoçaj\\" According to Albanian poet Gjergj Fishta, \\"Him/her who has not seen Lura, he/she has not seen Albania\\", meanwhile British renowned traveler Edith Durham has been quoted as follows: \\"When I came up the Qafë Lurë, I saw such a beautiful field, that I had never seen in any place of the Balkans\\". Post communism However, following the fall of communism in the 1990s, the area suffered massive deforestation from illegal logging and forest fires that severely affected ecosystems. In fact, it is estimated that as much as 50% of the original Lura National Park has been destroyed. In 2014, the Government of Albania launched a controversial rehabilitation campaign including reforestation, roadwork, and the putting of new signs. Local stakeholders have criticized the project as merely superficial. In the meantime, local non- governmental organizations such as Ecovolis are trying to revitalize the park by planting of trees and removing debris around the lakes, some of which are drying up. Nature is also helping by naturally spreading seeds of new trees which are growing at different areas of the park. Accommodation consists of several family run hotels and guesthouses near the park in Fushe-Lure. The area around Lura features traditional tower houses, the once industrial mining town of Kurbnesh, Ottoman mosques, and a recently renovated Catholic Church. The region is also home to Albanian Independence signatory Dom Nikollë Kaçorri. In May 2002, Joseph Limprecht who served as the US Ambassador to Albania died from a heart attack, at the age of 55, while visiting Lure National Park.https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os- xpm-2002-05-20-0205200273-story.html Outlook In 2018, the park was expanded and renamed Lura-Mt Dejes National Park to include former Zall-Gjocaj National Park for a total coverage area of 20,242 ha. The Albanian government has outlined a plan that would turn the area into an agritourism hot-spot under the 100 Villages Initiative, consisting in the renovation of traditional tower houses, and the reconstruction of the road connecting the park with Rreshen and the A1 motorway. In 2019, a number of local NGOs such as Co-Plan and North Green Association in collaboration with local stakeholders planted 1000 new trees inside the protected area. Furthermore, a project called Trees for Lure hopes to plant 20 000 trees by 2020. However, the future of the expanded national park is being threatened by the construction of hydro electric power plants in Zall-Gjocaj that would further cripple the already fragile ecosystem of the area.https://balkanrivers.net/sites/default/files/Financing-hydropower- southeast-Europe-web-fin.pdf Gallery File:Liqeni_i_Kallabes,_Lura.jpgLiqeni i Kallabës File:Liqeni_i_lures.jpgLiqeni i Lurës File:Lurë_from_top_- _Mapillary_(Cb71KfUc-TyHmbgA0TAS8A).jpgLiqeni i Madh from the top File:Lurë_National_Park_-_Liqeni_i_Madh.jpgLiqeni i Madh File:Lura_Lakes_- _panoramio.jpgView of the lake File:Parku_Komb%C3%ABtar_Zall- Gjo%C3%A7aj_(v._2013).jpgZall-Gjocaj File:E851_WikipediaWeekendTirana2015_DejaMountain_666.JPGDejes Mt  See also  * Protected areas of Albania * Geography of Albania * Lura Lakes *Sope Lake, Kacnise Lakes (Liqenet e Kacnise) along Balgjajt Mt near Bulqize * Korab-Koritnik Nature Park  References  Further reading  *Hanbury- Tenison, Robin. 2009.

Its setting, with a backdrop of hills to the north and northwest, provides the garden with its own microclimate quite different from Hua Hin town, two kilometres to the east.  The garden  There are currently over 300 different plant species in the garden at Chom Dong, and the number continues to grow. Some of which are native to the original forest that existed. The garden includes: \\"sarapee\\" Mammea siamensis; \\"ked\\" Mimusops hexandra Roxb.; Angsana \\"pradu baan\\" Pterocarpus macrocarpus; several species of fig (Ficus); elephant apple \\"ma'tard\\" Dillenia indica; Siamese Neem Tree \\"sadao\\" Azadirachta indica A.; Singapore Almond \\"hoo kwang\\" Terminalia catappa; \\"oy chang\\" Lannea coromandelica Merr., \\"sark\\" Erythrophleum succirubrum Gagnep.; tamarind \\"makaam\\" Tamarindus indica; and various Lagerstroemia.

They are: * Cool, dry season (November to February) * Hot season (March to June) * Rainy season (July to October)  Local fauna  In the rainy season, bird life is most abundant. The red-wattled lapwing can be heard with its distinctive cry which has given rise to its Thai name \\"kratae-tae-waed\\", and Hoopoe, even the occasional kingfisher or egret frequent the water’s edge. Wild fowl comes down from the hill. More common are magpies and turtle doves. Owls and nightjars can be heard in the evenings. The lower reservoir in particular is a breeding ground for species of frogs and toads and after a rainfall their noise reaches symphonic level. They also attract snakes. Other garden residents include cicadas, species of butterflies and other insects, such as emerald jewel beetles, while the villa is home to geckos which are found in all parts of Thailand. Keeping a watchful eye on all this are the villa's Thai dogs, adopted when they were abandoned at a nearby wat. When the mango trees are laden with fruit, around March, they are joined by a troop of macaques who make their home in a cave on Khao Hin Lek Fai.  The villa  The grounds consist of three adjacent properties: the main part is Chom Dong Villa, with the later addition of Nornnon Villa to the southeast and Cherngkhao Villa to the northeast. Khao Hin Lek Fai National Park forms the north and northwest boundary. The main villa is a long, simple two-storey structure facing east towards the sea, visible on a clear day. The upper storey is surrounded by a wide veranda typical of old Hua Hin seaside residences. The other two villas, Nornnon and Cherngkao, are single-storey bungalows. There is also a children's treehouse on a tamarind tree near Nornnon. Of culinary interest at Chom Dong is a brick-surfaced open space for cooking \\"gai-ob-fang\\" (chicken baked in straw), a specialty of the house. Bales of rice straw are kept handy for this purpose as well as stacks of seasoned firewood for the pizza oven. = History of the villa = On November 30, 1975, the foundation stone was laid for a \\"pra tamnak\\" or royal villa, named \\"Chom Dong (\\"woodland vista\\") by HM Queen Ramphaiphanni, consort of HM King Rama VII. This became her country retreat during the last years of her life. Here she spent many months at a time. There were visits by members of the royal family from Klai Kangwol Palace in Hua Hin. She regularly played a few holes of golf at the nearby Royal Hua Hin Golf Course. The villa stood in peaceful isolation during its first two decades, but lately houses and residential communities began to spring up nearby as Hua Hin expanded. The road to the villa has been widened and extended up Khao Hin Lek Fai where a public garden and several viewpoints have been built. These developments have changed the ambience of the garden somewhat, but the grounds are extensive enough to maintain privacy and continue to be a sanctuary for plants and wildlife. = Sports and leisure = In recent months a 9-hole 735 yard par-3 golf course and an archery range have been added to Chom Dong. Hua Hin is known for its golf courses. There is a full-size golf course next door, Royal Hua Hin Golf Course, a mature links-style course from the 1920s. It is Thailand's oldest golf course and still one of the best. Nearby are a dozen international standard golf courses, such as Palm Hills, Black Mountain, and Majestic Creek. All are open to the public. There are numerous leisure activities at Chom Dong, both within the villa and in the garden. Hua Hin Beach is only a few minutes drive away. Within the main villa is a billiards room and a table football table for eight players. The wooden players have been customised to wear the colours of two of Bangkok's top universities. There is an extensive library in Chom Dong Villa and also in Baan Cherngkao. Hua Hin is 10 degrees north of the Equator and despite worsening light pollution in recent years, it is still possible to enjoy stargazing at night. A large collection of toys have accumulated over the past three generations, including steam engines and electric trains.

The book was first released on 5 October 2006, and was published by Doubleday. This is the third book of the daring Tracy (although it's the second book chronologically in the series), and this time she's up to more fun and games. Tracy's school/class are doing a play, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and Tracy would dearly love a role. She gets the leading role in the school play (Ebenezer Scrooge) but messes it up by punching her enemy, Justine Littlewood in the nose. Tracy gets back the role near the end of the book because the other kids who are auditioning for Scrooge are hopeless. Tracy lives in a Children's Home which she calls in her point of view \\"The Dumping Ground\\". She plans on becoming an actress just like her Hollywood mum, and she plans to make a start with this great opportunity. She desperately wants her mum to come and watch her acting Scrooge. Tracy does her very best. And spends her Christmas with Cam. Characters * Tracy Beaker – The main character of the story, that resides in a children's home (Or as she names it \\"The Dumping Ground\\"). Tracy has a wild but vibrant imagination that can sometimes take her to the extreme! She's sure that her mum Carly will come back for her but Tracy now has a foster mother called Cam. * Cam Lawson – Tracy's foster mother. She really cares for Tracy and bothers to come down every Saturday to see her, and Tracy very much enjoys these visits. * Jenny – Jenny is the strict but fair head careworker of \\"The Dumping Ground\\" She hates when Tracy causes mischief and havoc around the home, but she does show a soft side too! * Mike – A care worker at \\"The Dumping Ground\\", Mike is very caring towards Tracy and makes Spaghetti Bolognese which is her favourite! * Elaine the Pain – Tracy's social worker. Not a help at anything in 'Christmas mode' and always blubs on about Cheek and Attitude and Silly Offensive Personal Remarks that could be really hurtful. * Peter \\"Weed\\" Ingham – Peter lost his parents when he was younger and then went to live with his Nan. Unfortunately, she died shortly afterwards. This tragedy meant that Peter had to live at the Dumping Ground. He is desperately trying to be friends with Tracy who is always calling him a \\"weed\\". When Tracy is kicked out of the school play for giving Justine a nosebleed, he gets Tracy her role back by sending a signed petition to the headteacher upon hearing the school cannot get a good enough replacement (although it was questioned how genuine the petition was because some of the signatures included were from Mickey Mouse, Homer Simpson, David Beckham and Robbie Williams). * Justine Littlewood – Tracy's arch-enemy who disbelieves in Tracy's tales and teases her about mother, Carly. She is cast in the role of Jacob Marley in the play. * Louise – Both Tracy and Justine's friend. Unfortunately, Tracy no longer trusts her. * Mrs Darlow – Tracy's school headteacher. * Miss Simpkins – Tracy's Art and Drama teacher. There are three Tracy Beaker books in the series.

Wassmer was a French specialized woodworking company formed by Bernard Wassmer in 1905. It later became an aircraft manufacturer specializing in gliders. It was bought out by Issoire Aviation, a subsidiary of Siren, in 1978. Aircraft production The company entered into aircraft production in 1955 when it produced under licence a batch of Jodel D.112 two- seater aircraft at its factory at Issoire. The company also produced the single-seat WA-20 and two-seat WA-30 gliders. In 1959 the company produced the WA-40 Super IV a four-seat touring aircraft. In 1972 in co-operation with Siren they formed a joint company Consortium Europeén de Réalisation et de Ventes d'Avions (CERVA) to build a metal variant of the WA4/21, itself a variant of the WA-40. The components for the Cerva CE.43 Guépard were manufactured by Siren at Argenton-sur-Creuse and final assembly, equipment fitting and flight testing was carried out by Wassmer at Issoire. The company also co-operated with the CE-75 sailplane. In a move-away from the traditional woodworking heritage of the company it soon developed the ability to produce plastic or composite construction which led to the WA-50 series of four-seat aircraft. The company's last aircraft design was the WA-80 Piranha a two-seat trainer which was a scaled-down version of the WA-50. With both the WA-80 and different variants of the WA-50 in production the company had working capital problems. A receiver was appointed in 1977, and production was stopped. On 1 February 1978 Issoire Aviation, a company set up by Siren, bought the assets of Wassmer and used the former Issoire factory to build gliders and to continue to support Wassmer products.

C. for 1300 A.D. was submitted by the Otomi Jaltocan kingdom. At this time only Otomi and Totonac was spoken, but to AD 1400 Chichimeca came and introduced the use of the Nahuatl language. Decades later Acaxochitlan shall be submitted to the realm of Tenochtitlan, but only for a short time because after the kingdom of Texcoco would take control of the place, and it is in those moments that come the Spaniards, whom he would ally to defeat Tenochtitlan. Despite contact with Spain, there were many traditions that were not altered and that there are to this day, such as handmade embroidery, dances, and there were customs that were modified to give a mixture of cultures, such as how to build our homes, and food (gastronomy). Now let's talk first of its archeology, and architectural constructions after their handmade textiles and last of their dances and cuisines. In addition there were many social changes, a new system was implemented on the parcel, and put emphasis on evangelism, which affected the society as I outline the Spanish as the dominant language, and began the decline of native languages.  Languages  Unlike other Latin American countries, where native peoples belong mostly to a single language group, whose language has been elevated to the status of co-official in the company of Spanish, in Mexico there are about 62 indigenous peoples who speak between sixty two and more than a hundred different languages (depending on the source consulted). Unlike the United States where there are many linguistic groups, most of these groups are foreign, but a few are native. In the early twentieth century indigenous Mexicans were more than half of the population, their participation in the Mexican Revolution calling land and better living conditions, he was satisfied only partially, currently according to the count of 1995 the natives are only 11% of the total population. In Acaxochitlan live Otomi Tepehuas, Nahuas and mestizos, so it is a sample of what Mexico is today. Even though barely 34 thousand inhabitants only a third retains the native tongue, the other speaks only Spanish.  Architecture  chapel of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

For 1575 Acaxochitlan becomes part of the jurisdiction of Tulancingo. It is subject to the authority of Tulancingo. In 1606 for the first time the charge was given to a descendant of King Moctezuma, Mr. Juan Andrada Moctezuma; 33 years later is legally granted its territory \\"Acaxochi, what is called\\" legal fund\\".

The fabrics are from the town, they are very beautiful and also difficult to make, years of training are required, and are linked to the pre-Hispanic past, all symbols are embroidered on them, if you look carefully you will see as a basic figure appears the diamond ... and the union of several diamonds form the figure of the cross symbolizing the four directions, north, south, east and west. A few years ago the figure of the goddess of corn hallo, and this pre-Hispanic figure also appears with her huipil which is embroidered with diamonds. Until I found the recent \\"black gentleman\\" typical tape that men are tied at the waist, and so has the knot again symbolizes the four directions are. Beyond embroidery, this activity is an essential part of women's role in society, accepted by all, as an activity made by women and for the connoisseur of culture, women's clothing is a beautiful expression of our Mexico.

At the time both fighters were unbeaten. On the line was the WBO, WBC and WBA World belts as well as The Ring Magazine championship. Calzaghe won by unanimous decision. Build-up Joe Calzaghe entered the contest having held the WBO version of the World super middleweight title for nine years, originally beating Chris Eubank for the vacant belt in 1997. He had defended the belt a total of twenty times and had also briefly held the IBF version of the title following a victory over American Jeff Lacy. In total Calzaghe was undefeated in 43 fights and was considered one of the best pound for pound fighters in the World. Mikkel Kessler was the holder of both the WBC and WBA belts. Originally winning the WBA belt in November 2004 with a victory over Manny Siaca. He defended twice before taking on WBC champion Marcus Beyer in a unification bout in October 2006. He defended both titles in his next fight against Librado Andrade in March 2007. Kessler was considered to be second only to Calzaghe in the super middleweight division. Talks had been held between the two camps for the fight since October 2006 after Kessler successfully defended against Andrade and Calzaghe had defeated Sakio Bika. Kessler had complained that the Welshman spoke more about facing the likes of Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones than face his nearest rival in the division. Eventually in July 2007 a fight was agreed for November with Calzaghe's promoter Frank Warren and Mogens Palle representing Kessler coming up with a suitable deal. Speaking of the fight Calzaghe claimed that this was the fight that would mean the most to his career so far even more than the victories over Lacy and Eubank. The fight The fight was held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in front of 50,000 fans and broadcast on the television networks HBO and Setanta Sports. The first three rounds were closely fought before Kessler had the better of the 4th with two separate right uppercuts winning him the round. The following rounds saw Calzaghe's work rate begin to take control although Kessler seemed to have the advantage in terms of power with a number of shots seeming to rock Calzaghe further. According to Compubox at the end of the fight Calzaghe had thrown 1010 punches against 585 for Kessler although Kessler had the edge on accuracy and the number of power punches which landed. Speaking of the fight and the number of punches thrown Kessler said afterwards \\"his punches weren't particularly hard but it was confusing when he hit you 20 times.\\" In the interview immediately after the fight, Kessler did admit that Calzaghe had hurt him with one particular body shot. The decision meant that Calzaghe had been able to unify three belts in the division and fully establish himself as the top super middleweight in the World. Aftermath The fight with Kessler had been the 21st defense of Calzaghe's WBO title. The achievement meant that the boxer was now in the record books as having made the 4th highest number of world title defenses. Only the likes of Joe Louis (25 defenses), Dariusz Michalczewski (23 defenses) and Ricardo López (23 defenses) had achieved more in men's boxing. Calzaghe was awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award for his achievements in boxing throughout 2007. Kessler regrouped by winning back the now vacant WBA title against Dimitri Sartison and defending it once against Danilo Haussler.

The Cock and the Jewel is a fable attributed to Aesop. It is one of a number that feature only a single animal. As a trope in literature, the fable is reminiscent of stories used in zen such as the kōan. It presents, in effect, a riddle on relative values and is capable of many interpretations, depending on the point of view from which it is regarded. The Fable In its most cogent, unelaborated form, the fable is very short. A cockerel seeking food finds instead a precious gemstone, recognises the worth it has for others, but rejects it as being of no practical use to himself. The rejection is generally shown in the form of a direct address by the cockerel to the gemstone, as in this modern English translation: Literary tradition The Cock and the Jewel was given prominence in medieval Europe by virtue of the fact that it opens what was then a standard text for the teaching of grammar, the so-called elegaic Romulus. This was generally committed to memory in early school years.Edward Wheatley, Mastering Aesop. University Press of Florida, 2000. See the discussion in Chapter 3, \\"Toward a Grammar of Medieval Fable Reading in its Pedagogical Context\\", pp.52-96 The fable is typically short and given in eight lines of elegaic metre with a further two providing a moral judgement.The first line of the Latin setting is Dum rigido fodit ore fimum, dum queritat escam. The title is De Gallo et Jaspide. Reprinted in Edward Wheatley, Mastering Aesop. University Press of Florida, 2000. P.196. See also Léopold Hervieux, ed., Les Fabulistes Latins depuis le siècle d'Auguste jusqu'à la. fin du Moyen-Age. Paris: Firmin Didot, 1883-94 (modern reprint, New York: Burt Franklin, 1960, vol. 2, 316-7.) It portrays the cock as startled to discover such a beautiful object in the dirt (in sorde manens) and recognising that he is not the right creature to have found it. The writer's emphatic moral conclusion provided the standard medieval interpretation of the fable: \\"Cockerel, you represent a fool, jewel, you stand for the fine gift of wisdom; for the fool, this corn has no taste\\" (). The explicit judgement of the cock's action as foolish, on the grounds that the jewel represents wisdom rather than mere allure or material wealth, may represent the standard mediaeval answer to Aesop's riddle, but variants in the tradition did exist. The story stands at the head of Marie de France's 12th-century fable collection, the Ysopet. There she adds a detail common in later retellings, that the cock is scratching on a dunghill, so emphasizing the contrast between the find and its location. The cock makes the observation that a rich man would have known how to make proper use of the gem it has uncovered, whereas \\"since I can't embellish you as I would like, I'll not wear you at all.\\" At odds with this reasonable conclusion, Marie comments that the cock is like those who, \\"if everything does not go as they wish, they do not value good and honor at all but instead take the worst and scorn the best.\\"Marie de France version from the Ysopet, together with a modern translation by Mary Lou Martin. See page 35 of the Google partial preview. Illustration by Wenceslas Hollar for The Fables of Aesop, 1665 John Lydgate's version, written about 1410, is longer and more nuanced. He begins the Prologue to his Isopes Fabules with the statement that \\"Wisdom is more in price than gold in coffers\\" but turns that to mean that beneath the \\"boysterous and rurall\\" fable hide valuable lessons for life, so anticipating the Cock's eventual find. In his description of the Cock, Lydgate presents it as a noble beast and a notable example of diligence. On discovering a jacinth in the dunghill, the Cock rejects keeping it as being contrary to his natural station in life. All the wisdom it might symbolise, from his practical point of view, is no better than speculation on 'how the man came first into the moon'. Lydgate then comments that the Cock has made the wisest choice in rejecting worldliness and preferring virtue.Lydgate's rhyme royal expansion, c.1410. University of Virginia library. Some three centuries later, the periodical writer John Hawkesworth adapted the story to a similar moral in an extended poem, \\"The Fop, Cock, and Diamond\\", in The Gentleman's Magazine for 1741.Using the pseudonym H. Greville, Vol.11, pp.327-328 There the diamond's journey is traced from the ring of a man-about- town to its discovery by the cock, whose noble conduct is contrasted with the vain behaviour of its previous owner, leading to the advice that one should keep one's wants to simple necessities. Samuel Croxall's prose retelling, originally published in 1722 and many times reprinted, also approaches this conclusion. Noting the fable's ambiguity, he comments that \\"the most probable intention of the author was to hold forth an example of industry and good sense. The lesson inculcated is the wisdom of estimating things by their intrinsic worth, and of refusing to be led away by doubtful fascinations from the known path of duty.\\"Aesop's Fables, Fable I But the Cock's abstention from the trappings of the governing class is also capable of the political reading given it by John Ogilby in his Fables of Aesop paraphras'd in verse (1665).Annabel M. Patterson: Aesopian Writing and Political History, Duke University Press, 1991 The lesson there of maintaining the balance of social relations is emphasised further by Wenceslaus Hollar's accompanying print in which the cock astride its dunghill is wittily contrasted with the Germanic castle on the neighbouring hilltop. The other literary expansion to survive from the 15th century is Robert Henryson's The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian, written c.1480, with which this fable, under the title of The Taill of the Cok and the Jasp, begins.Henryson's rhyme royal expansion, c.1480. University of Rochester library. There is also a contemporary translation, The Cock and the Jasp, on the STELLA Teaching Resources website of the University of Glasgow. His own moral conclusion follows the standard verse Romulus closure, making the rejected jasp an unambiguous figure for wisdom and condemning the consequent materialism of the cockerel. This is in line with the Biblical simile of the uselessness of casting pearls before swine, to which Henryson alludes in the poem. For him the state of nature is limited by brute appetite; it requires wisdom to discern the way of learning and virtue. Caxton appears to agree in his contemporary publication of the fables (1484). The cock, he says, represents \\"the fool whiche careth not for sapyence ne for wysedome\\", but then draws the sting from his criticism in continuing \\"and by the stone is to vnderstond this fayre and playsaunt book\\".Transcript of the printed edition by Caxton, on the 'Aesopica' website. In La Fontaine's Fables it is given a materialist twist by likening the cock to those who are incapable of judging the 'intrinsic worth' of anything (I.20). After a very brief telling of the cock's rejection of the pearl as being inedible, La Fontaine describes a parallel situation in which a man inherits a valuable manuscript but prefers to have cash in hand for it.Fontaine's metrical version of the fable, on the 'Read Book Online' website. According to his reading of the fable, what the man and the cock lack is aesthetic judgement rather than wisdom. Some later interpretations are equally materialistic. Thomas Bewick applies the fable to the choice of sexual partner in his Select Fables of Aesop (1784),Bewick's 1784 version of the fable, on the 'Aesopica' website. while the Canadian author Robertson Davies converts it to a playlet satirising devotees of the Readers Digest in his A Masque of Aesop (1955).Citation for the version by Robertson Davies A Masque of Aesop, 1955. Creighton University. Artistic interpretations Such a short fable suggested little latitude for invention to most book illustrators, apart from the sly juxtaposition of dunghill and castle already noted in Hollar's print. The same criticism can be made of the nearly contemporary Flemish painting of the subject by Frans Snyders.Nice Art Gallery online In the second half of the 19th century, the French animal painter Philibert Léon Couturier, whose specialty was poultry, managed to provide two amusing variations on the theme. In Le coq et la perle, now in the Musée Denon, Chalon-sur-Saône, the bird struts by with a pearl pendant hanging from its beak, the image of self-regard.Online at the Couturier site In contrast, Coq et perle pictures the bird approaching a fallen necklace with great caution.Online at the Couturier site A more symbolical interpretation by Gustav-Adolf Mossa depicts a fashionable courtier in motley dress that includes a cock's comb. So engrossed is he in his own appearance that he ignores a female beauty dressed in white who stands in the background looking at him.Dated 1909, it is illustrated in the Coilhouse Magazine online La Fontaine's version of the fable allowed illustrations of the simpleton selling a valuable edition to whom he compared the cock.Two of these can be viewed with the French original online Settings of his words have been comparatively rare. In 1873 it was set for men's voices by Emile Pessard, and later for a capella male voices by Noel-Gallon (1891-1927).

Khariton Chebotaryov was born in Vologda into a poor family. In 1755, he entered a gymnasium under the Moscow University, becoming a university student six years later. Upon his graduation from the university in 1764, Chebotaryov was soon hired by his alma mater as a translator from Latin and German. In 1767, he was transferred to the gymnasium as a teacher of history and geography. In 1773, Khariton Chebotaryov was entrusted with teaching Russian literature, simultaneously doing translations from Latin, German, and French with his students. In 1775, he was appointed deputy librarian (суб-библиотекарь) of the university library (only a professor could hold this post) and editor-in-chief of the Moskovskie Vedomosti for the next three years. In 1776, Khariton Chebotaryov became an extraordinary professor at the Russian Literature Department, simultaneously remaining a philosophy and world history teacher at the gymnasium. Upon the death of Professor Johann Gottfried Reichel, Chebotaryov delivered lectures on European history and Russian literature at the gymnasium. In 1778, Khariton Chebotaryov was made an ordinary professor and appointed librarian and censor at the university theater. In 1778-1783, he was a secretary of the academic council (университетская конференция), inspector of the university gymnasium and normal school. In 1782, Khariton Chebotaryov was promoted to the rank of a collegiate assessor and then court councilor (1786). At the behest of the Empress, he and Anton Barsov were engaged in copying out notes from Russian chronicles, located at synodal and patriarchal libraries and Moscow State Archive. These notes were later presented to Catherine the Great and then served as a source for her Notes on Russian History. In consideration of his efforts, Khariton Chebotaryov was rewarded with 500 silver rubles. After the transformation of the university charter, Chebotaryov was elected its rector (being in the rank of collegiate councilor) and awarded with the Order of Saint Anna (2nd Class). Upon his resignation from this post, Chebotaryov was appointed a permanent representative of the university board, remaining as such until his death. In 1809, Khariton Chebotaryov was promoted to the rank of state councilor. During the Patriotic War of 1812, he lost his precious library and personal archives, which would come to him as a shock and greatly undermine his health. As a result, Chebotaryov suffered a stroke and died on July 26, 1815. He was interred at the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow. Khariton Chebotaryov is known to have been a member of several learned societies, such as the Free Russian Assembly (Вольное Российское Собрание), Society of the Admirers of the Russian Language (Общество Любителей Русской Словесности; honorary member), Society of History and Russian Antiquities (Общество Истории и Древностей Российских; chairman), and Moscow Masonic Lodge.

The Warriors are Ireland's first primarily gay rugby team although it is open to anyone with an interest in playing rugby and includes heterosexual members. History Emerald Warriors RFC was formed in August 2003 by Richie Whyte to provide gay and bisexual men the opportunity to play rugby in Ireland and internationally and to create links with similar teams and organisations in the UK, Europe and America. The team began playing in 2004 and took part in the Bingham Cup, often referred to as the 'Gay World Cup' that year, representing Ireland. They competed again in 2006 and went on to host the event in 2008, in Dublin City University's sports complex with endorsement from the IRFU. The event was deemed a success for rugby in general, for bringing gay rugby in Ireland to a new level of organisation and popularity by The Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN). They entered the Leinster Metro Junior league in 2007. They also competed in the Union Cup a biennial European, non-professional, gay rugby union tournament in London 2009, Amsterdam 2011 and Bristol 2013.

Crest and colours The club colours are green, white and blue. The team crest is based on a traditional Celtic shield with several rugby balls forming a decorative floral pattern at the center of the crest. Documentary film The team was subject of a documentary film on Irish language station TG4 called Queering the Pitch which followed the Emerald Warriors, representing Ireland at the Bingham Cup in 2006. The documentary, which was directed by Tom Maguire, was also screened at GAZE: The Dublin International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival in 2007. Mention in court ruling The club was mentioned in a 2009 Irish Supreme Court judgment on Portmarnock Golf Club when ruling on equality legislation regarding whether the club could prohibit women from joining. It ruled there is no prohibition on the establishment of clubs or associations whose membership is limited to persons of a particular gender and made a specific reference to the Emerald Warriors recognising that rugby is not a \\"need\\" of gay men. Other events The Emearld Warriors hosted the Mark Bingham Memorial Cup in 2008 and will host the Union Cup in 2019. The team and its members have also taken part in events such as the Dublin Pride Parade and Mr Gay Ireland, with club member Barry Meegan who was asked by his teammates to represent the club, winning the competition in 2007 and raising money for HIV and AIDS related charities based in Dublin in the process.

This report argued for the pacification of this troublesome area and he was appointed governor in 1881. However the area erupted and he left in March 1883. In 1886, he served on the Dutch Council for India, but retired in 1893. He died in Brussels in 1907 after retiring to Europe.

It is the third largest river in the region by annual discharge, and its watershed encompasses the most densely populated areas east of the Jordan River. It rises in springs near Amman, and flows through a deep and broad valley into the Jordan, at an elevation lower. At its spring lays 'Ain Ghazal (Arabic: ), a major archaeological site that dates back to the Neolithic. Archaeological finds along the course of the river indicate the area was rich in flora and fauna in the past. The river is heavily polluted and its restoration is one of the top priorities for the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment. Geologically, the Zarqa River is about 30 million years old. It is well known for its amber deposits that date back to the Hauterivian era of the Early Cretaceous (135 m.y.). A remarkable flora and fauna was reported from this amber reflecting tropical paleoenvironmental conditions prevailing during the time of resin deposition (Kaddumi, 2005; 2007). Name The Arabic name, Nahr az-Zarqa' (نهر الزرقاء) means \\"the blue river\\", where nahr means river and zarqa' (زرقاء) means blue. The name is of Akkadian origin (Zar-Ka) which mean the Place of Water (Zar being Water and Ka being Place or Area), hence at the Dead Sea is the Zara springs (Zara, Water) and also in the heart of Amman an area locally called (Wadi Sakra) which comes from Wadi Zara which means the Valley of Water.[?] Biblical Jabbok The Zarqa River is identified with the biblical river Jabbok.The Oxford History of the Biblical World, Michael David Coogan, p. 10, Oxford University Press, 2001 Biblical Jacob crossed the Jabbok on his way to Canaan, after leaving Harran. It leads west into the Sukkot Valley, from where one crosses over the Jordan and can easily reach Shechem, as Jacob eventually did. The biblical cities of Zaretan and Adam are also at the mouth of the valley. The river is first mentioned in the Book of Genesis in connection with the meeting of Jacob and Esau, and with the struggle of Jacob with the angel. It was the boundary separating the territory of Reuben and Gad from that of Ammon, the latter being described as lying along the Jabbok. The territory of Sihon is described as extending \\"from Arnon unto Jabbok\\" (), and it was reclaimed later by the King of Ammon. EusebiusOnomasticon, ed. Ferdinand Larsow and Gustav Parthey, , Berlin, 1862. places the river between Gerasa and Philadelphia. Geography and hydrographyCourse= Zarqa River watershed (Executive Action Team (EXACT), Multilateral Working Group on Water Resources) Zarqa river running in Jerash Governorate The headwaters of the Zarqa begin just northeast of Amman, rising from a spring named Ain Ghazal (\\"Gazelle spring\\"). The river flows to the north before heading west. Rising on the eastern side of the mountains of Gilead, it runs a course of about in a wild and deep ravine before flowing into the Jordan River between Gennesaret and the Dead Sea, at a point below its origin.Middle East Patterns, Colbert C. Held, Mildred McDonald Held, p.291 Westview Press, 2000 At its higher reaches, the river banks are mostly steep and canyon-like. Near Ain Ghazal, two tributary wadis join the river, and it opens up into a shallow basin.Rollefson, Gary O, Ain Ghazal: An Early Neolithic Community in Highland Jordan, near Amman, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 255 (Summer, 1984) It forms the border between the Jordanian administrative regions of Irbid and Balqa Governorate. =Water flow, catchment area, use= The river is perennial, but with a very low base flow of about 2 million to 3 million cubic meters per month during the summer months, and as much as 5-million to 8 million cubic meters per month during the rainy winter months. This makes it the second largest tributary of the lower Jordan River, after the Yarmouk River, and the third largest river in the region by annual discharge. Irregular floods after rain storms may increase the flow to as much as 54 million cubic meters. The median annual flow is 63.3 million cubic meters. The total basin area is the largest in Jordan.GIS-hydrological models for managing water resources in the Zarqa River basin, N. Al-Abed, F. Abdulla and A. Abu Khyarah, Environmental Geology, Volume 47, Number 3 / February, 2005 A small dam, Al-Rwyha dam, near the village of Dayr Alla, marks the end of the upstream portion of the river, where it is natural and fast-flowing with very clear water. There is very little agriculture along the banks of the river in this region, which are very rocky. Downstream from this dam, the water level is very low, and the river banks are intensively used for agriculture, as well as grazing by sheep and goatsResults of an initial field survey for otters (Lutra lutra) in Jordon The King Talal Dam was built across the lower Zarqa in 1970, and created a reservoir with a capacity of 55 million cubic meters, and increased in 1987 to 86 million cubic meters. When built, it was expected that the reservoir would supply water for municipal use in the Amman region. However, the current levels of pollution in the lake make the water unfit for human consumption, and it is used for irrigation only.Ramsar Sites Information Service =Bridges= The new Jerash Bridge crosses the Zarqa upstream of King Talal reservoir, on the road from Amman to Jerash. The bridge is the site of a gauging station where flow measurements are continuously taken. In the city of Zarqa, several bridges, vehicular and pedestrian, cross the river. The earliest of these was built by the Chechen founders of the city. Current bridges include the Zawahreh Bridge, a vehicular bridge connecting Baha' al- Din Street with al-Zuhur Street and another connecting Baha' al-Din Street with King Talal Street. Two pedestrian bridges connect al-Zuhur Street and Baha' al-Din Street, and Wasfi al-Tal Street and Petra Street. Natural history The geological origins of the Zarqa river are about 30 million years old, when the Jordan Rift Valley was formed. A ripple effect of its formation was the creation of side-wadis. The Zarqa river carved into the western edge of one of these side wadis.Zarqa River Eco Development The earliest exposed formations in the area date from the Triassic and early Jurassic periods, and have been named Zerqa and Kurnub formations. The rock formations are marine sediments, remnants of the prehistoric Tethys Sea, which used to cover the area running roughly east–west, halfway across the present Dead Sea. Along the Zarqa, crystalline limestone alternating with shale was found. The next layer is a 20-30 meter high layer of gypsum, argillaceous marly lime, shales and iron-rich stone and sandstone. This layer is rich in fossils.Tribes and Territories In Transition =Flora= Archaeological finds of charcoaled remains indicate that poplar and tamarix used to grow along the banks of the Zarqa, with forests of wild oak growing on the hillsides. Today, tamarix thickets are still widespread in the floodplains, and the banks are cultivated with fruit orchards and vegetable fields. Along the course of Zarqa River, water is pumped directly and used to irrigate crops of leafy vegetables such as parsley, spinach, cabbage, cauliflower and lettuce, as well as potatoes. Olive trees are also found along the river's banks.Reclamation’s history of the Jordan River Basin in Jordan, a focus on agriculture: past trends, actual farming systems and future prospective. Tulips grow on many hillsides of the river, while in the springs area and the watercourse, water vegetation is found.The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, Jordan Natural pine forests grow in the King Talal Dam area. Along the upstream banks, where the river runs wild, one finds the common reed, oleander and Typha species. Since the waters of the Zarqa are highly contaminated, with high levels of organic matter and various chemical compounds (especially detergents and dyes), the use of Zarqa water for irrigation has significantly altered the biodiversity of the natural flora, and caused the disappearance of the majority of fresh water species.Water scarcity in relation to food security and sustainable use of biodiversity in Jordan =Fauna= In prehistoric times, the area was rich with fauna, and 45 distinct animal species have been identified, half of them wild animals. Domesticated goats were the most common, and gazelles were the most frequently occurring wild animal species. Today, the area is still home to a diverse population of birds and mammals, and some of the breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in Jordan.Observations on the avifauna of the eastern Jordan Valley, during July and August of 2005 Among the bird species found are the European roller, desert lark, Dead Sea sparrow, desert finch and blue-cheeked bee-eater. The King Talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species. Notable birds found in the lake area include the little bittern, cattle egrets, grey herons, white storks, common teal and Eurasian coot. The lake's waters sustain fish, some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species. The most common are tilapia. Migratory birds also winter in the man-made pools which make up the Kherbit Al-Samra Sewage Treatment Plant, located in a broad depression close to Wadi Dhulayl, the main tributary of the Zarqa River. As many as 6,000 white storks have been spotted roosting there. Mammals found in the area include the common otter (Lutra lutra), and the Persian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus). The otter is considered a threatened species. History The Zarqa valley was an important passageway connecting the Eastern Desert with the Jordan Valley. =Prehistory= 'Ain Ghazal, the origin of the spring the feeds the Zarqa river, is a major archaeological site, dating back to the Neolithic period. It was continuously occupied for more than two thousand years, and the earliest finds date to 7200 BCE. 'Ain Ghazal is one of the earliest known human settlements with evidence of domesticated animals. With a population of around 3,000 at its height, it was also one of the largest prehistoric population centers in the Near East, with about five time the population of neighboring Jericho. =Iron Age= During a 1982 survey of the Zarqa Valley, a number of Early Iron Age sites were discovered, concentrated along the banks of the Zerqa and its tributaries.Robert L. Gordon, Linda E. Villiers: Telul edh Dhahab and its environs surveys of 1980 and 1982: a preliminary report. In: Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan. Vol. 27, 1983, p. 275-289. One of them, Tulul adh-Dhahab, is under further research now. =Hellenistic Jarash= Wadi Jarash, a northern tributary of the Zarqa River, flows through the modern city of Jerash. Inhabited since the Bronze Age, Jerash was an important Greco-Roman city known as Gerasa, home to noted mathematician Nicomachus. The ruins of the city are well preserved and have been extensively excavated. =Modern town of Zarqa= Zarqa, Jordan's second largest city, is built on the banks of the Zarqa River, and is the largest settlement along its course. The town of Zarqa was founded in 1902 by Chechen immigrants.The Chechens, Amjad M. Jaimoukha, p.231, Routledge, 2005 Its population grew rapidly with an influx of Palestinian refugees who fled the West Bank during the Six-Day War. Environmental concerns The Zarqa river is highly polluted. In many areas, raw sewage flows untreated directly into the river through dry riverbeds (wadis), contaminating it and creating a stench which has been a cause of numerous complaints, particularly during the summer months. Though sewage treatment stations have been built in a couple of locations (including Ain Ghazal and Khirbet As Samra), these stations often receive more water than they can handle. Such overflow occurs during winter floods, as well as during summer months when the population increases with the return of migrant workers to Amman. During overflow, untreated water runs directly to the Zarqa river. As a result, the Zarqa's water is brownish colored, often with dense foam due to large amounts of organic matter. Other sources of pollutants are the illegal dumping of industrial waste, including those from textile factories, and batteries and oils from garages. The river's watershed encompasses the most densely populated areas east of the Jordan River, and it flows through an industrialized area that is home to more than 52% of Jordan's industrial plants, including the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company. During the summer months, treated domestic and industrial waste-water compose nearly all of the flow, and substantially degrade the water quality. Coupled with over-extraction of water from the underground aquifer and the naturally low base flow of the Zarqa, this has created a major problem, described as one of Jordan's \\"environmental black spots\\". and has made rehabilitation of the Zarqa a top priority for the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment. The restoration project is estimated to cost $30 million.

This book was republished in 2007 by the Foreign Languages Press with the updated title of Lu Xun Selected Works. Stories included in the collection are drawn from three of Lu Xun's story collections: 《吶喊》Call to Arms (CTA), 《彷徨》 \\"Wandering\\" (W), and 《故事新編》 \\"Old Tales Retold\\" (OTR).  Major themes  One major theme in the stories in this collection is that habits of mind (psychology or \\"spirit\\") need to be examined; improvements in material conditions and institutions, while important, are not sufficient by themselves to renew China. See in particular A Madman's Diary and The True Story of Ah Q. Lu Xun employed point of view in his stories in a way that was novel at the time for Chinese literature, helping readers consider new possibilities about the true nature of the reality around them.Douwe W. Fokkema, in \\"Lu Xun: The Impact of Russian Literature,\\" in Merle Goldman, ed., Modern Chinese Literature in the May Fourth Era (Cambridge: Harvard, 1977), writes, \\"One of the principal devices Lu Xun appears to have borrowed from nineteenth-century Russian literature is that of introducing a point of view that does not coincide with that of most readers and departs from the prevailing literary tradition . . . . it thwarts the expectations of the readers . . . . It wakes and shocks them by means of alienating devices that, for instance, prevent the reader from identifying himself with the main character . . . .\\" (p. 97-8) A second major theme in the stories is the problem of how members of the intellectual class are to live their lives. It is a theme in many stories, including Kong Yiji, My Old Home, In the Wine Shop, Regret for the Past, and others. A third major theme in the stories is commentary on traditional customs and institutions. The stories look at the specific dysfunctions of particular customs and institutions, and also at the general result in which people are discarded. It is a theme in many stories, especially Kong Yiji and The New Year Sacrifice.  Story synopses  Preface to Call to Arms= In the preface, signed on December 3, 1922, Lu Xun describes the evolution of his social concerns. An important thread to this preface is his encounters with traditional Chinese medicine and the problems of health care, which bears directly on several stories in the collection. Lu Xun also describes one of his overarching objectives as a writer and social critic: he sees society as \\"an iron house without windows, absolutely indestructible, with many people fast asleep inside who will soon die of suffocation.\\"Selected Stories of Lu Hsun. WW Norton, 2003. 5. Print. From Is it possible to help them? Or will he only make them suffer unnecessarily by intervening? = A Madman's Diary = (狂人日記, (CTA), dated April 1918) This story ostensibly reveals the delusions of a man who has passed through a period of madness, and has now returned to sanity and participation in \\"normal\\" society. A theme in the story is the nature of reality, and the difficulty of attaining a perspective from which to see reality clearly. \\"I begin to realize that during the past thirty-odd years I have been in the dark . . .\\" A secondary theme is the self-destructiveness of traditional Chinese society, likening it to cannibalism. \\"I have only just realized that I have been living all these years in a place where for four thousand years they have been eating human flesh.\\" The story is said to have drawn inspiration from Nikolai Gogol's story Diary of a Madman. Moreover, it is believed that the writing of this story closely coincides with Lu Xun's personal transition from a focus on medicine to a focus on psychology and literature.\\"It was written \\"during a long spell of mental questioning and rumination . . . . His long period of identity confusion in Japan proved that his preoccupations could not be sufficiently fulfilled by medicine. Literature was an outlet for both his intellectual and psychological needs, but it cost him considerable mental anguish to make the final transition from science to literature.\\" Leo Ou-fan Lee, \\"Genesis of a Writer: Notes on Lu Xun's Educational Experience, 1881-1909,\\" in Merle Goldman, ed., Modern Chinese Literature in the May Fourth Era (Cambridge: Harvard, 1977), p. 187-8. = Kong Yiji = (孔乙己, (CTA), dated March 1919) This is the story of a local intellectual who falls afoul of his community. A major theme in this story is the way in which traditional Chinese society's system of advancement for intellectuals left many discarded and useless. \\"[Kong] had studied the classics but had never passed the official examination. With no way of making a living, he grew poorer and poorer, until he was practically reduced to beggary.\\" A related theme is the physical cruelty of traditional Chinese \\"justice.\\" In the story, Kong is given a beating that lasts \\"nearly all night, until his legs were broken,\\" and afterward he is reduced to crawling from place to place. = Medicine = (藥, (CTA), dated April 1919) This story focuses on a sick boy and a traditional Chinese folk medicine practice. Two major (and inter-related) themes in this story are superstition, and man's search for meaning in a confusing world. Lu Xun acknowledged the negative impact of beliefs about traditional Chinese medicine on his own life.In the preface to the collection, Call to Arms, Lu Xun wrote, \\"[T]hese stories have resulted from what I have been unable to erase from my memory. For more than four years I used to go, almost daily, to a pawnbroker's and to a medicine shop. . . . I used to hand clothes and trinkets up to the counter twice my height, take the money proffered with contempt, then go to the counter the same height as I to buy medicine for my father who had long been ill. . . . aloe root dug up in winter, sugar-cane that had been three years exposed to frost, twin crickets, and ardisia . . . all of which were difficult to procure. But my father's illness went from bad to worse until he died.\\" In Medicine, the characters are told, \\"A roll dipped in human blood . . . can cure any consumption!\\" though this promise proves false. Scholars have suggested that Lu Xun's family experience with traditional Chinese medicine was crucial in forming his psychology and personality.Leo Ou-fan Lee, \\"Genesis of a Writer: Notes on Lu Xun's Educational Experience, 1881-1909,\\" in Merle Goldman, ed., Modern Chinese Literature in the May Fourth Era (Cambridge: Harvard, 1977), p. 166-8. Despite its earthy topic, the story has a carefully wrought structure.Milena Doleželová-Velingerová provides a detailed analysis of the techniques of \\"information manipulation\\" and \\"dynamic opposition\\" used in \\"Lu Xun's 'Medicine,'\\" in Merle Goldman, ed., Modern Chinese Literature in the May Fourth Era (Cambridge: Harvard, 1977), p. 230-31. Summary Old Chuan and his wife, the proprietors of a small tea shop, save their money to buy a folk medicine cure for their son, Young Chuan, who is dying of tuberculosis. The story opens with Old Chuan leaving their shop and going to the home of the person selling the cure, a \\"roll of steamed bread, from which crimson drops were dripping to the ground.\\" The crimson drops, we soon learn, are blood from a young man, Xia Yu (夏瑜), who was recently executed apparently for revolutionary activities. Xia Yu's name, his surname the name of a season and his given name a character with the jade radical, is often seen as an allusion to the name of Qiu Jin (秋瑾), a friend of Lu Xun who was beheaded for revolutionary activity.http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4986a78c01000bi6.htmlhttp://blog.sciencenet.cn/blog-750818-735561.html The cure does not work and the mother of Young Chuan meets the mother of the executed revolutionary in the cemetery. Here they both behold a mysterious wreath on the revolutionary's grave, a wreath that Lu Hsun, in his introduction to this collection (which he entitled A Call to Arms), describes as one of his \\"innuendoes\\" to \\"those fighters who are galloping on in loneliness, so that they do not lose heart.\\"(p = Tomorrow = (明天, (CTA), dated June 1920) This story also concerns a sick child and traditional Chinese folk medicine. It raises the question: what if the ability to change the course of events is largely illusory? Do we still go on? \\"Something which had never happened to her before, and which she had thought never could happen, had happened. . . . She was only a simple woman. What solution could she think of?\\" = An Incident = (一件小事, (CTA), dated July 1920) More a meditation than a story, in An Incident a man's rickshaw puller collides with a pedestrian, and the passenger must confront the question: when do other people begin to matter? When do his own concerns have to adjust to those around him? \\"The military and political affairs of those years I have forgotten as completely as the classics I read in my childhood. Yet this incident keeps coming back to me, often more vivid than in actual life, teaching me shame, urging me to reform, and giving me fresh courage and hope.\\" (For comparison, see the book Rickshaw Boy by the Chinese novelist Lao She, published nearly two decades later.) = Storm in a Teacup = (風波, (CTA), dated October 1920) In this story, the \\"storm\\" is a change in government (presumably the Imperial Restoration of 1917). The \\"teacup\\" is a village in which some residents are preparing to turn the tables on the revolutionaries from some years before, while others face a simple, practical concern: will certain people's lack of a queue be noticed (and be punished)? Or are they too far from the action to be noticed? One theme of the story is the difficulty of meaningful political participation in such a widely dispersed polity as China. Another theme is the life and death impact politics is able to make on people, even down at the village level. \\"I don't think the emperor will ascend the throne. I passed Mr. Chao's wine shop today, and he was sitting there reading again, with his queue coiled on the top of his head. He wasn't wearing his long gown, either.\\" = My Old Home = (故鄉, (CTA), dated January 1921) On a visit to his old hometown, a man finds that a \\"lamentably thick wall\\"... \\"an invisible high wall\\" has grown up between himself and his old acquaintances. Themes in the story include: artificial divisions among people due to class differences, the persistence of memory, the way people as well as places constitute the sense of a place, the painfulness of disconnection from the past, and the dilemma of intellectuals who must turn their attention away from the past and face present reality. A theme in the story is the Chinese concept of ancestral home. = The True Story of Ah Q = (阿Q正傳, (CTA), dated December 1921) The story involves an ordinary village dweller of few means, and describes the habits of mind that he employs in navigating the course of his days. (In particular, he finds pretexts to transform many failures and embarrassments into \\"victories\\" by self-consolation.) A major theme of the story is the question of what constitutes a bigger challenge: material conditions themselves, or the psychological processes that obstruct us from engaging realistically with material conditions. = Village Opera = (社戲, (CTA), dated October 1922) Ostensibly a comparison of the experience of attending Chinese opera performances in the city vs. a village, the story evolves into an essay on how people interact with each other within the village context, including attitudes toward sharing. = The New Year Sacrifice = (祝福, (W), dated February 1924) The \\"New Year Sacrifice\\" refers to a sacred rite taking place during the sensitive New Year period . . . and indirectly to the old widow who is too impure to be allowed to help prepare it. She had (forcibly) been remarried after her first husband died, only to be widowed again a few years later. The story explores many themes. One theme is the use of taboos, and whether they are consistent with progress. More broadly, the themes of women's rights and marriage practices (including arranged marriage) are explored. \\"This poor woman, abandoned by people in the dust as a tiresome and worn-out toy, once left her own imprint in the dust, and those who enjoy life must have wondered at her for wishing to prolong her existence; but now at least she has been swept clear by eternity. Whether spirits exist or not I do not know; but in the present world when a meaningless existence ends, so that someone whom others are tired of seeing is no longer seen, it is just as well, both for the individual concerned and for others.\\" Even more broadly, the story raises the question of what society should do to address the plight of those who are traumatized, severely depressed, or otherwise psychologically, emotionally, or spiritually broken. Finally, Lu Xun considers universal themes, showing how people's \\"religious\\" questions (\\"What happens when you die? Is there a hell?\\") are relevant, even to non-believers. He suggests that sticking with a \\"safe\\" response (\\"I am not sure\\") is not enough. = In the Wine Shop = (在酒楼上, (W), dated February 1924) In this story, the narrator meets an old friend who expresses frustration because the need to respect the feelings of others (especially his mother) force him to engage in \\"futile\\" exercises, and the need to support himself forces him to teach the outmoded Confucian canon. \\"Who cares about such futile affairs anyway? One only wants to muddle through them somehow. When I have muddled through New Year I shall go back to teaching the Confucian Classics as before.\\" The story relates closely to the changing attitudes toward the traditional canon in the course of China's New Culture Movement. The story deals with the theme of modern Chinese intellectuals confronting day-to-day reality. \\"In future? I don't know. Just think: Has any single thing turned out as we hoped of all we planned in the past? I'm not sure of anything now, not even of what I will do tomorrow, nor even of the next minute . . . . \\" = Happy Family = (幸福的家庭, (W), dated March 1924) This story draws humorously on contemporary magazine subjects (the \\"happy family,\\" the \\"ideal husband\\") to reveal, inter alia, what a real happy family looks like . . . dealing with the quotidien: errands, the crying of children, family chatter . . . . The principal character in the story is writing a magazine article about a \\"happy family\\": \\"The family naturally consists of a husband and wife - the master and mistress - who married for love. Their marriage contract contains over forty terms going into great detail, so that they have extraordinary equality and absolute freedom. Moreover they have both had a higher education and belong to the cultured elite . . . . \\" = Soap = (肥皂, (W), dated March 1924) Lu Xun uses a simple bar of soap to reveal experiential context (e.g. a shopping expedition) and conjugal intimacy (as it mediates the man's relationship with his wife) and social policy (revealing male chauvinism toward a female beggar), and more. Lu Xun raises the question of who has the real power to deal with and bring about change: the stumbling man or his subtle wife? = Divorce = (離婚, dated November 1925) A young woman holds out hope that her marital dispute will be resolved in her favor. Lu Xun suggests that \\"getting a hearing\\" is like a dream; the reality is that the powers-that-be settle things in the usual manner. \\"Seventh Master moved his lips, but nobody could hear what he was saying. Only his servant heard, and the force of this order entered his very marrows, for twice he twitched as if overcome by awe. . . . [She] knew that something unexpected and completely unforeseen was about to happen - something which she was powerless to prevent. Only now did she realize the full power of Seventh Master.\\" = The Misanthrope = (孤獨者, dated October 1925) The story's protagonist is a \\"misanthrope\\" because he rejects the bond of people to each other (\\"it is hard to live so that no one will mourn for your death\\") and because he experiences emotion in situations differently than conventional society expects. A major theme of the story is the desire to live and think according to one's own convictions, vs. doing society's bidding. Lu Xun raises the question of whether anyone who tries to go his own way will end up as a \\"wounded wolf.\\" = Regret for the Past = (傷逝, dated October 1925) The \\"true story\\" of what really happens when modern romance (a \\"love match\\") is pursued. A major theme of the story is that \\"honesty\\" and \\"truth\\" (with or without rejection of outmoded traditional marital norms) are not enough to bring about a successful marital relationship. = The Flight to the Moon = (奔月, (OTR), dated December 1926) In this story based on traditional myths and themes, Lu Xun shows that the heroic figure (the intellectual?) and his quest (social crusade?) can sometimes be depressingly mundane. A theme is the idea that humor and imagination are just as important as high purpose in helping people to persevere. Lu Xun likely also wrote this story as retaliation against Lu Xun's formal pupil Kao Chang-hung who attacked Lu Xun in articles. The story of Feng Meng shooting Hou Yi in \\"The Flight to the Moon\\" suggests Kao's attack on Lu Xun. = Forging the Swords = (鑄劍 (OTR), dated October 1926) In another story based on traditional myths and themes, Lu Xun weighs the cost of seeking justice (and, by extension, of wielding the sword of truth), and suggests that great sacrifices are most certainly required in this particular pursuit.

They play in the Leinster Metro League.Leinster Metro League The club colours are sky blue and white hoops. The club was founded in the 1907–08 season as the Carlisle club, based near Parkmore drive in Dublin 6W. A hundred years on, the club had its name changed and they moved to Terenure RFC grounds. At the moment they have two teams, a first XV and an occasional second team for friendlies. History Beginnings at Parkmore Drive: 1907–1945 = Carlisle RFC can trace its history back to the 1907–1908 season. At that time a team drawn from Dublin's Jewish Community, captained by I. Wigoder played a number of games under the name Carlisle RFC. It was so called because similar to the Cricket Club, a number of the founding members lived in Carlisle Street. During 1908 to 1910 Bethel Solomons was capped ten times at Senior International Level for Ireland. The First World War disrupted the club's activities and it re-appears in 1926, sometimes referred to as the “Dublin Jewish Rugby XV”. However, in 1927 the club was formally re-established and affiliated to the IRFU as Carlisle RFC. The man behind this development was Maurice Stein, who was elected captain. Most of the team had never played Rugby before, but they did bring considerable boxing experience with them – an asset of sorts perhaps! Games were played at Parkmore Drive on most Sundays. By 1939 two teams were fielded. It was recalled that Maurice Stein and brother Stanley would bring to every game at least six sets of spare togs so that any team defections could be filled from unsuspecting spectators. Leslie Silverstone who joined in 1938 was still playing for Carlisle 26 years later – quite a unique record. The club continued in full swing during 1940/41, but playing strength was significantly reduced by emigration and, of course, the outbreak of World War II. = Move from Parkmore Drive: 1945–1960 = The club was reborn again in 1945, after the war, and some of the notable players were: Billy Cornick, Ucky Fine, Norman “Doc” Jackson, Sammy Danker, Arnold “Scottie” White, Arthur Barling, Malcolm Glass and Jack Bloom. Bloom captained the team 1946–47 in the minor league, and a successful section was managed by Dr. N. Jackson. In 1948 Arthur Barling was elected chairman, an office he was to hold many times, and Leslie Silverstone captained the side when the Jewish Leeds Institute paid their first visit to Dublin. The 1949–50 season was outstanding from the view of playing strength. Sydney Bloom was captain and his tackling ability has certainly never been surpassed and against a very strong Leeds side, Sydney led a great team to a pulsating in of 19 points to 5. An outstanding player of the team was Stuart Kramm, who ran hard fast. The club vacated Parkmore Drive in 1950 and after a brief spell on an adjoining field, played home games at Sandford Park School, Ranelagh. A highlight of 1951 was when Okie Geffin, one of South Africa’s finest rugby players, attended a special dinner held in his honour. Prior to the new grounds opening at Kimmage, Ernie Harrison captained the team through a difficult season. In 1954, at long last the Kimmage Sports Complex was opened and Mervyn Hool had the privilege of leading the team on to the new pitch. The first official game at the grounds in Kimmage was against Des Hennessey's XV drawn mainly from Palmerston RFC. The club was fortunate to have as its secretary the patient, diplomatic John Finkel. There were many retirees during the fifties, such as Ernie and Dave Harrison, Jack Bloom, Ellis Freedman and Dr. Syd Sugarman. The late Syd Sugerman was for many years medical officer for the Wallabies, the A.R.F.S.U. and N.S.W. Schools Rugby Union rugby teams. Sugerman was Honorary Doctor to the senior Australian team on its tour to Argentina in 1979 and was joint medical advisor to the ARFU and team honorary doctor in 1983 and 1984. In 1984 he was with the team in Fiji and later that year in the UK and Ireland when they won the Grand Slam. He was also honorary medical adviser to the Australian Rugby Football Schools Union from 1980 to 1984. He was particularly well known as a supporter and medical specialist to various groups and teams of schoolboys in the Sydney area. He died on 12/1/1985. After his death the Committee of the ARFSU unanimously agreed to honour Sugerman's contribution to schoolboys rugby by making this award to a member of each team at the Championships. = The glorious years: 1960–1980 = Intervisits continued towards the end of the decade with Brian Ellis as captain. The early sixties proved to be a lean time for the rugby section but thanks to the endeavours of Berk Citron and Ucky Fine, members were gathered from other rugby teams and a whole new generation came into being. This new era carried into the seventies when George Hook took over as coach. Carlisle RFC reached the Spencer Cup final twice and Moran Cup Semi- Final testimony to Georges coaching skill which was subsequently demonstrated with Connacht and the American Eagles among others. The 1927–73 team was: D. Jacobson, L Handleman, EJ Deering, B. White, B. Caldwell, F. McDermot, B. Jacobson, A. Davidson, A. Dargan, A Obernik (Capt), M. Bloom, B. Winn, J. Caplin, J. Phillips, W. Grodkin, M. Samuels, C. Wojner, N. Carey – at that time David White chaired a hard working committee and received plenty of support from PS White, Max Fine, Robert White, Arnold Lewis, Bernard White. Stuart Barling, a long-standing player, became a senior referee, the only Carlisle member to do so. In 1978 a disagreement over club policy led to a most unfortunate split within the rugby section resulting in the loss of several “seasoned” players. Some older members rallied around but playing strength was reduced. Some younger players were brought in such as Niall and Jeremy Jacobs, Eddie Elliman, Alan Traub, Paul Jacobs, Robert Glass, Tevian Mirrelson and Keith Davies. Tragedy struck in 1979 when Kenny Harris (captain) sustained a serious neck injury that ultimately left him paralysed. = New Parkmore RFC: 1980–today = Finally in 1989 the club ended its direct affiliation with Dublin Maccabi and was renamed Parkmore RFC; however, they did remain as tenants in the grounds of Kimmage Road West until it was sold in 1999. Since then, Parkmore RFC have thrived and recently won their first two titles: the J4 Leinster Section C League in 2012 and Leinster Junior Division Champions in 2015, the two first notable win in 105 years of the Carlisle / Parkmore teams playing rugby.

The uprising, which lasted from February to March, primarily affected the lands around the town of Tarnów. rabacja galicyjska in Internetowa encyklopedia PWN It was a revolt against serfdom, directed against manorial property and oppression (for example, the manorial prisons); Galician peasants killed about 1,000 noblemen and destroyed about 500 manors. The Austrian government used the uprising to decimate nationalist Polish nobles, who were organizing an uprising against Austria. Background In the semi-autonomous Free City of Kraków, patriotic Polish intellectuals and nobles (szlachta) had made plans for a general uprising in partitioned Poland, intending to reestablish an independent Poland. A similar uprising of nobility was planned in Poznań, but police quickly caught the ringleaders. The Kraków Uprising began on the night of 20 February, and initially met with limited successes. In the meantime, the recent poor harvests resulted in significant unrest among the local peasantry. Uprising The Kraków uprising was a spark that ignited the peasants' rebellion. The insurgent nobles made appeals to the peasants, reminding them of the popular hero Tadeusz Kościuszko and promising an end to serfdom. Some peasants indeed sided with the nobles. Narkiewicz and Hahn, among others, note that the peasants around Kraków, many of whom remembered the promises made by Kościuszko and peasant soldiers who fought beside him, were sympathetic to the noble insurgents. Another account is of the peasants in Chochołów, who gathered under a Polish flag and fought the Austrians. Most sources agree that the Austrians encouraged the peasants to revolt. A number of sources point to the actions of the Austrian Tarnów administration, in particular an official identified as the District Officer of Tarnów, Johann Breindl von Wallerstein. Wallerstein reached out to peasant leader Jakub Szela. Serfs were promised the end of their feudal duties if they helped to put down the insurgent Polish noblemen, and were also paid in money and salt for the heads of nobles. Hahn notes \\"it is generally accepted as proven that the Austrian authorities deliberately exploited peasant dissatisfaction in order to suppress the national uprising.\\" Magosci et al. write that \\"most contemporaries condemned the Austrian authorities for their perfidious use of the peasantry for counter-revolutionary aims.\\" It was ironic, as historian Eric Hobsbawm has noted, that the peasants turned their anger on the revolutionaries, whose ideals also included improvement of the peasants' situation. The progressive ideals of the Polish insurgents were praised, among others, by Karl Marx, who called it a \\"deeply democratic movement that aimed at land reform and other pressing social questions\\". As noted by several historians, the peasants were not so much acting out of loyalty to the Austrians, as revolting against the oppressive feudal system, of which the Polish nobles were prime representatives and beneficiaries in the Galician region. Wolff takes a different stance here, by noting that it is likely that the Austrian authorities held greater sway with the peasants, who saw improvement in their living conditions in the recent decades, which they associated with the new Austrian rule. Peasants were paid in money and salt for the heads of nobles Bideleux and Jeffries (2007) are among the dissenters to that view, citing Alan Sked's 1989 research that contends that \\"the Habsburg authorities – despite later chargers of connivance – knew nothing about what was going on and were appalled at the results of the blood-lust.\\" Hahn notes that during the events of 1846 \\"the Austrian bureaucracy played a dubious role that has not been completely explained, down to the present day.\\" The peasants also aided the Austrian army in defeating the insurgents at the battle of Gdów. Peasants attacked the manor houses of the rebel noble leaders as well as of suspected rebel nobles and killed many hundreds of the estate owners and their families; about 90% of the manor houses in the Tarnów region are estimated to have been destroyed. At least 470 manor houses were destroyed. Estimates of the number of lives lost by Polish estate owners and officials range from 1,000 to 2,000. Jezierski notes that most of the victims were not nobles (he estimates those constituted maybe about 200 of the fatalities) but their direct employees. Most of the victims had no direct involvement with the Polish insurgents other than being a part of the same social class. (Davies also notes that near Bochnia, Austrian officials were attacked by overzealous peasantry.) Bideleux and Jeffries discuss the total number of victims noting that \\"more than two thousand lives were lost on both sides\\", which suggests that most of the victims were from among the Polish nobility. The uprising was eventually put down by Austrian troops. Accounts of the pacification vary. Bideleux and Jeffries note it was \\"brutally put down by the Austrian troops\\". Jezierski notes the use of flagellation by the authorities. Nance describes the arrest and exile of the anti-Austrian peasants in Chochołów. Magocsi et al. note that the peasants were punished by being forced to resume their feudal obligations, while their leader, Szela, received a medal and a land grant. Legacy Serfdom, with corvée labor, existed in Galicia until 1848, and the 1846 massacre of Polish szlachta is credited with helping to bring on its demise. The destruction of crops during the hostilities was one of the reasons for the ensuing famine. For the Polish nobles and reformers, this event was a lesson that class lines are a powerful force, and that peasants cannot be expected to support a cause of independent Poland without education and reform. Soon after the uprising was put down, the Republic of Krakow was abolished and incorporated into Galicia. The massacre of the gentry in 1846 was the historical memory that haunted Stanisław Wyspiański's play The Wedding. The uprising was also described in the stories \\"Der Kreisphysikus\\" and \\"Jacob Szela\\" by Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach.  See also  * Revolutions of 1848 Notes a The nationality of the peasants is a complex issue.

Historia Polski. by Michał Tymowski, Jan Kieniewicz, Jerzy Holzer. Warszawa. 1990. str. 234 Hahn notes that the peasants in the region affected by the uprising were not Ruthenian, but rather \\"Polish speaking Catholics\\". Others, however, note that the peasants had little national identity and considered themselves Masurians; to quote one of the peasants as late as end of World War I: \\"The older peasants called themselves Masurians, and their speech Masurian ... I myself did not know that I was a Pole till I began to read books and papers, and I fancy that other villagers came to be aware of the national attachment in much the same way.\\" In turn Wolff prefers to talk of \\"Galician peasants\\".

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) Anthony Hawke on his appointment to be a High Court judge. Electoral history Hawke had first won the seat at the 1922 general election. He lost it to the Liberal candidate Sir Clifford Cory at the 1923 general election when there was also a Labour candidate in the field but won it back from Cory in a straight fight in 1924. Candidates *The Unionists picked Sir Andrew Caird (1870-1956) one of Lord Northcliffe’s newspaper editors and directors The Times, 17 December 1956 to defend the seat. *The Liberal Party challenger was Hilda Runciman, the wife of leading Liberal MP, Rt Hon. Walter Runciman. *The Reverend Frederick Jesse Hopkins, intervened for the Labour Party. Campaign The by-election was a three-cornered contest, though given the electoral history of the seat it was always regarded as a two-horse race between Unionist and Liberal. The circumstances in which Mrs Runciman came to be selected as Liberal candidate were an issue in the by- election. Her husband, Walter Runciman who was Liberal MP for Swansea West had decided to transfer from Swansea to St Ives at the next general election. When the by-election was caused by Hawke’s resignation, Mrs Runciman was adopted as Liberal candidate to keep the seat warm for her husband. This attracted Tory derision.Roy Douglas, Liberals: The History of the Liberal and Liberal Democrat Parties; Hambledon and London, 2005 p215 Apparently Liberal party leader David Lloyd George did not approve of Mrs Runciman’s candidacy and he sent no message of support for her during the by-election. However, Deputy Leader Sir Herbert Samuel did travel to the constituency to speak on her behalf.Pamela Brookes, Women at Westminster; Peter Davies Publishing, 1967 p65 Result The result was a victory for Mrs Runciman, who overturned Hawke’s majority of 1,247 to win by a majority of 763 votes. Runciman was the third woman parliamentary candidate ever to be elected for the Liberal Party, after Margaret Wintringham and Vera Terrington. On election she joined her husband in the House of Commons, the first married couple to sit in the House together.Brookes, op cit p65 Aftermath Runciman duly stood down in her husband’s favour at the 1929 general election and he held the seat for the Liberal Party, again defeating Caird. Runciman sought re-election at the General Election of 1929 at the Unionist held seat of Tavistock, but finished second. Hopkins also moved to contest Penryn & Falmouth and again finished third. This was seen as one of the two ‘warming pan’ by-elections in the 1924-1929 Parliament, with Hugh Dalton's wife successfully contested the 1929 Bishop Auckland by-election with her husband contesting it at the 1929 general election.Brookes, op cit p65-66  References  * *  See also  * List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918–1931) *Politics of Cornwall Category:By- elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Cornish constituencies Category:1928 in England Category:1928 elections in the United Kingdom Category:St Ives, Cornwall Category:20th century in Cornwall ","title":"1928 St Ives by-election"},{"id":"20856409","text":"INGRA d.d. is a Croatian construction company.

Built about 1928, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, noted for its Colonial Revival styling. These details have been lost or obscured by later exterior siding installation (see photo). Description and history The Andrew Friberg Three-Decker is located in Worcester's southeastern Vernon Hill neighborhood, at the southwest corner of Ames and Stockton Streets. It is a three-story wood frame structure, covered by a gabled roof and finished with synthetic siding. Its main facade is asymmetrical, with bands of three sash windwos on the left side, and a projecting stack of porches on the right. Both the main roof and the porch projection have fully pedimented gables. The house was built about 1928, during the last major phase of development in the Vernon Hill area. It is differentiated from earlier triple-deckers by the lack of a projecting polygonal bay, the usual accompaniment to the porch stack. A band of three windows is also found on the building's side, where earlier triple-deckers also often had a projecting bay. When the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, it was noted for its Colonial Revival styling, including porches supported by Tuscan columns and banded decorative shingling between the floors. Andrew Friberg, the building's first owner, was a Swedish immigrant laborer who also lived here. Other early residents were of Swedish and Irish origin.

LifeEarly life= Louise Seidler was born on 15 May 1786 was born to an academic in the university in Jena. She spent her youth with her grandmother (under whom she learned music and drawing) then on her grandmother's death was adopted by the wife of a doctor Stieler at Gotha. Her love of art was only developed under the sculptor Friedrich Wilhelm Eugen Döll, who had returned to Gotha after an eleven-year stay in Rome. =Return to Jena= Back in Jena she lived in her father's house, next door to Goethe's home in Jena's Schloss, getting to know him in her childhood. In Jena she also became friends with Silvie von Ziegesar and Pauline Gotter, later wife of the Jena professor Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling. Louise Seidler gained full admission to intellectual circles in the city, which then included Friedrich Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt, the brothers Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel, Friedrich Tieck, Clemens Brentano, Voß, Paulus, Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer, Zacharias Werner and others. Goethe mainly met her in the house of the publisher Carl Friedrich Ernst Frommann, and began to become highly interested in her. =Marriage= On 14 October 1806 the French won the battle of Jena and in 1806 and 1807 occupied Jena, exposing its inhabitants to troop billeting and plunder. During this time Louise fell in love with and married the physician Geoffroy, in the corps of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte. On orders received before his wedding he was then posted to Spain, where he soon afterwards died of fever in a military hospital. Her parents then sent the widowed Louise to Dresden to divert her from her mourning and scatter her gloomy thoughts. =Early painting career= Visiting the Dresdner Kunstgalerie, which had also impressed Goethe, she decided to become a painter and progressed fast, having become a pupil of the painter and teacher Christian Leberecht Vogel, who taught her for free. Goethe stayed in Dresden for 10 days on his trip back from Karlsbad, and was so pleased with Louise's copy of Carlo Dolce's \\"Saint Cecilia\\" that he invited her to Weimar, where she painted his portrait. Until her mother's death on 23 September 1814 she spent the winter months in Weimar and Jena and the summer months in Dresden, undergoing further training with the painter Gerhard von Kügelgen. In winter 1811 she was invited to Gotha by duke Augustus to paint him, his second wife Karoline Amalie and Princess Louise (his daughter by his first marriage). Further work there followed on later stays. Her mother's death on 23 September 1814 marked a break in her life, since she returned to her father in Jena as head of the household, though she still saw success in her artistic work. =Rochuskapelle in Bingen= In 1816 Louise completed an altarpiece of \\"Saint Roch\\", on designs by Heinrich Meyer for the Rochuskapelle in Bingen, that he had described in 1814 as \\"On the Rhine, Main and Neckar\\". This chapel had been rebuilt from ruins and was rededicated on 16 August 1814 (St Roch's feast day), with Goethe participating in the ceremonies. The altarpiece began a correspondence between him and Louise, in which he expressed his happiness in the work. =Munich (1817-18)= Thanks to Goethe she received a one-year scholarship of 400 Taler from duke Charles Augustus to go to Munich for a year's further training in painting. On 4 July 1817 she travelled to Munich and, with letters of recommendation from Goethe, was welcomed into the house of the philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi. In Munich she again met her friend Pauline Gotter, who in 1812 had married the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling, and in her house met the Swedish poet Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom. Previously under the influence of the academy director Langer, Louise's painting style now became more independent as she moved from copying others' artworks to studying nature (which she had previously neglected). Even so, she still copied Raphael's \\"Portrait of Bindo Altoviti\\" in Munich for the Duke and produced a drawing of the friezes of Leo von Klenze's Apollotempel at the Nymphenburg Palace for Goethe. The duke then granted her request for a further scholarship in Italy, again of 400 Taler. =Italy (1818-23)= Seidler in Rome 1820; by Carl Christian Vogel von Vogelstein On 20 September 1818 Louise set out on her trip to Italy, arriving in Rome the following 30 October. She lived in the artistic circle of the city (usually based on the Pincian Hill), also frequented by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and the brothers Johann and Philipp Veit. In the German colony of painters and sculptors she found a way in to the artistic and social life of the city and its expatriates. She was welcomed into the houses of Barthold Georg Niebuhr (Prussian envoy to the Vatican) and of the wife of Wilhelm von Humboldt. In spring 1819 she spent many months in Naples and in autumn 1820 in Florence, in order to copy Raphael's \\"Madonna del Granduca\\" and \\"Madonna del cardellino\\" (both in the Uffizi) for grand-duke Charles Augustus. The painter Friedrich Preller was so impressed by her copies that he called them \\"the best known copies I know\\". A further copy, of \\"The Tempi Madonna\\", was bought by king Louis I of Bavaria in 1826 for the Pinakothek in Munich. In late autumn 1821 she left Florence for Rome. In April and May 1822 she copied \\"The Violin Players\\", with the copy later a part of the collection at the Schloss Sanssouci in Potsdam. At the same time she began her own painting \\"Saint Elizabeth handing out alms\\". In reports Louise called her time in Italy the happiest of her life, but this period came to a sudden end when in 1823 she received news that her father had fallen seriously ill and she had to return to Germany. =Return to Weimar= Only on her return to Weimar did she find time to complete her work \\"Saint Elizabeth handing out alms\\". On the recommendation of Goethe and Johann Heinrich Meyer duke Charles Augustus put her in charge of the education of his daughter Maria and Augusta. On her father's death she was able to return to Italy, but was prevented from doing so when in 1824 Charles Augustus made her custodian of the grand-ducal art collection in Weimar's Grossen Jägerhaus. Except for a few journeys Louise remained in Weimar and was highly appreciated in society circles. She led a lively correspondence with personalities such as Philipp Veit and his wife Karoline and wife Dorothea Schlegel, among others. It was mainly due to her that Herr von Quandt created the Saxonian Art Association and that Goethe gave that association his active support. Right up to his death in 1832 Goethe was grateful to Louise for her promotion of his career (and vice versa) and his death put her into deep mourning. With Mrs von Bardeleben, in autumn 1832, she went on a second trip to Italy, lasting just over a year. Above all she maintained her relations with the painter Friedrich Preller, who inspired her to paint religious and devotional paintings, which diverted her from artistic work after her return from Italy, with her increasing blindness towards the end of her life also preventing the completion of many works. Literary work Before her death she wrote her autobiography \\"Erinnerungen aus dem Leben der Malerin Louise Seidler\\" (Memories from the Life of the Painter Louise Seidler), published by Hermann Uhde in 1873 and which is still one of the most important art historical sources for the time.

The Arkansas Razorbacks defeated the Texas Longhorns 27–6. The Texas Longhorns finished their regular season 9-3 and were champions of the Big 12 South. However, a 22–6 loss to #3 Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game sent them to the Cotton Bowl Classic. Arkansas, on the other hand, finished the regular season at 7–4, and accepted an at-large bid out of the Southeastern Conference. This was the first meeting between the former Southwest Conference rivals since Arkansas left the now defunct league after the 1991 season, to join the SEC. Arkansas won the last meeting in 1991, 14–13. The game was a defensive struggle in the first half, with the teams tied 3–3 at halftime. After Arkansas took a 10–3 lead, Texas settled for a field goal to cut Arkansas' lead to 10–6. A huge goal line stand by the Razorbacks kept the Horns out of the end zone, turning the ball over to the Hogs on downs inside the one yard line. Arkansas QB Clint Stoerner threw from his own end zone to a streaking Anthony Lucas to get the ball across mid- field, on a huge third down play. Texas QB Major Applewhite injured his knee in the second half, and was replaced by freshman Chris Simms. The result was the same for Texas, as Arkansas' defense dogged the Longhorn offense all game long. Arkansas freshman RB Cedric Cobbs finally broke free of the Texas defense for a 37-yard touchdown run, and Arkansas scored 17 unanswered points en route to a 27–6 victory. For his role in the win, Cedric Cobbs was named the Offensive MVP of the Game. Senior defensive tackle D. J. Cooper was the Defensive MVP. The swarming Razorbacks defense held Texas to negative rushing yards, and sacked the Longhorn quarterbacks a total of 8 times. This was Arkansas' first bowl victory in fifteen years (1985 Holiday Bowl), and their first Cotton Bowl championship since winning the 1976 Cotton Bowl Classic over Georgia, 31–10.

The book was scheduled for publication by Berkley Books in February 2009, but its publication was canceled on December 27, 2008, when it was discovered that the book's central events were untrue. Prior to being exposed as a fabrication, the film rights to the book were purchased for $25 million by producer Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures. Other fans of the story included Oprah Winfrey, who described it as the single greatest love story she had heard in 22 years of doing her show. The story Fabricated by Rosenblat, the story states that, beginning in the winter of 1944, a nine-year-old Jewish girl, posing as a Christian from a local farm, met Rosenblat at the electrified perimeter fence of the Schlieben concentration camp and tossed him an apple over the fence. She continued passing him food for seven months until he was transferred to another camp. According to Rosenblat, they met in 1957 on a blind date at Coney Island, New York, and, while relating their personal histories, discovered their shared past. Shortly afterwards, they married. Authenticity questioned Several Holocaust scholars, including Deborah Lipstadt, raised questions about “the central premise of his narrative — that a girl met him at the fence and that very girl became his wife,” and suggested that that premise \\"is, at the very least, an embellishment, and at worst, a wholesale fabrication.\\" Friends and family members also raised questions about the truth of statements in the book. Professor Kenneth Waltzer, director of the Jewish Studies program at Michigan State University, stated that maps of Schlieben indicate that neither prisoners nor civilians could have approached the perimeter fence because one could only obtain access immediately next to the SS barracks. Waltzer also determined that Rosenblat's wife, as well as her family, were hidden as Christians at a farm near Breslau, 210 miles away from Schlieben. A number of researchers, including forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen Fitzpatrick, as well as several Holocaust survivors, worked with Waltzer in uncovering the deception and bringing it to the attention of reporters. Rosenblat and the publisher initially maintained that the story was truthful. Berkley Books subsequently stated that it was \\"canceling publication of Angel at the Fence after receiving new information from Herman Rosenblat's agent, Andrea Hurst,\\" and \\"will demand that the author and the agent return all money that they have received for this work.\\" Rosenblat, who was in fact imprisoned in Schlieben, has acknowledged that the story of meeting his wife there was invented.Conan, Neal (December 29, 2008).

The book was planned to be published in 2009 by Berkley Books, but was cancelled after it turned out that many elements of his memoir were fabricated and some were contrary to verifiable historical facts.

Before the fabrication became public, the film rights to the book were purchased for $25 million by Harris Salomon of Atlantic Overseas Pictures. Other fans of the story include Oprah Winfrey who has described it as the single greatest love story she heard in over 22 years of hosting her show. The story behind Rosenblat's story is being developed as an independent feature film. In June 2010 Atlantic Overseas Pictures and producer Harris Salomon signed a co-production agreement with Castel Film Studios, a well known studio in Central and Eastern Europe and the studio for Cold Mountain and Borat as well as 3rd-i films in London, to produce a feature film about the Herman Rosenblat affair based on an original screenplay by award-winning screenwriter Ivo Marloh entitled The Apple, scheduled for production in 2015. Life Rosenblat, a Polish Jew, lived in the town of Piotrków Trybunalski before World War II. Following the invasion of Poland, the Nazis rounded up his family in 1939 along with thousands of others when the Piotrków Trybunalski Ghetto was set up. His father had previously died of typhus. Two years later, when Rosenblat was 12 years old, his mother was separated from him and put on a Holocaust train to Treblinka extermination camp during one of the ghetto liquidation actions. About 90% of the inhabitants of the ghetto were sent to Majdanek and Treblinka death camps. He later wrote that he lied to the Germans about his age because the Nazis used older boys for slave labor, and sent younger ones for extermination. In July 1944, with the front lines approaching, he was deported with his three older brothers to Schlieben sub- camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, until February 1945. He claimed in his memoir that his future wife Roma, a nine-year-old Jewish girl hiding in the town of Schlieben with her family, threw him apples and bread over the electrified, guarded fence of the camp on a daily basis throughout the seven months' period. Shortly before liberation he was brought to the Theresienstadt camp. After being liberated from the concentration camps, Rosenblat and his brothers were brought to the UK in a group of 730 orphans to start a new life. Rosenblat says he lived in London for four years, where he learned the electrical trade at the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training school. He then moved to the United States in 1950 and was drafted into the United States Army in 1951. After serving for two years, he says he moved to New York and opened his own TV repair shop in Brooklyn. He met Roma Radzicki in the United States on a blind date in 1957, and married her. He later claimed that during the date he had recognized her as the girl who threw apples to him over the fence and proposed on the spot.Cohen, Zen (December 14, 2008). Couple's story of love started in time of war Miami Herald Holocaust survival hoaxInvention and rise to fame= In 1992 Rosenblat and his wife had run into serious financial problems after the Rosenblat family were victims of an armed robbery that left his son, Kenneth Rosenblat, in a wheelchair and left Rosenblat critically injured. Rosenblat invented the story in the hospital while recovering. Rosenblat stated that his mother had appeared to him at the hospital and had told him to tell his story to the world. In 1994 Rosenblat had a tax lien placed on him by the IRS for unpaid payroll taxes dating back to 1988, which must have increased the financial pressure on him. According to Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer, Rosenblat changed his own story, replacing it with the love story, and then it must have become difficult to turn back. After he had won Oprah's contest of love stories he had to keep lying and live with it. Rosenblat told the apple story for the first time in late 1995, and he won Oprah's contest in 1996. Oprah Winfrey interviewed Rosenblat in two different programs, in 1996 and 2007, and she called his story \\"the single greatest love story, in 22 years of doing this show, we’ve ever told on the air.\\" Berkley Books, an imprint of the Penguin Group, signed Rosenblat up to publish his memoir Angel at the Fence, with Andrea Hurst working as Rosenblat's literary agent. Producer Harris Salomon, of Atlantic Overseas Pictures, made plans to adapt the story into a $25 million movie called The Flower at the Fence, and he had earlier registered a screenplay based on the story with the Library of Congress in 2003. =Discovery of hoax= Jewish professor Deborah Lipstadt had already denounced the story in her personal blog in December 2007. Other Holocaust survivors like Peter Kubicek also denounced the implausibility of the story. Jewish-American blogger Danny Bloom started emailing several historians for help, one of them being Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer. Waltzer had been interviewing survivors for a new book, and he had been told that the story was probably false. In November 2008 Waltzer contacted forensic genealogists Sharon Sergeant and Colleen Fitzpatrick and started investigating the matter. He found out that the prisoners of that concentration camp were prohibited from approaching a camp's fence on pain of death, nor was anyone allowed to approach a fence from the outside. Such perimeter fences were electrified and watched 24/7 by armed guards stationed on guard towers, ready to shoot anyone who approached the fence from either side. The SS barracks were near to the only fence that faced outwards, and prisoners approaching the barracks would have been executed. Waltzer also discovered that Herman's future wife Roma was never in the town of Schlieben, but that she lived throughout that period in a German farm away, near Breslau. Another survivor of the same camp, Ben Helfgott, told him that Rosenblat had never told the story before the mid-1990s.Caleb Daniloff, Untrue Stories, a genealogist reveals the painful truth about three Holocaust memoirs: they're fiction. Bostonia (Alumni Magazine of Boston University) Waltzer started questioning the publisher and the agent about the authenticity of the story, with little success. Some people actively resisted and tried to shut down his investigation. On December 25 and 26, 2008, several scholars and family members published multiple critical articles in The New Republic, the first article using Waltzer's research, and the second adding their own research on top of Waltzer's. On December 27 Rosenblat finally confessed the truth to the producer of his movie, Harris Solomon, and his literary agent, Andrea Hurst. He stated that the apple-tossing part of his backstory was something he only imagined, while stating that the rest of his Holocaust experiences were accurate, however other falsehoods and discrepancies in his remaining story have been discovered since then.Italie, Hillel (December 28, 2008). Anger, sadness over fabricated Holocaust story. Associated PressBarrios, Jennifer (December 28, 2008). Holocaust survivor Herman Rosenblat recants story. Newsday Rosenblat has not apologized, and claimed that \\"It was my imagination, and in my mind, I believed it. Even now, I believe it.\\", and he also said that he did it to bring happiness and hope to people. His family knew about the hoax and tried to convince Rosenblat not to tell it. This caused a division in Rosenblat's family. His last surviving brother, Sam, had hesitated talking to him and he died in 2007. Herman's two children were very uncomfortable with the matter. Despite not agreeing with Rosenblat, the family never revealed the truth to the media or Rosenblat's publishers or producers. The other orphans from Buchenwald knew that the story was very implausible but decided not to say anything. As time passed, the persons knowing about the hoax grew more uncomfortable about keeping silent about it and there was a growing consensus that the truth had to be told. =Reaction to discovery= On December 27, 2008, the same day of Rosenblat's confession, Berkley Group cancelled the book publication, saying that it had received \\"new information\\" from Rosenblat's agent. A spokesman said that they would be asking for the money back that they had advanced, and the company has declined making any more comments on the matter. A children's edition of the book, written by a third party, Laurie Friedman of Miami, titled Angel Girl, had been released in September 2008. When Lerner Books learned that the book was based on Rosenblat's falsehoods they said that they wouldn't make any reprint and that they would refund any returned copy. About 2,000 copies were sold. Producer Harris Salomon wasn't aware of Rosenblat's hoax when he started working on his movie of the Rosenblat story, but still intends to produce it, as he had always planned a \\"loose and fictionalised adaptation\\" and \\"the story retains its power to grip audiences worldwide.\\" He had been working with Rosenblat over a six-year period as the original feature film was being developed. According to Salomon, the script for the feature was completed in October 2009 with casting to commence by Celestia Fox in London. Producers Abi Sirokh, Gabor Koltai, Lew Rywin and Thierry Potok contributed to the project. The new motion picture tells the story of Herman Rosenblat, with a style similar to the movie The Insider. After the revelation of the hoax, the focus of the film was changed to a psychological love story examining why a Holocaust survivor would make up a story about the Holocaust and the love for his wife while driven by greed, fame and the memory of the Holocaust. Salomon has asked Rosenblat to donate all the earnings of the film to Holocaust survivor charities but Rosenblat refused. Oprah posted a disclaimer on her website, and in February 2009 she said that she was \\"disappointed\\", but she denied having been duped by Rosenblat and that she was \\"minding my own business.\\" Gayle King, a friend of Oprah's, pointed out that a lot of other people had also been duped and that she was being scapegoated. In July 2009 a new video was disseminated by the gawker.com web site. Rosenblat is re-enacting his Holocaust love story, specifically the throwing of apples over the perimeter fence of the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, long after that part of his story had been discredited as fake.Lying Holocaust Author Recounts Tale of Thing That Never Happened , gawker.com On September 1, 2009, York House Press published a paperback book titled The Apple, written by Penelope Holt. It tells Rosenblat's life story.official site of The Apple novel Peter Kubicek, an outspoken critic of the original book, reportedly advised the author and is thanked in the preface of the book. =Analysis and repercussions= Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer said that it was disturbing that so few people had noticed and inquired about the obvious holes in his history over a decade. Waltzer and others have said that Rosenblat didn't need to embellish his story, which was already powerful enough by itself.interview , to professor Michael Berenbaum in CBS Waltzer places part of the blame in all those \\"culture makers\\" that profited from the diffusion of the story and never doubted even the most implausible parts of it. It appears that the veracity of story was not questioned either by the book publisher or by Oprah Winfrey, and that no fact- checking was done to ensure the authenticity of the memoir prior to endorsing it soundly. Deborah Lipstadt and others have harshly criticized Rosenblat for embellishing his story, since this could cause people to doubt the truth of the Holocaust, and encourage Holocaust deniers. According to Fitzpatrick, one of Waltzer's collaborators, such hoaxes could be avoided if the publishers spent a few thousand dollars in early fact-checking with historians and genealogists, before deciding to spend huge sums of money for the story. Among a number of other false elements in Rosenblat's story, he claimed that he was scheduled to be gassed at 10am on May 10, 1945, and that the liberation saved him by just two hours. The war ended officially on May 8, and the entire camp had been handed over to the International Red Cross a week earlier. Theresienstadt had no gas chambers and, as noted by Deborah Lipstadt: \\"Jewish prisoners were not told ahead of time that they were going to be gassed.\\"Elizabeth Day.

Instructional simulations are typically goal oriented and focus learners on specific facts, concepts, or applications of the system or environment. Today, most universities make lifelong learning possible by offering a virtual learning environment (VLE). Not only can users access learning at different times in their lives, but they can also immerse themselves in learning without physically moving to a learning facility, or interact face to face with an instructor in real time. Such VLEs vary widely in interactivity and scope. For example, there are virtual classes, virtual labs, virtual programs, virtual library, virtual training, etc. Researchers have classified VLE in 4 types: * 1st generation VLE: They originated in 1992, and provided the first on line course opportunities. They consisted in a collection of learning materials, discussion forums, testing and e-mail systems all accessible on line. This type of virtual environment was static, and did not allow for interaction among the different components of the system. * 2nd generation VLE: Originated in 1996, these VLE are more powerful, both in data base integration and functions - planning and administrating, creating and supporting teaching materials, testing and analyzing results. Over 80 forms exist, including Learning Space, WebCT, Top Class, COSE, Blackboard, etc. * 3rd generation VLE: The novelty of 3rd generation VLE is that they incorporate the newest technologies, accessible in real and non real time (synchronous and synchronous communications), such as audio and video conferences through the internet -‘one to one’ and ‘one to many’, collaboration features for work in groups, seminars, labs, forums, and of course the learning, development, planning, library and administrative functions. Stanford On-line, InterLabs, Classroom 2000 and the system \\"Virtual University\\" (VU) are examples of this VLE. * 4th generation VLE: These are the environments of the future, and represent new learning paradigms, at the center of which are the user and the ‘global resources,’ as opposed to the teacher and the ‘local resources.’ Their main advantage is that learning materials can be created, adapted and personalized to the specific needs and function of each user. Few 4th generations VLE exist, most of them still being in the planning and developing phases. One example of supportive technology is called the ‘multi-agent technology,’ which allows the interface of data among different systems.Ivanova, Angel Smrikarov, A (2004). \\"Some Approaches to Implementation of Virtual Learning Environments. International Conference on Computer Systems and Technologies - CompSysTech’2004. Retrieved on 6/26/09 http://ecet.ecs.uni-ruse.bg/cst04/Docs/sIV/425.pdf  History  Simulations of one form or another have been used since the early 1900s as a method for training or training. The United States Defense Modeling and Simulation Coordination Office identifies three main types of simulation: live, virtual, and constructive. Live (live action) and virtual simulations are primarily used for training purposes, whereas a constructive simulation is used to view or predict outcomes like wargaming or stockmarket behavior. Each of these types is based on some reality and is intended to provide the user with a pseudo-experience without the danger, expense, or complexity of real life. While simulations are used for learning and training purposes, noted authors, such as Clark AldrichClark Aldrich and Andy GibbonsAndy Gibbons (Model- Centered Instruction) suggest that simulations in and of themselves are not instructional. Rather, a simulation only becomes instructional when instructional elements are included that help expose the learner to key parts or concepts of the system or environment. For example, an F-16 simulator is not inherently instructional because it is primarily intended to replicate the F-16 cockpit behavior and the environments the aircraft operates within. The simulator may be used for training purposes, but it requires an instructor or some other external element to identify key learning aspects of the system to the learner. In education, simulations have had their use under a number of different names. Ken JonesKen Jones in the 1980s defined simulations as interactions between people such as role-playing. Others suggest that experiential learning activities like those found in team training or ropes courses are also simulations because they replicate the human decision-making processes groups may display, albeit in a very different environment. These can be considered instructional simulations because the effective use of these simulation types include using instructional elements to help learners focus on key behaviors, concepts or principles. With the ever decreasing cost of computing tools, virtual and constructive simulation are being used more and more. Simulation is used more and more in e-learning environments because of improved Web-authoring tools and an increasing demand for performance-based training. As a result, more non-technical personnel are involved designing simulation, a field dominated by engineers and computer scientists.  Instructional design models for simulations  Most traditional instructional design models have at least four components:Main, R. (1997). Integrating motivation into the design process. Educational Technology, 33(12), 38-39 * Analysis – components usually included are a goal analysis, performance analysis, target population analysis, task analysis, media selection, and cost analysis. * Design – including interface design, sequencing, lesson design, and learner control * Development – a collaboration between programmers, graphic artists, writers, subject matter experts, and others during which the educational product is fully developed * Implementation and Evaluation – delivering the final product to the learners and evaluating whether the goals were met. ADDIE is an example of an Instructional Systems Design (ISD) model.  Effectiveness of pedagogy  When designing VLEs more functions need to be considered than in designing traditional learning modalities. The process of virtual learning consists of organizational, quality control, correctional and predictable procedures. For example, the effectiveness of the organization of student self-learning - called the ‘pedagogical and didactical function’ in VLEs, will depend on the following: # Online content that satisfies the requirements of subject matter standards, while at the same time allows engages students ‘interest in the process of learning. For example, open ended inquiry-based approaches to learning allow students to have some room to pursue individual interests. # Level of interactivity of learning environment, to increase motivation and hands-on opportunities for learners. Simulation and animation provide excellent multisensory learning environments. # Time management tools for the efficient assimilation of new materials. For example, availability of timetables, schedule of synchronous consultations, embedded hyperlinks for the ready access of information, etc. # Maximization of activities that focus on student critical thinking, and information literacy skills, needed for the 21st century, such as acquisition, processing and synthesis of information. # Communication modalities between teacher and student, peer to peer and learner to experts. The role of the instructor is that of an organizer, while the student is an initiator of the learning process. A widely used format for designing online learning environments is WebQuest. However, there are today on the market newer models for instruction that are more interactive and integrated, such as Project Page, MiniQuest, CuriculumQuest, DecisionQuest. Reference: Jakes, D.

Retrieved on 6/28/09: http://www.biopoint.com/ibr/techforum.htm Since the 1990s, trends such as the performance technology movement, constructivism, Electronic Performance Support Systems, rapid prototyping, increasing use of Internet for distance education/distance learning, and knowledge management endeavors have influenced instructional design practices These changes are producing challenges to existing design models. According to Reigeluth (1996), the education and training field is in the midst of a paradigm shift from the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age, requiring a corresponding shift from standardization to customization of instructional design. Moreover, Gros et al. (1997), posit the inflexibility of traditional linear design processes, calling for a more iterative process, while Winn (1997) and Jonassen et al. criticize the positivist assumptions that learning situations are closed systems, imparting knowledge is the instructor's responsibility, and that human behavior is predictable.Akilli, G. (2007). Games and simulations: A new approach in education? In D. Gibson, C. Aldrich & M. Prensky (Eds.), Games and simulations in online learning: Research and development frameworks. Hershey PA: Information Science Pub. p. 9 There are many alternative models that have been proposed as more conducive to the new Information Age paradigm, including new methods of instruction such as instructional gaming and simulations – Jonassen's promotion of hermeneutics, fuzzy logic and chaos theory as bases for ID, Hoffman's use of Reigeleuth's Elaboration Theory and hypermedia,Akilli & Cagiltay's FIDGE model, among others.Akilli, 2007, 11 = Hermeneutics, fuzzy logic, and chaos theory = Hermeneutics emphasizes the importance of socio-historical context in mediating the meanings of individuals creating and decoding texts. Massively multiplayer online learning environments, for example, require new social processes that go well with social constructivist, hermeneutic philosophy and methods. Chaos theory looks for order in chaotic systems, looking for repeating patterns such as fractals. It is useful for non-linear, dynamic situations or for situations where a small change in initial conditions can produce great changes later. Finally, fuzzy logic is based on the idea that reality is rarely bivalent, but rather multivalent – in other words, there are many \\"in-between\\" values that need to be designed for. Therefore, instructional models should move away from deterministic approaches and design for more probabilistic ways of thinking.Jonassen, D. et al.(1997). Certainty, determinism, and predictability in theories of instructional design: Lessons from science. Educational Technology, 37(1), 27-34. = Elaboration theory (ET) and hypermedia = Key aspects of ET are: * A single organizing structure that reflects the primary focus of the course. * Sequencing from simple to complex * Sequence within the lesson: --For conceptually organized instruction \\"present the easiest, most familiar organizing concepts first\\" (p. 251). ** For procedures, \\"present the steps in order of their performance\\" ** For theoretically organized instruction, move from simple to complex. ** Place supporting content immediately after related organizing content. ** Adhere to learning prerequisite relationships in the content. ** Present coordinate concepts simultaneously rather than serially. ** Teach the underlying principle before its associated procedure.Wilson, B., & Cole, P. (1992). A critical review of elaboration theory. Educational Technology Research and Development, 40 (3), 63-79. Hoffman states that \\"the Web-like linking that characterizes hypermedia is more alike to the functioning of human cognition than is the traditional linear structure found in much educational programming\\", further asserting that \\"this kind of model could lead to the possibility of modularity and plasticity, which would bring along the ease to make changes in response to learner needs without changing the overall structure of the product and rapid development.\\"Akilli, 2007 = FIDGE (Fuzzified Instructional Design Development of Game-Like Environments) model = This model consists of dynamic phases with fuzzy boundaries, through which instructional designers move non-linearly.Akilli, 13-15 The main features are: * The participants include all actively participating learners and experts * Teams are composed of multidisciplinary, multi-skilled game-players * The environment is socio-organizational and cultural * The process is dynamic, fuzzy, non-linear, and creative * Based on evaluation, change is continuous * Evaluation is also continuous, iterative, formative and summative, embedded into each phase * Time management and scheduling is vital for success, as well as the management of a good leader * The model is suitable for game-like learning environments and educational games, for novice to expert level instructional designers and learners.  Virtual worlds in instructional simulation  A virtual world is an interactive 3-D environment where users are immersed in the environment. Users can manipulate the environment and interact with other users. Depending on the degree of immersion, users can begin playing a game, interact with other users, attend seminars, or complete course work for an online class. Online discussion groups and social networks such as Myspace and Facebook are already being used to supplement interaction within coursework (Baker 2009). Sparkle is poised to become the first virtual world for the iPhone. What's more, it's being developed completely from scratch, exclusively as an MMO for the iPhone/iPod Touch. This will bring more mobility to the learner. They will no longer need to be at a desktop. Second Life is a virtual world where users create avatars. An avatar is a virtual representation of the user to other users. These avatars then interact with any other user within the Second Life world. Avatars can purchase virtual land, own buildings, and travel, interact, conduct business, and even attend lectures by professors. Second Life is running 24 hours a day and is tied into the Internet, so there are always other avatars to interact with. MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft and Star Wars Galaxies are video game based virtual environments. These game engines hold the potential for instructional simulation. Unlike Second Life, these are pre-designed games with their own set of objectives that need to be completed through a progression. = Uses in education = In education, virtual learning environments are simulated experiences which utilize the pedagogical strategies of instructional modeling and role playing for the teaching of new concepts. The environment in which the experiences are presented is a virtual one often accessed via a computer or other video projection interface. Immersive virtual environment headsets have been used with younger children and students with special needs. The advantages of using instructional simulators via VLEs include: students are motivated when they are able to use computers and other technology; VLEs allow for interaction, exploration, and experimentation with locations, objects, and environments that would otherwise be unavailable in the absence of the VLE; instructors can adapt programs and parameters of the virtual learning experience to meet individual learner needs; when multi-user virtual environments are used collaborative and cooperative learning is encouraged; VLEs relate to students the real-world relevance of their learning by extending concepts and skills to application in the simulated environment; and learning can occur in an emotionally and physically safe environment without detrimental consequence. The use of instructional simulation with individuals with special needs is gaining more attention. Mitchell, Parsons, and Leonard (2007) created a \\"Virtual Café\\" program designed to teach social interaction skills to adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The program provides feedback to guide, or scaffold, the user toward making appropriate social behavior decisions. Virtual learning environments are also beginning to be used to teach children with ASD how to respond in potentially dangerous situations such as crossing the street and evacuating a building on fire (Strickland, McAllister, Coles, and Osborne 2007). The instructional simulation provides a safe environment within which to practice appropriate response skills. Distance learning is growing. The importance of a physical classroom is being reduced as the technology of distance learning develops (Sanders, 2006). Sanders (2006) present a warning that students may do well in distance learning environments, however they need to have engaging moments within the course. He also warns students to critically assess a new technology before adopting it as a learning tool. The virtual learning environment needs to simulate the learning process, using goals and objectives to measure the learners’ achievement. Sanders (2006) uses movies like Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Matrix, and I, Robot as callbacks to allegorical warnings of potential mishaps of relying too much on technology. He presents possible ways to balance a distance course so that it can effectively simulate a learning environment. Barney, Bishop, Adlong, and Bedgood (2009) studied the use of a 3D virtual laboratory as a tool to familiarize distance learning chemistry students with an actual chemistry laboratory. While it was not incorporated into the initial study, the researchers suggest including instructional scaffolding experiences to help alleviate students’ anxieties with applying mathematics and chemistry concepts in the actual laboratory setting (Barney, Bishop, Adlong, and Bedgood 2009). The virtual laboratory does not replace the real-world experience, rather it helps to enhance the student's schema of a chemistry laboratory and prepare them for performance expectations in the actual environment. Web-based virtual science laboratories are also used with elementary school students. In their study, Sun, Lin, and Yu (2008) found that students who used a web-based virtual science laboratory in conjunction with traditional teaching methods not only found the learning experience more enjoyable, they also performed better academically and received higher grades. Baker (2009) suggests multi- user virtual environments or MUVEs have the potential to engage students. Second Life holds more of a purpose in interaction (Baker, 2009). Instructors can hold lectures; students can collaborate through chat in Second Life. When compared to a discussion board, Second Life is a viable alternative for distance learning students to develop group work skills. At Chesapeake High School in Baltimore County, Maryland, students explore the ecological environment surrounding Mt. St. Helens via a 3D virtual learning environment (Curriculum Review 2009). Students navigate through the environment with a virtual unmanned vehicle and work collaboratively to solve ecological and environmental problems that are built into the program for instructional purposes. Engaging in the VLE provides many opportunities for application, data collection, and problem solving.  Uses in medicine  Sokolowski classifies medical simulations in 3 categories: 1. Simulators based on physical models, usually referred to as the Human Patient Simulator (HPS), of which several prototype exist for different purposes (CentraLine Man, Noelle and Pediasim mannequins); 2. Virtual Reality training simulators based on computers – i.e. LapVR Surgical Simulator, and Suture Tutor; 3. a hybrid model of the first two kinds combines a realistic 3D computerized representation of an organ system, for example, with the ability to interface with it through haptic devices. The use of simulation-based learning in the medical field has many benefits, including patient safety, accelerating diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, unfulfilled demand for medical personnel, medical cost reduction and lowering of medical errors that amount to loss of life and associated costs. The use of current technologies allow for very high fidelity simulations. These include Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs)- computer based 3D environments known as serious games, and other very highly immersive virtual environments, such as Cave Automatic Virtual environment(CAVE),in which the student sits in a projection room wearing goggles and gloves equipped with sensors. This haptic technology activates the sense of touch, allowing the trainee to interface with a simulated patient, as well as to receive visual and auditory feedbacks, making the simulated learning experience very realistic. According to research,Issenberg SB et al. 2005 \\"Features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to effective learning: A BEME systematic review.\\" Medical Teacher 2005; 27, (1):10-28 the best instructional simulators, medical or otherwise, contain these elements: * provide feedback * involve repetitive practice * integrate with the curricula * possess a range of difficulty levels * involve multiple learning strategies * capture clinical variations * occur in a control environment * utilize individualized learning * define expected outcomes * possess validity. Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs) in medical education range from teaching simple skills (taking a patient's blood) to complex skills (internal surgery). Different medical care providers use simulations for different purposes: emergency medical technicians, medics involved in combat environments, nurses, doctors, surgeons and medical First Responders in. IVEs simulate the human body so as to provide the student or trainee with the opportunity to realistically practice and thus become proficient as to the particular technique to be taught. IVEs are commonly used when teaching patient examination, surgical procedures and assessment (individual and collaborative). Students are relieved to know that these simulations are practice and appreciate the opportunity to make mistakes now rather than later. The use of IVEs provides a controlled, safe environment for students to learn and so the anxiety factor is reduced. Students can discuss the symptoms more openly than they could with an actual patient. At the same time, however, students use all the protocol they would with a real patient. That means they introduce themselves, address the patients by name and respect their privacy. The use of the simulation saves lives and money by reducing medical errors, training time, operating room time and the need to replace expensive equipment. Simulation users may practice on a variety of patients, each of which has a different case history, exhibits unique symptoms, and responds to user actions with appropriate physiological responses. As in real life, patient anatomy moves with the beating of the heart and the breathing of the lungs while tissues deform, bruise and bleed. The system generates a detailed evaluation after each session, enabling users and supervisors to measure the success of simulated procedures. = Barriers to instructional simulation in medicine = Simulations in medicine have been in use as early as the 16th century when the use of training mannequins helped to reduce the high maternal and infant mortality rates. Today they have evolved, to include IVEs, CAVE, robotic surgery, etc., but they are still relatively limited in their use by the health industry. Medicine is a profession that uses very advanced technical, high risk, as well as behavioral skills. However, unlike other areas with similar requirements (such as aviation), medicine has not totally embraced the use of simulations to assist with necessary medical training. The limited use of simulations for training in the medical field can be explained by several factors, including cost control, relatively limited modeling of the human body, lack of scientific evidence of effectiveness, and resistance to change by professional in the field. (Ziv, et al. 2003). A later study, conducted by Amalberti et al.(2005), points to 5 systemic structural barriers to the use of simulators to advance medical training. These are: # Unlimited decision-making autonomy of individual medical staff; instead, teamwork and regulations should anticipate problems and processes across departments. # Unlimited performance of individuals and of the system; instead, hours of work should be limited and shortage of staff addressed because excessive productivity-not competence, leads to medical errors. # Focus on status of individual; instead, standards of excellence of equivalent actors should be the goal. # Overprotection against personal liability; instead, more consideration should be given to \\"unintended consequences\\", and to system- level arbitration to optimize safety strategies. # Overregulation and technical complexities in medicine; instead, simplification of regulations is needed.Sokolowski, J., and Banks, C.(2009) Principles of Modeling and Simulation.

It is a wooden house that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. It is on a lot adjacent to the General John Hathorn Stone House, also listed on the Register. The house was originally built in 1767 by Abijah Morehouse, an early settler of the Warwick region who had arrived from Connecticut, and parts of it reflect English building traditions more common there. His descendants, particularly his son Jeremiah, extensively renovated it in the early 19th century, adding elements of that era's dominant Greek Revival style. House and property The house sits amid trees and shrubbery facing Hathorn Road, the former alignment of Route 94 and a largely unaltered section of the former Kings' Highway, 94's predecessor from the colonial era. It is on the northern of two parcels on the total property bisected by the road. There are several outbuildings, most of them considered contributing resources to the historic character of the property. It is five bays wide and two stories tall, on a fieldstone and mortar foundation. The gabled roof has a medium pitch. Siding is wood shake with some original corner boards remaining. The roof is shingled in asphalt, with two brick chimneys rising from the center. There is a small shed-roofed bump-out on the northern side. The windows are all flanked by pilasters and crowned with fully decorated entablatures. The interior is built on a center- hall plan and has a fully excavated basement. Most of the finishes and some of the wood trim dates to the mid-19th century. Some furnishings, such as the five-paneled wooden door that leads from the center to one of the older sections, date to the house's earliest years. There are a few other buildings and objects on the property that are of sufficient age to add to its historic character. A small wood frame shed with gabled metal-seam roof in the rear dates to the late 19th century. In front of the house are an iron hitching post and a millstone used as a carriage step; these too are contributing. A detached frame garage is of unknown date but is probably recent; it is the only non-contributing resource on the property. Across the road, the stone wall is included in the listing, as is the large wooden dairy barn with a collapsed roof. Next to it is a smaller, L-shaped building probably used as a chicken coop and granary. Another smaller barn with cupola in a late Victorian style was probably used for keeping horses. History Adonijah Morehouse came to the Warwick area from Ridgefield, Connecticut around 1764, drawn like many others from New England by reports of unsettled land and fertile fields. He bought the land in 1767 and married Sarah Brower the next year. The house as originally built was probably close to the English models seen in Connecticut at the time; however it was likely only one and a half stories in height rather than the two more typical of English vernacular homes. This is more typical of homes in the Hudson Valley, where homebuilding was as influenced by Dutch and German traditions as English. Census and property tax records for the remainder of the 18th century do not list Jeremiah or his mother as the owner. This is probably because they left the house at that time to go live with her second husband in the nearby hamlet of Bellvale. By 1800 he is listed as the head of the house, and so it remained through the 1830 census. In the 1840s the family expanded the house, adding to the west and giving it its current footprint. They also extensively remodeled the interior, and the trim from this era shows the influence of the then-popular Greek Revival. Most notable in this regard is the chinoiserie-inspired staircase. The structural framing was also revised to include some lighter, milled woods to supplement the heavy-hewn beams the house had originally been built with. Twenty years later George Morehouse expanded the house again. This time they raised it to two full stories and added a boxed cornice with hidden \\"Yankee\\" gutter. Both small rear porches were added at this time, suggesting the influence of the Picturesque as visualized by Andrew Jackson Downing. The house was sold in 1871 to local dairy farmer Pierson Ezra Sanford, who combined both it and the Hathorn property next door into one lot. The barn across the street, and many of the other outbuildings, were likely built around this time to support the farming operations. In the 20th century, the house and property passed to other owners. One of them removed the box cornice and replaced Yankee gutters with standard gutters; the seam-metal roof was also shingled. The current owner put the shakes over the original clapboard.

History Early attempts to estimate the longevity of dinosaurs used allometric scaling principles. Ages were determined by dividing individual mass estimates by rates of growth for similar, extant taxa. For very large individuals, growth rates were extrapolated to dinosaur proportions using regression analysis. The results of these investigations have been extremely variable as they depend on mass estimates and growth rates that are highly at odds with one another. For example, longevity estimates for the sauropod Hypselosaurus priscus range from a few decades to several hundred years.Case, T. J. (1978). Speculations on the growth rate and reproduction of some dinosaurs. Paleobiology 4, 320-328. However, it has been shown that most dinosaur bones have growth lines that are visible in thin sectioned material viewed under a polarized light source.Reid, R. E. H. (1990). Zonal \\"growth rings\\" in dinosaurs. Mod. Geol. 15, 19-48. Growth lines Two types of growth lines exist: annuli, and lines of arrested growth (LAGs).Francillion-Viellot H., et al., (1990). Microstructure and mineralization of vertebrate skeletal tissues. In Skeletal Biomineralization: Patterns, Processes, and Evolutionary Trends (J. G. Carter, Ed.). Vol. 1, pp. 471-530. Van Nostrand-Reinhold, New York. Histological examinations have revealed that annuli are composed of thin layers of avascular bone with parallel-aligned bone fibers. The growth line annuli are found compressed between broad vascularized regions of bone with randomly oriented fibrillar patterns, known as zones. Lines of arrested growth, similar to annuli, are found between zones are avascular. They are, however, much thinner, and have relatively fewer bone fibers by volume. Studies on extant vertebrates indicate that the vascularized zones form during moderate to rapid skeletogenesis, and that abrupt metabolic disruptions of bone formation can trigger growth line deposition. Both types of growth lines may be deposited in synchrony with endogenous biorhythms. For example, captive crocodilians exposed to constant temperature, diet, and photoperiod, still exhibit the periodic and cyclical skeletal growth banding of their wild counterparts.Castanet et al. (1993). Bone and individual aging. In Bone (B. K. Hall, Ed.), pp. 245-283. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fl. Consequently, it is assumed by many paleontologists that the growth lines of dinosaurs reflect annual rhythms, and that they may be used to determine individual ages. However, in the large and long bones of many dinosaurian taxa, resorption of internal and external bone proceeds even as new cortical bone continues to be deposited, so that growth lines deposited early in development may need to be inferred. Results in dinosaurs The results of pioneering efforts to age dinosaur fossils using growth ring counts suggest that the longevity of the basal ceratopsian Psittacosaurus mongoliensis was 10 or 11 years.Erickson, G. M. and Tumanova, T. A. (2000). Growth curve and life history attributes of Psittacosaurus mongoliensis (Ceratopsia: Psittacosauridae) inferred from long bone histology.

Beginnings  One of his first special FX roles was as make up artist for Joe D'Amato, whose film Emanuelle in America required detailed special FX for the notorious snuff film sequences. De Rossi prepared several gruesome effects for the film reels, which were played as part of the narrative; the effects included a woman's breasts being hacked off, multiple floggings, burning with acid and pokers and shootings. The FX were so convincing, many thought them real snuff film scenes, also an actress complained, she had been traumatised by the effects as well.  International fame  When gore master Lucio Fulci required FX, for the goriest horror film in history Zombi 2, De Rossi arrived on set, and in the process created zombies, bite wounds and an exploding head. This film cemented his reputation as possibly the greatest special FX designer of all time. De Rossi would continue to help Fulci in two more films: The Beyond and The House by the Cemetery.  Hollywood fame  De Rossi was next called by Dino De Laurentiis to work with Carlo Rambaldi to create the on-set practical effects for two films in Mexico including the sci fi blockbuster Dune, for which he worked wonders, creating the fetus-shaped Spice Guild Navigator seen floating in a tank. The other film (shot simultaneously and using many of the same sets) would be Conan the Destroyer in which he helped create the mutated Wizard as well as the Dagoth monster suit worn by André the Giant. In the late 80's he created the special makeup effects on Rambo III most specifically the shot in which Rambo heals himself by igniting gunpowder inside of a torso bullet wound (De Rossi rigged a device which caused flame to burst from both Sylvester Stallone's stomach and back at once). Stallone was so impressed by De Rossi's work that he made sure to hire him again for the make-up effects for Daylight (1996 film), which was shot in Rome and put Stallone's son Sage Stallone in contact with Lucio Fulci. Fabrizio De Angelis (who had previously produced all the Fulci films De Rossi had worked on) invited him in to work in the Dominican Republic to create the title monster in the film Killer Crocodile (1989 film) with the offer to direct two low budget sci-fi films (Killer Crocodile 2 and The Cy Warrior) of his own for his company Fulvia Film. He is also notable as the designer of the mask used in the film The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film).  Later years  De Rossi continued creating FX for both Italian and American cinema, of which he still does today.

Cochran went on to study neutron diffraction with Bertram Brockhouse and used lattice dynamics and to explain the phenomenon of ferroelectricity in terms of lattice instabilities. This was tested by his students Stuart Pawley, Roger Cowley and Richard Nelmes. This idea was also advanced around the same time by Philip Anderson, but Cochran credits Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman and Negundagi with the original idea. Cochran's basic idea is that on cooling from a high temperature state, symmetry breaking can occur. Cochran returned to Edinburgh in 1964 as Chair of Natural Philosophy. He became Head of Department in 1975 and was instrumental in the merger of the Natural Philosophy and Mathematical Physics departments. He was vice-principal from 1984 to 1987. Cochran also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1992. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in March 1962 and won their Hughes Medal in 1978. He won the Howard N. Potts Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1984. Cochran died from motor neurone disease in 2003.

It was later published validly by Zdeněk Pouzar in 1955. The type species is B. fuligineoalba. The genus is ectomycorrhizal with gymnosperms, usually with trees from the pine family. Fruitbodies of Bankera species are fleshy, usually with a centrally-placed stipe, and greyish-brown spines on the hymenial undersurface. The texture of the flesh ranges from soft to tough, but it lacks the zones associated with some other Bankeraceae genera. Dried flesh often has a fenugreek odor. Spores range in shape from more or less spherical to ellipsoid, and are hyaline (translucent), with thin walls. In deposit, they are white. Bankera has a monomitic hyphal system with brownish to hyaline, inflated generative hyphae. In 2013, based on molecular and morphological evidence, Richard Baird proposed that the type species Bankera fuligineoalba be transferred into the genus Phellodon, as Phellodon fuligineoalbus.

Contingent Value Right (CVR) facilitating the transaction where some uncertainty is inherent. CVRs may be separately tradeable securities; they are occasionally acquired (or shorted) by specialized hedge funds. Forms These rights typically take either of two forms:Thomson Reuters (2019). Contingent Value Rights (CVRs), Practical Law series (1) Event-driven CVRs compensate the owners for yet to eventuate positive developments in their business - hence protecting the acquirer against the valuation risk inherent in overpaying. (2) Price- protection CVRs are granted when payment is share based - protecting the acquired company, by providing a hedge against downside price risk in the acquirer's equity. In the first case, CVRs are granted Motley Fool (2018). What Is a Contingent Value Right? in scenarios in which the acquiring company does not wish to pay for a product that might not work, has a limited market, or might need significant investment; whereas on the other side, the acquired company “wants to get full value for its assets”. The CVR then “helps bridge this negotiation”. Under these rights, shareholders will receive additional cash, securities, or benefits if a specific and named event occurs \\\\- one where the value of the firm significantly increases \\\\- within a specified timeframe. CVRs are very common in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries; they are also often granted to shareholders in companies facing significant, value accretive restructuring. For an example see Media General / Nexstar Media Group. The second case, protection against price risk, is facilitated by specifying that payment will be made at an averaged, as opposed to final, share price; a floor may also be set. SEC (2006). Questions and Answers For Contingent Value Rights Holders Valuation Under both, the CVR is in function, a form of option. Jan W Dash (2004). Quantitative Finance and Risk Management: A Physicist's Approach, World Scientific. The first case: analogous to a call option, the payout to the CVR holder will be triggered by the event occurring, and will be zero otherwise. To determine the value of these rights, analysts will apply a modified option pricing model based on the probability of the event, the time horizon specified, and the corresponding payout rules; see contingent claim valuation.

Etymology Gustav Oppert in the 19th century reasoned that skōlex referred to a like-sounding word in the Indian language, and was convinced the word was culukī () for \\"fish\\" or \\"porpoise\\". In his opinion, the word could refer even to a \\"crocodile\\" by extension. Scholar Erik Seldeslachts, in a 1998 paper, has suggested parallel with kṛmiḥ () which has the dual meaning of \\"worm\\" and a name of a nāgarāja or \\"serpent king\\". Description Ctesias's Indica described the worm or skōlex () as the only creature to inhabit the Indus. It resembled the worm which infested figs, but averaged 7 cubits (10 ft) in length. It had a pair of large teeth, one on the upper jaw and one on the lower. The teeth were square, measuring 1 pygōn in the Ancient Greek scale of length, about 15 inches long. It burrowed in the mud bottom by day, and nocturnally devoured prey such as horses, cows, donkeys or camels. Philostratus, reporting on the creature of the same river system, said it resembled a white worm, alluding to its color. The worm was reputedly hunted with bait, and a volatile inflammable oil was collected from it. This oil was used in warfare by Indian kings; cities were set ablaze with he oil- filled sealed pots, thrown like grenades. This \\"skolex oil\\" may have actually been petroleum or naphtha, and not derived from an animal at all. Although, assuming the skolex referred to some crocodilian, oil could be extracted from this reptile. It is known that fish oils or the Ganges dolphin oil have been exploited in India, although not for incendiary purpose. The worm may have given rise to the legend of the horned creature odontotyrannus of the Ganges, reported to have attacked Alexander the Great's troops.

On the Poverty of Student Life: A Consideration of Its Economic, Political, Sexual, Psychological and Notably Intellectual Aspects and of a Few Ways to Cure it () is a pamphlet first published by students of the University of Strasbourg and the Situationist International (SI) in 1966. Attacking the subservience of university students and the strategies of student radicals, it caused significant uproar, led to the dissemination of Situationist ideas, and precipitated the events of May 1968 in France.  Background and publication  Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five \\"Pro-situs\\", Situationist-influenced students had been elected to the University of Strasbourg's students' union in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities. Their first action was to form an \\"anarchist appreciation society\\" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for Karl Marx and Ravachol; next they appropriated union funds to flypost \\"Return of the Durruti Column\\", André Bertrand's détourned comic strip. They then invited the Situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and On the Poverty of Student Life, written by Tunisian Situationist Mustapha/Omar Khayati was the result. The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the academic year. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media. The students responsible were expelled and the student union closed under court order. The scandal significantly raised the profile of the SI and led them to reappraise the revolutionary potential of academia, reversing their previous disillusionment to take seats on the Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne during May 1968. On the Poverty of Student Life was a key text for the French and German students who rebelled in 1968.  Content and reception  The text displayed an advanced understanding of Situationist concepts and tactics. It provoked the students of the university by confronting them with their subservience to the ideological conditions imposed upon them by the state, family and the university system. The pamphlet alleged that the students fled from this reality to take refuge in miserabilism and bohemianism. It also criticised radical student collectives including the Provos (Netherlands), Committee of One Hundred (United Kingdom) and those of Berkeley, California (United States) for fighting specific issues such as nuclear arms, racism and censorship rather than the system at large, praising only Spies for Peace. The title of the pamphlet induced fury in the Parisian cafés in the Spring of 1967. The pamphlet was described by a local newspaper shortly after its release as \\"the first concrete manifestation of a revolt aiming quite openly at the destruction of society\\". Critic Greil Marcus characterised the pamphlet as a polemic in his history of 20th century avant-garde art movements Lipstick Traces (1990).

Bodianus axillaris, female Description The axilspot hogfish is sexually dimorphic with the adult males being coloured reddish-brown on the front part of their bodies contrasting with the white posterior end and having a sizeable black spot at the base of the pectoral fin, as well as on the dorsal and anal fins. The females and the juveniles are a blackish colour marked with white blotches along the upper and lower flanks. The juveniles of this species resemble those of the split-level hogfish (Bodianus mesothorax) but possess white instead of yellow spots. It grows to a standard length of . Distribution Axilspot hogfish are found in the Indo-Pacific, from the Red Sea to South Africa, Marshall Islands, Marquesan, and Tuamoto Islands, north to Japan. Habitat and biology The adults of the axilspot hogfish are found in clear lagoon and along seaward reefs where they are common in clear shallow waters at depths of between . The larger fish are occasionally found in deeper water below . The juveniles are found singly in caves or under overhangs where they behave as cleaner fish, adults will sometimes behave in this way too. Their diet is made up of benthic, hard-shelled, invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans. It is oviparous and the males and females form distinct pairs when spawning. Human use It is infrequently encountered in the aquarium trade, and is not a species of interest to commercial fisheries.

Species have small- to medium-sized fruitbodies with white spines on the underside from which spores are released. All Phellodon have a short stalk or stipe, and so the genus falls into the group known as \\"stipitate hydnoid fungi\\". The tough and leathery flesh usually has a pleasant, fragrant odor, and develops a cork- like texture when dry. Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together, sometimes producing large mats of joined caps. Phellodon species produce a white spore print, while the individual spores are roughly spherical to ellipsoid in shape, with spiny surfaces. The genus, with about 20 described species, has a distribution that includes to Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. About half of the species are found in the southeastern United States, including three species added to the genus in 2013–14. Several Phellodon species were placed on a preliminary Red List of threatened British fungi because of a general decline of the genus in Europe. Species grow in a symbiotic mycorrhizal association with trees from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae (pines). Accurate DNA-based methods have been developed to determine the presence of Phellodon species in the soil, even in the extended absence of visible fruitbodies. Although Phellodon fruitbodies are considered inedible due to their fibrous flesh, the type species, P. niger, is used in mushroom dyeing. Taxonomy Phellodon was circumscribed in 1881 by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten to contain white- toothed fungi. Karsten included three species: P. cyathiformis, P. melaleucus, and the type, P. niger (originally published with the epithet nigrum). P. nigrum was originally described by Elias Fries in 1815 as a species of Hydnum. Some early authors did not consider Phellodon distinct enough to be a separate genus, and folded species assigned to this genus into Hydnellum. Hydnellum is classified in the family Bankeraceae, which was circumscribed by Marinus Anton Donk in 1961. Donk's original family concept included the genera Bankera and Phellodon, whose species produce hyaline (translucent) and echinulate spores (covered with small spines). Donk also noted that Bankeraceae species lacked clamp connections. When clamp connections were discovered in Phellodon fibulatus and tuberculate spore ornamentation (the presence of small nodules on the spores) was found in P. niger, Kenneth Harrison thought the family Bankeraceae was superfluous, and placed Phellodon and Bankera in the family Hydnaceae. This taxonomic rearrangement was rejected by Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus in 1974, who showed that the tuberculate spores of P. niger were the result of an immature specimen. Richard Baird and Saeed Khan investigated spore ornamentation in North American Phellodon species using scanning electron microscopy, and rejected the placement of Phellodon in the Bankeraceae, preferring to leave it and Bankera in the Hydnaceae. Modern molecular phylogenetic analysis places Phellodon in the thelephoroid clade (roughly equivalent to the order Thelephorales) along with the related genera Bankera, Hydnellum, and Sarcodon. Although the status of the Bankeraceae has not been fully clarified with molecular genetic techniques, Phellodon is classified in this family by authorities on fungal taxonomy. The generic name is derived from phell-, meaning \\"cork\\", and -don, meaning \\"tooth\\". In North America, Phellodon species are commonly known as \\"cork hydnums\\". The British Mycological Society, in their recommended list of common names for fungi in the United Kingdom, name Phellodon species in the form \\"descriptor word\\" plus \\"tooth\\": fused tooth (P. confluens), grey tooth (P. melaleucus), black tooth (P. niger), and woolly tooth (P. tomentosus). Description P. tomentosus pictured) can fuse together during growth. The fruit bodies of Phellodon species have caps and stipe, and thus fall into the general category \\"stipitate hydnoid fungi\\". The cap surfaces are initially velvety to tomentose, eventually becoming matted. The surface is rough, with pits and ridges, and sometimes with concentrical zones of color or texture. The color can vary considerably, from cream to yellowish, brownish, greenish, greyish or black. Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together, forming intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. Alexander H. Smith wrote of P. tomentosus, \\"It often occurs in large mats of fused caps almost producing a ceiling over large areas of the moss under conifers.\\" Phellodon fruitbodies can envelop nearby grass or twigs. The stipe is thickly tomentose or smooth, typically the same color as the cap or darker. In P. niger, the outer covering of the stipe is a thick felty layer of mycelium that absorbs water like a sponge. The hymenophore (the fertile, spore-bearing surface) is on the underside of the cap. The spines become grey at maturity. In conditions of high humidity, P. niger can form striking drops of black liquid on the actively growing caps. Spines of Phellodon tomentosus The fibrous flesh is single to double-layered; duplex layering results from differences in compactness or in the alignment of the constituent hyphae. Tough and leathery when fresh, the flesh develops a corklike texture when dry. In the dried state it often has an odor of fenugreek or curry powder. Phellodon species are often free of insect damage, suggesting that they may have defensive chemicals that deter predation. Fruitbodies are not considered edible due to their fibrous flesh. The hyphal system is monomitic, containing only generative hyphae. These hyphae are not less than 6 μm in diameter. All European species lack clamp connections, but they are present in the North American species P. fibulatus and P. mississippiensis. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. Cystidia are either absent, or present infrequently as incompletely differentiated cystidioles (sterile cells about the size of an immature basidium). In mass, the spores are white. Spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, and echinulose (covered with small spines). They are also hyaline and inamyloid. Habitat and distribution Fruit bodies grow on the ground. Phellodon species, like all members of the order Thelephorales, are thought to be mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with trees. Usual hosts include species from the families Fagaceae (beeches and oaks) and Pinaceae. The ectomycorrhizae that P. niger forms with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has been comprehensively described. It is distinguished from the ectomycorrhizae of other Thelephorales species by the unique shape of its chlamydospores. Stable isotope ratio analysis of the abundance of the stable isotope carbon-13 shows that P. niger has a metabolic signature close to that of saprotrophic fungi, indicating that it may be able to obtain carbon from sources other than a tree host. Many Phellodon species are known from the southeastern United States, where they have been extensively researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine distinct Phellodon species from Great Smoky Mountains and the surrounding southern Appalachian Mountains. Three additional species from this area, P. mississippiensis, P. brunneo-olivaceus, and P. fuligineoalbus were added to the genus in 2013–14. Conservation Phellodon melaleucus Phellodon species, like other members of the family Bankeraceae, are sensitive to air pollution and soil pollution, and are in general decline in western Europe. In a preliminary assessment for a red list of threatened British Fungi, P. confluens, P. tomentosus, and P. melaleucus are considered vulnerable, and P. niger is rare. Conservation efforts for stipitate hydnoid fungi are hampered by a dearth of information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below- ground mycelium, making it hard to determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P. niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers that can be used to detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P. melaleucus and P. niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can be used to determine the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction. Chemistry Phellodon species contain thelephoric acid, a metabolite of the shikimic acid pathway. Thelephoric acid is a terphenyl quinone—a 1,4-benzoquinone wherein positions carbon-2 and carbon-5 are substituted with phenyl groups. The hirsutane derivative phellodonic acid is found in P. melaleucus. Phellodonic acid, which exhibits antibiotic activity towards bacteria and other fungi, was the first bioactive compound reported from any member of the order Thelephorales. A total synthesis was described for phellodonic acid in 2008 using cis-1,2-dihydrocatechol as the starting material. The compound atromentin was reported to occur in fruitbodies of P. melaleucus, but this was not confirmed in a later analysis. P. niger has been a source for several bioactive compounds: the cyathane-type diterpenoids, nigernin A and B; a nitrogenous terphenyl derivative, phellodonin; 2',3'-diacetoxy-3,4,5',6',4-pentahydroxy-p- terphenyl; grifolin; and 4-O-methylgrifolic acid. P. niger has also been used for mushroom dyeing, in which it produces gray-blue and green colors. Species Phellodon atratus Phellodon sinclairii Phellodon was originally circumscribed with three species. Joost Stalpers included 13 Phellodon species in his 1993 monograph on the Thelephorales. The tenth edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi (2008) indicated 16 species in the genus. , Index Fungorum lists 18 species of Phellodon, not including the three eastern United States species added in 2013–14. *Phellodon atratus K.A.Harrison (1964) – California, United States *Phellodon brunneo-olivaceus R.E.Baird (2013) – United States *Phellodon confluens (Pers.)

Design and development Based on the pre-World War II Cadet and using the wartime experience with radio-controlled aircraft the company designed a two-seat cabin monoplane. The Model V had a low-set cantilever wing with the outer panels having a pronounced dihedral. It had a tricycle retractable landing gear and an enclosed cabin with side by side seating for two. It was unique in that it had a system called Simpli-Fly Control where the aircraft was automatically trimmed for takeoff, landing and cruise, by turning a small metal wheel between the two seats and lining up two arrows with the mode of flying the aircraft. Interconnecting controls then adjusted the trim according to the arrow settings.\\"Culver Model V\\", August 1946, Popular Science bottom page 30 Simpli-Fly was not popular with pilots. Only a limited production run of 350 Model Vs was achieved before the company went bankrupt. In 1956 the Superior Aircraft Company bought the assets of Culver and put the Model V back into production as the Superior Satellite. The main difference was the use of a 95 hp Continental engine which increased the cruise speed to 130 mph (209 km/h). Only a prototype and five production aircraft were built.

He began his political career in the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) when the East German branches of SPD and the Communist Party of Germany merged after the Second World War. Mückenberger was one of the most high-ranking former Social Democrats in the German Democratic Republic and held several positions in the SED. Early life and political activism Mückenberger spent his childhood in Chemnitz. He later worked there as a machine-fitter apprentice. In 1924 he joined the Social Democratic youth organization. In 1927 he became a SPD member. Mückenberger became an activist of its paramilitary wing, Reichsbanner. After the National Socialist takeover, he engaged in underground resistance against the new regime. In 1935 he was arrested and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He was released after several months. In 1938 he was again arrested and was put in jail for ten months. In 1942 he was drafted to the German military and sent to the frontline. http://www.aggi- info.de/fileadmin/Artikel/info%2020/Rez%204%20Schunke.pdf Political career in the GDR After returning home in 1945, Mückenberger again became active in the SPD. Through the merger of SPD and KPD in the Soviet Occupation Zone, Mückenberger became a SED member. He became First Secretary of the SED Party District Organization in Saxony in 1948. Mückenberger then served as First Secretary of the Thuringia Party District Organization of SED 1949–1952. As the Thuringia District was divided along the geographic reorganization of the German Democratic Republic, Mückenberger became First Secretary of the Erfurt Party District Organization (one of the districts created out of the Thuringia organization). He remained as the First Secretary of the Erfurt SED District until 1953. Mückenberger became a candidate member of the politburo of SED in 1950.

Mückenberger became First Secretary of the Frankfurt/Oder Party District Organization of SED in 1961. He stepped down in 1971 and was replaced by the then Second Secretary Hans-Joachim Hertwig. In the same year, he was appointed as the Chairman of the influential SED Central Control Commission, the party organ regulating party memberships. In 1978, he was elected chairman of the German-Soviet Friendship Society. In 1980, he was elected as the head of the SED parliamentary group in the Volkskammer (the national parliament of the GDR). Mückenberger remained in the SED politburo until November 1989. Later life Mückenberger was expelled from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany/Party of Democratic Socialism on November 21, 1990. Following the German reunification, Mückenberger was put on trial for shootings at the Berlin Wall, a process that Mückenberger himself dubbed as 'victors' justice'.

The term \\"man cave\\" is a metaphor describing a room where one or more male family members and optionally their friends are supposed to be able to do as they please, without fear of upsetting any female household members with their interior design choices. Paula Aymer of Tufts University calls it the \\"last bastion of masculinity\\". The first known use of the phrase is from March 21, 1992, in the Toronto Star by Joanne Lovering: \\"With his cave of solitude secured against wife intrusion by cold floors, musty smells and a few strategic cobwebs, he will stay down there for hours nestled in very manly magazines and open boxes of tools. Let's call the basement, man cave.\\" The phrase gained traction with the 1993 publication of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus by John Gray. While a man’s wife may have substantial authority over the rest of the house in terms of design and decoration, she often has no say in the look of a man's personal space. Because, stereotypically, the wife decides the decor of the home due to the role of caring for the family and managing household affairs. A man cave is a space where a man can express his creativity and sense of design. Purpose Man caves have multiple purposes: they are a place to be alone, to indulge in hobbies, and to hang out with male friends. It is, loosely, a male-only space to retreat to watch sports matches, play video games, or hang out with friends. According to psychiatrist and author Scott Haltzman, it is important for a man to have a place to call his own, referring to a male area to which to retreat. Rules are relaxed; it is a place where other people's sensibilities about standards of cleanliness are not necessarily observed. In a sense, for married men, it is a way to recreate some of the space and freedom of their pad, frat house, or college dorm room, where people could come and go as if they owned the place. It is where a man doesn't have to be on his best behavior, where no women are around, and is supposed to be able to relax. Writer and handyman Sam Martin explained: Martin thinks that any space in the house will do, even a lounge chair and a set of headphones, provided there's an agreement with one's wife or girlfriend that the space is under the control of the man. The advantages of a self-contained room are that male-oriented design choices, such as tacky lamps and beer-can sculptures, are out of sight of women, but in a way that doesn't disturb female sensibilities since visitors generally don't visit the man cave. It's like a firehouse lounge room, but in the home. Sociologist Tristan Bridges has interviewed American men and their partners about their man caves. He found that many men rarely used their man caves. One man Bridges interviewed said \\"I feel like some day guys from my neighbourhood will congregate here after work and we'll share a beer and chat.\\" When Bridges asked about who these guys were, the man replied \\"I don't know\\". Bridges says that his research has turned partly into 'a story about men's loneliness. Design According to several sources, the general architectural and design trend is for men to take traditionally male-only spaces, and enhance them with improvements and masculine aesthetic choices. Man caves can be equipped with accessories such as refrigerators, vending machines, putting greens, kegerators, giant TVs, musical instruments including gear such as microphone stands and amplifiers, pool tables, boxing rings, and entertainment centers. A man cave may also be fitted out with a bar and sports memorabilia such as trophies. In the book Where Men Hide which Publishers Weekly described as an affable but only “sometimes thought provoking” guide, author James Twitchell and photographer Ken Ross explore areas where men like to be alone.Publishers Weekly, 2006, James B. Twitchell, Author, Ken Ross, Photographer, Where Men Hide, Accessed July 10, 2013 According to Twitchell, some public male-only spaces, such as the barbershop, are declining, while other spaces are taking their places, and the author tries to show the attractions of the \\"grimy garage.\\" The book suggests that \\"men make their own spaces for good or ill\\", according to Publishers Weekly. Twitchell focused on communal man cave spaces such as male- only groups in megachurches, possibly a modern-day replacement for declining attendance at male-only clubs such as Masonic lodges. Twitchell noted that some anthropologists have speculated that these spots are a place for men to bond before hunting or war, and where they can \\"smoke or fart\\" and tell the \\"same jokes over and over again.\\"The Calgary Herald, May 19, 2006, Where men hide: Be it a man cave, a hidey-hole or a recliner, guys crave a place to be alone: Whether it is in the garage, the study or even just sitting in a La-Z- Boy recliner playing video games, men feel the need to get away from women occasionally, according to a new book chronicling the gender's favorite hiding spots, Accessed July 10, 2013 One man redecorated the space to look like a replica model of the bridge of the Starship Enterprise from the TV show Star Trek, while another man spent over 2 years and $120,000 to make his man cave into a Batcave. Upscale sports-themed furnishings are also available to outfit a man cave. These rooms are also often decorated by the male, with little or no female influence. The room may be large enough to accommodate a big screen television, often used for watching sports games with male friends. If it is an area set off from the rest of the house, it may be possible to make noise, or yell at the television, without fear of reprisals from a wife, girlfriend or mother. Garages have typically been a man space since they're often lit by \\"harsh fluorescent bulbs\\" and lack heat or air conditioning but nevertheless present a guy with an \\"opportunity to disappear for hours while never leaving the premises.\\" There are some reports suggesting that some men are likely to \\"lavish time, money and attention on fixing this spot up\\". Places in houses which have been typically associated with male-oriented chores, such as garages, basements and sheds which have not been \\"particularly welcoming spaces\\" when shared with storage items and garbage, are being fixed up to be more suitable as full-time living spaces, with more thought to design and planning. One man cave of a Gillette corporation executive has a desk, \\"a chess board that's always set up, never used\\". But sometimes there are limits; his wife has not yet agreed to let him smoke cigars in it.  Counterparts  Women have created similar spaces in which they can relax and pursue hobbies. These have been referred to as \\"she-sheds\\" and \\"girl-caves\\". Some analysts have described the manosphere as an online counterpart to the man- cave.DeKeseredy, Walter S., Alexis Fabricius, and Amanda Hall-Sanchez. \\"Fueling aggrieved entitlement: The contribution of women against feminism postings.\\" Crimsoc report 4 (2015): 1-34.

Alongside his brother José de Palafox, the Duke of Saragossa, Lazán was a national hero in 19th century Spain for his defence of Saragossa from the French Imperial armies in 1808 and 1809. Lazán was born to Juan Felipe Rebolledo de Palafox and doña Paula Melci de Eril and educated at the Escuelas Pías in Zaragoza. In 1809 he commanded an army in the campaign for Catalonia, winning a notable success at Castellón. Upon the restoration of Ferdinand VII to the Spanish Crown in 1814 (Treaty of Valençay), Lazán aligned himself with the reactionary party defending Ferdinand's absolute monarchy and opposing the liberal Constitution of 1812. From 1815 to 1820 Lazán served as Captain General of Aragon.

From 1743 he worked as a crown mast selector, then from 1756 he was the owner of the Hermeling estate (Hermeliņa muiža) and sawmill and several other estates in Riga. In 1765 he established the first paper factory in Riga. Steinhauer was involved for a long time in court proceedings with the Riga City Council in his attempts to win the right for representatives of all ethnic groups to trade in Riga, and managed to gain the right to supply ships in the port of Riga with timber. His son was officially accepted into the building owners’ guild in 1784.\\" Family Jānis Akmeņkalis was the son of Matīss Akmeņkalis (Germanised as Matthis Steinhauer), a runaway Latvian serf turned into a merchant who transported cargo for the Swedes during the Swedish rule of Riga. He was born about 1680 and emigrated to Riga from Courland at the turn of the century.

Economic success Hermelingshof in 1779.Drawing by Johann Christoph BrotzeJohann Steinhauer became Mast Inspector like his father and accomplished a considerable fortune in a short time. He traded timber and he was known for the quality of his products. He founded a sawmill in Hermelingshof (Hermalina) and the first paper factory in Riga. He owned estates, manors, and land in Riga and the rest of Latvia becoming the wealthiest man in Riga in the 17th century. Manors and estates that belonged to Johann Steinhauer and his family: * Sassenhof or Zasumuiža: In Sassenhof he built the First Paper's manufacturing industry. It operated both by wind and water. The mills produced various grades of paper, and raw materials for the Clothing and Printing Industries. * Hermelingshof: At this manor Steinhauer build a sawmill driven by a windmill that supplied the ships arriving at the port of Riga. * Möllershof or Mühlenhof by Riga (Zemunda) * Wohlershof or Voleri at Dünamünde (Daugavgrīva) * The meadows and grasslands of Spilwen (Spilve, Riga) * The windmills at Fosa Island * Aahaken or Bergshof located in the vicinity of Riga.

Drawing by Johann Christoph Brotze Fascinated by the Brethren's democratic ideals, Matthis Steinhauer became one of its earliest members of the pietist Moravian Church. He became the leader of the Moravian Society in Riga and his home, their meeting place. After his father's death Johann took his place in Riga's Moravian Society, and when the Herrnhuters were outlawed he continued to support the church and its missionary effort in secret. One of his Manors, Sassenhof, became the center for the underground Moravian Church in Riga. In 1754 he bought in Wachovia (Winston-Salem), North Carolina in support of the Moravian Church efforts to create a Moravian Colony there. This land was later sold to the Moravian Church and colonists who emigrated there.Martha Helen Haywood, Hubert Haywood, Mary Hilliard Hinton, E. E.

Johann Steinhauer, Riga, Russia \\" Throughout his live he promoted religious understanding and freedom in Riga. Johann Steinhauer versus the Great Guild and the Magistrature of Riga \\"The case of Steinhauer versus the Great Guild and the Magistrature of Riga was a significant event in the history of race relations in Riga\\".Bartlett, Roger P. (1979, p.89). The case of Steinhauer Versus The Great Guild and The Magistrature of Riga was a significant event in the history of race relations in Riga. With time the Steinhauers were able to amass a considerable fortune and own property throughout Riga. However all transactions had to be owned under somebody else's name, because, according to the Statute, only members of the Great Guild had the right to trade and to own property, and membership was refused to them because they were Latvian and of serf origin. In 1747 the Steinhauers brought the case before Riga's Senate but in 1753 it issued its verdict against the appellants. After the Senate's Decision, new restrictions against the Latvians were enacted. The Steinhauers brought their case before the Governor General of Livonia, prince Dolgoruky, who supported them, and eventually the Grand Duke Peter, heir to the Russian Throne, named Johann's brother Daniel commissar of commerce to Schleswig-Holstein, saving their property from confiscation. In 1757 Tobias Georg Efflein (Oeffelein), a German accountant and Daniel's son in law, applied for membership at the Great Guild and was refused on the grounds that he had given no proofs of his standing as a bookkeeper, and that his wife was a Latvian. In 1757 the Senate's previous ruling was dismissed, under the auspices of Katherina the Great, and ordered the Guild to accept his membership. The senate ruling had far reaching consequences for it established the right of any worthy inhabitant of Riga, regardless of national origin, to trade and own property in Riga.Bartlett, Roger P. (1979, p.89). Legacy Johann Steinhauer's entrepreneurial successes, his efforts to bring about the right of ownership and freedom of worship on behalf of the native Latvians and serfs had far reaching consequences. At the time of his birth native Latvians and serfs were a stagnant social caste with little opportunity for social movement, the ruling of Riga's Senate opened new opportunities for future generations of inhabitants of Riga. Partly because of his support of the Moravian Church, it eventually became an accepted and popular religious movement among Latvians, having at one point 50,000 converts in three years. Among his many descendants are: Rev. Johann Steinhauer III, Moravian Minister and Teacher, Principal of the Fulneck Moravian School in England, who established the Boarding School for young ladies at Gracehill in Ireland and who married the daughter of John Gambold, the first Moravian Bishop of the British Isles; Henry Steinhauer, the first Paleobotanist in the Americas and Principal of the Moravian Ladies Seminary of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Botanist and early Ohio plant collector Daniel Steinhauer; Barbara Steinhauer married to Sarepta's (now Volgograd, Russia) Doctor in Medicine Joachim Wier and Johanna Magdalena Riegelmann married to the jurist and administrator of the Hennersdorf Castle in Saxonia; Karl Eduard von Napiersky Dr. Philosophie, researcher, author and publisher of Latvian historical and biographical books: Index corporis historico- diplomatici Livoniae, Esthoniae, Curoniae, Monumenta Livoniae antiquae volumes 1 and 2, Beiträge zur Geschichte der Kirchen und Prediger in Livland. 4 Volumes, among others.

Microscopically, the lesions described closely resembled the tumor, \\"nerve sheath myxoma\\", an entity first described by Harkin and Reed. The latter had, through the years, been variously described as \\"Bizarre cutaneous neurofibroma\\", \\"Myxoma of nerve sheath\\", and \\"Pacinian neurofibroma\\". Clinically, neurothekeomas present as a solitary nodule of the skin. The most common sites of occurrence are the head and neck and the extremities. The lesions range in size from about 0.5 cm. to more than 3 cm. The average patient age is about 25 years, but neurothkeomas may occur at any age. Women are affected about more often; the male to female ratio is approximately 1:2. Microscopically, neurothekeoma consists of closely aggregated bundles or fascicles of spindle-shaped cells. The fascicles may or may not have a myxoid background. Since the time of their first description, it has been reported that neurothekeomas are likely not of nerve sheath origin, as implied by the term. Consequently, neurothekeoma and nerve sheath myxoma are likely not related histogenetically, although they are similar in appearance and in behavior.

Under these unsettled circumstances, it was difficult for any authority to carry on a campaign of oppression against the Sikhs; instead the Sikhs were often sought and valued as useful allies in the various struggles for power.Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739–1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739–1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, pp. 68–69, 115–23, 139–43. In these times of relative calm, however, Shah Nawaz, the governor at Lahore in 1747 and his Afghan allies resumed their genocidal campaigns against the Sikhs. This period was characterised by the desecration of Sikh places of worship and the organised capture, torture and merciless execution of tens of thousands of Sikh men, women and children.Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739–1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739–1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, pp. 79–83. = The Governorship of Mir Mannu = Mir Mannu (Mu'in ul-Mulk) became governor of Lahore and the surrounding provinces in 1748 through his exploits in battle against the Afghan army. His first act as governor was to take control of Ram Rauni, the Sikh fort at Amritsar, where 500 Sikhs had taken shelter. Mir Mannu then stationed detachments of troops in all parts of Punjab with any Sikh inhabitants with orders to capture them and shave their heads and beards. His oppression was such that large numbers of Sikhs moved to relatively inaccessible mountains and forests. The governor ordered the apprehending of Sikhs and to send them in irons to Lahore. Hundreds were thus taken to Lahore and executed in the horse market before crowds of onlookers.Bhagat Singh, \\"Mu'in ul-Mulk\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume III, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1997, p. 130. According to the historian Nur Ahmed Chishti Mir Mannu ordered 1100 Sikhs to be killed at the horse market during Eid. Partly through the influence of his Hindu minister, Kaura Mall, who was sympathetic to the Sikhs, and partly because of the threat of another Afghan invasion, Mir Mannu made peace with the Sikhs the next year. This truce was to last until the passing of Kaura Mall in the battle against the Afghans in 1752 and the surrender of Lahore to invader Ahmad Shah Durrani. In his new role as governor for the Afghans, Mir Mannu was able to resume his persecution of the Sikhs. Moreover, he had arranged for new artillery to be forged and a unit of 900 men assigned especially to the hunting down of the \\"infidels\\".Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739–1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739–1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, pp. 63–64, 66. In the words of an eyewitness: \\"Muin appointed most of the gunmen to the task of chastising the Sikhs. They ran after these people up to a day and slew them wherever they stood up to oppose them. Anybody who brought a Sikh head received a reward of ten rupees per head.\\"Syed Hasan Askari, \\"Tahmasnamah\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume IV, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1998, p. 300. According to that same account: \\"The Sikhs who were captured alive were sent to hell by being beaten with wooden mallets. At times, Adina Beg Khan sent 40 to 50 Sikh captives from the Doab. They were as a rule killed with the strokes of wooden hammers.\\" Mir Mannu explicitly ordered his troops to seize and torture the Sikh women and children. The women were seized from their homes and forced grind grain in prison with the detainees forced to grind about 1.25 maunds of grain (46 kilo grams) of grain to grind in a day. According to a Sikh account, \\"Many of the women were given merciless lashing, working all day exhausted from thirst and hunger, they plied their stone-mills and while they plied their stone-mills and sang their Guru's hymns. The Hindu or the Muslim, or in fact anyone who saw them and listened to their songs was utterly astonished. As their children, hungry and thirsty, wailed and writhed on the ground for a morsel, the helpless prisoners in the hands of the prisoners could do little except solace them with their affection until wearied from crying the hungry children would go to sleep.\\"Harbans Singh, The Heritage of the Sikhs, Delhi, Manohar Books, 1983, pp. 135–36 Mir Mannu's reign, however, did not stop the spread of Sikhism.Bhagat Singh, \\"Mu'in ul-Mulk\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume III, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1997, p. 131. = Baba Deep Singh = In 1757, when Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded India for loot and plunder a fourth time he was so harassed by Sikh fighters who several times slew his guards and pillaged his baggage train that he became determined to take his revenge on them. Because Durrani could not lay his hands on the elusive bands of Sikhs, he determined to attack their holy city Amritsar, the Harimandir Sahib was blown up, and the surrounding pool filled with the entrails of slaughtered cows.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469–1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, pp. 144–45. Baba Deep Singh a prominent Sikh Sant Hearing of this event Baba Deep Singh, an elderly scholar of the Sikhs living at Damdama Sahib, south of Amritsar, was stirred to action. As leader of one of the Sikh divisions entrusted with the care of the temple he felt responsible for the damage that had been done to it and announced his intention of rebuilding the Harmandir Sahib. He set out his forces Sikhs toward the Amritsar and along the way, many other Sikhs joined, eventually numbering about 5,000 when they reached the outskirts of Amritsar. In the nearby town of Tarn Taran Sahib they prepared themselves for martyrdom by sprinkling saffron on each other's turbans.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469–1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 145; Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739–1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739–1768), Shimla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, p. 109. When word reached Lahore that a large body of Sikhs had arrived near Amritsar a general mobilisation was ordered. Two large forces were sent. Approaching Amritsar, Baba Deep Singh and his companions encountered them and a fierce battle ensued.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469–1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 145; Hari Ram Gupta, A History of the Sikhs from Nadir Shah's Invasion to the Rise of Ranjit Singh (1739–1799); Volume I: Evolution of the Sikh Confederacies (1739–1768), Simla, Minerva Book Shop, 1952, pp. 109–110. Wielding his double-edged sword, the 69-year-old Sikh sustained many wounds. According to tradition, his head was severed but Baba Deep Singh still pressed on in his determination to reach the holy shrine, until he made the precincts of the Harmandir Sahib. It was Baba Deep Singh's headless body holding his head on his left hand and wielding his great sword in his right that had fought on until he redeemed his pledge to reach the holy temple.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469–1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 145; K.S. Thapar, \\"Baba Dip Singh\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume I, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1995, p. 588.  The Massacre of 1762 When Ahmad Shah Durrani returned for his sixth campaign of conquest (his fifth being in 1759–1761), Sikh fighters were residing in the town of Jandiala, east of Amritsar. The place was the home of Aqil, the head of the Nirinjania sect, a friend of the Afghans, and an inveterate enemy of the Sikhs.Sardar Singh Bhatia, \\"Vadda Ghalughara\\", The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Volume IV, Patiala, Punjabi University, 1998, pp. 396. Aqil sent messengers to Durrani pleading for his help against the Sikhs. The Afghan forces hurried to Jandiala, but by the time they arrived the siege had been lifted and the besiegers were gone. The Sikh fighters had retreated with the view of taking their families to safety in the Haryana desert east of their location before returning to confront the invader. When the Afghan leader came to know of the whereabouts of the Sikhs he sent word ahead to his allies in Malerkotla and Sirhind to stop their advance. Durrani then in less than 48 hours set about on a rapid march, covering the distance of and including two river crossings In twilight Durrani and his allies surprised the Sikhs who numbered about 30,000 with most of them noncombatants. It was decided that the Sikh fighters would form a cordon around the slow-moving baggage train consisting of women, children and old men. Then they would then make their way to the desert in the south-west by the town of Barnala, where they expected their ally Alha Singh of Patiala to come to their rescue.Syad Muhammad Latif, The History of Punjab from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Time, New Delhi, Eurasia Publishing House (Pvt.) Ltd., 1964, p. 283; Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469–1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 154. A secondhand account by the son and nephew of two eyewitnesses describes the Sikhs. \\"Fighting while moving and moving while fighting, they kept the baggage train marching, covering it as a hen covers its chicks under its wings.\\" More than once, the troops of the invader broke the cordon and mercilessly butchered the women, children and elderly inside, but each time the Sikh warriors regrouped and managed to push back the attackers. By early afternoon, the fighting cavalcade reached a large pond, the first they had come across since morning. Suddenly the bloodletting ceased as the two forces went to the water to quench their thirst and relax their tired limbs. From that point on the two forces went their separate ways. The Afghan forces had inflicted great losses on the Sikh nation and had in turn many of them killed and wounded and they were exhausted having not any rest in two days. The remainder of the Sikhs proceeded into the semi-desert toward Barnala. Ahmad Shah Durrani's army returned to the capital of Lahore with hundreds of Sikhs in chains. From the capital, Durrani returned to Amritsar and blew up the Harimandir Sahib which since 1757 the Sikhs had rebuilt. As a deliberate act of sacrilege, the pool around it was filled with cow carcasses.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I: 1469–1839, Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1978, p. 154-55. It was estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 Sikhs were killed on 5 February 1762.

Gordon Isaacs, the first patient treated with the linear accelerator (radiation therapy) for retinoblastoma in 1957. Gordon's right eye was removed January 11, 1957 because the cancer had spread. His left eye, however, had only a localized tumor that prompted Henry Kaplan to try to treat it with the electron beam. Gordon is now living in the East Bay, and his vision in the left eye is normal. Henry Seymour Kaplan (April 24, 1918–February 4, 1984) was an American radiologist who pioneered in radiation therapy and radiobiology. His career Kaplan earned his degree from Rush Medical College in Chicago, after which he trained at the University of Minnesota, Yale University and the National Cancer Institute. He once said he became interested in oncology after his father died of lung cancer, the same disease which killed Dr. Kaplan, a non-smoker. Together with Edward Ginzton, he developed the first medical linear accelerator in the United States while he worked at the Stanford University Medical Center of Stanford University. The six million volt machine was first used for treatment in 1956, soon after the earliest linac-based radiation therapy, first used in London, England, in 1953.Thwaites DI and Tuohy J, Back to the future: the history and development of the clinical linear accelerator, Phys.

The patient survived into adulthood with normal vision in his left eye. His main focus was on Hodgkin's disease, which was fatal before radiation therapy was used. In 1969, he became the first physician credited with the Atoms for Peace Prize. He was the first radiologist elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1972. In 1979, he received the Charles F.

On June 5, 2011, APC inaugurated Israel's first medium- sized solar field, Ketura Sun. The field stretches over 80 dunams (8 hectares or 20 acres) of land and has an installed power of 4.95MW. As Arava Power is an environmentally conscious company, it installs solar fields only on land zoned solely for agricultural or industrial use. In the Ketura Sun project, photovoltaic (PV) solar panel from Suntech company were used, in collaboration with Siemens Israel. Arava's mission is to supply Israel with 10% of its energy needs through clean, renewable solar energy.  History  Arava Power Company cites Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben Gurion, as an inspiring figure for the vision of the company. In 1956, Ben Gurion said: \\"The largest and most impressive source of energy in our world and the source of life for every plant and animal, yet a source so little used by mankind today is the sun... Solar energy will continue to flow toward us almost indefinitely.\\" In August 2008, Siemens Project Ventures invested $15 Million in the Arava Power Company. In a press release published that month, Peter Löscher, President and CEO of Siemens AG said: “This investment is another consequential step in further strengthening our green and sustainable technologies”. Siemens now holds a 40% stake in the company. On November 21, 2010, the Minister of National Infrastructure, Uzi Landau, signed a Power Purchase Agreement with Ketura Sun Company (owned by Arava Power Company) worth an estimated 250 Million NIS. The agreement is valid for twenty years and guarantees that the energy produced at Ketura Sun will be transferred to the Israel Electric Corporation's power lines. It is the first PPA in Israel with a solar energy company. In December 2010, Bank Hapoalim signed an agreement with Arava Power to extend a loan of 80 Million NIS to APC in order to fund the Ketura Sun project (valued at ~100 Million NIS). On June 5, 2011, APC inaugurated Israel's first solar field, Ketura Sun. On May 22, 2012 Arava Power announced that it had reached financial close on an additional 58.5 MW for 8 projects to be built in the Arava and the Negev valued at 780 Million NIS or approximately $204 Million.  Ketura Sun  Ketura Sun Ketura Sun is the first commercial medium size solar field in Israel, as well as the first solar field in the Middle East. The solar field is built on the premises of Ketura, an income- sharing community in the Arava Valley, in the south of Israel about 45 minutes north of Eilat. This location has some of the highest levels of solar radiation in the world and at the same time enables a direct connection to Israel's national grid. The solar field covers an area of 80 dunams (8 hectares or 20 acres) with its 18,500 Suntech photovoltaic solar panels. The total production is 9 Million kilowatt hours per year with an installation power of 4.95 MW.  Partnership with Bedouins  Bedouin project for the Tarabin Solar Field The Arava Power Company has signed multiple agreements with Bedouin families in the Negev desert to build solar fields on approximately 92 acres of land, with a production capability of up to 20 megawatts. APC has been lobbying the Israeli government to create separate solar caps for Bedouins. On February 7, 2012, Arava Power announced that it had received a license for the Tarabin Solar Field, the first solar field for the Bedouin community. Financing for the $30 Million Tarabin installation is to be provided by OPIC – the Overseas Private Investment Corporation of the United States Government. Aside from enabling the Bedouin community to benefit from governmental incentives that promote renewable energy in the Arava and Negev, solar fields provide livelihood and employment. The Israel Electric Corporation is obligated by law to buy privately produced electricity at a predictable and fixed cost. It is believed that construction of solar sites will develop the region's infrastructure. In January 2011, Musa Abu Karinat, an Israeli Bedouin who signed an agreement with Arava Power, told Haaretz “Our village has proper electricity infrastructure, so we don’t need the plant for electricity for the village. Our goal is to build a solar farm on private land owned by a particular family, and to sell the energy it will produce to the national energy grid.”  Regulatory goals Before 2006, Israel had very few government regulations and statutes regarding solar energy. The company's regulatory goals include: *Increasing the cap on medium size fields from 300 MW to 1,500 MW *Ensuring the building of transmission lines from the south to the center of the country *Rationalizing the policies of the Israel Lands Authority to promote solar power. *Passing a renewable energy law by the Knesset with a 20% renewable goal by the year 2020, in line with the European Union.  Social mission  Arava Power Company is committed to corporate social responsibility. Within the Torah’s rules for Tzedakah (charitable giving) is the law of Pe'ah. Pe’ah requires that the four corners of any field be left untouched by harvesters and saved for the poor to glean. Arava Power Company is giving Pe’ah a modern twist, dedicating the four corners of the Ketura Sun solar field to four different non-profit organizations that will benefit from the funds earned by each corner for the next 20 years. The four organizations are: * Jewish Heart for Africa: An organization which uses Israeli solar systems to power African schools, medical clinics, orphanages and solar powered water pumping systems. *Bustan: “An NGO that works with the Bedouin of the Negev for fair resource allocation, including renewable energy, as well as social and environmental justice for all peoples in the region.” * Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity: “The Foundation's mission is to combat indifference, intolerance and injustice through international dialogue and youth-focused programs that promote acceptance, understanding and equality.” *Red Mountain Therapeutic Riding Center: Located South of Ketura Sun, the Riding Center at Grofit helps disabled children from the region who are in need of therapeutic riding. Arava Power's commitment to the law of Pe’ah has been made permanent with the placement of a statue of Ruth created by former Ketura artist Gil Aruch, at the entrance to the field. The Biblical story of Ruth is one of tolerance, social-religious acceptance and justice. The Royal Tribe of Judah accepts Ruth the Moabite, the convert who comes from a foreign culture and enemy land. Solar creativity  Arava Power Company has done a variety of creative projects to raise social awareness for solar energy in Israel. Rapper Shyne recently released a new song entitled “Solar Energy”. Shyne premiered the song on June 5, 2011, at the Ketura Sun launch. Arava Power partnered with Mayumana, an Israeli dance troupe, to create a promotional video for the Israel EcoCinema Festival. The video was used a second time as Arava Power Company's video-invitation to launch of Ketura Sun in 2011.

It has also been introduced to Australia, Malawi and New Zealand; primarily for mosquito control, but also as escapees from the aquarium trade. It has been reported as having adverse ecological effects in areas where it has been introduced. The females of this species grow to a total length of , while males remain smaller.  Origins  This species originated in South America. It is mainly a freshwater fish and thrives best in areas with weak water flow. However, it is extremely adaptable and can thrive in a multitude of altered environments. For example, although it prefers temperatures between , it can survive up to SeriouslyFish: Phalloceros caudimaculatus. Retrieved 21 March 2017. and down to . The species also has a high fecundity. The dusky millions fish fish was one of the first species in its family, the Poeciliidae to be bred for aquarium usage. Ecologists also attempted to use the fish as a mosquito control; however, the mosquito fish's diverse diet affected its efficacy as a control species. The mosquito fish can eat a range of different organisms, including algae. The species wild colors  Role as an invasive species  The dusky millions fish was introduced to a variety of ecosystems both by aquarium keepers and as mosquito pest control. The NSW area of Australia has been affected the most by its presence. It reproduces and spreads well in the winter when there is a larger flow of water. Australian ecologists have tried to contain this spread by killing them with rotenone; however, the infestation persists. This species is most likely to be found in shallow areas with varying levels of vegetation, such as local ponds. The ecological impact of the dusky millions fish in Australia is pronounced. Its diet has affected populations of both native and non-native fish. An example would be the non-native species Gambusia holbrooki. It has similar features as the dusky millions fish, such as a high reproductive rate and use for mosquito control. However, its population in Australia has diminished since the introduction of the dusky millions fish. Furthermore, this dusky millions fish has also affected the food chain, as they have become prey for native bird species.

A. Rey, and published by Houghton Mifflin in 1941.Curious George on goodreads.com It is the first book in the Curious George series and it tells the story of an orphaned monkey named George and his adventures with the Man with the Yellow Hat.History of Curious George  Background  The idea for Curious George came from an earlier Rey work, Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys. One of the characters in that story is Curious George. Margret and Rey then decided to create a book entirely focused on Curious George, which was an instant success. However, Margret Rey's name did not appear on early copies of Curious George because the publisher felt that children's literature was too dominated by women. Plot The story opens with George, a little orphaned brown monkey, in the jungle of Africa. An unnamed man in a large yellow straw hat observes him through his binoculars and decides to bring the monkey home with him. He puts his hat on the ground and hides behind a tree. George, ever curious, comes down from the tree \\"to look at the large yellow hat.\\" He puts the hat on but it is so large that he could not see and this gives the man in the yellow hat the chance to capture him and put him in a bag. The Man takes George in a rowboat to his cruise ship where he gets him out of the bag and then tells George that he is taking him to a zoo in a big city and that he will like it there. He then gives George the run of the ship and tells him not to get into trouble. On deck, George sees some seagulls, tries to fly with them, and falls overboard. Luckily, the crew notices that George is missing, and spot him in the Atlantic Ocean. They throw him a lifesaver and pull him aboard. When they arrive in America, George says goodbye to the sailors, and then taken to the Man's house, has a meal. and then goes to bed. The next day, after seeing the Man make a telephone call to the zoo before leaving, George wanted to telephone too. He plays with the telephone (dialed the numbers 1 through 9) until he inadvertently calls the fire station. When the firefighters hear the call, they rush to the telephone and hear no answer. Then they look at the map (on a screen) that shows them where the telephone call had come from. Then the location gets highlighted on the signal. They are unaware that it is George and think it is a real fire. Then they get on their fire trucks quickly. But when they rush to the house, all they find is no fire but a naughty monkey (which is George). Then a skinny firefighter and a fat firefighter both grab George (after getting caught in the telephone cord). The thin firefighter grabs one arm and the fat one grabs the other; and they arrest him for the false alarm. They tell George that since he fooled the fire department, they will have to shut him in a prison where he cannot do any more harm. They take him away and shut him in a prison. George attempts to climb out through the window in order to get out of jail, but there are bars. At that moment, a watchman comes in and climbs on a wooden bed to bail George out of jail. The watchman however is so heavy that the bed tips over and pins him against the wall. This stalls the watchman and buys George enough time to run out the open door and escape. He then climbs over the guard in front of the jail on the telephone wires. Out in the street, he spots a balloon vendor and tries to grab a balloon, but ends up grabbing the entire bunch and flying off into the air. Down below, the houses and people looked like toy houses and dolls, respectively. George is carried by the breeze until it stops, leaving George on top of a traffic signal, making the traffic mixed up. The Man finds him there, buys all the balloons from the street vendor, and finally takes George to his new home at the zoo, where each animal gets its own balloon.

Rey Margret Elizabeth Rey (May 16, 1906 – December 21, 1996) and her husband Hans Augusto \\"H.A.\\" Rey (September 16, 1898 – August 26, 1977) met each other in Brazil and then moved to Paris. After moving several places to escape the Nazis, they settled down in New York. It was here that they wrote Curious George and seven other books about him including Curious George Takes a Job, which won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1960. The Reys then moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1963, in a house near Harvard Square, and lived there until Hans's death in 1977. A children's bookstore named Curious George & Friends (formerly Curious George Goes to Wordsworth) was started in the 1990s by friends of the Reys, and operated in the Square until 2011.

A. Rey and published by Houghton Mifflin in 1947. It is the second of the Curious George books and tells the story of George taking a job as a window washer.  Plot  The book picks up where the first book ends. George is living in the zoo, until he gets a key from a zookeeper and escapes his cage. In the city, George enters a restaurant where he is caught eating a pot of spaghetti and forced by the cook to wash the dishes, but he does a splendid job. As a reward, the cook takes him to a friend (who is an elevator man), who gives him a job as a window washer at a tall apartment building. As George works, he observes many people in the different windows, like a child crying because he refuses to eat spinach, or a man asleep in his bed. Once he reaches the final window, he notices it being painted and the painters knocking-off for lunch. George (thinking it would be okay to paint) lets curiosity get to him again and enters the apartment. He then proceeds to give the room a jungle theme, including painting the furniture coverings as animals. By the time he was done, the painters, the elevator man, and the apartment woman owner chase George out of the apartment down a fire escape. George thinks he would be home free when he jumps down, but unlike the soft grass in the jungle or the zoo, the pavement turns out to be hard concrete. Since it was hard as stone (or concrete), this causes him to break his leg. Because the fall broke his leg, an ambulance arrived to take George to the hospital. Then the others look on. The woman states that George got what he deserved (which was for making her apartment room into a jungle). The elevator man tells them he knew that George would get into trouble because he was too curious. In the hospital, he is seen unhappily laying in bed with his leg in a cast hanging above him. His incident made a local paper, of which the Man with the Yellow Hat sees, so he is off to the hospital to claim him. Once George's leg has healed, he climbs out of bed and winds up tampering with a bottle of ether, which knocks him out. The Man and the nurse find him that way and, unable to shake him awake, put him under a cold shower, which does wake him up. Afterwards, George is taken to a movie studio to record a movie about his life, which he and all of his friends (whom he met during the story) are seen in a theater watching at the end of the book.  Reception  The book has received reviews from publications including School Library Journal, Kirkus Reviews, The New Yorker, and New York Herald Tribune.

Biography In 1186, when az-Zahir was 15 years of age, his father appointed him governor of Aleppo, Mosul and supporting areas which had recently been taken from the Zengids. At the same time his two older brothers were appointed, respectively, as governor of Syria (al-Afdal) and Egypt (al- Aziz). The lands that az-Zahir received had been under the control of his uncle, Saladin's brother al-Adil, and al-Adil took an avuncular interest in az-Zahir. As the third son, when he inherited in 1193 he was to owe suzerainty to his eldest brother, al-Afdal, in Damascus. However, he conducted his affairs independently from his brothers, and thus stayed out of their quarrels with his uncle Al-Adil for a while. In 1193, faced with the ongoing revolt of Zengid 'Izz al-Din in Mosul, he called upon his uncle, al-Adil, to provide the forces to suppress the revolt, which was quickly quelled. In 1194 az-Zahir received Latakia as part of a settlement in which he recognized al-Afdal's authority. However, by 1196 al-Afdal had proved himself incompetent as a ruler, and had lost the support of his uncle, al-Adil. Az-Zahir joined with his brother al-Aziz and uncle al-Adil in deposing and exiling al-Afdal. In October 1197, noting that Amalric of Lusignan had retaken the port at Beirut and that Bohemond III of Antioch was threatening the ports of Latakia and Jableh, az-Zahir destroyed the ports. Although Bohemond took the two locations, they were no longer advantageous, and he soon withdrew. At which point az-Zahir reoccupied them, and rebuilt the fortress at Latakia. While ruler in Aleppo he kept many of his father's advisors. He appointed Baha ad- Din as a qadi (\\"judge\\") in Aleppo. He brought the unorthodox as-Suhrawardi to Aleppo, but was forced to imprison him in 1191 due to the demands of the orthodox ulama (\\"men of learning\\").\\"Islamic Personalities: Muslim Scientists and Thinkers: Shihabuddin Yahya Suhrawardi\\" Tebyan Institute When al-Aziz died in Egypt in 1198 and was succeeded by his son al-Mansur, a boy of nine, al- Aziz's ministers, worried about the ambitions of al-Adil, summoned al-Afdal from exile to act as Regent of Egypt in the name of his young nephew. Early in the next year, while al-Adil was in the north suppressing an Artuqid rebellion, al-Afdal and az-Zahir came together in alliance and were joined by most of the other Ayyubid princes. Together they besieged Damascus, but as it held out for several months az-Zahir, as did other Ayyubid princes, lost interest and withdrew his troops. Al-Adil was not pleased and after conquering Egypt, he returned and reduced az-Zahir's territories to the area around Aleppo, forcing him to recognize overarching al-Adil suzerainty. During the last decade of his life he skirmished with crusaders and lent his army to support other Ayyubid princes. In 1206, King Leo of Cilicia defeated az-Zahir forces at the Battle of Amq, but was unable to secure any permanent advantage against Aleppo. In 1207, the French attacked and besieged Homs and its emir, an Ayyubid prince called Mujadid Shirkuh II, appealed to az-Zahir, whose troops lifted the siege. Of particular importance was az-Zahir's marriage in 1212 to Dayfa Khatun, the daughter of his old rival al-Adil. This marked the end of the rivalry between the two branches of the family.Humphreys, R.S., From Saladin to the Mongols: The Ayyubids of Damascus, 1193-1260 p.155 Prior to his death in 1216, az-Zahir appointed his younger son al-Aziz Muhammad (b. 1213) to succeed him.

Originally frico was prepared in the impoverished region as a way of recycling cheese rinds. There are two popular versions of the dish: one soft and thick, which is usually served in slices, and the other thin and crunchy, which can be used either as a garnish or as an appetizer. While the soft version has a long tradition, the history of the thin version is disputed. The first recipes for frico date back to around 1450 by Maestro Martino, cook of the camerlengo of the Aquileia patriarch. Frico has similarities to another Alpine dish, rösti.  Preparation  As many other traditional dishes, frico's preparation is quite simple. = Soft frico = Soft frico is made of high-fat cheese, typically Montasio, usually with potatoes and onions or optionally with other vegetables. After slicing, the potatoes and onions are roasted in a large frying pan with butter or oil. An equal weight of shredded cheese is then added to the pan. The mixture is pressed down in the pan to form a thin cake. This is roasted on one side until the cheese melts and becomes crisp and golden. After careful turning, the frico is browned on the other side. While Montasio is the typical cheese used for frico, other cheeses such as Asiago cheese or even mixtures of cheeses might be used. It can be served with polenta and red wine. = Thin frico = Thin frico For this second version a thin layer of shredded cheese is added on a frying pan, until the cheese becomes malleable and slightly crispy. As long as the frico remains warm it can be modelled into baskets, bowls or other decorative containers for food.Making a frico basket  Popular culture  Coming from a small region, frico remains relatively unknown even among Italians. It received some public attention in Italy and the United States in 2013, when Luca Manfè prepared it at the semi-finals of the fourth season of the television series Masterchef.

History Mosque of \\"El Jaazar\\" Pasha against Haifa bay, Acre. March 1959 The el-Jazzar Mosque was the project of its namesake, Ahmad Pasha el-Jazzar, the Acre-based governor of the Sidon and Damascus provinces, who was famous for his impressive public works, and defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Siege of Acre in 1799. El-Jazzar ordered the mosque's construction in 1781 and had it completed within the year.Archnet Jazzar Mosque. Despite lacking architectural training, el-Jazzar was the architect of the mosque,Philipp 2001, p. 58.Sharon 1997, p. 47. drawing up its plans and design, and supervising its entire construction. In addition to the mosque itself, the complex included an Islamic theological academy with student lodging, an Islamic court and a public library. The mosque was built for religious purposes, but its grandiose size and additional functions were also intended by el-Jazzar to serve as a means of consolidating his political legitimacy as ruler of Syria.Philipp 2001, p. 59. He modeled the mosque on the mosques of Istanbul, the Ottoman capital. The el-Jazzar Mosque was built over former Muslim and Christian prayer houses and other Crusader buildings. Building materials for the mosque, particularly its marble and granite components, were taken from the ancient ruins of Caesarea, Atlit and medieval Acre. El-Jazzar commissioned several Greek masons as the mosque's builders.Sharon 1997, p. 50. There is a tughra or monogram on a marble disc inside the gate, naming the ruling Sultan, his father, and bearing the legend \\"ever-victorious\\". Adjacent to the mosque is a mausoleum and small graveyard containing the tombs of Jazzar Pasha and his adoptive son and successor, Sulayman Pasha, and their relatives. Architecture The mosque is an excellent example of Ottoman architecture, which incorporated both Byzantine and Persian styles. Some of its fine features include the green dome and minaret, a green-domed sabil next to its steps (a kiosk, built by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, for dispensing chilled drinking water and beverages) and a large courtyard.Mosque of Ahmed Jezzar Pasha Ullian, Robert. Wiley Publishing The mosque, that is dominating Acre's skyline, was originally named Masjid al-Anwar (the \\"Great Mosque of Lights\\") and is also known as the White Mosque because of its once silvery-white dome that glittered at a great distance. The dome is now painted green. The minaret has a winding staircase of 124 steps. It is the largest mosque in Israel outside of Jerusalem. Sha'r an-Nabi The mosque houses the Sha'r an-Nabi, a hair (or lock of hair) from the beard of the Prophet Muhammad. The Sha'r an- Nabi used to be paraded through Acre on Eid al-Fitr, ending the fast of Ramadan, but is now only shown to the congregation.Elian J.

The building was named the Galvez, honoring Bernardo de Gálvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston, for whom the city was named. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 4, 1979. Hotel Galvez & Spa, A Wyndham Worldwide grand Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History Galvez Hotel circa 1911 Galveston civic leaders planned on building the Galvez Hotel in 1898 after a fire destroyed another large hotel (the Beach Hotel) on Galveston Island. After the Hurricane of 1900, the plans accelerated in order to draw tourists back to the island. The hotel was designed by Mauran, Russell & Crowell of St. Louis, Missouri using a combination of Mission Revival and Spanish Revival styles. The hotel opened in June 1911 at a cost of $1 million. On October 3, 1940, the Galvez Hotel was acquired by William Lewis Moody, Jr. During World War II, the hotel was occupied by the United States Coast Guard for two years and rooms were not rented to tourists. The Galvez's importance to the local economy was restored after the war, particularly during the late 1940s and early 1950s when gambling was popular in Galveston. However, when the illegal gambling industry was shut down in the mid 1950s by the Texas Rangers, the local economy became depressed and the Galvez deteriorated.\\"Galvez Hotel\\" Texas Historic Sites Atlas. Retrieved Dec 27, 2008. The hotel received a major refurbishing in 1965. In 1971, the hotel was acquired by Harvey O. McCarthey and Dr. Leon Bromberg. In 1979, another major renovation to the hotel was initiated by Denton Cooley, who purchased the hotel in 1978, and it became a Marriott franchise in 1989. The hotel was purchased in April 1995 by Galveston native and real estate developer George P. Mitchell. Mitchell restored the hotel to its historic 1911 look. While owned by Mitchell Historic Properties, a 1996 management agreement gave day-to-day operational control to Wyndham Hotels & Resorts under the name Hotel Galvez. The hotel has 226 rooms and suites. During Hurricane Ike in 2008, the hotel lost clay tiles from its roof and was flooded on its lower level, where the spa, health club, business offices, and laundry were located.Wirstiuk, Laryssa. \\"Hotel Galvez Reopens After Hurricane Ike\\". Preservation Magazine. Retrieved Dec 27, 2008. The hotel was built in 1911, eleven years after the devastating hurricane that killed approximately 6,000 Galveston Island residents and leveled most of the buildings on the island. The hotel occupies the site where the Beach Hotel, Electric Pavilion, and Pagoda Bathhouse once stood. The Galvez was referred to as \\"The Playground of the Southwest\\" mostly for wealthy socialites, businessmen, and celebrities. American Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson stayed at the Galvez, as did General Douglas MacArthur. Other notable names include Jimmy Stewart, Frank Sinatra, and Howard Hughes.

However, djinn can no longer ride whirlwinds safely because of global warming, so she has to fly down to the doctor in Brazil on a regular airplane. Meanwhile, John and Phillipa are invited to a Djinnverso Tournament at Mr. Vodyannoy's house, the Nightshakes. Meanwhile, Mr. Gaunt is kidnapped while his wife is away by three black druids from near Stonehenge. John and Philippa were at Mr. Vodyannoy's other house when that happened. They meet the butler, Bo. He is sad because his sister Grace was lost in the east wing which is haunted.. Also, no djinn power can be used in this Nightshakes house. John goes to see the talking boards there to try to contact Mr. Rakshasas' spirit, but he awakens an ancient Incan named Manco Capac instead. He escapes and regains his mummy from a museum. John brings Grace back to her brother and goes to the museum in his ethereal form. Another unrelated thief stole three sacred gold disks and broke somethings, and the news says a thief in Berlin stole an ancient Incan staff. The news then shows a picture of a door shaped like an eye in the Peruvian forests that leads to...nowhere. Nimrod says that it's the Eye of the Forest and leads to a place that could cause the end of the world. They fly down to Peru after consulting with Faustina, the Blue Djinn, and getting the one copy of the map to the Eye in the world. They bring Zadie Eloko with them. The tour guide is \\"Sicky,\\" who has a tattoo on his stomach that acts like Medusa. His head is abnormally small due to an accident with enemy Indians when he was young. They are nearly killed several times by unusually large animals. John later discovers that Zadie is causing it. She was hypnotized by Virgil Macreeby. Zadie accidentally makes a wish that Pizarro would \\"teach a lesson\\" to the Indians chasing them. John and Nimrod reach the Eye - the news story was a hoax. The real door is rectangular and tied with a knotted string made from human hair. John leans against a lupuna tree and gains some of its knowledge. He unties the knot and rescues the others from mummified Indians. Nimrod awakens some Inca kings who go to fight Pizarro's army. Soon Virgil Macreeby, Dybbuk and Zadie arrive. They get the disks that Nimrod stole from Zadie. They are intent on using them to make an obviously fake ritual to remake Dybbuk's powers and turn lead to gold. The three go through the door, keeping back the others by showing them a video that their father is kidnapped. Nimrod connects the dots and realizes that the disks are really polonium, lithium, and steel. The staff has a rod made of pure uranium. These could cause a nuclear explosion. A piece of uranium the size of a baseball destroyed Hiroshima—But if it is bigger (namely the uranium the land is built on) the whole world could blow up. They decide to follow after sending Layla a message through djinnternal mail. The way to Paititi is guarded by enantodromia (i.e. a wish becomes its opposite). Layla flies to America in a jet at 1500 mph and finds out where Mr. Gaunt is. She rescues him and turns the druids into rare animals. But she shared Edward's body-he is so scared that she renounces her powers(even though Nimrod said in book 2 that you can only renounce once). Meanwhile, Macreeby leaves Zadie entangled to a human hair bridge that absorbed her and goes on with Buck. John releases her and Nimrod dehypnotizes her. She follows them. While that happens, the other two cross through a row of vampire plants that want their blood. They get across but Macreeby had a concussion. They reach the temple but in the middle of the process realize Macreeby dropped the third gold disk near the plants (the polonium one). Macreeby gets it but Phil somehow apparates across. Then the plants disappear. Nimrod says her slippers are \\"gestalt\\" and that they make her desires come true. They follow to Paititi capturing Macreeby on the way. But just before they reach the city, their electronic devices stop working. Buck dropped the rod without the polonium - there will be no explosion, but only deadly radiation instead. Phil wishes up a bomb shelter with Hazmat suits. She goes up to find he has split into 2 beings, one good, one bad. The bad one crushes the good one and Phil goes back to the others brokenhearted. They are \\"gestalted\\" back to the real world and Phil buries the slippers for fear of their power. Zadie stays behind in the forest to make a school for the Indians. The bad ones lost their bad chief to Pizarro and are good now. Sicky is their new chief. Macreeby's punishment is that he stays behind to help Zadie. Nimrod plants accelerated growth lupuna trees made by Faustina near the Eye and makes them invisible so loggers don't cut them. When they grow up tall in a few years (they grow 10 times as fast as other lupunas) whirlwind travel will be safe again.

A. Rey and published by Houghton Mifflin in 1952. It is the third book of the original Curious George series and tells the story of George's new bicycle and his experiences performing with an animal show.  Plot  The Man With The Yellow Hat buys George a bicycle. George is shown doing many tricks with it, including riding backwards, and riding on the back wheel. As he's riding, he meets the local paperboy, whom he helps deliver his papers. After tossing the papers to one side of the street, he sees the road continue off somewhere he's, of course, curious about. So he rides on and doesn't deliver to the other side. He rides past a stream and sees two boys playing with boats, and decides he wants to play with boats as well, so he gets off the bike and starts folding all the papers into boats (with helpful diagrams to help the reader do the same) and set them off in the water to watch them float around. As he watches his boats float down the stream, he's still riding the bike, but because he wasn't watching where he was going, he crashed into a rock, emerging unhurt but severely damaging his front wheel. Initially not knowing what to do now (after trying to ride normally, and trying to carry the bike) he broke down crying, but then brightened up when he realized he can still ride the bike on the back wheel. As he's doing it, he comes across the trucks carrying an animal show and its director, who fix his wheel, and decide to put George in the show as a bugle player and give him a similar coat and cap to his assistant Bob. As they set up, he tells George not to get into any mischief, and warns especially of giving anything to the ostrich. However, George (in probably the only time he truly didn't listen) got too curious about that and offers his bugle to the ostrich, who snatches it and gets it lodged in his throat. The workers fight to get it out of him, then the director turns on George for not listening, takes back the coat and cap, takes him out of the show, and makes him sit on a bench until he gets sent home. George is brooding over his mistake when he notices the ostrich pull a string that allows a cage door to open and a baby bear to escape. Seeing this, he grabs the bugle (which wasn't taken from him), blows a warning fanfare, then hops on his bike and takes off after the bear. At first the workers and the director thought he was misbehaving again, until they saw the empty bear cage. By the time he catches up to the bear, it had climbed a tree, but was now hanging precariously on a branch (saying that little bears can climb up a tree easily, but getting down is much harder) scared while other workers (who chased the bear ahead of George) were standing there hoping to catch it. George gets to the tree, climbs up it, puts the bear in the empty newspaper sack he still had, and lowers him safely into the workers arms. When he gets back down from the tree, he is praised for his actions, gets the coat and cap back, and is reinstated to the show. The whole city comes to see the show, including the paperboy, the Man, and even all the residents who never got their newspapers that day due to George. Afterwards, he is praised for his act, and got to keep not only the coat and cap, but the bugle too. The Man then takes him home to go to sleep. Error: One inconsistency in the book is when George damaged his front wheel. Some illustrations show it with one dent, while others show it dented twice.

Natural resources The Nonesuch Formation has been a major source of copper, and is considered a prospective source of petroleum. =Copper= Copper was discovered in the Nonesuch in the 1800s, but early mining efforts, such as those at the Nonesuch Mine in Ontonagon County, Michigan, failed because of the difficulty of recovering the fine grains of native copper. The Copper Range Company opened the White Pine mine in Ontonagon County, Michigan, in 1955. The principal ore minerals were chalcocite and native copper. The underground mine produced copper from the Nonesuch Shale until it closed in 1995. =Petroleum= The Nonesuch Shale has sufficient organic carbon content (greater than 0.5%) to be considered a potential sourcebed for petroleum. Oil identified as Precambrian has been found seeping into the White Pine copper mine in Michigan.J.A.

The Catholic Cathedral is said to resemble a space ship when viewed with Google Earth. The town is also the Orientation Training Centre for National Youth Service corps members posted to Enugu State. Geographically, Awgu LGA is located approximately between latitudes 06 00’ and 06 19’ North of the Equator and longitudes 07 23’ and 07 35’ East of the Greenwich Meridian. Awgu LGA is bounded in the north by Udi and Nkanu West LGAs, in the west by Oji River LGA , Aninri LGA and Ivo LGA of Ebonyi State in the East and share border with umunneochi L.G.A of Abia State in the south. The name of the Traditional ruler is Egbeleli. The market is known as Orie Awgu.  History  The present Awgu LGA was created out of the greater Awgu Local government area which included Aninri and Oji River local government areas. It has a population of 390,681, according to the 2006 census. Out this, 95, 421 are males while 102, 713 are females. The distribution of population is uneven; a few areas are densely populated while many others areas are virtually uninhabitable. Majority of the population settle at the foot of the hills because of the difficulty posed by the rugged terrain and because the lowland have richer soil which support better crop yield. A study by Mozie, Arinze T. at the Department of Geography, University of Nigeria found that the settlement pattern on the hills is clustered with a nearest neighbour index of 0.82 while settlement pattern on the lowland area is dispersed with a nearest neighbour index of 1.72 The other towns in Awgu Local Government Area are: Agbogugu, Isu-Awa, Ituku, Ihe, Ogbaku, Owelli, Ogugu, Agbudu, Amoli, Mmaku, Ugbo, Obeagu, Mgbidi, Ugwueme, Nkwe, Ezere, Awgu, Nenwenta, Awgunta and Mgbowo  Geography  Awgu is marked by extensive hills especially in the western flank and lowland in the eastern side. These hills have steep slopes and could attain an altitude of about 350–400 meters above sea level with mean slope angle of 15o and a modal class of 11o. The area is marked by shales, sandstones and escarpment. Awgu formation is composed of bluish and gray, well-bedded shales which are occasionally intercalated with calcareous sandstones and shelly limestone. Also, fine to coarse grained, massive sandstone, locally cross-bedded with some pebble beds and subordinate bands of siltstone and carbonaceous shale are present. The Awgu formation is the youngest of the folded sequence in the Igbo land (Southeastern Nigeria). Awgu is drained mainly by seasonal finger-like springs and streams. They dry up during the dry season (November- March) and yield more water in the wet season (April to October). Most of the streams obtain their source from top of the hills and flow downhill. In the rainy season runoffs are collected by the streams thereby increasing their volume and velocity. Due to the muddy nature of the streams channels, the water is usually colored after heavy downpour. The streams carry a lot of debris as they flow from their source (hill top) to the settlement areas down hill (lower course). The stream load (debris) makes the water dirty therefore not suitable for domestic use. Many people that reside at the very lower course of the streams are affected and they have to trek up to the middle course (foot of the hills) to collect water. The area lies within the guinea Savannah vegetation zone. Vegetation in the study area varies with topography. Natural vegetation is denser at the valley and sparse at the top of the hills. Graminoids cover the area while trees are dominant on the plain. The top and slope face of the hills are more covered by grasses such as Andropogon gayanus, Ctenium spp, Hyparrhenia barteri etc. The common tree species found are Isoberlina doka, Anona senegalensis etc. This pattern of vegetation has been ascribed to relative dryness during the dry season, favorable soil conditions and human interference in bush burning. On the hills, shattered sites have trees dominating in colonies and that these colonies in shattered sites are characterized by favorable soils and soil water holding capacity  Economy  The major economic activity for majority of the population is subsistence farming and crops such as cassava, yam, cocoyam, vegetables, maize, etc. are grown. Bush fallowing, mixed cropping and shifting cultivation are some of their farming practices. Livestock rearing is also common among some of the people. Palm wine extraction and stone quarrying are other economic activities also undertaken in Awgu. The major market in Awgu LGA is the Oye market. Various farm products are traded in the market on wholesale and retail basis every four days. Many of the people take their farm produce to sell in the market in exchange for other commodities they cannot produce. People from Nkanu and Enugu urban also patronize the traders in this market especially for cassava and vegetables.

However, a number of cities and regions in the U.S. have notable Mardi Gras or Carnival celebrations. Most of these places trace their Mardi Gras celebrations to French, Spanish, and other Catholic colonial influences on the settlements over their history. The earliest Carnival celebration in North America occurred at a place on the west bank of the Mississippi river about 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) downriver from where New Orleans is today; this Mardi Gras on the 3rd of March 1699 and in honor of this holiday, Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville, a 38-year-old French Canadian, named the spot Point du Mardi Gras (French: \\"Mardi Gras Point\\") near Fort Jackson.https://blog.education.nationalgeograp;hic.org/2016/02/07/guest_blog_series_some_mardi_gras_thoughts_and_memories/ The earliest organized Carnival celebrations occurred in Mobile, Biloxi, New Orleans, and Pensacola, which have each developed separate traditions.

Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, in the late 17th century, when King Louis XIV sent the pair to defend France's claim on the territory of Louisiane, which included what are now the U.S. states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The expedition, led by Iberville, entered the mouth of the Mississippi River on the evening of March 2, 1699, Lundi Gras, not yet knowing it was the river explored and claimed for France by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1683. The party proceeded upstream to a place on the west bank about 60 miles downriver from where New Orleans is today, where a small tributary emptied into the great river, and made camp in what is now Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. This was on March 3, 1699, Mardi Gras day, so in honor of this holiday, Iberville named the spot Point du Mardi Gras (French: \\"Mardi Gras Point\\") and called the small tributary Bayou Mardi Gras. Bienville went on to found Mobile, Alabama in 1702 as the first capital of French Louisiana. \\"Timeline 18th century:\\" (events), Timelines of History, 2007, webpage: TLine-1700-1724: on \\"1702–1711\\" of Mobile.

By 1720, Biloxi was made capital of Louisiana. While it had French settlers, Mardi Gras and other customs were celebrated with more fanfare given its new status. In 1723, the capital of French Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718. With the growth of New Orleans as a city and the creolization of different cultures, the varied celebration of Mardi Gras became the event most strongly associated with the city. In more recent times, several U.S. cities without a French Catholic heritage have instituted the celebration of Mardi Gras, which sometimes emerged as grassroots movements to help accompany single people to celebrate something in late Winter which is often dominated by the commercialized and couple-centric Valentine's Day, and as a result it has been co-opted as the single people's late Winter holiday. Alabama Mardi Gras is an official state holiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties. Other counties in the state grant employees a day of personal leave in lieu of Mardi Gras. = Mobile = A Mardi Gras parade on Royal Street in Mobile during the 2006 season Mobile, founded by Bienville in 1702, is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras celebrations in the United States, beginning in 1703. It was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in the United States in 1830. Mobile's Mardi Gras celebrations revolve around mystic societies, private social organizations that have been a fundamental part of the social and business fabric of the city. The mystic societies are organizations, similar to krewes in New Orleans, that present parades, masked balls, and activities for the enjoyment of its members, guests, and the public. Mystic society membership is secret. The mystic societies build colorful Carnival floats and parade throughout downtown Mobile during the Carnival season with masked society members tossing small gifts, known as \\"throws\\", to the parade spectators. Throws were first introduced in Mobile during an 1837 Cowbellion de Rakin Society parade. They initially consisted of sugar plumbs, kisses, and oranges. Currently, throws may be trinkets, candy, cookies, peanuts, women's panties, artificial roses, stuffed animals, doubloons, cups, hats, can coolers, Frisbees, medallion necklaces, bead necklaces of every variety, and the iconic Moon Pies. Mobile's mystic societies give formal masquerade balls, known as bal masqués, which are almost always invitation only and are oriented to adults. Attendance at a ball requires that a strict dress code, or costume de rigueur, be followed. The formal dress code usually involves full-length evening gowns for women and white tie with tails for male invited guests, and masked costumes for society members. The balls feature dramatic entertainment, music, dancing, food, and drinks. Balls are usually based upon a theme which is carried out through scenery, decorations, costumes, and a tableau vivant. Mobile first celebrated Carnival in 1703 when French settlers began the festivities at the Old Mobile Site. Mobile's first Carnival society was organized in 1704, when Nicholas Langlois founded Société de Saint Louis. In 1711 it was renamed the Boeuf Gras Society (Fatted Ox Society) (1711–1861). In 1830 Mobile's Cowbellion de Rakin Society was the first formally organized and masked mystic society in the United States to celebrate with a parade. The Cowbellions got their start when Michael Krafft, a cotton factor from Pennsylvania, began a parade with participants' carrying rakes, hoes, and cowbells. The \\"Cowbellions\\" introduced horse-drawn floats to the parades in 1840 with a parade entitled, \\"Heathen Gods and Goddesses\\". The Striker's Independent Society was formed in 1843. It is the oldest surviving mystic society or krewe in the United States. King Felix III and the queen of the Mobile Carnival Association aboard the MCA crown float on Royal Street during the 2010 season In 1856 six businessmen, formerly of Mobile, gathered at a club room in New Orlean's French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus. Arthur B. LaCour, New Orleans Masquerade: Chronicles of Carnival (Pelican Publishing 1952) Carnival celebrations in Mobile were cancelled during the American Civil War. In 1866 Joe Cain revived the Mardi Gras parades by portraying a fictional Chickasaw chief named Slacabamorinico while parading in costume through the city streets on Fat Tuesday.

The Order of Myths, Mobile's oldest mystic society that continues to parade, was founded in 1867 and held its first parade on Mardi Gras night in 1868. The Infant Mystics also began to parade on Mardi Gras night in 1868, but later moved their parade to Lundi Gras. Blow House in the Order of Athena parade down Royal Street during the 2010 season The Mobile Carnival Association was formed in 1871 to coordinate the events of Mardi Gras. That year was also the occasion of the First Royal Court at which was crowned the first king of Carnival, Emperor Felix I. The Comic Cowboys of Wragg Swamp were established in 1884, along with their mission of satire and free expression. The Continental Mystic Crew mystic society was founded in 1890; it was Mobile's first Jewish mystic society. In 1894 the Order of Doves mystic society was founded and held its first Mardi Gras ball. It was the first African-American mystic society in Mobile. In 1929 the Infant Mystics, the second oldest society that continues to parade, introduced the first electric floats to Mobile. In 1939 the Colored Carnival Association was founded and had its first parade; it was later renamed the Mobile Area Mardi Gras Association. In 1980 the Order of Osiris, the oldest surviving gay and lesbian mystic society in Mobile, held its first ball. In 1995 the 1st Mobile International Carnival Ball was held, with every known Mobile mystic society in attendance. In 2002, Mobile celebrated its Tricentennial with parades representing every known mystic society. A documentary film, The Order of Myths, was released in 2008 with a focus on Mardi Gras celebrations and how race and class influences many aspects of Mardi Gras in the city, including the mystic societies. According to statistics from the Alabama Tourism Department, Mobile Mardi Gras is the most- attended annual event in the state. The event attracted more than 800,000 people in 2010 and more than one million in 2011. =Demopolis= Demopolis, another Alabama city with French roots, has held an annual Mardi Gras masquerade ball since 2008. The ball, hosted by the Marengo County Historical Society, is held at one of the city's historic mansions, Lyon Hall. The city was founded and named by a group of French expatriates, a mix of exiled former Bonapartists and other French migrants who settled in the United States following the overthrow of the colonial government in Saint-Domingue (Haiti). The name means the People's City or City of the People. First settled in 1817, Demopolis is one of the oldest continuous settlements in the state outside of coastal Alabama. ArkansasEureka Springs= Eureka Gras is a celebration of Mardi Gras in the Ozark Mountain resort town of Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Begun in 2006 as a \\"one car parade\\" conducted by New Orleanian Daniel Ellis after he moved to Eureka Springs in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it is now run by a so-called \\"Krewe of Krazo\\" (\\"Ozark\\" spelled in reverse) and has grown into a month-long celebration with a parade running more than an hour, multiple balls, and other events.Juliana Goodwin, \\"Eureka Springs brings Mardi Gras to the Ozarks\\", Springfield News-Leader, January 23, 2016. CaliforniaSan Francisco= Carnaval San Francisco is an annual street parade and festival in San Francisco at the end of May. =San Diego= As of 2005, there is a corporate-sponsored party in the Gaslamp Quarter of downtown San Diego.\\"Bourbon Street in San Diego\\", The San Diego Union-Tribune, February 7, 2005 . In addition there is a San Diego Brazil Carnival Ball that is part of the San Diego Carnival Mardi Gras season. =San Luis Obispo= Mardi Gras celebrations in San Luis Obispo have been controversial in recent years. In 2005 leaders of this Central California city called for an end to public celebrations, as the city had become a destination for students from across the state, and celebrations had gotten out of control. FloridaPensacola= Pensacola, Florida hosts a Mardi Gras Celebration. The Pensacola celebrations also use Moon Pies in combination with beads, coins, candies & Krewe-related trades. The Pensacola festivities and the Krewes that sponsor them often are more light-hearted and family-oriented than some in other venues. The name of a number of the Krewes are puns of the names of historic Krewes in New Orleans and Mobile. The annual Pensacola celebration, is among the oldest in the United States, dating back to 1874. Festivities typically took place on the eponymous Tuesday itself and the preceding week. The first organized secular celebration of Carnival in Pensacola was in 1874, when a group of men including B. F. Yniestra, D. G. and F. C. Brent, D. K. Huckley and Dr. J. C. Whiting established the Knights of Priscus Association. The name Priscus came from Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth king of Rome who: > was the first Roman king to wear a purple robe, and golden crown on his > head. He established the circus or place where games could be held, also > increased the number of Roman knights, and built a stone wall around the > city. His majesty of our carnival, like his prototype of old Rome, knows > that \\"A little folly now and then / Is relished by the best of men.\\" The event became unorganized, having \\"fallen entirely into the hands of individual merry-makers and frolickers who disported themselves as their own wild merriment dictated,\\" but was reorganized by the Clerks Union in 1900. They formed the Pensacola Carnival Association with a 12-person committee led by chairman J. I. Johnson. Priscus remained the title of the festival's ceremonial king, and Alexander Clement Blount II was named the first King Priscus of the new group. Pensacola's first ladies mystic society, the \\"Pompadour Mystic Society\\" (the Pompadours), held its first annual Mystic Ball at the Armory Hall on February 19, 1909, crowning Dudley Thornton as King.The Pensacola Journal 2/20/1909 The \\"Revellers of Ariola\\", Pensacola's first male mystic society, was organized in 1909The Pensacola Journal 12/26/1909 and held its first Tableau Ball at the K of C Hall on January 28, 1910 crowning Miss Cornelia Bass as Queen of Ariola.The Pensacola Journal 01/26/1910 In 1936, the female krewe \\"Merry Markers\\" held its first ball in 1936.Ball Program With the exception of the Pompadours, these founding Carnival Season organizations remain active in Pensacola's celebrations to this day. The public celebration is currently organized by Pensacola Mardi Gras, Inc., and Pensacola Mardi Gras krewes parades and balls occur in the weekend prior to Fat Tuesday. Parades are on Friday night (\\"Krewe of Lafitte\\"), Saturday afternoon (the \\"Grand Parade\\"), and the \\"Krewe of Wrecks\\" parade on Pensacola Beach on Sunday. No parades are held on Mardi Gras, itself. Many krewes in Pensacola are smaller than in Mobile or New Orleans, so typically a parade has floats sponsored by numerous different krewes, rather than a single krewe having its own parade. Older krewes holding Carnival balls but do not parade, include the Rebellaires (1947), Pierrettes, Mystic Maids sand Marionettes. Parading krewes include: Krewe of African Kings, Krewe of African Queens, Krewe of Andres de Pez, Krewe of Aphrodite, Krewe of Avant Garde, Krewe of Brewe, Krewe of Hip Huggers, Krewe of Jesters, Krewe of Lafitte, Mayoki Indians, Krewe of Nauga, Krewe of Seville, Krewe of the Silver Slipper, Krewe of Warriors, Mystic Krewe of Nereids, Krewe du YaYas, Order of Odin and Krewe of Gatsby Girls. =Hollywood= Hollywood, Florida hosts Mardi Gras festivities in the downtown area and a Fat Tuesday celebration on Hollywood Beach Broadwalk with live entertainment and Creole food. Fiesta Tropicale emerged from a Hollywood tradition that started in 1935 as Fiesta of the Nations, a celebration of different cultures featuring performances by costumed children at Hollywood Central School. In 1997, a core group of Hollywood residents re-established the Mardi Gras celebration as Fiesta Tropicale of Hollywood, Inc. where krewes built floats and second lined through the downtown business district. =Orlando= In Orlando, the Universal Studios Florida theme park hosts an annual Mardi Gras celebration. This event features concerts by top musical acts, a Mardi Gras parade, and more. The event takes place over multiple weekends from February to April at the park, and is included with the regular daily admission to the park. =Tampa= in Tampa, Florida the Gasparilla Pirate Festival is an annual event started in 1904, that was inspired by Mardi Gras and carnival. The festival hosts three parades during Gasparilla season that feature community and local Krewe organizations. There is an invasion fleet boat parade, a marathon, an art festival, and a music festival branded by Gasparilla. LouisianaNew Orleans= Engraving of a Mistick Krewe of Comus night parade during the Mardi Gras season in 1858 New Orleans Mardi Gras celebrations draw hundreds of thousands of tourists to the city to mingle with the locals at the famed parties and parades. As many as a half-million spectators have been estimated by officials to line the route of major parades. The first Mardi Gras festivities in Louisiana were held on March 3, 1699. On that day, a group of French explorers set up camp on the west bank of the Mississippi River, about 60 miles downriver from what is now New Orleans. The group's leader, Pierre Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur d'Iberville dubbed the spot La Pointe du Mardi Gras. Three hundred years later, the Rex organization put a marker at the site. An account from 1743 notes that the custom of holding Carnival balls was established by that date, during the time when Bienville was governor. On Mardi Gras, there were masques and processions in the streets of the city, although they were, at times, prohibited by law. The celebrations were quickly resumed whenever restrictions were lifted or the enforcement of them was lax. In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner, raised the money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. Mardi Gras parade on Canal Street during the early 1890s On Mardi Gras of 1857 the Mistick Krewe of Comus held its first parade. Comus is the oldest continuously active Mardi Gras organization. It originated a number of traditions that continue today (such as the use of floats in parades) and is considered the first Carnival krewe in the modern sense of the term. In 1875, the state of Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal holiday. Economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to the cancellation of some or all of the major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I and World War II, but Carnival has always been observed in the city in some way.Sparks, R. “American Sodom: New Orleans Faces Its Critics and an Uncertain Future”. La Louisiane à la dérive. The École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales Coloquio – December 16, 2005. The last large parades went through the narrow streets of the city's old French Quarter neighborhood in 1972. Larger floats and crowds and safety concerns led the city government to prohibit big parades in the Quarter. A night parade on St. Charles Avenue during the 2012 Mardi Gras season. In 1991, the New Orleans city council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, in order to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.Three centuries of Mardi Gras history. From: carnaval.com. Retrieved October 19, 2007. The ordinance required these and other private social groups to abandon their traditional code of secrecy and identify their members for the city's Human Relations Commission. In protest, the 19th century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.Deja Krewe. The Times-Picayune. Retrieved October 19, 2007. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season, but returned to the parade schedule in 2000. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal of their decision. Today, many krewes operate under a business structure – membership is open to anyone who pays dues to have a place on a parade float. Float-making in New Orleans The effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans in late 2005 caused a few people to question the future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations. The city government, essentially bankrupt after the storm, pushed for a massively scaled back celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule, scaled back but less severely than originally suggested. The 2006 New Orleans' Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, then several parades on Saturday, the 18th, and Sunday the 19th, followed by six days of parades starting Thursday night, the 23rd, until Mardi Gras Day, the 28th. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades that went through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Restrictions were placed on the amount of time parades could be on the street and how late they could go. Costumed revelers during the 2011 Mardi Gras season Louisiana State troopers and National Guard assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Many of the floats had been partially submerged in the floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats. Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly impacted by the storm, and many had lost most or all of their possessions, but their enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense than usual and celebrated as an affirmation of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city, with references to MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and local and national politicians. It is impossible to estimate how synonymous Mardi Gras and New Orleans have become in popular culture. In 1926, Ferde Grofe wrote an orchestral cycle called the Mississippi Suite, the last movement featuring a musical depiction of Mardi Gras in the French Quarter. Since then the influence of Fat Tuesday on American culture has only increased, as evidenced by the wealth of songs, films, and television shows about the notorious festival. =Alexandria= Alexandria, which is located in the heart of Central Louisiana (CenLa), enjoys a blend of Mardi Gras traditions in keeping with the area's reputation as the \\"cultural crossroads\\" of the state. In addition to Mardi Gras balls, parties, and other functions, it hosts several parades, including the Alexandria Mardi Gras Association (AMGA) Krewe Parade, traditionally on the Sunday before Mardi Gras, a Children's parade, and the \\"Krewe of Provine\\" Parade, usually held on Mardi Gras Day. In 2008, the \\"College Cheerleaders and Classic Cars\\" parade made its debut with warm reception. The area's parades are known for their mix of traditional Mardi Gras fun and revelry with a family-friendly environment. They attract people from as far away as Texas and Mississippi. =Baton Rouge= Mardi Gras in Baton Rouge, 2006 Baton Rouge hosts eight parades, including the Spanish Town Parade, Krewe of Southdowns, Krewe of Mutts (dog parade), Krewe Mystique, and Parades such as the Krewe of Orion, Krewe of Artemis, Krewe of Jupiter, and Krewe of Poseidon(new for 2010) which offer more of a traditional New Orleans-style parade. All parades take place downtown, with the exception of the annual Southdowns parade, which runs through the Southdowns subdivision just south of Downtown. =Houma= Houma hosts a significant Mardi Gras celebration of ten parades, two of which roll on Mardi Gras day, and the others on the two weekends preceding the big day. King Houmas rules on Fat Tuesday itself. Law enforcement officials estimated that in 2008, more than 150,000 people lined the route of his parade. Mardi Gras has been celebrated annually in Houma since 1947. \\"Krewe of Hercules\\", \\"Krewe of Aquarius\\", \\"Krewe of Hyacinthians\\", \\"Krewe of Titans\\", \\"Krewe of Aphrodite\\", \\"Krewe of Mardi Gras\\", \\"Krewe of Terreanians\\", \\"Krewe of Cleopatra\\", \\"Krewe of Houmas\\", and the \\"Krewe of Kajuns\\" make up the ten parades. Houma is about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans. =Lafayette= Mardi Gras parade in Lafayette Lafayette is home to the state's second largest Mardi Gras celebration, which includes eight parades of floats and bands during the Carnival season. The first parade, ten days before Mardi Gras, is the celebrity-led \\"Krewe of Carnivale en Rio Parada\\", featuring over 600 riders. Parade royalty on Fat Tuesday includes King Gabriel and Queen Evangeline, named for the hero and heroine of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem; and King Toussaint L'Ouverture and Queen Suzanne Simonet, named for the great Haitian historical leaders. Mardi Gras parades have been an annual tradition in Lafayette since 1934. Recent attendance on Mardi Gras day has been estimated as high as 250,000 by police spokespersons. The first formal Mardi Gras ball and parade in Lafayette dates back to 1869. In 1897, King Attakapas, the first Lafayette Mardi Gras king was crowned. He rode into town on a Southern Pacific train decorated to look like a royal throne and led the parade. After 1897, formal Mardi Gras parades and balls seemed to come and go until 1934 when the Southwest Louisiana Mardi Gras association was formed by representatives from civic and service organizations to ensure that Lafayette would always have a Mardi Gras celebration. =Lake Charles= Mardi Gras in Lake Charles Lake Charles hosts a family-friendly Mardi Gras celebration with nine parades. With over 50 krewes, it is second only to New Orleans in the number of krewes in Louisiana. The Lake Charles Mardi Gras celebration is unique in that it is the only place in Louisiana where the public is invited to see the costumes of the all the krewes in one place, at the Lake Charles Civic Center.http://www.fortpolkguardian.com/entertainment/x664190778/Mardi- Gras-in-Lake-Charles-offers-activities-for-adults-children Mardi Gras began in Lake Charles as early as 1882 when King Momus landed on the lakefront to begin the celebration. With the onset of the World Wars, Mardi Gras in Lake Charles was not celebrated as much, but was revived in the latter part of the century. This celebration begins in Lake Charles on January 6 each year. The last parade is the Krewe of Krewes Parade in downtown Lake Charles. Mardi Gras in Lake Charles regularly draws 150,000 people. In addition, Mardi Gras can be enjoyed in Lake Charles year round at the Mardi Gras Museum of Imperial Calcasieu, which features elaborate costumes and an interactive float. This museum houses the world's largest collection of Mardi Gras costumes. =New Roads= Mardi Gras parade in New Roads, 1949 New Roads another Mardi Gras celebration outside New Orleans.Costello, Brian J. A History of Carnival in Louisiana, New Roads Printing, 2003. The family-friendly celebration has been an annual event since 1922 and includes two parades on Fat Tuesday: the Community Center Carnival parade, one of the nation's oldest African-American sponsored events, which rolls in the morning; and the New Roads Lions Carnival parade, the first-known Mardi Gras parade to be staged as a charitable fundraiser, which rolls in the afternoon. Each parade consists of as many as 35 floats built fresh each year, and 10 marching bands and drill units. Unlike the exclusivity of krewe parades in New Orleans and other cities, New Roads' parades are open to public participation, with local schools, churches, organizations, businesses and families building, entering and riding the floats. New Roads' proximity to the Baton Rouge metropolitan area results in an unusually large number of visitors to the New Roads parades, the town's normal size considering. Law enforcement officials have estimated New Roads parade attendance as high as 100,000 in years marked by favorable weather.Costello, Brian J.

Some of them include Atlas, Sobek, Harambee, Centaur, Gemini, Highland, and Asclepius. Thousands of people come to Shreveport to see the parades each year. History has it that Shreveport was said to had Mardi Gras parades beginning after the Civil War. However, the Great Depression ended the celebration for years. In 1989 the parade tradition was renewed by the Krewe of Gemini parade. With their New Orleans style floats, Gemini has grown to the biggest krewe in Shreveport, peaking at over 300 members a couple of years ago. =Courir de Mardi Gras= Courir de Mardi Gras (Mardi Gras run) participants playing music In parts of Cajun country, such as Eunice, Basile, Church Point and Mamou, the traditional Courir de Mardi Gras (French for the \\"Mardi Gras Run\\") is still held. Le Capitaine leads masked men on horseback to gather ingredients for making the communal meal (usually a gumbo). Participants gather in costume and move from home to home requesting ingredients for the night's meal. This rural Mardi Gras draws on traditions that are centuries old. Revelers sing \\"La Chanson de Mardi Gras\\", a song echoing medieval melodies. People escape from ordinary life partly through the alcohol many consume in their festive quest, but more so through the roles they portray in costume. As they act out their parts in a wild, gaudy pageant, they are escaping from routine existence, freed from the restraints that confine them every other day of the year. The capitaine maintains control over the Mardi Gras. He issues instructions to the riders as they assemble early in the morning and then leads them on their run. When they arrive at a farm house, he obtains permission to enter private property, after which the riders may charge toward the house, where they sing, dance, and beg until the owner offers them an ingredient for a gumbo. Often, the owner will throw a live chicken into the air that the maskers will chase, like football players trying to recover a fumble. By mid to late afternoon, the courir returns to town and parades down the main street on the way to the location where the evening gumbo will be prepared. =Other Louisiana cities= The \\"Knights of Nemesis\\" parade rolled through Chalmette in 2006 despite the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Other Louisiana cities holding Mardi Gras parades include Bogalusa, Bush, Chalmette, Columbia, Covington, Gretna, Kaplan, La Place, Madisonville, Mandeville, Metairie, Minden, Monroe, Natchitoches, Pearl River, Slidell, Springhill, and Thibodaux. Because of violent activities of the American terrorist group, the Ku Klux Klan, Louisiana has a state law prohibiting the wearing of hoods and masks in public. Mardi Gras is one of the occasions when exceptions are allowed, as are Halloween celebrations and religious observance. MichiganDetroit= Michigan's first Catholic settlers were French. The Fat Tuesday celebrations of modern times in Detroit stem from the more recent influence of the Polish Paczki Day.

(1984). Chez Les Canses: Three Centuries at Kawsmouth. Kansas City: Lowell Press. the city has not had a significant French Catholic population since the late 19th Century. The St. Louis Mardi Gras was revived in the early 1980s by bored, drunk patrons of Hilary's bar in the Soulard neighborhood adjacent to downtown, when they decided to march to another neighboring bar. Over the years, what started as a private party has grown in size and scale, and has attracted major corporate sponsorship, On the second Saturday before Mardi Gras, there is a family-oriented \\"Krewe of Barkus\\" pet parade with corporate sponsorship by Beggin' Strips. Participants consist of anyone who dresses up their pet in costume, and walks their pet along the parade route. The parade is followed by the informal Wiener dog races. Then, on the Saturday before Fat Tuesday, the more adult-oriented, flesh-for-beads parade occurs, although there have been various attempts to reserve a family section at one end of the route. People from all over storm the streets with beers and bead necklaces after the Saturday parade. The streets of Soulard, Geyer, Allen, Russell, Ann, Shenandoah, and others are crowded with people from 7th to 12th Street. The Fat Tuesday parade occurs in the evening. In recent years it has been moved from just north of Soulard to downtown St. Louis. The majority of the overall Mardi Gras festivities have corporate sponsorship, primarily from Anheuser-Busch and Southern Comfort. In 2006, this led to an investigation by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and the Missouri Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control into the legality of Mardi Gras Inc.'s sponsorship deals. OklahomaTulsa= In 2010, Tulsa began holding an annual Mardi Gras parade through its downtown Blue Dome District.Jason Ashley Wright, \\"Mardi Gras parade to feature iconic dress\\", Tulsa World, March 8, 2011. OregonPortland= In 2010, a group of Louisiana expatriates and friends founded the Mysti Krewe of Nimbus Mysti Krewe of Nimbus to bring Mardi Gras and Louisiana culture to the Pacific Northwest and Portland in particular. Lacking in any formal Mardi Gras festivities, the Krewe held the first Portland Mardi Gras Ball Portland Oregon's Mardi Gras Ball the Saturday before Mardi Gras. The Ball is now in its fourth year. Krewe activities have grown to include a Mardi Gras Day parade on Mississippi Avenue, a float entry in the annual Rose Festival Starlight Parade and second line parades at the Safeway Waterfront Blues Festival. PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia= There is an unofficial celebration of Mardi Gras on South Street every year. There is a noticeable police presence because of widespread drunkenness and looting that occurred among some of the younger participants in 2001. Local restaurants include New Orleans' themes, such as Fat Tuesday's, Les Bon Temps, and Nola's. Texas Mardi Gras in Galveston =Galveston= Galveston, Texas is home to the largest Mardi Gras festival in Texas, which attracts up to 200,000 revelers to the island each year. The celebration in Galveston dates back 1867, when it consisted of merely a masked ball and a theatre performance of Shakespeare's \\"King Henry IV.\\" The emergence of rival Krewes the \\"Knights of Momus\\" and the \\"Knights of Myth\\" led to the first extravagant Mardi Gras celebration in 1871. The island tradition now includes many night parades, masked balls and exquisite costumes. The current Mardi Gras was revived in 1985 by George P. Mitchell; unlike its New Orleans counterparts, there are no celebrations held on the Monday prior to Fat Tuesday. Since 1987, the Galveston Park Board has managed the event despite its struggles and successes. Prior to Hurricane Ike, promoters from the Galveston Park Board usually charge admission fees on the first weekend during Mardi Gras season kickoff events within the Strand Entertainment District (bounded by 25th Street, Harborside Drive, 20th Street, and Market Street/Avenue D). Parades on Seawall Boulevard are free to the general public. Around 2007, the Park Board slashed $800,000 in their budget due to deficits, and decided to drop the admission fee for the 2008 season and forgo live music performances. After Ike's devastation of Galveston Island, there was no admission charge in 2009 and 2010; it was believed at the time that \\"Mardi Gras! Galveston\\" was becoming like its New Orleans counterpart, where no admission fees are imposed. An editorial by the Galveston County Daily News in 2007 suggested that Mardi Gras should be operated like \\"Dickens on the Strand\\" as a manageable event under a nonprofit like the Galveston Historical Foundation similar to the Port Arthur, TX Mardi Gras (produced by Mardi Gras of Southeast Texas, Inc). Around April 2010, Galveston businessman Mike Dean, who runs Yaga's Entertainment, Inc. (the producer of the annual Galveston Food and Wine Festival and Chili Quest Festival), entered into a bidding process to become the new Mardi Gras promoter from 2011 – 2015 under a five-year contract, made official on November 18, 2010 as voted on by members of the Galveston City Council. The admission fee has returned – which now includes both weekends prior to Fat Tuesday despite the hiring of 30 security officers to augment local law enforcement. Statistics from the Galveston Convention and Visitor's Bureau have stated that with the admission fees for both weekends, crime has dropped 50% and Galveston Police Chief Charles Wiley (prior to his 2012 retirement) is backing the admission fee despite opposition from Downtown Galveston businesses on The Strand and Mechanic Street. Revelers and vendors who usually frequent Mardi Gras on Galveston Island have concerns that the admission fee will bring fewer attendees along with financial uncertainty when the Park Board sold admission tickets prior to the 2008 season. The March 5, 2011 Knights of Momus Parade attracted 20,000 revelers within the Strand while the crowd estimate during the entire Mardi Gras season is 250,000. Vendors and Downtown Galveston businesses have reported a drop in their sales despite the promoter bringing more live music, parades, and added security which includes metal detectors and bag checks. As a downside, Yaga's Entertainment Inc. incorporated the rules and regulations modeled on Mardi Gras DFW – including a prohibition on professional video and still camera equipment within the Strand Entertainment District because of the production of live entertainment from national touring or band acts. Ticket sales for the first weekend of the 2012 season dropped to 30% during the first weekend despite the numerous complaints vented at Yaga's Entertainment, Inc. - Dean stated that the admission charge will remain indefinitely until the existing 5-year contract with the City of Galveston is up for renewal. Admission pricing at the entry gates averaged $17 where discounted $8 tickets were available from the Yaga's Entertainment Inc. website (www.YagasPresents.com). Decreased ticket revenue was also attributed to the cold temperatures and high winds on the first weekend, and heavy precipitation on the second weekend - changes for the 2013 season would include contingency planning where events can be rescheduled by time shifts. As of January 2013, the $17 admission fee is still imposed by Yaga's Entertainment - one Strand business, Crow's Southwest Cantina, has circulated a petition since Dean is allegedly profiteering but has stated that a free Mardi Gras is unsustainable. Houston TV station KTRK has stated that Mardi Gras! Galveston is becoming too expensive where local merchants are losing out just to pay to be on a public street. Galveston Convention Center and Visitor Bureau chair Leah Cast stated on FOX 26 Houston that charging the admission fees brings in a quality event inclusive of Grammy-nominated musicians and balcony parties. A few Strand-area businesses claim that the admission fee keeps out the undesirable elements - during the February 9, 2013 festivities in the Strand Entertainment District, seven revelers who refused to leave the entertainment district were arrested by the Galveston Police Department during the street sweep where the police clear The Strand of all revelers. Angry revelers threw beer bottles, trash cans, and barricade fencing at the police where video footage were posted on YouTube. Over a year later during the March 1, 2014 Mardi Gras weekend, the same incident was repeated but Galveston Police officers fired tear gas at 19 partygoers who refused to comply with the police order to disperse. In January 2015, the City of Galveston issued a Request for Qualifications concerning the future promoter of the Strand Entertainment District where the same criteria proposed for the 2011-15 contract will remain the same (live entertainment from national touring acts limited to recording artists, bands, along with paid admission (on Fridays and Saturdays prior to Fat Tuesday with free admission on Sundays - this was amended during the latter part of the previous 2011-15 contract) and gated checkpoints/bag checks (which is stipulated under the new contract in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing) but the contract (which lasted five years without a contract extension) is limited to 3 years where the City of Galveston can reserve the right to extend the contract for an additional two years. Some Strand businessowners who voiced their displeasure with Yaga's Entertainment would rather have the Strand Entertainment District managed like the Lone Star Rally since they do not set up gated checkpoints - their touring acts (live music) are usually performed at 2 stages. =Port Arthur= Port Arthur began celebrating Mardi Gras in 1993.Portarthur.com History of the Mardi Gras celebration , Port Arthur Website =Dallas= Dallas, Texas is home to a Mardi Gras celebration, MystiQal.

Its creation was passed in 1863, and was part of Ildefons Cerdà's urban plan, appearing as L Street in 1867, even though that name was never approved. Instead, another name, a reference to the Crown of Aragon, was proposed in 1863 by Víctor Balaguer, who was commissioned by the city council to rename all the streets in the area.

Barnsley, UK: Seaforth, p. 83. is an inlet or fjord in the central part of the city of Bergen in Vestland county, Norway. An arm off of the main Byfjorden, the Puddefjorden is long and stretches from the tip of the Nordnes peninsula to the Solheimsviken bay at the entrance to the Store Lungegårdsvannet bay. The fjord is at its widest, between Nordnes and the inner part of the borough of Laksevåg. The innermost part of the fjord, known as Damsgårdssundet, is much narrower, scarcely wide at its narrowest. The fjord is located next to some of Bergen's most important industrial areas, and has played a significant part in the city's development and industrialisation. History Despite being situated in the central part of the present-day city of Bergen, the Puddefjorden did not play a major role in the city's early history. The fjord experiences strong currents and has numerous small islets, rendering boat passage dangerous. Furthermore, its innermost parts used to lightly freeze over during winters. Because of that, the nearby Vågen bay was the preferred entrance to the city for nearly all water-craft traffic. The ice, islets, and strong current caused the kings of Alrekstad (today known as Årstad) to avoid using Puddefjorden. The ice also stopped an invasion attempt by Kristoffer Throndsen in 1536, when Puddefjorden went all the way in to what is now known as Lille Lungegårdsvann. Puddefjorden was originally not considered a part of the city of Bergen, but rather a nearby area. This view held until the mid-1800s. The fjord's northeastern side belonged to the city, however, and scattered habitations appeared there at the end of the 17th century, later becoming the neighbourhoods of Møhlenpris and Nøstet. The original Puddefjorden was both longer and broader than it is today, but after extensive industrialisation of the nearby areas in the 19th century, the fjord's form was altered. Formerly, the Puddefjord was wrapped around the city, ending only a few blocks away from Vågen. Following the final filling of the strait between Lille Lungegårdsvannet and Store Lungegårdsvannet in 1926, the fjord now stops in the Store Lungegårdsvannet bay. ;Changes to the fjord over the centuries Bergen-13ème.jpgMap from the 13th century Bergen 1768-map.jpgMap from 1768 Bergenskart 1877.jpgMap from 1877 Bergen-1907.pngMap from 1907 Bergen OSM.JPGMap from 2008 Bridges The first bridge across Puddefjorden was the first Nygård Bridge, opened in 1851. Since that time, three additional bridges have been built across the fjord; the New Nygård Bridge (1978), the Second New Nygård Bridge (2008), and the Puddefjord Bridge (1956). The former three cross the entrance to Store Lungegårdsvann, while the fourth spans the fjord between Møhlenpris and Gyldenpris. Environment Industry has had an environmental effect on the fjord, and its sediment has become polluted with PCB and mercury. There has never been a thorough record of the poisons released into Puddefjorden, and both smaller businesses and locals have used Store Lungegårdsvann as a disposal area. As a result, Puddefjorden is now divided into five sub-areas and the rinsing process is estimated to cost around .Statens Forurensningstilsyn See also * List of Norwegian fjords References Category:Geography of Bergen Category:Fjords of Vestland ","title":"Puddefjorden"},{"id":"20858182","text":"Friedrich Wilhelm Gerhard (24 July 1884 in Trakehnen - 16 May 1950) was a German equestrian and Olympic champion.

He is notable for his portraits, genre paintings and historic paintings. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. Early life Theobald von Oer, born at Haus Nottbeck, Stromberg, was the son of a Westphalian district administrator. His younger brother Maximilian Joseph Franz of Oer (1806–1846) was a writer. Even in his childhood von Oer liked to paint and to draw, and was talented. At the age of 12, he fell ill with scarlet fever and lost his hearing as well as parts of his speech. Another one of his paintings Adult life At 19, von Oer started with studies at the Royal Academy of Arts Dresden (today the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts). He proved himself exceptionally talented and quickly changed to further studies to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, under the teaching of W. von Schadow. In 1836, he and architect H. Matthäi travelled together through the Netherlands and Belgium, eventually arriving at Paris, visiting various French artists. In 1837 he travelled through Southern France into the Italian cities Rome, Capri, and Ischia. His main emphasis was the art of painting historical scenes, however, he painted various landscapes and portraits. His journey to Italy also had much influence on his style, notably on his landscapes and portraits. After returning to Germany, he returned to Dresden, becoming a professor at the academy of the arts. The Princess Gallitzin with her friends from the year 1864, is one of his best known commissioned works. He died in 1885, in Coswig. References 1\\\\. Literature: D.

Uruguay is one of only two countries in South America where abortion is legal on request, with the other country being Guyana.  Legislation  Prior to legalization, the punishment for having an abortion was 3 to 12 months in prison, while performing an abortion was punishable by 6 to 24 months in prison. A judge could mitigate the pregnant woman's sentence in certain circumstances. These included economic hardship, risk for the woman's life, rape, or family honor.

Abortion methods and results  Before abortion was legalized, Uruguay's women suffered 20,000 hospitalizations because of unsafe abortion every year, until a harm reduction strategy was adopted to enable women to initiate medical abortion at home. Medical abortion is non-surgical, so it does not introduce instruments into the womb; danger of infection from septic abortion is therefore much lower.  History  Abortion was made illegal in Uruguay in 1938. Many women and girls died every year from complications of unsafe abortions. In 2004, a team of professionals including gynecologists, midwives, psychologists, nurses and social workers founded a group called Iniciativas Sanitarias (\\"Health Initiatives\\"). As part of a larger goal to promote sexual rights and abortion as a \\"human right\\", they focused on unintended or \\"unwanted\\" pregnancies and their consequences. They say that women should not have to pay for abortion of the unborn child's life with their own lives, and that pregnant women have a right to health information and emotional support, as well as post-abortion medical care. Their group aims to provide both respect and confidentiality. In 2012, Uruguay decriminalized abortion. While a number of politicians and advocacy groups protested its legalization, in 2013, they failed to muster the required support for a national referendum to settle the matter, and the political positions are varied, with leaders from all the parties that think differently.

It is endemic to the Sierra Nevada foothills of California, where it is known from only two spots in El Dorado and Nevada Counties. It grows in unique habitat in chaparral on gabbro soils. It is a federally listed endangered species. Description Calystegia stebbinsii is a perennial herb producing climbing, white haired, vine-like stems approaching a meter in maximum length. The leaves are up to about 5 centimeters long and palmate in shape with 7 to 9 long, narrow lobes; the distinctive shape of the leaves make the plant easy to identify among the morning glories native to the region. The inflorescence bears flowers atop long peduncles, each flower about 3 centimeters wide and white or cream-yellow in color, sometimes tinted with pink. They are pollinated by bees and other insects.Hinshaw, G. Pine Hill Preserve Management Plan. July 2008. Like many other chaparral plants, this species has seeds which are stimulated to germinate by exposure to wildfire.The Nature Conservancy It also reproduces via rhizome. Conservation The plant's type specimen was collected by G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1970 outside of Placerville, California.USFWS. Determination of endangered status for four plants and threatened status for one plant from the central Sierran foothills of California. Federal Register October 18, 1996. The species was described to science and named for him in 1974.Brummitt, R. K. (1974). A remarkable new species of Calystegia (Convolvulaceae) from California. Kew Bulletin 29:3 499. The plant is known from only two locations, each containing a scattering of occurrences. Both locations are on the Pine Hill intrusion, a section of gabbro-based rock that oozed as magma into the surrounding rock and then solidified there, eventually becoming exposed as the softer rock around them eroded away. This gabbro intrusion yields red-colored soil that is rich in heavy metals, and some plants are adapted to this kind of substrate. C. stebbinsii grows on the gabbro soil as well as the similar serpentine soil that can also be found in the intrusion. Other species are completely limited to the gabbro sections. The Pine Hill Ecological Reserve was established to protect these unique and often rare plant species. At the time it was placed on the endangered species list, at least one third of the known occurrences of the plant had been destroyed, mostly by development of its habitat. Most of the sites that still existed were in danger of destruction. With destruction and fragmentation of the habitat come associated activity such as road construction, trash dumping, off-road vehicle use, and herbicides. The plant does not tolerate shade, and when the brush around it grows too high and shades it out, it does not survive. This suggests it requires disturbance, such as wildfire, to clear the overgrowth. Fire suppression is detrimental. Protected and managed areas of the habitat undergo controlled burns.

Ambrose was formerly the offensive coordinator of the UConn Huskies before being announced as Towson's head coach in December 2008. Ambrose played wide receiver for Towson in the early 1990s.Rob Ambrose Promoted to Offensive Coordinator Ambrose was selected as the Top FCS Coach for the 2011 season. In 2013, Towson advanced to the FCS National Championship Game for the first time in school history. Ambrose played his high school ball at Maryland's Middletown High School. Collegiate career As a player at Towson, Ambrose started his career as a quarterback, but moved to wide receiver as a sophomore. In 1990, he caught four passes for 20 yards. As a junior, he had four catches for 35 yards. Three of those receptions were touchdown passes from Dan Crowley. He caught an 11-yard TD pass at James Madison, a seven-yard TD toss at Liberty and a 14-yard TD pass against Hofstra. An injury to his hip and pelvis in the spring prior to his senior year would force Ambrose to the sidelines. Coaching careerAs a Towson Assistant= In the nine years Ambrose spent as a Towson Tiger assistant, the team went 54-36 with only two losing seasons. Ambrose started as a student-assistant before being promoted to wide receivers coach in 1993, offensive coordinator in 1997, and then to associate head coach in 2000. He coached four All-Americans in running back Tony Vinson, quarterback Dan Crowley, and wide receivers Mark Orlando and Jamal White. Vinson led the nation in rushing yards (2,016), all-purpose yards (2,073), and points scored (138) in 1993. Vinson went on to be a fifth-round draft pick of the San Diego Chargers. In 1999, Towson led the nation in passing yardage, averaging 381.2 passing yards per game. =At Catholic= Ambrose left Towson after the 2000 season to become the head coach at Catholic University, a Division III program in Washington, D.C. In one year at Catholic, Ambrose led the Cardinals to a 3-7 record. =At UConn= Ambrose joined the staff at UConn as the Huskies grew from an NCAA Division I-AA program into a major college contender. During his seven seasons in Storrs, CT, the Huskies were 49-36 with just two losing seasons. UConn made three bowl appearances in five years, debuted in the AP National rankings at 16th, and won a share of the Big East title in 2007. Joining the staff as the quarterbacks coach, Ambrose played a major role in the development of Dan Orlovsky, the first UConn quarterback to play in the NFL. Orlovsky was a fifth-round draft pick by the Detroit Lions. In 2008 as the offensive coordinator, Ambrose coached Donald Brown, an All-American and the 2008 Big East Offensive Player of the Year. Brown led the nation with 2,083 yards on 367 carries and became the first UConn player to be selected in the first round of the NFL draft. =As Towson head coach= In December 2008, Ambrose was hired as the head coach of his alma mater, Towson University. Ambrose's Tigers did not find immediate success posting a 2-9 record in 2009 and a 1-10 record in 2010. However, in 2011, just his third season as the Tigers' head coach, Ambrose guided Towson to one of the most dramatic turnarounds in college football history. The 2011 team became the \\"Turnaround Tigers\\" by going 9-3. Their 7.5 game improvement was the most dramatic improvement in NCAA Division I history. Their 9-2 regular season record included wins over six nationally-ranked teams, the team's first outright CAA championship, and the team's first appearance in the NCAA FCS Playoffs. Though they would lose in the first round to Lehigh, the playoff appearance would make Towson the first team to ever earn playoff berths at the Division III, Division II, and Division I-AA levels. Following the season, Ambrose was honored as the 2011 CAA Coach of the Year, the AFCA District Coach of the Year, and was a finalist for the Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year. In January 2012, he was the recipient of the Eddie Robinson Award as the top coach in FCS football. During the 2012 season, Ambrose led the Tigers to a 7-4 record against an extremely difficult schedule that included nationally-ranked FBS programs in LSU and Kent State. Towson would finish the season with a 6-2 CAA record, good enough for a 4-way tie for second place in the CAA, along with New Hampshire, Villanova, and Richmond. Towson was awarded a share of the CAA Championship following a ruling by the CAA that Old Dominion, who finished at 7-1 in CAA play, was not eligible to win the league title as they had declared that they were leaving the league in 2013. ODU was eligible for the FCS Playoffs, and advanced with an at-large bid, while Towson was not invited to the playoffs, and stayed home. The motivation of that disappointing end to 2012 was the spark which powered Towson's 2013 campaign, which would prove to be the most successful of Ambrose's coaching career. The Tigers would post a regular season record of 10-2 (6-2 CAA, 2nd place), earning their second playoff berth in three years. Included in those wins was the Tigers' first- ever win over an FBS program, as they defeated UConn, Ambrose's former employer, by a score of 33-18. Towson would reach the playoffs as an at-large bid and shocked the FCS world by reaching the FCS National Championship game with their wins over No. 9 Fordham, No. 2 Eastern Illinois, and No. 3 Eastern Washington in consecutive weeks. The Tigers would lose the championship game to undefeated North Dakota State, who won their third consecutive championship. The Tigers season would end with a record of 13-3 (a school record for wins), the number two ranking in the final FCS polls, with a Lambert/Meadowlands Award as the top FCS team in the East, and as the ECAC FCS Team of the Year. In addition, record-setting running back Terrance West would be drafted in the third round of the 2014 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. Coming off of an NCAA FCS National Championship game appearance the year before, the Tigers battled a plethora of injuries during the 2014 season. Their disappointing season would end with a 4-8 record (2-6 CAA) and the team would miss the playoffs. However, for the second straight year, a Tiger was selected in the NFL draft as Tye Smith was selected in the fifth round by the Seattle Seahawks. The 2015 season would see a return to Towson's recent success and winning tradition as the team posted a 7-4 (5-3 CAA) record. The team would, however, miss the playoffs for the second straight year and for the third time in four years. That success was short lived as the Tigers have posted back to back losing seasons in 2016 (4-7) and 2017 (5-6), making it 4 straight seasons of missing the FCS Playoffs. The Tigers are now 52-54 in the 9-year coaching stint of Towson alumni Ambrose, including a 35-39 CAA record.

It was the summer residence of duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.  History  The house originated at the end of the 16th century as the tenant's house (Pächterhaus) of a ducal estate (Kammergut), and was converted and extended in 1765. It consists of a main building, with an upper floor of 7 rooms, and a smaller auxiliary building connected to it. Charles Augustus granted it to his brother Constantine for his own court, under Constantine's tutor Karl Ludwig von Knebel in 1776. Four years later their mother selected it as her summer seat during a long absence of the prince. She and her two servants occupied the upper floor, with her courtier, Luise von Göchhausen, in the auxiliary building. For around 25 years the castle was Anna Amalia's favourite residence and the centre of a circle of poets, as part of Weimar Classicism. On the duchess's death in 1807 the building became neglected, though Charles Augustus's son Charles Frederick began renovation work within Goethe's lifetime. In 1907 it opened to the public as a museum, and from 1978 to 1981 it was restored to its 1800 decor, with the sequence of rooms restored to that of Anna Amalia's time. Park On the nearby meadow was a landscape garden in the English style, also open to the public. Schiller is buried in the grand-ducal burial chamber in the grounds.

Although he rose to the rank of general, his fame is as commander of G Troop Royal Horse Artillery in the thick of the fighting at the Battle of Waterloo, and as author of Journal of the Waterloo Campaign.Journal of the Waterloo Campaign kept throughout the campaign of 1815, Cavalié Mercer, first published 1870 Mercer's six-gun horse artillery troop arrived too late for the Battle of Quatre Bras, but it fought with the cavalry rearguard covering the army's retreat to Waterloo. The troop fought on the extreme right wing of Wellington's army at Waterloo, before being moved into the thick of the fighting nearer the centre of the line. There it beat off repeated charges by French heavy cavalry, disobeying orders to abandon the guns and retire inside nearby infantry squares as the enemy closed. The location of this action is marked by a memorial on the Waterloo battlefield. After the battle, Mercer's troop marched on Paris with the Allied armies, and formed part of the army of occupation. Mercer's Journal is an important source for historians of the Waterloo campaign, as well as a detailed description of the landscape and people of Belgium and France in the early 19th century. It is one of the few accounts of the period written by an artillery officer. Mercer remained in the peacetime army, twice serving in Canada. He was a painter of some merit, and a number of his watercolours of Canadian landscapes were purchased by the National Gallery of Canada in the 1980s.Artist Gallery: Alexander Cavalié Mercer  Before 1815  Mercer was born in 1783 at Kingston-upon-Hull, Yorkshire, into a military family: his father was General Alexander Mercer of the Royal Engineers. The name Cavaillie was possibly inherited from his grandmother Margaret Cavaillie, wife of James Mercer overseer at Fort George. Margaret Cavaillie (1699, St Andrews – 1777, St Andrews) was the daughter of captain James Cavaillie, who it is said came to Britain in the army of William of Orange and settled in Fife as a wine merchant and died at Cupar Fife in 1716. He went to the Military Academy at Woolwich and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery in 1799 at the age of 16.Cavalié A. Mercer (Mercer's son) in the preface to Mercer's Journal, p xix He served in Ireland in the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He was promoted to second captain (a rank unique to the Ordnance) in 1806. Promotion in the Royal Artillery was very slow, especially in peacetime, as it relied solely on seniority. Unlike in the rest of the British Army of the time there was no opportunity for purchase of commissions in the Ordnance.Holmes, Richard, Redcoat--The British Soldier in the Age of Horse and Musket, HarperCollins, 2001, p176 Mercer was not breveted as a major until 1 March 1824, though this was then backdated to 12 August 1819. Mercer was posted to G Troop Royal Horse Artillery around 1806Mercer's Journal, p 277 and joined Whitelocke's ill-fated Buenos Aires expedition in 1807. He did not serve in the Peninsular War and next saw war service in the Waterloo Campaign.  G Troop  A 9-pounder gun of 1813–1815. In 1815 Mercer was acting commander of what was officially G (Dickson's) Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, but is usually referred to as Mercer's Troop or Mercer's Battery. Its modern successor is G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery, part of 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, which currently serves in the field artillery role with 16 Air Assault Brigade, and is equipped with the L118 Light Gun. G Troop served on the 1807 Buenos Aires expedition, but the G Troop of Waterloo was formed from the amalgamation of two other RHA troops before leaving Colchester for Belgium. It had the pick of the horses from each, and was therefore regarded as an exceptionally fine unit. When reviewing the cavalry at Grammont on 29 May 1815, Blücher is supposed to have said \\"there is not one horse in this battery that is not fit for a field marshal\\".Mercer's Journal p 119 The troop had five 9-pounder guns (which had recently replaced some of the RHA's 6-pounders) and a 5½\\" howitzer, 80 gunners, 86 drivers and 226 horses.  Waterloo Campaign  Mercer's Troop embarked for Belgium on 11 April 1815, a few days after hearing of Napoleon's escape from Elba. From 1 May until the French invasion on 15 June it led a quiet life in the small village of Strijtem, west of Brussels. G Troop rode all day on 16 June, but arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Quatre Bras. It covered the retreat from Quatre Bras on 17 June, narrowly escaping capture by French cavalry. It was in the action at Genappe later the same day with the cavalry rearguard. Arriving on the field of Waterloo, Mercer's Troop briefly took up a firing position on the famous knoll behind the sandpit, which would feature in the fighting the following day. Mercer was still acting as rearguard for Wellington's army, not realising that the entire army had halted on the ridge immediately behind him. His troop exchanged fire with arriving French batteries before retiring. After a miserable, hungry night in the mud and rain in the orchard of Mont St Jean farm, where Mercer is fabled to have drunk port from a chicken shaped goblet,http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/22085.aspx Mercer found himself without orders in the opening phase of the battle, as d'Erlon's infantry attacked Wellington's left. He was about to lead his troop into action on his own initiative when he was ordered to the extreme right of the line. That was a quiet sector, but in common with much of Wellington's artillery, Mercer disobeyed orders to refrain from counter-battery fire. He engaged enemy guns, attracting heavy fire from superior enemy artillery in return. Krahmer's Dutch-Belgian horse artillery battery at Waterloo. Mercer's Troop was on the same section of the ridge in the picture. 1905 painting by J. Hoynck van Papendrecht. The memorial stone marking the position on the Waterloo battlefield where Mercer's troop fought French cavalry. In mid-afternoon Mercer's Troop was suddenly ordered into the hottest part of Wellingtons' line, between the crossroads and Hougoumont, where its position is now marked by a memorial. It deployed immediately behind the ridge road, which was on a low embankment. The bank provided excellent cover from enemy artillery and increased the effectiveness of Mercer's case-shot. The troop was between two squares of Brunswick infantry, whom Mercer regarded as unsteady. He was ordered to lead his men into the squares as cavalry closed, but decided they would be safer at their guns. Unlike all the other batteries in the sector, the troop's gunners never abandoned their guns to take refuge in the infantry squares. Massed French heavy cavalry attacked repeatedly from about 3.15 pm. The Grenadiers à Cheval of the Imperial Guard were already emerging through the smoke at the trot as Mercer's guns deployed, so the troop opened fire with case-shot at close range, causing terrible casualties. The French hesitated, then the front ranks attempted to retreat as the rear ranks pushed forward, causing them to mill about under the execution of Mercer's guns before they eventually withdrew. Charge of the French Cuirassiers at Waterloo, painting by Felix Philippoteaux (1815–1884). Before the second charge of the heavy cavalry, Mercer's Troop was harassed by close-range carbine fire from mounted French skirmishers, while Mercer held fire to conserve ammunition. To steady his men, Mercer promenaded across his troop's front on horseback, goading the enemy in French and attracting aimed but inaccurate carbine-fire in return. The second main attack came on in columns, led by cuirassiers. Mercer's Troop waited for them, double-loaded with case-shot over ball, and fired at 50 or 60 yards. Mercer reported that the whole front rank of the enemy went down, with the round-shot tearing through the column behind. The ground became virtually impassable with dead and wounded horses and men, so the enemy could not close the gun-line. Under the rapid fire of Mercer's Troop and the Brunswick infantry, the enemy fell like \\"grass before the mower's scythe\\". The greatest danger to Mercer's men came between the charges, from French skirmishers and artillery. Wellington at Waterloo painting by Robert Alexander Hillingford showing Royal Horse Artillery on the left. The third and final charge stood little chance of reaching the guns. On each occasion individual cavalrymen passed between the guns, but only so as to escape to the British rear. As the third attack withdrew, the troop had to cease firing to allow the Duke of Wellington to pass along the road. Shortly afterwards Wellington's infantry advanced, leaving the guns on the ridge to engage masses of French troops in the valley below.

It expended 700 rounds of ammunition.Haythornthwaite, Philip J., Afterword to Mercer's Journal, pp 395–396 Sir Augustus Frazer said, \\"I could plainly distinguish the position of G Troop from the opposite height by the dark mass of dead French cavalry which, even at that distance, formed a remarkable feature on the field.\\"Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Augustus Frazer, commander of Royal Horse Artillery in Wellington's army, quoted in Mercer's Journal  After Waterloo  Mercer's Troop stayed on the battlefield until 3 pm the following day, and Mercer spent the day touring the field, visiting Hougoumont and talking to the wounded. Once it had been rejoined by its ammunition and supply wagons, the troop moved off towards Nivelles, leaving some guns and carriages behind for lack of horses. It rejoined the Army near Mons on 21 June, and marched with it to the gates of Paris without seeing further action. It was ordered into cantonments at Colombes early in July 1815.Mercer's Journal, pp 185–255 Apart from two months of leave in England, Mercer spent much of the rest of the year enjoying tourist pursuits in Paris.Mercer's Journal, pp 269–374 Mercer was transferred to command D Troop RHA at Stains, also near Paris, in July 1815 and he returned with it to England in January 1816.Mercer's Journal, pp 375–388 After the campaign Mercer was put on half-pay from 31 July 1816 until 1821.

Mercer, who edited the Journal after his father's death. Mercer and Fanny lived in Berkshire at the time of the Waterloo campaign, but in later life Mercer lived at Cowley Hill near Exeter. He died there on 9 November 1868 and is buried at St. David's Church, Exeter. Today a publicly funded project is underway to restore Mercer's grave for the Waterloo 200th commemorations, to provide informative signage and to build a fund to care for the condition of the grave for the next 100 years. The commemorations will be marked on 18 June 2015 at Mercer's graveside with a short service, the laying of a laurel and rose wreath, and the respect of current serving members of Mercer's G Troop.http://www.GTroopRHA.co.uk His Journal of the Waterloo Campaign kept throughout the campaign of 1815 was published in 1870, after his death. It was written some 30 years earlier, from the original notes Mercer wrote contemporaneously, with additions and verifications from correspondence and other sources. It covers the period from April 1815 to January 1816, when Mercer returned to Canterbury with D Troop, with an interlude for his leave in England from September to November 1815. By Mercer's own admission he had little time to write his journal in the hectic few days before and after Waterloo, so his account may not be entirely reliable. The Journal is notable for its lengthy descriptions of the countryside and its people, and especially of Parisian life under the Allied occupation. Very little of it is devoted to military matters, and indeed Mercer does not seem to have devoted much time to command, spending most of his days in country walks, riding or tourism in Paris.Mercer's Journal passim  Notes  References  * Journal of the Waterloo Campaign kept throughout the campaign of 1815, Cavalié Mercer, first published 1870, Da Capo Press 1995, * The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, Todd Fisher and Bernard Cornwell, Osprey Publishing, 2004, , , pp 298–301 * Biography in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * The Battle--A History of the Battle of Waterloo, Alessandro Barbero (trans.

It encompasses sixteen blocks bounded by Armour Boulevard on the north, 39th Street on the south, Troost Avenue on the west, and Paseo Boulevard on the east. It is primarily a residential neighborhood, with businesses along Troost Avenue. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2012. History The neighborhood was developed between 1887 and 1915 by James J. Squier, and his son-in-law, Robert V. Jones. Because of its development along city transportation lines, Squier Park is considered an early streetcar suburb. James Squier, Robert V. Jones and early development James J. Squier was born in Pennsylvania in 1836. He managed a hardware store in Cambridge, Ohio with his father in 1856 before moving to Chicago to open another store. In Chicago Squier began a highly successful career in cattle. In 1872 Squier moved to Kansas City to work as a cattle buyer for the Fowler packing house and eventually amassed a great fortune. Squier, along with several other wealthy Kansas Citians, founded Citizens' National Bank in 1882. In 1889, he founded Interstate National Bank, both primarily cattlemen's banks. Squier was known throughout Kansas City as a banker and capitalist. Squier took pride in the country estate he built shortly after purchasing land between 36th and 41st Streets, Troost and The Paseo, outfitting it with a suitable residence, formal landscaping, a fishpond and deer park. Squier was aware that the Kansas City limits were moving further south and east, closer to his property. Seeing an opportunity, Squier began to divide his land into lots in the hopes of creating a residential development. But by 1900 only a small number of lots had dwellings constructed upon them, mostly north of what is now 37th Street. James J. Squier died in 1900, leaving his estate to his wife and only daughter, Cora. Squier's wife, Mary, remained in the manor house, while Cora moved to the East Coast for education and society. There she met Robert Valentine Jones, a successful residential developer, whom she married in 1902 in a ceremony at Squier Manor. The couple lived in Philadelphia before returning to Cora Squier Jones' estate in 1908. Although most of the property had been subdivided 1887, the lots still stood empty. Inspired by the opportunity, Jones formed a real estate and mortgage company, the Manheim Realty & Investment Company, in 1908. Through the company, Jones developed a new plan to subdivide the land between 37th Street and 39th Street. Jones envisioned a cohesive neighborhood where the street layout responded to the topography of the land rather than the rigid orthogonal city grid. He wanted each house to have a unique design and to stand at the center of a spacious lot. He worked with a variety of prominent Kansas City architects, as well as builders and homeowners to design high- style dwellings throughout the subdivision. As a result, many of the homes south of 37th Street were constructed in 1909 and 1910. Construction continued steadily throughout the 1910s and into the 1920s. Many of the Manheim Realty & Investment Company homes contained such luxuries for the time as hot water heat, sleeping porches, and multiple bathrooms. By 1920, the neighborhood was filled with architect-designed homes and the curve of Manheim Road created a triangular lot landscaped as a park. Numerous prominent Kansas City architects designed homes in Squier Park, including Louis Curtiss, John McKecknie, Nelle E. Peters, Selby Kerfiss, and Smith, Rea & Lovitt. The wide variety of high- style designs in Squier Park illustrates the wealth of architectural styles popular in the early twentieth century and Jones' requirement that each house have a unique design. The predominantly single-family residential neighborhood contains multiple-family dwellings, educational facilities, and a small-scale commercial building integrated into the development. Because of the neighborhood's development along city streetcar lines, Squier Park is considered an early \\"streetcar suburb\\". In 1925, Robert and Cora Jones divorced, selling the remainder of the property on which the original Squier Manor stood. The new owner demolished the residence that same year in preparation for developing the entire lot as \\"Squier Manor Community Center\\" which was to include apartment buildings, a row of businesses, a theater, and a hotel. This development never materialized and the block was subdivided in 1930 for residential development. In 1940, Bishop Lillis High School was constructed on the southeast quarter of the block. Ultimately, Jones' vision of a comprehensive cultural landscape was fully realized by the beginning of World War II. Architecture and design Squier Park has a wide variety of building designs reflecting the prolonged development in the neighborhood as well as the evolution of popular architectural styles popular during this period. The neighborhood developed in waves, from the 1880s on the north side of the neighborhood, to 1915 on the south side. Many of the homes on the south end of the area are architect-designed dwellings. In other areas of Squier Park, builders constructed multiple adjacent homes with the same basic design and slight variations. The most common architectural styles represented in Squier Park are the Prairie School and Craftsman, with numerous examples of the Kansas City Shirtwaist variant. There are also examples of Folk Victorian dwellings as well as historical revival styles, including Colonial Revival, Classical Revival, and Tudor Revival. Other unique dwellings exhibit the Shingle and International Styles. Squier Park's heyday The original owners of Squier Park homes were upper-middle class citizens of Kansas City. They were attorneys, successful entrepreneurs, presidents, vice-presidents, and managers of various companies from automobiles and jewelry to lumber and iron. There were numerous high-ranking officials in the railroad industry. Others worked in more creative fields as artists and architects. Two notable residents of the neighborhood at this time were Michael Katz, co-owner of Katz Drug Store, and former baseball player Johnny Kling. Many early neighborhood residents were also members of the Beth Shalom Synagogue, located at 34th and Troost. Decline and redevelopment The Great Depression began a period of decline for Squier Park. Many of the large houses in the neighborhood were converted into rooming houses or were simply left vacant. After World War II, flight to the suburbs sent Kansas City's population into a steep decline. The population center of the city moved south and east, away from Squier Park, and Troost Avenue became a dividing line in the city. Around the same time, several Catholic groups, including the Benadictine Sisters of Mt. St. Scholastica and the Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity purchased property in Squier Park. The presence of these organizations helped solidify the neighborhood during a time of local urban disinvestment, and continue to be active members of the Squier Park community. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw a revival of many of Kansas City's midtown neighborhoods, including Squier Park. Today Today, Squier Park has matured into a vibrant and active neighborhood. Its motto is \\"Pride, Preservation, Participation.\\"http://www.squierparkkc.org Led by the Squier Park Neighborhood Association, the neighborhood hosts a number of events each year, including an Easter Egg Hunt, Fall Festival, and Homes Tour. In addition, the SPNA funds improvement projects in the neighborhood, including planting and landscaping, and monthly clean-up days. Their neighborhood meetings are open to all residents. On April 24, 2012, the Squier Park neighborhood was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is only the second residential district east of Troost Avenue to receive the designation.

The son of Pasquale Barbaro (born in 1897), Rosario Barbaro, became the head of the Rosi 'ndrina. From his son Domenico (born in 1900) descended Francesco Barbaro, called Ciccio 'u Castanu. It was his son Antonio (born in 1920) who gave birth to the Nigru branch of the cosca, while through the marriages of his daughters Elisabetta and Serafina the 'ndrine Perre Maistru and Papalia Carciutu developed. Three of the eight sons of Serafina Barbaro and Giuseppe Papalia (born in 1907) would leave for Milan to become the bosses of Lombardy: Domenico Papalia, Rocco Papalia and Antonio Papalia.

History The district is named after two Lynchburg judges named William Daniel. The senior inherited the plantation surrounding Point of Honor through his wife, who was a descendant of the plantation's founder, George Cabell, who built Point of Honor in the Federal Style popular in 1815. After his death in 1839, it was inherited by his son, also a prominent judge, William Daniel, Jr., who served on the Virginia Court of Appeal, now known as the Virginia Supreme Court. Judge Daniel subdivided the plantation in the mid-1840s, around the time that his wife died giving birth to their daughter and about three years after the birth of their son, John Warwick Daniel. Young John was raised by his maternal grandparents and sent to boarding schools, as his father remarried (to Elizabeth Cabell) and built a new mansion nearby, Rivermont. After a few tenants, the President of the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad, Robert L. Owen Sr. acquired Point of Honor, where he lived with his family, including his wife Narcissa Owen and son, the future U.S. Senator Robert L. Owen Jr., before selling the property in 1872 and moving to Norfolk, Virginia where he died unexpectedly young. Other stately mansions were built north of Point of Honor on Cabell Street, which followed the ridge of long Daniels Hill, beginning in the 1850s. Three large tobacco warehouses stood at the foot of the hill, with housing for workers on side streets and below the hillcrest (where managers and professionals lived). After the Civil War, they were part of the Lynchburg Tobacco Works and a tin and sheet iron foundry which employed many in the neighborhood. Rivermont was partially subdivided by Edward S. Hutter in 1873 and worker housing lots promoted as \\"Danieltown\\" around the time a new bridge was built across Blackwater Creek for easier access to the city. Foundry owner Albert Gallatin Dabney purchased land from Judge Daniel in 1848 and built 405 Cabell Street by 1852-53. However, it became known as \\"Dabney's Folly\\" because creditors forced him to sell the newly completed building in 1856. It was acquired by the Adams family in 1882, by which time Lynchburg's prosperity returned after the American Civil War, and they restored and expanded it. Local architect Robert C. Burkholder built his own home at 203 Cabell Street, and designed several other Victorian structures which remain in the district. Local architect Carrington Hubbard designed the mansion at 214 Cabell Street for the President of what had become the Glamorgan Factory Ironworks, McWane. Other mansions are in the Georgian, Queen Anne and Italianate styles. Although the district had few commercial businesses, it did have small churches, including C Street Baptist on Hancock Street, First Christian Church (in a house at 305 Cabell Street in 1874) and Third Street Presbyterian Church on Cabell and G Streets (built 1875). Christ Episcopal Church was built as a mission church in 1876, and in 1900 sold and converted into a neighborhood grocery.NRIS p. 22 of 27 Geography The district stretches along the prow of a narrow, elongated hill bordered by the James River on the east and Blackwater Creek on the west. This hill has very steeply sloped sides and is located immediately to the northeast of central Lynchburg. It incorporates about 21 blocks in which are located approximately 180 buildings, virtually all houses ranging in date from the early 19th century through the early 20th century. Architectural styles range from the Federal to the Georgian Revival with a large quantity of urban vernacular dwellings. Stretched out along Cabell Street, the district's only thoroughfare, is a series of outstanding, architecturally sophisticated mansions mostly dating from the last half of the 19th century, including Point of Honor. and Accompanying photo and Accompanying map It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

The early versions of Windows required an existing compatible version of DOS operating system in order to be installed. The Windows NT family, from 3.1 through 6.0 featured text-based installation that prompted users to a GUI wizard in the final steps. The 9x family installer was similar to NT despite it being MS-DOS-based. Additionally, it did not need preinstalled DOS as a requirement. With the release of Windows NT 6.0 (Vista), Microsoft introduced a fully graphical setup environment and UEFI support (partial in Windows Vista and 7, full UEFI support on Windows 8 onwards) after dropping MS-DOS backward compatibility from Windows. Windows 1.x and Windows 2.x The installation of Windows 1.x, Windows 2.0, Windows 2.1x requires that a compatible version of MS-DOS is installed. The user must specify any hardware such as mice or printers during installation. After the installation, Windows was to be started either manually by typing \\"WIN.COM\\" at the command prompt, or configured for automatic startup by adding WIN.COM to the end of AUTOEXEC.BAT. Windows 3.x The installation of Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1x and Windows 3.2 requires that a compatible DOS operating system is already installed. The installer attempts to detect network cards, mice, and other hardware on its own but will rely on the user to specify hardware if it cannot find them. After the installation, Windows was to be started either manually by typing \\"WIN.COM\\" at the command prompt, or configured for automatic startup by adding WIN.COM to the end of AUTOEXEC.BAT.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/82731 Windows 9x Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me do not require MS-DOS. The first phase of setup prepares the hard disk partition for use by Windows by formatting it to a compatible file system, then runs scandisk, and, if the hard disk appears to be ready for installation in terms of free space and disk integrity, then it will copy files to the selected installation folder (typically C:\\\\WINDOWS). The first phase of setup resembles the interface of Windows 3.x. Once this phase is finished, the computer reboots and setup resumes from the hard disk, but still requires the installation media to continue copying files and drivers. At this point the user will be asked to provide a product key. Windows NTBefore Windows Vista= The setup process introduced with Windows NT 3.1 remained in effect until the release of Windows Vista. The general process is: * The user inserts the installation media, initiates the process, and Setup loads various hardware and file-system drivers. ** If any third-party drivers are needed in order to detect an SCSI or RAID system, setup pauses and requests the supply of a driver on a floppy disk. See F6 disk. * The user is then presented with a text-based interface which gives three options 1) install Windows, 2) repair an existing installation, or 3) quit setup.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/103939 * If the user decides to install Windows, he/she is presented with an agreement that they must accept before Setup will continue. Prior to Windows 2000, the user was required to scroll to the bottom of the agreement before they were permitted to agree. * The user must create or select a partition, then a filesystem (either NTFS or FAT). If either of these file systems is already present and there is no version of Windows already on the disk, it is also possible to leave the current file system intact. * The hard disk is checked for errors and space requirements, then, if it passes the check, Windows will be installed. * After the text-based phase of Setup is finished, the computer reboots and starts a graphical phase of setup from the hard disk, prompting the user to reinsert the installation media, to enter the product key, and then it continues copying files and drivers. All versions of Windows NT up to Windows Server 2003, except for Windows XP Home Edition, prompt the user to enter an Administrator password. On Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the Recovery Console is included to repair damaged installations. It allows the user to repair disk and boot record errors, and copy missing or corrupted files to the destination folders. =After Windows Vista= Windows Vista and subsequent operating systems all utilize Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) as the installation environment. Windows PE features a graphical user interface with mouse support from the beginning, rather than requiring a text-only phase as in previous versions. The concept of F6 disks has been improved to provide support for computers without floppy drives; the loading of drivers from CD-ROMs and USB flash drives is now supported. Support for installing Windows onto FAT partitions has been dropped; Windows must be installed onto an NTFS partition.http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926069 =Windows 8= Windows 8 introduces a new secondary installer known as the Upgrade Assistant, replacing Windows Setup for upgrade installations. Designed to be simpler and faster than previous installation methods, it analyses the system's hardware and software for compatibility with Windows 8, allows the user to purchase, download, and install the operating system, and migrate files and settings from the previous Windows installation in the case of a clean install. Windows Setup is still used when booting from installation media.

He was subsequently divorced by his wife, and his two children were raised by their politician grandfather. Leavitt's two children became the subject of a heated custody battle chronicled in the newspapers of the day. Early life and career William Homer Leavitt was born in Scituate, Massachusetts, to Aaron Littlefield Leavitt and his wife Sarah (Clark) Leavitt. The family subsequently removed in 1880 to Newport, Rhode Island, where William Homer Leavitt, having studied art in Paris, returned and set himself up as a society portrait painter. He was much in demand, and among the many well-known figures he painted was United States General Joseph Wheeler, who after the portrait session lent Leavitt his black horse, Alabama. The horse bucked and threw Leavitt onto Newport's Bellevue Avenue.Newport Artist Injured, The New York Times, September 11, 1901 Initially Leavitt was not expected to recover, although he did later make a full recovery.The News of Newport, The New York Times, September 12, 1901 Two years later Leavitt's career had taken off, causing The New York Times to note that \\"artist Leavitt has won distinction in his work and has a host of friends in intellectual circles.\\" That same year, 1903, Leavitt went west to Lincoln, Nebraska, to paint the portrait of attorney and Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan.Making Waves: Female Activists in Twentieth-century Florida, Jack E.

Bryan opposed the match, because of the difference in ages of the couple, as well as the fact that Ruth had just begun college.Everywhere, An American Magazine of World-Wide Interest, Edited by Will Carleton, New York, 1908 The couple married, in a small civil ceremony - described by the newspapers as 'informal' - attended by Bryan's parents, the members of Miss Bryan's college sorority and the widow of the college president and minister who had married William Jennings Bryan and his wife. William Leavitt's mother traveled to Nebraska from Rhode Island for the wedding, which was held in the Bryan home at Lincoln. \\"In accordance with Miss Bryan's wishes and those of her parents,\\" noted The Oswego Daily Times, \\"the wedding appointments will be void of any attempt at elaboration.\\"The Oswego Daily Times, October 3, 1903 Marital life and dissolution Exhibition advertisement for Leavitt's The Last Supper, 1911 Following the abbreviated ceremony, painter Leavitt and his wife departed for the East Coast and the South, and briefly to Europe where they honeymooned. Later the couple settled at their home at 81 Pelham Street in Newport, Rhode Island, where Leavitt set himself up in a studio devoted to his portraiture. But the union was apparently rocky from the start, and within six years Leavitt had departed for Paris to paint, and his wife sued for divorce on the grounds of non- support.Bryan's Daughter Sues for Divorce, The New York Times, January 23, 1909By the time of the divorce filing, the couple had lived separately for two years. During that time, the gifted Ruth Bryan Leavitt was filing stories as a journalist, including one story entitled In Damascus with Ruth Bryan Leavitt which appeared in the Illustrated Sunday Magazine of the Daily Picayune, New Orleans, La., on October 11, 1908. She also took to the campaign trail during her father's third Presidential campaign in 1908 to act as his traveling secretary. During the time of the two-year separation, in 1908, The New York Times reported on a bizarre break-in at the couple's former joint home in Denver, where the home was ransacked and its contents destroyed. William Jennings Bryan, a devout Presbyterian, was said to have opposed the divorce on religious grounds. Nevertheless, in 1909 Bryan's daughter's petition for divorce based on non-support was granted. Following the divorce, Ruth Bryan Leavitt (as she continued to be known) often filled her father's shoes in his speaking engagements.Daughter in Bryan's Place, July 11, 1909 The couple had two children, Ruth and Bryan Leavitt, who were favorites of grandfather William Jennings Bryan. At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, in 1908, newspapers carried photos of Bryan's two grandchildren, and noted that the candidate \\"was never happier than when bouncing on his knees Ruth and Bryan Leavitt.\\"The Oswego Daily Times Following the divorce, Bryan assumed custody of the grandchildren. The following year, Ruth Bryan Leavitt married Major Reginald A. Owen, a British Army officer, whom she met while studying voice in Germany. Following his ex-wife's remarriage, painter Leavitt told reporters that the nuptials - and his ex-wife's presence overseas with her husband - meant that Leavitt would make an attempt to gain custody of his two children.

M. Kerrigan (\\"Shawn Keogh\\"), in The Playboy of the Western World, Plymouth Theatre, Boston, 1911. The play was attacked for replaying the insulting stereotype of the drunken, boasting, belligerent Irishman. Bringing Up Father. Stage Irish or Paddywhackery is a stereotyped portrayal of Irish people once common in plays.stage Irishman, The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature, Oxford University Press, p.534-5. The term refers to an exaggerated or caricatured portrayal of supposed Irish characteristics in speech and behaviour. The stage Irishman was generally \\"garrulous, boastful, unreliable, hard-drinking, belligerent (though cowardly) and chronically impecunious.\\" This caricature includes many cultural outlets, including the stage, Punch cartoons and English language cliché, such as the terms \\"Paddywagon\\" and \\"hooligan.\\" Collectively, this phenomenon is called \\"Paddywhackery.\\" The early stage Irish persona arose in England in the context of the war between the Jacobites and Whig supporters of William of Orange at the end of the 17th century. Later, the stage Irish persona become more comic and less threatening. Irish writers also used the persona in a satirical way. Early examples The character of Teg in Robert Howard's play Committee (1662) has been claimed to be the first example of the type. \\"There the Irish servant makes a show of false naïvety in order to outwit the Parliamentarians beleaguering his Royalist master\\". Captain Macmorris in Henry V by William Shakespeare is a memorable character. His line \\"What ish my nation?\\" was later appropriated by modern Irish writers, becoming a \\"recurrent epigraph\\".However, Macmorris is a loyal and valiant supporter of Henry V, quite different from later, generally lower-class, stage Irishmen. Ben Johnson's The Irish Masque at Court (29 December 1613; printed 1616) is another early example of the conventions. James Farewell's poem The Irish Hudibras (1689) was published in the wake of William's invasion of Ireland to suppress the Jacobite uprising. It is considered to be the principal origin of the stereotype. This takes the form of a parody of book VI of Virgil's Aeneid, in which Aeneas descends into the underworld. In the poem, this is replaced by Fingal in County Dublin, in which Irish costume, behaviour, and speech-patterns are parodied as if they were denizens of Hades. A companion piece, Hesperi-Neso-Grapica or A Description of the Western Isle by \\"W.M.\\" was published in 1715. Pamphlets published under the title \\"Bog witticisms\\" also parodied the supposed illogicality and stupidity of the Irish. 18th–20th century Irish characters appeared in a number of plays during the 18th century. These were not all negative stereotypes. Sometimes the Irishman could be a noble, or at least sympathetic character. In others he could outwit others. Thomas Sheridan's play Captain O'Blunder is about a naive Irishman who in the end triumphs over his English enemy. Lucius O'Trigger in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Rivals is an excessively quick-tempered individual. The character had to be rewritten because of complaints that it was insultingly anti-Irish. All these characters were from the genteel social classes. By the 19th century, the stage Irishman became more of a lower-class stereotype, associated with the emigrations of mid-century. Dion Boucicault's successful plays The Colleen Bawn (1860) and The Shaughraun (1874) included several Stage Irish characters. Patriotic inversions of the stereotype appeared in Ireland and it was commented upon by writers such as George Bernard Shaw in John Bull's Other Island and by John Millington Synge in The Playboy of the Western World. The latter play was condemned by Irish nationalists, including Sinn Féin leader Arthur Griffith, who described the play as \\"a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language we have ever listened to from a public platform\\", and that it insulted Irish men and women.

Known as Kadiramalai in the ancient period, the area served as a famous emporium city and capital of Tamil kingdoms in the Jaffna peninsula of North Eastern Ceylon from classical antiquity. The notable ancient Buddhist monastery referred as Kadurugoda Vihara is situated in Kandarodai. Located near a world-famous port at that time, Kandarodai was the first site the Archaeology Department in Sri Lanka excavated in the Jaffna peninsula.  Etymology  According to Jaffna tradition was this place initially known as Kadiramalai. According to C. Rasanayagam is the Sinhalese name Kadurugoḍa derived from Kadiragoda, which is according to him derived from Kadiramalai, substituting the Tamil suffix malai (meaning \\"mountain\\") with the Sinhalese suffix goḍa. The prefix Kadira is the Tamil name for the Acacia chundra tree. The modern Tamil name Kantarōṭai is believed to be re-derived from the Kadiragoda term. The Tamil name was Kadiramalai. Some scholars holds that Kadurugoda is derived from the Sinhalese name Kandavurugoda (a site of a military encampment). The Portuguese archives refer to this place as Kandarcudde. The name Kadurogoda viharaya is mentioned in the 15th century Sinhalese text Nampota.  History  In 1970, the University of Pennsylvania museum team excavated a ceramic sequence remarkably similar to that of Arikamedu in Tamil Nadu, with a Pre-rouletted ware period, subdivided into an earlier \\"Megalithic\\", a later \\"Pre-rouletted ware phase,\\" followed by a \\"Rouletted ware period\\". Tentatively assigned to the fourth century BCE, radio carbon dating later confirmed an outer date of the ceramics and Megalithic cultural commencement in Kandarodai to 1300 BCE.(Begley,V. 1973) During this excavation, the university team discovered a potsherd carrying a Sinhalese Prakrit inscription written in Brahmi scripts. Further excavations were conducted at the site by the University of Jaffna. Black and red ware Kanterodai potsherd with Tamil Brahmiscripts from 300 BCE excavated with Roman coins, early Pandyan coins, early Chera Dynasty coins from the emporium Karur punch-marked with images of the Hindu Goddess Lakshmi from 500 BCE, punch-marked coins called Puranas from 6th-5th century BCE India, and copper kohl sticks similar to those used by the Egyptians found in Uchhapannai, Kandarodai indicate active transoceanic maritime trade between ancient Jaffna Tamils and other continental kingdoms in the prehistoric period. The parallel third century BCE discoveries of Manthai, Anaikoddai and Vallipuram detail the arrival of a megalithic culture in Jaffna long before the Buddhist-Christian era and the emergence of rudimentary settlements that continued into early historic times marked by urbanization.S. Krishnarajah (2004). University of Jaffna Some scholars have identified Kourola mentioned by 2nd century AD Greek geographer Ptolemy and Kamara mentioned by the 1st century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as being Kadiramalai. The earliest people of Jaffna were belonging to a megalithic culture akin to the South Indian megalithic culture. The period of Buddhism in the Jaffna Peninsula differ from the rest of the island, which is seen as an overlapping of the megalithic beliefs with Buddhism. According to scholars was Kantarodai, known in Tamil literature as Kadiramalai, the capital of the ancient Tamil Kingdom ruled by Tamil speaking Naga kings from 7th century AD to 10th century AD. The Yalpana Vaipava Malai also describes Kadiramalai as the seat of Ukkirasinghan who fell in love with a Chola princess in the ancient period. The ancient Kadurugoda Vihara Buddhist monastery is situated at this site where a 10th century pillar inscription of Sinhalese language recording a regal proclamation of the bequest of gifts and benefits to a Buddhist place of worship was found. Kandarodai was a Buddhist mercantile centre among Tamils. The domes were reconstructed atop the flat bases of the ruins by the Archaeology Department. The similarities between the finds of ancient Jaffna and Tamil Nadu are indicators of a continuous cultural exchange between the two regions from classical antiquity.Man and environment (2002). Indian Society for Prehistoric and Quaternary Studies. Volume 27, Issue 2. pp. 27 These structures built over burials demonstrate the integration of Buddhism with Megalithism, a hallmark of Tamil Buddhism. Outside Andhra Pradesh in India, Kanterodai is perhaps the only site where such burials are seen. Education Kandarodai has a number of education institutions notably Kantharodai Tamil Kandaiya Vidyasalai and Skandavarodaya College.

The initial aim of the league was to curb the power of the Southern Pacific Company in California politics. Some specific elements of their appeal for reform were a direct primary system; the voter initiative, referendum, and recall; \\"the regulation of public utilities; the conservation of forests; the outlawing of child labor, prostitution, and gambling; hospital and prison reform; women's suffrage; and a minimum wage law for working women; the direct election of United States senators; the systemization of public finance; charter reform; public transportation.\\" Starr, Kevin, Inventing the Dream California Through the Progressive Era, Oxford University Press (1985), p. 236 Notes Category:American activists Category:Republican Party (United States) organizations Category:Progressive Era in the United States Category:Political organizations based in the United States ","title":"Lincoln–Roosevelt League"},{"id":"20858813","text":"Emil Løvlien (22 September 1899 - 4 June 1973) was a Norwegian forest worker, trade unionist and politician from Løten. He represented the Labour Party until the split in 1923, and the Communist Party thereafter. He was the chairman of the Communist Party from 1946 to 1965, and served three terms in the Parliament of Norway. Pre-war life and career Emil Løvlien was born in Løiten as the son of smallholder Herman Løvlien (1858–1941) and his wife Oline (1857–1932).. Retrieved on 28 December 2008. He was the younger brother of Ole H. Løvlien. Emil Løvlien attended secondary modern school from 1913, but left in 1914 to become a forest worker. In 1918 Løvlien joined the local branch of the trade union, Norwegian Union of Forestry and Land Workers. He also became involved in politics, and was selected as a member of the board of the local chapter of the Labour Party. In 1922 Løvlien was selected to the national board of the Union of Forestry and Land Workers. He was elected to serve in Løten municipal council, but left the board of the Labour Party chapter, only to return in 1923 as a board member of the local Communist Party chapter. The Communist Party had split from the Labour Party in 1923, due to the latter's unwillingness to accept the Twenty-one Conditions, leading to exclusion from the Comintern. The next year, in 1924, Løvlien left the national board of the Union of Forestry and Land Workers, but began a two-year stint as board member of the Communist Party in Hedmark. Løvlien stood for parliamentary election in 1930 and 1933, but unsuccessfully. In 1931, he was again elected to the municipal council. He was re-elected in 1934, and in the same year he became the party secretary of the Communist Party nationwide. Due to this position, he was also a member of the party's central committee, and served as a member of the board of the party newspaper Arbeideren from 1934. From 1936 he was also a member of the party politburo. He left all positions in 1940, the year that Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany, and the Communist Party declared illegal. Post-war career In 1945, at the first elections after the liberation of Norway from German occupation, Løvlien was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Hedmark. He was a member of the Standing Committee of Finance and Customs and the Election Committee, served as Vice President of the Odelsting and as a representative to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He also took over as party chairman of the Communist Party, in 1946. Løvlien was not re-elected to Parliament in 1949, but returned in 1953 and 1957 to serve two more terms. During both these terms he continued as a member of the Standing Committee of Finance and Customs and the Election Committee. He stood for re-election in 1961, but lost out to Karen Grønn-Hagen of the Centre Party. The margin was extremely small by Norwegian standards; only 16 votes. As such Løvlien was the last member of parliament to be elected from the Communist Party ticket (Reidar T. Larsen was elected in 1973, but as a part of the Socialist Electoral League). Løvlien stepped down as chairman of the Communist Party in 1965. He continued as a member of Løten municipal council until his death. His brother Ole Løvlien became mayor.

The Manor is situated 2 miles north of junction 4A of the M3 between Farnborough and Yateley in Hampshire, England and is situated in of grounds. History The current manor house was built in the French style by Henry Clutton between 1858 and 1860 for Raikes Currie, a partner in Glyn Mills' Bank and a member of the Currie family who benefited substantially from slavery in the British West Indies. During the next three years attention turned to the estate, with the creation of formal gardens around the house and a kitchen garden. The remainder was landscaped as pleasure gardens by F W Meyer, working with the horticulturists Veitch & Sons of Exeter. On Raikes' death in 1881, his son Bertram Wodehouse Currie continued the development, employing Messrs Veitch to lay out a Winter Garden and extensions to the pleasure gardens, which included Hawley Lake, in the 1880s. The house was the birthplace of the British diplomat Sir Reginald Hoare in 1882. Raikes' grandson Laurence Currie built a water tower, created a new complex of walled gardens and further extended the ornamental planting and woodland. The property passed to the War Office in 1934, initially for the Senior Wing of the nearby Staff College, Camberley. It was used by the Royal Engineers, from 1971, as a brigade headquarters and then, from 1990, as an officers' mess for units at Gibraltar Barracks, which are located on the opposite side of the A327 Minley Road. One of the main features is a 600-metre Wellingtonia tree avenue, which was shown off to good effect in the 1969 movie Mosquito Squadron, where the manor house played the part of a French château used as a prisoner of war camp and factory for the V-1 flying bomb. The manor was also used as a location in the 2007 Victorian fantasy movie Stardust, starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. In 2013, as part of the RSME-PPP project, the Holdfast consortium built a new officers' mess on the Gibraltar Barracks site. The Ministry of Defence part- funded this project from sale of the manor which was sold to an international investor in November 2014.

Burkhart works primarily in the tween fiction genre, and is the writer of the Canterwood Crest series of novels. Personal life and education During her childhood, Jessica Burkhart took an interest in equestrianism, and later developed a fondness for writing. Her freelance work was eventually featured in a number of magazines, including The Writer. She began college at age 16 and graduated in 2007 with a BA in English from Florida State University. In 2006, she completed a manuscript as part of National Novel Writing Month. While browsing Burkhart's blog, a literary agent learned of the novel and offered to read it, which eventually led her to sign the author. Afterward, Burkhart's novel, Take the Reins, went through a series of revisions before being put on submission. In May 2007, she signed a four- book deal with Simon & Schuster. As a result, Take the Reins became the first novel in the Canterwood Crest series—a story about disparate schoolgirls engaged in equestrian competitions at an academy. Throughout 2008, Burkhart worked on additional books in the series while helping to promote the first one online, largely through blogging and vlogging. The Canterwood Crest series was later extended. In 2010, she announced plans to write in the young adult genre under her own surname, while maintaining her work in middle-grade fiction. It was announced in late 2013, Burkhart would be writing another middle-grade series, West Coast Prep. The series follows another set of characters at a riding school in California, and was self-published as eBooks. Burkhart announced plans to continue the Canterwood Crest series with approximately 20 e-novellas.

Originally the site of the Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, a large portion of the property is now home to the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant as well as other industries.  History  The Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant (VAAP) operated as a TNT (trinitrotoluene) manufacturing facility from 1942 to 1977 and supported a fertilizer production facility from 1962 to 1982. =1942-1952= The United States Army Corps of Engineers built the original facilities to supply ammunition for Allied Forces during World War II. Initial operation began in July 1942 with the Hercules Powder Company of Wilmington Delaware as the operating contractor. Sixteen TNT batch process lines and associated nitric and sulfuric acid facilities operated until August 1945. Approximately 823 million pounds of TNT were produced for WWII at VAAP (IT Corp 1994). From January 1946 to the spring of 1952, VAAP was officially on standby status and operated and maintained by the government (USATHAMA 1978; Army 2003). =1952-1957= VAAP was reactivated in 1952 for the Korean War, and operated by the Atlas Chemical Industries of Wilmington Delaware until 1957. Approximately 283 million lbs of TNT were produced for the Korean War (IT Corp 1994). During this period the first Army studies were undertaken to examine methods of pollution control but VAAP was put on standby status before pollution strategies could be implemented (IT Corp 1994). =1957-1965= VAAP was on standby status from 1957 until 1965 when it was reactivated for the Vietnam War (Army 2003a; IT Corp 1994). Between the Korean and Vietnam Wars there was considerable residential development north of VAAP and adjacent to the Chickamauga Lake (IT Corp 1994). From March 1957 to December 1964 the plant was under the protective surveillance of Atlas Chemical Industries; and in December 1964 until September 1965 protective surveillance was passed onto Farmers Chemical Association Inc. (subsequently known as CF Industries, Incorporated [CFI]). In September 1965 a new contract with Atlas was entered into with the Army (SI 1994). On January 6, 1972, Atlas merged into ICI America Incorporated (ICIA), and is currently called ICI Americas, Inc. (Army 2003a; USATHAMA 1978). In 1961, the government leased the \\"CFI Lease Area,\\" an area along the western border of VAAP, to CFI (Bonds 1985). Previously the area had been used for nitric and sulfuric acid production (Army 2003a). In 1962, CFI used the existing acid facilities and built an ammonia plant on the 824-acre lease area to produce ammonium nitrate fertilizer, urea, and related products (Army 2003a). In 1963 a urea plant was put into operation, thereby doubling CFI's production capacity (IT Corp 1994). =1965-1977= In 1965, VAAP was reactivated and ten TNT batch process lines were used to produce TNT for the Vietnam War (IT Corp 1994). Additionally, upon reactivation, the Army decreased the number of acres in the original CFI lease area and took over the operation of some of the acid production equipment to increase nitric acid production and sulfuric acid concentration capacity. Therefore, in 1966, CFI constructed a new acid plant adjacent to the ammonia plant, and operated the existing acid plant in the lease area for the Army (Bonds 1985; Army 2003a). In February 1969, as VAAP began to upgrade facilities, the batch processing lines began to decrease (Report 123, 1978; Army 2003a). From July 1971 to 1975, six new CIL continuous process lines were built in an area where four old batch process lines were previously razed (Army 2003a). Lines 1, 2, and 3 were modernized by May 1974, and a contract for modernizing Lines 4, 5, and 6 was awarded in June 1974. However, from November 1974 to March 1977, only one of the six Canadian Industries Limited (CIL) lines was operated because plant operations ceased before the other five became operational (IT Corp 1994; USATHAMA 1978). In June 1970, the Army began to build the New Acid Area. The area included a Direct Strong Nitric (DSN) Acid Facility, an Ammonia Oxidation Process (AOP) Nitric Acid Facility, and Sulfuric Acid Regeneration (SAR) Facilities (used for oleum production) (IT Corp 1994; USATHAMA 1978). In 1972, a carbon dioxide plant was constructed at the CFI Lease Area and an industrial waste water system was built to treat and recycle ammonium nitrate wastewater (IT Corp 1994; USATHAMA 1978). By January 1975, all batch process lines stopped and, in 1977, TNT production at VAAP ceased altogether and the plant was placed on inactive status (Army 2003a). A total of 1,765 million lbs of TNT were produced for the Vietnam War (IT Corp 1994). =1980s= CFI produced commercial ammonium nitrate at the CFI Lease Area until 1982. From 1982 to 1985 the CFI Lease Area was inactive, and the CFI facilities were ultimately dismantled for salvage between 1985 and 1986 (IT Corp 1994). The Army acid facilities in the southern area were dismantled during the 1950s and 1960s. The northern acid facilities were dismantled by approximately 1997 (Army 2003a, IT Corp 1995, Public Comment 2004b). =1990s= During the 1990s, VAAP operated the burning ground to treat materials contaminated with TNT or TNT waste materials generated while VAAP was operational (EPA 2003a; IT Corp 1994, Public Comment 2004b) On September 5, 1995, approximately $5 million was awarded to ICIA to reactivate and modify one of the TNT lines at VAAP for production of commercial TNT. The contract was awarded under the Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support Act of 1992, and the work was to be complete by July 31, 1996 (DOD 1995). This work was never completed and the ICIA contract expired on December 31, 1998. Tecumseh Professional Associates became the new contracting operator, however, the project remained and remains inactive.  Redevelopment and conversion to civilian uses  In the 1990s, portions of the site began to be opened up to civilian purposes. Hickory Valley Road was constructed through the facility, connecting SR 58 with SR 317. The Hamilton County Schools executed a lease on the old administration buildings at VAAP, renovating the facilities for their central office. Additional efforts to restore the site for industrial used were made. In 2006 the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) constructed an interchange on nearby Interstate 75 and a connector road into the park. In July 2008, Volkswagen announced plans to locate an assembly plant in the park. The plant began operations in April 2011. An additional of land on the east side of the park was opened to the public as the Enterprise South Nature Park. The park opened to the public in December 2010.Hamilton County Parks and Recreation Employee The park is for passive uses, including bicycling and walking. The land where the nature park is located was originally used for storing explosives manufactured at the VAAP, and most of the storage bunkers still remain. On October 14, 2010 it was announced that CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway would again serve the site following the completion of a $6.6 million project to provide dual rail service to the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant.

It is approximately east of Colombo. During the period of British rule it was called Karunkodithivu. History During the period of British rule, Akkaraipattu was within the Batticaloa District. A Government Agent headed each district. The posts of Maniyakkara (Assistant Government Agent) and Vanniyanar (Additional Government Agent) reported to the Government Agent.. The Vanniyanar appointed two officers directly responsible for irrigation, development, and education. Under this structure, agriculture and road construction became a prominent part of the development of the Akkaraipattu area. The Vanniyanar was also responsible for appointing the Chairman and members of local government organizations who would then conduct the functions of a local council including collecting taxes, civic construction, and maintaining law and order. The construction of the Gal Oya scheme, which commenced in 1949 and continues to be improved upon, further established agriculture—particularly paddy and sugar cane—as a driving economic force. Road development also continued in parallel with the development of land for agriculture. The Urban Development Area of Akkaraipattu includes Akkaraipattu Municipal Council and includes 23 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GND) of Akkaraipattu Municipal Council and five GNDs from the Pradeshiya Sabha area.

The three main soil types in this area are: alluvial soil which has variable drainage and texture, reddish-brown soil, and Solonetz soil. The alluvial soil is generally found on flat flood plains. Poorly drained alluvial soil is grey in colour whilst soil with better drainage is coloured brown to yellowish brown. The reddish brown soil has a reddish-brown surface colour when dry and turns to a dark reddish-brown colour when wet. Solonetz soil is not a fertile soil because it has a pH value greater than 8.5. =Hydrology= Akkaraipattu has three major water tanks: Ilukkuchchenai Tank, Neethai Tank, and Thillai Aru. These tanks, combined with water catchment systems, assist in supporting the paddy cultivation in the area. =Climate= Akkaraipattu is located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The northeast monsoon period (October–February) has the highest monthly rainfall. Conversely, the dry season months of June, July, and August have the lowest rainfall. The seasonal rain provides for the cultivation of crops during the maha season. The average annual rainfall is .

A longtime minister of the Associate Presbyterian Church, Boyd had been the pastor of the Associate Presbyterian congregation in Stafford since 1900, but he came to hold Reformed Presbyterian views and took much of his church with him into the RPCNA.Thompson, Owen F.

Although the bridge is in serviceable condition, it is only open to foot traffic. Bergstresser/Dietz Covered Bridge Data on the Historical Marker Database  Location  The Bergstresser/Dietz Bridge is located adjacent to the intersection of Ashbrook Road and Washington Street in Canal Winchester. The bridge crosses Little Walnut Creek at what has been termed Kramer's Ford. An Ohio Historical Marker commemorating the bridge is located at the corner of Ashbrook Road and Washington Street.  History  In the 1800s, the village of Canal Winchester was important to the local economies of southeastern Franklin and northwestern Fairfield counties. The village evolved into a local transportation hub because the Ohio and Erie Canal and the Hocking Valley Railway passed through. Village of Canal Winchester Web Site Canal Winchester Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, Ohio Canal Winchester Historical Society Little Walnut Creek acted as a moderate barrier to local farmers who transported crops into town. As a result, local citizens petitioned for a bridge to be built over Little Walnut Creek. In March 1887, the Franklin County Commissioners announced the building of a bridge over Little Walnut Creek at Kramer's Ford. Michael Corbett of Groveport, Ohio, contracted to construct the abutments and the Columbus Bridge Company built the covered bridge for $2,690.00. Reuben Partridge, company vice president, supervised the building, using his patented truss system consisting of double and triple truss members constructed of pine and oak. In the 1930s, the road traveling over the bridge became State Route 674 and in the 1950s the road was redirected to bypass the covered bridge.  Preservation  In 1990, the county contracted with Abba Lichtenstein & Associates to evaluate the condition of the bridge. The W.J. Seidensticker Company repaired and restored the Bergstresser/Dietz Bridge using original and new materials. The bridge was rededicated on September 1, 1991.

Founded in 2003, Tender delivers educational violence prevention programmes to secondary schools, Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) and youth centres throughout Greater London.  Mission  Tender promotes healthy relationships based on equality and respect by inviting all men, women and especially young people to actively prevent domestic abuse and sexual violence. Tender aims to: # enable young people (5 to 25 years old) to develop positive attitudes towards relationships in order to prevent domestic abuse and sexual violence # equip adults with the skills and resources they need to promote healthy relationships amongst young people  History  Tender was formerly known as Until the Violence Stops (UTVS), the UK arm of the V-Day campaign. Tender's main work is the TRUST Education Project. TRUST was developed out of the work of Tender's founding director and education manager that was commissioned by the South Essex Rape and Incest Crisis Centre (SERICC) to design a peer education theatre project for the Thurrock RESPECT programme in 2000. RESPECT, created by Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust, has been running since, working to prevent violence in relationships by educating young people about the early warning signs of abuse. Tender adapted and developed the RESPECT model to work in London schools. With the funding of The Body Shop Foundation, the TRUST Education Project was piloted in April 2004 in 5 secondary schools in the London boroughs: Lambeth, Lewisham, Hammersmith, Newham, and Westminster. The TRUST Education Project has been delivered to 27 boroughs in London since its conception. CRG Research Limited are currently conducting an independent evaluation of the Trust Education Project.  About the Trust Education Project  The TRUST Education Project aims to enable young men and young women to develop healthy relationships based on respect, trust and equality and to be active citizens in creating communities that do not tolerate domestic abuse and sexual violence. The objective of the project is to change attitudes of tolerance to violence by using drama to explore issues around healthy and unhealthy relationships. Young people create a piece of theatre that represents their understanding and outlook while also educating and informing their audience, peers and local communities. In a 10-week workshop process, students explore issues around respect within relationships, good citizenship and positive communication skills.

The billboard depicts a traditionally dressed Aymara woman holding pen and paper and saying \\"I study law.\\" The main text reads, \\"Exercising my sexual and reproductive rights has permitted me to become a professional.\\" It cites Article 66 of the 2009 Bolivian constitution. Abortion in Bolivia is illegal, except in the cases of rape, incest, or to protect the woman's health. This policy forms part of the Penal Code laid down in 1973, and has been in force since then. Due to the difficulty of receiving abortions - even if the abortion does fall under one of the exceptions to the law, judicial permission needs to be secured, which can take a very long time - many pregnant women end up having unsafe, clandestine abortions instead. According to the Bolivian Ministry of Health, almost all of the 67,000 abortions performed in Bolivia in 2011 were clandestine, with approximately half of the women who received them needing hospital care afterwards. This practice has been linked to the high maternal mortality rates in the country. Efforts were made to change the law in 2005, when legislators from the Movement for Socialism introduced a bill to legalise abortion, but it was quickly rejected. In 2013, four years after the introduction of Bolivia's new constitution, Patricia Mancilla began a legal challenge calling for the Plurinational Constitutional Court to declare many provisions of the Penal Code, including the anti-abortion legislation, unconstitutional. On 6 December 2017, Bolivia's National Assembly voted to decriminalize abortion before eight weeks of pregnancy for \\"students, adolescents, or girls\\". Although the legislation does not specify an age limit, it is considered to apply to girls of age 17 or lower. Health Minister Ariana Campero supported this legislation as a measure to reduce the maternal mortality rate, and President Evo Morales signed the reform into law on December 15, 2017. However, the reform law was repealed in its entirety on January 27, 2018, in response to protests about its provisions criminalizing medical malpractice.

He is a theologian, author, preacher, churchman, and adjunct professor of New Testament at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Taylors, South Carolina. Formerly, he was the founding Dean and Professor of New Testament at Knox Theological Seminary. Prior to his appointment at Knox Theological Seminary, he taught New Testament and New Testament Greek at Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. As a pastor, he planted Covenant Presbyterian Church in Naples, Florida and has served numerous other local churches in the Presbyterian Church in America and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. A former president of the Evangelical Theological Society, he has also taught and preached the Bible at many other seminaries and churches around the world. He has authored several works, most notably The Pastoral EpistlesThe Pastoral Epistles: A Commentary on the Greek Text. George W. Knight III. 1999. William. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan. and a short commentary of Timothy and Titus as included in the Baker Commentary on the Bible.Baker Commentary on the Bible. Water A. Elwell, editor. 2000. Baker Books, Grand Rapids, Michigan. He received his theological doctorate from Free University of Amsterdam in 1968.http://www.bible-researcher.com/knight1.html Dr. Knight was a member of the General Assembly-appointed Ad Interim Committee to study the number of ordained offices in the Presbyterian Church in America according to Scripture. His Ad Interim Report of the Number of Offices by George W. Knight III was incorporated into the polity of the Presbyterian Church in America. He also served on an ad interim committee to study the issue of marriage, divorce and remarriage, which brought about the 1992 publication of a Position Paper of the Presbyterian Church in America on Remarriage and Divorce, 1992.. In 1977, he argued in a book about gender roles that the role relationship of men and women is theologically analogous to the subordination of the Son to the Father in the Trinity. Australian theologian Kevin Giles has more recently responded that complementarians have \\"reinvented\\" the doctrine of the Trinity to support their views of men and women, suggesting that some complementarians have adopted a heretical view of the Trinity similar to Arianism. Knight released a response to \\"evangelical feminists\\" in a 2009 book. Knight's contributions to the complementarian view of the role relationship of men and women, and especially as it is applied to the issue of the ordination of women to the ministry, have greatly influenced the founding of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, where he continues to serve as a council member.

At his memorial, the President of Lehigh University described him as \\"one of the most remarkable cases of versatility that our country has ever seen—sailor, soldier, engineer, lawyer, orator, editor, novelist, story-teller, poet, biblical critic, theologian, teacher, chess- player—he was superior in each capacity. What he did, he always did well.\\"  Early years  Rossiter W. Raymond was of English descent. His earliest American ancestor on the paternal side, Richard Raymond, emigrated from England to this country and settled at Salem, Massachusetts, in 1632. On his mother's side, he was descended from well-known New England families. His great-grandfather, Nathaniel Raymond, was an officer in the Continental Army; and his grandfather, Caleb Pratt, served in the War of 1812. His father, Robert Raikes Raymond This source gives 1839 as the year Robert Raikes Raymond graduated from Union College.

His mother (born 1818, died 1891) was a native of Providence, Rhode Island. They were married at Columbus, Ohio, in 1839. Rossiter was the eldest of a family of seven children, of whom four were sons and three daughters. He received his early education in the common schools of Syracuse, New York, where his parents participated in the underground railroad, and in 1857 entered the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, of which his uncle, John H. Raymond (later president of Vassar College), was then president. Raymond graduated from that institution at the head of his class in 1858. Having attended college at the Royal Mining Academy, Freiberg, Saxony, the University of Heidelberg and the University of Munich, 1858-1861, Rossiter would start his post graduate career serving as aide-de-camp, with the rank of captain, on the staff of John C. Frémont, by whom, during his Civil War campaign in the Valley of Virginia, he was officially commended for gallant and meritorious conduct.  Working years  Following the American Civil War, he entered private practice for several years, forming the partnership of Adelberg and Raymond in 1864 in New York City. Besides consulting work, the firm also aided a number of later prominent German-educated mining engineers begin their careers, until Justus Adelberg's death on June 5, 1869, a result of mercury inhalation. In 1867, Raymond started a 23-year career as editor of the American Journal of Mining, soon renamed the Engineering and Mining Journal, the longest-running mining periodical in the United States (it is still publishing). As editor, Raymond became one of the most influential voices in American mining. He used his editorial platform to expose poorly and crookedly run mining companies, and under his leadership the Engineering and Mining Journal became a major force for honesty in the mining industry.Dan Plazak, A Hole in the Ground waith a Liar at the Top (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2005) 64, 134-135, 140. His work at the E&MJ; led, in 1868, to Raymond's appointment to the coveted position of United States Commissioner of Mines to gather mining statistics on the American West. In 1869, Raymond hired Anton Eilers as Deputy Commissioner and, together and apart, the two explored the entire Far West, becoming national experts on the mining industry and creating large annual reports for Congress. These eight reports, for the years of his office, 1868-1875, contain a wealth of historic information about the mining West during this important period, especially the California Mother Lode, the Comstock Lode of Nevada, and the Rocky Mountains camps of Colorado. See, for example, the published version of the 1869 report. In the 1860s as well, he helped form the short-lived American Mining Bureau, a forerunner of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. An original member of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, he had, at first, the \\"Engineering & Mining Journal\\" serve as its official member publication, and published many of the AIME technical reports prior to publication in its Transactions. He served as one AIME's first vice-presidents in 1871, and again in 1876, and 1877, was president from 1872 to 1875, and long-term secretary from 1884 to 1911. His New York City office became the unofficial center for the mining engineering fraternity. As secretary he also edited 40 of the annual volumes of Transactions, to which he liberally contributed essays, especially pertaining to the Federal mining laws, as well as other articles of importance. In 1945, the institute created the Rossiter W. Raymond Memorial Award after him, to recognize the best paper written each year by an author under 33 years of age. He was a long-time supporter of Brooklyn's Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims, and was the director of its Sunday school for 50 years. His role in the church was so influential that he was asked to take over for Henry Ward Beecher when Beecher died. He would also play an important role during the Beecher-Tildon scandal. From 1870 to 1872, he was the professor of ore deposits at Lafayette College, which in 1868 had conferred on him an honorary doctorate. He was the United States Commissioner to the Vienna Exposition. In 1871, he was a part of the a six-member party that entered what is now Yellowstone National Park, running into the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 in the process. Raymond's party is officially known as the first group of visitors to enter a National Park, though it technically wasn't a national park at the time. Rossiter recorded the visit in his 1880 book Camp and Cabin. The visit was also recorded by Calvin C. Clawson, a reporter for the New Northwest Newspaper. Pictures were taken by August F. Thrasher who, according to Mary C. H. Williams, carried negative plates and photos of the Yellowstone journey as far east as Indiana where the trail grows cold. In 1885, he was the New York State Commissioner of Electrical Subways. Rossiter consulted for Cooper, Hewitt & Company for some twenty plus years, and then Hewitt's and Cooper's American Sulphur Company in 1890. In 1911, during a visit to Japan as members and guests of the American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME), Raymond received from the Mikado the distinction of Chevalier of the Order of the Rising Sun, fourth class—the highest ever given to foreigners not of royal blood—' \\"for eminent services to the mining industry of Japan\\". These services consisted in advice and assistance rendered in America to Japanese engineers, students, and officials throughout a period of more than 25 years. Legal scholar Rossiter left an enduring mark on the jurisprudence of mining law. He defined the 'law of the apex' and gave the term 'lode' a definition that not only swayed the decision in Eureka-Richmond lawsuit, but also influenced all later mining litigation. He was even invited to address the United States Supreme Court on a point of mining law, which the Court accepted based on its subsequent decision. Raymond had not been a lawyer when he testified before the Supreme Court, but in 1898 he was admitted to the bar in both the state and federal courts. In 1903, he was appointed lecturer on mining law at Columbia University. In June 1906, Lehigh University granted Rossiter the first Doctorate of Laws ever granted by the institution. Author Raymond was the author of a large number of poems, stories, newspaper articles, biographies, memorials, opinions, fiction and non-fiction books. Unfortunately, most of his original work was destroyed by a fire late in his life; however, this comprehensive list shows the enormous breadth of his writing. = 'Death is Only an Horizon' = Despite the large body of work he produced, the opinions he expressed, and the stories he told, he is best known, at least on the internet, for the latter half of a poem titled 'Death is Only an Horizon': > Life is eternal; and love is immortal; and death is only a horizon; and a > horizon is nothing save the limit of our > sight.http://death.findyourfate.com/death-quotes.htm A few sites also credit an extended version to him: O God, who holdest all souls in life; and callest them unto thee as seemeth best: we give them back, dear God, to thee who gavest them to us. But as thou didst not lose them in the giving, so we do not lose them by their return. For not as the world giveth, givest thou, O Lord of souls: that which thou givest thou takest not away: for life is eternal, and love is immortal, and death is only the horizon, and the horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight.http://www.wccm.org/images/PDF/VV9Lettersmall.pdf These words were later adapted into the song \\"Life is Eternal\\" by Carly Simon, and frequently appear among quotations on the subject of life, death, and sympathy.http://www.quotegarden.com/sympathy.html HOWEVER, crediting Mr. Raymond as the author of this quote appears to be an error, because the quote \\"Life is eternal, and love is immortal, and death is only an horizon, and an horizon is nothing save the limit of our site\\" was written almost 200 years before Rossiter Raymond was born. These words, and many others in Raymond's poem \\"Death is Only an Horizon\\" are first recorded in a prayer written by William Penn (1644-1718). This prayer is cited in the NSW Council of Churches Selected Christian Prayers, PR0061. Fr. Bede Jarrett, O.P. also lists this prayer as a prayer of his, but he credits \\"prayer written by William Penn, 1644-1718\\". The prayer written by William Penn and documented by the two places listed is as follows: \\" We give them back to thee, dear Lord, who gavest them to us. Yet as thou didst not lose them in giving, so we have not lost them by their return. What thou gavest thou takest not away, O Lover of souls; for what is thine is ours also if we are thine. And life is eternal and love is immortal, and death is only an horizon, and an horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight. Lift us up, strong Son of God, that we may see further; cleanse our eyes that we may see more clearly; and draw us closer to thyself that we may know ourselves to be nearer to our loved ones who are with thee. And while thou dost prepare for us, prepare us also for that happy place, that where they are and thou art, we too may be for evermore.\\"It appears that many of the lines of this prayer are included in Raymond's poem \\"Death is Only an Horizon.\\" In contrast, other than references on the internet, no definitive work or reference by Raymond has come to light that includes his version of the poem. =List of Governmental Reports to Congress= # [1st] 1868, 40th Cong., 3d sess., House ex. doc. no. 54. # [2d] 1869, 41st Cong., 2d sess., House ex. doc. no. 207. # [3d] 1870, 42d Cong., 1st sess., House ex. doc. no. 10. # [4th], 1871, 42d Cong., 2d sess., House ex. doc. no. 211. # [5th], 1872, 42d Cong., 3d sess., House ex. doc. no. 210. # [6th], 1873, 43d Cong., 1st sess., House ex. doc. no. 141. # [7th], 1874, 43d Cong., 2d sess., House ex. doc. no. 177. # [8th], 1875, 44th Cong., 1st sess., House ex. doc. no. 159. =Partial list of books= # 'Die Leibgarde' (1863), a German translation of 'The Story of the Guard' by Mrs. Jessie Fremont (1863); # 'The Children's Week' (1871); # 'Brave Hearts' (1873); # 'The Man in the Moon and Other People' (1874); # 'The Book of Job' (1878); # 'The Merry-go- Round' (1880); # 'Camp and Cabin' (1880); # 'A Glossary of Mining and Metallurgical Terms' (1881); # 'Memorial of Alexander Mining Law' (1883–95); # 'Two Ghosts and Other Christmas Stories' (1887); # 'Tales of Three Corners (1890); # 'The Life of Peter Cooper' (1897); ReferencesExternal links * Rossiter W.

The series follows young student Sasha Silver as she enters Canterwood Crest Academy, an elite school housing highly competitive equestrian riders. While attending Canterwood, Sasha encounters a disparate collection of students, including the snobbish alpha rider, Heather Fox, and eventual love interest named Jacob. As events transpire, the team members attempt to work together amidst a slew of personality clashes and romantic conflicts. In the later books, the series switches focus to new characters Drew Adams and Lauren Towers. Overview Former Connecticut student Sasha Silver plans to join the school's equestrian team. However, she is met with resistance from three popular members known as the \\"Trio\\" (Heather, Julia, and Alison), who view her as a threat to their social status. Internal conflict sets the stage for the story, with the initial focus being Sasha's efforts to make the team and sustain her morale and good academics. In the midst of things, Jacob begins to earn her romantic attention. But eventually starts a fight with her best friend Callie that changes everything However, other romantic interests also enter the story, leading to love triangles and other personal matters. Background Burkhart was inspired by a combination of equestrian experience during her youth and a fondness for writing as she grew older. After much of her freelance work was published by numerous magazines, she entered 2006's National Novel Writing Month and completed a first draft of Take the Reins. In January 2007, a literary agent offered to read the story after viewing the author's blog. Burkhart was later signed by the agent, which eventually led to a four-book deal with Simon & Schuster. While promoting the first novel, Burkhart maintained an online presence throughout 2008, blogging and vlogging with regard to the production of her work and the publishing process. In April, the author reported that photoshoots for her covers had been set in motion. By September, Burkhart had received an advance reader copy of Take the Reins while working on the subsequent novels. In December, it was announced that an additional four novels would gradually follow the fourth book, Triple Fault. Later in the month, an online video trailer for Take the Reins was released, featuring photos of scenery and the character models. Trailers for other releases followed.

Traditional narrative According to tradition, he was born at Trani in the 2nd century, the son of a man named Apollonius. He became a shepherd at an early age to support the family; he had a small flock of sheep and donated his earnings to the poor. He and his father were baptized by Bishop Redemptus of Trani. When Redemptus died, Magnus was proclaimed bishop of Trani by the people and local clerics.Monks of Ramsgate. “Magnus of Anagni”. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 15 November 2014 As bishop Magnus worked to spread Christianity in Fondi, Aquino, and Anagni. In Anagni, he baptized a young woman named Secundina, who would later die as a Christian martyr. Magnus fled to Rome to escape the persecutions of Christians that were led by a man named Tarquinius. After a while, Magnus headed home, hiding himself along the way. Soldiers discovered him in a cave near Fondi, however, and he was decapitated near Fabrateria Vetus, in Latium. Veneration In the ninth century, his relics were translated from Fondi to Veroli by a man named Plato. According to tradition, a Muslim overlord named Musa converted Magnus' sepulcher into a stable. When the horses placed in the stable began to die, Musa became frightened and sold the relics to citizens from Anagni. These relics were translated to the cathedral of Anagni in the presence of Bishop Zacharias (Zaccaria). In June 1901, the Right Reverend Monsignor Mezzolinski, secretary to Cardinal Mieczysław Halka Ledóchowski, wrote to the pastor of St. Martin of Tours, Monsignor Francis Zabler: \\"At last I can fulfill your wish. The venerable Cistercian Nuns of Agnani, Italy, must give up their sanctuary and relinquish their monastery and seek another house. In their sad plight, Pope Leo XIII has given them permission to donate the relics of certain martyrs under certain conditions. I myself have been at Agnani to investigate the authenticity of these relics. Without a doubt they are genuine.\\"Spoekler, p.26 On December 31, 1901, the complete skeletal relics of St. Magnus, a Roman centurion Magnus of Anagni arrived at the Louisville customs office. They were placed in glass reliquaries beneath the north and south transept altars, where they have been venerated ever since.Spoelker p.26 Magnus was afterwards declared patron saint of Anagni, and was also venerated in the town of Colle San Magno, in Frosinone. Magnus should not be confused with Saint Magnus of Cuneo, martyr of the Theban Legion, who is venerated on the same day. The Roman Martyrology lists only Saint Magnus of Anagni. He is mentioned in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum in which his death place is listed as Fabrateria vetus. Magnus enjoyed wide veneration in the lower Latium region. His name appears in the Sacramentarium Gelasianum (7th century) and the Sacramentarium of the eighth century.  References Sources *Spoekler, Rev.

Bush administration's President's Surveillance Program (PSP).NSA Inspector General report on the President's Surveillance Program, March 24, 2009, page 10, note 3. The National Security Agency (NSA) program was approved by President Bush shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks and was revealed by Thomas Tamm to The New York Times in 2004.\\"Is the FBI Up to the Job 10 Years After 9/11?\\" April 28, 2011 Stellar Wind was a prelude to new legal structures that allowed President Bush and President Barack Obama to reproduce each of those programs and expand their reach.  Program scope  The program's activities involved data mining of a large database of the communications of American citizens, including e-mail communications, telephone conversations, financial transactions, and internet activity. William Binney, a retired technical leader with the NSA, discussed some of the architectural and operational elements of the program at the 2012 Chaos Communication Congress. The intelligence community also was able to obtain from the U.S. Treasury Department suspicious activity reports, or \\"SARS\\", which are reports of activities such as large cash transactions that are submitted by financial institutions under anti-money laundering rules. There were internal disputes within the U.S. Justice Department about the legality of the program, because data is collected for large numbers of people, not just the subjects of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. Alt URL During the Bush Administration, the Stellar Wind cases were referred to by FBI agents as \\"pizza cases\\" because many seemingly suspicious cases turned out to be food takeout orders. According to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller, approximately 99% of the cases led nowhere, but \\"it's that other 1% that we've got to be concerned about\\".  2004 conflict  From a report by the inspectors general of six US intelligence agencies that was declassified in September 2015, it became clear that President Bush had originally authorized the collection of telephone and e-mail metadata only if one end of the communications was foreign or when there was a link to terrorism. But in 2004, the Justice Department found out that the NSA was apparently also collecting the metadata of purely domestic communications, after which President Bush declared that NSA had always been allowed to do so, but that analysts were only allowed to look at metadata related to terrorism. With this revised formulation, Bush reauthorized the program on March 11, 2004. In 2004, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), Jack Landman Goldsmith, wrote at least two legal memos authorizing the program, \\"We conclude only that when the nation has been thrust into an armed conflict by a foreign attack on the United States and the president determines in his role as commander in chief ... that it is essential for defense against a further foreign attack to use the [wiretapping] capabilities of the [National Security Agency] within the United States, he has inherent constitutional authority\\" to order warrantless wiretapping—\\"an authority that Congress cannot curtail,\\" Goldsmith wrote in a 108-page memo dated May 6, 2004. In March 2004, the OLC concluded the e-mail program was not legal, and then-Acting Attorney General James Comey refused to reauthorize it.  Revelations  In March 2012 Wired magazine published \\"The NSA Is Building the Country's Biggest Spy Center (Watch What You Say)\\" talking about a vast new NSA facility in Utah and said, \\"For the first time, a former NSA official has gone on the record to describe the program, codenamed Stellarwind, in detail,\\" naming the official William Binney, a former NSA code breaker. Binney went on to say that the NSA had highly secured rooms that tap into major switches, and satellite communications at both AT&T; and Verizon. The article suggested that the supposedly-terminated Stellar Wind continues as an active program. This conclusion was supported by the exposure of Room 641A in AT&T;'s operations center in San Francisco in 2006. In June 2013 the Washington Post and the Guardian published an Office of the Inspector General (OIG) draft report, dated March 2009, leaked by Edward Snowden detailing the Stellar Wind program. No doubt remained about the continuing nature of the surveillance program. In September 2014 The New York Times asserted, \\"Questions persist after the release of a newly declassified version of a legal memo approving the National Security Agency's Stellarwind program, a set of warrantless surveillance and data collection activities secretly authorized after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\\" as an introductory headline summary with a link. The accompanying article addressed the release of a newly declassified version of the May 2004 memo.Savage, Charlie, \\"Redactions in U.S. Memo Leave Doubts on Data Surveillance Program\\", The New York Times, Sunday, September 7, 2014, p. A17 Note was made that the bulk of the program—the telephone, internet, and e-mail surveillance of American citizens—remained secret until the revelations by Edward Snowden, that to date, significant portions of the memo remain redacted in the newly released version, and that doubts and questions about its legality persist.

SMC primarily signs and distributes established hip hop artists. SMC grew out of a vision that Saroj Thapa had in 2013 to launch a new kind of record label, one based in his hometown, that would be about hip hop music. Saroj crossed paths with Micheal Luna and Charles Vasquez, and SMC came one step closer to being realized. An ambitious Bay Area-bred music fan and aficionado, Bronson was covering East Texas's colorful hip hop scene for a fledgling urban music magazine called Showcase at the time. Saroj hired him as his partner and in the A&R; position. His instincts were right—the first release brought in and shepherded by Bronson was Ya Boy's first cousins, Bay Area hip-hop artists San Quinn and Messy Marv. At one point, Bizzy Bone of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony was signed to SMC. The recruitment of Tashjian's fellow industry icon George Nauful to steer the company's business affairs and financial sectors completed the foundation.

According to the Claremont Profile Method it represents textual family Kx in Luke 1 and Luke 20. In Luke 10 no profile was made. It creates cluster 46. According to Gregory its text often agrees with Minuscule 52 and 61.  History  The manuscript was dated by Scholz to the 15th, by Scrivener to the 11th century and by Gregory to 12th century. Currently it has been assigned by the INTF to the 13th century. The date of the codex is estimated between 1296 and 1318. The manuscript once belonged to Micheal Zorianos, to Francesco Barozzi (hence name of the codex). It was examined by Mill (as Bodl. 2) and Griesbach.

According to several ancient geographers, they shared an island with two other legendary races: the Panotti and Oeonae. Pliny the Elder's Natural History locates this island near the Scythian coast ; Pomponius Mela's De situ orbis places it in or around the North Sea, mentioning it alongside Denmark and the Orkney Islands (Mela iii. § 56). Adam of Bremen wrote in the 11th century that the Scritofinni could run faster than wild animals. Olaus Magnus addresses this in his work Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus where he explains that the Scritofinni gets their name from the jumping motion they perform while hunting on skis. The same connection can also be seen in Abraham Ortelius's map Europam, Sive Celticam Veterem from 1595 where he places Hippopodes and Scricofinni in the same area of northern Scandinavia. The Travels of Sir John Mandeville places the Hippopodes in Maritime Southeast Asia, and adds that they are particularly fleet-footed and hunt by running down their prey. A 2014 multispectral imaging project led by Chet van Duzer revealed that a c.1491 map created by Henricus Martellus Germanus and likely used by Christopher Columbus located the Hippopodes in Central Asia.

Fordham currently hosts Ben Fordham Live on Sydney radio station 2GB and is host of television program Australian Ninja Warrior. Career Fordham began his career on Sydney's 2UE radio station, for which he won a Walkley Award for his coverage of the 1997 Thredbo landslide. In 1998, Fordham moved to television and joined Sky News Australia as a reporter and presenter. After less than a year at Sky News, Fordham joined the Nine Network, working on tabloid current affair and news programs including 60 Minutes, A Current Affair, Nine News and Today. Fordham filled in for Stuart Bocking on 2UE Nights in the 2008/09 summer period and also filled in for Ray Hadley on 2GB in the 2009/10 summer period.

He also joined 2GB in January 2011, replacing Jason Morrison on the programme Sydney Live (since renamed Ben Fordham Live). In March 2014, Fordham announced that he would be leaving Today at the end of the year to concentrate on his radio career. Since moving into his radio position, he has served as a fill-in presenter on Today and Nine News. In 2016, Fordham was announced as co-host of Australian Ninja Warrior alongside Rebecca Maddern on the Nine Network. In 2018, Fordham was also made an inaugural board member of the Ash Williams Show Podcast, alongside other media personalities such as Ed Kavalee, Sonia Kruger and Tony Martin. Fordham was also instrumental in securing the support of Scott Pape as a permanent board member.https://twitter.com/ashwilliams1/status/989422331712843776 In May 2020, 2GB announced that Fordham would replace Alan Jones, who was retiring from radio. Fordham finished hosting his drive show on 22 May 2020 and began his new role on 1 June 2020. His breakfast show took the same name as his drive show: Ben Fordham Live. Personal life When Fordham was seven years of age, he was diagnosed with epilepsy after suffering a seizure. He did work experience at a radio station as a teenager while a student at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, a Catholic college in Lane Cove. He is managed by the Fordham Company, which was run by his late father, John. In October 2011, Fordham married Seven News presenter Jodie Speers. In August 2014, Fordham announced on Today that his wife was pregnant with their first child; their son was born later that year. In April 2016, Fordham announced on radio that Speers was pregnant with their second child. She gave birth to a daughter later that year. In September 2019, Fordham announced that Speers gave birth to their third child. Legal issues On 26 February 2009, Fordham was charged with concealing a serious crime and breaching the Listening Devices Act. The Nine Network and A Current Affair producer Andrew Byrne were also charged. On 20 July 2010, NSW Supreme Court judge Elizabeth Fullerton called Fordham's attitude \\"disrespectful\\" when he failed to appear in court to hear her judgement on the charges of breaching the Listening Devices Act. Justice Fullerton found him guilty of one of four charges against him, that he knowingly recorded a conversation on 28 May 2008. Byrne was convicted of four charges of breaching the act. The conversation was aired on ACA in May 2008, claiming to show former Waverley mayor James Markham ordering a fatal hit on a male escort. Although found guilty, Fordham and Byrne each escaped conviction, with Justice Fullerton saying it was \\"an appalling lack of judgment by two senior journalists who are otherwise held in esteem by their colleagues\\".

Rep. 1 (1933), Valuation Docket No. 387: Illinois Central Railroad Company et al. and existed in the late 19th century. History The original proposal for the railroad was for a 243-mile route from Danville through Hume to the Ohio River. The portion running through Hume was completed and put into service in 1881. The north-south railroad was known by the following official and unofficial names: * Kansas and Sidell * K & S * Old Dody * Dog River * Crab Oyster * Chicago & Ohio River * C & O As the roadbed decayed, the line carried freight at just nine-and-a-half miles per hour. Derailments were frequent nonetheless. I.N. Coolley served as President of the railroad in its later years. The rolling stock of the railroad consisted of one caboose and two locomotives, numbered 200 and 201, which were former switch engines purchased from the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad. Cars were rented from major railroads. In 1886, the company was sold at foreclosure and acquired by the Chicago and Ohio River Railroad, a predecessor of the Illinois Central Railroad. However, when that company's successor, the Peoria, Decatur and Evansville Railway, went bankrupt, the line was resold in 1898 to the Indiana, Decatur and Western Railway, a predecessor of the Cincinnati, Indianapolis and Western Railroad (acquired by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1927). In 1938, the line was abandoned by legal means. The scrap iron was removed by Hyman Michaels. George H.

It is now part of Bet Alfa Synagogue National Park and managed by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.Beit Alfa Synagogue National Parks Website, 500px Excavations The Beth Alpha synagogue was uncovered in 1928 by members of the nearby Kibbutz Hefzibah, who stumbled upon the synagogue's extensive mosaic floors during irrigation construction. Excavations began in 1929 under the auspices of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and were led by Israeli archaeologist, Eleazar Sukenik. A secondary round of excavations, sponsored by the Israel Antiquities Authority in 1962, further explored the residential structures surrounding the synagogue. In addition, a hoard of 36 Byzantine coins were found in a shallow depression in the floor apse. Architecture Architectural remains from the Beth Alpha synagogue indicate that the synagogue once stood as two-story basilical building and contained a courtyard, vestibule, and prayer hall.Hachlili, Jewish Art and Archaeology in Late-Antiquity, 232–33 The first floor of the prayer hall consisted of a central nave measuring 5.4 meters wide, the apse, which served as the resting place for the Torah Ark, the bimah, the raised platform upon which the Torah would have been read, and benches.Hachlili, Jewish Art and Archaeology, 182. The Torah Ark within the apse was aligned southwest, in the direction of Jerusalem. Dedicatory inscriptions Dedicatory Inscriptions The northern entryway features two dedicatory inscriptions in Aramaic and Greek. Although partially destroyed, the Aramaic inscription indicates that the synagogue was built during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinus, probably Justin I (518–527 CE), and was funded by communal donations.Avigad, \\"Beth Alpha\\", Encyclopaedia Judaica, 192.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 43–46. The Greek inscription thanks artisans \\"Marianos and his son Hanina\\", who were also listed as the artisans of the nearby Beth Shean synagogue.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 47. The inscriptions are flanked on either side by a lion and a buffalo, who serve as the synagogue's symbolic guardians.Sukenik, The Ancient Synagogue of Beth Alpha, 42. Nave mosaicsNorthern panel—Binding of Isaac= Binding of Isaac The northern panel depicts the \\"Binding of Isaac\\" (Genesis 22: 1–18). To the right, Abraham is depicted dangling Isaac over the fiery altar as he raises his hand to perform the sacrifice. In the center, God, symbolized by the small fire- encircled hand appearing in the upper center, instructs Abraham to sacrifice a nearby ram instead of Isaac. The hand of God is aptly labeled with \\"al tishlah\\" or \\"do not raise\\", taken from God's command to the angel that Abraham not \\"raise his hand against the boy [Isaac]\\" (Genesis 22:12).Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel, 288. Translation taken from the 2003 edition of the Jewish Publication Society Tanakah. In the lower center of the composition, immediately below the hand of God, the ram that served as Isaac's substitute is positioned standing sideways, trapped in the nearby thicket.Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 288. The odd positioning of the ram may perhaps be a convention the artists used to convey the distance that the Bible says separated Abraham and Isaac, from the two servant boys (Genesis 22:5), who accompanied Abraham and Isaac on their journey, and are depicted standing to the left. All the figures in the scene, except for the two servants, are identified with Hebrew labels. The iconographic significance of the \\"Binding of Isaac\\" is unclear. There is a wide variety of opinions, with some scholars seeing this narrative as an affirmation of God's mercy, others as symbolic of his continuing covenant with Israel, and others as embodying the rabbinic notion of \\"zechut avot\\" or the merit of the fathers.For a survey of scholarly opinions see Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 287–292; Fine, Art and Judaism in the Greco Roman World, 194–5. In contemporaneous Christian church art, where the \\"Binding of Isaac\\" was also a popular theme, the narrative was seen as a typological pre-figuration for the crucifixion.Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 291. =Central panel—zodiac wheel= Zodiac Wheel with Hebrew Labels The central panel features a Jewish adaptation of the Greco- Roman zodiac. The zodiac consists of two concentric circles, with the twelve zodiac signs appearing in the outer circle, and Helios, the Greco-Roman sun god, appearing in the inner circle.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 35. The outer circle consists of twelve panels, each of which correspond to one of the twelve months of the year and contain the appropriate Greco-Roman zodiac sign. Female busts symbolizing the four seasons appear in the four corners immediately outside the zodiac.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 38. In the center, Helios appears with his signature Greco-Roman iconographic elements such as the fiery crown of rays adorning his head and the highly stylized quadriga or four-horse-drawn chariot.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 35. The background is decorated with a crescent shaped moon and stars. As in the \\"Binding of Isaac\\" panel, the zodiac symbols and seasonal busts are labeled with their corresponding Hebrew names. This zodiac wheel, along with other similar examples found in contemporaneous synagogues throughout Israel such as Naaran, Susiya, Hamat Tiberias, Huseifa, and Sepphoris, rest at the center of a scholarly debate regarding the relationship between Judaism and general Greco-Roman culture in late- antiquity.Fine, Art and Judaism, 199–202. Some interpret the popularity that the zodiac maintains within synagogue floors as evidence for its Judaization and adaptation into the Jewish calendar and liturgy.For a survey of scholarly views supporting the normative role of the zodiac in Judaism see Fine, Art and Judaism 184–204 and Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 308–9. Many scholars cite the popularity that the zodiac maintains within late-antique and medieval piyyutim and manuscripts as further support for their views regarding the Judaization of the zodiac. Others see it as representing the existence of a \\"non-Rabbinic\\" or a mystical and Hellenized form of Judaism that embraced the astral religion of Greco-Roman culture.Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman World Vol. 8—Astronomical Symbols, 167–195; Magness identifies Helios with the angel, Metatron, see Magness, \\"Heaven on Earth: Helios and the Zodiac Cycle in Ancient Palestinian Synagogues\\", 2, 30–32. =Southern panel—synagogue scene= The southern panel, which was laid before the synagogue's Torah Shrine, is a liturgically oriented scene that emphasizes the centrality of the Torah Shrine. The Torah Shrine stands at the center of the composition and is depicted with a gabled roof. The Torah Shrine is decorated with ornamented panels featuring diamonds and squares.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 34; Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 273. The floating conch shell seen in the center of the roof, is a stylized representation of the Torah Shrine's inset arch.Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 284. A hanging lamp is suspended from the gable of the roof. As a symbolic marker of its importance, the lower register of the Torah Shrine is flanked by two roaring lions and is surrounded by Jewish ritual objects such as the lulav, etrog, shofar, and incense shovel. Two birds flank the gabled roof in the upper register of the Torah Shrine.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 22. Sukenik proposes that the birds are ostriches while Hachlili proposes that the birds are peacocks. Synagogue Scene Two large seven-branched Menorot candelabras stand on either of the Torah shrine. The base and branches of the two Menorot are not identical in form; the right-hand Menorah has an upright base, while the left-hand Menorah has two crescent shaped legs and one upright leg.Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 377. Lastly, the entire scene is framed by the two pulled back curtains, which served to demarcate the sacred space of the Torah Shrine.Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 34; Avigad, \\"Beth Alpha\\", Encyclopaedia Judaica, 191. The presence of the Menorah, which originally stood in the Jerusalem Temple, comes to highlight the continuing importance that the Jerusalem Temple occupied in the development of the synagogue.Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 362. Additionally, the Menorah also maintained a practical function, as the primary light source for the area around the Torah Shrine.Fine, Art and Judaism, 154–55. Sukenik believed that the two Menorot depicted flanking the Torah Shrine in this scene, likely stood adjacent to the Torah Shrine within the actual Beth Alpha synagogue.Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology, 362; Sukenik, Beth Alpha, 17.

The stone, weighing approximately (approximately 1,700,000 carats) originated from Bahia, Brazil and is emerald crystals embedded in host rock. It narrowly escaped flooding during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 during a period of storage in a warehouse in New Orleans. There was an ownership dispute after it was reported stolen in September 2008 from a secured vault in South El Monte in Los Angeles County, California. The emerald was located and the case and ownership has been settled. The stone has been valued at some $400 million, but the true value is unclear. History It originally was mined in 2001, in the beryl mines of north Bahia, Brazil, from which it takes its name. Bahia is an archaic form of Portuguese baía, meaning 'bay' after the bay first seen by European explorers in the 16th century. Location of Bahia state in Brazil. After being moved from Brazil to the United States, various attempts were made to sell it without success. There were conflicting claims of ownership. Eventually, the emerald was seized from a gem dealer in Las Vegas and taken into the custody of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. After a series of legal actions, Judge John A. Kronstadt of the Los Angeles County Superior Court announced in September 2010 that he would hear the case. Anthony Thomas, among the claimants, claimed to have original ownership of the gem including claimants who have paid more than $1.3 million for the emerald. A trial date was set for January 21, 2013, in the Los Angeles County Court. On January 29, 2014, Judge Kronstadt issued a ruling rejecting the claims of Anthony Thomas, leaving the determination of the remaining claimants for a future trial. Mr. Thomas subsequently filed bankruptcy to discharge the costs and attorney fees he incurred in his failed attempt to claim the Bahia Emerald as his own. Mr. Thomas' appeal from the ruling against him was later dismissed because Thomas failed to pursue the appeal in a timely fashion. After a trial on March 30, 2015, in the Los Angeles Superior Court, the Honorable Michael Johnson, the judge who succeeded Judge Kronstadt in the civil case, entered a final order on June 23, 2015 determining and ruling that FM Holdings, LLC was the bona fide purchaser of the Bahia Emerald and that title to the Bahia Emerald is now held solely and exclusively by FM Holdings, LLC by a series of agency relationships and lawful transactions. All other claimants to the Bahia Emerald have either been previously dismissed, e.g., Tony Thomas, or settled their claims leaving FM Holdings, LLC, as the sole and exclusive owner of the Bahia Emerald by Judge Johnson's June 23, 2015, ruling. On June 25, 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, on a request by the Department of Justice, issued a restraining order protecting the stone, arguing that it is subject to forfeiture in Brazil, where prosecutors in an upcoming criminal trial allege that two men knowingly received the stolen emerald and illegally smuggled it out of the country.

Military culture and organization Among the Mapuche, war among themselves was conducted by one lof under its lonko against another, or by an alliance of rehue or aillarehue under a toqui, for the purpose of avenging a real or sorcerous injury, (if restititution was not forthcoming) or for acquiring women and plunder. Leadership However by the time of the arrival of the Inca and later the Spanish, the Mapuche had begun call Butalmapu (assemblies) of their leaders to elect a Toqui to provide a unified command for their armies. In case of such an invasion, or later revolts or wars against the Spanish the instigating Mapuche Ulmen would call a Butalmapu by \\"sending around the Pulquitin\\". This special pulquitin (arrow) was an arrow stained with the blood of llama's heart with knotted red threads indicating the place and date of the Butanmapu to decide whether to go to war and if so what the plan of campaign would be. Sometimes the heads of slain enemies would be sent to these other clans as incentive or gifts to inspire them to join this alliance. The Toqui was chosen in a Butalmapu, of the Lonkos (chiefs) of various Lofs (clans), or Aillarehues (confederations of clans), allied during the war in question. The toqui had the power to enforce obedience of the troops, organize them, and appoint leaders to them. The command position would continue until the war in question ended, or if in an assembly the Lonkos decided the toqui to be incompetent. In the event of death, a new toqui would be appointed. Giovanni Ignazio Molina, The geographical, natural, and civil history of Chili, Volume 2, Chapter III, pp.68-71 The Mapuche were already well organized, upon the arrival of the Spanish colonists. In the previous century they had fought against the expanding Inca Empire and had stopped their invasion at the Battle of the Maule.The history of the Inca campaign in Chile and this battle are known from the Comentarios reales of de Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, Segunda Parte : Libro VII Cap. 18, 19 and 20. These were derived from Inca sources. The Spanish histories of Jerónimo de Vivar, Crónica y relación copiosa y verdadera de los reinos de Chile and Vicente Carvallo y Goyeneche, Descripción Histórico Geografía del Reino de Chile, Tomo I, Capítulo I mention it also. They could in case of invasion, summon large, organized bodies of warriors and from at least the time of Lautaro’s revolt were able to build forts and complex defensive works to defend themselves from the invaders. Tactics After the initial Spanish conquest, beginning with Lautaro, the new toquis included many new tactics in order to fight the invaders. Lautaro had been captured in one of Pedro Valdivia's earliest campaigns in Araucania and as a page to Valdivia learned of the strengths and weaknesses of the Spanish especially their cavalry. After escaping and becoming a leader of the revolt against the Spanish, Lautaro was instrumental in teaching Mapuche warriors, (previously accustomed to infantry battles in the open field), guerrilla tactics and the use of terrain to reduce the effectiveness of the Spanish cavalry. He also was using espionage carried out by the supposedly conquered Mapuche to be informed of the actions of his enemies. He also built and used fortresses as bases during his invasion of Spanish territory in central Chile. By 1553 the Mapuche began to have cavalry of their own thanks to Lautaro and his betrayal of the Spanish, that soon were capable of defeating the Spanish cavalry. By the 1560s the Mapuche began to use camouflaged pits and trenches, captured artillery and firearms. By 1570 they had learned the use of infantry formations, similar to the Spanish Tercio, that allowed them to defeat Spanish cavalry in the open field. After 1600, they mounted their infantry on horses for greater mobility and developed the tactic of the malón. By the 1620s it was usual practice in battle for two thirds of their force to fight mounted as lancers on the wings with foot in the center, similar to the Spanish custom. When retreating from a malón the Mapuche would often tempt their pursuers into a narrow defile where their main body would confront them. If the pursuers fell on this body ambush detachments would fall on their flanks. All these advances proved effective in holding off the Spaniards and Chileans for 350 years.

Designed in the English Tudor Revival style by architect Samuel L. Bartlett, the depot was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The depot is currently home to the Wayzata Historical Society Museum and the Wayzata Area Chamber of Commerce. History The Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad, predecessor of the Great Northern, reached Wayzata on August 24, 1867. The first depot was located at the foot of Broadway Avenue, about three blocks east of the present depot location. At that time the tracks were laid on top of Lake Street, the town's main road. When the railroad was extended westward through the town, local citizens protested because trains would shower the business district with cinders and sparks. The railroad ignored their complaints, but nevertheless influenced the town's economy and identity as it connected local farmers to large, urban markets and made Wayzata a transportation center for Lake Minnetonka's burgeoning tourism industry. During the Panic of 1873, the Saint Paul and Pacific struggled financially. In 1879 it was purchased by James J. Hill and other investors and reorganized as the Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway (StPM&M;). Four years later, the community of Wayzata incorporated as a village. The first act of the Village Council was to ban saloons, and the second was to have the railroad tracks moved away from the downtown business district. An 1883 ordinance required the tracks to be relocated 300 feet (91 m) to the north. Hill, chairman of the StPM&M;, ignored the village's ordinance. The Village Council ultimately filed a lawsuit against the railroad in 1889. Hill argued that he had state law on his side and that, if the town continued its lawsuit, he would move the station nearly a mile east of town. In 1891, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled against the Great Northern, holding that the company was trespassing on village property (Lake Street) with its tracks through the downtown area. As promised, Hill tore down the existing station and moved it to flat land beneath today's Bushaway Road railroad bridge. When the new station received the name Holdridge, Wayzata was literally taken off the map.Plaque posted on site by the City of Wayzata in 2004 A plaque describing the history of the depot By 1905 the Village Council had had enough and voted for a reconciliation ordinance with the railroad, which had been part of Hill's Great Northern Railway since 1890. Hill responded by commissioning the construction of a new depot near Wayzata's downtown business district on the shores of Lake Minnetonka. When it was completed in 1906, the new building was considered the \\"handsomest\\" on the entire Great Northern line. Trains serviced the depot with scheduled stops until 1958, when it became a \\"flag stop\\" serviced by request only. The Great Northern Railway merged with other railroads to form the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1970, only a short time before Amtrak took over US passenger rail service in 1971. When this happened, all passenger service to and from Wayzata was terminated. With no further commercial use in sight, Burlington Northern donated the depot to the city of Wayzata in 1972. The building was later rehabilitated and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Today the depot is shared between the Wayzata Area Chamber of Commerce and the Wayzata Historical Society, which operates a museum inside the former waiting room. The museum was opened in 2001. In the summer, the Museum of Lake Minnetonka operates the historic Minnehaha steamboat from a dock located adjacent to the depot. Architecture The Wayzata Depot was designed by Great Northern architect Samuel L. Bartlett in the English Tudor Revival style of architecture. The structure features a stucco facade and three gabled porticoes with curved half-timbering. Original lead glass windows remain in place. Inside, the depot's waiting room features porcelain tile walls and a terrazzo floor. Original waiting room benches, a freight agent's desk, and freight scales reproduce the experience of checking passengers' luggage on the train. Features such as indoor plumbing and a water fountain, modern by non-urban 1906 standards, are original to the building. The office area houses the Depot Agent's desk, the operator's desk, and various memorabilia. A ticket window connects the office with the waiting room. Located behind the office, the baggage room retains its original wood plank ceiling. Garden railroad display In September 2006 the Minnesota Garden Railroad Society (MGRS) installed a temporary garden railroad display at the depot to help the city of Wayzata celebrate its annual James J. Hill Days. The positive response to this attraction prompted the City of Wayzata, the Wayzata Historical Society, and the MGRS to hold meetings about building a permanent garden railroad layout there. After the City of Wayzata approved the project in 2009, Minnesota received its first public garden railroad display. The MGRS runs G scale model garden trains on weekends.

If the abortion is done without the consent of the woman, the punishment is increased to 2 to 5 years. If the death of the woman occurred as a result of the abortion, the person who did the procedure can be sentenced to 4 to 6 years in prison, and 5 to 10 years in cases in which she did not consent. In Paraguay, 23 out of 100 deaths of young women are the result of illegal abortions. Concerning this death rate, Paraguay has one of the highest in the region. In April 2015, a story about a 10-year-old Paraguayan girl who was 22 weeks pregnant as a result of having allegedly been raped and impregnated by her stepfather came to light.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/14/denied-an- abortion-11-year-old-rape-victim-in-paraguay-gives-birth/ The pregnancy had been discovered that same month upon the girl’s mother having brought her to a local hospital in order to receive medical treatment for abdominal pain, which was found to have been related to the pregnancy. Calls from her mother as well as outraged members of the public throughout the world for permission to allow the girl the ability to undergo an abortion procedure were ultimately denied. The girl had given birth to the child via a caesarean section in a Red Cross hospital in Paraguay’s capital city of Asunción later that year. The girl’s stepfather has since been prosecuted for the rape and her mother had also been charged with negligence for her alleged role in the circumstances surrounding the rape and pregnancy of her daughter. The high-profile nature of this case has led opposition leftist parties to push for less restrictive abortion laws in Paraguay, such as in cases of child pregnancies and in cases of sexual assault.

It introduced the concept of innominate terms, a category between \\"warranties\\" and \\"conditions\\". Under the English sale of goods principles, a condition is a term whose breach entitles the injured party to repudiate the contract,Sale of Goods Act 1979 s 11 but a breach of warranty shall give rise only to damages. Sale of Goods Ac 1979 section 62 In this case, Diplock LJ proposed that some terms could lead either to the right to terminate a contract as a remedy, or to the mere entitlement to damages (without a right to terminate). What mattered was not whether a particular contract term was called a \\"warranty\\" or a \\"condition\\", but how serious was the breach of the term. In short, the test for whether or not one may repudiate has now become, \\"does the breach deny the claimant the main benefit of the contract?\\" However, modern commercial custom has since established that some breaches, such as failure to meet a \\"notice of readiness to load\\" a sea cargo, will always be repudiatory.The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164 Facts Hong Kong Fir Shipping hired out their elderly ship,\\"a 25-year-old vessel called the \\"Antrim\\", which they renamed the \\"Hong Kong Fir\\", of some 5395 tons gross and 3145 tons net register\\" the \\"Hong Kong Fir\\", under a two-year time charter-party to Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha. It was to sail in ballast from Liverpool to collect a cargo at Newport News, Virginia, and then to proceed via Panama to Osaka. A term in the charterparty agreement required the ship to be seaworthy and to be \\"in every way fitted for ordinary cargo service.\\" However the crew were both insufficient in number and incompetent to maintain her old-fashioned machinery; and the chief engineer was a drunkard. On the voyage from Liverpool to Osaka, the engines suffered several breakdowns, and was off-hire for a total of five weeks, undergoing repairs. On arrival at Osaka, a further fifteen weeks of repairs were needed before the ship was seaworthy again. By this time, barely seventeen months of the two-year time-charter remained. Once in Osaka, market freight rates fell, and Kawasaki terminated the contract citing Hong Kong's breach. Hong Kong responded that Kawasaki were now the party in breach for wrongfully repudiating the contract. At first instance, it was held that although the ship was a seaworthy vessel on delivery in Liverpool, Hong Kong Fir had not exercised due diligence to maintain the vessel in an efficient and seaworthy state. However, the trial judge found that this breach was not substantial enough to entitle the charterer to repudiate the contract. Kawasaki appealed. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that the \\"seaworthiness\\" term was not breached in a sufficiently serious way to entitle the charterer to terminate. It was an \\"innominate term\\". Diplock LJ's judgment went as follows: Significance Both under the common law and under the Hague-Visby Rules, the term \\"seaworthiness\\" covers not just the ship itself, but its crew, its provisions and equipment, and its suitability for both the cargo and the voyage. The Hong Kong Fir confirmed that the term \\"seaworthiness\\" has a very broad meaning ranging from trivial defects like a missing life preserver or a major flaw that would sink the ship. Accordingly, it is impossible to determine ahead of time what type of term it is. Thus, the type of breach must be determined by the judges. \\"Seaworthiness\\" is defined both by common law and by statute. In McFadden v Blue Star Lines [1905] 1 KB 607 it was stated that, to be seaworthy, a vessel must have the degree of fitness that an ordinarily careful and prudent shipowner would require his vessel to have at the commencement of a voyage, having regard to all possible circumstances. And the Marine Insurance Act 1906 s 39(4) provides that \\"a ship is deemed to be seaworthy when she is reasonably fit in all respects to encounter the ordinary perils of the adventure insured.\\" In the Hong Kong case, the issue was not whether the unseaworthiness was \\"serious\\" or \\"minor\\"; rather the question was whether the undoubtedly serious unseaworthiness had had an effect sufficiently grave to allow the charterer to repudiate. On the facts, given that the charterer had had the \\"substantial benefit\\" of the contract for some 80% of the time period, the court held that the breach was adequately remedied by damages. The Hong Kong Fir decision was met with some alarm in the shipping world, where certainty is crucial. The problem was the delay element; one had to \\"wait and see\\" the effect of the breach. The enormous costs involved in chartering mean that parties cannot afford to leisurely loiter, whilst pondering the consequences of the breach. Soon after, in The Mihalis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164, it was held the impossibility of the shipowner to meet the \\"expected ready to load\\" date, ipso facto entitled the charterer to repudiate for anticipatory breach of condition.

This abbreviation is used in colloquial English, instead of the whole phrase. It connotes a sexually attractive older woman, typically one who has children. The phrase's usage has gone from relatively obscure to mainstream in the media and entertainment.  History  Linguist Laurel A. Sutton states that MILF was one of 9 different terms for \\"attractive women\\" collected from undergraduates at a large linguistics class at Berkeley in the spring of 1992. Stereotypical users would be \\"college students from East Contra Costa, California\\". The term was widely popularized by the film American Pie (1999), where John Cho's character (simply credited as 'MILF Guy No. 2') used the term to refer to Jennifer Coolidge's character Jeanine Stifler. A 2007 article in New York magazine stated the evidence that the term had become mainstream included \\"25,000-plus MILF-branded mugs and tees on Café Press to a rash of hot-mama books (The Hot Mom's Handbook, Confessions of a Naughty Mommy, The MILF Anthology), television shows (Desperate Housewives, The Real Housewives of Orange County, the forthcoming contest Hottest Mom in America, and a pilot in development called MILF & Cookies), and, of course, a concomitant porn genre\\". Similar terms The term yummy mummy is also used along with MILF. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term as \\"an attractive and stylish young mother\\". Although not yet as widespread in popular culture at large, the forms DILF (for \\"Dad/Daddy I'd Like to Fuck\\") or FILF (for \\"Father I'd Like to Fuck\\") are used among androphiles to refer to a sexually attractive older man who is likely a father.  In popular culture  In 2002, a resident of the U.S. state of Washington applied for a vanity license plate reading \\"GOTMILF\\", a parody of the \\"Got Milk?\\" advertising slogan. This plate was approved, but it was later canceled after complaints were filed against it. In December 2007, low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines ran a controversial advertising campaign, using MILF(s) to promote their tropical destinations, based on a different acronym: \\"Many Islands, Low Fares\\". In January 2009, Spirit ran the campaign again. In 2013, an apparel company, True & Co., parodied the phrase in advertising for its line of brassieres, converting it to \\"Mom I'd Like to Fit\\". The campaign garnered negative attention for the San Francisco-based company. A 2014 article in Playboy magazine by Purdue University sex educator and researcher Justin Lehmiller referenced the work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Kinsey to explain the fascination with the MILF phenomenon. SMILF is an American comedy television series starring, created, written, and directed by Frankie Shaw on Showtime. It is based on Shaw's short film of the same title. The series' name, SMILF, is a play on the term \\"MILF,\\" with the \\"S\\" standing for \\"single\\" or \\"Southie\\" (a nickname for South Boston), or both. The series was cancelled on March 8, 2019 after two seasons. The 2018 French comedy film MILF is about three childhood friends who become MILFs seducing three young men.

They initially specialized in the manufacture of chemicals derived from mercury and bismuth. Over the years they diversified into other chemical fields including photographic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and chemicals for research and development. The company was bought by Établissements Poulenc Frères (later to become Société des Usines Chimiques Rhône-Poulenc) in 1922, and subsequently moved to Dagenham, Essex, although it continued to trade under the May & Baker name. During this time May & Baker branched into pharmaceuticals, with one of their major discoveries being sulphapyridine (M&B; 693) in 1939. This compound was used to treat Winston Churchill's bacterial pneumonia in 1942 — his condition was extremely poor prior to the application of the drug. Post-war, May & Baker expanded into many countries round the world, particularly those in the Commonwealth, and comprised three divisions, Pharmaceuticals, Fine Chemicals and Agrochemicals. The 1960s were a boom time for the company, unofficially known as 'the Brittox Years' after one of its world-leading agrochemicals. There were agrochemical manufacturing sites in Sweet Briar Road, Norwich, Barton Moss in Manchester and Belvedere in Kent, a research station at Ongar in Essex and a head office at Regent House in nearby Brentwood. The Agrochemical Division also contained Environmental Products (amenity horticulture) and Garden Care (retail), the latter being sold to Pan Britannica Industries (Sumitomo Group) in 1991. A subsidiary, Hortichem, was based in Ongar. In 1978, potassium cyanide (KCN) manufactured by May & Baker was used by Jim Jones to kill over 900 people in the Jonestown mass murder- suicide in Guyana. The chemical, purchased under the guise of a laboratory chemical necessary for gold cyanidation, was mixed with grape-flavoured Flavor Aid, Valium, Promethazine, and Chloral hydrate.https://www.aetv.com/real- crime/jonestown-how-did-it-feel-to-die-of-cyanide-poisoning In 1990 the company came under the direct supervision of Rhone-Poulenc, which later merged with Rorer, an American pharmaceutical company, to form Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. In 1999 the company was split — the Dagenham site (now just pharmaceuticals), merged with Hoechst and changed the company name to Aventis, removing R&D; from the site in July 2000. The Norwich site became part of Bayer Agrochemicals. The Nigerian subsidiary, bought out in 2002, remains as May & Baker Nigeria plc. Later on, a further merger with Sanofi-Synthélabo in 2004 changed the Dagenham site owner to Sanofi-Aventis. In 2009 Sanofi-Aventis announced their intention to close the Dagenham plant by 2013. Sanofi's plans to turn the former site into a state-of-the-art science park were put in doubt by a lack of funding from London mayor Boris Johnson's Growth Fund. Club The original works club still exists as The May & Baker Club, and still uses the original M&B; logo made using the old symbol for Mercury, surmounted with a five-pointed star. They also host a football club of the same name.

She was the second daughter of Landgrave (later Prince) William I of Hesse by Princess Wilhelmina Caroline of Denmark and Norway, daughter of King Frederick V. Life Since early childhood, Karoline Amalie was betrothed to her double first-cousin Prince Frederik of Hesse; however, the engagement was dissolved in 1799 after the apparent affair between her and chamberlain Count Ludwig von Taube, who ended when Landgrave William I dismissed him from his service and expelled from court. In the summer of 1801 Karoline Amalie met Hereditary Prince Augustus of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg when he visited the Kassel court. In January 1802 Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, in the name of his son, asked the hand of the princess in marriage. The wedding ceremony took place in her homeland, Kassel, on 24 April of that year. The union remained childless, but Karoline Amalie was a devoted stepmother for her husband's daughter from his first marriage, Princess Louise. Two years later, in 1804, Karoline Amalie became Duchess consort of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg after the death of her father- in-law. The well-known painter Caroline Louise Seidler, who was at the court of Gotha in the winter of 1811 to paint the Ducal family, described Karoline Amalie rather unflattering as \\"good, benevolent, but not just an excellent lady\\". About the relation of the Duchess with her husband August, she also quoted: \\"She loved him enthusiastically, whose spirit astonished her\\".Rosemarie Bartel, Princess Luise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Gotha 2009, p. 23. However, \\"since their mutual points of view about life are completely different\\",Max Berbig, Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, in: The wives of the rulers of the Duchy of Gotha, Gotha, 1890, p. 142. the Ducal couple became estranged after a few years of marriage and Karoline Amalie withdrew herself from court life and the public in general increasingly since 1810. One main reason for this was the enthusiasm of her husband for Napoleon, which the Duchess didn't share -her parents had been forced to flee into exile after the occupation of Hesse-Kassel by the French army in 1806-. After her husband's death in 1822, Karoline Amalie retired to Gotha Winter Palace (in German: Winterpalais) as her widow's seat -for this the residence was renamed by the population in her honour as the Widow's Palace (in German: Witwenpalais)-. The Gotha Winter Palace, by Heinrich Justus Schneider, 1840. Her summer residence, Schloss Friedrichsthal, was where the Dowager Duchess received the Royal British couple (Queen Victoria and Prince Albert) in August 1845 during their visit to Germany. The local Privilegirte Gothaische newspaper wrote on the occasion of this visit: \\"...everyone in Gotha rejoiced of happiness, when the revered noble princess, the widowed Duchess Carolina Amalia received the sublime wife of her beloved grandson, Prince Albert, in her maternal arms\\".Privilegirte Gothaische Newspaper, vol. 154, no. 173, 30 30 August 1845. Prince Albert (youngest son of Karoline Amalie's stepdaughter Louise) was the favorite step-grandson of the Dowager Duchess. From 1822 to 1835, he and his brother Ernest spent several weeks every year in the care of Karoline Amalie in the Winter Palace. Until her death, Albert maintained with her an active correspondence, where he always called her \\"Beloved Grandmother\\" and addressed his letters with the signature \\"Your faithful grandson Albert\\".Charles Grey, The youth of Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Gotha, 1868. Albert's brother, Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha also remembered his step- grandmother fondly; he quoted: \\"She had in her long life hardly an enemy and enjoyed until her death [...] a truly rare worship\\".Max Berbig, Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel, in: The wives of the rulers of the Duchy of Gotha, Gotha, 1890, p. 142. On 22 February 1848 Karoline Amalie died in the Winter Palace aged 76, after suffering from a chest illness as the Privilegirte Gothaische newspaper reported on the same day.Privilegirte Gothaische Newspaper, vol. 157, No. 38, 22 February 1848. Five days later, on 27 February, the last member of the Ducal family of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was buried in the Parkinsel in Gotha, next to her husband, and at her specific request, was performed \\"without pomp\\".Richard Waitz, The ducal grounds of the Parkinsel of Gotha from his creation to the present time, Gotha 1854, p. 17. Like all graves located here from the Ducal family there is no gravestone for Karoline Amalie. The simple floral circle, which once made the grave marked, for decades no longer exists, so the exact place of Karoline Amalie's is unknown today. Karoline Amalie was the last of the Duchess consorts from the line who Ernest I the Pious founded with the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. The male line of the house was already extinct since 1825 with the death of her brother-in-law, Duke Frederick IV.
