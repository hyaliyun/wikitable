History In The Alamo, the song is heard on the last night before the Battle of the Alamo. Davy Crockett (John Wayne), when asked what he is thinking, responds \\"not thinking. Just remembering\\" as the song is heard. The men of the Alamo reminisce on their lives and reflect on their own mistakes, faith, and morality. The song itself has no lyrical connection to the Alamo, or to any other historical events, but is simply a nostalgic reminiscence of the narrator's idyllic youth.http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-green-leaves-of- summer-lyrics-the-brothers-four.html The basic theme is reminiscent of the opening of Vivaldi's La Follia. \\"The Green Leaves of Summer\\" has been covered by a number of musicians including Brothers Four, Sil Austin, Kenny Ball & His Jazzmen, Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, Frankie Avalon, the Ray Conniff Singers, Ken Dodd, Anita Harris, The Springfields, Hampton Hawes, Mahalia Jackson, Frankie Laine, the Johnny Mann Singers, Patti Page, Nick Perito, Peter and Gordon and The Ventures.

Founded in 1965 by Stanley M. Joseph, the company had been continuously owned and operated by three generations of the Joseph family until it was sold to Samsung in August 2016. The company‚Äôs headquarters and 325,000 square-foot manufacturing facility are based in City of Industry, California. It distributes its products throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico, selling directly to over 1,300 dealer showrooms. The company operates a factory showroom in Los Angeles. History Dacor stove Stanley M. Joseph started his first business in 1933 when he opened a small retail appliance store in Northern California. He began manufacturing kitchen ventilation hoods with his brother Anthony in 1948, selling them under the name Stanthony. Stanthony Corp was incorporated in 1950. In 1959, Stanley Joseph was issued United States Patent 2,903,549 for a small electric barbecue unit, the first of its kind, designed for countertop use or to be built into a kitchen counter. He was also awarded a design patent for a combination vent hood and warming oven. The details of Stanley Joseph‚Äôs early experiences were documented in his book Adventures of a Salesman. Distinctive Appliances, Incorporated, better known as Dacor, was founded in 1965; Stanley Joseph‚Äôs sons, Stanford graduates and Vietnam veterans Michael and Anthony, led the company through its second generation, having learned the business from entry- level positions at very young ages. They ultimately purchased the company from him in 1982. In 1989, Stanley Joseph was inducted as a charter member into the National Kitchen & Bath Association (NKBA) Hall of Fame. His award notes that he developed the first fully self-contained ventilating hood for residential use, under his company name of Stanthony. Stanley Joseph‚Äôs sons, Michael and Anthony Joseph, were also inducted into the NKBA in 2004; their honor states that they have taken the industry one step further by creating new patents for kitchen appliances. To date, the Joseph family is the only family to have three NKBA Hall of Fame inductees. In September 2011, Stanley Joseph‚Äôs grandson, Stephen, took the helm of the company as President. In April 2013, Dacor announced that its Board of Directors elected Charles J. Huebner as the organization's CEO. In August 2016, the company announced its acquisition by Samsung Electronics America. The sale was closed the following month. According to the company press release, \\"Dacor will maintain its corporate identity and brand, with no changes to its operations and US-based manufacturing.\\" Partnerships In 2010, Dacor began a collaboration with BMW Group DesignworksUSA which led to the introduction of its Distinctive 36‚Äù Gas Cooktop, as well as the interface for its Discovery iQ Controller for its top- of-the-line wall ovens. In June 2014, Le Cordon Bleu, global network of culinary educational establishments, conducted ultra-premium appliance testing. Its Master Chefs tested a variety of high-end cooking appliances and deemed Dacor superior along numerous testing parameters. As a result, Le Cordon Bleu contacted Dacor to forge a strategic partnership. Dacor products now feature a Le Cordon Bleu seal of excellence, and Dacor ovens and ranges will be featured in upcoming Le Cordon Bleu cooking classes, demonstrations and academy kitchens. Awards To date, the Joseph family is the only family to have three members inducted into the National Kitchen & Bath Association (NKBA) Hall of Fame: * Stanley Joseph (1989) * Michael Joseph (2004) * Anthony Joseph (2004) Dacor, with longtime partner BMW Group DesignworksUSA, has been recognized with a 2013 GOOD DESIGN AWARD, the world‚Äôs most prestigious design awards program organized by the Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture and Design, for the Dacor Discovery iQ Graphical User Interface (GUI).

The high-performance computing cluster is operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university's central information technology organization. ITaP also operates clusters named Steele built in 2008, Coates built in 2009, Rossmann built in 2010, and Hansen built in the summer of 2011. Carter was the fastest campus supercomputer in the U.S. outside a national center when built. It was one of the first clusters to employ Intel's second generation Xenon E-5 \\"Sandy Bridge\\" processor and ranked 54th on the November 2011 TOP500 list, making it Purdue's first Top 100-ranked research computing system. Hardware The Carter cluster consists of HP Proliant compute nodes with two 8-core Intel Xeon-E5 processors (16 cores per node), either 32 gigabytes or 64 GB of memory, and a 500 GB system disk. NVIDIA Tesla GPU-accelerated nodes also are available. All nodes have 56 Gbit/s FDR Infiniband connections from Mellanox. Carter was the first cluster to employ this generation of Mellanox interconnects. Software Carter nodes run Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL6) and Carter uses Moab Workload Manager 6 and TORQUE Resource Manager 3 as the portable batch system (PBS) for resource and job management. The cluster also has compilers and scientific programming libraries installed. Funding The Carter supercomputer and Purdue's other clusters are part of the Purdue Community Cluster Program, a partnership between ITaP and Purdue faculty. In Purdue's program, a \\"community\\" cluster is funded by hardware money from grants, faculty startup packages, institutional funds and other sources. ITaP's Rosen Center for Advanced Computing administers the community clusters and provides user support. Each faculty partner always has ready access to the capacity he or she purchases and potentially to more computing power when the nodes of other investors are idle. Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Carter are made available to the National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) system and the Open Science Grid. Users The Purdue departments and schools by which Carter and Purdue's clusters are used vary broadly, including Aeronautics and Astronautics, Agriculture, Agronomy, Biology, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Communications, Computer and Information Technology, Computer Science, Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, Electrical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology, Industrial Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Physics, the Purdue Terrestrial Observatory and Statistics, among others. DiaGrid Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Carter are made available to XSEDE and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. Coates is part of Purdue's distributed computing Condor flock, which is the largest publicly disclosed distributed computing system in the world and the center of DiaGrid, a nearly 43,000-processor Condor-powered distributed computing network for research involving Purdue and partners at nine other campuses. Naming The Carter cluster is named for Dennis Lee Carter, the retired vice president for marketing of Intel, who received his master's degree in electrical engineering from Purdue in 1974. He is credited with creating and implementing the internationally recognized ‚ÄúIntel Inside‚Äù campaign, spurred by what Carter says was his recognition at the dawn of the PC age that Intel needed to begin talking to the general public, not just to the PC company design engineers who had been its traditional focus. The campaign created the first broad brand awareness of a microprocessor as a key ingredient in a personal computer and made Intel‚Äôs logo a feature on the outside of most of the world‚Äôs PCs, while its five-note jingle became one of the most recognizable tunes on television. Carter also worked with Intel President Andy Grove to create the iconic Pentium brand name.

The season also saw the emergence of Denis Glennon. Pre-match Westmeath had only ever appeared in two Leinster Senior Football Championship finals in their history: in 1931 and 1949. They went into the 2004 Leinster Senior Football Championship bidding to win their first ever title at senior level, with the only other counties still to achieve this being Wicklow and Fermanagh.

This threatened O'Connell's participation in the final. Kellaghan submitted a letter saying the offence had not happened.

Gregory, and written by Erin Gilmer. A sequel, with the tentative title of The Foundation: Blood Lake 2, was announced in 2005.  Plot  A septet of friends (Andy, Roger, Tricia, Max, Nell, Charlotte and Nicole) travel to a cluster of lakeside cabins, where they unearth a \\"blood book\\" that tells the story of Preacher Jacob, a priest who took over the nearby town's congregation in 1896. Jacob had his followers commit mass suicide under the belief that he could resurrect them as a new, perfect race enlightened by their deaths. Max and Nell go off to have sex, but before they do so Max skims the blood book and reads an incantation aloud, summoning the homicidal spirit of Preacher Jacob. The first of the group to be killed is Roger, who Preacher Jacob axes in the back. The preacher then captures Nicole, ties her to a tree, and hacks her to death with the axe. Next, Sam is garroted with a rope, while Nell has her throat slit in the shower. Tricia realizes what is going on, and tries to get help from Andy and Charlotte, but the two are kept sealed in their cabin by a supernatural force, which relents after Tricia flees at the sight of Preacher Jacob. Andy and Charlotte decide to barricade themselves in the cabin until sunrise, and pass the time by having sex. Later, Charlotte goes to wake Andy up, but finds Preacher Jacob in his bed. The undead holy man kills her, then goes after the wounded Andy (who has the blood book) and Tricia. Jacob chases Andy and Tricia to a dock, strangles Andy, and is seemingly destroyed when Tricia sets the blood book on fire. Tricia gets in one of the cars and drives away, but as she leaves the campgrounds, Preacher Jacob appears in the vehicle, and attacks her.  Cast  * C.J.

X Critic, which awarded a 0.5 out of 5, labeled Blood Lake \\"one of the worst hardcore releases in recent years\\" and opined that it felt \\"half completed, over edited and devoid of anything that makes terror and twat the least bit interesting\\".

[re]Search my Trash's Mike Haberfelner similarly condemned Blood Lake, writing, \\"Basically, this is hardcore porn and slasher movie rolled into one - and at least on paper that seems a good idea as slasher movies often use sexual allusions anyways, so why not just make the sex explicit? Unfortunately, Blood Lake doesn't quite function that way, as the sex scenes don't seem to be properly integrated into the plot, are pretty much just self-serving, too run-of-the-mill and invariably break up the narrative tension rather than contribute to it (that said, the girls are hot at least). Plus, on a narrative level, the film is full of non-sequiturs, and one fails to actually feel for the characters as they all lack depth or at least distinction. Now personally I'm all for narrative porn, but with this one one just wishes someone had tried to piece together an actual story than just throw genre mainstays at bland characters\\".

It was the second storm and first hurricane of the season, developing just off the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 12. While moving to the northwest, the storm began to quickly intensify the next day. It rapidly intensified from a category 1 hurricane to a category 4 with winds estimated at and an estimated central pressure of shortly before making landfall near Freeport, Texas, early on August 14. After landfall, the hurricane began to quickly weaken before dissipating over the Texas Panhandle. The storm caused heavy rainfall inland, peaking at in Angleton. Record rainfall rates were also reported in some areas. Power outages were reported in Galveston and San Antonio. The storm caused $7.5 million in damages, mostly to crops, and 40 deaths. Meteorological history The Freeport hurricane was first noted by ships on August 12 as a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico. However, it was suggested in later research that the disturbance may have originated from a low-pressure area between Belize and Honduras on August 11. Steadily moving to the northwest, the storm began to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 13, and soon after reaching major hurricane strength later that day. A report remarked that the storm was \\"phenomenal\\" due to the fact that previously the storm had \\"seemed to be of only moderate intensity\\" while near land before rapidly intensifying. The storm eventually reached winds of , making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. The hurricane proceeded to make landfall early on August 14 just east of Freeport with winds of . A ship just offshore of the coast reported a minimum pressure of , but the official estimate for the hurricane's landfall intensity was set to given the fact that the system was still rapidly intensifying at the time. Due to the storm's small size, it quickly weakened to tropical storm strength later that day. The storm finally weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating the next day over the Texas Panhandle. Preparations, impact, and aftermath In preparation for the storm, 150 vehicles evacuated out of Freeport, while water craft were taken up the Brazos River as far inland as possible. 100 families in Caplen and Gilchrist were also evacuated. The 38th division of the Texas National Guard, stationed in Palacios, was alerted due to the oncoming storm. alt=Lined contour map corresponding with different levels of rainfall during a three-day period. Heavy rainfall occurred across the coast and further inland due to the storm. Four locations set 24-hour rainfall records for the month of August, the highest of which was set near Angleton, recording of rain on August 13\\\\. Angleton also faced a water shortage after its pumping station was destroyed. The remnants of the storm produced as much as of rain in Oklahoma. Occupants in four vehicles were rescued by the United States Coast Guard near San Luis Pass. In Wharton, 800 birds went missing in the heavy rain. Galveston suffered primarily wind damage in the form of unroofed structures and broken windows. The Galveston Causeway was flooded by the heavy rain, preventing access from Galveston Island to the mainland. Several other roads were blocked by fallen trees. The city was also affected by a power outage after the storm caused loss of power and damaged communication lines. In addition, communication lines in San Antonio were damaged. At William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, 11 planes were damaged when a hangar collapsed, resulting in losses of $250,000. Hermann Park was also affected by the storm, where nine goats began to roam within the park due to a broken fence caused by a fallen limb. 35 convicts were freed from the Ramsey Unit state prison during the storm due to the chance of the prison collapsing. However, after the storm, only eight returned to the prison, leaving 27 others missing. After the storm, the American Red Cross brought supplies to areas affected by the hurricane, requesting as much as $10,000 in relief work. Several other local relief committees also brought supplies to affected areas. An estimated $2 million in damages from the storm were attributed to crop damage alone, especially rice and cotton. The storm was estimated to have killed 40 people and caused $7.5 million in damage.

He was the outstanding British two-year-old of 1887, when he was unbeaten in seven races. He was a sick horse when a beaten favourite in the following year's 2000 Guineas, but returned in the autumn to beat Minting in the Champion Stakes. Friar's Balsam was retired to stud where he had some success as a sire of winners. He was trained at Kingsclere by John Porter for Lord Alington and Sir Frederick Johnstone. Breeding Friar's Balsam was a chestnut colt foaled in 1885. His conformation was not perfect, as he was described as being \\"very much over at the knee\\". Friar's Balsam's sire was The Derby winner Hermit. His dam, Flower of Dorset, was sired by Breadalbane out of the Park Hill Stakes winner Imperatrice, the founder of Thoroughbred family 2-k. Racing career =1887: two-year-old season= Friar's Balsam began his racing career in the New Stakes at Ascot. In a field of seven that included Seabreeze and Ayrshire he won easily. After this race his owners Alington and Johnston refused an offer of ¬£10,000 for him. He followed the New Stakes up with a win in the Hurstborne Stakes at Stockbridge. His next start came in the July Stakes, where he beat Seabreeze by ¬æ length. His registered his fourth successive win in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood, carrying a ten-pound weight penalty. At the same meeting he also won the Molecombe Stakes in a walkover. After a break won the Middle Park Plate beating a field that again included Seabreeze. His seventh and final start of the season came in the Dewhurst Plate, where he won carrying a ten-pound penalty. =1888: three-year-old season= Friar's Balsam had been the favourite for the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby throughout the winter and spring. A small field of six went to post for the 2000 Guineas. Ridden by Tom Cannon, Friar's Balsam was the 1/3 favourite, Ayrshire was at 100/12 and Orbit was 100/8. Friar's Balsam began near the rear, but he never came to the front and was in trouble a long way from the finish. He eventually finished fifth, with Ayshire winning easily by two lengths. He had looked beaten only a quarter of a mile into the race and it was later found that an abscess in his mouth had burst in the opening stages. He was then taken out of the Derby. His first race back after the 2000 Guineas was the Lancashire Plate, where he finished unplaced and the race was won by Seabreeze. He started the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in a field that included Minting. Minting started favourite the 60/100 favourite, with Friar's Balsam at 5/2. After the start he settled in third place of the six runners. In the closing stages Friar's Balsam and Minting drew rapidly clear of the others before they had even been asked for an effort. With Friar's Balsam in a slight lead Minting tried to close, but could not and Friar's Balsam beat him by half a length without being extended, the two being well clear of the rest. =1889: four-year-old season= At the end of the 1888 season Friar's Balsam underwent an operation. His only run as a four-year-old was in the Royal Stakes at Kempton Park, where he finished unplaced behind Ayrshire. Stud record At stud Friar's Balsam sired Balsamo who won the valuable City and Suburban Handicap. He also sired Mother Siegel who was the dam of 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby winner Minoru. Another of his daughters, Grand Marnier, was the grandam of the Derby winner Grand Parade. Friar's Balsam's son Voter became a leading racehorse in North America, winning the Metropolitan Handicap. Voter in turn sired Ballot, who was rated the best older horse in America in 1908 and 1910. Friar's Balsam died in 1899 at the age of fourteen.

Biography  Otto Lipmann was born in Breslau on March 6, 1880. His parents were Emo Lipmann and Hulda Wendrina. In 1904, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Breslau. Over the years, Lipmann contributed to several fields of psychology, especially industrial psychology, with the development of the first selection tests for aviators in Germany, and also for typesetters, industrial apprentices, telegraphists and academic workers, amongst others. He also introduced the principles of vocational guidance in that country, and was the first psychologist to employ statistics in his works, which include ‚ÄúPsychische Geschlechtsunterschiede‚Äù, ‚ÄúWirtschaftspsychologie und psychologische Berufsberatung‚Äù, ‚ÄúDie psychologische Analyse der h√∂heren Berufe‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrundriss der Arbeitswissenschaft und Ergebnisse der arbeitswissenschaftlichen Statistik‚Äù. In 1906, along with psychologist William Stern, Lipmann founded the Institute for Applied Psychology in Berlin, and in 1908, the Journal of Applied Psychology (‚ÄúZeitschrift f√ºr angewandte Psychologie‚Äù). In 1920, along with , he founded the Institute of Professional and Business Psychology, which was in charge of the development of psychological tests of professional skills and vocational guidance. As a consequence of the rise of the National Socialist party in Germany, on 1 October 1933, Lipmann was discharged as an editor of the Journal of Applied Psychology. That same year he was forced to turn down a job offer from the University of Berlin, an opportunity he had considered due to his declining finances. Lipmann married Gertrude Wendrina, with whom he had two children, Hans (1908‚Äì1931)Peter Dudek: ‚ÄûAlles braver Durchschnitt‚Äú? Impressionen zur Sch√ºlerschaft der FSG Wickersdorf 1906‚Äì1945. In: JHB ‚Äì 23. Jahrbuch f√ºr Historische Bildungsforschung 2017. Julius Klinkhardt, Bad Heilbrunn 2018, , pp. 234‚Äì279 (citation: p. 258). and Emily Marta (born on 6 July 1907). On October 7, 1933, Lipmann died of an unexpected heart failure. In 1937, his daughter Emily emigrated from Germany, and so did his wife one year later. Gertrude died in Alexandria, Egypt, in December 1941. Emily married Vladimir Kaplun and they had three daughters, Katherine, Helen and Irene.  Science of Work  Lipmann proposes a distinction between ‚Äúcapacity-to-work‚Äù and ‚Äúpreparedness-to-work‚Äù. The former is defined as ‚Äúan individuals maximal performance under ideal conditions‚Äù, while the latter is related to the ‚Äúwillingness-to-work‚Äù, which involves the worker‚Äôs motivation and satisfaction, and can be increased with compensation systems and fair promotions, for example. As to vocational guidance, Lipmann says that psychological counseling ‚Äìcarried out through tests, questionnaires and analysis of professions‚Äì is more effective if it‚Äôs based on personality traits, which helps determine a suitable profession for each individual. He also proposes a classification for professions: lower, middle, and high. Since these classifications are based on the characteristics of the individuals, their boundaries are not fixed. For example, a worker can elevate a middle profession to a higher artistic level if he performs his tasks with creativity and imagination. At the same time, high professions can be subjective (imagination plays an important role) or objective (things are perceived without the influence of feelings or imagination). Lipmann was very critical of the scientific management approaches of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Lillian and Frank Gilbreth. He believed that loss of efficiency was related to the lack of interest from the workers, and feared that technological advances would damage the link between the worker and his work, generating more dissatisfaction.

Note the pea green and saffron colours and the flowery psychedelic design, common during this period. rned wallpaper and young woman with orange T-shirt in the 1960s 1960s d√©cor refers to a distinct style of interior decoration that became prominent in the 1960s and early 1970s. Green, (such as pea green and drab), yellow, pink, and orange (such as peach and saffron) hues were popular for wallpaper, carpets, curtains, sofas, chair seats, and cushions, often with patterns or bright flowers. English decorator David Hicks was an important influence on interiors in the 1960s, inspired by bright colours associated with India. Hicks popularized use of \\"psychedelic patterns and acid-edged colors,\\" peaking in the period 1967-1973, a time when there was interest in the Hippie movement and \\"flower power.\\" In the same era, Dorothy Draper, one of Manhattan's top interior decorators of the 1960s, used 'dull' white and 'shiny' black as one of her favorite combinations. The \\"Retro Modern\\" style is associated with the decades of the 1950s and 1960s. As a furniture material, polypropylene, which was manufactured in colors that could be matched to paint chips, came into its own. Foam molding, mostly used as upholstery cushions, became a basic structural unit for furniture in the early 1960s. Large areas, such as sofas, beds, carpets, drapes and wallcovers, were covered in vibrant colors and patterns. Employing \\"psychedelic intensity\\", the colors and styles were influenced by India, Spain, and the Mediterranean. In the 1950s and 1960s, specialized patterns in wall painting were developed.

Pink or orange paintwork, bedspreads, and curtains, which were fashionable in the 1960s, however, are considered by some to be \\"hideous\\" or \\"painful,\\" today. As Paul Evans put it, \\"For many the popular image of 1960s home design was of ephemerality and excess, of plastic or paper chairs and lurid carpets and wallpaper.\\" Television series from the era, such as The Avengers, Batman, The Man from U.N.C.L.E, Bewitched, The Saint, and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) provide fine examples of the type of d√©cor popular during this period and are an important aspect of the look of the productions; for the latter, orange hues are included in the title design.

The game was announced at Zynga's June 2012 Unleashed event, debuted August 2012 on Facebook, and was released October 3, 2012 on Zynga.com. Within the first month of its release, ChefVille had become the No. 1 Facebook game. As of early October 2012, ChefVille had more than 4.8 million daily active users (DAU) and more than 45 million monthly active users (MAU). On March 31, 2015, Zynga announced ChefVille would be one of 11 games to be closed. History ChefVille is Zynga's second game in the restaurant genre following Caf√© World, a Facebook game with 456,000 DAU and 2.4 million MAU as of early October 2012. The main differences are that ChefVille players interact with the environment outside their virtual restaurant and earn real recipes as they progress in the game. ChefVille is available for free in 17 languages on Facebook. Gameplay ChefVille players act as chef, restaurant owner, designer and manager with the goal of creating a ‚Äòdream restaurant.‚Äô Players customize restaurants to specific themes, such as a 1950s diner or an Italian restaurant, and they mix and match food types while cooking and serving. Players also choose the restaurant d√©cor, from sushi stations and cold stations to woks and grills, and cook menu items that correlate with their cooking equipment. Similar to other Zynga ‚Äòville‚Äô games, players are given tools needed to build their restaurants. Players cook dishes using various appliances, such as a brick oven for cooking pizza. As the game progresses, players help friends by sharing needed recipe ingredients, by dining in their friends‚Äô restaurants, and by helping friends build their restaurants. Players can also purchase food and ingredients with actual currency. With ChefVille‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame to Table‚Äô feature, players who master a dish can receive a recipe for that dish by email. At the time of launch, the game included more than 200 in-game recipes, 50 of which players could earn. Game recipes include Confit de Canard with Potatoes au Gratin, Miso Soup, Bruschetta and Roasted Asparagus with Hollandaise. ChefVille recipes are created by Zynga Executive Chef Matthew Du Trumble and his team of 15 company chefs. Zynga CEO Mark Pincus and his wife contributed a Spaghetti Bolognese recipe to the game. Players also have the ability to show off their own recipes in the game. ChefVille takes place on a map segmented into a grid, with new areas unlocked as players meet milestones or spend actual currency. Recipe ingredients are obtained from raw materials acquired from visiting spots on the map, such as a butcher for fresh beef, a milk truck for fresh milk, and a breadbox for bread. Currency ChefVille players earn rewards and receive help from friends for free. They can also use actual currency to buy recipe ingredients or borrow food from friends by dining in their restaurants. Partnerships On September 19, 2012, Zynga and Food Network announced a promotion in which celebrity chef Robert Irvine appeared as a virtual avatar within the game. For two weeks, virtual Robert Irvine guided ChefVille players through a series of quests and helped players enhance their in-game restaurants.

The Tarbelli were an Aquitani pre-Roman tribe settled in what today is southwestern France, between the river Adour and the Pyrenees. The capital of the Tarbelli people was Aquae Tarbellicae, present-day Dax. They lived in Labourd, in the Northern Basque Country, in the present-day French department of the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques. Orthez was also an important Tarbelli city.  Name  The Tarbelli are mentioned as Tarbelli by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC),Caesar.

Naturalis Historia, 4:108  Language  The historical territory of the Tarbelli has been found to correspond very well with what has been learned of the extension of the Lapurdian dialect of the Basque language. Like all other Aquitanians the people spoke an archaic form of the Basque language known as Aquitanian language. Its dialects are unknown.  History  The Tarbelli are mentioned by Roman authors; Julius Caesar names them Tarbelli quatuorsignani, \\"Tarbelli of the four banners\\"; this means that the Tarbelli were a confederacy of four different tribes. They lived in a small territory in what today is the southwest of France, between the river Adour and the Pyrenees. This region was known as the traditional province of Labourd, of the Northern Basque Country. Their capital city was Aquae Tarbellicae, present-day Dax, and They are presumably related to other Aquitani tribes, including the Vascones, among others. During the Roman times, the Tarbelli territory was part of a greater region the occupiers called Novempopulania.

The ETR 200 entered in service in 1937. In the early 1960s the remaining sixteen ETR 200 units were converted to ETR 220 by adding a fourth car and other changes. The ETR 240 entered in service in the late 1980s and remained in service until the late 1990s and were used for charter trains up and in the Civitavecchia -Rome line. There were obtained by modification (mainly in interior trims and contents) of 6 of ETR220 (AV version).

The perpetrator, Richard Komakech, shot and killed 26 people at the party before he was apprehended and subsequently killed in revenge.  Massacre  Richard Komakech, a private in the Ugandan military police, was attending the wedding when he requested a female guest, Irene Ati, to dance with him. Ati declined the offer, but Komakech repeatedly insisted she dance with him to the point he became aggressive and had to be separated from her. Komakech began rioting and was expelled from the festivities. The drunken private then went to fetch a semi-automatic rifle and returned to the party about ten minutes later. Komakech first killed Irene Ati, and then started shooting randomly at the guests, in which 14 people died on the spot (including Irene Ati) and 12 more later died in hospital, while 13 others were seriously wounded. Komakech eventually attempted to commit suicide with his rifle by shooting himself in the mouth, though he suffered only wounds to his forehead and pretended to be dead until police arrived.

She was launched in July 1938 by Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn on Tyneside in England and was completed in February 1939. She was one of a class of 20 similar tankers built for Anglo- Saxon. In 1944 Daronia survived being hit by two German torpedoes, and in 1958 she survived being hit by a bomb in an air raid by the CIA. Shell withdrew Daronia from service in 1960 and she was scrapped in November of that year. Torpedoed and repaired On 18 August 1944 Daronia left the Port of Durban, Union of South Africa, in ballast and with a partial deck cargo of empty oil drums and general cargo. She was part of Convoy DN-68, sailing northwards in the Indian Ocean for dispersal further up the coast of East Africa. At 1941 hrs on 20 August Daronia was between South Africa and Madagascar at a position of when the Kriegsmarine Type IXD U-boat commanded by Korvettenkapit√§n J√ºrgen Oesten hit her with two torpedoes. These did not sink Daronia and Captain Ritchie returned her safely to Durban, where she arrived on 26 August and remained for the remainder of World War II. After the war she was repaired and in February 1946 she was returned to service. Bombed by the CIA On 28 April 1958 Daronia was in Balikpapan Harbour, in the East Kalimantan Province of Borneo when a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, flown by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, attacked the Shell oil terminal there. The Invader bombed a larger tanker, Eagle Oil and Shipping's , setting her on fire and sinking her, and then attacked Daronia. Daronia and her sister ships had unusually high ventilators for their mid-ship pump rooms. The B-26 dropped a 500-pound (227-kg) bomb that hit her port ventilator, but instead of exploding it bounced off towards her starboard ventilator and then fell harmlessly into the sea. Daronia had a full load of petrol, so if the bomb had detonated the effects would almost certainly have been devastating. As a consequence Daronia left Balikpapan that same day for the safety of Singapore, taking with her 26 of San Flavianos rescued crew. A further 24 crew from San Flaviano followed a few days later on another Anglo-Saxon tanker, . Shell also evacuated shore- based wives and families to Singapore and suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan. In June 1958 both the Indonesian and UK governments claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels. In fact only the radio operator was from the Permesta rebels in North Sulawesi. The B-26, its bombs and its pilot, former USAAF officer William H. Beale, were sent by the CIA as part of US covert support for the rebellion. The CIA pilots had orders to target foreign merchant ships to drive foreign trade away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and destabilising the Indonesian government of President Sukarno. Shell's suspension of operations and partial evacuation of personnel was exactly what the CIA attack was intended to achieve. For some months previously, UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd had supported US policy to supply Permesta. On 6 May 1958, more than a week after the CIA sank San Flaviano and hit Daronia, Lloyd secretly told US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that this was still his position. On 18 May, Indonesian forces shot down a different Permesta B-26 and captured its CIA pilot, Allen Pope. Nevertheless, in June 1958 both Indonesia and the UK publicly claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels, concealing the CIA involvement of which both governments were well aware. Withdrawal and scrapping Daronia remained in Shell service until 1960. In November of that year she was scrapped in British Hong Kong.

Designed, beginning in 1974, by John M. Conroy of the Turbo-Three Corporation, it was to incorporate a pair of Boeing B-52 Stratofortress fuselages to form a new craft using existing parts for cost-savings.\\"Space Shuttle Orders Giant Plane Developed\\" The Modesto Bee. February 13, 1974, p.A17. While the project was seriously considered, it proved impractically large and NASA chose to develop the Boeing 747-based Shuttle Carrier from surplus commercial aircraft instead. History The Space Shuttle was originally designed to use on-board turbofan engines for propulsion within the atmosphere on re-entry and for ferry flights between landing sites, such as Edwards Air Force Base, the White Sands Missile Range or contingency landing sites such as Easter Island, to the launch site at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral.Lowther 2012, p. 26. When the air- breathing engines were deleted from the Shuttle design due to cost and weight concerns, a requirement arose for a transport aircraft capable of carrying the Shuttle from landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center.Jenkins 2001, p. 195. One early design for a shuttle carrier aircraft was proposed by John M. Conroy, developer of the Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy oversized cargo aircraft, in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center; named Virtus, a contract was issued for design and development work in 1974. Expected to cost US$12.5 million each (equivalent to $ million in ), Virtus was a twin- fuselage design powered by four large jet engines; it was intended for these to be Pratt & Whitney JT9D turbofans. Conroy proposed extensive use of 'off the shelf' military parts in the design to reduce costs; this included the use of fuselages from Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers to form the aircraft's main fuselage pods, added to a new wing and tail section.Lowther 2012, p. 28. The Space Shuttle Orbiter would be carried under the center section of the Virtus aircraft's wing, between the fuselages; other large cargoes, including the Space Shuttle external tank, the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, or dedicated cargo pods, could be alternatively carried. The Virtus design was tested in the NASA Langley wind tunnel; while the results of the wind tunnel tests were considered promising, the drawbacks of such a large design, including the cost of developing an entirely new aircraft, flight testing the design and the sheer size of the aircraft requiring the development and/or expansion of infrastructure to support it, militated against further development of Virtus.The Lockheed Corporation, which had proposed a twin-fuselage version of its C-5 Galaxy airlifter to carry the Shuttle, also saw its proposal rejected for the same reasons. A more modest conversion of existing C-5s was proposed and nearly taken up by NASA but it was determined that having aircraft continually available was preferable to being restricted by the United States Air Force on the use of C-5s and a proposal by Boeing for a conversion of the 747 airliner was selected, becoming the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. A proposed commercial version of the Virtus design, named Colossus, also failed to gain any further interest, and the Virtus design was abandoned.Cargo Aircraft, volume 64. R. H.

It took over operation of .ORG in January 2003 and launched the .NGO and .ONG top-level domains in March 2015. In November 2019, it was announced the Public Interest Registry would be sold by the Internet Society to private equity investment firm Ethos Capital for 1.135 billion USD, but in April 2020, ICANN decided to reject the sale. History The Domain Name System was created in 1983 to create a more stable and redundant network of networks and to make the internet simpler for more people to use. .ORG was one of the original top- level domains (along with .COM, .EDU, .MIL, and .GOV) that launched a year later in 1984. .ORG was intended to be the home for organizations of a non- commercial character that did not meet the requirements for the other top- level domains. From 1984 to 1992, .ORG was managed by the Stanford Research Institute under a grant from the United States government. At this time, .ORG domain names were issued free of charge upon request. In 1993, the operations of .ORG were privatized and transferred from the Stanford Research Institute to Network Solutions ‚Äì the single-bidder for further developing the domain name registration service for the internet ‚Äì under a five-year agreement with the National Science Foundation. Network Solutions charged $100 per .ORG domain name for a two-year registration, a rate that was subsequently lowered to $70 following a 1997 lawsuit charging Network Solutions with antitrust violations. In 1998, the United States Department of Commerce issued the white paper that resulted in the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). One early decision that ICANN made was to create a vertical separation of registries (the party that manages the underlying database of domain names) and registrars (the party that acts as a retail provider of domain names). The creation of ICANN brought some competition to the domain name industry when new generic top-level domains like .BIZ, .INFO, and .MUSEUM launched in 2001. Network Solutions, however, retained its monopoly over .ORG, as well as .COM and .NET. Network Solutions was acquired by Verisign in 2000. In 2001, in order to keep .COM and .NET (the most financially lucrative of the legacy top-level domains), Verisign voluntarily agreed to surrender its control of .ORG by 2003. At the time, ICANN stated that transferring .ORG away from Verisign and to a new, purpose-built registry would ‚Äúreturn the .ORG registry to its original purpose,‚Äù and enable .ORG to return ‚Äúto its originally intended function as a registry operated by and for non-profit organizations.‚Äù Furthermore, article 5.1.4 of the 2001 .ORG Registry Agreement between ICANN and Verisign required that Verisign ‚Äúpay to ICANN or ICANN‚Äôs designee the sum of US $5 million, to be used by ICANN in it [sic] sole discretion to establish an endowment to be used to fund future operating costs of the non-profit entity designated by ICANN as successor operator of the .ORG registry.‚Äù The criteria for re-assigning .ORG included: * Criteria 4 (differentiation): ‚ÄúA key objective is differentiation of the .ORG TLD from TLDs intended for commercial purposes. ‚Ä¶ Proposals should include detailed planned marketing practices designed to ‚Ä¶ promote and attract registrations from the global noncommercial community‚Äù * Criteria 5 (responsiveness to the noncommercial community): ‚ÄúThe successor operator‚Äôs policies and practices should strive to be responsive to and supportive of the noncommercial Internet user community‚Äù; * Criteria 6 (public support among noncommercial users): ‚ÄúDemonstrated support among registrants in the .ORG TLD, particularly those actually using .ORG domain names for noncommercial purposes‚Äù and * Criteria 7 (affordability): ‚ÄúIn view of the noncommercial character of many present and future .ORG registrants, affordability is important. A significant consideration will be the price at which the proposal commits to provide initial and renewal registrations.‚Äù Eleven bids for .ORG were received from operators who were assessed as being qualified to manage the registry. The Internet Society was among the 11 bidders. Though the Internet Society did not receive the absolute highest score out of the 11 bids, as assessed by independent and staff evaluators, it was nonetheless awarded a perpetual contract to manage .ORG. Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the .ORG Registry Agreement outline that, provided there have not been breaches of payment obligations to ICANN and there have not been three or more ‚Äúfundamental and material breach[es]‚Äù of the contract, the contract will automatically renew for a further 10 years ‚Äì in perpetuity. The reason for awarding the contract to the Internet Society included the Internet Society‚Äôs global membership, important mission, and non-profit status. In 2002, the Internet Society was in a dire financial position. There were significant concerns that the Internet Society‚Äôs financial position could sink .ORG. In order to address these concerns, the Internet Society proposed creating the Public Interest Registry as a separate 501(c)3 non-profit to manage .ORG and to insulate it from the Internet Society. The Public Interest Registry was established with a membership of one, the Internet Society, governed by a separate board. The decision made by the ICANN Board to allocate .ORG to the Internet Society was consistent with RFC 1591, which states that ‚Äúa designated manager for a domain‚Äù is a ‚Äútrustee for the delegated domain, and ha[s] a duty to serve the community.‚Äù The community that .ORG was intended to serve is non- profit organizations, and Lynn St. Armor, who was then President and CEO of the Internet Society, committed the Internet Society to working to ensure that the non-governmental sector shaped any decisions affecting the .ORG ecosystem. Afilias was selected as the back-end technical provider for .ORG under contract with the Public Interest Registry. The then-largest domain transfer in history occurred on January 1, 2003, when ICANN had VeriSign delegate 2.6 million domains to Public Interest Registry. An Internet Society Vice President, David Maher, became the chairman. The following month, Ed Viltz became the organization's first CEO. Marc Rotenberg, the founding Board Chair of the Public Interest Registry, stated in an op-ed that when the Public Interest Registry was established, ‚Äúour aim was to promote the non-commercial use of the internet ‚Ä¶ We believed there should be a space of the Internet to promote non-commercial use and that the governance of the .ORG domain should respect the essential character of the users of the domain.‚Äù On June 23, 2010, Public Interest Registry's technology provider Afilias implemented the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol for .ORG, making .ORG the first open gTLD to sign its zone. DNSSEC is intended to prevent cache poisoning attacks by making sure internet users arrive at the URL they intended. The implementation began in test environments in mid-2009. The protocol was implemented by Public Interest Registry's technical partner Afilias during the tenure of former CEO, Alexa Raad, who played a role in creating the DNSSEC Industry Coalition. Raad resigned from Public Interest Registry in late 2010. The non-profit had an interim CEO, until it recruited former Afilias executive Brian Cute as its third chief executive officer on January 14, 2011. After a successful tenure, Brian Cute stepped down as CEO in May 2018. After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, Public Interest Registry waived renewal fees for Japan-based .org domains to prevent them from expiring due to intermittent internet access. In 2017, PIR renegotiated their agreement with Afilias to manage their registrations, reducing their overhead. On 17 December 2018, Jon Nevett became CEO of the Public Interest Registry. On 13 May 2019, ICANN announced that they would remove the price cap on .ORG registrations. Sale of the Public Interest Registry  = Events leading up to the sale = In October 2017, the Internet Society established the Internet Society Foundation as a separate legal entity. It received a favorable determination letter issued by the IRS in April 2018. There were no public announcements about the creation of this organization until November 2018. In fiscal year 2017, the Public Interest Registry transmitted $43m to the Internet Society Foundation from its securities holdings in order for the Internet Society Foundation to establish an endowment. These are the first indications that the Internet Society may have been looking to divest itself of the Public Interest Registry. The Internet Society appointed three new trustees to the Public Interest Registry Board for terms beginning 1 May 2018. Brian Cute, who had been CEO of the Public Interest Registry for seven years, abruptly resigned a week later, with no explanation offered for his departure. He was replaced on an interim basis by one of the new trustees, Jay Daley. Andrew Sullivan joined the Internet Society as President and CEO in September 2018. Earlier in his career, Sullivan worked for Afilias and supported ISOC in its bid to acquire .ORG. In ISOC‚Äôs original 2002 proposal, Sullivan is listed as the senior architect who would be responsible for the smooth transition of .ORG from Verisign‚Äôs backend to Afilias‚Äô systems. = Removal of price caps on .ORG domains to increase value of asset = The Public Interest Registry has a perpetual contract to run .ORG. Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the .ORG Registry Agreement outline that, provided there have not been breaches of payment obligations to ICANN and there have not been three or more ‚Äúfundamental and material breach[es]‚Äù of the contract, the contract will automatically renew for a further 10 years in perpetuity. There were a number of substantial modifications made to the .ORG Registry Agreement in 2019. Among the most significant changes to the .ORG Registry Agreement was the removal of consumer protection mechanisms such as price caps. Until this time, the Public Interest Registry had been unable to raise the wholesale price of a .ORG domain by more than 10% per annum. The .ORG Registry Agreement was published on the ICANN website in March 2019 and opened for public comment. Over 3,000 public comments were submitted from non-profit and non-governmental organizations and individuals from around the world. An independent analysis found that fewer than 1% of commenters supported the decision. Nonetheless, on 13 May 2019, ICANN advised that it would not alter the .ORG Registry Agreement based upon the public input received. The only justification that ICANN has provided for the removal of price caps is that it has sought to harmonize contracts in order to become a more efficient organization. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a reconsideration request to the ICANN Board, argued that the ‚Äúefficiency of harmonized contracts‚Äù should not outweigh ‚ÄúICANN‚Äôs mission of coordinating the allocation and assignment of names in the [Domain Name System] through policies developed through a bottom-up, consensus-based multistakeholder process.‚Äù After public comments closed, the Public Interest Registry released an open letter on 1 May 2019, stating, ‚ÄúThe .ORG Community always is considered in every decision we make here at Public Interest Registry. Rest assured, we will not raise prices unreasonably. In fact, we currently have no specific plans for any price increases for .ORG.‚Äù = Sale is announced by the Internet Society = One week after public comments closed, former ICANN CEO Fadi Chehad√© registered the domain name EthosCapital.com. On 14 May 2019, Ethos Capital was incorporated in Delaware under file number 7418715. On 13 November 2019 the Internet Society announced that it was divesting of the Public Interest Registry, and that Ethos Capital would be acquiring its assets, including its holdings of Registry Agreements. It would later be confirmed that Chehad√© was an advisor to Ethos Capital, and that he was present at a meet-and-greet with the staff of the Public Interest Registry at their office in Virginia. Following concerns that the sale could result in price gouging, given the elimination of price caps, Ethos Capital stated on their website, \\"Our plan is to live within the spirit of historic practice when it comes to pricing,\\" which they later clarified to mean raising prices by an average of 10% per year. This is the maximum that the Public Interest Registry was allowed to raise prices starting in 2016, though it never chose to do so. The sale led to a public outcry over PIR's transition to a for-profit venture, especially in view of the removal of price caps on .org registrations. People who came out in opposition to the sale included Tim Berners-Lee and Marc Rotenberg, the first chair of the Public Interest Registry, as well as previous Trustees along with the first Executive Director of the Internet Society. The Internet Society later confirmed that no human rights impact assessment was carried out prior to the sale, no consultation with impacted stakeholders was completed, and no safeguards were in place to protect the interests of .ORG, .NGO, and .ONG registrants. On 22 November 2019 NTEN launched a website savedotorg.org for organizations and others to express their opposition to the sale. Over 25,000 people signed a petition opposing the sale, and a demonstration was held outside ICANN's office in Los Angeles in January 2020. On 29 November 2019, it was revealed that the purchase price is $1.135 billion. In late January 2020, ICANN halted its final approval of the sale after the Attorney General of California requested detailed documentation from all parties, citing concerns that both ICANN and the Internet Society had potentially violated their public interest missions as registered charities subject to the laws of California. In February, the Internet Society's Chapter Advisory Council (which represents its membership) began the process to adopt a motion rejecting the sale if certain conditions were not complied with.. On 30 April 2020, the ICANN Board, saying it was \\"the right thing to do,\\" withheld its consent to the transfer of control of the Public Internet Registry to Ethos Capital, effectively killing the proposed deal. . Domains =.ORG= The number of .ORG domains registered with the Public Interest Registry .ORG is the third largest generic top-level domain of the Domain Name System used in the internet. .ORG domains have been registered by Public Interest Registry since 2003. Craigslist.org and Wikipedia.org are among the more popular .org users. Since 2009, Public Interest Registry has published a bi-annual report called \\"The Dashboard\\" on the number of registered .ORG domains. There were more than 8 million registered .ORG in 2009, 8.8 million in 2010, and 9.6 million in 2011. Public Interest Registry registered the ten millionth .org domain in June, 2012. In June 2015 there were 10.5 million .org domains registered. Public Interest Registry promotes and publicizes the .ORG domain. While .ORG is an open domain, Public Interest Registry wants more people to view .ORG as a domain for communities and entities that serve the public good, rather than being perceived as directed to non-profits. In 2010, Public Interest Registry launched \\"WhyIChose.org\\" as part of campaign to promote the .ORG domain extension. It conducted a survey of consumers in 2011 on how domain names are perceived by internet users. The survey found that 81 percent of Americans still rely on an organization's website before Twitter or Facebook. It also suggested .ORG sites were seen as more trustworthy. Respondents were more likely to turn to .ORG websites in a crisis, more likely to post content on .ORG sites and to trust information on a .ORG domain. It also found that younger age groups were almost twice as likely to register a .ORG as Americans age 55-64. In July 2015, Public Interest Registry marked the 30th anniversary of the first .ORG registration, and launched a website featuring a timeline of .ORG registrations from 1985 to 2015 and a gallery of .ORG websites. The first .ORG domain name to be registered was mitre.org. =.NGO and .ONG= In June 2011, ICANN expanded the internet's naming system to allow applications for new top-level domain names. Public Interest Registry declared publicly an interest in the .NGO domain in August 2011 and applied for it in May 2012. It also applied for an equivalent domain, .ONG, which stands for \\"Organisation Non Gouvernementale\\" in French, and is also recognizable in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and other Romance languages. Unlike the .ORG domain, .NGO will require validation of the registrant's non-governmental status. Non-governmental organizations told Public Interest Registry they needed a closed domain that validated the legitimacy of websites accepting online donations to avoid fraud. Public Interest Registry plans to use the funds from selling .NGO domains to develop an \\"NGO Community Program\\" to reach out to NGOs in developing nations. It also intends to create a directory service of NGOs to support their SEO and visibility, and develop a closed community for NGOs to learn from each other. The new domains have been publicly available since May 6, 2015. Advocacy Public Interest Registry often supports ICANN on policy and privacy issues on the internet. In 2003, Public Interest Registry wrote a letter to ICANN supporting its opposition of wildcard redirection services that automatically redirect internet users to correct spelling errors and typos. The letter supported ICANN's request for VeriSign to voluntarily suspend a DNS wildcard service called Site Finder and asked ICANN to make a policy against similar services across the internet. Public Interest Registry and other organizations opposed the move by VeriSign, because automatic redirects may affect spam filters and mail servers that rely on error messages from non-existent domains. Public Interest Registry reduced domain tasting by charging fees to registrars that cancel 90 percent of their domains in less than five days. In 2007, ICANN used that as a model for a similar proposal to curb domain tasting through non-refundable fees. Public Interest Registry supported ICANN's expansion of top-level domain names. The CEO, Brian Cute, commented that internet users will still gravitate towards established domain names, but new domains will target specific communities. Public Interest Registry has also urged ICANN to address privacy implications of the WHOIS database. The organization is critical of the security of DNS filtering techniques and supports the DNSSEC protocol. It also shuts down .org-based phishing scams.

Toms was the son of an engraver, William Henry Toms, of Masham Street, Westminster. Apprenticed to the portraitist Thomas Hudson, he became a drapery-painter, and worked for Francis Cotes for several years. After Cotes' death, he was employed by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West and John Zoffany amongst others. He also held the post of Port Culis Pursuivant. at the College of Heralds. According to Edward Edwards: > Among the pictures which he did for Sir Joshua, are some very excellent; and > candour must allow, that many of Sir Joshua's best whole-lengths are those, > to which Toms painted the draperies: Among these was the picture of Lady > Elizabeth Keppel, in the dress she wore as bride-maid to the Queen ; for > which he was paid the sum of twelve guineas, a very slender price in > proportion to the merit of the piece, but Sir Joshua was not remarkably > liberal upon these occasions, of which circumstance Mr. Toms did not neglect > to complain.

On 7 August, Sharp's uncle, David Sharp, made a televised plea for her safe return. Fifty-five sightings were reported by members of the public, but none were substantiated. Eighty police officers were assigned to the search, and 800 hours of CCTV footage were collected. On 9 August, Hazell gave an interview to Mark Williams-Thomas for ITV News, denying that he had done anything to Sharp and praying for her safe return. Investigation On 10 August, a body was discovered in a black bed sheet in a black bag in the loft of the home of Sharp's grandmother, after police visited it for the fourth time. Police launched a search for Hazell, and arrested him on suspicion of murder that evening at 8:25pm at Cannon Hill Common, Morden, after a tip-off from a member of the public. It was later announced that two further arrests had been made: Sharp's grandmother, Christine Bicknell, on suspicion of murder, and Bicknell's neighbour, Paul Meehan, on suspicion of assisting an offender. Bicknell and Meehan were subsequently bailed. Commander Neil Basu, the officer in charge of the investigation, apologised to Tia Sharp's mother for the delay in finding her daughter's body. He blamed human error and said that a review would be undertaken \\"to ensure such a failing is not repeated\\". Shortly after Hazell's arrest, memory cards were recovered from Christine Bicknell's residence. One was particularly well hidden in a door frame on the ground floor of the property. Police were able to recover images and videos, some of which had been deleted. Some of the files portrayed Tia in sexual positions, believed to have been taken post-mortem, whereas others were voyeuristic images of when Tia was still alive, for example videos of Tia applying moisturiser to her legs, or of Tia asleep in her bedroom. It has been suggested by Forensic Psychologist Dr Keri Nixon that Hazell may have kept these images for later sexual gratification.Britain's Darkest Taboos, S3: Ep. 2, 2016 In the early hours of 12 August, Hazell was charged with the murder of Sharp. He appeared before Camberwell Green magistrates' court on 13 August via video-link. No plea was entered and the case was committed to the Old Bailey for trial, with a first appearance on 15 August, also via video-link, with a preliminary hearing set for 19 November and a provisional trial date set for 21 January 2013. He was remanded in custody to Belmarsh prison where he was kept in isolation for his own safety. A post-mortem on the body began on 10 August, and paused later that day. By 16 August, the post-mortem had still not been completed, but at an inquest into the death, which opened that day, it was confirmed that the body was that of Tia Sharp. The post-mortem later concluded without establishing the cause of death. Experts told This is Croydon Today that the delay in finding the body made it much harder to establish the cause of death, and that without a cause of death the prosecution would find it much harder to build a case. However, detectives suspected, and it was widely reported, that Tia Sharp was smothered, although this was not officially proven to be the cause of death. It has been suggested by Forensic Psychologist Dr Keri Nixon that Hazell may have made sexual advances towards Tia, and murdered her when she rebuffed him and threatened to tell her mother.Britain's Darkest Taboos, S3: Ep. 2, 2016 On 23 August police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe addressed his force's failure to find Sharp's body. He said the error could not be attributed to a single officer, and that he wanted to \\"understand what processes and management decisions we've made that led to that failure.\\" Tia Sharp was cremated on 14 September, after a private family funeral. Court proceedings It was announced on 26 November 2012 that Hazell would face trial in May 2013. On 7 December, the Metropolitan Police announced that Christine Bicknell would not face charges. On 5 February 2013, neighbour Paul Meehan was charged with wasting police time. He appeared at Croydon magistrates' court on 28 February 2013, where he denied the charge against him and was released on bail for a one-day trial on 29 July. Hazell pleaded not guilty to murder when he appeared in court on 8 March 2013. The trial of Hazell began on 7 May 2013 before Mr Justice Nicol. On 13 May, Hazell changed his plea to guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment on 14 May with a minimum term of 38 years, meaning he will be 75 years old before he is eligible for parole. On 5 August 2013, Meehan was found guilty of wasting police time and sentenced to five months in prison. Aftermath In June 2013, Sharp's biological father, Steven Carter, announced that he was going to be a father again, as his girlfriend was pregnant. In July 2013, Carter said he backed a plan for websites to be told to block certain search terms and warn people when they try to view illegal content. In June 2013, the home of Christine Bicknell and Stuart Hazell, where Tia Sharp was murdered, was demolished and in mid-2014, work began on new houses being built on the site. In November 2013, partly in response to the murders of Tia Sharp and April Jones, the search engines Google and Bing modified their systems to block results from searches aimed at producing child abuse images. In March 2014, the murder of Tia Sharp was featured in CI Channel's series, Britain's Darkest Taboos, as the first episode of Series 3, broadcast on 16 March 2014.

It was released on 29 May 2014 in North America for the PC. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 10 December 2015 whilst the Xbox One version was released on 3 June 2016. A definitive remaster titled Among The Sleep: Enhanced Edition was released for PC on November 2, 2017, and later released for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch on May 29, 2019. Gameplay Among the Sleep is a first-person exploration game seen from the view of a toddler. The player can move the cursor to walk or crawl around, the latter of which is faster and is required to slide through obstacles blocking the way. Running is also an available option, though the player will fall down if it is done for too long. The player can interact with and push objects, and open doors and windows. Sometimes, the handle to open doors is too tall to reach for the player, in which case the player will have to push and climb chairs for additional height. Other than chairs, the player can climb boxes, tables, and various things to reach otherwise unreachable ledges and heights. Certain objects can also be held as well as thrown away. Others can be stored to the inventory and taken out again for later use. For most of the game, the player is accompanied by a sentient teddy bear named Teddy, a birthday present from the toddler's father. The player can hug Teddy, who emits light that helps the player navigate through darker environments. The light will wear down after a while, but will recharge if left unused. If the player drops Teddy, which always happens whenever they arrive from sliding through pipes to a new level or environment, they will have to pick it up first before advancing again. Throughout the game, the player is followed by two monsters: a feminine figure that haunts the first three levels, and a trench coat-wearing figure that haunts the final level. The monsters' appearance is indicated by the blurring of the vision, grating sounds, and in the case of the feminine figure, a slow lullaby (', \\"Trollmother's Lullaby\\") hummed about. There is no way to fend off the monsters; if they appear, the player will have to run away or hide under tables or chairs until they go away. If the player is not quick enough to evade the monsters, a short cinematic will show the monsters taking hold of the player, which results in a game over, followed by a continue screen with a pacifier. Clicking the pacifier restarts the game from the last checkpoint. The player can also get a game over by other means, such as falling into water or chasms. The game is largely linear and involves going from point A to B, though the expansive environment with multiple obstacles may induce the feeling of being lost. After some time exploring the player's house, the player is taken to a dreamlike location with a gingerbread house-like hut that serves as a sort of hub level. The house contains a circular door that leads to a new level, surrounded by four containers where \\"memories\\" obtained from each level are stored. After the player finds a memory and heads to a tube at the end of the level, they will be returned to this hut. Once four memories are stored, the player can insert Teddy's right hand below the circular door to return to the player's house. In the extra DLC level, instead of exploring dreamlike locations, the player is taken to another house with the objective of finding and thawing five frozen dolls by playing music or turning on the TV. The gameplay is still the same, with the feminine figure haunting the player, but the player is also confronted by a fireplace monster in the underground section that advances and closes in through an aisle. Story Set in the 1990s, a toddler (whose name is David) is having his second birthday celebration at his home with his mother Zoey. The celebration is interrupted by a visitor at the front door who is hidden from David, but the story suggests it is the David's father Justin, with whom Zoey has divorced and run off with an actress. The conversation is muffled and partly kept from David as Zoey raises her voice, refusing Justin's request to see his child. Zoey's angry tone frightens David, whose fear is presented as blurred vision. Quickly, Zoey returns with a gift, but she doesn't say who the gift is from. Instead, she carries David and gift upstairs to the child's room, a place of bright, warm colors and streaming sunlight. Zoey briefly opens the gift, but looks at what is inside with a disdainful expression before quickly shutting the gift box. Before the present is given to David, the telephone rings, and Zoey leaves David in the bedroom to play alone. The gift is revealed to be a sentient teddy bear, who climbs out of the box and hides in the chest until David finds him. The bear introduces himself as Teddy. Teddy has a friendly, curious nature. After a few minutes playing together with a music box, a stuffed pink elephant, a story book, and a toy train, they go into the closet, which turns out to be a large, dark room filled with long, dark colored coats. Teddy says that if David gets scared in the dark, he can hug Teddy to feel more safe. Once David holds Teddy, he lights the way, acting like a flashlight. The small adventure is ended by Zoey finding them; she tells David, gently but ominously, to stop hiding from her and puts him to bed. David wakes in the night to find Teddy being taken by an unseen force. David's crib overturns, and he escapes. David leaves the bedroom and rescues Teddy from a washing machine by unplugging it and opening the door. Teddy says that something was not right and that they have to find Zoey. The search leads them to discover a slide that takes them to a small playhouse within a cavern that is presumably under the house, and the door found inside it leads them into a journey through several surreal environments, consisting of an underground playground, a dilapidated mansion that has merged with a marshy forest, and a bizarre series of caverns created by hundreds of closets. Teddy instructs David to find four memories he shared with Zoey that will lead them to her. The memories take the forms of four objects: Her pendant from her necklace shown at the start of the game, the music box she plays to put him to sleep at night, the story book, and the pink elephant. Throughout the search, David is pursued by a large, feminine, troll-like monster named Hyda and a creature with glowing white eyes named Heap, who has a coat as a body like the ones in David's closet earlier. After the last memory is found, Teddy and David try to go through the slide that would lead back to the playhouse, but Heap grabs onto Teddy to stop David from completing the last memory. David hangs over an abyss and Teddy's arm is ripped off in the weight of David. David then falls into a dark place lit by a series of floodlights. David follows Zoey's voice and sees her drinking from a bottle as she transforms into Hyda (implying that they and Heap are the same) before disappearing. David is left alone in the dark, with window lights coming from up ahead, leading him back to the playhouse. After using the last memory to open the playhouse's door, David sees cracks in a door that's straight ahead. Once through the door, David is back in his room (having exited through the closet). David heads downstairs to find Zoey crying in the kitchen, with the damaged Teddy in one hand, and an empty wine bottle in the other, which she drops. When David attempts to retrieve Teddy, Zoey knocks David over and shouts at him to leave her alone. She apologizes and tells David she didn't mean to, and that it's too much. David has the option of briefly comforting Zoey should he interact with her again. There is a knock at the front door that Zoey doesn't react to; instead, she continues crying. When David goes to the door, it opens and reveals a glowing white light. Justin is heard talking to David, remarking on Teddy's broken arm, stating that he can fix him. It is implied that Justin gains full custody of his child after this and the actress becomes a future stepmother. =Prologue= An expansion level available through downloadable content is set before the events of the main story, again told from David's point of view. David is wandering through a winter environment and finds five dolls surrounding a light that breaks, sending David to a house different from the one shown in the main story. David is required to locate and thaw the five dolls that are frozen due to the freezing wind from outside coming through the open windows, which involves closing the windows and using music and TV to free them. Throughout the house, bright figures of David's parents are shown arguing due to Zoey's alcohol abuse. Along the way, David encounters Hyda from the main story and a living furnace monster named Hons in the basement. Once David finds all of the dolls, including the rabbit one found outside the house after it has fallen from a window, Zoey is seen taking David before going away in depression, implying that the house is Justin's house and that Zoey is taking David to the house seen in the main story, leaving the doll out in the cold. =Alternate Ending= This 'bad ending' was scrapped from the story but was placed in the enhanced edition of the game. The ending can be accessed in the Museum level. David wakes up in a broken down, cage-like baby crib in an unknown area. Then he sees Teddy turning a wheel, where the crib is being held, revealing a room with lifeless dolls, all memory items and a giant cooking pot. The crib stops moving and Teddy walks creepily towards David, 'happily' greeting him. From that moment, his neck cracks and giant skeleton- like hands came out of his body, revealing his true ghostly form: \\"The Nightmare\\". It turns out the Nightmare has been using young children to collect beloved items to create a stew by disguising as stuffed toys and tricking children to venture far from their homes and to his hideout. He prepares his meal by placing all the items in the pot, stirring them, while saying the quotes from the toddler's book \\"Five Thirsty Animals.\\" He then congratulates David for doing his bidding, grabs him, and drops him into the boiling water ready to be devoured.

Life He was the second son of Bernard Gates, gentleman, of St. Margaret's, Westminster. His name appears in the list of children of the Chapel Royal in 1702. At the end of 1708 he was sworn a gentleman of the Chapel Royal in the place of J. Howell, who died on 15 July in that year. He held the sinecure office of tuner of the regals at court, and was a member of the choir of Westminster Abbey. At some time before 1732 Gates was made master of the children of the Chapel Royal. On 23 February 1732 Handel's Esther was performed at Gates's house in James Street, Westminster, by the children of the chapel. The same singers sang the work at a subscription concert at the Crown and Anchor Tavern, and again at the room in Villiers Street, York Buildings. In 1734 Gates seceded from the Academy of Vocal Music, taking the children of the chapel with him. He had been a prominent member of the society from its inauguration. Gates sang one of the airs in the first performance of the \\"Dettingen Te Deum\\" in 1743. John Hawkins states that says that Gates introduced into the Chapel the system of solmisation by hexachords. Death In 1737 (10 March) Mrs. Gates died, and in 1758 Gates moved to North Aston, Oxfordshire. He died there on 15 November 1773, and was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey on the 23rd of the month. The inscription on his monument, a source for his family information, gives his age as eighty-eight. A tablet to his memory was put up in the church of North Aston, at the expense of his pupil, Thomas Sanders Dupuis. Family Gates married before 1717, since on 6 June of that year his eldest child, a daughter named Atkinson, was buried in the north cloister of Westminster Abbey. This unusual Christian name, which was borne by another daughter of Gates (buried 1736), was derived from a Mrs. Atkinson, who had been laundress to Queen Anne, and who had brought up Mrs. Gates, and made her her heiress.

Life  Ali Shah, surnamed Shah Murad or Murad Mirza lived in Anjudan. He had also retained his close relations with Shah Ismail cemented by his father. His mode of living, his dress and food were characterised by a rare simplicity.http://www.ismaili.net/histoire/main.html He was a politically active Imam, possibly alongside the Nuqtavi Shia group, and had a large following.A Short History of the Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community, by Farhad Daftary, page 176. MurƒÅd Mƒ´rzƒÅ did not always operate from the Nizari base of Anjudan. As a result of his activeness, he acquired followers in Kashan and other central Persian areas. The Ottoman sultan Salim (1512-1520) began his long march to northern Azerbaijan after putting 40,000 Shias to death in his dominions. He reached the plain of Chaldiran and the outbreak of war occurred in 920/1514. He inflicted a defeat to Shah Ismail. The Ottoman firepower, consisting of 200 cannon and 100 mortars was brought into play with devastating effect. After suffering heavy casualties, the Safavid artilleries were forced to break off the engagement. When Shah Ismail left the battlefield, sultan Salim did not pursue him. Later, he marched to Tabriz, the Safavid capital, which he occupied in 922/1517. Caterino Zeno, the Venetian ambassador writes in \\"Travels in Persia\\" (p. 61) that, \\"If the Turk had been beaten in the battle of Chaldiran, the power of Ismail would have become greater than that of Tamerlane, as by the fame alone of such a victory he would have made himself absolute lord of the East.\\" Later, the Mamluks of Syria and Egypt similarly remained wedded to their cavalry, and were also defeated by the Ottomans. The effect of the Safavid defeat at Chaldiran was the loss of the province of Diyar Bakr, which was annexed to the Ottoman empire in 921/1516. Shah Ismail went into mourning after his defeat. During the remaining ten years of his reign, he never once led his troops into action in person. He did not devote his attention to the affairs of the state as in the past. On the contrary, he seems to have tried to drown his sorrows by wine. His abdication of his responsibilities in regard to the personal direction of the affairs of state gave certain officials the opportunity to increase their own power. The clash between the Kizilbash and the Iranian soldiers began to be a threat to the Safavid kingdom. Kizilbash were the Turkomans, who were distinguished for wearing red pointed caps, which they had begun to wear in the time of Shaikh Hyder (1456- 1488), the father of Shah Ismail; and thus they became known as Kizil-Bash (red heads), and in its Iranian form, Qizilbash, or Red Heads. They shaved their beards but let their moustaches grow. The Kizilbash constituted the backbone of the Safavid army. It seems probable on that juncture that Shah Ismail had generated a close tie with the Ismaili Imams in Anjudan, and granted them the title of Amir al-Umra. There is its another reason that the Ismailis had joined the Safavid army in Khorasan, who had repulsed the aggressive advance of the Uzbeks in 916/1510. Shah Ismail had most possibly planned to seek the martial aids from the Khorasani Ismaili warriors to crush the uprising in his military if required. He therefore, maintained cordial relation with the Imams of Anjudan. Shah Ismail however died in 930/1524. It is said that the Muharram was an ideal month for the Ismaili pilgrims visiting Anjudan. They carried usually a small taziyah (replica of Imam Hussain's tomb), and placed it in front of the caravan and passed through the teeth of the bitterest and aggressive places in the Shiite garbs. They put the taziyah at the entrance of Anjudan, and took it again while leaving the town. Imam Murad Mirza died in 920/1574 in Anjudan and was succeeded by his son Zulfikar Ali. = Capture and execution = In 1573, due to the threat posed by the Imam, the 2nd Safavid monarch, Shah Tahmasp, ordered the governor of Hamadan, Amir Khan Musilu, to go to Anjudan to capture Murad Mirza. Amir Khan proceeded to Anjudan, and while killing a large number of the Imam's followers and taking much booty, was unable to capture him. However, the Imam was soon captured and imprisoned, but again escaped, this time with the aid of a sympathetic high-ranking Safavid official named Muhammad Muqim. With the help of his followers, the Imam was able to escape to Kandahar. However, while in Afghanistan, he was once again captured by the Safavids. This time there would be no escape, and after being brought before Shah Tahmasp he was executed alongside Muhammad Muqim in 1574.The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines, by Farhad Daftary, page 472.Historical Dictionary of the Ismailis, by Farhad Daftary, page xxxiii.A Short History of the Ismailis: Traditions of a Muslim Community, by Farhad Daftary, page 176.

Retrieved on December 10, 2017. This shows the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station as outside the city limits. The Cheyenne Mountain Complex, an underground facility on Cheyenne Mountain AFS, was first built for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) Combat Operations Center, though NORAD moved day-to-day operations to its headquarters on Peterson AFB in 2006. However, day-to-day operations were moved back in 2011 after a major overhaul and renovation. The location now supports U.S. Strategic Command's Missile Warning Center, other strategic warning and survivable capabilities, and provides a ready alternative operating location for NORAD's command center.  Background  Until 2006, Cheyenne Mountain was the center for the United States Space Command and NORAD which monitored the air space of Canada and the United States through a worldwide system for early warnings of missiles, space systems, and foreign aircraft. The operations center was moved from an above-ground facility, vulnerable to missile or bomber attack, to the \\"granite shielded security\\" within Cheyenne Mountain during the Cold War as the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The complex was built in the mid-1960s, began operations in 1966, and NORAD's Combat Operation Center was fully operational on February 6, 1967. Today the Air Force Station is used as a crew training center and is skeleton crewed and maintained as an alternate command center. It has its own power plant, heating and cooling system, and water supply. The underground complex was built under of granite within five acres of excavated tunnels. Structures outside of the military complex include the parking lots and roads, an old heliport, and the fire station. Outdoor facilities include Mountain Man Park, picnic areas, a racquetball facility, softball field, sand volleyball, basketball, a putting green, and horseshoes. There is a fitness center inside and outside the mountain. The portals for the blast tunnel are entered off the parking lot. The Air Force is responsible for all of NORAD Road, to Hwy 115, but has permitted local residents to access the road with motorized vehicles only per an easement agreement between the Air Force and City of Colorado Springs. A military gate limits NORAD Road usage past the residential turn-off just west of the State Highway 115 interchange. The military complex has, in the past, included many units of NORAD, U.S. Space Command, Aerospace Defense Command, Air Force Systems Command, Air Weather Service, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The complex's communication center is also used by the nearby U.S. Civil Defense Warning Center. The station has an exercise, weights, and cardio gym that is open 24 hours a day. United States Space Force units are under the command of the 21st Space Wing at Peterson Air Force Base. Colorado Springs has a number of military installations. The others are Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Air Force Academy. and Schriever Air Force Base.  Air Force Space Command  The entire installation at Cheyenne Mountain was designated the Cheyenne Mountain Air Station by February 1995. In 2000, the installation was renamed Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. That year all Air Force Space Command Air Stations in the United States have been redesignated as Air Force Stations. At one time, the Air Force Station was the site of NORAD's Air Defense Operations Center. That function, along with other day-to-day NORAD operational missions moved to the NORAD and USNORTHCOM headquarters building on Peterson Air Force Base. 21st Space Wing emblem Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station is supported and operated by the 21st Space Wing, which is headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base and under the command of 14th Air Force and Air Force Space Command. In addition to supporting Peterson Air Force Base, the wing conducts operation space missions such as operating missile warning radar and cataloging objects in space for the U.S. Strategic Command. Those operational missions are managed by the 21st Operations Group. The 21st Space Wing operates radar systems in the United States and worldwide, monitoring for launches of ballistic missiles and new space systems up to above the earth. As of 2014, there are at least 20 countries able to launch long-range weapons, including chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Cheyenne Mountain AFS force support and logistics services are provided by the 21st Mission Support Group at Peterson AFB. All other support such as equipment and facilities, including the Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) weapon system, are operated and maintained by the 721st Mission Support Group of the 21st Space Wing. The 721 Mission Support Group is located at Cheyenne Mountain. The 721st Civil Engineering Squadron operated from 1966. Under Col. Joseph Turk, 721st Mission Support Group Commander at the time, it was reactivated, reversing a 2004 action where its functions were outsourced. The last active duty commander was Lt. Col. Todd Wynn, who is now retired. It was re-activated on July 17, 2012, bringing some of the functions in-house under civilian employees. The civil engineering squadron is responsible for the engineering, maintenance, and operation of the complex. In 2006, the Space Control Center, the command and control hub for space surveillance in the United States, transferred its operations to the newly created Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) from Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. The JSpOC belongs to United States Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component for Space (JFCC SPACE); it is not part of NORAD or U.S. Northern Command. The Air Force Space Command support remained at the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station under the 21st Space Wing's 721st Mission Support Group. Global warning functions within the complex include the North American Aerospace Defense Command/U.S. Northern Command's Alternate Command Center, U.S. Strategic Command's Missile Warning Center, the 721st Global Strategic Warning/Space Surveillance System Center of the Integrated Tactical Warning/Attack Assessment system. The Missile Warning Center, a directorate under USSTRATCOM's JFCC Space, was upgraded in June 2011, upon completion of a $2.9 million project over 18 months. It was funded by USSTRATCOM and resulted in newer computers, more efficient workspace, a new knowledge visual display, new joint worldwide intelligence communication systems, and a new electronic procedural checklist. Tons of debris built up at the entrance to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station following heavy rainfall and a resulting rock slide in September 2013. The 4th Infantry Division, with support by the 615th Engineer Company, 52nd Engineer Battalion, of Fort Carson cleared away the debris from a rockslide and uprooted trees. The storm and resulting debris did not limit the Air Force Station's operations, according to the 721st Mission Support Group's commander Col. Travis Harsha, who became commander on July 11, 2013 for the now retired Col. Joseph Turk. On September 5, 2013, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station hosted an event with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), local sheriffs and police chiefs, Army security forces, and Air Force security across several military installations about partnering for law enforcement and emergency management events, like terrorist threats, criminal activity, and forest fires. Partnering with law enforcement and the community helps to \\"foster information sharing and maximize joint training opportunities,\\" according to Col. Travis Harsha, the CMAFS installation commander and 721st Mission Support Group Commander. On 20 December 2019, Air Force Space Command was redesignated as the U.S. Space Force and elevated to become an independent military branch.  Cheyenne Mountain  The facility is adjacent to the Cheyenne Mountain State Park. A telecommunication antenna farm is located on the highest point and Pike National Forest is on the west side of the mountain. The mountain is also the site of the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun.

Schmitz.In the introduction to Baen's edition of Agent of Vega by Schmitz, Lackey states that his book was an epiphany for her, and inspired her to write The book uses the same characters as the original novel, and starts about where the original ended. The story describes how Captain Pausert is found to have klatha (psionic) powers that increase over the course of the story, where he is called a witch, a \\"hot witch\\", and finally a wizard.In the context of this story, the term witch refers to male or female. Hot witch indicates a powerful witch, while wizard indicates someone who had abilities that few, if any, witches possess. Plot summary After safely arriving at the planet Emris at the end of the previous story, Captain Pausert is asked to transport the Nartheby sprite Hantis on an important mission so that she can meet with the Empress. Accompanying him is Goth, the Leewit, Hulik do Eldel, and Vezzarn from the original story, along with Pul, Hantis' talking grik-dog. They quickly learn that several groups are after them, presumably attempting to learn the secret of their Sheewash drive,The Sheewash drive is a psionic propulsion mechanism that was introduced in \\"The Witches of Karres\\". It can reach speeds far in excess of normal transportation methods. which they have used when they need to escape from a difficult situation. They eventually learn that their mission is to prevent a plague of nanites from taking control of people. They are being hunted by the ISS (secret service) which is under the influence of the nanites, the remaining gang of Agandar the pirate who is after the drive, and Sedmon, the Daal of Uldune (a planet that caters to pirates and others who have covert needs) who is also after the drive. They land on Vaudevillia, a planet for carnivals, and join up with Petey, Byrum and Keep, \\"The Greatest Show in the Galaxy.\\" Eventually Agandar's lieutenant catches up with them, and is killed in a sword fight during a Shakespearian play. The Daal of Uldune arrives shortly later, reveals that he has been trying to help them, agrees to fund the carnival, and travels with them. At one point, Pausert and his group (except Hulik) separate from the carnival and are taken back in time to meet one of Hantis' ancestors. The same nanite plague is happening in that time period, and Pausert is able to stop the plague from spreading. Upon returning to their own time, they are able to meet the empress and stop that plague as well. Pausert learns that the witches of Karres deliberately did not teach him how to use his klatha powers because he had the inherent ability to exceed their capabilities if allowed to learn on his own.

The game is a remake of the original Rise of the Triad: Dark War published by the former Apogee Software in 1995. Gameplay The gameplay has been touted as a throwback to classic first-person shooters of the 1990s such as the original Rise of the Triad. It features non-linear level design, a high rate of player movespeed, multiple playable characters and an arsenal of over the top explosive weaponry recreated from the original game. The game consists of 20 levels (plus four secret levels) spread across four episodes as well as an online multiplayer component which features Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and Capture the Flag game modes. Plot The plot is nearly identical to that of the original Rise of the Triad: Dark War wherein a team of special operatives, known as the H.U.N.T. (High-risk United Nations Task-force) is sent to San Nicolas Island to investigate terrorist activity taking place. When their boat is destroyed by patrols, the team soon learns that the 'Triad' cult plans to nuke nearby Los Angeles. The operatives, now unable to return from whence they came, are left to fight their way into the heart of the island to put a stop to the Triad's activities once and for all. Development Development of Rise of the Triad began in January 2012. Originally planned as an HD remake, Slipgate Studios instead decided to assemble a global virtual team to begin a full re-imagining of the original. The game's producer Leon Zawada had previously worked on a pseudo-sequel fan game called Return of the Triad for the ZDoom engine.Mod showcase: Return of the Triad (20 Oct 2015) - NAG Magazine The game was revealed for the first time at QuakeCon 2012 and released one year later at QuakeCon 2013. It is said development was completed on an extremely tight budget and that much of said budget went toward acquiring licenses for Rise of the Triad IP and Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. Reception Rise of the Triad received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. PC Gamer UK commented: \\"Everything that you loved and hated about the 1994 original‚Äîludicrous gibs, explosives, boss fights, and first-person platforming.\\" IGN: \\"It's a relic from the early age of shooters that, while authentic, is so entrenched in outdated design and mechanics that it's more frustrating than it is fun.\\" Destructoid: \\"It stays true to the original with its design philosophy and retention of some of the original assets, but it also brings modern conveniences to the forefront without all the pay to win or over-saturated downloadable content nonsense.\\" Notes # # # # # # # # References External links * * Category:2013 video games Category:3D Realms games Category:Apogee games Category:First- person shooters Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in Denmark Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in California Category:Video games using PhysX Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Steam Workshop games ","title":"Rise of the Triad (2013 video game)"},{"id":"36661318","text":"Commodore Cicero Price (2 December 1805 - 24 November 1888) was an officer in the United States Navy.

Development The Polen Special, (Also known as the Polen Special II) development started in October 1967 by Dennis Polen and Darryl Usher. The project to build a fast single seat racer larger than Formula One limitations began as a retractable gear Midget Mustang modification. After reviewing engine installation shortcomings, a clean sheet design was started. The Polen Special was then designed around a Piper Comanche engine and cowling, which also had design issues with engine canting and required cowling modifications for a single engine installation. A new clean sheet Lycoming IO-360 installation came afterward. Two sets of retractable landing gear were built and tested, but were sold to other homebuilders. Over time, the RayJay turbocharger was removed due to hunting and composite ailerons were installed. The aircraft was sold by Polen to Richard C. Keyt and has been modified several times to increase efficiency and safety. A composite rudder replaced the all-metal rudder that fluttered to destruction at 2500 engine RPM and a modern turbocharger was installed. Keyt and partner Jack Zimmanck formed the Polen Company to develop aircraft technologies with the Polen Special as a flying testbed. A design modification called the \\"Stage 3\\" is underway incorporate further improvements. Design The Polen Special is a low-wing monoplane with retractable conventional landing gear. The retractable gear is hydraulically operated from a T-33 sequencing valve with electric powered gear doors. The fuselage and wings are all aluminum with flush riveting. The ailerons and elevators use push-pull tubes, with cable control for the rudders. The aircraft is specifically designed to fly at high altitude on IFR routes with the pilot using supplemental oxygen to achieve maximum speed with the turbocharged engine.

The film, Andjar's directorial debut, follows a nurse and her superior as they fall in love in the Air Raid Preparation team. Produced by The Teng Chun's New Java Industrial Film, Kartinah was heavily subsidised by the country's government and through product placement. Although it was a critical failure, the new actors signed with the studio for Kartinah gave New Java Industrial Film increased production capabilities. Plot Suria (Astaman), a commander at the Air Raid Preparation team (, or LBD), has fallen in love with the nurse Kartinah (Ratna Asmara), who serves with the LBD. However, he is married to Titi (Tante Han), a woman who has lost her sanity. Although Suria's uncle (R. Inoe Perbatasari) suggests that Suria take Kartinah as a second wife, Kartinah refuses, as she considers herself a modern woman and not bound by traditional practices. In an airstrike, Titi is heavily wounded; the presence of danger jolts her mind enough that she regains her sanity. She explains that she and Suria have long been sleeping in different beds, and expresses hope that Kartinah will be willing to take him as her husband. Kartinah and her childhood friend, Dr. Rasyid (Rasjid Manggis), try unsuccessfully to save Titi's life. Afterwards Kartinah agrees to marry Suria. Production Andjar Asmara, who directed Kartinah, had previous experience as the editor-in-chief of the film magazine Doenia Film (1929‚Äì1930) and dramatist for the theatrical group Dardanella. He was invited to direct by The Teng Chun, an ethnic Chinese film producer and head of Java Industrial Film; Andjar also wrote the film's script. Several cast members were drawn from the Dardanella troupe, including Astaman, Ali Joego, and M. Rasjid Manggis, while R. Inoe Perbatasari had formerly worked with Andjar's troupe Bollero. Kartinah was Andjar's directorial debut and the film debut of several of its actors. An advertisement for Kartinah on the cover of D'Orient, 23 August 1941 Andjar and his wife, Ratna, were each given 1,000 gulden for their work, Andjar as director and Ratna as an actress. The couple also received a 10 per cent share of the net profits. This fee, twice that earned by stars for other studios, was made possible by a subsidy from the LBD. Funds from the LBD and Department of Internal Affairs were also used in production, allowing for the filming of expensive effects and scenes, including one with a large fire and the first airstrike in the country's cinema. Despite this, the Indonesian sociologist A. Budi Susanto notes that the film put its love story first, leaving the role of the LBD in the background. Further funds were drawn from product placement: a Singer sewing machine and two local magazines. Kartinah was originally meant to be titled Kartini. However, this proved controversial owing to the title's reminiscence of the female emancipation figure, Kartini. Filming began in early 1940 and received the attentions of numerous local groups, who visited the set. The film was in black-and-white. Release and reception Kartinah was released in late 1940, during a time of increased intellectualism in local films. Although audiences had high expectations, the academia were later critical of the film; they considered it as nothing more than entertainment, not having any educational value. However, the influx of new talent led Java Industrial Film to expand into different areas, creating subsidiaries for action and mystery films. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Life Du≈°an Zbavitel studied Indology with Professor Vincenc Lesn√Ω at Charles University in Prague in 1945‚Äì1948. After defending his CSc (Candidate of Sciences) dissertation in Bengali literature (1954), he started as a researcher at the Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. He remained there until being forced out for political reasons in 1971 during the period of Communist \\"normalization\\" that followed the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. After 1971, he worked as a freelance translator, and in 1978 he started as a teacher of Sanskrit and Bengali at the School of Languages in Prague. He was active as an author and translator until the last days of his life. He translated from Sanskrit, Pali, Bengali, English and German. Literary oeuvre Zbavitel specialized in Bengali literature, winning international acclaim in this field. His most quoted literary works include a study of East Bengal folk ballads (Bengali Folk Ballads from Mymensingh and the Question of their Authenticity) and a comprehensive history of Bengali literature (\\"Bengali Literature\\") published in 1976 in the prestigious publication History of Indian Literature edited by Jan Gonda. In addition to these monographs, the international research community has praised Zbavitel's numerous magazine articles (of which he wrote more than 100) such as a series of papers on Rabindranath Tagore, the beginnings of modern Bengali drama and studies of baromasi, a specific genre of medieval and folk Bengali literature. Zbavitel's prominence in this field is highlighted by his appointment first as a team member for the project The Dictionary of Oriental Literature and then as editor-in-chief of its second volume devoted to south Asian literature, which was published in London in 1974. Zbavitel is the Czech Republic‚Äôs best known Indologist. He published a prolific amount despite being out of favor with Czechoslovakia's totalitarian regime. He authored or co- authored many specialized and popular books and initiated and edited a great number of collective works that still represent the best of Czech Indology. Zbavitel left an indelible trace on Czech culture with his erudite translations from the languages of India, amounting to dozens of books and countless magazine and journal contributions. Zbavitel educated several generations of Czech Indologists. While still just a researcher at the Oriental Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he taught Bengali at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University (1950‚Äì1968). He was not permitted to continue for political reasons after 1968, and was only able to return after the fall of the Communist regime (1989). In 1990, he rejoined the faculty, teaching the history of Sanskrit and Bengali literature, ancient Indian poetry and Hinduism and leading courses in the advanced reading of Sanskrit and Bengali texts. He also authored language textbooks and other pedagogical texts. Zbavitel also translated from English and German. In total, he wrote or translated over 200 books, among others: Paul Williams and Anthony Tribe, Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition; Michael Jordan, Buddha; Deepak Chopra, Buddha: A Story of Enlightenment; Tom Lowenstein, The Vision of Buddha; Hans K√ºng and Heinrich von Stietencron, Christendum und Weltreligionen - Hinduismus; Hans K√ºng and Heinrich Bechert, Christendum und Weltreligionen - Buddhismus; Dalai Lama, The Collected Statements, Articles and Interviews of His Holiness The XIV Dalai Lama; Dalai Lama, How to Expand Love; Dalai Lama, Many Ways to Nirvana; Dalai Lama, How To Practice the Way to a Meaningful Life; John Powers, Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism; Michael Keene, World Religions; Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying; J. R. Porter, Jesus Christ, The Jesus of History, The Christ of Faith; Jacob Newman and Gavriel Sivan, Judaism A-Z Illustrated: Lexicon of Terms & Concepts. Awards and honors Zbavitel received many awards at home and in India for his research and translations. He received the Tagore Memorial Award from the Government of West Bengal for his History of Bengali Literature in 1977, the title Lokaratna for his contribution to folklore research (1981) and the Rabindratattvacharya award for his studies on Rabindranath Tagore (1987). In 2006, he received India's third highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan, for his lifetime achievements.India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Padma Awards Directory (1954‚Äì2010) His Czech and Czechoslovak awards included the State Award for Translated Work in 2004.PREINHAELTEROV√Å, Hana. \\"Du≈°an Zbavitel obdr≈æel st√°tn√≠ cenu za p≈ôekladatelsk√© d√≠lo\\".

Chanfrau. It is one of the landmarks of that century's American genre of border drama.  Creation  Chanfrau conceived a drama to star himself, and in 1868, he paid $300 to Edward Spencer, generally understood to have been for fulfilling (under the title Down the Mississippi) Chanfrau's commissioning of such a work.Roger A. Hall, Performing the American Frontier, 1870-1906, pp. 20, 44, Cambridge University Press, 2001 Thomas B. DeWalden did further work on the play, and it opened in Buffalo, N.Y. in the first third of 1869. (By that time it had the title that names the lead character, offering the publicity benefit of evoking the decades-old fiddle tune \\"The Arkansas Traveler\\" and a dialogue of the same sort that had generally been associated with the tune; both of those are indeed features of the version that would be taken to New York City.) It was poorly received, however, and Chanfrau prevailed on his friend, theatrical entrepreneur Clifton W. Trayleure, to make further revisions. The New York opening in May 1871, giving author credit to Spencer and DeWalden, was successful, and he logged some 300 performances across the country, generally crediting either Spencer alone, or Spencer and Trayleure jointly.  Plot  In the drama, Chanfrau played the hero Kit Redding. His wife and daughter are kidnapped by the villain, a frontier outlaw, in a prologue, or First Act. Between acts, years pass (depending on the performance, 12 years, 20, or perhaps other intervals), including the Civil War, and Kit mourns but grows rich. In four remaining acts, he * encounters the renamed villain in a hotel, but fails to recognize him; * foils the villain's attempt to cheat him at poker aboard a river steamer; * is recognized by the daughter (who makes him aware of the wife's death and the villain's former identity) and fights the villain on the steamer's deck; and * pursues the villain ashore, kills him, and is reunited with the daughter.

Delaware, 503 U.S. 159 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court decision that ruled that a person's rights of association and due process, as granted under the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, cannot be infringed upon if such an association has no bearing on the case at hand.  Background  Early in the morning of December 1, 1986, David Dawson and three other inmates escaped from the Delaware Correctional Center at Smyrna. Dawson stole a car and headed south, while the other escapees stole another car and headed north. After burglarizing one home in Kenton, Dawson entered the home of Richard and Madeline Kisner. Dawson tied up Mrs. Kisner, who was at home alone preparing for work, and stabbed her 12 times before taking her car and some money. He was found the next day sleeping in a different stolen car in Milford. The Delaware Superior Court found Dawson guilty of first-degree murder and several other crimes on June 24, 1988.US District Court Information Order, Civil Action No. 96-300-RRM Retrieved August 12, 2012 During the penalty phase, the prosecution planned to present evidence that Dawson belonged to the prison's chapter of the Aryan Brotherhood, including expert testimony about that group, to prove that Dawson's membership was relevant to his crimes. Eventually, Dawson agreed to a stipulation that the Aryan Brotherhood was a white racist group that had its roots in a California prison gang of the same name, in return for the exclusion of expert testimony about the group. The jury concluded that the aggravating factors in the case, including Dawson's prison record, his escape from prison, the fact that he committed the murder adjunct to a second felony, and his association with the Aryan Brotherhood outweighed the mitigating factors and sentenced him to death. The Supreme Court of Delaware upheld the death sentence.  Opinion of the Court  In writing the Court's opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that the Constitution does not erect a per se barrier to the admission of evidence of a person's beliefs and associations during sentencing simply because those beliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment. Chief Justice Rehnquist cited Barclay v. Florida, , for which he had written the Court's opinion as an Associate Justice, as a case where such beliefs were material in establishing the murderers' motives. In Barclay, Elwood Barclay and four other black men, looking to start a race war, killed white hitchhiker Stephen Orlando in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, in 1974. The Supreme Court of Florida imposed the death penalty on Barclay and co-defendant Jacob John Dougan. In 1985, however, the court reversed itself by ordering that Barclay's sentence be commuted to life in prison with eligibility for parole in 25 years and that Dougan be re-sentenced.Florida Supreme Court Overturns Death Sentences In Racial Murder Retrieved November 13, 2012 Dougan was sentenced to death again in 1987 and remains on Florida's Death Row.Florida Department of Corrections Information on Jacob John Dougan, Retrieved May 26, 2013 Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that because of the narrowness of the stipulation regarding the Aryan Brotherhood that the Delaware trial court agreed to ‚Äì that is, because the trial court did not seek to provide evidence that the chapter Dawson was associated with was engaged in or endorsed racist activities, or was engaged in or endorsed any other violent or unlawful acts ‚Äì it violated Dawson's rights under both the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Chief Justice Rehnquist also noted that even if the Aryan Brotherhood chapter did hold racist beliefs, elements of racial hatred were absent in this case. Both Dawson and Kisner, the woman he murdered, were white. The Court vacated the sentence against Dawson and remanded the case. = Concurrence = In his concurrence, Justice Blackmun agreed with the Court's opinion, but specifically noted that the Court did not require harmless error review on remand. In the next-to-last paragraph of the Court's opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted that the question of harmless error was not before the Court with regard to the admission of the Aryan Brotherhood stipulation. Justice Blackmun agreed with Rehnquist that the issue of harmless error was best left for Delaware to consider. = Dissent = In his dissent, Justice Thomas declared that he believed the Aryan Brotherhood stipulation spoke directly to Dawson's character, and as such the stipulation had relevance at sentencing as an aggravating factor. Justice Thomas noted that even if the prosecution did not introduce specific evidence of the Aryan Brotherhood chapter's activities, the jury could reasonably conclude that Dawson had engaged in some sort of illegal or forbidden activities during his membership in the gang. Justice Thomas cited a 1985 report from the U.S. Department of Justice about prison gangs to illustrate their deviant nature,Prison Gangs: Their Extent, Nature and Impact on Prisons, July 1985, U.S. Department of Justice Retrieved May 25, 2013 and the U.S. Court of Appeals case Jones v. Hamelman (7th Cir. 1989) to illustrate that expert testimony was unnecessary to describe a prison gang once its existence was noted.Jones v. Hamelman, 869 F. 2d 1023 (7th Cir. 1989) - a case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Retrieved January 20, 2013. Justice Thomas believed that the Court was imposing a double standard on the prosecution in this case and future cases by allowing Dawson to present mitigating character evidence during sentencing without explaining such evidence explicitly while not allowing the prosecution to do the same. Chief Justice Rehnquist acknowledged Justice Thomas's points in the opinion. He wrote that while the state was certainly free to submit aggravating evidence, the stipulation in and of itself could not be viewed as \\"bad\\" character evidence in its own right. Chief Justice Rehnquist went further by noting:  Aftermath  Upon re-sentencing, David Dawson was sentenced to death a second time on April 2, 1993.

Actually part of Balfin Group are more than 18 companies; geographically the Group is present in 7 countries, employing more than 5,000 people. Biography Mane was born in the southern Albanian city of Kor√ßa on 24 December 1967. He was a student of the Faculty of Geology and Mining at Tirana University when the communist system in Albania collapsed. In this new social, economical and political situation he emigrated in Austria looking for a better life. Mane started working as a translator. Whilst living in Austria in 1993, he spotted the opportunity to start business with electronic products and home appliances in Albania. In 2008 he was included in the Financial Times top four \\"people to watch in business\\" in Albania. Mane's net worth is estimated to be around 700 million euros. Alba Trade and Neptun The beginnings of Mane's business activities started in 1993 in Vienna, where Mane founded Alba Trade. Having started with the trade of electronic devices, soon the Balfin Group, created by Mane managed to create the largest network of electronics stores in Albania, Neptun and then extending the network in the neighboring countries as well. Today this business created by Mane counts 28 stores in Albania and more than 27 in Kosova, Montenegro, Macedonia and Serbia.http://www.oranews.tv/vendi/neptun-me-dyqan-te-ri-tek-cristal-center- oferta-per-te-gjithe-te-interesuarit/ https://balkanweb.com/rrefehet-samir- mane-biznesmeni-me-i-pasur-ne-shqiperi-si-e-bera-milionin-e-pare/ Mane TCI Since 2002 Balfin Group is present in development and real estate management projects. Through the company Mane TCI it has realized industrial and residential facilities of the highest standards in Albania such as Rolling Hills, Ambasador 1, 2, 3, etc, or the well known shopping centers such as TEG or QTU. QTU, Euromax, Fashion Group In 2005, it was inaugurated the first shopping center in Albania, Qendra Tregtare Univers (Universe Trade Center). This was a very ambitious project of Mane's for the time and revolutionized the purchasing way of the Albanian customers. a. The year 2005 marked the establishment of the first Albanian chain of supermarkets, Euromax. Fashion Group was established in 2005. TEG In 2011 Balfin Group completed another important project, Tirana East Gate. With an investment of ‚Ç¨54 million, it was constructed the most modern and the largest shopping center in Albania with over 90'000 m2. Skopje City Mall, Honorary Consul of Thailand, Tirana Logistic Park In October 2012 Balfin Group concluded one of the most important investments of the group abroad, Skopje City Mall. In March 2012 he was named the honorary consul of Thailand at the opening ceremony of the new consulate. Again during 2012 Mane with Balfin Group undertook a project yet again, building a logistic park. The total investment costs are planned to be about ‚Ç¨44 million. AlbChrome In 2013 Balfin Group took a step to diversify the portfolio of activities in the mineral industry by acquiring 100% of the shares of the largest company of extraction, enrichment and processing of chrome in Albania.  Green Coast  In 2015, Mane started building, Green Coast, containing ten types of buildings, from villas to apartments, including a 5 star hotel.  Spar and Interspar  In 2016 Mane and Balfin Group turned all the Carrefour in Albania, into Spars and Interspars. This is a Dutch brand, founded on 1932 and is currently present in more than 42 countries around the world.  NewCo Ferronikeli and Tirana Bank  2018 was a successful year for Mane and Balfin Group, where they announced the acquisitions of NewCo Ferronikeli, the integrated nickel mine and smelter based in Drenas, Kosovo. Immediately after the purchase they injected sufficient funds to restart the plant and bring it back to full production, as well on agreeing to repay the existing supplier debts of the company and paying outstanding salaries. Another major transaction was the acquisition of Tirana Bank in cooperation with Komercijalna Banka from Macedonia, where Balfin Group holds around 90% of the shares. Controversy Samir Mane has been subject to strong controversy from Albanian activists and his business competitors, due to his success and strong economic influence within the country and in the region. What remains true and official is the fact that Samir Mane and his group, BALFIN Group, has never participated in so far in public tenders nor benefiting from public budget. This is also reflected onto the group development trend and its portfolio diversification strategy.

Through the centuries, the guitar has continued to be one of the most important and cherished instruments in Cuba, both in the practice of popular music as well as in the classical music tradition. Founded by renowned professors such as Clara Romero, Isaac Nicola, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola, Carlos Molina (guitarist), and Marta Cuervo River√≥n, the Cuban guitar school has acquired an excellent international reputation since the 20th century, represented by important instrumentalists and composers such as Leo Brouwer, Carlos Molina (guitarist), Jos√© Rey de la Torre, Juan Antonio Mercadal and Joaqu√≠n Clerch, among many others. From the 16th to the 19th century The guitar (as we know it today or in one of its historical versions) has been present in Cuba since the discovery of the island by Spain. As early as the 16th century, a musician named Juan Ortiz, from the village of Trinidad, is mentioned by famous chronicler Bernal D√≠az del Castillo as ‚Äúgran ta√±edor de vihuela y viola‚Äù (a great performer of the ‚Äúvihuela‚Äù - a guitar ancestor - and the viol). Another ‚Äúvihuelista‚Äù, Alonso Mor√≥n from Bayamo, is also mentioned in the Spanish conquest chronicles in the 16th century.Giro, Radam√©s. Leo Brouwer y la guitarra en Cuba. Editorial Letras cubanas. La Habana, Cuba, 1986. p. 17 During the 17th century, Seraf√≠n Ramirez mentions a guitarist named Juan Navarro; and in 1722 we find small groups of guitars and ‚Äúbandolas‚Äù in Santa Clara to entertain the population. We also find around this period of time some groups composed by guitars, ‚Äúbandolas‚Äù, flutes and ‚Äúp√≠fanos‚Äù in Santiago de Cuba, which performed during the festivities of San Juan and Santiago Ap√≥stol.[Giro, p. 18 - 19] At the end of the 17th century (around 1680) Lucas P√©rez de Ala√≠z, a guitarist from Burgos, Spain, served as Chapel Master of the Santiago de Cuba Cathedral.[Giro, p. 18] Domingo and Bartolom√© Tam√© offered lessons of guitar, singing and violin from 1819 to 1820 in Santiago de Cuba, where also professors Manegat and Bisb√©, from Barcelona, taught guitar and singing. In the same city, the Catalan musician Juan Casamitjana offered guitar and singing lessons between 1832 and 1836, and guitarists Francisco Peralta and Juan Antonio Betancourt (disciples of Manegat) acquired great reputation. Also Fabricio Calzado Portuondo became famous as a guitarist and singer in Santiago de Cuba.[Giro, p. 20 ‚Äì 21] A disciple of famous Spanish guitarist Dionisio Aguado, Jos√© Prudencio Mungol was the first Cuban guitarist trained in the Spanish guitar tradition. In 1893 he performed at a much acclaimed concert in Havana, after returning from Spain. Mungol actively participated in the musical life of Havana and was a professor at the Hubert de Blanck conservatory. Other Cuban guitarists from the 19th century are: Joaqu√≠n Inciarte (Santiago de Cuba) and Fernando Costa (Camaguey).[Giro, p. 23 ‚Äì 24] The 20th century and beyond Severino L√≥pez was born in Matanzas. He studied guitar in Cuba with Juan Mart√≠n Sabio and Pascual Roch, and in Spain with renowned Catalan guitarist Miguel Llobet. He also studied musical composition in Barcelona. After returning to Cuba he founded a music academy in Havana, which he abandoned to establish his permanent residence in Santiago de Cuba. L√≥pez composed many pieces and numerous transcriptions for the guitar, including one of the famous ‚ÄúLa Comparsa‚Äù of Ernesto Lecuona. He was the professor of renowned Cuban guitarists Jos√© Rey de La Torre and Vicente Gonz√°lez-Rubiera (Guy√∫n). Severino L√≥pez is considered the initiator in Cuba of the guitar school founded by Francisco T√°rrega in Spain.Orovio, Helio. Cuban Music from A to Z.Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK, 2004. Other important Cuban guitarists from the first half of the 20th century were Ezequiel Cuevas,[Giro, p. 36] Francisqueta Vallalta and F√©lix Guerrero (Sr.).[Giro, p. 40] Clara Romero (1888‚Äì1951), founder of the modern Cuban School of Guitar, studied in Spain with Nicol√°s Prats and in Cuba with F√©lix Guerrero. She inaugurated the guitar department at the Havana Municipal Conservatory in 1931, where she also introduced the teachings of the Cuban folk guitar style. She created the Guitar Society of Cuba (Sociedad Guitarr√≠stica de Cuba) in 1940, and also the ‚ÄúGuitar‚Äù (Guitarra) magazine, with the purpose of promoting the Society's activities. She was the professor of many Cuban guitarists including her son Isaac Nicola and her daughter Clara (Cuqui) Nicola.[Giro, p. 41 -43] After studying with his mother, Clara Romero, at the Havana Municipal Conservatory, Isaac Nicola (1916‚Äì1997) continued his training in Paris with Emilio Pujol, a disciple of Francisco T√°rrega. He also studied the vihuela with Pujol and researched about the guitar's history and literature.[Giro, p. 53 - 54] After returning to Cuba, Nicola engages on a period of performing activity which concludes in 1957, with a concert where he premiered the famous Danza Caracter√≠stica by Leo Brouwer.[Giro, p. 55] From now on, he devotes himself entirely to teaching, assisted by other dedicated collaborators, such as professors Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola (his own sister) and Marianela Bonet.[Giro, p. 56]Ram√≠rez, Marta Mar√≠a. Cuba: The Cuban Guitar School. SEMlac reports 7. Gramatges, Harold. Presencia de la Revoluci√≥n en la m√∫sica cubana. Editorial Letras cubanas. 1983. P. 79. Nicola proceeded to restructure his mother's method and also added much of his own. He established the basis for a comprehensive guitar didactical system that, including the contribution of many others, was going to be applied to the academic formation of several generations of Cuban guitarists. Two other important Cuban guitarists from that period of time were: Jos√© Rey de la Torre (1917‚Äì1944) and Juan Antonio Mercadal (1925‚Äì1998). Both of them traveled extensively as guitar performers and established themselves in the US. Rey de la Torre settled in California, while Mercadal became a resident of Miami, Florida, where he founded the Guitar School at the University of Miami. The modern Cuban Guitar School After the Cuban revolution in 1959, Isaac Nicola and other professors such as Marta Cuervo, Clara (Cuqui) Nicola, Carlos Molina (guitarist), Marianela Bonet and Leopoldina N√∫√±ez were integrated to the national music schools system, where a unified didactical method was implemented. This was a nucleus for the later development of a national Cuban Guitar School with which a new generation of guitarists and composers collaborated. Leo Brouwer. Maybe the most important contribution to the modern Cuban guitar technique and repertoire comes from Leo Brouwer (b. 1939). The grandson of Ernestina Lecuona, sister of Ernesto Lecuona, Brouwer began studying the guitar with his father and after some time continued with Isaac Nicola. He taught himself harmony, counterpoint, musical forms and orchestration before completing his studies at Juilliard School and Hartfod University. According to renowned Venezuelan guitarist Alirio D√≠az, ‚ÄúBrouwer is an important part of this process, of the creation of today‚Äôs music, for which he has opened new ways and introduced the avant-garde in the guitar [technique and repertoire].‚Äù [Giro, p. 77] Other guitarists that collaborated with the foundation of the modern Cuban Guitar School are: Jes√∫s Ortega (b. 1935) and Idelfonso Acosta (b. 1939).Gonz√°lez Rubiera, Vicente. La guitarra y su t√©cnica. Editorial Letras Cubanas. La Habana, Cuba, 1985. The Cuban guitarist El√≠as Barreiro, established in the United States since 1966, has developed an important career as a performer and professor at Tulane University, New Orleans. Leo Brouwer has defined the modern Cuban Guitar School as follows: ‚ÄúThe Cuban Guitar School is the sum of technical elements, a repertoire and a sensibility from the guitarists and creators toward this instrument, the guitar.‚Äù [Giro, p. 121] The new generations Renowned Cuban guitar professor Isaac Nicola surrounded by his disciples. From left to right Flores Chaviano, Efra√≠n Amador, Carlos Molina, Mario Daly, Armando Rodr√≠guez Ruid√≠az, Roberto Kessel and Jos√© Angel P√©rez Puentes. Since the 1960s, several generations of guitar performers, professors and composers have been formed under the Cuban Guitar School at educational institutions such as the Havana Municipal Conservatory, the Escuela Nacional de Artes (National Art Schools (Cuba)), and the Instituto Superior de Arte. Other guitarists, such as Manuel Barrueco, a concertist of international renown, developed their careers outside the country. Among many artists related to the Cuban Guitar School, we can mention the following names: Carlos Molina (guitarist), Sergio Vitier, Efra√≠n Amador Pi√±ero and Flores Chaviano, as well as: Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, Mart√≠n Pedreira, Lester Carrodeguas, Mario Daly, Jos√© Angel P√©rez Puentes and Teresa Madiedo.

Meet the artists and musicians Gerardo Perez Capdevila, Joaqu√≠n Clerch Yalil Guerra and Al√≠ Arango. Compositions for guitar Numerous Cuban composers, many of them guitarists themselves, have contributed to create a body of work that may support the didactic and aesthetic efforts of the Cuban Guitar School. Before 1959, some composers such as Amadeo Rold√°n, Jos√© Ard√©vol, Joaqu√≠n Nin Culmell, Natalio Gal√°n and Harold Gramatges began composing music for the classical guitar. Apart from Leo Brouwer, that may be considered the most important Cuban composer for the guitar during the 20th and the 21st century, other composers have also written original compositions, didactical music and transcriptions for the instrument. A list of composers may include:Carlos Fari√±as, Jes√∫s Ortega, Nilo Rodr√≠guez, Flores Chaviano, Efra√≠n Amador Pi√±ero, Armando Rodriguez Ruidiaz, Jos√© Angel P√©rez Puentes, Mart√≠n Pedreira, Julio Roloff and Yalil Guerra.

In 1910, the Benson Mines Company bought the site from the Magnetic Iron CompanyShampine, ‚ÄúDays of Ore.‚Äù and continued operations on and off until 1918.Hall, Gem of the Adirondacks, 28. At the onset of World War II, Benson Mines reopened when Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation leased the site. The U.S Department of Defense built ore processing facilities and the iron-ore was shipped to Pittsburgh for use in the war effort.Shampine, ‚ÄúDays of Ore.‚Äù The mining operation expanded significantly in the 1950s, and was renamed the New York Ore Division, although control remained in the hands of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation.Hyde, Adirondack, 176. At its height, the company employed 840 workers in 1960.Hall, Gem of the Adirondacks, 45. With the economic prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s the Company took a leading role in community development. The company published a magazine called Men and Steel, which provided ‚Äúgeneral information about different parts of the plant‚Ä¶ *as well as+‚Ä¶personal interest stories, *and+ weddings births, deaths, anniversaries, and other family news‚Ä¶‚Äù In 1952, the magazine highlighted the Company‚Äôs financial contributions to town projects, which included construction of the Central School building, water system, housing project, and hospital. Mining Gatehouse of the former Benson Mines, 1991 by Philip G Coman The ore body at Benson Mine is composed of magnetite and non-magnetite ore. The average percentage of iron in both magnetite and non-magnetite ore was about 23%, less than the 40% at Chateauguay. Iron-ore deposits that contained 50% or more iron were depleted in the United States by the mid-1940s. The ability to concentrate ‚Äúnon-magnetite ores by gravity processes‚Äù at Benson mines ensured its economic expansion because these processes enabled lower grade iron ore to be used in steel-making.Hall, Gem of the Adirondacks, 95. In 1952, a gravity plant was built, which allowed non- magnetic ore to be processed on site. Ore was extracted using open pit mining methods. Holes were bored in the ground and filled with explosives. ‚ÄúAbout two gross tons of crude ore‚Ä¶ *were produced+ per pound of explosive used.‚Äù A four ton ball on a crane smashed the ore into smaller pieces, which were then loaded onto a dump truck and transported to the Coarse Crushing Plant, which broke the ore into pieces three-inches in diameter. A conveyor belt then took the ore to the Fine Crushing Plant, which reduced it in size to ‚Äúone and one- half inch in diameter.‚Äù The ore was sometimes crushed into even smaller pieces of ‚Äúfive eights of an inch‚Äù before it was sintered, concentrated, and transported to steel manufacturing centers. Sintering merges ore with coke so it is easier to process in steel facilities. On average, the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation shipped about 1 million tons of iron ore sinter each year to steel plants in Pittsburgh and Aliquippa, PA, and Cleveland, OH using the New York Central Railroad. Trains left from the Watertown Junction, traveled to the Benson Mine to pick up ore, returned to Watertown, and then continued on to Syracuse, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Ohio. The iron from Benson Mines was used in the steel production for Chrysler cars.Hall, Gem of the Adirondacks, 9. The process of open pit mining, which eliminated the need for costly underground mining, and ‚Äúthe relative softness of the rock, which simplified crushing and extraction‚Ä¶‚Äù served to the mine‚Äôs advantage; however, the ‚Äúlow iron-content of the ore‚Ä¶*and+‚Ä¶the remoteness of the mine from navigable water, necessitating relatively costly rail transportation‚Äù eventually hampered the mine‚Äôs financial success. Also, increasing pressure from foreign competitors, which were selling duty-free iron-ore products to the United States, caused the entire U.S steel industry to decline and collapse throughout the 1960s. Closing of Mine The Benson Mine was a staple of the local economy. It employed hundreds of workers and supported over 1,900 people near the end of its operations. The mine also paid over 400,000 dollars each year in taxes, which helped to maintain local infrastructure and services. When the Benson Mine closed in August 1978 more than 365 people lost their jobs, and Star Lake slipped sharply into economic decline. The number of students enrolled in local schools dropped from 1,400 in 1978 to 625 the following year.Hall, Gem of the Adirondacks, 9.

He was the brother of General-Adjutant Huseyn Khan Nakhchivanski and father of Major General Jamshid Nakhchivanski. Early life and military career Jafargulu Khan was born into a princely family of Nakhchivanski, descending from the rulers of the Nakhchivan Khanate. His father was a Major General of the Russian Imperial army and his mother was the daughter of the khan of Maku. In 1867, young Jafargulu was signed up for the Page Corps. Upon graduating in 1877, he was promoted to cornet in Her Majesty's Uhlan Life Guard Regiment based in Peterhof. In April 1878, he was sent to a regiment stationed in the Caucasus and participated in the Russian occupation of Erzurum during the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878). In the later years, he participated in Central Asian campaigns of the Russian army, after which he was promoted to Staff captain. For his participation in these military operations, he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus (third degree, 1880), Order of Saint Vladimir (fourth degree, 1881) and Order of Saint Anne (third degree, 1882), as well as medals in commemoration of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 and for the siege of Geok Tepe.

Political activity Following the disintegration of the Russian Empire, Azerbaijan and Armenia, now both independent, quarrelled over the region of Nakhchivan. When in December 1918 it became clear that the British Chief Commissioner Sir John Oliver Wardrop's peace plan would assign Nakhchivan to Armenia instead of Azerbaijan, Nakhchivanski initiated an Azeri revolt, leading to the proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Aras, composed of the former uyezds of Nakhchivan, Sharur- Daralagez and Surmali, with its capital in the city of Nakhchivan.Dr. Andrew Andersen, Ph.D. Atlas of Conflicts: Armenia: Nation Building and Territorial Disputes: 1918-1920 Nakhchivanski became the head of the new republic, which in essence was de facto controlled by Azerbaijan.

There it clashed with regular Azerbaijani troops, which reinstalled Azerbaijan's control over the city within a month. On 10 August 1919, the Armenians were forced to sign a peace treaty.Armenian-Azerbaijani Military Conflicts in 1919-20.

S. Reddy under the Gayatri Films banner and directed by Sarath. It stars Nandamuri Balakrishna, Ramya Krishna, Sakshi Shivanand, Krishnam Raju in the lead roles and music composed by Koti. Plot Suryam (Nandamuri Balakrishna) is a physical director in a local college and lives with his mother Varalakshmi (Raadhika), a widow. The college in which Suryam works belongs to an Industrialist called Sudarshan Rao (Charan Raj). Sudarshan Rao is the brother-in-law of the business magnate Rajagaru (Krishnam Raju). Rajagaru has two sons, Anand (Brahmaji) and Ashok (Ravi Babu). Sudarshan Rao has a son, Srikanth (Srihari) and a daughter, Surekha (Sakshi Shivanand). Surekha is a student in the college. Satya (Ramya Krishna) works as a junior PD (Physical Director) in the same college. Suryam and Surekha used to have regular fights. After a few days, they fall in love. Satya too loves Suryam. When they visit 'Khajuraho' on a college tour, Satya implicates Suryam that he tried to rape her. After a couple of scenes, we come to know that Sudarshan Rao inducted Satya into the college to malign the image of Suryam so that his daughter Surekha hates Suryam in that process. Later on, we come to know that Satya is the daughter of a conspirator (Giri Babu). She is asked to play the trick on Suryam in order to save her ailing father. Sudarshan Rao agrees for the marriage of Suryam and Surekha. But he wants to know why the mother of Suryam is appearing as a widow even though her husband is alive. Suryam caught unawares with this question, as he is not aware that his father is alive. Later on, Suryam comes to know that Rajagaru is his father. Suryam's mother used to work as a maid in Rajagaru's house. When Rajagaru gets involved in a murder of a thief, she takes up the responsibility and gets ready to go to the jail. Moved by the unconditional sacrifice done by his maid, Rajagaru marries his maid. Sudarshan Rao, the brother-in-law of Raja, makes sure that the maid is thrown out of the house by doing manipulations. The maid comes out of the house and raises her child, Suryam. After knowing the flashback, Suryam decides to go back to his father and win his laurels and thereby set the house right.

The church stood at the top of a hill at the western edge of the village. It had a short rectangular nave and a narrow polygonal chancel walled on three sides. It was probably built in the first half of the 17th century. According to Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, the main altar was dedicated to the Holy Cross and the side altars to the Virgin Mary and Saint Margaret. After 1840 it became a vicariate to Zdihovo. The belfry was probably added at this time and a bell cast in 1844 was installed. The church still stood in 1950, but like many other churches in the region it was destroyed between 1953 and 1954. The church was also surrounded by a cemetery. Today only the threshold of the church and the remnants of a few gravestones remain.Ferenc, Mitja. \\"≈†krilj: Podru≈æniƒçna cerkev sv.

Xiao Ai and Xiao Xin are offered an old house by her doctor where unexplainable events begin to happen. Plot A struggling novelist, Xiao Ai, has her horror novel rejected by her publisher. When her publisher notifies her that her husband, Qi Kun, who was imprisoned on charge of domestic abuse, has been released from prison, Xiao Ai decides to pack things up and move alongside her asthmatic son, Xiao Xin to a remote mansion owned by her friend and Xiao Xin's doctor, Yinan. Xiao Ai finds several cut-out photos of a girl and her mother inside a wardrobe, while Xiao Xin discovers a rag doll outside the mansion and takes an instant liking to it. Xiao Ai feels that ever since her son took the doll, the girl who is presumably the owner of the doll terrorizes her and makes Xiao Xin acts unnatural, though he claims that the girl is afraid of her abusive mother. During one of her attempts to write a draft, Xiao Ai finds that a story has been written in her laptop, seemingly by no one, and which updates itself every day. The story matches the tale told by Xiao Xin: a girl who was abused by her mother after her father left them. Despite repeated attempts to dispose of the doll, it always materializes back and returns to Xiao Xin's possession. The hauntings grow increasingly violent and malevolent, with Xiao Ai becoming even more paranoid and worried because of Xiao Xin's claims about the girl and her mother, until one day, Xiao Xin goes missing. Yinan calls the authorities to search for Xiao Xin. Xiao Ai also learns that the previous occupants of the mansion were a girl and her mother as per the story, and that the mother killed her daughter and herself when she could not take the pains of her husband leaving her. However, a rumor goes that the girl escaped the incident alive and was brought up in an orphanage. During the search, Qi Kun manages to reach the mansion and demands that Xiao Ai tells him the whereabouts of their son until Yinan stops him. Qi Kun informs Yinan that he had researched of Xiao Ai's background and learned that she was raised in an orphanage while being diagnosed with amnesia and asthma. Xiao Ai, meanwhile, sustains a head injury and is taken to the hospital by Yinan and Qi Kun, but along the way the car crashes off. Xiao Ai heads back to the mansion immediately. At the mansion, Xiao Ai stumbles upon Qi Kun's researches. It is revealed that the girl who haunts Xiao Ai is in fact Xiao Ai herself and that Xiao Ai, deranged because of her own mother's abuses when she was young, is really the one who had abused Xiao Xin, but her bouts of amnesia meant that the only suspect of the abuses was Qi Kun, even though he only wanted to protect his son. She had also unknowingly wrote the story in her laptop, again because of her amnesia. Xiao Ai is led by her younger self to a secret room behind the wardrobe, where her mother hanged herself years before. She agrees to her younger self's demands to stay at the mansion in exchange for revealing where Xiao Xin is. After saving him, she attempts to escape the mansion but is almost strangled by her mother's spirit until she calls her \\"mother\\" for the first time since she never did it before, after which the spirit disappears. Several months later, Xiao Ai has moved to the mansion permanently. She gives a monologue that her mother and son had taught her to understand her family, which led to her mother forgiving herself. A younger Xiao Ai is seen walking to the wardrobe where she is forcibly taken by her mother inside. Cast *Mei Ting as Xiao Ai *Ma Shuliang *Wu Chao as Qi Kun *Zhu Jiangdi as Xiao Xin *Guo Jingfei as Yinan *Gao Xinyu Style Derek Elley of Film Business Asia commented that outside the fact that the characters were speaking Mandarin, that the film \\"looks exactly like a South Korean one ‚Äî from its clean-looking shooting style, photography, editing, music and even immaculate wardrobe ‚Äî and with its remote setting could just as well have been shot in South Korea as well.\\" The Chinese title of the film translates to a type of ouija board game using a pen, but no such item appears in the film. Release Bunshinsaba was released in China on July 12, 2012. The film grossed RMB32.0 million (US$5.01 million) in the first seven days of its theatrical run. Since the film's release, director Ahn Byeong-ki has become the first South Korean director to set up his own workshop (ByungKi An China Studio) in Mainland China. The film ended its theatrical run grossing RMB61 million (US$9.93 million). The film was followed up with a sequel Bunshinsaba 2 in 2013 and Bunshinsaba 3 in 2014.

Three unidentified gunmen killed 19 people, including the church's pastor. The following day, in an apparent reprisal killing, three gunmen on motorcycles killed two soldiers and a civilian outside a mosque in Okene. Background Boko Haram, an Islamic terrorist group whose goal is to institute sharia law throughout Nigeria, has become more active and more skilled in carrying out attacks since clashes with security forces in 2009. Since then, it has claimed responsibility, or been blamed for, numerous attacks on Nigerian government and civilian targets. Most attacks have been in the primarily Muslim north of Nigeria, though the group's name has been used to claim other bombings, such as the attacks against the United Nations headquarters and the main police building in the capital city of Abuja. The group itself has since splintered, with some members allied to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and some expecting terms of agreement similar to southern Nigeria's MEND. Shootings =Church shooting= The attack took place on 7 August 2012, at the Deeper Life Bible Church in the town of Otite, which is on the outskirts of the city of Okene in Kogi State. Three men, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, entered the church as a Bible study session was about to begin. One of the men switched off the generator that provided lighting in the church. The other two men then fired into the darkness with their assault rifles. Fifteen people were killed outright and four more died later from their wounds. No group claimed responsibility for the shooting. Although the Islamist group Boko Haram has attacked Christian churches before, the attack was further south than the group's usual area of operations. =Mosque shooting= On 8 August, three gunmen on motorcycles shot dead two soldiers outside a mosque in Okene. A civilian was also killed by crossfire. The soldiers were on patrol outside the mosque and were fired upon at the end of a prayer session. Reactions As the attacks occurred around Okene, on the border between Nigeria's mostly Christian south and mostly Muslim north, they were described as \\"worrying\\" for religious tensions in Nigeria. Security forces were deployed to the area and national police chief Mohammed Abubakar ordered 24-hour surveillance on all churches and mosques in Kogi State's central area. Nigerian soldiers and police officers searched for the gunmen through the night following the shooting. Idris Wada, the Governor of Kogi State, announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew in parts of the state. He said, \\"The perpetrators of the heinous crime are wicked, devilish, ungodly and deserve no place in a sane society. But they will not get away with it this time. We will spare no resource at our disposal to fish out the perpetrators and smoke terrorism out of our state.\\" Wada also visited the Ohinoyi of the Ebira people to express displeasure at the situation in his territory.  Investigation  Residents of the Okene area alleged that in the days following the shooting, police had conducted house- to-house searches, beating a number of civilians. Some citizens were reported to have fled the city. A police spokesman denied any violence had taken place. Several former politicians from the Okene area were brought to Lokoja for questioning related to the attacks. On 9 August, police announced that they had arrested two men and one woman suspected of perpetrating the church shooting. The three were reportedly arrested following a gunfight with police in Ibillo, Edo State.

A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database. Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created. History In 1983, the American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic money called ecash. Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash, an early form of cryptographic electronic payments which required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before it can be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by the issuing bank, the government, or any third party. In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: the Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a Cryptocurrency system, first publishing it in an MIT mailing list and later in 1997, in The American Law Review (Vol. 46, Issue 4). In 1998, Wei Dai published a description of \\"b-money\\", characterized as an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system. Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold. Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange, BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system which required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published. The first decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was created in 2009 by presumably pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, as its proof-of-work scheme.Bitcoin developer chats about regulation, open source, and the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto , PCWorld, 26 May 2013 In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS, which would make internet censorship very difficult. Soon after, in October 2011, Litecoin was released. It was the first successful cryptocurrency to use scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Another notable cryptocurrency, Peercoin was the first to use a proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid.Wary of Bitcoin? A guide to some other cryptocurrencies , ars technica, 26 May 2013 On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had been commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies, and what role, if any, they can play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered. Formal definition According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions: # The system does not require a central authority, its state is maintained through distributed consensus. # The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership. # The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units. # Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically. # The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units. # If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them. In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. =Altcoin= The term altcoin has various similar definitions. Stephanie Yang of The Wall Street Journal defined altcoins as \\"alternative digital currencies,\\" while Paul Vigna, also of The Wall Street Journal, described altcoins as alternative versions of bitcoin. Aaron Hankins of MarketWatch refers to any cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin as altcoins. =Crypto token= A blockchain account can provide functions other than making payments, for example in decentralized applications or smart contracts. In this case, the units or coins are sometimes referred to as crypto tokens (or cryptotokens). Architecture Decentralized cryptocurrency is produced by the entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is defined when the system is created and which is publicly known. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency by printing units of fiat money or demanding additions to digital banking ledgers. In the case of decentralized cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units, and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks or corporate entities which hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which decentralized cryptocurrencies are based was created by the group or individual known as Satoshi Nakamoto. , over 1,800 cryptocurrency specifications existed. Within a cryptocurrency system, the safety, integrity and balance of ledgers is maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners: who use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme. Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.\\"How Cryptocurrencies Could Upend Banks' Monetary Role\\". , American Banker. 26 May 2013 Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement. This difficulty is derived from leveraging cryptographic technologies. =Blockchain= The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is \\"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\\". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority. Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain. The public nature of the blockchain ledger protects the integrity of whatever is being transacted since no one entity owns the database. The added work required to solve the encryption in a proof-of-stake system ensures that the public ledger is not modified at random, thus solving the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server to administer the database, assuming no 51% attack (that has worked against several cryptocurrencies). Timestamping Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \\"prove\\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party. The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt. Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof- of-work include CryptoNight, Blake, SHA-3, and X11. The proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme. =Mining= mine In cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and Scrypt. This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since the day the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was introduced in 2009. With more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for this validation has become far more complex over the years, with miners having to invest large sums of money on employing multiple high performance ASICs. Thus the value of the currency obtained for finding a hash often does not justify the amount of money spent on setting up the machines, the cooling facilities to overcome the heat they produce, and the electricity required to run them. , bitcoin's electricity consumption is estimated to about 7 gigawatts, 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to that of Switzerland. Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A \\"share\\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of- work. , the Chinese Government halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. Some Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada. One company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites, due to low gas prices. In June 2018, Hydro Quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 MW to crypto companies for mining. According to a February 2018 report from Fortune, Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity. In March 2018, the city of Plattsburgh in upstate New York put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the \\"character and direction\\" of the city. GPU price rise An increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017. (The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes.) Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock. A GTX 1070 Ti which was released at a price of $450 sold for as much as $1100. Another popular card GTX 1060's 6 GB model was released at an MSRP of $250, sold for almost $500. RX 570 and RX 580 cards from AMD were out of stock for almost a year. Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPU's as soon as they are available. Nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners. \\"Gamers come first for Nvidia,\\" said Boris B√∂hles, PR manager for Nvidia in the German region. =Wallets= An example paper printable bitcoin wallet consisting of one bitcoin address for receiving and the corresponding private key for spending A cryptocurrency wallet stores the public and private \\"keys\\" or \\"addresses\\" which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet. =Anonymity= Bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous in that the cryptocurrency within a wallet is not tied to people, but rather to one or more specific keys (or \\"addresses\\"). Thereby, bitcoin owners are not identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users. Additions such as Zerocoin, Zerocash and CryptoNote have been suggested, which would allow for additional anonymity and fungibility. =Fungibility= Most cryptocurrency tokens are fungible and interchangeable. However, unique non- fungible tokens also exist. Such tokens can serve as assets in games like CryptoKitties. Economics Cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside existing banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet. =Block rewards= Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances. The rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate public blockchain. Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they further must consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution. Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case. The current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities. Some sources claim that the current bitcoin design is very inefficient, generating a welfare loss of 1.4% relative to an efficient cash system. The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be 360 Million USD per year. This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. However, the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether. =Transaction fees= Transaction fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction. The currency holder can choose a specific transaction fee, while network entities process transactions in order of highest offered fee to lowest. Cryptocurrency exchanges can simplify the process for currency holders by offering priority alternatives and thereby determine which fee will likely cause the transaction to be processed in the requested time. For ether, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit. In September 2018, the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to $0.017, while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.55. Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism. =Exchanges= Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies. =Atomic swaps= Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange. =ATMs= Bitcoin ATM Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.First U.S. Bitcoin ATMs to open soon in Seattle, Austin , Reuters, 18 February 2014 =Initial coin offerings= An initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S., and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \\"investment contract\\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \\"tokens\\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or ether. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used Switzerland as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. The Swiss regulatory agency FINMA stated that it would take a \\"balanced approach\\" to ICO projects and would allow \\"legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\\" In response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ICO working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices.R Atkins (Feb. 2018). Switzerland sets out guidelines to support initial coin offerings . Financial Times. Retrieved 26 May 2018. Legality The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. According to the Library of Congress, an \\"absolute ban\\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in eight countries: Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. An \\"implicit ban\\" applies in another 15 countries, which include Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Iran, Kuwait, Lesotho, Lithuania, Macau, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \\"bitcoin scams\\" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions. Various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoin differently. China Central Bank banned the handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in China in early 2014. In Russia, though cryptocurrencies are legal, it is illegal to actually purchase goods with any currency other than the Russian ruble.Bitcoin's Legality Around The World , Forbes, 31 January 2014 Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems. Cryptocurrencies are a potential tool to evade economic sanctions for example against Russia, Iran, or Venezuela. Russia also secretly supported Venezuela with the creation of the petro (El Petro), a national cryptocurrency initiated by the Maduro government to obtain valuable oil revenues by circumventing US sanctions. In August 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). =Advertising bans= Cryptocurrency advertisements were temporarily banned on Facebook, Google, Twitter, Bing, Snapchat, LinkedIn and MailChimp. Chinese internet platforms Baidu, Tencent, and Weibo have also prohibited bitcoin advertisements. The Japanese platform Line and the Russian platform Yandex have similar prohibitions. =U.S. tax status= On 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. This means bitcoin will be subject to capital gains tax. In a paper published by researchers from Oxford and Warwick, it was shown that bitcoin has some characteristics more like the precious metals market than traditional currencies, hence in agreement with the IRS decision even if based on different reasons.On the Complexity and Behaviour of Cryptocurrencies Compared to Other Markets, 7 November 2014 In July 2019, the IRS started sending letters to cryptocurrency owners warning them to amend their returns and pay taxes.https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-has-begun-sending-letters-to-virtual- currency-owners-advising-them-to-pay-back-taxes-file-amended-returns-part-of- agencys-larger-efforts =The legal concern of an unregulated global economy= As the popularity of and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009, so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.ALI, S, T; CLARKE, D; MCCORRY, P; Bitcoin: Perils of an Unregulated Global P2P Currency [By S. T Ali, D. Clarke, P. McCorry Newcastle upon Tyne: Newcastle University: Computing Science, 2015. (Newcastle University, Computing Science, Technical Report Series, No. CS-TR-1470) Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money. Money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers, however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least provide a proven identity. Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track. Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions. =Loss, theft, and fraud= In February 2014 the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declared bankruptcy. The company stated that it had lost nearly $473 million of their customers' bitcoins likely due to theft. This was equivalent to approximately 750,000 bitcoins, or about 7% of all the bitcoins in existence. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February.Mt. Gox Seeks Bankruptcy After $480 Million Bitcoin Loss , Carter Dougherty and Grace Huang, Bloomberg News, 28 February 2014 Two members of the Silk Road Task Force‚Äîa multi-agency federal task force that carried out the U.S. investigation of Silk Road‚Äîseized bitcoins for their own use in the course of the investigation.Sarah Jeong, DEA Agent Who Faked a Murder and Took Bitcoins from Silk Road Explains Himself , Motherboard, Vice (25 October 2015). DEA agent Carl Mark Force IV, who attempted to extort Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht (\\"Dread Pirate Roberts\\"), pleaded guilty to money laundering, obstruction of justice, and extortion under color of official right, and was sentenced to 6.5 years in federal prison. U.S. Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges pleaded guilty to crimes relating to his diversion of $800,000 worth of bitcoins to his personal account during the investigation, and also separately pleaded guilty to money laundering in connection with another cryptocurrency theft; he was sentenced to nearly eight years in federal prison.Nate Raymond, Ex-agent in Silk Road probe gets more prison time for bitcoin theft , Reuters (7 November 2017). Homero Josh Garza, who founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately brought a civil enforcement action against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold \\"investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated\\" from mining.Cyris Farivar, GAW Miners founder owes nearly $10 million to SEC over Bitcoin fraud , Ars Technica (5 October 2017). On 21 November 2017, the Tether cryptocurrency announced they were hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from their primary wallet. The company has 'tagged' the stolen currency, hoping to 'lock' them in the hacker's wallet (making them unspendable). Tether indicates that it is building a new core for its primary wallet in response to the attack in order to prevent the stolen coins from being used. In May 2018, Bitcoin Gold (and two other cryptocurrencies) were hit by a successful 51% hashing attack by an unknown actor, in which exchanges lost estimated $18m. In June 2018, Korean exchange Coinrail was hacked, losing US$37 million worth of altcoin. Fear surrounding the hack was blamed for a $42-billion cryptocurrency market selloff. On 9 July 2018 the exchange Bancor had $23.5 million in cryptocurrency stolen. The French regulator Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF) lists 15 websites of companies that solicit investment in cryptocurrency without being authorised to do so in France. =Darknet markets= Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road. The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000. Darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the U.S., bitcoins are labelled as \\"virtual assets\\". This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets. Reception Cryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes and economic bubbles,Analysis of Cryptocurrency Bubbles . Bitcoins and Bank Runs: Analysis of Market Imperfections and Investor Hysterics. Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Retrieved 24 December 2017. such as housing market bubbles. Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were \\"nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it\\", and compared them to the tulip mania (1637), South Sea Bubble (1720), and dot-com bubble (1999). The New Yorker has explained the debate based on interviews with blockchain founders in an article about the ‚Äúargument over whether Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the blockchain are transforming the world‚Äù. While cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on financial security.Cryptocurrency and Global Financial Security Panel at Georgetown Diplomacy Conf , MeetUp, 11 April 2014 Regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken concrete regulatory measures to dissuade users. Additionally, many banks do not offer services for cryptocurrencies and can refuse to offer services to virtual-currency companies. Gareth Murphy, a senior central banking officer has stated \\"widespread use [of cryptocurrency] would also make it more difficult for statistical agencies to gather data on economic activity, which are used by governments to steer the economy\\". He cautioned that virtual currencies pose a new challenge to central banks' control over the important functions of monetary and exchange rate policy.decentralized currencies impact on central banks , RT√â News, 3 April 2014 While traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place, there is no intermediary with the power to limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen.Four Reasons You Shouldn't Buy Bitcoins , Forbes, 3 April 2013 One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards, for example, is consumer protection against fraud, such as chargebacks. Cryptocurrency mining consumes significant quantities of electricity and has a large associated carbon footprint. In 2017, Bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 948MW, equivalent to countries the scale of Angola or Panama, respectively ranked 102nd and 103rd in the world. Bitcoin, Etherum, Litecoin, and Monero were estimated to have added 3 to 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere in the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017. By November 2018, Bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, rivalling nations like Jordan and Sri Lanka. There are also purely technical elements to consider. For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software.Want to make money off Bitcoin mining? Hint: Don't mine , The Week, 15 April 2013 Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This prevents the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets.Keeping Your Cryptocurrency Safe , Center for a Stateless Society, 1 April 2014 The cryptocurrency community refers to pre-mining, hidden launches, ICO or extreme rewards for the altcoin founders as a deceptive practice. It can also be used as an inherent part of a cryptocurrency's design. Pre-mining means currency is generated by the currency's founders prior to being released to the public. Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, has repeated numerous times that it is a bubble that will not last and links it to Tulip mania. American business magnate Warren Buffett thinks that cryptocurrency will come to a bad ending. In October 2017, BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink called bitcoin an 'index of money laundering'. \\"Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,\\" he said. =Academic studies= In September 2015, the establishment of the peer- reviewed academic journal Ledger () was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh. The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers. =Aid agencies= A number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including the American Red Cross, UNICEF, and the UN World Food Program. Cryptocurrencies make tracking donations easier and have the potential to allow donors to see how their money is used (financial transparency). Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation said that UNICEF would uphold existing donor protocols, meaning that those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to UNICEF.UNICEF launches Cryptocurrency FundUnicef now accepting donations through bitcoin and ether See also * 2018 crypto crash * Blockchain-based remittances company * Crypto-anarchism * Cryptocurrency bubble * Cryptocurrency exchange * Cryptographic protocol * List of cryptocurrencies * Virtual currency law in the United States References Further reading * * External links * Category:Financial technology Category:Decentralization Category:Uberisation Category:Applications of cryptography ","title":"Cryptocurrency"},{"id":"36662231","text":"Un soir au club is a 2009 French film directed by Jean Achache based on the novel of the same name Un soir au club by Christian Gailly.

He is most notably the author of more than twenty books and of more than forty films, including S√©rie Noire au Credit Lyonnais (now known as LCL), Elf, une Afrique sous influence, l‚ÄôOrchestre Noir and FBI ¬´ les routes de la terreur 911 ¬ª which were broadcast by Arte. Career Calvi was involved in the birth of the newspaper Lib√©ration, where he specialized in foreign policy. From 1976, he covered social movements and terrorist groups in Italy. By the late 1970s, he followed the Mafia wars in Sicily and witnessed the birth of the anti-Mafia pool of the court of Palermo. From his many visits to Sicily, he wrote two bestsellers, La Vie Quotidienne de la Mafia and L‚ÄôEurope des Parrains, both of which have been translated into ten languages, and a dozen documentary films such as La Parade des Saigneurs and Familles Macabres. In 1979, he also handled major investigations for Liberation. He signed one of the first investigations on the Islamist atomic bomb with a BBC team that then made a film and a book entitled The Islamic Bomb. He also published revelations about the role played by France in a vast traffic of uranium from Namibia which was in direct violation of a UN resolution. In 1981, Calvi published his first major paper at Grasset \\"Camarade P.38\\" which focuses entirely on the blood trail of a gang of young killers of journalists in Milan during its \\"ann√©es de plomb\\". This book, the fruit of his Milanese years, is probably one of his more personal books. He was crowned in 2009 by a special mention at the Cesco Tomaselli Prize in Italy. From 1983 to 1984, he was the editor in chief in charge of major investigations and cases at the Matin de Paris. He published, among other documents, revelations about arms trafficking and drug use in the Balkans (investigation taken up by the daily La Republica that led to a documentary played on Antenne 2). After leaving the Matin de Paris, he published two books on the secret services, including the OSS la guerre secr√®te en France pendant la seconde guerre mondiale, book based on the comparison of records declassified by the CIA, on the unpublished testimonies of former French, English or American OSS agents and on the testimonies of the German secret agents responsible for tracking them (Abwehr). Calvi has since then been pursuing a dual activity as a book writer of \\"non-fiction\\" books and an author of documentary films. Fabrizio Calvi interviewed judge Paolo Borsellino on 21 may 1992, two day before the Capaci massacre As part of a film that to date has not been released, on the relationship between the Mafia and the Italian media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, he made an interview with the judge Paolo Borsellino that today is seen as a landmark. Two months after this interview, Paolo Borsellino was killed by the Mafia. Made public by the weekly L'Espresso in 1994 on the eve of the first election victory of Silvio Berlusconi, the transcript of the interview provoked strong reactions in Italy. Since 2000, a pirated version of a rudimentary editing of this interview has been broadcast by RAI and circulates on the Internet (where it has been seen by over six hundred thousand users). The full version of this exceptional document was released in Italy in December 2009 on DVD by the newspaper Il fatto quotidiano. His participation in nine films on the secret services during World War II allowed Calvi to work with Igor Barrere and Pierre Desgraupes. His collaboration with Jean-Michel Meurice led to a dozen of films about the Mafia, a series on the Credit Lyonnais scandal, S√©rie noire au Cr√©dit Lyonnais, and another series on the Elf affair including the widely acclaimed movie Elf une Afrique sous influence. His investigation on black terrorism in Europe during the Cold War led to two films, including L'orchestre noir which was broadcast by Arte and the Italian RAI. His knowledge of American archives led him to revisit some of the darkest chapters of World War II. He published and co-directs Pacte avec le Diable, book and movie devoted to American intelligence and the Holocaust. Written with Marc Mazurovsky from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, Le Festin du Reich draws an inventory of the ruthless economic pillage of France by the Germans.Le Monde blogs: Fabrizio Calvi: ¬´ le chiffre total du pillage de la France est sans doute plus proche des 1 200 milliards d‚Äôeuros d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui ¬ª (21 May 2014) Between 2007 and 2010, he worked on a vast fresco of the FBI. This work resulted in a book published by Fayard in late January 2010 and in five films released by France 5. His latest work focuses on the actions that led to the terrible events of September 11, 2001.

Since 2013 he works with SEPT.info, magazine and website based in Switzerland. SEPT.info is one of the few media to publish very long surveys. The freedom of tone, the curiosity of his team, his openness to new media and experiments have reinforced this choice. His first series was his 1992 investigation of Berlusconi's relationship with the mafia. Other topics covered for SEPT.info included lengthy behind-the-scenes investigations of the September 11‚Äôs attacks, Snowden before Snowden (3 long formats), Switzerland's Spy Nest (11 episodes), The Mystery Jimmy Hoffa (three articles) ); FBI against Martin Luther King, The FBI's secret war against Hackers, The mafia against journalists in Italy, The plunder of Charlie Hebdo and the mental illness in Bali.

It is the fictional story of five ordinary people (a sports shooter, a gangster, a policeman, a businessman, and head of a private security firm) who band together in order to assassinate the man responsible for the massacre of innocent civilians in Gwangju in May 1980. Plot The story deals with one of the most tragic and critical events in South Korean history. On May 18, 1980, in the city of Gwangju, state troops were ordered to open fire on civilians, killing and wounding thousands. Former president Chun Doo-hwan is believed to have given the order, and although he is not named explicitly in the film, the target of the assassination attempt is clearly meant to represent Chun, who was convicted in 1996 of crimes related to the Gwangju Massacre, but later pardoned by President Kim Dae-jung. 26 years later in 2006, five people who consider themselves as some of the biggest victims of the massacre, plot a top-secret project to exact revenge by assassinating the man responsible. Kwon Jung-hyuk is a newly recruited policeman who lost his family in the massacre; he is now responsible for the cars that have access to the target's house. Kwak Jin-bae is a young gangster from an organized crime group whose father was also killed. Olympic sharpshooter Shim Mi-jin, a CEO from a large company and the director of a private security firm are also involved. As a former president, \\"that man\\" lives under police protection in an affluent district of Seoul, but through a combination of ingenuity, skill, and well-placed money they are able to draw within shooting distance of their target.

In 2008, the film was originally set to be directed by Lee Hae-young based on his own adapted screenplay titled 29 Years, with Ryoo Seung-bum, Kim Ah-joong, Jin Goo, Chun Ho-jin, and Byun Hee- bong cast in the lead roles. But the production came to a halt once investors pulled out from funding the film ten days before filming began because of its controversial politically sensitive content, and rumors were rife that the pressure had originated from the conservative government. After nearly four years of languishing in pre-production limbo due to financial difficulties, online donations poured in from 15,000 individuals amounting to (US$646,000), with singer Lee Seung-hwan contributing another (US$923,000), toward the film's (US$4,246,000) production cost. Another investor was television personality Kim Je-dong. The crowdfunding enabled the production to finally begin filming Lee's script with a new cast and director on July 19, 2012. Filming wrapped on October 10, 2012. The film's ending credits roll for more than 10 minutes, as they include all 15,000 donors' names. Director Cho Geun- hyun said at the movie's press conference, \\"When one does something terribly wrong and hurts others, they should at least apologize. And even if he or she chooses not to, they should be punished for what they‚Äôve done. This is common sense, not some political idea.\\" Box office The film debuted at the top of the box office, selling 1,108,714 tickets in only a single week on release. It reached 2.5 million admissions in mid-December 2012, resulting in a total of nearly 3 million in January 2013.

The hangar measures approximately by and appurtenances cover . It was built with the capability of holding five B-36 Peacemaker, or six B-52 Stratofortress aircraft. The main hangar building was built in 1954 at a cost of $4.6 million. Description The interior of the hangar The hangar was constructed as one of the first hangars at Loring Air Force Base, which had opened two years prior to the opening of the hangar. The building was constructed with the goal of giving the Strategic Air Command crews a place to sustain an aircraft's condition should behavior by the Soviet Union warrant an attack. It also had the added benefit of protecting the crews from the harsh Maine weather. Having the capability to house five B-36 Peacemaker aircraft was critical, as the base was originally designated to host over one hundred of these aircraft. It was also one of the first double-cantilever hangars built for the Strategic Air Command, due to a new demand for a larger and more efficient space, in contrast to the World War II-era buildings which they inherited on many other bases. The building has an ejected caisson foundation designed to ensure stability in the harsh conditions of northern Maine. The foundation consists of 260 diameter concrete caissons that extend down to limestone bedrock at a depth of . Longitudinal arched steel trusses that are cantilevered at both ends from the shop supports in the center allow maximum vertical clearance. The north and south walls of the hangar each have a set of six doors that, when fully open, form a wide opening that accommodates the full wingspan of a B-36. Post-closure usage After the 1994 closure of Loring Air Force Base, many of the buildings were evaluated for historical significance in the Loring AFB Historic Building Inventory and Evaluation. The hangar was one of a handful of structures on the base that were listed for possible future inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, due to its historic nature. This view was concurred by the Maine State Historic Preservation Officer and the Air Force's recommendation of the Historic American Buildings Survey. The hangar is one of several Loring AFB buildings that have new uses as components of the Loring Commerce Centre.

The channel was used to make water available for overshot wheels (Kunstr√§der) and reversible wheels (Kehrr√§der) at the 4th Shaft (IV. Lichtloch) and the two Schwamkrug turbines at the 5th Shaft (V.

This went on until he turned 18 in 1907 when the artist moved to Munich, Germany enrolling at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste.Gardner (1990), II After seven years in Munich, Solotareff moved to Lausanne, Switzerland. In the six years he stayed there his style underwent a change from the German Impressionist style that inspired his Munich paintings to one more influenced by Fauvism.Gardner (1990), III In describing two of Solotareff's paintings from that period, \\"Meadow of Wild Flowers\\" and \\"Farm in Lausanne\\", James Gardner wrote \\"The paint has been thickly applied in elongated, energetic jabs that sway and pulsate in every direction like schools of fish. But only the surface seems agitated. Farther down there is the deep and reassuring calm that seems best to typify the Russian artist's sanguine disposition\\".Gardner (1990), IV The year 1920 found Solotareff traveling in France and Italy before settling in Paris where, under the influence of Pablo Picasso and Marie Laurencin, he began to paint in a more neo-classical style.Gardner (1990), IV-V While in Paris, Solotareff was a member of the Salon des Ind√©pendants. In 1937, the artist moved to New York, where he lived and painted for the rest of his life.Gardner (1990), VII He worked as a stage designer in the avant-garde Yiddish theater ARTEF ( ‚Äî Arbeter Teater Farband).

It was the B-side to his single \\"Release Me\\". The song is especially well known in New Zealand, where it has become a beloved folk song and is considered by some to be the \\"unofficial national anthem\\" of New Zealand.  Popularity in New Zealand  \\"Ten Guitars\\" was released as the B-side to Humperdinck's 1967 single \\"Release Me\\". While the A-side track was an international hit, in New Zealand radio programmers favoured \\"Ten Guitars\\" due to its upbeat sound and a guitar style that lent itself to the popular \\"Maori strum\\" technique. The song had originally been popularised in New Zealand by Rotorua radio programmer Eddie O'Strange of 1YZ. This led to increased sales of the single and national popularity of the song, particularly as a singalong party number. The song later became especially popular with Maori in the 1960s who had left their regional homes and moved to cities for work. The song was a reminder of life in their hometowns. = Cultural impact = Billy Connolly's 1975 album \\"The Big Yin: Billy Connolly In Concert\\" has a track \\"Glasgow Accents/Nine and a Half Guitars\\" where the Big Yin explains how he's sick of having to sing the song in folk clubs. A 1996 television documentary Ten Guitars looked at the history of the song and its impact on New Zealand culture. It featured cover versions of the song from prominent New Zealand musicians of the time, including Tim Finn and Neil Finn, the Topp Twins, Dalvanius Prime, Jan Hellriegel, Purest Form, Mika and Moana Maniapoto. In 1999, the New Zealand artist Michael Parekowhai created the sculptural work Ten Guitars. It was made up of ten custom-built guitars inlaid with paua shell designs of kowhaiwhai patterns. The work examines the role of Maori in New Zealand society, including the changing roles in the second half of the 20th century. In 2012, an attempt to break the world record for the most number of guitarists playing at once was made in Kaikohe, New Zealand, with \\"Ten Guitars\\" as the selected song.

History  The Morrell Park area (Lot 82) was originally developed by Mr John Morrell for use as a citrus and cashew nut plantation in the 1970s. The Aboriginal Lands Trust subsequently purchased Lot 82 and called for applications fromIndigenous people interested in establishing horticultural projects based upon single family enterprise and leases were issued. Over subsequent years it was found that the conditions were unsuitable for horticulture, and the area evolved into a rural residential area with blocks leased from the ALT to around 23 families.  Governance  Morrell Park is not a traditional community in that blocks are individually leased, and as such no community association exists to represent their interests. Individual lease holders negotiate directly with service providers.  Town planning  Morrell Park Layout Plan No.1 was prepared in accordance with State Planning Policy 3.2 Aboriginal Settlements, and was endorsed by the community on 1 December 2005 and the WAPC on 6 March 2007.

She sank after a collision with on 20 May 1922 in the English Channel. Two hundred fifty-two people were rescued from the 338 passengers and crew aboard at the time. A subsequent salvage operation recovered most of the cargo of gold and silver. Early career Caird & Company built Egypt at Greenock on the River Clyde, launching her in 1897. She generally ran between United Kingdom and India, but also was a hospital ship in the First World War. Final voyage Egypt left Tilbury, Essex, on 19 May 1922 carrying only 44 passengers but a cargo that included gold and silver bullion and gold sovereigns worth over ¬£1 million (around ¬£200 million at the 2012 gold price). The voyage proceeded normally until the early morning of 20 May when fog was encountered. As a safety measure Captain Collyer greatly reduced the speed of the ship. Egypt remained in fog until the afternoon when the navigator was able to sight landmarks on the French coast and fix the ship's position. After continuing the voyage for several hours a dense fog bank was suddenly encountered at around 7 o'clock. The engines were stopped but almost immediately afterwards a fog whistle was heard. The steamship Seine emerged through the fog and within seconds struck Egypts port side in the English Channel off the Armen Lighthouse, Finist√®re, France. Seine had a strengthened bow for ice-breaking, which penetrated deeply into Egypt‚Ä≤s hull before the ships drifted apart. An SOS distress signal was transmitted and replies were received from the steamers and RMS Andes but Egypt sank in less than 20 minutes before either ship arrived. Most of the passengers and crew were able to abandon ship in the lifeboats which were picked up by Seine, but 86 of the 352 people on board Egypt lost their lives. Salvage Because Egypt had such valuable cargo, it was not long before salvage attempts began. However, the Egypt‚Ä≤s wreck was not found until 1930. She was found lying upright in a depth of , making the recovery very difficult with the technology of the time. Giovanni Quaglia from the Genoese company Societ√† Ricuperi Marittimi (So.Ri.Ma.) was in charge of the operation and decided to use a diver in an armoured suit to direct the placing of explosives to blast through the ship to expose the strong room. The diver was then used to direct a grab which picked up the gold and silver. The salvage continued until 1935 by which time 98% of the contents of the strong room had been recovered.

The Monthly Review agreed that it was not a literary masterpiece, but praised it for its encyclopaedic treatment of the subject.The Monthly Review The Sporting Magazine in its sixth issue was equally complimentary about Felton's Treatise.Sporting Magazine Richard Trevithick's 1803 London Steam Carriage was the first steam-powered vehicle designed for transporting passengers around London, but was never a commercial success. The carriage was carried by ship from Falmouth to London and arrived at Felton‚Äôs carriage works in Leather Lane in April 1803. Felton constructed the body, designed to accommodate eight people. The driver steered the front wheel using a tiller, with the engineman on a low step behind the coach. In July 1803 it was driven for some ten miles to Paddington then back through Islington with 8 passengers, and as a precaution streets were closed to other vehicles. On one of the vehicle's test runs it tore down 7 yards of garden railing, causing London's first motor accident.The Telegraph In the 1980s a full-size replica of the London steam carriage was constructed. It was driven on the streets of Camborne on 28 April 2001, and in July 2003 retraced some of the original route between the Felton works in Leather Lane and St Cross Street.

The band initially gained a large following through vocalist Cody Carson's YouTube channel. Their following took on the name \\"143 family\\" later to be known as \\"Dreamcatchers\\". Set It Off was subsequently signed by Equal Vision Records after releasing a string of successful extended plays. In 2018 they signed to Fearless Records, and in February 2019 the band released Midnight, their fourth studio album, through the label. History = Formation (2008) = Cody Carson met Dan Clermont in high school, as both were in the marching band. Austin M. Kerr and Zach DeWall were in their own band together prior to the formation of Set It Off. The two bands brushed against each other while playing local shows, occasionally at the same time. After high school, Carson left for Ohio to attend the Oberlin Conservatory of Music as a classical clarinet student. In his first year, after exchanging a series of YouTube videos with All Time Low's frontman Alex Gaskarth, Carson asked if he could sing \\"Coffee Shop Soundtrack\\" on stage at the group's upcoming concert at the Cleveland House of Blues via a YouTube video, to which Gaskarth agreed. The performance helped Carson confirm his dream of starting a rock band, and not long afterwards, Carson dropped out of college and used his school money to come back and start up the band. DeWall and Kerr were amongst the first to join the band, and Dan Clermont also followed. James Arran was Set It Off's initial drummer, but financial struggles made gas purchases difficult for him, which resulted in Arran resigning on August 24, 2008. Blake Howell became Set It Off's next drummer but soon left the band due to difficulties his family was facing. Howell was replaced by Benjamin Panico (a.k.a. Benji Panic) on October 30, 2009; however, he and the band have since parted ways so that Panico could pursue his GED and later start his own photography studio. Howell was able to introduce the band to their current drummer, Maxx Danziger.

Carson stated, \\"Our main inspiration in writing this album was derived from personal experiences growing up. I loved being able to turn to songs that I could personally relate to. I want to provide that same kind of coping source for people. I want people to be able to turn on Horrible Kids and pick a song that pinpoints exactly what they're going through and allows them to vent through it.\\" After being released, the album debuted in the top 100 Alternative Albums on iTunes.

The band also added their own bonus to the donation, creating a total of $5,000 directly from the band; Equal Vision Records agreed to match the band's donation amount if the band reached No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. Cody Carson highly praised the organization's goals, stating, \\"We're honored to be working with VH1 Save The Music. If it wasn't for the music education program in my high school, Set It Off would not exist. I would not have met our guitarist, Dan Clermont, I wouldn't have been directed toward Oberlin Music Conservatory, and I wouldn't end up with even half of the musical knowledge I possess now. More people need to be able to experience the unity, leadership skills, and work ethic taught by being involved in music education programs in schools. Set It Off strongly endorses this organization for these, among many other, reasons. We're so excited to raise money for them and help spread the word about the importance of music education.\\" The album, which was produced, mixed and recorded by Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount at ZK Productions, debuted at the No. 174 position on the Billboard 200, No. 4 on the Top Heatseekers, and No. 38 on the Independent Albums chart.

Musical style and influences  During Set It Off‚Äôs early years the band fit into the pop-punk genre exclusively. Their debut album Cinematics (2012) featured orchestral elements, whereas its follow-up Duality (2014) was influenced by 1990s/2000s pop music. The band continued to progress in this direction with third studio album Upside Down (2016) which featured some of the band‚Äôs poppiest output yet. The majority of the orchestral string sounds are programmed and sequenced synthesizers added during production rather than traditionally recorded acoustic instruments. In 2015, Kerrang! magazine summarized the band's genre as pop rock. Back in January of 2019, Cody Carson posted an Ask Me Anything on Reddit where he answered fans questions regarding their band. One person asked what inspired their band name to which he responded \\"Fall Out Boy song, IIRC. Calm Before The Storm\\", referring to one of the lyrics in said song.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1998 to May 1999 she ran nine times and won four races. After winning twice from six starts as a two- year-old, she won the Fred Darling Stakes at Newbury. On her next appearance Wince won the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse. On her only subsequent appearance she finished unplaced in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh three weeks later. At the end of her three-year-old season she was retired from racing to become a successful broodmare. Background Wince, a large, powerful bay mare with a white blaze and a white sock, on her left foreleg was bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdulla's Juddmonte Farms. Wince was sired by Selkirk an American-bred miler who won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. As a breeding stallion, Selkirk's progeny include fifteen Group One winners including Cityscape (Dubai Duty Free), Leadership (Gran Premio di Milano) and Kastoria (Irish St. Leger). Her dam, Flit, won one minor race and was a full sister to the American racemare Skimble (Dahlia Handicap). Wince was trained by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden in all of her races by Kieren Fallon. Racing career =1998: two-year-old season= Wince began her career by finishing third in a five furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 1 June. A month later she was moved up to seven furlongs and recorded her first win in a maiden at Kempton Park. Wince was then moved up to Listed class and finished second to the favourite Fairy Queen in the Star Stakes at Sandown Park. The filly's second win came at Chester in August when she started at odds of 4/9 and won the six furlong Combermere Stakes by four lengths. Wince then returned to Listed class for the Oh So Sharp Stakes at Newmarket in October. She started 5/2 favourite but after Fallon struggled to obtain a clear run in the closing stages she finished fifth of the ten runners behind the 33/1 outsider Snittenby. Despite her defeat, Wince was made 9/4 favourite for the Group Two Rockfel Stakes two weeks later. After being in touch for the leaders for most of the way, she made no impression in the closing stages and finished seventh behind Hula Angel. Her performances had been promising, but did not suggest that she was a likely classic winner. Timeform expressed the opinion that Wince was unlikely to stay beyond seven furlongs. =1999: three-year-old season= Wince thrived over the winter of 1998/9 but only became a contender for the 1000 Guineas after her stable's leading filly, Bionic, was ruled out of the race by injury. On her three-year-old debut, Wince was sent to Newbury to contest the seven furlong Fred Darling Stakes, a trial race for the Guineas. Fallon restrained the filly in the early stages before sending her into the lead a furlong from the finish to win by one and a half lengths from the Mill Reef Stakes winner, Golden Silca. Sixteen days after her Newbury win, Wince started 4/1 favourite in a field of twenty-two fillies for the 1000 Guineas. The filly had been the subject of heavy betting support after a trial gallop in which she had finished a close second to the stable's leading colt Enrique, who then finished runner-up in the 2000 Guineas. As the Rowley Mile course was being redeveloped, the race was run on the Newmarket July course for the first time since 1945. The runners split into two groups, with Fallon positioning Wince towards the rear of the group nearest the stands. In the last quarter mile, Wince moved forward under a strong drive from Fallon and took the lead of the stands-side group a furlong from the finish. Despite drifting left towards the centre of the course, she prevailed by half a length from Wannabe Grand, with Valentine Waltz, who had raced on the opposite side of the course, a short head away in third. The win gave Henry Cecil his sixth win in the race equaling the 20th century record set by his father-in-law Noel Murless. On her next appearance, Wince started 5/4 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh. Fallon attempted to challenge the leaders in the final quarter mile, but Wince made no progress and finished fifth behind Hula Angel, who beat Golden Silca by a neck. After the race, Wince was examined by racecourse vets who found no serious injury, but Cecil reported that the filly \\"wasn't quite sound\\". Before she could run again, Wince later sustained a joint injury to one her hind legs which ended her racing career. Assessment Timeform rated Wince at 94+ as a two-year-old and 117 at three. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Wince an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Stud record Wince became a broodmare for her owners Juddmonte Stud. She has produced several winners, the best of which was Quiff, a filly sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Yorkshire Oaks and finished second in the St Leger in 2004. Wince died in 2016. *2001 Quiff (GB) : Bay filly, foaled 2 March, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì won G1 Yorkshire Oaks, York ‚Äì 2nd G1 St Leger Stakes, Doncaster *2004 Arabian Gulf (GB) : Bay colt, foaled 8 February, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì winner and placed 2nd G3 Chester Vase ‚Äì at stud in India *2006 Dream Win : Bay colt, foaled 21 January, by Oasis Dream (GB) ‚Äì winner of 4 minor races in England 2010‚Äì2012 *2010 Dream Wild : Bay filly, foaled 6 May, by Oasis Dream (GB) ‚Äì minor winner in England during 2013 Pedigree References Category:1996 racehorse births Category:2016 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 4-r Category:1000 Guineas winners ","title":"Wince"},{"id":"36663463","text":"Van Niekerk is an Afrikaans surname.

It is found in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic Ocean. Description The golden zoanthid is a colonial coral that grows in small irregular groups and linear rows that wind over the surface of its host sponge. It does not have a calcareous skeleton but the polyps are connected by a membranous basal connection. The polyps look like small sea anemones and are orange or bright yellow and about in diameter. They have a slender column and up to twenty six long, thin, pale yellow tentacles. As much as half the surface of the sponge may be covered by the coral, which may consist of up to 200 polyps. Distribution and habitat The golden zoanthid is common in the Caribbean Sea and round the Bahamas. It is also known from Jamaica, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is mostly found at depths between but occasionally occurs in shallower water. It is always found colonising a sponge, often the brown tube sponge (Agelas conifera), the green finger sponge (Iotrochota birotulata) or the pink or brown Topsentia ophiraphidites. It usually occurs in sandy or silty locations. Biology The golden zoanthid often contrasts vividly in colour with its host sponge, which would be expected to advertise its presence to potential sponge predators. It contains toxic substances that may deter fish such as the rock beauty (Holacanthus tricolo) from eating the host sponge. The golden zoanthid may also benefit from living on a sponge in that the sponge is a filter feeder and actively draws in a current of water through its pores. It can only cope with the most minute particles and the polyps may be able to capture the bigger food items wafted along in the current. The size of a golden zoanthid colony is increased by budding. New polyps generally grow at the ends of the rows.

It is listed as a \\"Registered Financial Institution\\" by the Bank of Tanzania, the central bank and national banking regulator. Overview The bank is a small financial institution in Tanzania. , the bank's shareholders' equity was valued at TSh8.5 billion (approx. US$4 million). History The idea to start a Women's Bank in Tanzania began in 1999, when a number of female entrepreneurs approached the then President of Tanzania, Benjamin William Mkapa, with the idea. Eight years later, in 2007, the Tanzania Women's Bank Limited (TWBL) was created. The bank officially opened for business on 28 July 2009. TWB's aim is to empower women economically and socially. It serves all segments of society including low income earners, large corporations and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Ownership From the time of its creation, in 2007, as a private limited liability company, 97% of the shareholding in the stock of the bank was owned by the Government of Tanzania. The remaining 3% was owned by private institutions and individuals. In August 2012, the Tanzanian government began the process of listing the shares of the bank's stock on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), through the issuance of an initial public offering (IPO).

History The Baptist denomination in Sri Lanka began in 1812, with the arrival of Rev. James CharterJohnson 2010, p. 205. a missionary from the Baptist Missionary Society of the United Kingdom, a colleague of the legendary pioneer of the Modern Missionary movement Rev. William Carey.Brackney 2009, p. 540. During early days church planting & evangelism of Ceylonese was done by the missionaries of Baptist Missionary Society with its headquarters in Britain. The first Baptist church was established in Grandpass Colombo and expanded to other areas of the Western, North Western, and Central regions of the island. The missionaries began establishing schools in the regions where they had already planted churches. These schools were also used for worship and other evangelical programs. In 1887 Sri Lanka Baptist Mission was founded and worked alongside the Baptist Missionary Society of Great Britain. In 1894 the Ceylon Baptist Union was formed. In 1924 the Baptist Missionary Society took a decision to gradually withdraw financial support and personnel from Sri Lanka. This marked the movement by which local leadership began to assert itself and the Baptist community became self-supporting and took on a more truly Sri Lankan image. This gave birth to the Ceylon Baptist Union representing the local Baptist congregations. In 1944 the Lanka Baptist Mission and Ceylon Baptist Union were amalgamated to form the Ceylon Baptist Council. In 1957, soon after the social transition that was set in motion and a swing towards emphasis on the national languages the name was changed to Sri Lanka Baptist Sangamaya^ Gunawardena 2006, p.44.Ceylon Baptist Council (Incorporation)Baptist Missionary Society a literal translation of Ceylon Baptist Council to Sinhala in keeping with national trends in the country by an act of parliament.

She spent much of her life in England. A period in South Africa provided the material for some of her books. Early years She was born in New York and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio with her mother, following her father's death. Her mother remarried Thomas Malloy. Career She was at one time principal singer in the choir of Cincinnati Cathedral and later a contralto soloist at Henry Ward Beecher's church in Brooklyn. In 1877, she married √âmile-Leon, the Count de Br√©mont, a French medical doctor working in New York. Following his death in May 1882, she moved to Europe. she met theatrical promoter Brandon Thomas in London. He set up a literary and musical tour for her, in the course of which she visited India, Australia and South Africa. In London in 1888, she was initiated into the Order of the Golden Dawn, alongside Oscar Wilde's wife Constance. She later wrote a memoir about Wilde and his mother. In May 1888, she appeared at the Globe Theatre in London in \\"the Countess de Br√©mont's Matinee\\" as Rosalind in the forest scenes from As You Like It. The Era said \\"her style was decidedly unsatisfactory\\". In 1893, in the course of a review of three volumes by de Br√©mont, published under the general title of The World of Music, the New York Times reported that \\"it is said that this quondam light of Cincinnati now coruscates amid the incandescents of the Mrs Leo Hunter circle of London.\\" She spent some time in South Africa. On her departure from the country in June 1890, it was reported that she had a novel based on her experiences there in progress, and had begun preparing a lecture on life in the Transvaal, focusing on the social effects of the discovery of gold. The Gentleman Digger was published the next year, its characters thinly disguised versions of real people. In 1894, while working for St Paul's magazine in London, she wrote to the librettist W.S. Gilbert requesting an interview. He replied, saying that he would cooperate in return for a fee of 20 guineas. She wrote back saying that she anticipated \\"the pleasure of writing Mr Gilbert's obituary for nothing\\". Gilbert retaliated by sending letters to the press which referred to \\"a lady styling herself the Countess de Br√©mont\\". She sued Gilbert for libel, claiming he had implied that she had no right to her title. Gilbert told the court that he had no knowledge of de Br√©mont except for the letter, and the jury found in his favour. She was in London during the First World War, where her experiences of German air-raids inspired her novel The Black Opal. In 1920, it was reported her fortune was gone. She died \\"penniless\\" in Earl's Court in 1922, aged 73, and was buried in the Roman Catholic section of Kensal Green Cemetery.

Byutukayev was listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the United States on July 13, 2016. Biography Until 2010, Emir Khamzat was a little-known field commander. In the summer of that year, there was a dispute between Dokka Umarov and several commanders of the Chechen wing of the Caucasus Emirate. They were Tarkhan Gaziyev, Muhannad, Aslambek Vadalov and Khuseyn Gakayev. That led to Byutukayev's rapid promotion to the commander of Chechnya's Southwestern Front. He also succeeded the slain Said Buryatsky as leader of the Caucasus Emirate's unit of suicide bombers, the Riyad-us Saliheen. In January 2011, Byutukayev trained Magomed Yevloyev, the suicide bomber, who carried out the bombing of Domodedovo International Airport in Moscow. Shortly before the bombing, Dokka Umarov, Byutukayev and Magomed Yevloyev filmed a video, claiming responsibility for the attacks. In March 2011, it was reported, that Aslan Byutukayev had been killed in an airstrike by Russian Air Force in Ingushetia, along with the deputy leader of the Caucasus Emirate, Supyan Abdullayev. However, while the rebels confirmed the death of Abdullayev, the death of Byutukayev was denied. In June 2011, in a video released on the internet, a silent Byutukayev appeared at the side of Dokka Umarov, as the latter claimed responsibility for the assassination of Yuri Budanov, a former Russian Colonel, who kidnapped, murdered and allegedly raped an 18-year-old Chechen girl during Second Chechen War. In July 2011, at a meeting of the Caucasus Emirate's Sharia Court, Umarov appointed Byutukayev to his deputy in the newly created Western Sector of Vilayat Nokhchicho. In May 2014, Byutukayev appeared in a video with a large number of field commanders of the Vilayat Nokhchicho, giving an oath of allegiance to the new head of the Caucasus Emirate, Aliaskhab Kebekov, who succeeded Dokka Umarov. Toward the end of 2014, the Caucasus Emirate became more active in their insurgent activities. On 5 October 2014, a suicide bombing took place near the city hall of Grozny. Five Russian police officers and the suicide bomber were killed. Another 12 people were wounded. Byutukayev also took responsibility for the 2014 Grozny clashes, during which 14 Russian policemen were killed and a total of 35 people wounded. In June 2015, and following the death of Caucasus Emirate leader, Aliaskhab Kebekov, Byutukayev released an audio message, pledging allegiance to ISIL and its leader, Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi.–ê—Å–ª–∞–Ω –ë—é—Ç—É–∫–∞–µ–≤ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—è–≥–Ω—É–ª –ª–∏–¥–µ—Ä—É –ò–ì –æ—Ç –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –±–æ–µ–≤–∏–∫–æ–≤ –ß–µ—á–Ω–∏ In 2016, according to reports he was hiding in Turkey although his real whereabouts are unknown as of since.

Fred Melville, speaking philatelically, called it \\"one of the seven wonders of the world\\".\\"The Spell of the 'Suns'\\" by Nils Farnstrom in The London Philatelist, Vol. LXVIII, No. 798, May 1959, pp. 94-95. It is the largest known multiple of this issue of which only a few blocks are known to exist. Most of the plating information about this issue has been derived from this one block. The 'Diligencia' stamps The postal services in Uruguay organised by the stagecoach companies, issued on October 1, 1856 the so-called 'Diligencia' (stagecoach stamp). This issue was intended for correspondence carried by stagecoach. There were three values: * 60 cent√©simos blue, for single page letters * 80 cent√©simos green, for two-page letters * 1 real red, for three-page letters. The stamps were issued in sheets of 35, printed on white woven unwatermarked paper at the M√®ge Lithograph Workshop of M√®ge y Willems Printing Ltd in Montevideo. Largest known multiple The 80 cent√©simos green corner block of 15 is a multiple from the top right of an unused sheet of 35. It includes positions 3-5, 8-10, 13-15, 18-20, 24-25 and 30. Plating of the 'Diligencias' was made possible by the slightly shifted alignment of transfers and the common characteristics of this sheet. This multiple originates from a complete sheet originally owned by Dr. Wonner. The ‚ÄòSoto Hermanos‚Äô philatelic dealers broke it up into several blocks in the 19th Century. Subsequently it was part of the collection of Vicente Ferrer (who named it), Wonner, Charles Lathrop Pack, E.J. Lee, Alfred Lichtenstein, Roberto Hoffmann, Norman Hubbard, Gene Scott and Tito Giamporcaro. Significance The block enabled Pack to establish new concepts on the plating of this issue, which were improved by E.J. Lee.Lee, E.J. The Postage Stamps of Uruguay. London: M. Harvey, 1931. (Awarded the Crawford Medal) Most plating of this issue has been derived from this block and it is considered the foundation upon which the technical philately of Uruguay is built.

He specialized in the 5,000-metre and the 10,000-metre runs, as well as in cross-country running. At the 1952 Olympic Games, he competed in the 5,000-meter run. Saksvik became the Norwegian champion twenty times, a national record. In addition, he captured three Norwegian records in long- distance running from Martin Stokken, and held onto them for some years each. In the late-1950s, Saksvik's dominance in Norwegian long-distance running was eclipsed by Tor Torgersen and fellow Ranheim club member Ernst \\"Kruska\\" Larsen, later Thor Helland. Athletic career Saksvik competed in several international championships. In his first, the Olympic 5000 metres in 1952, he did not progress from the heats. However, at the 1954 European Championships, he finished seventh in both 5000 and 10,000 metres. He later finished fourteenth in the 10,000 metres at the 1958 European Championships. Saksvik is also known for winning twenty Norwegian championship titles in athletics, a Norwegian record which is tied with thrower Knut Hjeltnes. On the track he became Norwegian champion in the 5000 metres in 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1957, alternating mostly with cityfellows Martin Stokken and Ernst \\"Kruska\\" Larsen. He also won silver medals in this distance in 1949, 1951 and 1955. He won the 10,000 metres in 1953, 1954, 1956 and 1957. By winning his first gold medal, Saksvik ended the six-year dominance of Martin Stokken. However, in 1958 Saksvik only won the silver, behind club fellow Ernst \\"Kruska\\" Larsen. Saksvik also set several Norwegian records. In the 3000 metres, he beat Martin Stokken's record in 1952 with the time 8:22.4, and broke his own record four times. His last record, 8:10.8 achieved at Bislett stadion in August 1955, stood for a year until overcome by Ernst \\"Kruska\\" Larsen. Saksvik is still the oldest record setter in the event. In the 5000 metres, he also broke Martin Stokken's record in 1952, improved it once, lost it to Stokken in 1954 and then regained it before the same thing happened with Ernst Larsen. Saksvik held his last record, 14:12.2 achieved at Bislett, from September 1955 and thirteen months until Larsen regained it. Lastly, he broke Stokken's 10,000 metre record in August 1952 in Copenhagen, a record which was only a week old. Saksvik improved it from 29:48.4 to 29:43.2 in September 1955 in Frankfurt an der Oder. It stood until 1959 when overcome by Tor Torgersen. Saksvik also dominated Norwegian cross-country running in the early 1950s. His first medal was a silver in the cross-country forest course, achieved when he represented IL i BUL in 1949. He proceeded to win the race in 1953, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959 and 1960. He won the 3 kilometre cross-country championship in 1952, 1953 and 1955 with silver medals in 1950, 1957 and 1958, and the 8 kilometre event in 1956 and 1957 with a silver medal in 1951.

It is loosely based on the drama with the same name by Victorien Sardou, reinterpreted in an ironic-grotesque style.  Plot  Rome, 14 June 1800. Napoleon's army threatens to conquer Italy, including the Papal States. Rome is reeking with corruption, especially among the clergy, determined to retain their privileges based on the exploitation of the poor ignorant people. The fugitive patriot Cesare Angelotti, escaped from Castel Sant'Angelo, is sheltered by painter Mario Cavaradossi. Baron Scarpia, regent of the Pontifical Police, hunts him down by duping Floria Tosca, Cavaradossi's mistress, into thinking that her lover is cheating on her. The woman, trailed by Scarpia, heads for Cavaradossi's house, hoping to catch him in the act, but finds him instead in Angelotti's company. Realizing she's been deceived, Tosca tries her best to save her lover, but it is too late. Scarpia reaches the house and surprises Angelotti, who commits suicide rather than being taken in. Scarpia then arrests the painter for high treason, a capital offense. Lusting after Tosca, the baron blackmails her: he will have the painter freed if she yields to his sexual advances. She accedes, whereupon he makes a show of ordering his minions to have the painter shot with blanks. The letter of safe conduct written, Scarpia is then stabbed in the back by Tosca, who then bolts off to Castel Sant'Angelo to be reunited with her lover. However, Cavaradossi is executed for real, and Tosca, in despair, throws herself off the ramparts of the castle and commits suicide. Life in Rome continues seemingly unchanged, with the clergy oblivious to the new times looming, and the changes about to overtake the world.

Early life Triratna Man (alternative name: Lhandur) was born at Nyata, Kathmandu, the eldest of the three sons of trader and philanthropist Dharma Man Tuladhar and mother Hera Lani Tuladhar. He was educated at home, and taught himself English and Chinese. He learned Tibetan and Hindi during his stay in Tibet and India. In 1913, he was married to Punya Maya Kansakar. Page 24. Triratna Man was also an activist in the movement to revive Theravada Buddhism in Nepal; and in 1924, became a member of the Buddhist Relief Association founded by Buddhist scholar and leader Dharmaditya Dharmacharya.Singh, Harischandra Lal (2007).

Business in Tibet Triratna Man belonged to a long line of Lhasa Newar merchants. His family owned a business house in Lhasa known as Chhusingsyar which has a history dating from 1790 AD. The firm conducted trade between Nepal, India and Tibet. Its main business was musk, brocade, gems, textiles and general merchandise. Page 23. Besides its main shop in Lhasa, the firm maintained shops in Gyantse and Phari in Tibet, and in Kalimpong, Kolkata and Ladakh in India.Hilker, D. S. Kansakar (2005).

New Delhi: Sharda Mandir. Page 258. He made two more trips to Lhasa, and lived there from 1935-1941 and from 1947-1953, spending a total of 13 years in Tibet. In 1947, Triratna Man became president of the Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa and held the post for a year. . Page 5. After he returned to Nepal leaving the business in the care of his sons, he was elected to the executive committee of the Kathmandu Chapter of the association in 1955. He sat on the committee until 1957. His eldest son Pratek Man Tuladhar wound up the business house of Chhusingsyar and returned to Nepal in 1960. The traditional Tibet trade came to an end following the Sino-Indian War of 1962 when the trade route through Sikkim was shut down. Triratna Man then settled down to a quiet life in Kathmandu.

Written by Winston Miller, based on a story by Betty Burbridge and Connie Lee, the film is about a singing cowboy who inherits a meat-packing plant and must face stiff competition from a beautiful business rival. Plot Singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) work on a ranch owned by Ann Randolph (June Storey). Gene is unaware that he has just inherited the Belmont Packing Company. While Gene and Frog take the cattle to market, Gene has an argument with Ann who fires them both, giving them one of the steers as back pay. Later the local sheriff, seeing a Randolph steer in the possession of the two cowboys, arrests Gene and Frog on suspicion of cattle rustling. Attorney Henry Walker (Forbes Murray), who has been searching for the singing cowboy, finally locates Gene at the jail and informs him of his inheritance. After being released from jail, Gene takes possession of the Belmont Packing Company. Ann, who owns a rival packing company, had plans to merge the two companies under her ownership. Now she is dismayed to learn that the man she just fired is now her main business competitor. Ann's conniving general manager and fianc√©, Donald Gregory (Warren Hull), convinces her to feign romantic interest in Gene and sweet talk him into selling his company to her. At first the plan appears to work, and Gene agrees to Ann's offer and signs a contract of sale. Later, when he learns that Gregory plans to close the plant putting all his employees out of work, Gene tears up the contract and decides to stay in the packing business. Gene soon learns that his biggest business challenge is having enough cattle to fill the distribution demands. He initiates a campaign to convince the ranchers to sell their stock to his Belmont Packing Company, and soon the contracts start coming in. Ann responds with her own campaign, however, appealing to ranchers with a \\"helpless woman\\" routine. When he notices her success, Gene changes tactics and starts a new campaign, singing to the ranchers and organizing parades in an effort to win their business, and the campaign succeeds. Unable to compete with legitimate business approaches, Gregory orders his men to use violence to stop the singing cowboy. Ann's little sister Patsy (Mary Lee), who has a crush on Gene, overhears Gregory's men plotting to dynamite the dam and flood the valley. After she warns Gene of Gregory's scheme, Gene rides off and intercepts Gregory's henchmen before they can plant their explosives. Soon after, Gregory is indicted for sabotage, and Gene and Ann form a business alliance as well as a romantic relationship.

As per Tamil Nadu Hindu Endowments Board, there are 38615 Temples. Most of the largest Hindu Temples reside here. Studded with complex architecture, variety of sculptures, and rich inscriptions, the temples remain the very essence of the culture and heritage of Tamil land, with historical records dating back to at least 3,000 years. The state also abounds with a large number of temple tanks. The state has 2,359 temple tanks located in 1,586 temples. and also confluence of many architectural styles. From ancient temples to the Indo-Saracenic style (pioneered in Madras) of the colonial era, churches, mosques to 20th-century steel and chrome of skyscrapers.  History  Throughout Tamilakam, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance. The king was 'the representative of God on earth‚Äô and lived in a \\"koyil\\", which means the \\"residence of God\\". The Modern Tamil word for temple is koil. Titular worship was also given to kings. Other words for king like \\"k≈ç\\" (\\"king\\"), \\"i·πüai\\" (\\"emperor\\") and \\"ƒÅ·πá·∏çavar\\" (\\"conqueror\\") now primarily refer to God. Tolkappiyar refers to the Three Crowned Kings as the \\"Three Glorified by Heaven\\". In the Dravidian-speaking South, the concept of divine kingship led to the assumption of major roles by state and temple.  Sangam period architecture  From 580BCE - 300CE, the greatest accomplishments of the kingdoms of the early Chola, Chera and the Pandyan kingdoms included brick shrines to deities murugan, Shiva, Amman and Vishnu. Several of these have been unearthed near Adichanallur, Kaveripoompuharpattinam and Mahabalipuram, and the construction plans of these sites of worship were shared to some detail in various poems of Sangam literature. One such temple, the Saluvannkuppan Murukan temple, unearthed in 2005, consists of three layers. The lowest layer, consisting of a brick shrine, is one of the oldest of its kind in South India, and is the oldest shrine found dedicated to Murukan. It is one of only two brick shrine pre Pallava Hindu temples to be found in the state, the other being the Veetrirundha Perumal Temple at Veppathur dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The dynasties of early medieval Tamilakkam expanded and erected structural additions to many of these brick shrines. Sculptures of erotic art, nature and deities from the Meenakshi Temple, and Ranganathaswamy Temple date from the Sangam period. Many of the temples of this time have been built on either bricks or granite stones but they didn't survived till modern times due to the destruction caused by the invasion of the Dehli Sultanate Empire under the leadership of Malik Kafur. Several brick structures dating to the Sangam era have been unearthed at places across Tamil Nadu such as keeladi, adichanallur and kodumanal. The findings at these sites indicate that the buildings were built using burnt bricks.  Pallava architecture  Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Pallava architecture The Pallavas ruled from AD (600‚Äì900) and their greatest constructed accomplishments are the single rock temples in Mahabalipuram and their capital Kanchipuram, now located in Tamil Nadu. thumb Pallava art and architecture represent an early stage of Dravidian art and architecture which blossomed to its fullest extent under the Chola Dynasty. The first stone and mortar temples of South India were constructed during Pallava rule and were based on earlier brick and timber prototypes. The earliest examples of Pallava constructions are rock-cut temples dating from 610 ‚Äì 690 CE and structural temples between 690 ‚Äì 900 CE. A number of rock-cut cave temples bear the inscription of the Pallava king, Mahendravarman I and his successors.Nilakanta Sastri, pp412‚Äì413 The greatest accomplishments of the Pallava architecture are the rock-cut Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram at Mahabalipuram, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, including the Shore Temple.Mamallapuram, Encyclopedia Britannica This group includes both excavated pillared halls, with no external roof except the natural rock, and monolithic shrines where the natural rock is entirely cut away and carved to give an external roof. Pallava sculptors later graduated to free-standing structural shrines which inspired Chola temples of a later age. Some of the best examples of Pallava art and architecture are the Kailasanathar Temple at Kanchipuram, the Shore Temple and the Pancha Rathas of Mahabalipuram. Akshara was the greatest sculptor of their time.Nilakanta Sastri, p139Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Dist. Kanchipuram , Archaeological Survey of India (2014)  Pandyan architecture  An aerial view of the Meenakshi Amman Temple After the close of the Sangam age, the first Pandyan empire was established by Kadungon in the 6th century by defeating the Kalabhras, The empire ruled AD (6th ‚Äì 10th century). Rock cut and structural temples are significant part of pandyan architecture. The Vimana and mandapa are some of the features of the early Pandyan temples. Groups of small temples are seen at Tiruchirappalli district of Tamil Nadu. The Shiva temples have a Nandi bull sculpture in front of the maha mandapa. In the later stages of Pandyas rule, finely sculptured idols, gopurams on the vimanas were developed. Gopurams are the rectangular entrance and portals of the temples. Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai and Nellaiappar Temple in Tirunelveli were built during the reign of the Pandyas. Nellaiappar Temple, Pandyan architecture, 7th century CE = Nellaiappar Temple = Nellaiappar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva, located in Tirunelveli, built by Pandyas and the sanctums of the temple were constructed by Nindraseer Nedumaran who reigned in the 7th century. The mani mandapam with its famous musical pillar was built by Later Pandyas in the 7th century. Nellaiappar temple is spread over 14 acres. The gopuram of this temple is 850 feet long and 756 feet wide. Sangili Mandapam built on 1647 by vadamalaiyappa pillayan connects the Ganthimathi Amman and Nellaiyappar temples.Thirukkoilkal vazhikaatti, Tirunelveli District; tnhrce; August 2014;page 11 From the inscriptions of Kulasekkara Pandiyan we learn that he defeated the Chera, Chola and Hoysala kings and built the outer walls of the temple with the war booty. = Kalugumalai temples of Pandyas = The temples in Kalugumalai, a rocky hill in Thoothukudi district in southern Tamil Nadu. Kalugumalai houses the 8th century Jain Beds, Vettuvan Koil and Kalugasalamoorthy Temple, a Murugan temple at the foothills. The rock-cut temples, sculptures and the carvings are exemplary of early Pandyan architecture. The Jain beds are dedicated to the Jain and Hindu religious figures. Constructed in rock cut style, the unfinished temple was built during the reign of Pandyan king Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (768-800 CE). There are approximately 150 niches in the bed, that includes images of Gomateshwara, Parshvanatha and other Tirthankaras of the Jainism. Kalugumalai Jain Beds, Pandyan architecture, 768-800 CE The carvings in the Vettuvan Koil show the top portion of the temple, with an unfinished bottom. The sculptures and the carvings are indicative of Pandyan art during the period. The granite rock looks like a blooming lotus, with hills surrounding it on three sides. The vimana (ceiling over the sanctum) has niches of Parsavadevatas, the attendant deities of Shiva, like ganas, Dakshinamurthy depicted playing a mridanga, Siva with his consort Uma, dancers, various niches of Nandi (the sacred bull of Shiva) and animals like monkeys and lions. Historian Sivaramamurti believes that this is the only place where Vettuvan Koil in Kalugumalai, Pandyan architecture, 8th century CE Dakshinamurthy is depicted playing the Mridanga (a percussion instrument), while in all other places, he is depicted playing Veena. Epigrapher like V. Vedachalam believes that there is a spontaneity in the sculptures indicating of natural human movements like in Sculpture on the ceiling of the Kalugasalamoorthy temple, Pandyan architecture, 8th century CE the Shiva and Uma sculpture where they seem to be talking like common folks. The sanctum of the Kalugasalamoorthy temple is approached through a pillared hall near the gateway. The temple tank is located outside the temple. The sanctum is built in a rock-cut cave, which houses the image of Murugan in the form of Kazhugachalamurthi in seated posture. The sanctum faces West and the image of the presiding deity is tall. The image is sported with six hands with one of them holding Vel (divine spear), his left leg over the shoulder of the peacock and right is left hanging. There are separate shrines of his consorts Valli facing South and Deivanai facing North. There is a separate shrine for Shiva and Parvathi and all the Parsvatah Devatas (attendant deities) associated with Shiva temples. Usually in Murugan temples, his vehicle peacock would be heading towards his right, but it is sported on to the left of Murugan in this temple. It is believed that Indra, the king of celestial deities, appeared as peacock to worship Murugan. The image of the peacock is hence covered during the festivals.  Chola architecture  Detail of the main vimanam (tower) of the 349x349pxThe Chola kings ruled from AD (848‚Äì1280) and included Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola who built temples such as the Brihadeshvara Temple of Thanjavur and Brihadeshvara Temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, the Airavatesvara Temple of Darasuram and the Sarabeswara (Shiva) Temple, also called the Kampahareswarar Temple at Thirubhuvanam, the last two temples being located near Kumbakonam. The first three among the above four temples are titled Great Living Chola Temples among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Cholas were prolific temple builders right from the times of the first king Vijayalaya Chola after whom the eclectic chain of Vijayalaya Chozhisvaram temple near Narttamalai exists. These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. alt= Temple building received great impetus from the conquests and the genius of Aditya I Parantaka I, Sundara Chola, Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola I. Rajendra Chola 1 built the Rajaraja Temple at Thanjur after his own name. The maturity and grandeur to which the Chola architecture had evolved found expression in the two temples of Tanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram. He also proclaimed himself as Gangaikonda. In a small portion of the Kaveri belt between Tiruchy-Tanjore-Kumbakonam, at the height of their power, the Cholas have left over 2300 temples, with the Tiruchy-Thanjavur belt itself boasting of more than 1500 temples. The magnificent Siva temple of Thanjavur built by Raja Raja I in 1009 as well as the Brihadisvara Temple of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, completed around 1030, are both fitting memorials to the material and military achievements of the time of the two Chola emperors. The largest and tallest of all Indian temples of its time, the Tanjore Brihadisvara is at the apex of South Indian architecture.See Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955). A History of South India, pp 421 In fact, two succeeding Chola kings Raja Raja II and Kulothunga III built the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram and the Kampahareswarar Siva Temple at Tribhuvanam respectively, both temples being on the outskirts of Kumbakonam around AD 1160 and AD 1200. All the four temples were built over a period of nearly 200 years reflecting the glory, prosperity and stability under the Chola emperors. Contrary to popular impression, the Chola emperors patronized and promoted construction of a large number of temples that were spread over most parts of the Chola empire. These include 40 of the 108 Vaishnava Divya Desams out of which 77 are found spread most of South India and others in Andhra and North India. In fact, the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, which is the biggest temple in India () and the Chidambaram Natarajar Temple (though originally built by the Pallavas but possibly seized from the Cholas of the pre-Christian era when they ruled from Kanchi) were two of the most important temples patronized and expanded by the Cholas and from the times of the second Chola King Aditya I, these two temples have been hailed in inscriptions as the tutelary deities of the Chola Kings. alt= Temple shrine on the Koneswaram temple promontory extremity and the Ketheeswaram temple and Munneswaram temple compounds contained tall gopuram towers by Chola rule of Trincomalee, Mannar, Puttalam and Chidambaram's expansion that escalated the building of those syncretic latter styles of Dravidian architecture seen across the continent pictured.K.A.

The domain of constant excess : plural worship at the Munnesvaram temples in Sri Lanka. pp. 114 Of course, the two Brihadisvara Temples at Thanjavur and Gangaikonda Cholapuram as well as the other two Siva temples, namely the Airavatesvara Temple of Darasuram and the Sarabeswara (Shiva) Temple which is also popular as the Kampahareswarar Temple at Thirubhuvanam, both on the outskirts of Kumbakonam were the royal temples of the Cholas to commemorate their innumerable conquests and subjugation of their rivals from other parts of South India, Deccan Ilangai or Sri Lanka and the Narmada-Mahanadi-Gangetic belts. But the Chola emperors underlined their non-partisan approach to religious Back view of Raja gopuram, Brihadisvara Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Chola architecture iconography and faith by treating the presiding deities of their other two peerless creations, namely the Ranganathaswamy Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu at Srirangam and the Nataraja Temple at Chidambaram which actually is home to the twin deities of Siva and Vishnu (as the reclining Govindarajar) to be their 'Kuladheivams' or tutelary (or family) deities. The Cholas also preferred to call only these two temples which home their tutelary or family deities as Koil or the 'Temple', which denotes the most important places of worship for them, underlining their eq. The above-named temples are being proposed to be included among the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which will elevate them to the exacting and exalting standards of the Great Living Chola Temples. The temple of Gangaikondacholapuram, the creation of Rajendra Chola I, was intended to exceed its predecessor in every way. Completed around 1030, only two decades after the temple at Thanjavur and in much the same style, the greater elaboration in its appearance attests the more affluent state of the Chola Empire under Rajendra.Nagasamy R, Gangaikondacholapuram (1970) This temple has a larger Siva linga than the one at Thanjavur but the Vimana of this temple is smaller in height than the Thanjavur vimana. The Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes all over the world. Among the existing specimens in museums around the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, such as Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, and the Siva saints. Though conforming generally to the iconographic conventions established by long tradition, the sculptors worked with great freedom in the 11th and the 12th centuries to achieve a classic grace and grandeur. The best example of this can be seen in the form of Nataraja the Divine Dancer.The bronze image of nataraja at the Nagesvara Temple in Kumbakonam is the largest image known.  Vijayanagara and Nayak architecture  = Vellore Fort = Vellore Fort was built by Chinna Bommi Reddy and Thimma Reddy Nayak, subordinate chieftains under Sadasiva Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire in the year of 1566 AD. It is mentioned that \\"there is no such fort on the face of earth like the one in Vellore. It had a deep wet ditch (moat) where once 10,000 crocodiles swarmed, waiting to grab every intruder into this impregnable fort. It has huge double walls with bastions projecting irregularly, where two carts can be driven abreast\\". The fort was constructed in granite from the nearby quarries in Arcot and Chittor districts. It spreads over an area of and is located at an altitude of within a broken mountain range. The fort is surrounded by a moat which was once used as an additional line of defence in the case of an invasion. It was supposed to have included an escape tunnel leading to Virinjipuram about away, which could be used by the king and other royals in the event of an attack. This report was however later disputed by researchers of the ASI who found no evidence of the existence of such a passage. The fort is considered to be among the best of military architecture in Southern India and is known for its grand ramparts, wide moat and robust masonry. The Jalakanteshwara Temple inside Vellore fort is a fine example of Vijayanagaram Architecture. The temple has exquisite carvings on its gopuram (tower), richly carved stone pillars, large wooden gates and stunning monoliths and sculptures. These Vijayanagara sculptures are similar to the ones present in Soundararajaperumal Temple, Thadikombu, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Srivilliputhur Divya Desam and Alagar Koyil. The Gopuram of the tower is over 100 ft. in height. The temple also has a Mandapam, with the hall supported by carved stone pillars of dragons, horses and yalis (lion like creature). Vellore Fort and Jalakandeswarar temple Panorama Meenakshi Amman Temple complex, Pandyan architecture and Madurai Nayak architecture The Madurai and Tanjavur Nayaks made great contributions to architectural style, the main characteristics of the style during this period being the elaborate mandapas of the \\"hundred- pillared\\" and \\"thousand-pillared\\" types, the high gopurams with stucco statues on the surface and the long corridors. The main temples representing this style are: * The Ranganatha temple at Srirangam ‚Äì noted for its increase in the number of enclosures; * The temple at Rameswaram ‚Äì noted for its long corridors; * The Subramanya temple at the Brihadisvara Temple court at Tanjavur ‚Äì noted for its fine vimana with ratha and maha mandapas; * Meenakshi Temple at Madurai ‚Äì noted for the great splendour its \\"thousand-pillared\\" mandapam, and the Thanga Thamarai kulam (\\"Golden Lotus water pool\\"). Interior of Durbar Hall, Thanjavur Maratha palace = Thanjavur Maratha kingdom = The Thanjavur Maratha palace was originally constructed by the rulers of Thanjavur Nayak kingdom. After the fall of the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom, it served as the official residence of the Thanjavur Maratha. The palace complex consists of the Sadar Mahal Palace, the queen's courtyard and the Durbar Hall. The Royal Palace Museum contains a splendid collection of Chola bronzes. The Raja Serfoji Memorial Hall and the Royal Palace Museum are situated in the Sadar Mahal Palace. There is also a small bell tower. The Saraswathi Mahal Library is situated with the Thanjavur palace complex.  Colonial  San Thome Basilica is a Roman Catholic (Latin Rite) minor basilica in Santhome, in the city of Chennai (Madras), India. It was built in the 16th century by Portuguese explorers, and rebuilt again with the status of a cathedral by the British in 1893. The Madras High Court and Government Museum in Chennai were designed by Henry Irwin. = Indo-Saracenic architecture = Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G.Ramachandran Central Railway Stationleft Indo-Saracenic architecture is a type of architecture used by the British architects in India in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. It is a combination of Islamic, Hindu, and Byzantine architecture. Features of Indo-Saracenic architecture include domes, arches, minarets, and stained glass. The British built many public buildings like museums, educational institutions, and railway stations using this type of architecture. Examples of Indo-Saracenic style buildings in Chennai include Madras High Court, Senate House, Chepauk Palace, and Egmore Railway station. = Notable buildings in Chennai = Many historic buildings are still fully functional and host government, business or educational establishments. Chennai is home to the second largest collection of heritage buildings in the country, after Kolkata. Chepauk Palace, Chennai  Fort St. George  Senate House, Chennai Built in 1639, Fort St George, used to house the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly and Secretariat. Tipu Sultan's cannons decorate the ramparts of the Fort's museum. The Fort has the country's tallest flagstaff at a height of 150 feet. The fort is one of the 163 notified areas (megalithic sites) in the state of Tamil Nadu.  Chepauk Palace  Constructed in 1768, it was the first building in India constructed using the Indo-Saracenic type of architecture. It was designed by Paul Benfield, a British architect. The Chepauk Palace used to be the official residence of the Nawabs of Arcot. It has a total area of 117 acres with two blocks - Kalas Mahal and Humayun Mahal.  Senate House  Constructed in 1879 by Robert Chisholm, the Senate House is located inside the University of Madras campus and represents the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture. The main door of the Senate House opens to the Great Hall which is 150 feet long, 60 feet wide, and 50 feet high. The first Legislative Assembly of Madras met here in 1937. University convocations were also previously held here.  Madras High Court  The Madras High Court is the second largest judicial building in the world next only to the Courts of London. It is a good example of the Indo-Saracenic style and was completed in 1892.  National Art Gallery  The Victoria Memorial Hall built in 1906 by Henry Irwin is another example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. It was initially the location of the Victoria Technical Institute, later renamed as the National Art Gallery in 1951. It had about 175 collections of paintings from Rajasthan, Deccan, Tanjore, and Raja Ravi Varma, besides many bronze, wood, and ivory items from the British era. However, the art gallery is closed since 2002 as it is being renovated.Valluvar Kottam from the terrace of the exhibition hall  Valluvar Kottam  The Valluvar Kottam, constructed in 1976, is an auditorium in memory of the poet-saint Thiruvalluvar. All 1,330 verses of the poet's epic, the Thirukkural, are inscribed on the granite pillars that surround the auditorium. There is a 101-feet high temple chariot structure with a life-size image of the poet in it. The base of the chariot shows in bas-relief the 133 chapters of the Thirukkural.  Railway stations  There are a number of railway stations of interest in Chennai, primarily built throughout the colonial era. These include the Egmore station, the Royapuram station dating from 1856, the Chennai Central station dating from 1873 and the Southern Railway Headquarters built in 1922.  Other interesting buildings  The Government Museum (designed by Henry Irwin and completed in 1896) and the College of Engineering, Guindy are some more examples of the Indo- Saracenic style of architecture. Other buildings of architectural significance are the Presidency College, built in 1840, the Ripon Building (now housing the Chennai Corporation) dating from 1913, The War Memorial, Vivekanandar Illam, The Museum Theatre and the Ramakrishna Math temple. Adjoining the Governor's residence (Raj Bhavan) at Guindy, there are five mandapams (or memorials) dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, the first Indian Governor General C Rajagopalachari, former Chief Ministers of the state Kamaraj and Bhaktavatsalam and one to Martyrs in general. alt= Kanadukathan Chettinadu Palace entrance, Chettinadu architecture Inside of a typical chettinadu house, Chettinadu architecture  Chettinad architecture  Chettinad is a region located mainly in the Sivaganga district ruled by Ramnad kingdom of Pandya Nadu and has a small portion extending into the Pudukottai District of Chola Nadu in Tamil Nadu, India. The Chettinad region is well known for its 19th- century mansions, whose wide courtyards and spacious rooms are embellished with marble and teak. Construction materials, decorative items and furnishings were mostly imported from East Asian countries and Europe. The marble was brought from Italy, chandeliers and teak from Burma, crockery from Indonesia, crystals from Europe and wall-to-wall mirrors from Belgium. Many of these mansions were built using a type of limestone known as karai. Local legend has it that the mansion walls were polished with a paste made out of eggwhites to give them a smooth texture.  Post-Independence  After Independence, the state witnessed a rise in a blend of Modern and Traditional style of architecture. = Notable Post-Independence Buildings =  Gandhi Mandapam  Built in 1956, the Gandhi Mandapam is a set of memorials dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi and numerous other Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu. Its total area is 18 acres and it contains an amphitheater and a museum. The memorial is unique as it is modelled in the style of a South Indian temple.  Vivekananda Rock Memorial  The Vivekananda Rock Memorial was constructed in 1970 in the memory of Swami Vivekananda. It is located on an island near Kanyakumari next to the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Eknath Ranade, a social activist who was influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekananda, played a crucial role in the construction of the memorial. He also founded the Vivekananda Kendra adjacent to the memorial in 1972.  Thiruvalluvar Statue  Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Kanyakumari The Thiruvalluvar Statue, whose construction started in 1990 and completed in 1999, is a 133-feet high (statue height 95 feet erected on a 38 feet stone pedestal) dedicated to the Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar, who wrote Thirukkural, considered one of the greatest works in literature of morality and ethics. The height signifies the 133 chapters of Thirukkaral. The statue is located on an island near the southernmost city of mainland India, Kanyakumari. It was constructed by Ganapati Sthapati.

Maharashtra state in India is known for its caves and rock cut architecture. It is said that the varieties found in Maharashtra are wider than the caves and rock-cut architecture found in the rock cut areas of Egypt, Assyria, Persia and Greece. The Buddhist monks first started these caves in the 2nd century BC, in search of serene and peaceful environment for meditation, and they found these caves on the hillsides. Grishneshwar Temple was restored by Ahilyabai Holkar in the 18th century Buddhist and Hindu cave temples at Ellora and the Ajanta Caves contain fine artistic design elements and India's oldest wall paintings can be seen here. Maharashtra's famous rock-cut caves have several distinct artistic elements though sculptures of the time are regarded to modern viewers as stiff and not dynamic. The Buddhist caves, particularly the older ones, are either temples (Chaityas) or monasteries (Viharas). Ancient Mansar The oldest building in the state is Vakataka ruins in Mansar. Rock cut caves Rock-cut architecture took turn with the Buddhist reign and remarkable Buddhist monuments were produced in areas such as Bihar in the east and Maharashtra in the west. Natural grottos and caves in the hillside were excavated by the Buddhist monks and turned into glorious prayer halls and monasteries. Ranging from tiny monastic cells to colossal, elaborately carved temples, they are remarkable for having been hewn by hand from solid rock. Their 3rd century BC origins seem to have been as temporary shelters for Buddhist monks when heavy monsoon rains made their normal itinerant lifestyle impossible. Modeled on earlier wooden structures, most were sponsoions sit like a sceptre and crown amidst hills turned mauve. Medieval = Hindu = During the early medieval period, the Maharashtrian region's architecture was largely based on a combination of old and new Nagara styles styles. Bhimashankar temple is considered to be a unique mix of these two Nagara styles. During the late period, Hemadri a court polymath of Yadavas of Deogiri used his unique combinational Nagara style to create many temples, which were again rebuilt due to numerous Islamic clashes and their penchant for destroying Hindu places of worship. Foremost among these are Trayambakeshwar Temple, Tulja Bhavani temple, Ghrishneshwar temple among others. = Indo-Islamic = Some structures at the Daulatabad FortThe Daulatabad Fort itself was built by the Yadava dynasty in the 12th century CE, and the Indo-Islamic structures were added later by the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century CE. is the earliest examples of Indo-Islamic architecture in Maharashtra. The medieval Ahmednagar Sultanate built the Ahmednagar Fort, Tomb of Salabat Khan II and Bagh Rauza in Ahmednagar. Their style is similar to that of the other Deccan Sultanates. The best example of Mughal architecture in Maharashtra is Bibi ka Maqbara built by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, which is a replica of the Taj Mahal. = Maratha = The Maratha Empire ruled between the 17th and 19th centuries. They were constantly at war against the Mughal Empire. Therefore, several fortifications were built throughout the area, including Shaniwar Wada, Pratapgad, Raigad and Mangad. Shivaji built the Lal Mahal in Pune. During Confederacy era, many of the popular temples were built/revived all over Maharashtra. They reflect a peculiar architectural style regarded as Maratha Architecture. Colonial alt= Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu SangrahalayaThe name translates to \\"King Shivaji Museum\\" = Portuguese = During Portuguese rule in Mumbai, several fortifications, including the Madh Fort and Castella de Aguada were built in the city. = British Colonial = During the British colonial era, European styles became prevalent, especially in Mumbai. The most significant examples are the two World Heritage sites of Mumbai ‚Äï Chhatrappati Shivaji terminus (designed by Frederick William Stevens in the gothic revival style), and the Victorian and Art Deco ensemble of Mumbai (consisting of Bombay High Court, Rajabai Clock Tower and University of Mumbai).

He worked as a punchcutter and printer in Cologne, together with William Caxton, who may have financed his first books. They both left for Flanders in 1472. Evidence indicates that Veldener assisted Caxton in setting up his printing office in Bruges and helped printing his first work there, the 1472-1473 Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye by Raoul Lef√®vre. Afterwards, Veldener went to Leuven and set up his printing company there, becoming the second printer in Leuven after John of Westphalia, and the third or fourth in the Netherlands. He entered the Leuven University on 30 July 1473 in the faculty of Medicine. He left Leuven in 1477, after the death of Charles the Bold caused unrest in the city, and went to Utrecht. When that city also became troubled, he left for Culemborg, and finally returned to Leuven in 1484. Veldener was also known for creating typefaces, both for his own work and for others, and Caxton is believed to have taken one of Veldener's typefaces with him to England and used it among others on his first edition of the Canterbury Tales. It is probable that he later bought a number of other typefaces from Veldener as well. While in Utrecht, Veldener also supposedly wrote a Chronyck van Hollandt, Zeelandt, ende Westvrieslandt (a Chronicle of Holland, Sealand, and Western Friesland), which was reprinted in 1650 in Utrecht.

Rocks crashed through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. Shoham died of severe brain damage on 11 June 2001. This stoning attack and the infant's death, six days later, made headlines in Israel. Both incidents were part of a Second Intifada that started in September, 2000 and by 12 June 2001 had claimed the lives of 489 Palestinians and 109 Israelis. The attack The incident occurred as Benny and Batsheva Shoham and their only child Yehuda approached Eli after paying a shiva call in Ra'anana. Near Eli, Palestinians hiding at the roadside hurled rocks at the car which broke through the car's windscreen and crushed the infant's skull. The father continued driving, worried about an ambush, and at a nearby intersection, the couple noticed their baby's head injuries. Batsheva performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Yehuda until the arrival of paramedics. Yehuda was taken to an intensive care unit at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where he lay unconscious and with severe head injuries. He was attached to a respirator for nearly a week before dying of severe brain damage on 11 July. During his time in the hospital, Yehuda's parents gave him a second name, \\"Chaim,\\" which means life, hoping that he would live. While in the hospital, Yehuda was visited by then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Background The Second Intifada, which began 8 months earlier, marked a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence. On 22 May, Sharon declared a unilateral ceasefire and refrained from retaliating against Palestinian attacks. On Friday, 1 June, a suicide bombing outside a Tel Aviv disco occurred which killed 21 people, mainly Israeli teenagers who had immigrated from Russia. The day after, Saturday, June 2, Yasser Arafat's call for a cease-fire staved off Israeli retaliation.Mark Lavie, \\"U.S. sending CIA director for security talks\\", Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, 6 June 2001. Aftermath In the meantime, Israel took a variety of measures to reduce tension, with Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer citing a \\"significant reduction in the number of attacks\\". Though Palestinians would be subject to strict closure confining them to their towns, Israel eased some travel restrictions and Palestinians were to be allowed to return from Jordan and Egypt, raw materials would be permitted to enter and exit the Palestinian territories, and Palestinians would be allowed to return to their jobs in an industrial zone near the Erez crossing point. Palestinian security commanders traveled to trouble spots in the Gaza Strip to consult with local officers over the cease-fire enforcement. When news of Yehuda's wounding spread on Tuesday, 5 June, far-right settlers urged Ariel Sharon to retaliate. The incident angered Israel's 200,000 settlers who urged Ariel Sharon to end Israel's \\"policy of restraint\\", and abandon the ceasefire. The Independent suggested that the incident would be cited by many Israelis as reason for stepping up military measures. The morning after Yehuda's wounding, at least 300 settlers, arriving in buses, assailed two villages adjacent to Shiloh, Assawiya, and Luban al-Sharkiya, which lay under curfew and within Israel's security responsibility, and, according to B'tselem, in the presence of, and according to local testimony, with the assistance of the IDF, fired a wheat harvest, a hothouse, a carpentry shop and a school, stole tools and shot a Palestinian youth in the stomachRon Dudai,\\"Free Rein: Vigilante Settlers and Israel's Non-Enforcement of the Law\\", B'tselem, October 2001, pp 9-11:'Israeli security forces were present throughout the events but did not prevent the violence. In fact, they prevented Palestinians from defending themselves, and even joined the settlers in their violence. Testimonies given to B‚ÄôTselem indicate that the soldiers also prohibited fire engines and ambulances from reaching the scene.' or the leg. There were rock-throwing battles between settlers and Palestinians at the site of the attack on the Shohams' car during which one Israeli and seven Palestinians were injured. In addition, settlers in Hebron also attacked local Palestinian shopkeepers. The settlers had been a focal target of Palestinian militancy during an eight-month uprising. Two settlers were arrested by Israeli police as a result of the riots. Though reluctant to become involved in the conflict, the U.S. dispatched C.I.A. director George Tenet, who was scheduled to meet separately with the Israeli and Palestinian sides on Thursday, June 7, in order to re-establish co- operation on security issues between the two parties, which had broken down after the IDF had shot at the car of the Gaza Strip security chief Mohammad Dahlan in mid-April, and had fired on the home of their West Bank security chief Jibril Rajoub in late May. Tenet's visit backed up an effort by the European Union to seize on Arafat's declaration in order to transform the ceasefire into a genuine halt to the reciprocal blood-letting. On Wednesday, 6 June, the eve of Tenet's scheduled visit, the IDF announced it would award medals to the commanders and troops serving at Netzarim Junction, where the child, Mohammed al-Dura had been shot dead. The news was seen as a blow to the restoration of trust. Thousands of demonstrators protested in Jerusalem against what they termed Sharon's \\"restraint policy\\". That same evening, Palestinians were outraged when Sharon called Arafat a \\"murderer\\" and \\"pathological liar\\" in an interview addressing the Russian community that had been angered at his failure to retaliate for the disco bombing. The broadcast was carried on Israeli television. Though given the red-carpet treatment abroad, he added, Arafat did not act like a head of state but rather like the chief of terrorists and murderers. On Thursday, 7 June, speaking to reporters at a rally urging Ariel Sharon to retaliate for the attack on Yehuda and other recent attacks, Yehuda's father said \\"Unfortunately, our government is showing a lot of weakness in its response to terrorism\\". He also declared: > This is our land, these are our roads, and if we are afraid of driving to > Tel Aviv [Tel Aviv] and Netanya [Netanya] also. Negotiations, funeral and reactions Tenet's meeting with both sides was postponed until Sunday, June 10, after the Americans realized the extent of their differences. Matters were buffeted by the killing of three Bedouin women, struck by Israeli tank shells while in their tents in the Gaza Strip over the weekend, and the critical injuries sustained by an Islamic Jihad member in a car-bombing, which the group suspected as being the work of Israel.Mid-East ceasefire talks break up, BBC News 11 Monday 2001. He proposed that Israel desist from attacking Palestinian targets and withdraw to the positions they held on 28 September 2000. He asked Palestinians to thwart attacks on Israeli positions, to end what Israelis view as incitement in the media, and to proceed to arrest militant gunmen. On Monday, 11 June, the day Yehuda died, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres met the Palestinian minister for international co-operation, Nabil Shaath in Luxembourg to explore a compromise. Tenet eventually presided over a tense 4-hour meeting the following day, which was broken off after the gaps failed to be bridged. The Israelis insisted on the arrest of people they suspected of terrorism before they would allow a cooling-off period, while the Palestinians demanded that security arrangements be followed by an Israeli pledge to freeze to all construction in settlements in the occupied territories. The Palestinians refused to conduct what they called arbitrary arrests. The chief of staff of the Israeli army, General Shaul Mofaz, called the truce itself an optical illusion. The funeral procession for Yehuda began with settlers gathering in front of Ariel Sharon's office in Jerusalem with the child's body carried before them. As Sharon stepped up to a podium to address them, settlers shouted \\"Vengeance!\\" and \\"Go to war\\". Prime Minister Sharon spoke to the funeral procession outside his office, and, acknowledging the settlers' impatience with a ceasefire, said: > If we stand firm and grit our teeth, and carry on even when the tears are > choking us, we will win... I am not here to make a speech, but to weep, to > weep together with you. May the memory of Yehuda be blessed. Sharon also asked for prayers for the infant, and accused the Palestinian Authority of inciting violence. From there the procession walked to the northern West Bank settlement of Shilo where Yehuda was buried. One of Yehuda's cousins said, \\"Yehuda was just a baby, without sin or enemy, yet he was killed for one reason only, he was a Jew on his way home in Eretz Yisrael [Eretz Yisrael].\\" In a letter to the United Nations, Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Yehuda Lancry outlined Israel's position, which affirmed that the death of Yehuda Shoham constituted a ‚Äúreprehensible act of terrorism‚Äù that took place just over two weeks after Israel had declared that it would refrain from initiating military action against Palestinians, and barely a week after Yassir Arafat had undertaken to fight violence and terrorism. In Yehuda's memory, his parents decided to collect donations for dormitories at the yeshiva in Shiloh. His parents also established the Yehuda Fund in January 2002 \\"in their son's memory.\\" See also * Murder of Helena Rapp * Murder of Shalhevet Pass * Murder of Tali Hatuel and her four daughters * Murder of Ofir Rahum * Death of Asher and Yonatan Palmer * Children in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict References Category:Terrorism deaths in the West Bank Category:People murdered in the Palestinian territories Category:Murdered Israeli children Category:Children in war Category:Deaths by person in Asia Category:Israeli terrorism victims Category:Deaths by rocks thrown at cars Category:Palestinian stone-throwing ","title":"Death of Yehuda Shoham"},{"id":"36665115","text":"Manauna is a village at Aonla tehseel in Bareilly district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.

It is celebrated during March after completion of their most arduous task of jhum operation i.e., jungle-clearing (clearing of the remnants of burning). It is a spring festival celebrated with great favour and gaiety. Origins and history Chapchar Kut is estimated to have started in 1450‚Äì1700 A.D. in a village called Suaipui. The festival apparently originated when the hunters came back to the village empty handed, to make up for the disappointment, the Village chief proposed an impromptu feast with rice beer and meat. Since then, everyone the festival had been repeated by the village of Suaipui and spread on to other villages. Chapchar Kut was first revived in 1962 on a grand scale in Aizawl, however it was discouraged when it was felt that it did not adhere to Christian values and rekindling the pre Christian cultural practices like drinking of rice beer, however, it was continued in 1973 on a mass scale sans animistic practice and cheraw dance. Even the Church which had remined critical of the festival no longer objected to the festival as it felt that traditional culture was disappearing. Chapchar Kut is now held annually in the Month of March. People dance, perform skits, play musical instruments to celebrate their beloved festival with the aims of bringing camaraderie among the people. Chapchar Kut is one of three annual festivals of the Mizos celebrated to mark three different stages of the agricultural cycle. The other two are Mim Kut and Pawl Kut, also revived in the last century. Celebration Chapchar Kut cheraw dance, Mizoram, 2014 Oral traditions say Chapchar Kut was first celebrated in Seipui village in adjoining Myanmar that has a sizeable population of Mizos and their ethnic cousins. Chapchar Kut used to be celebrated to thank the gods for saving the people from harm during the clearing of forest on hill slopes for jhum cultivation at the beginning of a year. The festival used to be observed with a lot of drinking and eating. On the first night the young men and women would dance all night. The women would come dressed wearing a Vakiria. Chai dance has its origins in this festival. Cheraw dance is performed during Chapchar Kut. Today, the festival is observed in the last part of February or the early part of March when the trees and bamboos felled for jhum are left to dry and the shifting cultivators have time to relax and enjoy. The Main activities which are done during the Chapachar Kut are: * Chhawnghnawh - A pre-Christian custom of stuffing a boiled eggs into each other's mouths. * Dance - Cheraw dance is the Main dance but other dances performed during the festival are Khuallam, Chheihlam, Chai and Sarlamkai * Arts, craft and Photo Exhibition. * Chapchar Kut run. * Mizo Traditional Games and costume parade. * Wearing of Traditional dress at work places. * Stalls with Etnnic cuisine.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Semiƒç municipal site Its territory is now part of the village of Sredgora. It lies in a narrow dry valley 1 km east of Sredgora.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 61. Name The name Topliƒçice and names like it (e.g., Dolenjske Toplice) are derived from the Slovene common noun *toplica 'hot spring', referring to a local geological feature.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 431. The German name T√∂plitzel and Gottscheerish name Teplitzle are derived from the Slovenian name. Both the Slovene and German names are diminutives (with the suffixes -ice and -el), also reflected in the obsolete Slovene name Male Toplice, all literally 'little hot spring(s)'. The diminutive form may have also helped differentiate the settlement from many others named Toplice/T√∂plitz.Bleier, Reinhard. 1982. \\"Unerkannte Siedlungsnamenherkunft in Gottscheer Familiennamen.\\" Beitr√§ge zur Namenforschung 18: 391‚Äì432, p. 392.

Ljubljana: Zveza za tujski promet za Slovenijo, p. 126. and so it may have developed later as a settlement founded under the Counts of Blagay. It had six houses in 1750. Before the Second World War, the village had four houses and a population of 17. The forest railway between Rog and ƒårnomelj ran near the village. The population made a living by selling wood, raising livestock, and some viticulture, with vineyards located in Rodine. The original inhabitants were evicted from the village in the fall of 1941. It was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and was never rebuilt. The ruins of the village are now registered as cultural heritage.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 19506 Church A chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Martin stood in the village. The church dated back to at least 1610, when its 80 kg bell was cast. As such, the church was the oldest known cultural monument in the Parish of Planina ().

The E R Burrowes School of Art, an undergraduate institution accredited by the University of Guyana, is named after him. Early years Burrowes was born in Barbados in 1903, of African origin. He arrived in Guyana as a young child. His father worked for the privately owned Daily Chronicle. After his father's death, the family had little money to live on. When Burrowes left primary school he became a tailor's apprentice. He continued to study from books, and passed examinations in English Language and Literature, English History, and Scripture. He passed the City and Guilds examinations at an unusually young age, and was able to open his own tailoring shop. Artist and teacher Burrowes was interested in art from an early age, and had natural talent. Unable to afford to buy paints, he worked out how to make them using tailor's chalk. He was a frequent visitor to the Georgetown Museum, and was fascinated by the Indian artefacts and displays of Guyanese geology that he saw there. The British Guiana Arts and Crafts Society (BGACS) was formed in 1932, and Burrowes became a member. The established BGACS members were impressed by the talent he displayed in his landscape and genre paintings. The latter depicted working-class people in everyday scenes. Burrowes began teaching Working Peoples' Free Art Class, which influenced artists such as Dr Denis Williams. His goal was to give ordinary working people an opportunity to develop their artistic talents. Burrowes founded the WPAC in 1948. In 1949 he received a British Council scholarship which let him attend the Brighton College of Art, where he specialised in block printing. When he returned after a year, he was appointed Art teacher at the Government Teachers' Training College. In the 1954 New Year Honours, Burrowes was appointed a Member of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire for services to art in British Guiana. In 1956 he was teaching Art and Art History at Queen's College. He died aged 63 in 1966. Achievements In 1947, Donald Locke attended a class taught in Georgetown by Burrowes, which inspired him to take up painting. Writing about Burrowes in the 1966 Guyana Independence Issue of New World, Locke describes how Burrowes was constantly engaged in \\"technical exploration\\", including making his own paints from unlikely ingredients and conducting experiments \\"with balata, buckram, tailor's canvas, rice bags, bitumen, concrete and ... clay mixed with molasses.\\" Denis Williams called him \\"the Barbadian who fathered the plastic arts in Guyana in terms of a European ancestry.\\" The WPAC helped a number of Guyanese artists at the start of their career. Stanley Greaves attended the WPAC with Locke as a teenager and later became well known. Emerson Samuels was another artist who studied at the WPAC. The painter Aubrey Williams studied with E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class after returning from a two-year term with the Agriculture department in which he had lived with indigenous people in the jungle. In 1987, Williams described Burrowes as \\"a genius\\" who \\"opened the Guyanese eyes to art, in its aesthetic sense\\".

This is a festival observed in December for two days. Origin The origin of Pawl Kut dates back to a period when people of Mizoram used to live near the River Tiau around 1450 to 1700 AD. A severe famine occurred for three continuous years. On the fourth year, there was a bumper crop. Thus people celebrate Pawl Kut as an act of thanksgiving to the Almighty for giving a bountiful harvest. Celebration Meat and egg form a customary part of the feast for the festival. A ritual known as Chawnghnawt is observed during the festival. During Chawnghnawt ritual mother and her children are made to sit on a memorial platform constructed specially for the purpose of Pawl Kut.
