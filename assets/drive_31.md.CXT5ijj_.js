Types in univalent foundations do not correspond exactly to anything in set-theoretic foundations, but they may be thought of as spaces, with equal types corresponding to homotopy equivalent spaces and with equal elements of a type corresponding to points of a space connected by a path. Univalent foundations are inspired both by the old Platonic ideas of Hermann Grassmann and Georg Cantor and by \\"categorical\\" mathematics in the style of Alexander Grothendieck. Univalent foundations depart from the use of classical predicate logic as the underlying formal deduction system, replacing it, at the moment, with a version of Martin-L√∂f type theory. The development of univalent foundations is closely related to the development of homotopy type theory. Univalent foundations are compatible with structuralism, if an appropriate (i.e., categorical) notion of mathematical structure is adopted. History The main ideas of univalent foundations were formulated by Vladimir Voevodsky during the years 2006 to 2009. The sole reference for the philosophical connections between univalent foundations and earlier ideas are Voevodsky's 2014 Bernays lectures. See item 11 at Voevodsky Lectures The name \\"univalence\\" is due to Voevodsky.univalence axiom in nLab A more detailed discussion of the history of some of the ideas that contribute to the current state of univalent foundations can be found at the page on homotopy type theory. A fundamental characteristic of univalent foundations is that they ‚Äî when combined with the Martin-L√∂f type theory ‚Äî provide a practical system for formalization of modern mathematics. A considerable amount of mathematics has been formalized using this system and modern proof assistants such as Coq and Agda. The first such library called \\"Foundations\\" was created by Vladimir Voevodsky in 2010.Foundations library, see https://github.com/vladimirias/Foundations Now Foundations is a part of a larger development with several authors called UniMath.UniMath library, see https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath Foundations also inspired other libraries of formalized mathematics, such as the HoTT Coq libraryHoTT Coq library, see https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT and HoTT Agda library,HoTT Agda library, see https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda that developed univalent ideas in new directions. An important milestone for univalent foundations was the Bourbaki Seminar talk by Thierry CoquandCoquand's Bourbaki Lecture Paper and Video in June 2014. Main concepts Univalent foundations originated from certain attempts to create foundations of mathematics based on higher category theory. The closest earlier ideas to univalent foundations were the ideas that Michael Makkai expressed in his visionary paper known as FOLDS. The main distinction between univalent foundations and the foundations envisioned by Makkai is the recognition that \\"higher dimensional analogs of sets\\" correspond to infinity groupoids and that categories should be considered as higher-dimensional analogs of partially ordered sets. Originally, univalent foundations were devised by Vladimir Voevodsky with the goal of enabling those who work in classical pure mathematics to use computers to verify their theorems and constructions. The fact that univalent foundations are inherently constructive was discovered in the process of writing the Foundations library (now part of UniMath). At present, in univalent foundations, classical mathematics is considered to be a \\"retract\\" of constructive mathematics, i.e., classical mathematics is both a subset of constructive mathematics consisting of those theorems and constructions that use the law of the excluded middle as their assumption and a \\"quotient\\" of constructive mathematics by the relation of being equivalent modulo the axiom of the excluded middle. In the formalization system for univalent foundations that is based on Martin-L√∂f type theory and its descendants such as Calculus of Inductive Constructions, the higher dimensional analogs of sets are represented by types. The collection of types is stratified by the concept of h-level (or homotopy level).See Types of h-level 0 are those equal to the one point type. They are also called contractible types. Types of h-level 1 are those in which any two elements are equal. Such types are called \\"propositions\\" in univalent foundations. The definition of propositions in terms of the h-level agrees with the definition suggested earlier by Awodey and Bauer. So, while all propositions are types, not all types are propositions. Being a proposition is a property of a type that requires proof. For example, the first fundamental construction in univalent foundations is called iscontr. It is a function from types to types. If X is a type then iscontr X is a type that has an object if and only if X is contractible. It is a theorem (which is called, in the UniMath library, isapropiscontr) that for any X the type iscontr X has h-level 1 and therefore being a contractible type is a property. This distinction between properties that are witnessed by objects of types of h-level 1 and structures that are witnessed by objects of types of higher h-levels is very important in the univalent foundations. Types of h-level 2 are called sets. It is a theorem that the type of natural numbers has h-level 2 (isasetnat in UniMath). It is claimed by the creators of univalent foundations that the univalent formalization of sets in Martin-L√∂f type theory is the best currently- available environment for formal reasoning about all aspects of set- theoretical mathematics, both constructive and classical. Categories are defined (see the RezkCompletion library in UniMath) as types of h-level 3 with an additional structure that is very similar to the structure on types of h-level 2 that defines partially ordered sets. The theory of categories in univalent foundations is somewhat different and richer than the theory of categories in the set-theoretic world with the key new distinction being that between pre-categories and categories.See An account of the main ideas of univalent foundations and their connection to constructive mathematics can be found in a tutorial by Thierry Coquand (part 1, part 2). A presentation of the main ideas from the perspective of classical mathematics can be found in the review article by Alvaro Pelayo and Michael Warren, as well as in the introduction by Daniel Grayson. See also the article about the Foundations library. Current developments An account of Voevodsky's construction of a univalent model of the Martin-L√∂f type theory with values in Kan simplicial sets can be found in a paper by Chris Kapulkin, Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine and Vladimir Voevodsky. Univalent models with values in the categories of inverse diagrams of simplicial sets were constructed by Michael Shulman. These models have shown that the univalence axiom is independent from the excluded middle axiom for propositions. Voevodsky's model is considered to be non-constructive since it uses the axiom of choice in an ineliminable way. The problem of finding a constructive interpretation of the rules of the Martin-L√∂f type theory that in addition satisfies the univalence axiom and canonicity for natural numbers remains open. A partial solution is outlined in a paper by Marc Bezem, Thierry Coquand and Simon Huber with the key remaining issue being the computational property of the eliminator for the identity types. The ideas of this paper are now being developed in several directions including the development of the cubical type theory. New directions Most of the work on formalization of mathematics in the framework of univalent foundations is being done using various sub-systems and extensions of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. There are three standard problems whose solution, despite many attempts, could not be constructed using CIC: # To define the types of semi-simplicial types, H-types or (infty,1)-category structures on types. # To extend CIC with a universe management system that would allow implementation of the resizing rules. # To develop a constructive variant of the Univalence AxiomV. Voevodsky, Univalent Foundations Project (a modified version of an NSF grant application), p. 9 These unsolved problems indicate that while CIC is a good system for the initial phase of the development of the univalent foundations, moving towards the use of computer proof assistants in the work on its more sophisticated aspects will require the development of a new generation of formal deduction and computation systems.

He established the Union County Human Relations Commission that fought against hate crimes in the county. In 1992 he formed the Essex-Union County Auto Theft Task Force which led to a 20% reduction in motor vehicle thefts in the Newark, New Jersey metropolitan area. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey from 1981 to 1984. Biography He was born in Westfield, New Jersey on November 5, 1952, to Claire E. Murphy and Dr. Andrew Keogh Ruotolo Sr., a psychiatrist. While at Westfield High School, he was named to the All-America swimming team. He was a 1974 graduate of Amherst College and a 1978 graduate of Fordham University Law School. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey from 1981 to 1984, where he worked in the Criminal Division. In 1985, he was the Democratic candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in the Union County-based 21st Legislative District, losing to incumbent Republican Assemblymen Chuck Hardwick and Peter J. Genova by more than 14,000 votes. Governor Jim Florio appointed him to serve as Prosecutor in 1991, following the death of John H. Stamler. As the Union County, New Jersey prosecutor he created the Union County Human Relations Commission to combat bias and hate crimes, and established his office's first full-time Domestic Violence Unit and the Union County Child Advocacy Center. In 1992 he proposed the Essex-Union County Auto Theft Task Force with James F. Mulvihill, the Essex County, New Jersey prosecutor. On the motor vehicle theft problem he said: \\"You have impoverished youth growing up in a society that measures your value by what kind of car you drive ... these youngsters have the ability to steal expensive cars that they feel gives them instant status in their community ... you give me 100 [new jail] beds and I'll cut the car theft problem in Newark in half\\". The task force made hundreds of arrests for motor vehicle theft. This led to a 20 percent reduction in motor vehicle thefts in the Newark, New Jersey metropolitan area. In 1995 he the Union County Child Advocacy Center, in Elizabeth, as a shelter for victims of child abuse. He was diagnosed with cancer in March 1995. On the subject he said: \\"Being with a child at a school concert becomes more important than sitting at a dinner table with the governor, especially for a public person.\\" He died of esophageal cancer on September 21, 1995 in Westfield, New Jersey. Legacy The New Jersey County Prosecutor's Association has created the Andrew K. Ruotolo, Jr. Memorial Scholarship, a need-based scholarship for students admitted to law school. His widow, Mary P. Ruotolo, served as a Union County Freeholder from 1998 to 2004. He had three children with his wife Mary: Lyndsay, Andrew Keogh Ruotolo III, and Jayne.

Neo-Sumerian art is a period in the art of Mesopotamia made during the Third Dynasty of Ur or Neo-Sumerian period, c. 2112 BC ‚Äì c. 2004 BC, in Southern Mesopotamia (modern- day Iraq). It is known mostly for the revival of the Sumerian stylistic qualities and was centered around royalty and divinity. The art of the Neo- Sumerian period was also influenced by the Akkadians, whose period of rule preceded this. Many large temples and ziggurats were built in this period, most of which possessed monumental staircases. These staircases were probably thought to be used by divinity, for ascending and descending between heaven and Earth. The temple at the bottom of the stairs was created as a home for the god/gods that the temple worshiped. As for Neo-Sumerian sculptures, the many prayer statues of Gudea were the most common for this period, although in fact his reign ended a few years before the Third Dynasty of Ur. Usually these statues would present the patesi (see also, Ensi), with a shaved head and face, and wearing a monk like robe. The statues of human figures of the Neo- Sumerian period were known for their distinct eyebrows, lips, and fingers. Overall, the architecture, as well as the sculpture of the Neo-Sumerians, presented a strong theme of serene majesty and intense religious fervor. Other themes that were characteristic of Neo-Sumerian art are the themes of force and power, the creation of a strong capital, and religious ceremonial artifacts. Architecture Ziggurat of Ur Neo-Sumerian architecture was mostly based on the materials that were available in that demographic area. For this area, quality materials were not available so the people had to settle for tall reeds from marshes and mud-brick developments for housing and more permanent structures. There were many stages of architectural development and temple design. These designs started as basic ideas that progressed into more advanced designs. Beginning structures based on the primitive blueprints have small shrines, measuring only 12 ft x 15 ft, with one offering table in front of the niche. Many early temples were structured this way. In later years, old temples were strengthened and enlarged by adding buttresses. Typical characteristics of Neo-Sumerian temples were that they were located on top of ziggurats, a man-made mountain, and were the places where a god would be expected. Levels of elevation and staging were also typical characteristics of both temples and ziggurats. The name of the Neo- Sumerian specific ziggurat is the Ziggurat of Ur. Statues of Gudea Gudea had many sculptures made resembling him during his life (now numbered from A to AA). They are all similar varying from the ruler standing or seated, folded hands, bare-headed or wearing a wool hat. They are all made from diorite, which could only be carved and finished by few. Gudea‚Äôs son, Ningirsu, had many statues made of him during his reign. They also closely resembled his fathers. Female figures are very rare. They are sculpted with the same master craftsmanship as Gudea‚Äôs. This proves they were probably made for a woman of royalty or otherwise of great importance. Much of the art was hard to put on a timeline. There was a, ‚Äúlack of archeological context.‚Äù Statue N of Gudea of Lagash, Louvre The first example is the Statue of Patesi (governor) He was the 7th Patesi and ruled for over 15 years. He is seen dressed like a monk in a robe that shows his bare shoulders and right arm. The hands in these sculptures are always shown clasped in prayer. The details in the features, like the fingertips and facial features, is noticed more because of the simplicity of the robe. The contrast gives the smaller details more importance. The next piece is a Female statue representation. Her hands are in the same position as those of Gudea. She is dressed in a robe and shawl covered with embroidered ribbons. Her curly hair is covered with a cloth headdress with a ribbon. The importance grows as we see her hands are also clasped in prayer. There is also a statue of Gudea holding a jar of water. It is from 2100 BCE and is made from calcite. It stands about 2 ¬Ω feet tall. Many sculptures are found with inscriptions by the ruler. This figure is seen with the inscription, ‚ÄúI am the shepherd loved by my king (Ningirsu) may my life be prolonged,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGudea, the builder of the temple, has been given life.‚Äù Each part of the body is made for a specific reason. The large chest of Gudea shows us Gods have given him the fullness of life. The muscular arms show us Gods have given him strength. The large eyes signify his gaze is fixed on the gods. He is holding a jar of flowing water, with swimming fish. The water and fish are coming out in 2 streams that run down the sides of his robe. Gods and goddesses are often portrayed the same way, holding similar jars overflowing with water. It known to symbolize the prosperity they bring their people. Other pieces The so-called Libation Cup of Gudea in the Louvre is made of soapstone. It was a goblet used in religious ceremonies. Despite the humanization of gods, this is clear evidence monsters did not completely disappear. On the cup there are 2 standing dragons holding a spear with their front legs. They are scary looking monsters with snakeheads, feline bodies, eagle‚Äôs wings and claws, and a scorpion‚Äôs tail. Both of the monsters guard a cane on which two serpents whose heads ascend to the rim of the cup. The emblem their shape creates is known as the emblem of pharmacy and medicine (See also, Rod of Asclepius). A female head of alabaster of c. 2100 BCE from Ur is in the Penn Museum (Museum of the University of Pennsylvania) in Philadelphia. It has been identified with a Neo-Sumerian princess and also with the goddess Ningal. She wears a large smooth circular head band colored gold to hold her hair. The bottom half of her face is missing due to natural wear and tear from aging. The eyes are still vibrant. They are inlaid with lapis lazuli. The head is made with the rare and costly dark stone, diorite.

Only 49 years old, Weintraub left behind a legacy of research.  Early life and education  Born on June 2, 1945, in Newark, New Jersey, Weintraub's childhood revolved around sports, including basketball, an activity he would continue to particularly relish throughout his adult life. Weintraub was also the pitcher for an all-city high school baseball team, and a football fullback. Weintraub attended Harvard College, obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1967. He then proceeded to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his M.D. and Ph.D. in 1972. Weintraub performed his Ph.D. dissertation research in the laboratory of Howard Holtzer, studying red blood cell development and production (erythropoeisis) in chicken embryos. This work included the study of cell cycle kinetics, hemoglobin synthesis, and the control of cell division. The effects of bromodeoxyuridine on cell differentiation (conversion of a primitive cell into a more specialized cell) were also analyzed. While still only a graduate student, Weintraub's early work contributed significantly to the fields of developmental and cellular biology, yielding numerous peer- reviewed publications and setting the stage for the next chapter in his research explorations.  Research achievements  During his abbreviated career, Weintraub was the author of more than 130 scientific articles, most of which were in top-tier, peer-reviewed journals, including the \\"Big 3\\" basic science journals: Cell, Science, and Nature. Weintraub was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and served as editorial advisor for numerous journals. Weintraub spent approximately a year at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, England, doing a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratories of Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick. There, his studies of the nucleosome ‚Äî a basic unit of DNA packaging ‚Äî showed that its structure was altered when genes were actively transcribed. Weintraub returned to the United States, and between the years 1973‚Äì1977 was an assistant professor at Princeton University. His research at Princeton, which would continue during his years in Seattle, applied enzymatic and traditional biochemical isolation/separation techniques to clarify the relationship between the physical structure of genes and their expression (the process by which DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA, and eventually into Protein.) Another avenue of research in Weintraub's lab studied the effects of oncoviruses on cellular gene expression. In 1978, Weintraub joined the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), established in 1971 as an independent affiliate of the University of Washington (UW), Seattle. He was a founding member of the Basic Sciences Division, and professor of genetics at UW. As described in an essay by Marc Kirschner, one of his former colleagues at Princeton, \\"When most of us left [Princeton] in the late 1970s, Hal, typically concerned more with research opportunity than with glamour, went to a young research institution where the practice of science would be paramount.\\" Weintraub remained at \\"the Hutch\\" (the nickname for FHCRC) until his death in 1995. In addition, from 1990 to 1995 Weintraub was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. While at FHCRC, Weintraub continued and extended his prior studies of chromatin structure and function. Another of his contributions was developing the technique of using antisense RNA to create specific mutant phenotypes in vertebrate organisms. Perhaps the work for which Weintraub is best known was his laboratory's discovery and characterization of \\"myoD\\", the first master regulatory gene. When expressed, the myoD gene produces a protein referred to as MyoD (or MyoD1), which can bind certain DNA sequences, stop cell division, and elicit an entire program of muscle cell differentiation. In a series of sequential experiments, Weintraub and his students showed that myoD was able to convert fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) into myoblasts (skeletal muscle cells). Later studies by the same group of investigators at FHCRC further characterized the structural and functional characteristics of myoD and its nuclear-localized protein product, which were found to be present in organisms as diverse as nematode worms, frogs, mice, and humans. During the final years of his life, Weintraub's work used myoD to delve broadly and deeply into the areas of regulatory proteins, gene expression, and the molecular control of cell differentiation. As part of this work, his lab pioneered a molecular biology technique known as the Selection And Amplification Binding (SAAB) assay, which is used to find the DNA-binding sites for proteins. Biotechnology involvement Along with chemist Peter Dervan of Caltech and developmental biologist Doug Melton of Harvard, Weintraub was one of three core scientific advisors to Michael L. Riordan, founder of Gilead Sciences, helping to establish the company's scientific vision at its founding during the late 1980s. Death and legacy Weintraub died on March 28, 1995, in Seattle, Washington, as a result of complications from glioblastoma multiforme, a very aggressive and fast-growing brain tumor. He had only been diagnosed six months beforehand, undergoing neurosurgery in an attempt to curb its spread. Weintraub was survived by his wife and two sons. In the years that followed, several items were created in his memory: *the Fred Hutch Weintraub and Groudine Fund: ‚Äúestablished to foster intellectual exchange through the promotion of programs for graduate students, fellows and visiting scholars.‚Äù *the Weintraub meeting, held annually since 1997, is a two-day symposium serving as a reunion for Weintraub's former graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and scientific collaborators. *the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award, initiated at FHCRC in 2000, occurs annually, honoring Weintraub and his commitment to innovative science, and recognizing outstanding achievement during graduate studies in the biological sciences. Students are nominated by their department/program chairperson, and submit their CV, a one-page description of their thesis work, and a recommendation letter from their research mentor. Those accepted participate in a one-day symposium, giving presentations and interacting with other students and faculty. A selection committee made up of FHCRC faculty and students select up to twelve awardees from those nominated, on the basis of quality, originality, and significance of their work, as well as to represent a broad range of research topics.

He was educated at Halle where he studied under Carl Brockelmann and Paul Kahle, then at Strasbourg under Carl Heinrich Becker. He then served as a military interpreter during World War One in Iraq, Palestine and Iran. In 1919 he became a teaching assistant at the University of Hamburg, researching classical Arabic literature and Greek and medieval alchemy. But his academic career in Germany was effectively ended in 1925 when he was convicted for homosexuality.Entry on \\"Ritter, Hellmut\\" in the Deutsche Biographie Being dismissed from his post in early 1926, he went to Istanbul. =Istanbul (1926-1949)= In Istanbul Ritter realised the city's ancient libraries held a wealth of manuscripts and literary treasures that lay moldering and unregarded. He began work on a series of scholarly articles, which he had published in the series Philologika; Issue I - Gustav Fl√ºgel's 1870 unfinished translation work on the tenth century encyclopedia of Ibn al-Nadim, entitled Al-Fihrist; Issue VII - edited translations of Arabic and Persian treatises on profane and mystical love; Issue VIII - An·π£ƒÅri Haravi and SanƒÅ æi ·∏†aznavi; Issue X - Farid-al-din  øA·π≠·π≠ƒÅr; Issue XI - JalƒÅl-al-Din Rumi; Issues XIV-XVI -  øA·π≠·π≠ƒÅr. He also discovered the original text of the fantasy anthology Tales of the Marvellous and News of the Strange.Robert Irwin, \\"The earliest known Arabic short stories in the world have just been translated into English for the first time\\", Independent, 13 Nov 2014 Despite his effective exile from Germany, he was head of the German Orientalist Society in Istanbul and his scholarly work had some supporters in Germany. This support enabled the funding of his proposed Bibliotheca Islamica series of scholarly monographs from 1929 onwards. In the early 1930s he worked on early Arabic alchemical manuscripts, among others, and also pioneered the understanding of the influence of Ancient Greek literature on Arabic culture and science. The election of the Nazi Party in Germany in 1933 meant that Ritter's contract for work was ended, but friends in the German Orientalist Society quietly managed to find a small amount of funding that enabled his work to continue. Then a new and local opportunity arose, due to Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's rapid modernisation of Istanbul and Turkey. Thus the newly improved and re-organised Istanbul University asked Ritter to work as a professor. Despite working on a temporary contract, Ritter was tasked with raising a new generation of Turkish scholars, able to work with rigour on the region's ancient literature. The Swiss orientalist Fritz Meier was also among his students in Istanbul. Ritter pursued the work with vigour, making his students learn a new language each year. =Germany (1949-1956)= After the defeat of the Nazis in World War Two Ritter was able to return to Germany in 1949, and this enabled the completion of his most important work: the encyclopaedic manual on the rituals and beliefs of Islamic mysticism Das Meer der Seele (1955 in German). From 1953 he found work as a teaching assistant at the Frankfurt University Institute of Oriental Studies. But homosexuality in Germany was at that time still criminal, and in 1956 he returned again to Istanbul. =Istanbul (1956-1969)= Upon his return to Turkey Ritter began work at the Istanbul University on a UNESCO-funded project to catalogue the scattered ancient poetry manuscripts in the various city archives. By 1960 Ritter's early sympathies with the mystical orders of Islam and his and assiduous gathering of their MS texts ensured their survival. In the 1920s just prior to Ataturk's official ban of dancing rituals Ritter had recorded the rituals directly from the key dance-masters of Istanbul. The subsequent restoration of these rituals in 1960 relied heavily on Ritter's accurate recordings and interviews for success. Ritter's scholarship, and practice as a musician, helped establish his authority as leader of the field. In his last years he documented a small group of elderly refugees, who were ancient Aramaic native speakers - a language considered endangered - and with whom he prepared a five-volume Aramaic dictionary and guide to the grammar. =Germany (1969-1971)= Ritter returned to Germany in 1969 and died on May 19, 1971 in Oberursel.

Paintings of fairies had a resurgence of popularity in the 19th century with many based on scenes from A Midsummer Night's Dream and Simmons produced several pieces in this genre. According to Christopher Wood, an expert in Victorian art, the details included in Simmons' fairy paintings were \\"executed with an astonishing clarity\\" and gave the impression they had been painted on a glass surface.

He is well known for his discovery (with Toshio Narahashi), that the puffer fish toxin tetrodotoxin causes death by blocking the sodium ion channels that are responsible for nerve activity. Moore was emeritus professor of Neurobiology at Duke University Medical School where he had been a member of the faculty since 1961. Moore's NEURON simulator software, begun with and now carried forward by Michael Hines, is used worldwide. Moore received the Cole Award of the Biophysical Society in 1981. Early life and education Moore was born in November 1920 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where his father was superintendent of the Winston-Salem public schools. He studied physics at Davidson College and entered a graduate program in physics at the University of Virginia in 1941. The day after Pearl Harbor he suddenly discovered he had been working on the project of developing a centrifuge to separate isotopes of uranium for the Manhattan Project. A second war project assignment, making an automated director for ships' guns using radar, awakened his interest in feedback systems that ultimately shaped his professional undertakings. Career =Using the voltage clamp to discover the action of neurotoxins= His first appointment was at RCA where he was heavily influenced by Art Vance, who among other inventions designed the operational amplifier that Moore later introduced into neurophysiology equipment. As his interests began to turn towards applying physics to biological problems, he joined the faculty at the Medical College of Virginia, and then the lab of Kenneth Stewart Cole, at the Naval Medical Research Institute and later the NIH. Moore became one of the earliest adopters of the voltage clamp technique, which Cole had invented and had shown to Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley who had used it to solve the problem of the action potential. Moving to Duke in 1961, Moore improved the voltage clamp, attracting collaborators from different universities and countries who brought him neurotoxins such as tetrodotoxin and red tide toxin to test on nerve axons. Much of this work was carried out on squid giant axons at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, where he spent summers until his death. =Bringing the power of computers into neurobiology= In the 1980s Moore turned his attention to using the evolving power of computers for two big problems: simulating experimental results, and predicting how action potentials travel in neurons of complex geometry. He hired Michael Hines, a mathematician, to collaborate in developing a neuronal simulator they named NEURON. Using NEURON he pioneered the concept of working back and forth between simulations and actual experiments, using simulations to predict the outcome of experiments on biological preparations, and then carrying out the experiment to test the validity of the parameters entered into the simulations. Hines took over the further evolution of NEURON while Moore collaborated with his wife, neurobiologist Ann Stuart, to make the educational tool Neurons in Action based on NEURON. Neurons in Action has been used widely to convey basic principles of neurophysiology, for example by Tibetan monks and nuns of the Dali Llama in exile in Dharamsala, India, and in a course of the International Brain Research Organization held annually for faculty in different African countries. Personal life Moore had two sons and a daughter and seven grandchildren from his first marriage to Natalie Bayless in 1946. In 1978 he married Ann E. Stuart with whom he had one son, Jonathan Stuart-Moore, who has assisted in the development of Neurons in Action. Moore's autobiography is available at the Society for Neuroscience website.

The Twydall Profile was a style of fortification used in British and Imperial polygonal forts at the end of the 19th century. The sloping earthworks employed in the Twydall Profile were intended to be quick and inexpensive to construct and to be effective in the face of the more powerful artillery and high explosive ammunition being introduced at that time. The name comes from the village of Twydall in Kent, where the first forts of this type were built. Origins The design of the Twydall Profile emerged following the Siege of Plevna during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 to 1878. There, the hastily constructed Turkish fieldworks had successfully withstood repeated Russian assaults between July and September 1877; the Russians finally took the town after defeating an attempted Turkish breakout in December. The reason for the effectiveness of the Turkish defences was attributed to two factors; firstly, that the force of the Russian shells had been absorbed by the Turkish earthworks and secondly, that the defenders had been armed with American breech loading and repeating rifles and had been able to break up the attacking infantry formations before they had reached their objectives.Lowry, Bernard (2008) Discovering Fortifications: From the Tudors to the Cold War Shire Books, (pp. 91-92) In the United Kingdom, a huge investment had been made in the previous decades in a considerable number of large fortifications to defend the naval dockyards, collectively known as the Palmerston Forts. Not only had many of these been designed to mount artillery which was now obsolete, but the intended defensive scheme for the dockyard at Chatham in Kent had never been completed. The solution, devised and promoted by the forward thinking military engineer, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir George Sydenham Clarke, was for a smaller, less expensive type of fort or redoubt, which could be manned by infantry and mobile field artillery rather than large guns fixed in deep emplacements. Previous forts had relied on defence against an infantry attack by means of a deep ditch with steep walls, often revetted with stone, brick or concrete, known as the scarp (facing outwards) and the counterscarp (facing inwards). The fort was further protected by caponiers and counterscarp galleries; positions from which rifle or light artillery fire could be directed along the ditch. In the proposed new redoubts, all of this would be replaced by sloping earth banks, intended to maximise the effect of the defenders' rifles and minimise the effect of the attackers' artillery. In 1885, a pair of small forts were accordingly built by way of an experiment, designed to protect the eastern overland approaches to Chatham, near the village of Twydall. Woodlands Redoubt and Grange Redoubt were collectively known as the Twydall Redoubts and were intended to prove the effectiveness of the new system and how quickly and cheaply they could be constructed. Under the direction of Sir Andrew Clarke, the Inspector-General of Fortifications,Dyer, Nick (2003), British Fortification in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, The Palmerston Forts Society, (p. 25) Woodlands Fort was built by a civilian contractor within a month, for the sum of ¬£1,800. Grange Fort was built by the Royal Engineers. Sir Andrew reported that the full cost of the project was \\"...¬£6,000 as opposed to at least ¬£45,000 for the old type [of fort]\\". The redoubts each had a central row of bomb proof casemates in which the infantry garrison could shelter and was surrounded by a low earthen rampart, on which field guns could be sited and a banquette or fire step and parapet, over which the infantry could fire their rifles. The shallow ditch was crossed by a drawbridge at the rear; however, neither work had the barracks, fixed artillery emplacements, magazines or caponiers that might have been expected in a fort of this period. Description In the study of fortification, the term \\"profile\\" means the form of a defensive structure when viewed as a cross section in the vertical plane.Straith, Hector (1851), Introductory Essay to the Study of Fortification, Parker, Furnivall and Parker, London (p.3) The Twydall Profile consists of a simple earthen rampart, built as low as possible; between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 4.5 metres) and not greater than 20 feet (6 metres) was recommended. From the crest of the rampart continuous gentle slope, ideally of a gradient of 1 in 10, falling to 15 or 20 feet (4.5 or 6 metres) below the original surface of the ground. At the foot of the slope is an unclimbable palisade made of angled steel palings, often referred to as a \\"Dacoit fence\\", recommended to be 9 feet 6 inches (2.9 metres) tall. Beyond that, there is a steep earth counterscarp, the main function of which is to protect the palisade from artillery fire. Entanglements of barbed wire may be sited on the forward slope of the rampart and on the crest of the counterscarp. The frontal slope of rampart, known as the \\"superior slope\\", was recommended ideally to be of a gradient of 1 in 10, which had been shown in tests to cause the majority of incoming shells to ricochet on impact.Kenyon, Edward Ranulf (1894) Notes on Land and Coast Fortification, The Royal Engineers Institute, Chatham (pp. 40-41) Examples * Grange Redoubt: Kent, 1885 * Woodland Redoubt: Kent, 1885 * Beacon Hill Battery: Essex, 1889 * Penlee Battery: Cornwall, 1889-1892. * Steynewood Battery: Isle of Wight, 1889-1894 * North Weald Redoubt: Essex, 1890 * Fort Farningham: Surrey, 1890 * Fort Macaulay: Victoria, British Columbia, 1894-1897 * Culver Battery: Isle of Wight, 1904-1906 References Category:Fortification (architectural elements) ","title":"Twydall Profile"},{"id":"44554943","text":"Ancient history is the aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history to the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era.

Truax was a prominent figure in the Chippewa Valley and one of the richest men in the county. His acquisition of wealth was due to the many business ventures he took part in. Truax was one of the leaders of the Prohibitionist movement in the state and was nominated for state and federal office by organizations of that party on several occasions. He owned large stocks in the Bank of Eau Claire and the New Bank of Eau Claire. Truax owned Truax Switch, four miles west of Eau Claire. He was featured in The Horse Review and frequently entered his horses in horse markets. Truax developed one of the largest horse raising industries of the northwest. He was a breeder of thoroughbred horses and it was recorded that he paid $1,000 for a fine mare named Nellie Mason, which he had purchased from New York State. Early life and career Cordella Avery Peter Truax was born in Steuben County, New York in 1828. While he was a boy his parents moved to Allegany County, New York where he later married Cordella Avery on September 23, 1852. Truax and his wife came to Wisconsin in 1853, and settled in Walworth County, Wisconsin. They moved to Eau Claire, Wisconsin in 1855, locating on what later was known as Truax Prairie, where he engaged in farming until 1865 when he moved to town and engaged in general merchandising until 1873. Truax worked in logging and in farming. He also dealt largely in timber lands and invested extensively in real estate. Truax was generally considered one of Eau Claire's millionaires. Truax held a large interest in sawmill property of the Cloquet Lumber Company, and he also held interest in an Electric rail transport system in the State of Idaho. In 1893, Truax purchased the National Electric Company for $7,500. One of the largest buildings in the City of Eau Claire in its early days, Music Hall, was built and owned by Truax. It was replaced by the Kahn-Truax building which was destroyed by a fire in 1871. Truax also owned the Truax Building in Superior, Wisconsin. =Political involvement= Truax mounted a run in 1879 for a seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly.Source: The Blue Book of the State of Wisconsin For 1879, page 491 In a March 4, 1887 Special Election, Truax ran unsuccessfully against Nils P. Haugen to represent Wisconsin's 8th congressional district in the Fiftieth Congress of the United States House of Representatives. In 1898, he ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Wisconsin State Assembly against incumbent Byron Buffington. Death Truax died at 11:20 p.m. on March 18, 1909, at his country residence on Truax Prairie. The cause of death was ulceration of the stomach. Legacy Truax Boulevard is a street on the west side of Eau Claire named for Truax's contributions to the area. Truax's Prairie Home (built in 1864) has been restored and is open for public tours from May through September. Threatened with demolition, the house was moved to the Mill Run Golf Course in the City of Eau Claire in 1984. Originally an L-shaped house, the present two-story structure retains its Greek Revival roof and door architecture. Truax is interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Eau Claire with a large memorial marker.

There are 10 faculties including Antanas Gustaitis Aviation Institute, Architecture, Business Management, Civil Engineering, Creative Industries, Electronics, Environmental Engineering, Fundamental Sciences, Mechanics, Transport Engineering. Scientific research and experimental development is performed by 13 institutes, 3 research centres and 23 research laboratories. The Creativity and Innovation Centre ‚ÄúLinkMen≈≥ fabrikas‚Äù is known as a modern experimentation and innovation hub, providing students with all the tools for practical learning, developing and implementing their ideas. VGTU is among the top 2,1% of the best universities in the world and is the best Baltic university in the subject area of Civil Engineering and Building Construction (QS Top 101-150). VGTU is the best university in Lithuania in the subject areas of Architecture / Built Environment (QS Top 101-150), Business & Management (QS Top 201-250) and Economics & Econometrics (QS Top 301‚Äì350) according to ‚ÄûQS World University Rankings bu Subject‚Äú.  History  VGTU was founded on 1 September 1956, when the Vilnius Evening Division of the Kaunas Polytechnic Institute (now Kaunas University of Technology) was established, with Jeronimas Kudaba as the first dean. In 1960, the division was reorganized into the KPI Vilnius Evening Faculty. Aleksandras ƒåyras was named the Dean of the Faculty, with 500 students. In 1962, the first class of graduates completed their studies. In 1964, the Faculty of Construction Economics was added, followed in 1968 by the Faculty of Urban Construction. In 1969, the division separated from the Kaunas Polytechnic institute and became the Vilnius Civil Engineering Institute (Vilniaus in≈æinerinis statybos institutas), or VISI, and ƒåyras was named the first rector. In 1971, the Faculty of Architecture was added, and in 1987 the Faculty of Municipal Economy was established. After the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990, the Supreme Council of Lithuania decided to change the VISI into the Vilnius Technical University (VTU), with Edmundas Kazimieras Zavadskas as rector. After the statute of VTU was adopted in 1991, the Supreme Council approved it on 2 July 1992. VTU moved more toward a Western European university structure and featured faculties of architecture, construction, engineering communications, mechanics, and electronics. The following year, in 1993, VTU established the Aviation Institute and two more faculties, one in business management and one in fundamental sciences, along with the Faculty of Transport Engineering the following year. On 22 August 1996, the Lithuanian Government awarded the name of Gediminas, a 14th-century Grand Duke of Lithuania, to VTU, and the university became known as Vilnius Gediminas Technical University. Romualdas Gineviƒçius was elected rector by the VGTU Senate in 2002. With the 2009 Law on Higher Education and Research, the Seimas of the Lithuanian Republic ordered all state-funded universities to reorganize into nonprofit organizations (Vie≈°osios ƒØstaigos) tasked with working in the public interest by 2011. VGTU met this requirement in 2011.

Many British hospitals still use paper records. From 1 April 2015 all GP practices in England have to provide online services to patients, including access to summary medical records. Legislation The Access to Medical Reports Act 1988 gave patients the right to see any medical report relating to them \\"which is to be, or has been, supplied by a medical practitioner for employment purposes or insurance purposes\\". The Access to Health Records Act 1990 gave them the right to inspect their own records. The Data Protection Act 1998 and the Data Protection Act 2018 apply to medical records as to other records. Only 3% of GPs in England offered online record access in October 2014 to patients although all of them were expected to by April 2015. EMIS said that the numbers of practices providing patients with online access to their records ‚Äòshot up‚Äô after it allowed GPs to tailor the parts of the record that patients can see. GPs are required from 2015 only to offer patients online access to the medication, allergies and adverse reactions in their summary care record, not to the complete record. Jeremy Hunt announced in September 2015 that all patients will be entitled to read and write to all their NHS health records online by 2018. Development Failures to link up medical records held by hospitals and those kept by their family doctors put patient's lives at risk, according to Prof Steve Field of the Care Quality Commission. He says this could be tackled by giving patients access to their own records ‚Äì a system pioneered, in an attempt to restore patient confidence, by Dr Amir Hannan. Hannan faced a difficult problem when he took over the GP practice formerly held by Dr Harold Shipman, who had murdered several hundred patients. ‚ÄúIt was very difficult to recruit to Shipman‚Äôs practice because of [the lack of] trust locally. But Amir said, ‚ÄòRight from the start I will share everything with my patients, and gave them access to all their own records.\\" \\"He's got examples of patients being admitted to hospital where they have had to show the consultants their record which may have saved their lives. It's policy to try and make it happen. But it's not moving quickly enough.‚Äù 150 patients at the practice were given access to their medical records and test results over the internet in 2007 using a system run by Emis. They could go online to order prescriptions, communicate with their GP or even to print off their medical records to take to appointments with hospital consultants. As of October 2014 the practice had enabled over 3,200 patients - 28% of its total patient population - to have electronic access to their GP record. This level of access has been shown to cut down on appointments by as much as 12% and the number of phone calls made to practices. Ingrid Brindle, a patient at Hannan's practice, has had online access to her record for over eight years. She said having access to her record was ‚Äòinvaluable‚Äô and allowed her and her GP to work together as a ‚Äòteam‚Äô. ‚ÄòThe amount of time I don't have to contact the practice is incredible,‚Äô she told GPs at a King‚Äôs Fund event. ‚ÄòI really don't understand why so little progress has been made. Empowering patients and giving them control over their situation so that they understand when they're making their health choices, to me it's a no-brainer.‚Äô The NHS England National Information Board produced a document Personalised Health and Care 2020, in November 2014 outlining plans for patients to be able to add comments into their care records from March 2018 and for NHS regulators to take action against trusts failing to hit new technology targets. It was enthusiastically supported by Lord Darzi who argued that interested patients and carers, especially those accustomed to self-management of their condition, should take the lead in creating apps and other means of accessing records that are customised to the needs of patient groups. Progress has been slow and patchy. Hannan says \\"If we set a target like 2018 for things to happen, then it will be 2025 before they do.‚Äù Professor Chris Ham says: ‚ÄúOn the one hand there is a great deal of innovation out there, but we are too dependent on the work of Dr Hannan and others. There is also too much variation, something great can be going on in one area but it can be a completely different story just down the road.‚Äù Care.data Dr Hannan has dealt with the Care.data controversy by placing detailed information and an opt-out form of the practice website about the care.data scheme linked to various information sources including the practice‚Äôs understanding, not just the official information provided by NHS England. The practice has had 372 patients opt out using this tool in one week. Community Services Both patients and staff of Locala Community Partnerships can use Microsoft Lync. This can be used to offer the patient a virtual assessment. Patients can access Lync through an emailed hyperlink and a clinician can then assess the symptom via video call, reducing the time taken out of the patient‚Äôs day. Hospital records A system developed for renal patients, Renal patient view, provides online information for kidney patients‚Äô including diagnoses, treatment and latest test results. Almost all renal units in the UK can use this system, and it has been extended to patients with inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes in Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. The Scottish Government is funding a pilot for patients with heart failure. Opt-out A system for patients to opt out of sharing their personal health data beyond direct care was launched by NHS Digital in 2018 as a response to the care.data fiasco, but by 1 October, only 2,185 people had used it. MedConfidential complained that there had been little publicity for this scheme. Scotland As part of the Scottish Government's 2020 Vision for Health and Social Care, all patients will be given online access to their own health records by 2020.

While a college student, he was elected to the Zephyrhills City Council in 2005, defeating Celia Graham with 60% of the vote. Burgess was re-elected in 2007, defeating Richard Kaeberlein with 82% of the vote, and he served as President of the City Council. In 2008, after he graduated with a degree in political science, he resigned from the City Council to attend the Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law in Orlando, graduating with his Juris Doctor in 2011. Upon graduation, he was commissioned in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the U.S. Army Reserve as a first lieutenant and continues to serve in the rank of captain.

R.; Baire, B.; Niu, D.; Willoughby, P. H.; Woods, B. P. Nature, 2012, 490, 208 Holden, C.; Greaney, M. F. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 2014, 53, 5746 Yeoman, J. T. S.; Reisman, S. E. Nature, 2012, 490, 179 This benzyne intermediate then reacts with a suitable trapping agent to form a substituted aromatic product. This reaction is a derivative of the established Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction and proceeds via a similar [4+2] cycloaddition mechanism. The HDDA reaction is particularly effective for forming heavily functionalized aromatic systems and multiple ring systems in one synthetic step. HDDA Figure - Generalized(2)  Reaction mechanism  Depending on the substrate chosen, the HDDA reaction can be initiated thermally or by the addition of a suitable catalyst, often a transition metal.Yun, S. Y.; Wang, K.-P.; Lee, N.-K.; Mamidipalli, P.; Lee, D. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2013, 135, 4668 Vandavasi, J. K.; Hu, W.-P.; Hsiao, C.-T.; Senadi, G. C.; Wang, J.-J. RSC Adv., 2014, 4, 57547 The prevailing mechanism for the thermally-initiated HDDA reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a conjugated diyne (1,3-dialkyne) and an alkyne (often referred to as a diynophile in analogy to the Diels‚ÄìAlder dienophile) to form an ortho-benzyne species. The metal-catalyzed HDDA is thought to proceed through a similar pathway, forming a metal-stabilized benzyne, which is then trapped. The simplest model of an HDDA reaction is the cycloaddition of butadiyne and acetylene to form ortho-benzyne (o-benzyne, shown below).Ajaz, A.; Bradley, A. Z.; Burrell, R. C.; Li, W. H. H.; Daoust, K. J.; Bovee, L. B.; DiRico, K. J.; Johnson, R. P. J. Org. Chem., 2011, 76, 9320 This reactive intermediate (denoted by brackets) subsequently reacts with a generalized trapping reagent that consists of a nucleophilic (Nu-) and electrophilic (El-) site, giving the benzenoid product shown. HDDA Figure 1 - Simple The o-benzyne intermediate can be visualized in the two resonance (chemistry) forms illustrated above. The most commonly depicted form is the alkyne (1), but the cumulene (1‚Äô) form can be helpful in visualizing ring formation by [4+2] cycloaddition. = Thermodynamics and kinetics = The HDDA reaction is often thermodynamically favorable (exothermic), but can have a significant kinetic barrier to reaction (high activation energy). Calculations have suggested that the formation of unsubstituted o-benzyne (from butadiyne and acetylene, above) has an activation energy of 36 kcal mol‚àí1, but is thermodynamically favorable, estimated to be exothermic by -51 kcal mol‚àí1. As a result of higher activation energy, some HDDA reactions require heating to elevated temperatures (>100 ‚Å∞C) in order to initiate. Furthermore, the benzyne trapping step is also thermodynamically favourable, calculated to be an additional -73 kcal mol‚àí1 for trapping of an ester-substituted o-benzyne with tert-butanol. HDDA Figure - Thermo The HDDA [4+2] cycloaddition can occur via either a concerted pathway or a stepwise reaction, diradical pathway. These two pathways can differ in activation energy depending on substrate and reaction system. Computational studies have suggested that while both pathways are comparable in activation energy for unactivated (unsubstituted) diynophiles, the stepwise pathway has a lower activation energy barrier, and so is the dominant pathway, for activated diynophiles.Liang, Y.; Hong, X.; Yu, P.; Houk, K. N. Org. Lett., 2014, 16, 5702 = Regiochemistry = The regiochemistry of non-symmetrical HDDA- derived benzyne trapping can be explained by a combination of electronic and ring distortion effects. Computationally, the more obtuse angle (a) corresponds to the more electron deficient (Œ¥+) benzyne carbon, leading to attack of the nucleophilic component at this site. Consequently, the electrophilic component adds at the more electron rich (Œ¥-) site (b). HDDA figure - bond angles = Terminology = The HDDA reaction is a derivative of, and mechanistically related to, the classical Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. As described by Hoye and coworkers, the HDDA reaction can be viewed conceptually as a member of a series of pericyclic reactions with increasing unsaturation (by incremental removal of hydrogen pairs). The ‚Äúhexadehydro‚Äù descriptor is derived from this interpretation, as the simplest HDDA reaction product (o-benzyne, 4 hydrogens) has 6 fewer hydrogen atoms than the simplest Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction product (cyclohexene, 10 hydrogens). HDDA Figure 2 - DA- DHDA-THDA-HDDA comparison Formally, the hexadehydro Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction describes only the formation of the benzyne, but this species is an unstable intermediate that reacts readily with a variety of trapping partners, including reaction solvents. Thus, in practice the HDDA reaction describes a two-step cascade reaction of benzyne formation and trapping to yield the final product.  Historical development  The first examples of the HDDA reaction were reported independently in 1997 by the groups of Ueda and Johnson.Bradley, A. Z.; Johnson, R. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1997, 119, 9917 Cahill, K. J.; Ajaz, A.; Johnson, R. P. Aust. J. Chem., 2010, 63, 1007 Miyawaki, K.; Suzuki, R.; Kawano, T.; Ueda, I. Tetrahedron Lett., 1997, 38, 3943 Johnson and co-workers observed the cyclization of 1,3,8-nonatriyne under flash vacuum thermolysis (600 ¬∞C, 10‚àí2 torr) to form two products, indane and the dehydrogenation product indene, in 95% combined yield. Deuterium labeling studies suggested that the product was formed by a [4+2] cycloaddition to a benzyne intermediate, followed by in-situ reduction to form the observed products. Ueda and co-workers observed that acyclic tetraynes cyclized at room temperature to form 5H-fluorenol derivatives. The formation of a benzyne intermediate was determined by trapping studies, using benzene or anthracene to trap the benzyne as a Diels‚ÄìAlder adduct. Ueda and co-workers further elaborated on this method in subsequent reports, trapping the benzyne using a variety of nucleophiles (oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-based), as well as synthesizing larger, fused-ring aromatic systems.Ueda, I.; Sakurai, Y.; Kawano, T.; Wada, Y.; Futai, M. Tetrahedron Lett., 1999, 40, 319 Miyawaki, K.; Kawano, T.; Ueda, I. Tetrahedron Lett., 2000, 41, 1447 K. Miyawaki, F. Ueno, I. Ueda, Heterocycles, 2001, 54, 887 Torikai, K.; Otsuka, Y.; Nishimura, M.; Sumida, M.; Kawai, T.; Sekiguchi, K.; Ueda, I. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2008, 16, 5441 Kimura, H.; Torikai, K.; Miyawaki, K.; Ueda, I. Chem. Lett., 2008, 37, 662 While known for over a decade, the HDDA reaction did not come into wider synthetic use until 2012, when Hoye and co-workers conducted a thorough investigation into the scope and utility of this cycloaddition. That paper referred to this diyne‚Äìdiynophile reaction as the‚Äúhexadehydro Diels‚ÄìAlder (HDDA) reaction, and this terminology has since come into more widespread use. Since 2012, the HDDA reaction has been an area of renewed interest and has attracted further study by a number of research groups.Karmakar, R.; Mamidipalli, P.; Yun, S. Y.; Lee, D. Org. Lett., 2013, 15, 1938  Reaction scope  One of the main advantages of the HDDA reaction over other methods of accessing benzynes is the simplicity of the reaction system. HDDA reaction of triynes or tetraynes forms benzynes without the direct formation of by- products. In comparison, the formation of benzyne through removal of ortho- substituents on arenes results in stoichiometric amounts of byproducts from those substituents. For example, formation of benzyne from 1 mole of 2-trimethylsilylphenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate) produces 1 mole of trimethylsilyl fluoride and 1 mole of triflate ion. Byproducts can compete with other reagents for benzyne trapping, cause side-reactions, and may require additional purification. Additionally, the HDDA reaction can be useful for substrates with sensitive functionality that might not be tolerated by other benzyne formation conditions (e.g. strong base). The thermally-initiated HDDA reaction has been shown to tolerate esters, ketones, protected amides, ethers, protected amines, aryl halides, alkyl halides, alkenes, and cyclopropanes. = Green chemistry = The HDDA reaction can fulfill several principles of green chemistry. * Atom Economy ‚Äì All of the atoms in the HDDA substrate remain in the product after the reaction and atoms of the trapping reagent are incorporated into the product. * Reduced Waste ‚Äì Formation of the benzyne species produces no stoichiometric byproducts. Products are often formed in high yield with few side-products. * Catalysis ‚Äì HDDA reaction occurs thermally or with a sub-stoichiometric amount of catalyst.  Synthetic applications  = Intramolecular trapping = The HDDA reaction can be used to synthesize multi-cyclic ring systems from linear precursors containing the diyne, diynophile, and the trapping group. For example, Hoye and co-workers were able to synthesize fused, tricyclic ring systems from linear triyne precursors in one step and high yields via a thermally-initiated, intramolecular HDDA reaction. Furthermore, both nitrogen- and oxygen- containing heterocycles could be incorporated by use of an appropriate precursor. In this case, the pendant ilyl ether provided the trapping group, through a retro-Brook rearrangement. HDDA Figure 3 - Heterocycle = Intermolecular trapping = HDDA-generated benzynes can also be trapped intermolecularly by a variety of trapping reagents. Careful choice of trapping reagent can add further functionality, including aryl halides, aryl heteroatoms (phenols and aniline derivatives), and multiple ring systems.Niu, D.; Wang, T.; Woods, B. P.; Hoye, T. R. Org. Lett., 2014, 16, 254 HDDA Figure - Intermolecular Trapping = Ene reactions = The HDDA reaction can be used in a cascade reaction sequence with ene reactions, such as the Alder ene reaction and the aromatic ene reaction.Niu, D.; Hoye, T. R. Nat. Chem., 2014, 6, 34 The HDDA-generated benzyne can be trapped with a suitable ene donor that is covalently tethered to the benzyne. The benzyne serves as the enophile, while the ene can be an alkene (Alder ene) or an aromatic ring (aromatic ene). Lee and co-workers have shown an HDDA-Alder ene cascade reaction that can produce a variety of products, including medium-sized fused rings, spirocycles, and allenes. HDDA Figure - alder-ene Hoye and co-workers demonstrated a thermally-initiated triple HDDA-aromatic ene-Alder ene cascade that leads to heavily functionalized products in one-step with no additional reagents or by-products. HDDA Figure - aromatic ene = Dehydrogenation = HDDA-derived benzynes have also been shown to dehydrogenate saturated alkanes to form alkenes.Niu, D.; Willoughby, P. H.; Woods, B. P.; Baire, B.; Hoye, T. R. Nature, 2013, 501, 531 In the absence of external trapping reagents, the benzyne intermediate can abstract vicinal (chemistry) hydrogen atoms from a suitable donor, often the reaction solvent (such as tetrahydrofuran or cyclooctane). This desaturates the donor alkane, forming an alkene, and traps the benzyne to a dihydrobenzenoid product. Isotopic labelling and computational studies suggest that the double hydrogen transfer mechanism occurs by a concerted pathway and that the rate of reaction is highly dependent on the conformation of the alkane donor. This reaction can be used to access 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted aromatic rings, a substitution pattern that can be difficult to access through other synthetic methodology. HDDA Figure - Dehydrogenation = C-H activation = The HDDA reaction can also be used as a method of C-H activation, where a pendant alkane C-H bond traps a metal- complexed aryne intermediate. Lee and co-workers observed that transition metal catalysts induced an HDDA reaction of tetraynes that was intramolecularly trapped by a pendant, sp3 C-H bond. Primary, secondary, and tertiary C-H bonds were all reactive trapping partners, with silver salts being the most effective catalysts. Deuterium labelling experiments suggest that the (sp3) C-H bond breaking and (sp2) C-H bond forming reactions occur in a concerted fashion. HDDA Figure - C-H activation = Fluorination = The silver-catalyzed HDDA reaction has also been used to synthesize organofluorine compounds by use of a fluorine-containing counterion.Wang, K.-P.; Yun, S. Y.; Mamidipalli, P.; Lee, D. Chem. Sci., 2013, 4, 3205 The metal-complexed aryne intermediate can be trapped by the counterion to produce aryl rings with fluoro, trifluoromethyl, or trifluoromethylthiol substituents. Unstable counterions, such as CF3‚àí, can be produced in-situ. HDDA Figure - fluorination = The domino HDDA reaction= Properly designed polyyne substrate has been shown to undergo efficient cascade net [4+2] cycloadditions merely upon being heated. This domino hexadehydro Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction is initiated by a rate- limiting benzyne formation. Proceeding through naphthyne, anthracyne, and/or tetracyne intermediates, rapid bottom-up synthesis of highly fused, polycyclic aromatic compounds results. 712x712px = The aza HDDA reaction= Nitriles can also participate in the HDDA reactions to generate pyridyne intermediates. In situ capturing of pyridynes gives rise to highly substituted and functionalized pyridine derivatives, which is complementary to other classical approaches for construction of this important class of heterocycles. 450x450px  References  Category:Cycloadditions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Hexadehydro Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction"},{"id":"44555398","text":"Any Old Iron may refer to: * Any Old Iron (novel), a 1989 historical novel by Anthony Burgess * \\"Any Old Iron\\" (song), a British music hall song ","title":"Any Old Iron"},{"id":"44555401","text":"J√∏rgen Arboe-Rasmussen (5 March 1925 ‚Äì 5 or 6 February 1945) was a member of the Danish resistance killed by the German occupying power.

Whilst Mass would have been said first at Leather Mill Farm, Caldecote, then at a cottage in Bond Street, a permanent church was required for the burgeoning Catholic population. In 1837, a parcel of land was purchased in Coton Road, where the new church was to be built. St. Mary's was opened in 1838 (a year after the foundation stone was laid.https://www.ourladyoftheangelsnuneaton.com/history The laity was first served by the Dominicans (until 1880) and then the Capuchin Fathers (until 1889). =Our Lady of the Angels= 1889 was another key moment in the history of the parish. After nine years, the Capuchin Fathers moved to Olton Friary, Solihull. At this point, the church came fully under the control of the then Diocese of Birmingham (it was not elevated to an Archdiocese until 1911) and the diocesan clergy. Concurrently, the name of the church was changed to Our Lady of the Angels. =Parish Changes= In 1949, the geographical size of the parish was altered, when St. Anne's Parish church was built, as a result of the growing Catholic population in the town. 1960, a new \\"Mass centre\\", St. Bernadette's was built in Stockingford (again to address the growing Catholic population in Nuneaton).

He was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Roosevelt was diagnosed with \\"infantile paralysis\\" (paralytic polio) at the time, but his symptoms are more consistent with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, which his doctors failed to consider as a diagnostic possibility.

History Barrow Stores was originally started by Richard Cadbury, of the Cadbury chocolate family. Richard opened a small drapery store in 1794 in Bull Street. By 1824 the Cadbury family opened a new shop next door selling tea, coffee and cocoa. However, in 1849 John Cadbury transferred the business to his cousin Richard Cadbury Barrow so they could concentrate on the manufacture of chocolate. The business was renamed Barrow Stores. By 1905 the store had been rebuilt with a new cafe on the first floor for the customers to try the companies products, and had numerous departments from glass & china to food. The business use to provide Christmas lists with lists of good available for customers to purchase, while their fleet of vehicles use to deliver goods across Birmingham and to areas such as Wolverhampton & Lichfield. In the 1960s Barrow Stores moved from their location on the corner of Bull Street and Corporation Street to a smaller store on Corporation Street opposite Lewis', where the new store concentrated on food. The business was purchased by Fitch Lovell in 1964, and in December 1973 merged Barrow Stores into its supermarket chain Key Markets. His fascination for Barrow Stores led J.R.R.

This includes fruits such as Peaches, Guavas, and the all-famous Palai Orange amongst many other citrus fruits. The significance of the above mentioned issue is not just due to quality, it has to do with quantity as well. The area is home to approximately 171,000 fruit-bearing trees; playing a vital role in the purification of the air and acting as a habitat to countless species of both flora and fauna. Besides that, the orchards of the area attract tens of thousands of bees during the flowering season every year, serving as a homestead to the honey-making business. In the past few years, the area has observed an exponential increase in the number of trees and orchards, because of the government's arrangement of the water-canal. The construction of Swat Expressway (especially Palai Interchange) is supposed to take the area's Agriculture and Apiculture industries to a whole new level because, for the first time in history, the producers will get an opportunity to showcase their products in bigger markets; both nationally and internationally.

Early life and introduction to weaving Abbott was born in Auckland in 1922. Growing up in Depression-era New Zealand, Abbott left school at the age of thirteen to become a dressmaker, and was subsequently drafted into essential work during World War Two. During the 1950s, she travelled around New Zealand, living in a caravan and working as a sewing machine instructor. Abbott first studied weaving with German-born weaver Ilse von Randow at the Auckland City Art Gallery in 1952. Abbott acquired her own loom and began experimenting with unspun wool and natural dyes and fibres. Career as a weaver In 1959, her work was shown in the Auckland City Art Gallery in An Exhibition of New Zealand Craft Work, alongside artists such as Doreen Blumhardt, Barry Brickell, Len Castle, Helen Mason, Patricia Charlotte Perrin and Mirek Sm√≠≈°ek. In her work Abbott used natural and artificial dyes, and materials ranging from art silk and flax fibre to alkathene piping and burglar alarm tape. From the late 1950s Abbott became interested in 'extending the traditional boundaries of weaving into three-dimensional constructions'. In 1986 her work was featured in Elizabeth Eastmond and Merimeri Penfold's book Women and the arts in New Zealand - Forty Works: 1936-86: the work the authors chose to reproduce was Scrolls (1980), a large sculptural piece made up of a triptych of wall hangings and two large woven scrolls placed on the floor, which viewers were encouraged to unroll to reveal the woven text 'From thorny plants the hidden fibre', which referenced the sisal derived from cactus plants which was one of her favourite materials. In 1958 Abbott opened a professional handweaving studio in Blockhouse Bay, Auckland. From the studio she ran a small-scale commercial operation, teaching and employing several women and selling her work through craft shops and galleries throughout New Zealand. Abbott exported her work to Australia, and exhibited in Australia, England, Canada and the United States. In 1968, Abbott was one of the founding members of Brown's Mill Market, New Zealand‚Äôs first craft co-operative, located in an old flour mill in Durham Lane, Auckland. Ian Spalding wrote: > By her work with the Handweavers Guild and the New Zealand chapter of the > World Crafts Council, by her generous sharing of techniques and by her > continuing help and encouragement Zena Abbott has been an inspiration to > hundreds of weavers and has made an inestimable contribution to the > development of the craft in N.Z.

Most of its remaining buildings were demolished in 1955.Lowestoft Porcelain Factory, kilns etc., Heritage Gateway. Retrieved 2011-05-05 Lowestoft collectors divide the factory's products into three distinct periods, Early Lowestoft c. 1756-c. 1761, Middle-Period c. 1761-c. 1768 and Late-Period c. 1768 to factory closure in 1802.Today ‚Äì a phoenix from the ashes!, Lowestoft Porcelain index. Retrieved 2011-04-21. All told, the factory was in production for longer than any English soft-paste porcelain producer other than Royal Worcester and Royal Crown Derby. Geographically, it was isolated from other porcelain factories, or indeed makers of fine earthenware, which probably accounts for a relatively slow- moving stylistic development. It was also relatively small, with a maximum workforce of about 70. Nonetheless, it survived longer than the average English factory, perhaps because it had less competition in the local market.Battie, 133-134; Honey, 208; Godden, 130 The factory produced experimental wares in about 1756 and first advertised their porcelain in 1760. Although Lowestoft probably sold mainly to the local East Anglian market, by 1770 it had a warehouse, effectively a shop, in Cheapside, London.Honey, 199; Advertisement of March 17th, 1770: \\"Clark Durnford, Lowestoft China Warehouse, No 4 Great St. St Thomas the Apostle, Queen St, Cheapside, London, where merchants and shopkeepers may be supplied with any quantity of the said ware at the usual prices. NB - Allowance of Twenty per cent for Ready Money. Robert Browne & Co, China Manufactory, Lowestoft, Suffolk\\" Teapot, c. 1770 During the early period wares decorated with Chinese-inspired scenes in underglaze blue were produced. This type of decoration continued to form the majority of production throughout the life of the factory but scenes were gradually simplified. Overglaze colours in enamel were used from about 1768, generally in white and blue or in a polychrome that utilizes a bright brick red.Lowestoft , Eastern Daily Press, 2010-04-14. Retrieved 2011-05-11. After 1770 transfer printing was used. Some figures were made, mostly in the 1780s, of musicians, putti, and animals, but these are all rare.Battie, 133; Godden, 125; Honey, 208-210 The Lowestoft body paste contained bone ash, and is similar to that of Bow; probably a former worker at Bow was employed when the factory began. Occasionally there can be difficulties telling the two apart, usually with blue and white pieces.Honey, 199 The quality of the porcelain is not the highest, especially after 1770, but even the less polished pieces have \\"the appealling simplicity of folk art\\",Battie, 134 and the high proportion of commemorative pieces, inscribed for people, places or occasions, add to their interest.Honey, 208 Many such documentary pieces are dated which, together with the wasters excavated at the site in 1902 and 1967, has helped to build up a good picture of the factory's products.Honey, 200 Common types \\"Hughes-type\\" tea caddy, chinoiserie decoration, c. 1760 Many pieces are in a pattern, itself derived from Chinese models, known as \\"Redgrave\\" (after a family with several workers at the factory), with paeonies and rocks.Honey, 204, 206; Godden, 121, 125 This exists in several types, some with their own names such as \\"House pattern\\" and \\"Two-Bird pattern\\". Most combined underglaze blue with overglaze enamel decoration, as Chinese porcelain sometimes does.Godden, 125, 127 Another group is called \\"Hughes-type\\", after James Hughes, a modeller. Most of the surface has moulded low relief with small and rather vague plant shapes, leaves and garlands. Areas left with a flat surface are painted in underglaze blue in a Chinese style, typically a circular or oval space in the centre of the sides, where landscape scenes are painted, and borders at top and perhaps bottom, painted with floral or geometric motifs. These are mostly dated to the first decade or so of the factory.Godden, 125 The outstanding painter of the factory, active in the 1770s, is known only as the \\"Tulip Painter\\". His distinctive pieces feature \\"bold, powerfully painted flower sprays, featuring prominently a large tulip\\".Godden, 125 Lowestoft has a higher proportion than most factories of \\"documentary\\" pieces bearing dates, names of owners, or other inscriptions, for \\"farmers' celebrations, elections, weddings, and the like\\".Honey, 208 More than 200 dated pieces are known.Battie, 133 There is a class of \\"birthday plaques\\", with a name and date.Honey, 208 The words A Trifle from Lowestoft (or other places in East Anglia), are painted on small items. These evidently functioned as souvenirs in these early days of tourism in England. Lowestoft was becoming a seaside resort, and two visitors have left accounts showing that the well-off were encouraged to see over the factory and buy. In 1772 a doctor on a day trip from Yarmouth with friends put in his diary: \\"After dinner visited the china manufactory carried on there. Most of it is rather ordinary. The Painting branch is done by women...\\".Godden, 123. This is Dr Silas Neville. In 1777 a Thomas Wale and friends \\"saw the china ware fabrick, etc, and all of us bought some of it. Saw ye hanging gardens, and ye fine prospect of ye sea. Excellent bathing-machines, etc. ....\\".Godden, 123 So-called \\"Oriental Lowestoft\\" Souvenir inkstand, c. 1780, \\"A Trifle from Lowestoft\\" A persistent \\"notorious mistake\\" in several editions of a standard book by the Victorian expert William Chaffers allocated to Lowestoft types of Chinese export porcelain that had been produced in large quantities (far more than the small Lowestoft factory could have made). There were in fact some Chinese imitations (in hard- paste porcelain) of Lowestoft porcelain shipped out to China by the British East India Company.Honey, 198; Godden, 121, 125 It is also possible that some Chinese \\"blanks\\" were given overglaze decoration in Lowestoft. A Robert Allen, first a painter at the factory and later the manager from c. 1780, also had his own workshop in the town where he decorated pieces \\"in the white\\" from elsewhere.Honey, 199 The Chinese pieces may still be called \\"Chinese Lowestoft\\",Godden, 121 or \\"Oriental Lowestoft\\" in the United States. Business history The start of the factory is somewhat unclear. Robert Browne (d. 1771) was the manager, with other partners, of which Philip Walker (d. 1803) was the most senior. Walker seems to have had (by 1760) kilns making tiles and earthenware, and Browne may have been a chemist. Two other partners, Obed Aldred and John Richman (d. 1771) were probably \\"non-executives\\", who provided capital. Apprentices were being taken on by June 1760, indentured to Browne.Godden, 122 By 1770 the company name was \\"Robert Browne and Company\\".Honey, 199 When Robert Browne died in 1771 he was succeeded as manager by his son of the same name, who introduced, or increased the amount of, polychrome overglaze enamelling.Godden, 125 Although traditional sources date the end of the factory to 1802 or 1803, Geoffrey Godden concluded that the factory had ceased production by 1800, after some key employees are recorded working at Worcester porcelain. He believed production had been running down from about 1795, as competition from Staffordshire pottery, both in fine earthenware and bone china, grew. A letter from the son of the younger Robert Browne, recalling his father's view, explains the closure: \\"they could not produce the wares so cheaply as the Staffordshire potters, and that they were getting old and wished to retire from the business, not from want of capital, as they were all wealthy men for the period...\\".Godden, 128-130 Marks and collections Lowestoft has no factory mark of its own, though the inscribed documentary pieces and \\"trifles\\" can be useful for identification. Some pieces used the marks of Meissen or Worcester; the excavation of \\"wasters\\" at the kiln site with these has put the matter beyond doubt.Honey, 199-203, 208 At present, Lowestoft porcelain collections are displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London,V&A;, 385 images online the museum in Nicholas Everett Park, Oulton Broad, at the Castle Museum, Norwich, and at the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.Collections Explorer, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.

In the winter of 1905, he worked at K√°roly Ferenczy's private school. The following year, he made a brief study tour through Paris, Vienna and Munich.Samu B√∂rts√∂k @ K√©pz≈ëm≈±v√©szet Magyarorsz√°gon (Fine Arts in Hungary) Two years later, he held his first exhibition. In 1908, he returned to Nagyb√°nya, established himself there, and was among the first to open a permanent studio, although he continued to paint plein-air as the other artists did. Three years later, he became the Vice-President and Executive Chairman of the Nagyb√°nya Painter's Society. In 1912, he and R√©ti created the first Nagyb√°nya exhibition catalog. Ten years later, at R√©ti's request, he compiled a biographical directory of the colony's artists. He then became a teacher at the local art school in 1925. Shortly after, however, he began to be seriously ill. As a young man, when he was briefly a member of the Hussars, he had been thrown from his horse, which then stepped on his stomach. He had suffered from bouts of illness ever since, but they now worsened significantly. In 1930, he moved his family to Budapest, seeking improved treatment, but died in 1931; apparently from lung failure. His widow had to sell his paintings to pay off their debts.

Howel-Gwyn-AS Statue of Gwyn, Victoria Gardens, Neath,1889, by Mario Raggi Early life Gwyn was the son of William Gwyn and Mary Anne Roberts. His mother was the daughter of John Roberts of Barnstaple, Devon. He was educated privately at Neath and at Swansea Grammar School. Public life Gwyn participated in the public life of several Welsh counties. He was High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1837, of Carmarthenshire in 1838 and of Breconshire in 1844. Gwyn successfully contested Penryn and Falmouth at the 1847 General Election and continued to represent the borough until 1857. He represented Brecon from 1866 until 1869 when he was unseated by petition. Having been returned for Brecon in 1868 it was generally accepted that his supporters had been caught engaged in bribery. The following year, a petition was brought forward to unseat him due to allegations of bribery and illegal activities. Gwyn was largely exonerated personally but the charges were upheld and his election annulled in April 1869. In 1874 he unsuccessfully contested the Brecknock constituency against W Fuller Maitland. Later life and death Gwyn played a prominent role in the public life of the Borough of Neath and contributed land towards the building of a hall, known as the Gwyn Hall. He died at his home in 1888. The radical Welsh language newspaper, Tarian y Gweithiwr, recalled him as an old-fashioned Conservative who was a staunch defender of the Church of England.

Newspaper weekly  The Free Press was a Democratic weekly paper owned by the Scripps brothers and it was notable in its era for humor, low cost, and reliance on advertising revenue The two-cent price point of the paper (significantly lower than other publications) allowed for widespread distribution to working class audiences. This business model relied on high circulation as a selling point for advertising. The Detroit Free Press first published the Brother Gardner's Lime Kiln Club in 1878. Author Charles Bertrand Lewis, a Union veteran and staff writer since 1869, was a popular humorist for the paper, wrote under the pen name \\"M. Quad\\". Lewis's Lime Kiln Club was a fictional, African-American, fraternal organization featuring negative stereotypes of blacks in an appeal to working-class Democrats during a racially charged era. Lewis wrote his pieces in African-American dialect and spoken by characters with names like Brother Gardner, Waydown Bebee, and Elder Toots. Each Lime Kiln Club episode follows a club debate on issues of politics, economics, and philosophy. The absurdity and ignorance of these discussions served to satirize both African- Americans and politicians. The column proved hugely popular and it was syndicated nationally and published as a book, Brother Gardner's Lime-Kiln Club: being the regular proceedings of the regular club for the last three years ; with some philosophy, considerable music, a few lectures, and a heap of advice wirth reading,' in 1887. Charles Lewis ceased writing Lime Kiln Club stories when he left The Detroit Free Press for a higher salary at New York World in 1891.  Adaptations  = Vaudeville = The original Detroit Free Press' column was also adapted for vaudeville performance. Evidence in the form of advertisements and a review from Variety magazine in 1909 reveal that the 25 minute performance was well received in New York.Rush. \\"\\"The Lime Kiln Club\\"\\" Rev. of The Lime Kiln Club. Variety July 1909: 14. Internet Archive. Web. 29 Oct. 2014. . The magazine also reveals that the show was put on by George Walker and Bert Williams troupe. This duo achieved fame for their performances in black face under the name \\"Two Real Coons\\", a title chosen to distinguish themselves from minstrelry performances by white actors in black face. Their performance of the Lime Kiln Club also featured famed black actors Abbie Mitchell and Tom Fletcher.  Bert William's Lime Kiln Field Day  In 1913, Biograph Studios began production on an untitled film adaption of The Lime Kiln Club directed by Edwin Middleton and T. Hayes Hunter. William's Lime Kiln Field Day proceeded D.W. Griffiths epic The Birth Of A Nation by two years. It stands in contrast to Griffith's film as one of the only surviving silent films with an all black cast. The film followed a day of romance between stars Bert Williams and Odessa Warren Grey. The film was cancelled early for unknown reasons, and in 1938 Biograph donated the negatives to the Museum of Modern Art. In 2014, museum staff reassembled the seven reels of raw footage in order to screen the film publicly for the first time. The negative footage of Bert William's Lime Kiln Field Day screening is notably accompanied by video footage and still images of interaction between the film's black cast and white production crew.

It sits about 2 kilometers southeast of S√∂dra Sandby village in Sandby parish in southeastern √ñland. It is also close to the village of G√•rdby. From 2011 the fort has been subject of excavation, the results of which show that it was the scene of a massacre in the late 5th century AD. The victims of the massacre were never buried but are found lying as they fell, inside the houses and scattered on the streets of the fort. This has resulted in a unique snapshot character of the archaeology at Sandby borg, providing new insights both to violence and conflict in the Iron Age but also concerning everyday life in the ringfort. Location and size The ringfort of Sandby borg is located adjacent to the shoreline on south-east √ñland. Today, the structure consists of an eroded oval stone wall of 2-3 m height enclosing an area of approximately 5000 m2. The walls are made from local limestone with a fill of erratic boulders and pebbles. Three gates are visible as shallow depressions in the wall; crop marks visible in aerial shots of the site suggest the presence of a possible fourth gate. The original ringfort wall was 4 m wide and would have been approximately 4‚Äì5 m high. Aerial photographs and geophysical surveys of the ringfort interior revealed buried stone structures, interpreted as stone house walls of 53 houses. The layout is similar to that of several other √ñland ringforts, e.g. Eketorp, with houses radially placed inside the ring wall and a central block surrounded by a streetStenberger, M. 1933. √ñland under √§ldre j√§rn√•ldern. Diss. Uppsala Univ.; Borg et al. 1976. To the west of the ringfort there is a structure consisting of numerous regularly placed rows of large erratic boulders, probably part of the defensive structure of the fort (see image). Sandby borg ringfort seen from the west. Note the structure of erratic boulders that surrounds the western perimeter of the fort. Photo by Sebastian Jakobsson. Archaeological excavation Suspected looting pits were discovered during initial geophysical work by Andreas Viberg in spring 2010. This led the local antiquarian authorities to commission a metal detector survey of the whole site carried out in August 2010. Here, five deposits of exquisite Migration Period jewelry were discovered hidden in different houses within the central block of the fort. Each deposit contained a gilded silver relief brooch along with various items, such as glass beads, finger rings and silver pendants. The relief brooches are large, prestigious items of a very high quality, typically made of gilded silver and covered with decorative animal art designs. The brooches, which were probably part of aristocratic women‚Äôs jewelry sets, are decorated in Salins Style I and spiral ornamentation. Typologically, they can be dated to the period AD 450‚Äì510e.g. Haseloff 1981; N√§sman 1984b; Magnus 1997, 2002; Kristoffersen 1999; Fischer & Victor 2011. Excavations have been undertaken by Kalmar County Museum annually since 2011. Already in the first campaign, human remains were found inside houses showing that a violent event occurred at the site probably in the late 5th century AD. After the excavation season 2017, some 9% of the ringfort have been excavated including three of the 53 houses. The results include some fascinating snapshots from everyday life at the fort as well as the gruesome evidence of a brutal mass killing, with a minimum number of 26 individuals identified of which 9 are represented by more or less complete bodiesAlfsdotter, C. 2018.

Many of the skeletons show clear evidence of sharp force and blunt force trauma, typically inflicted from above or from behind. This suggests that the killing was an act of execution rather than a regular battle. The fact that the bodies have not been buried but were found lying where they fell has created unique archaeological source material and a snapshot of Migration period violence.

The research project The excavations at Sandby borg was started at a very small scale, in the first years financed by Kalmar County Museum in collaboration with the local authorities. In December 2014, the project successfully raised funds via a Kickstarter campaign to finance the excavations in 2015. This included the complete excavation of House #40, where several skeletons had been found during previous campaigns. The target was SEK 400,000, and the Kickstarter campaign managed to raise SEK 465,619 before the deadline of midnight 31 December 2014.

Museiarkeologi sydost, Kalmar l√§ns museum. Sandby borgs skrifter 7.. During 2016‚Äì2018, the project has been funded by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation. This allowed the full excavation of House 4 in 2016 and House 52 in 2017. The focus of the project is the excavation and subsequent osteological and bioarchaeological analysis of the human skeletal remains, in order to further understand the demography of the victims in the massacre at Sandby borg. The Sandby borg research project is headed by archaeologists Dr. Helena Victor and Dr. Ludvig Papmehl-Dufay, both at Kalmar County museum. Archaeologist and physical anthropologist Clara Alfsdotter of Bohusl√§ns museum is responsible for the osteological analysis together with Associate Professor Anna Kjellstr√∂m at the Osteoarchaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University. Bioarchaeological analyses are carried out under the supervision of Associate Prof Gunilla Eriksson, Prof Kerstin Lid√©n and Prof Anders G√∂therstr√∂m at the Archaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University. A sub-project looking into the cultural heritage of Sandby borg and its implication for present society is headed by Associate Prof Bodil Petersson at Linnaeus University. Development of digital presentation and documentation of fieldwork is headed by Nicholas Nilsson and Fredrik Gunnarsson at Kalmar County Museum. Since 2014, the project also employs a professional photographer, Daniel Lindskog, and a film-maker, Sebastian Jakobsson. The artefacts recovered during the excavations is preserved by conservator Max Jahrehorn of Oxider. Gallery File:Sandby Borg.jpgSandby Borg towards north-west.

Interview with Samuel Lloyd Myers Sr. Samuel Myers. Education Makers. http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/samuel-myers-39 (sept. 2014). One of Myers' most significant contributions to society occurred during his 18-year tenure as the president of the National Association for Equal Opportunity (NAFEO)National Association for Equal Opportunity (NAFEO) where he fought to sustain the establishment of historically black colleges by providing them access to a billion dollars of federal aid.Denise, B. Hawkins. \\"Myers to End 18 Years a NAFEO Top Executive: Perceptions of Personal, Organizational Legacy to Influence Future.\\" Black Issues in Higher Education. August 24th 1995.  Early life and education  Samuel Myers was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in April 1919, to David and Edith Myers, Jamaican immigrants. Myers attended Fredrick Douglas High School,Fredrick Douglas High School which was segregated but renowned, where he graduated in 1936. During his time there, he was the editor of the school newspaper, a varsity football player, and participant on the debate team. Myers attended Morgan State College where he planned on majoring in chemistry. Upon taking a semester to travel and work, he was impacted by the overwhelming disparities, specifically in poverty, that he witnessed on his travels.Kenneth J. Cooper, \\"Family Matters.\\" Diverse: Issues in Higher Education, vol. 29, Issue 20, pg. 11-13, Nov. 8, 2012. Upon returning to college, he concluded that his focus would be in the social sciences and committed his education and life's work to combat these issues. After graduating from Morgan State with a B.A. in social sciences, Myers enrolled at Boston University, where he attained an M.A. degree in economics, writing a thesis titled \\"Consumers' Cooperation: A Plan for the Negro\\".\\"Consumers' Cooperation: A Plan for the Negro\\"Samuel L. Myers Jr; Lawrence Karongo. The Production of Black Ph.Ds. in Economics at Harvard University, 1905-1955. 2014. His thesis speaks to the lack of successful cooperatives in the United States compared to European nations, and more so the lack of local Negro cooperatives. Myers speaks of the benefit of cooperatives to African Americans in the long run in ways of increased consumer bargaining power and concerted action power. The thesis illustrates the plan as a social economic salvation for African Americans, which is also noted in Jessica Gordon Nembhard's book Collective Courage: A History of African American Cooperative Economic Thought and Preface.Collective Courage: A History of African American Cooperative Economic Thought and Preface After graduation, Myers was drafted into the Army and was stationed in a training school at Camp Lee, Alabama. Despite eventually rising to the rank of captain, he faced racial discrimination, which was still very present in the Army during this period. He and other black soldiers were often subject to cleaning the barracks of white soldiers. At one point, Myers was nearly court marshaled after protesting the exclusion of black officers from the general officers' club. He was later stationed in Okinawa, Japan, where he guarded Japanese prisoners of war. After the war, Myers went on to pursue his doctorate degree in economics at Harvard University. He was a recipient of the coveted Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, which assisted him in completing his doctorate in 1949. At Harvard, Myers studied under famous economists such as John D. Black, Sumner Slichter, Gottfried Haberler, and Joseph Schumpeter. John Kenneth Gabraith was his advisor as he worked on completing his Ph.D. thesis, titled \\"Product Testing and Labeling with Special References to Textiles\\".\\"Product Testing and Labeling with Special References to Textiles\\" The dissertation focuses on the exploitation of consumers through marketing techniques in order to attain the highest revenues. The main focus of the thesis was on the production, distribution, consumption, and protection of the consumer.Samuel L. Myers Sr., Interview by Samuel L. Myers Jr., March 11, 2014, Transcript. Myers was one of the first African Americans to receive a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University.  Professional career  Through his relationship with and tutelage under John D. Black, Myers was exposed to numerous governmental positions. In April 1950, he was hired as a research economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the U.S. Department of Labor. Shortly thereafter, he concluded his track in that department and became a professor at Morgan State University, his alma mater. There, he taught economics, was the chair of the Social Science Department, and taught many distinguished students such as Earl Graves, Sr., the founder of Black Enterprise. From 1963 to 1967, Myers returned to the public sector, working as an adviser for the Inter-American Affairs in the U.S. State Department. In 1967 he became the president of Bowie State University.\\"Takes Pay Cut.\\" Joplin News Herald, March 6, 1967. During his term, Myers was known as a strong advocate of success in the classroom and rewarded such success with presidential recognition. As the new leader of Bowie, he increased and expanded the university's curriculum, and increased student enrollment. He left Bowie State in 1977, accepting the chair position of the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education. In 1998, he served as the Chairman of Minority Access Incorporated,Minority Access Incorporated which works to diversify campuses and corporate work sites. = The 1968 Bowie State protests = Taking a pay cut and leaving the state department, Myers accepted a position as the president of Bowie State in 1967. The students of the university held that Bowie lacked a curriculum on African American history, and that it failed to provide adequate dormitory accommodations. In short, the students were seeking overall education reform.Stephen Marrow, \\"Bowie Students Bow to Threats.\\" The Afro American, April 6, 1968. For the students, the issue did not lie in the administration of the school, but in the state government and its consistent lack of attention to their needs. Governor Spiro T. Agnew, along with his education official, refused to meet with or listen to the students. Instead, Agnew provided ultimatums to the students, ordering them to vacate the buildings or be met with force.\\"Bowie Students Jailed.\\" The Baltimore Afro American, April 6, 1968. However, Myers was able to calm the students, bringing their focus back on education. Myers' wife Marion is also credited as being a critical figure in subduing the tensions of students. She aided in the positive image of her husband as she spoke with the students in the midst of protests. She invited them to her and her husband's campus home, often late at night, and gave them home cooked meals.\\"Marion Myers; Teacher, Figure at Bowie State.\\" Washington Post, Dec. 27, 2006. With only a few students arrested in the midst of the protests, the riots for the most part worked in favor of the students. The protests received national attention, provoking a visit to the school from Attorney General Francis B. Burch, during which he confirmed the inadequate conditions of several facilities. In early April 1968, the school protests ended. = National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education = After retiring from Bowie State College in 1977, Myers was named president of the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO). NAFEO was founded in 1969 in Washington D.C., and its mission was to represent historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) across the nation in higher education.\\"With Marketing Insight, Black Universities Increase Enrollment.\\" New Pittsburg Courier, April 24, 1993. Myers spent the next 18 years as the president, the longest term in the organization's history.Kenneth J. Cooper, \\"Family Matters.\\" Diverse: Issues in Higher Education, vol. 29, Issue 20, pg. 11-13, Nov. 8, 2012. While in office, Myers became NAFEO's second leader, working instrumentally to stabilize its finances and counsel current leaders of the represented black colleges. During this period, the organization oversaw 117 black colleges and universities. NAFEO helped them fight an upheaval of minimum funding due to a lack of endowments, especially during tough economic times.James Kilpatrick. \\"Group Links Black Talent with Jobs.\\" The Joplin Globe, Nov. 20, 1984. NAFEO also focused on empowering black students. The need to provide career opportunities to hardworking, intelligent black students was clear to Myers and the organization. In the fall of November 1984, NAFEO held a reception announcing the plan to introduce one hundred corporations to its own Student Talent Identification Bank. With this, the organization could pair the brightest, most motivated students in black colleges and universities with top executives from corporations around the world. This effort saw great fulfillment as many students took on the opportunity, and further down the road were continuously recognized at the annual National Conference on Blacks in Higher Education.\\"NAFEO to Convene Confab.\\" Washington Informer, April 13, 1983. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, enrollment was decreasing at black colleges and universities, and funding was an undeniable problem. When Myers took office at NAFEO, the U.S. government was in the midst of deciding whether to sustain funding for these institutions. Much of the country's focus was on establishing and increasing the prestige of \\"white, Ivy League and research institutions\\". The lack of education about and focus on HBCUs was leading the institutions on a path of deterioration. In the 1960s, as the integration of segregated schools occurred, the perception was that black institutions were no longer necessary. As Myers explains it, the feeling was that \\"there was no longer a need for Black Colleges\\".Therefore, allocating federal aid to these institutions was thought of as unnecessary. Furthermore, during this period there were no committed individuals who had the influence or the funds to help support and maintain historically black colleges. As the president of NAFEO, Myers' solution was to push the federal government to realize the need to sustain these institutions and provide the necessary funding. By hiring the attorney support of Kenneth S. Tollett Sr. and William Blakey, along with gaining the support and aid of influential higher education associations, NAFEO's press on the U.S. Federal Government became indubitably strong. With this front, Myers and his team were able to persuade President Jimmy Carter to pour a billion dollars into historically black colleges and universities, and lobby Congress to pass what is now known as the Higher Education Act Title III.Christina James. \\"Part 1: Papers of the Special Assistant for Black Affairs, Section B.\\" Civil Rights During the Carter Administration, 1977-1981. 2007.

Early life Aowen Jin was born in Luoyang, Henan in China. She moved to the United Kingdom as a student when she was 18, and initially studied Law & Economics at Durham University. After rediscovering a passion for art she switched to studying Fine Art at Goldsmiths, University of London. During her degree she was commissioned to produce painting works for British Prime Minister Tony Blair and for Queen Elizabeth II's 80th Birthday, and was named by both Dazed & Confused magazine and The Times Magazine as one of the UK's top emerging artists. Aowen was part of Goldsmith's graduate exhibition at Free Range Shows in 2006, titled \\"Textile Collective\\". One Child Policy exhibition In 2010, Jin interviewed 300 Chinese women for her \\"Made in China: One Child\\" exhibition, which was exhibited in London and at the 2010 Shanghai Expo. The exhibition explored both positive and negative impacts of China's One Child Policy, especially on the first generation of women born under the policy. The show created extensive discussion about the policy in the British press, including on BBC Impact Asia, BBC China, BBC Woman's Hour, Stylist magazine and The Times. Social commentary Following the One Child Policy exhibition, Jin became a regular social commentator on issues related to Chinese women, including on Al Jazeera, China Daily and various programmes for the BBC. In October 2013 she was asked to review the Chinese Masters exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum for the flagship BBC arts show, Front Row. In 2013 she was one of the 100 women selected for the BBC's 100 Women Conference, and in 2014 was asked to present a contribution for UNESCO's World Radio Day. In addition to commentating for media organisations, Jin also provides Chinese cultural consultancy to investment banks and corporations. Factory Girls exhibition From 2012 to 2013, Jin lived undercover with factory workers in Southern China's Guangdong, and worked with them to create performance art for her 2013 Factory Girls exhibition. The exhibition compared the modern perception of China's female factory workers to their day-to-day reality, and was covered by BBC Outlook, BBC Weekend, BBC Chinese and Ms. magazine. The exhibition was also accompanied by a documentary about China's factory girls, featuring Martin Jacques and Leslie T. Chang. In March 2014 Jin was asked to present her Factory Girls exhibition at the Southbank Centre's Women of The World Festival. Sound Fountain In 2013, Jin was commissioned by Goldsmiths, University of London to produce an artwork for the first official visit of British Chancellor George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson to Beijing. For the commission she produced a live \\"Sound Fountain\\", made of common British garden equipment, which danced to sounds that were transmitted live from various locations around London. The artwork was exhibited in Beijing's 798 Art Zone. Light artworks In early 2015, Jin announced that she would be creating an permanent exhibit called \\"i18n\\" at the Horniman Museum, launching in February 2015, made up of invisible paintings that could only be seen under UV light. On announcing the exhibition at the museum she said: \\"The founder of the museum had the most extensive collection of Chinese tea artifacts in the world. He tried to bring Chinese culture and lives back to Britain through objects and steam ships. I will try bring them to the local community by using gods and technology.\\" Following this project, Jin was commissioned by Birmingham Hippodrome and Arts Council England to use artworks to engage with Birmingham's Chinese community. Her artwork, named \\"Midlight\\", was an interactive light show that reacted to sound and posts on Twitter. It was exhibited at Birmingham Hippodrome, Birmingham Cathedral, and Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum in late 2015, culminating in a Chinese New Year show at the Cathedral in February 2016. In 2016 it was announced that Jin was selected for that year's Museums at Night project, where a new light artwork would be shown in a UK museum chosen by the public.

She was one of a number of European-trained jewellers who came to New Zealand in the 1960s and transformed contemporary jewellery in that country, including Jens Hoyer Hansen, Kobi Bosshard and Gunter Taemmler. Ashken attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London, where she was awarded a diploma in silversmithing in 1960, and also studied sculpture at the Atelier de Del Debbio in Paris the following year. She began making jewellery in semi-precious materials in 1962. She does not draw a distinction between her jewellery and her sculpture: ‚Äúher jewellery is small sculpture that can be worn.‚Äù Ashken married New Zealand artist John Drawbridge (1930‚Äì2005) in 1960 and emigrated to New Zealand in 1963. In 1966 her work was included in Recent New Zealand Sculpture at the Auckland City Art Gallery. Ashken's albatross sculpture on the Wellington waterfront from above In 1967 Ashken was the second artist to be awarded the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship, an opportunity for her to spend a year in Dunedin developing ideas for large sculptures. After this Ashken attracted a number of major commissions, including Seabird V (1974) for the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra and her best-known work, the water sculpture Albatross (1986) in Frank Kitts Park, Wellington. This was a first commission for the Wellington Sculpture Trust. Hone Tuwhare wrote a poem to mark the occasion.

Biography Patrizia Caraveo graduated in Physics at University of Milan in 1977. After a period abroad, in 2002 she began working at the Institute of Cosmic Physics in Milan as Director of Research, and is currently Director of the institute. She has worked on several international space missions dedicated to particle physics, starting with the European mission Cos-B. She is currently involved in the European INTEGRAL mission, the NASA Swift mission, the Italian AGILE mission and the NASA Fermi mission, all of which are now in orbit and fully operational. Her main field of interest is the behavior of neutron stars at different wavelengths. She was among the first to understand the fundamental role of neutron stars in particle physics.P. Caraveo, G.F. Bignami, J. Tr√ºmper - Radio-Silent Isolated Neutron Stars as a New Astronomical Reality - A. & A. Review, 7, 209. After years of efforts to explain the first unidentified pulsar radio emission, she identified the neutron star Geminga. She has developed a multi-wavelength strategy for the identification of galactic gamma-ray sources. She is a member of the International Astronomical Union. Since 1997, Caraveo has worked as an adjunct professor at the University of Pavia. She is married to the physicist Giovanni Bignami. Research Her first ten years' research were devoted almost entirely to the analysis and interpretation of data collected from gamma astronomy satellite Cos-B, and the beginning of the study of X-ray astronomy with the analysis of data collected by the Einstein Observatory and EXOSAT. In the following period, her interests widened to include all of multi-wavelength astronomy, especially optical astronomy and interpretation of its results. Since her thesis work, Caraveo has taken part in the development of multi- wavelength observations that led to the discovery and understanding of the neutron star Geminga. This required the use of multiple optical instruments both on the ground and in space. She has used observations from satellites such as SAS-2, HEAO-1, Cos-B, Einstein, EXOSAT, Ginga, ROSAT, Egret, EUVE, Hubble, Hipparcos, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, in addition to ground-based telescopes such as the Very Large Array. The results of Geminga have opened a new chapter in astrophysics: the study of unidentified gamma-ray sources. This is now one of the main topics of research by several groups around the world. Her identification of Geminga, the first neutron star to show no radio emissions, has opened the way for a more general study of the phenomenology and number of optical pulsars. Caraveo and her team are dedicated to studying the color, motions, and distances of neutron stars, along with the relationship between neutron stars and young supernova remnants. With the use of parallax with Geminga, Caraveo accomplished the first optical measurement of the distance to an isolated neutron star. The correlation of data from Hipparcos with images from the Hubble Space Telescope to determine the absolute position of the faint optical counterpart of Geminga, was chosen by the European Space Agency as one of the 30 success stories presented at the Ministerial Conference in May 1999 (see ESA BR 147). Caraveo's continuous improvement to the techniques of analysis of data from the Hubble Space Telescope allowed the measurement of the proper motion of the Crab pulsar and then proper motion and parallax of the pulsar in the constellation of Sails, yielding a result much closer than she had expected. In both cases there was a significant alignment between the direction of the proper motion vector and the X-ray jets revealed by these two neutron stars. This alignment has profound implications for the physics of the explosion of supernovae. Using the telescope XMM-Newton, Caraveo has contributed to the first direct measurement of the magnetic field of an isolated neutron star, thanks to the discovery of cyclotron absorption lines in the data source 1E1207-59, a neutron star at the center of a supernova with no radio counterpart. The high sensitivity of XMM-Newton has also resulted in two major findings on Geminga. The star, as it moves with supersonic speed in the interstellar medium, generates a shock wave that produces a train of X-rays. This allows scientists to probe both the density of the interstellar medium and the energy of the accelerated electrons from the source. The result, with Caraveo as first author, was published in Science, on September 5, 2003 (which devoted its cover to XMM-Newton), and has received substantial coverage in the Italian and world press. Observations from Chandra also revealed a tail that follows the pulsar, perfectly aligned with its proper motion. It could be the PWN (pulsar wind nebula) of Geminga. While several other pulsars have comet tails of this type, the combination between the large structures revealed by XMM-Newton and the new data from Chandra is unprecedented. The data accumulated by XMM-Newton enabled Caraveo to take a significant step in understanding Geminga through studying the spectrum of the source as a function of phase. This suggests that some observations of the star are due to a small hot spot which rotates with the star. The result, with Caraveo as first author, published in Science on July 16, 2004, is of great importance for the understanding of the physics of neutron stars, as the technique developed for Geminga is applicable to other neutron stars. Geminga is not the only example of a pulsar without radio emission. The satellite Fermi has discovered dozens of others, demonstrating that the predictions made on the basis of the phenomenology of Geminga were fundamentally correct. Following the publication of the catalog of gamma sources revealed by Fermi, Caraveo coordinated a program centered on the study of unidentified gamma-ray sources. The purpose of the exercise is to find sources with the highest ratio of X-ray to optical emissions, one of the characteristic signs of neutron stars. Coordination efforts In addition to data analysis, Caraveo was responsible for the study and planning of new missions. She was part of the Astronomy Working Group of the European Space Agency and contributed to the study and selection of new missions. After involvement in the spectrometer of INTEGRAL, Caraveo was part of the group proposing ESA's participation in the James Webb Space Telescope (then the New Generation Space Telescope) In parallel, Caraveo took part in the development of new high-energy astrophysics missions such as the AGILE mission of the Italian Space Agency and the Swift and GLAST missions of NASA, for which she holds the position of Co-Investigator. Caraveo is also responsible for the contract the Italian Space Agency (ASI) signed for the financing of activities related to astrophysical mission GLAST (now Fermi) of NASA. Within ASTRONET, Caraveo was co-chair of the panel dedicated to high-energy astrophysics. Caraveo was vice-coordinator of the panel of Italy's aerospace National Operational Program (NOP). She is currently responsible for the participation of INAF in the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Awards Caraveo shared the Bruno Rossi Prize of the American Astronomical Society with colleagues in 2007, 2011, and 2012 for work on the Swift, Fermi, and Agile projects. She was awarded the Italian National Presidential Prize in 2009 for contributions to the understanding of the issue of high energy neutron stars. In March 2014 she received the \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" from Women in Aerospace-Europe. In June 2014 Thomson Reuters included her in the list of \\"Highly Cited Researchers\\" in the discipline \\"Space Science\\".

Cole Brigham, Shelter Island, New York, 1912 Walter Cole Brigham (January 11, 1870 - August 7, 1941) was an American artist, now best known for his innovative stained glass techniques incorporating transparent shells, pebbles, and beach glass, and for his illustrations of pulp magazines. Brigham was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Marion B. and William Theodore Brigham, who owned the Swift Meat Packing Company of Baltimore and the Greenport Shipbuilding Company of Shelter Island, New York. As a child, he lived at 406 Pressman Street in Baltimore. In 1888 he graduated from high school and entered Johns Hopkins University, but became ill in 1892 and did not complete his degree. He also studied at the Decorative and Maryland Institute Schools, received art training from Andr√© Castaigne, and later studied with William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) at the Art Students League. On December 8, 1892, the World's Fair Commission chose his design for the Maryland Medal. In 1898 he spent a year in Florence, Italy, studying art, returning in 1899 to his parents' home on Shelter Island. In 1906 he completed a stained glass window in memory of Brooklyn banker Frederick A. Schroeder in the Union Chapel in the Grove on Shelter Island, and in 1909 he created a similar design for actor William Gillette's houseboat. On September 23, 1911, he married Jeanette Lawson, with whom he had two sons. By 1926 he had begun to illustrate magazines, including Ginger, Pep, and Hot Stuff, and in 1928 his work began to appear in pulp magazines, including covers for Clues Detective Stories, The Dragnet, Rangeland Love, Popular Engineering Stories, and The Underworld. From 1935 to 1939 his drawings appeared in comic books produced by Centaur Comics, Harry \\"A\\" Chesler, DC Comics and Dell Publishing. Brigham died in 1941 at Shelter Harbor.

Chem. Soc. , 1954, 2664‚Äì2668. Biography Robinson was born on 6 February 1886 in Winsford, Cheshire and died of a heart attack on 1 March 1954. After attending Verdin Secondary School, she was granted her B. Sc. in 1907 and M. Sc. in 1908 from Owens College. She then researched at the University of Manchester under Chaim Weizmann, who later became the first president of Israel, and taught chemistry at the Manchester High School for Girls. left In 1912 she married Robert Robinson, who later won the 1947 Nobel Prize and with whom she coauthored many papers, and moved to the position of an unpaid demonstrator at the University of SydneyRayner-Canham, M.; Rayner-Canham, G. Chemistry Was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880-1949, Imperial College Press: London, 2008. 435-438. before briefly going to the St. Andrews in Scotland and University College in London. She worked on the syntheses of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and was the first to synthesize oleic acid and lactarinic acid. Her methods led to her synthesis of fatty acids with the greatest molecular weights of the time (specifically, tricontanoic and 13-oxodotetracontanoic acids). Tetraphenylpyrrole She also independently suggested the asymmetric structure of aromatic azoxy-compounds and, with her husband, postulated a mechanism for the Fischer Indole Synthesis. Based on this mechanism and working off the pyrrole syntheses of Piloty, the couple provided a method for synthesizing tetraphenylpyrrole . The Piloty-Robinson Pyrrole Synthesis is named in their honor.Olson, J.A.; Shea, K.M. Acc. Chem. Res., 2011, 44(5), 311‚Äì321. After moving to the University of Oxford, Gertrude Robinson began studying plant pigments and published extensively on anthocyanins with her husband.Ogilvie, M.; Harvey, J. The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science, Stratford Publishing: New York, 2000. She was the first to observe that the color of a plant‚Äôs pigment was not related to the pH of its sap and she pioneered work in leucoanthocyanins. Additionally, she was the first to synthesize Œ¥-hexenolactone, a molecule similar to penicillin that had its antibiotic properties. In 1953, the University of Oxford granted her an honorary M.A. degree. Besides her work as a chemist, Gertrude Robinson had two children, Marion in 1921 and Michael in 1926. She was an avid mountain climber, a prolific traveler, and a frequent hostess. Perhaps inspiring her work on plant pigments, she and her husband also kept a garden for many years. Plant Genetics =Anthocyanins and Copigments= Flowers, fruits, and leaves get their pigments from anthocyanins and copigments (such as tannins and flavonols). The combinations provide the exact colors of various plants at different stages of development.Robinson, G.M. J. Chem. Soc., 1939, 61, 1606-1607. The Robinsons found that, at different ratios of anthocyanins to copigments, the copigments had different effects and they postulated that this was due to the copigments breaking up the anthocyanin complexes, which they observed when they were in solution together.Robinson, G.M.; Robinson, R. Biochem., 1934, 1687-1720. They studied these pigments by comparing color distributions in immiscible solutions after reactions with alkalis or ferric chloride.Robinson, G.M.; Robinson, R. Biochem., 1931, 1687-1705. =Leucoanthocyanins= The Robinsons investigated the structure of leucoanthocyanins, colorless molecules that generate anthocyanidins and are present in most plants. Rosenheim simultaneously discovered leucoanthocyanins and he coined the term.Robinson, G.M.; Robinson, R. Biochem., 1932, 206-212. Leucoanthocyanins occur in more locations (wood, bark, nutshells, flowers, fruits) than normal anthocyanins.Lawrence, W. J. C.; Price, J.R.; Robinson, G.M.; Robinson, R. Biochem., 1938, 1661-1667. The precursor to cyanidin chloride (an anthocyanidin) and its tautomer Piloty-Robinson Pyrrole Synthesis This reaction, originally named after Piloty, had the Robinson name added to it due to their work on the mechanism. While it is unclear which Robinson the synthesis is technically named after, the paper on the topic was authored by both Gertrude and Robert. =Generalized Synthesis= This reaction is used to convert azines to 3,4-disubstituted pyrroles. The conversion of azines to 3,4-disubstituted pyrroles using the Piloty-Robinson Pyrrole Synthesis. Example of the Robinsons' synthesis of tetraphenyl pyrrole =Generalized Mechanism= The mechanism as suggested by the Robinsons.Robinson, G.M.; Robinson, R. J. Chem. Soc., Trans., 1918, 113, 639-645.Wang, Z. Comprehensive Organic Name Reactions and Reagents, Wiley: Hoboken, 2010.Mundy, B.P.; Ellerd, M.G.; Favaloro, F.G. Name Reactions and Reagents in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: Hoboken, 2005, 510-511. The mechanism for the Piloty-Robinson Pyrrole Synthesis suggested by Gertrude and Robert Robinson. There are, however, a few problems with some syntheses. The Piloty-Robinson reaction competes with the formation of pyrazoline when the reactant is an aliphatic azine derived from a ketone. Also, under high temperatures and highly acidic solutions, azines derived from aldehydes are not stable. This prevents the formation of 2,5-disubstituted pyrroles (where R=H) using this method.Leeper, F.J.; Kelly, J.M. Organic Preparations and Procedures International: The New Journal for Organic Synthesis, 2013, 45:3, 171-210. =Modern Uses= While the pyrroles produced by the Piloty-Robinson Synthesis are often very useful, the reaction itself is not always favorable because it requires high temperatures and long reaction times in addition to the problems mentioned above, the yield is often low or moderate.Milgram, B.C.; Eskildsen, K.; Richter, S.M.; Scheidt, W.R.; Scheidt, K. A. J. Org. Chem., 2007, 72, 3941-3944. Modern methods have alleviated some of these concerns. Microwave Irradiation Microwave radiation decreases the time necessary for the reaction from around 3 days to 30-60 min. It can also affect the yield. Example of a Piloty-Robinson Pyrrole Synthesis via Microwave Irradiation Solid-Supported Solid-supported syntheses offer an easier and more efficient workup and purification.Tanaka, H..; Moriwaki, M.; Takahashi, T. Org. Lett., 2003, 5, 3807-3809. Example of a solid-supported Piloty-Robinson Synthesis Fischer Indole Mechanism The Robinsons disproved many of the prevailing theories about the Fischer Indole Mechanism by showing that the reaction went unperturbed in the presence of other aromatic amines such as p-toluidine. This is the mechanism they suggested (where hydrogen shifts may also be interpreted as hydrogen exchanges in acid). The Fischer Indole Mechanism as interpreted by the Robinsons. Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids =Methods of Synthesis of Higher Fatty Acids= One of the drawbacks of the Robinsons‚Äô methods for the synthesis of fatty acids are the low yields due to the recoveries of a significant portion of the dialdehyde. The justification by Gertrude Robinson for this low yield was that the aldehyde intermediate was a weaker acid than acetic acid, which was removed during a step in the hydrolysis. While she did not solve this problem, she did improve the yield and decrease the dialdehyde recovered by ‚Äúthe acylation of a substituted ethyl acetoacetate by the group related to the weakest possible acid‚Äù.Robinson, G.M. J. Chem. Soc., 1930, 745-751. Robinsons synthesis of higher fatty acids. One example of this is the synthesis of 10-ketotridecoic acid via 13-diketopalmitic acid, which is an important acid because, with reduction and dehydration, it becomes the molecule that is an active ovarian hormone. Gertrude Robinson, using her methods for the synthesis of higher fatty acids, synthesized n-triacontanoic acid, also known as Melissic acid, and 13-oxodotetracontanoic acid.Robinson, G.M. J. Chem. Soc., 1934, 1543-1545. Gertrude Robinson's synthesis of n-triacontanoic acid. =Oleic Acid= The Robinsons identified the location of the double bond in, and also synthesized, oleic acid. The Robinsons‚Äô Synthesis of Oleic Acid The Robinsons' Synthesis of Oleic Acid =Lactarinic Acid= Lactarinic Acid, isolated from fungi of the Lactarius genus, was shown to contain a ketostearic acid.Nature, 1911, 87, 442. The Robinsons showed that this was in fact 6-ketostearic acid by doing a Beckmann Transformation Sluiter, C.H.; Lobry de Bruyn, C.A. KNAW, Proceedings, 1904, 6, 773-778. on the oxime of lactarinic acid. They then synthesized 6-ketostearic acid via a reaction of ethyl sodio-2-acetyl-n-tridecoate and 5-carbethoxyvaleryl chloride and then hydrolysis to prove the structure of lactarinic acid.Robinson, G.M.; Robinson, R. J. Chem. Soc., 1925, 127, 175-180.

Grenville According to the 1895 work of the family's historian Rev. Roger Granville, Rector of Bideford, the descent of the manor of Bideford in North Devon, England, was as follows:Granville, Roger, M.A., (Rector of Bideford).

He obtained from FitzHamon the lordship of Neath, Glamorgan, in which he built Neath Castle and in 1129 founded Neath Abbey. Richard de Grenville is by tradition the founder and ancestor of the prominent Westcountry Grenville family of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon. By tradition Richard de Grenville is said by Prince (died 1723),Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, p.440, biography of Sir Theobald Grenvil (apparently following Fuller's Worthies)Round, p. 138.) after he had founded Neath Abbey and bestowed upon it all his military acquisitions for its maintenance, to have \\"returned to his patrimony at Bideford where he lived in great honour and reputation the rest of his days\\". However, according to Round no proof exists that Richard de Grenville ever held the manor of Bideford, which was later one of the principal seats of the Westcountry Grenville family. It was however certainly one of the constituent manors of the Honour of Gloucester granted by King William Rufus to Robert FitzHamon.\\" Richard de Grenville is known to have held seven knight's fees from the Honour of Gloucester, either granted to him by his FitzHamon or the latter's son-in-law and heir Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1100‚Äì1147). Round supposes that the Grenvilles of Bideford and Stowe were instead descended from a certain \\"Robert de Grenville\\" (alias de Grainville, de Grainavilla, etc.) who was a junior witness to Richard's foundation charter of Neath Abbey and who in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return was listed as holding one knight's fee from the Earl of Gloucester, feudal baron of Gloucester. Robert's familial relationship, if any, to Richard is unknown. =Richard de Grenville (fl. late 12th century)= Richard de Grenville (eldest son, by tradition).

A weekly farmers' market takes place in the surrounding park.  History  The first Livermore Library was organized in 1875 by the Livermore Library and Dramatic Association. It initially had a collection of 250 books. Members of the public were asked to pay three dollars a year for a family membership (or twenty dollars for a lifetime membership) for the privilege of borrowing books. In 1878, the Livermore Public Library Association was organized to manage the operation. This association raised funds to build a library building, but closed in 1887, after public interest waned. The books were stored in the local newspaper office.\\"Livermore Carnegie Library and Park.\\" National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. Retrieved November 30, 2014. The Livermore Ladies League of Progress reopened the library in 1896, naming it the Livermore Free Library. They created a new \\"corporation of public benefit\\" and sold shares to purchase the former library building. In 1901, the city took over the free library and put it under municipal control and financial support. By then, the library's inventory had grown to 3,500 books. Led by Mrs. Dell C. Savage, president of the library board, Livermore began its campaign to obtain a library grant from the Carnegie Foundation in 1908. A formal application was made and a grant of $10,000 was approved that year. The city agreed to match the grant by providing $1,000 per year for ten years, provide land for the building, and support the operation with tax money. A bond election was scheduled for December 17, 1909. The election passed easily, supported by the San Francisco Chronicle and the Livermore Valley Improvement Association.

He also designed the decorative fountain at the foot of the library entrance steps. Hoyt Brothers were paid $10,640 to construct the building. Several Livermore residents and local farmers furnished volunteer labor to assist the construction effort. = Exterior = The architectural style is Greek Revival, Temple style.

The facility is owned by Vestre Viken Hospital Trust and is situated next to Hallingdal Medical Center. History During the 1980s NLA set up an annual Easter base in a winter resort in the mountains of Southern Norway. The first was in Beitost√∏len in 1982. The following years this base was situated at Rjukan; Domb√•s; Fagernes Airport, Leirin; and Geilo Airport, Dagali, respectively.Andersen: 139 This proved popular with decision-makes, and a 1986 government commission recommended that a permanent base be established at Domb√•s. It opened along with five other bases in 1988, establishing the state-funded helicopter ambulance service. The Easter bases spurred interest amongst locals in the interior valleys of Buskerud, Oppdal and Telemark to receive a permanent helicopter ambulance service. Locals in Hallingdal were not content with being left without a helicopter ambulance. They argued that as it was, only during the week city-dwellers spent in town did the area have the same coverage as other parts of the country. Gradually two more bases were opened, in Arendal and F√∏rde. Locally there was political support from three county councils and local activism.Andersen: 166 The Ministry of Social Affairs concluded in 1993 that √Öl was feasible. However, the annual 8 to 10 million Norwegian krone in funding would have to be allocated from other sources. Political work started in 1992, but the Ministry of Social Affairs did not prioritize it in its 1994 budget. However, this resulted in a series of political initiatives from the area and when Parliament voted over the budget, grants had been allocated.Andersen: 167 Operations commenced on 1 September 1994,Andersen: 168 as the eleventh helicopter ambulance base in the country. The base took over missions previously designated to Domb√•s Heliport, Brunshaugen and L√∏renskog Heliport, Central Hospital. The base was manned with three pilots, three rescue swimmers, a secretary, a technician, an instructor and ten part-time physicians. Ownership of the base was issued to Buskerud Central Hospital.

History =Establishment= 2 Towns Ciderhouse was launched in 2010 by three Oregonians ‚Äî Lee Larsen, a graduate in finance from Oregon State University, Dave Takush, a fermentation science graduate from the same school, and graphic designer Aaron Sarnoff-Wood, a graduate of the University of Oregon.Theresa Hogue, \\"OSU Alums Rule the Ciderhouse,\\" Life@OSU: The Lives and Stories of Oregon State University, www.oregonstate.edu/ Dec. 3, 2012. Sarnoff-Wood initially wanted to start a brewpub and contacted his friend Larsen, who shared a love for home brewing, to discuss the idea.Nancy Raskauskas, \\"'Hard Core' Craftsmen,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, Jan. 18, 2011. High projected startup costs made this idea impractical, however, and the concept was abandoned. The pair became interested in the fermentation of apple cider to create hard cider. A test batch was made to be served in 2009 at Larsen's brother's wedding,Laura McCandlish, \\"Corvallis' 2 Towns Ciderhouse Delivers the Goods with Artisan Brews,\\" The Oregonian, March 20, 2012. which proved extremely popular with guests ‚Äî and the trio were inspired by the positive reaction to launch a commercial enterprise specializing in the beverage. 2 Towns Ciderhouse was launched in 2010 from a small 1,000 square foot space in the Eastgate Business Center, located between Corvallis and Albany, Oregon.Bennett Hall, \\"Thirst for Cider Fuels 2 Towns' Growth,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, Oct. 31, 2013. Despite the firm's location between the small cities of Corvallis and Albany, the brand name was actually a reference to the college towns of Corvallis and Eugene, from which the three founding partners hailed. The company sold approximately 100 cases a month during its first year of operations.Denise Ruttan, \\"Cider Makers Become Orchardists to Meet Demand,\\" Capital Press, Sept. 23, 2014. =Expansion= Fermentation tanks and aging barrels at the 2 Towns Ciderhouse brewing facility. In 2012 the need for addition production capacity forced a move to a 10,000 square foot space in the same industrial park from which the company was launched. Production and demand continued to expand rapidly, forcing a second move to a still-larger 15,000 square foot facility located in another industrial park in Corvallis. To meet demand 2 Towns has entered into production contracts with several orchards, agreeing to purchase the outputs of several thousand trees. The company also launched its own orchard in 2012, making use of dwarf rootstocks from old orchards which had produced cider-friendly apple varieties in a previous era. This orchard was anticipated to produce sufficient apples for between 5,000 and 7,000 cases of cider in 2015. =Product line= The first two varieties released commercially by 2 Towns were Incider, an accessible semi-sweet beverage, and \\"Bad Apple,\\" a dry and higher octane brew. Most of the 2 Towns product line are varieties of traditional fermented apple cider, generally with an alcohol content between 6 and 7 percent. Other specialty varieties are made, however, included a pear cider based beverage and other creations using a range of additive flavoring ingredients such as marionberry, cinnamon, rhubarb, nutmeg, and ginger. In addition to its year round product line, 2 Towns makes specialized seasonal varieties and sometimes making use of barrel-aging techniques associated with the making of wine and liquor. 2 Towns products are distributed in 22-ounce bottles, 12-ounce cans, and kegs. The company's total production for 2013 was estimated at 4,500 barrels (140,000 gallons). =Marketing= In 2014 2 Towns Ciderhouse signed on as an official sponsor of the Portland Timbers of Major League Soccer.Bennett Hall, \\"2 Towns Inks Deal with Timbers,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, Feb. 1, 2014.

At Wimbledon in 1956, Arkinstall lost to the eventual semifinalist, American Ham Richardson. In his last appearance at Wimbledon 1957, he lost in the first round in a large defeat against the Brit Mike Davies. He never won the Australian Open Championships or any other Grand Slam tournament. Once he played against Rosewall in his professional career and lost narrowly in the final, fifth set. Arkinstall broke through late into international tennis. In 1950, when he was thirty years old, he played his first international tennis tournament. In 1954 Arkinstall won in the final against the number one player from India Ramanathan Krishnan. He won the Yugoslavian Championships that year against the number one Yugoslav Jaroslav Drobny. In an indoor tournament India Krishnan revenged himself by winning the final against Arkinstall. In 1956 Arkinstall played the Nation Cup for his country - he lost the men's doubles match with Lew Hoad against his Italian opponents Guiseppo Merlo and Orlando Sirola (numbers two). Professional career  In 1958 he played as a professional in his debut at the Wembley Championships in London when he lost the first round of his compatriot Frank Sedgman. The year after Arkinstall played back on Wembley Championships and he again lost against compatriot Ashley Cooper. At the French Pro Championship in 1959 Arkinstall was defeated in the fourth round and repeated that at the tournament in 1960.

In 1962, he competed as a pro in the US Pro Championships reaching the quarterfinal against Earl Buchholz. That was his last year in professional tennis. Retirement  After his active career as a tennis pro was Jack Arkinstall coach of the young Manuel Santana from Spain. He was the number five of Australia in the time he Frank Sedgman (1), Ken McGregor (2), Mervyn Rose (3) and Dinny Pails (4) had, but was higher than his countrymen Geoffrey Brown ('24) Bill Sidwell ('20), Bob Howe ('25) Rex Hartwig ('29), Ian Ayre ('29), George Worthington ('28) and Don Tregonning ('29) before the next generation of Australian tennis players in picture came with, among others, Ken Rosewall.

Later he applied to be official photographer to (Sir) Douglas Mawson's 1911 Australasian Antarctic Expedition.

Ideology Abu al-Majd al-Jolani, commander of Jabhat Ansar al-Islam, stated during an interview on 14 July 2014 that he wanted to establish an Islamic state based on Sharia, and opposed both democracy and a caliphate similar to one proclaimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. History The group was originally formed as Tajamu Ansar al-Islam, or the Gathering of Supporters of Islam, a coalition of several Sunni Islamist groups in Damascus and the Rif Dimashq Governorate, announced on 8 August 2012. The coalition initially consisted of the Habib al-Mustafa Brigade, the Companions Battalions, Brigade of Islam, Criterion Brigade, Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib Battalion, Shield of al- Sham Battalions, and the Damascus branch of the Descendants of the Prophet Brigade. The group took part in the rebel capture of the Marj al-Sultan heliport on 25 November 2012 and the Battle of Daraya, part of the Rif Dimashq offensive (November 2012‚ÄìFebruary 2013). In late 2013, Tajamu Ansar al-Islam fell apart due to differences and disputes between its component groups. On 31 March 2014, Jabhat Ansar al-Islam was formed in the Damascus and Quneitra countryside by the Usama ibn Zayd Brigade, Izz ibn 'Abd al-Salam Brigade, and the Battalion of the Chargers. Some time after its formation, the group established a branch in southern Damascus. On 21 February 2015, the group announced the creation of a branch in the Idlib Governorate in northwestern Syria. On 6 April 2017, clashes erupted between Jabhat Ansar al-Islam and the Syrian Revolutionaries Front in the northern Quneitra countryside, which resulted in 7 rebels being killed. Government forces shelled the area on the same day, which resulted in a ceasefire between the two rebel groups. On 30 May 2018, two commanders of Jabhat Ansar al-Islam, Abu al-Majd al-Jolani and Bashar Abu Shihab, were captured by groups affiliated with the Free Syrian Army in the Quneitra countryside while attempting to surrender to the Syrian Army carrying around $300,000.

The following years this base was situated at Rjukan; Domb√•s; Fagernes Airport, Leirin; and Geilo Airport, Dagali, respectively.Andersen: 139 In 1985 NLA set up a temporary base in Lesja to serve the National Shooting Competition. This spurred a public debate about the issue. A major concern was that from Lesja there was and from Domb√•s to the nearest hospital. Local enthusiasts argued that the long distances were more important than high population density in locating new bases.Andersen: 135 The proposal created a series of demonstrations, especially in Domb√•s. Several local companies donated money towards building a base.Andersen: 137 The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs appointed a commission which in 1986 recommended that a national state-funded helicopter ambulance service be established.

Eight localities were launched, but soon Domb√•s was selected due to its centrality. There was neither time nor funding to build a permanent heliport to begin with, so a temporary facility was erected at the municipal doctor's office.

It is located in 25 de Mayo street and is the oldest non-Catholic church building in Latin America. History The construction started 1830 and was completed in 1831. It is the oldest non-Catholic church building in South America. The church was constructed in record time and in a neo-classical style new to the city after a treaty was signed between Great Britain and Argentina in 1825, granting tolerance for the religion of British subjects resident in the country, and aided by a generous subsidy from the British government. The site, originally the cemetery of the convent of the Mercedarian friars, was donated by the then ruler of Argentina, Juan Manuel de Rosas. From then until the present day and in the midst of numerous civil wars and conflicts, sieges and revolutions, the church has maintained a continuous presence and ministry three blocks from the seat of government, the Casa Rosada. Naturally it has undergone changes to its fabric, including the addition of a chancel in the 19th century to emphasize the importance of the Eucharist and the construction of choirs stalls, canons‚Äô stalls, and bishop‚Äôs throne in the 20th century. An excellent organ was also donated in the Victorian period. With time the walls became adorned with memorials and the windows were filled with stained glass. In 2000 the church was declared a national historical and artistic monument. The Cathedral is the Mother Church of the Diocese of Argentina and it is the place where the Diocesan Bishop and Dean, the Rt. Rev. Gregory J. Venables, has his ‚Äúcathedra‚Äù or seat of honor. The Cathedral serves as a center for diocesan activities, and also it is home to a dynamic Christian community.

It can be embedded into three-dimensional space, with integer coordinates, to form a structure with chiral symmetry. . in which the three edges at each vertex form 120¬∞ angles to each other. It can also be defined more abstractly as a covering graph of the complete graph on four vertices. named this graph after Fritz Laves, who first wrote about it as a crystal structure in 1932... It has also been called the K4 crystal, (10,3)-a network,.. diamond twin, triamond,.. and the srs net.. Constructions =From the integer grid= The regular skew polyhedron onto which the Laves graph can be inscribed As describes, the vertices of the Laves graph can be defined by selecting one out of every eight points in the three- dimensional integer lattice, and forming their nearest neighbor graph. Specifically, one chooses the points :(0,0,0),\\\\quad (1,2,3),\\\\quad (2,3,1),\\\\quad (3,1,2), :(2,2,2),\\\\quad (3,0,1),\\\\quad (0,1,3),\\\\quad (1,3,0), and all the other points that can be formed by adding multiples of four to these coordinates. The edges of the Laves graph connect pairs of points whose Euclidean distance from each other is (these pairs differ by one unit in two coordinates, and are the same in the third coordinate). The other non-adjacent pairs of vertices are farther apart, at a distance of at least from each other. The edges of the resulting geometric graph are diagonals of a subset of the faces of the regular skew polyhedron with six square faces per vertex, so the Laves graph is embedded in this skew polyhedron. It is possible to interleave two copies of the structure, filling one-fourth of the points of the integer lattice, while preserving the fact that the adjacent vertices are exactly the pairs of points that are units apart, and all other pairs of points are farther apart. The two copies are mirror images of each other. =As a covering graph= As an abstract graph, the Laves graph can be constructed as the maximal abelian covering graph of the complete graph K4. Being a covering graph of K4 means that there is a mathematical subgroup of symmetries of the Laves graph such that, when vertices that are symmetric to each other in this subgroup are collected together into orbits of the subgroup, there are four orbits, and each pair of orbits is connected by edges of the graph to each other one. That is, the graph whose vertices are orbits and whose edges are adjacent pairs of orbits is exactly K4. Being an abelian covering graph means that this subgroup of symmetries is an abelian group (in this case, the group \\\\mathbb{Z}^3 formed by addition of three-dimensional integer vectors), and being a maximal abelian covering graph means that there is no other covering graph of K4 involving a higher-dimensional abelian group. This construction justifies one of the alternative names of the Laves graph, the K4 crystal. One way to construct a maximal abelian covering graph from a smaller graph G (in this case K4) is to choose a spanning tree of G, let d be the number of edges that are not in the spanning tree (in this case, three non-tree edges), and to choose a distinct unit vector in \\\\mathbb{Z}^d for each of these non-tree edges. Then, fix the set of vertices of the covering graph to be the ordered pairs (v,w) where v is a vertex of G and w is a vector in \\\\mathbb{Z}^d. For each such pair, and each edge uv adjacent to v in G, make an edge from (v,w) to (u,w ¬± Œµ) where Œµ is zero if uv belongs to the spanning tree and is otherwise the basis vector associated with uv, and where the plus or minus sign is chosen according to the direction the edge is traversed. The resulting graph is independent of the choice of the spanning tree, and the same construction can also be interpreted more abstractly using the theory of homology.. Using the same construction, the hexagonal tiling of the plane is the maximal abelian covering graph of the three-edge dipole graph, and the diamond cubic is the maximal abelian covering graph of the four-edge dipole. The d-dimensional integer lattice (with unit length edges) is the maximal abelian covering graph of a graph with one vertex and d self-loops. Properties The Laves graph is a cubic graph (there are exactly three edges at each vertex) and a symmetric graph (every incident pair of a vertex and an edge can be transformed into every other such pair by a symmetry of the graph). The girth of this structure is 10 ‚Äî the shortest cycles in the graph have 10 vertices ‚Äî and 15 of these cycles pass through each vertex. The cells of the Voronoi diagram of this structure are heptadecahedra with 17 faces each. They are plesiohedra, polyhedra that tile space isohedrally. Experimenting with the structures formed by these polyhedra led Alan Schoen to discover the gyroid minimal surface.. One of the four cubic induced subgraphs of the unit distance graph on the three-dimensional integer lattice having a girth of 10 is isomorphic to the Laves graph.. Physical examples =Molecular crystals= Computations suggest that the Laves graph can serve as the pattern for a metastable or perhaps unstable allotrope of carbon... Like graphite, each atom in the structure is bonded to three others, but in graphite adjacent atoms have the same bonding planes as each other whereas in this structure the bonding planes of adjacent atoms are twisted with respect to each other around the line formed by the bond, with a twisting angle of approximately 70.5¬∞. The Laves graph may also give a crystal structure for boron; computations predict that this should be stable. Other chemicals that may form this structure include SrSi2, and elemental nitrogen.. =Other= The structure of the Laves graph, and of gyroid surfaces derived from it, has also been observed experimentally in soap-water systems, and in the chitin networks of butterfly wing scales.

He started off as a janitor and became one of the most serious African American writers of his time. Through his contributions and efforts in the Watts Writers‚Äô Workshop he raised awareness in the United States' racial conflict during the 1960s. Early life and education Harry Dolan was born in Pittsburgh and attended Pittsburgh High and Carnegie Tech. Studying to be an architect, he failed because he \\"couldn't make those curvatures,\\" he said once. During his seven years in the Coast Guard that followed, he had ample time to satisfy his appetite for reading books and \\"all kinds of writing.\\" After his discharge, he worked as fiction editor of The Boston Sun. Leaving the East for California with his family in 1962, he found a position as a janitor at the Los Angeles City Hall, another job that left his mind free for reading and writing. He was attending Los Angeles Harbor College when the Watts riots erupted in 1965. A reference to Budd Schulberg's Watts Writers Workshop in Jet magazine prompted him to join the workshop. Watts Writers Workshop \\"The Workshop participants had one thing in common: a desire to write‚Äîpoetry, essay, and stories based on life experiences. Often their writings laid bare ‚Äòthe angers, fears, frustrations‚Äô of the people living in Watts\\". In 1966 Harry Dolan, along with Schulberg and Johnie Scott, testified before \\"the Ribicoff Committee of the United States Congress, which was investigating urban dislocation and the problems of African Americans living in American cities\\". This was just one of the redefining opportunities that the Workshop created for themselves that year. \\"The individual words of the writers in the Workshop changed the perception of post-1965 Watts from the National Guard‚Äîstudded streets to an active arena of spiritual and cultural struggle\\". In his \\"short prose piece,\\" Will There Be Another Riot in Watts? Dolan's writing style gave a voice to the topic of \\"cultural blindness toward 'injustice'\\". The author drew \\"attention to the severity of the issue,\\" and ultimately, \\"achieved a forum\\". =Rise and success= As the success of the Workshop rose, it \\"drew the attention of the Los Angeles press\\". In result, \\"NBC TV devoted an hour of prime time to present 'The Angry Voices of Watts‚Äô on August 16, 1966'\\". Among many of the talented Watts writers, Harry Dolan made a name for himself with his playwrights, specifically his teleplay Losers and Weepers. The play was first written for Mystery Digest containing a storyline of all white characters \\"about a poor family, where the young boy decided to go for the money. At the time the emphasis was on the missing money‚Äîthat was the magazines interest\\". After critiquing his work to fit the Workshop's intention of giving African Americans a chance to voice their concerns, the plot of ‚ÄúLosers and Weepers‚Äù changed, this time depicting the \\"frustrations and impotence of a Negro family's life in an urban ghetto\\". The play shined light on the \\"oppressive, destructive possibilities of the Negro slum matriarchy\\". In February 1967, Losers and Weepers was broadcast on national television as the first episode of NBC Experiment in Television. Losers and Weepers was just the start to Dolan's success. Shortly after the play became a hit he was \\"signed by Warner Bros. Seven Arts to adapt the Broadway show 'No Strings' to the screen\\". In 1970, Dolan and writer/singer Dee Dee McNeal produced Dolan's play The Iron Hand of Nat Turner. \\"The play recounted the story of an 1831 Virginia slave rebellion from the point of view of its leader, preacher, and slave, Nat Turner\\". Not only did Dolan do his duty as a husband and father by looking after his wife and six children, but he also was deeply involved in the Watts writers' personal lives. He created leaders out of \\"men and women trying to make their way in the community as artists\\". Through his mentoring, he molded Workshop writers such as Amde and Otis, making them capable of earning promotions as he \\"eventually made Amde assistant director, and asked Otis to take over as the poetry and creative writing instructor\\".

The Sack of Campeche was a 1663 raid by pirates led by Christopher Myngs and Edward Mansvelt which became a model for later coastal pirate raids of the buccaneering era. Background Having successfully raided Santiago de Cuba in 1662, Myngs announced that his next target would be the heavily fortified coastal town, Campeche, in what is now southern Mexico. Pirate captains from across the Caribbean volunteered their services, and Myngs amassed the largest pirate fleet ever seen with 14 ships and 1400 pirates. The primarily English fleet was subsequently joined by four French ships and three Dutch privateer ships for a total of more than 20 vessels. Leading the fleet was Myngs' flagship HMS Centurion and the smaller vice-flagship the Griffin. The fleet included already-well-known pirates Mansvelt, Henry Morgan and Abraham Blauvelt. It is likely it included other younger sailors who would later captain pirate vessels of their own and replicate Myngs' tactics. They left Port Royal in January, joined by other smaller vessels as they went but losing contact with the Griffin. The raid Early the following month, the fleet arrived in Campeche Bay. By night, Myngs landed approximately 1000 men a short distance from the city on 8 February. The following morning, Spanish lookouts saw the fleet's smaller ships at first light and sought to raise the alarm, though unaware that Myngs' much larger 40-gun flagship lay just out of sight. Regardless, the warning came too late and the pirates attacked at approximately 8:00 am. The pirates initially struggled against the city's 150-strong militia who used high ground of flat-roofed stone houses to their advantage. Fighting was fierce and Myngs was injured. He was returned to his ship leaving Mansvelt in charge. After a 2-hour-long battle, 50 Spanish defenders and 30 English, Dutch and French pirates were dead. The sole surviving Spanish official agreed to terms of surrender and the pirates sacked the city, taking an additional 14 vessels from the harbour when they left 2 weeks later. The pirates plundered a total of 150,000 Spanish pieces of eight. Aftermath The defeat of Campeche's defences was so comprehensive and the subsequent outrage so strong that King Charles was forced to forbid further similar raids. That policy was enforced across the Caribbean for the remainder of the term of Governor Thomas Modyford. When he died in 1679, similar raids were organised including the attack on Veracruz in 1683 and the raid on Cartagena later that same year. Both plans involved landing a large ground- based force to attack a fortified settlement which otherwise might have been able to defend itself against a seaborne raid. Myngs returned to England the following year to recover from his injuries.

Castro also affiliated with the Workers' Revolutionary Party, an early left-wing political party; he sat on its Political State Committee between 1980 and 1984 and on its national central committee between 1986 and 1989. By 1999, Castro had changed his party affiliation to the Party of the Democratic Revolution, and when it came into power, Castro left teaching to head up a middle school in Baja California Sur. In 2002, he was named the state secretary of public education, a post he would hold for two years. In 2005, he ran successfully for municipal president of La Paz, serving simultaneously on the PRD's state council.

It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Rubra. History and classification Acer taurocursum is represented by a solitary fossil specimen from the northeasternmost part of Nevada. The specimen was described by Jack A. Wolfe and Toshimasa Tanai from the \\"Bull Run\\" flora UCMP location P562, which was preserved in lacustrine sedimentation associated with extensive intermittent volcanism between . Radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash above and below the flora reported in 1966 indicated an age of approximately . The Bull Run flora, Copper Basin flora, and Elko flora were formed in the same time frame as a result of the activity. These three floras were possibly tied to the Salmon and Cow Creek floras of Central Idaho, and possibly with the John Day Formations Sheep rock flora in Oregon. Acer taurocursum is one of six Acer species to be described by Wolfe and Tanai in 1987 from the \\"Bull Run\\" flora, with the others being A. elkoanum, A. eonegundo, A. cadaver, A. eomediunum, and A. axelrodi. Like A. taurocursum, A. cadaver is described from fruits. Acer axelrodi, A. elkoanum, and Acer eomediunum are known from both leaves and fruits, while A. eonegundo is only described form foliage. Wolfe and Tanai noted that A. taurocursum is the oldest record of the Acer section Eriocarpa. That section is now considered part of Acer section Rubra.Flora of the Carolinas, Virginia, and Georgia The holotype for Acer taurocursum is a part specimen numbered UCMP 9089, which at the time of description was preserved in the University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, California. The specimen was studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. taurocursum in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name taurocursum is in recognition of the type location for the species in the Bull Run flora of Nevada. Description The general shape of the A. taurocursum nutlet is narrow and elliptic, moderately inflated, and it has a rounded tip end. The nutlet is wide and in length. The overall length of the samara is approximately and a wing width of , which is placed almost entirely behind the nutlet. The paired samaras of the species have a 20¬∞ attachment angle. The wing venation is formed by approximately twenty veins that merge along the upper margin of the wing before acutely dichotomizing and anastomosing in the wing membrane. The shape of the nutlet suggested to Wolfe and Tanai placement into Acer section Eriocarpa.

In this episode, Belle and the fairies work on an antidote; Emma and Elsa search for Anna; and in Arendelle, Anna and Kristoff learn that 30 years have passed. Plot =Opening sequence= In the forest, snow falls over Elsa and Anna's parents' ship at the bottom of the sea. Gerda's message to her daughters lies on the ocean floor. =Event chronology= The Arendelle events take place more than thirty years after \\"Smash the Mirror\\", and before \\"Heroes and Villains\\". The Enchanted Forest events take place concurrently with the events in Storybrooke, after the scene with Ariel and Prince Eric on Hangman's Island in \\"The Jolly Roger\\" and before \\"The Dark Swan\\". The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Smash the Mirror\\". =In Arendelle and at sea= Anna (Elizabeth Lail) and Kristoff (Scott Michael Foster) are trying to find Elsa when Hans (Tyler Jacob Moore) and his brothers arrive to imprison them for treason. Anna and Kristoff escape and decide to go to the pirate Blackbeard (Charles Mesure), to look for the wishing star which they can use to free Elsa, who is trapped in a magic urn. They tell Blackbeard that they will pay for the wishing star with his weight in gold, but Hans and his brothers suddenly appear and tell Anna and Kristoff that this a set-up. Hans then says that Arendelle has been frozen for 30 years, which surprises Anna and Kristoff. As they worry about what may have happened to Elsa and what the Snow Queen has done since then, they are put in a trunk, which is then locked and dumped into the sea by Hans and Blackbeard so Hans and his brothers can take over Arendelle. Anna and Kristoff try to escape the trunk as it fills with water, and Anna starts reciting her marriage vows because she wants to be married before she dies. Kristoff stops her, saying that he will only marry her after they escape. As the trunk is almost completely filled with water, they are suddenly brought to the beach in Storybrooke because Elsa wished for Anna. =In Storybrooke= Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) approaches Ingrid (Elizabeth Mitchell) and asks that Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) are spared from the Spell of Shattered Sight, so that he can leave town with them. She agrees to this proposal. Meanwhile, others in Storybrooke try to figure out how to escape the Spell of Shattered Sight. Emma (Jennifer Morrison) suggests they leave town, but the ice wall is blocking every way out and when David tries to cut it down, new ice structures emerge to block his effort. However, a crack appears in the ice, which reveals Anna's necklace, and Elsa retrieves it. Belle and the fairies try to come up with a counter spell to reverse the curse effect. They can make one with either Anna's hair or her necklace, because she is now immune to the curse, as Ingrid had already cast the same curse over her. Elsa (Georgina Haig) takes her sister's necklace and attempts to find Anna using a locator spell, but it leads her and Emma to a solid wall in the tunnels under the library. Emma convinces Elsa that it is too risky to blast through. After making it back to the library, at the constant urging of Regina, and eventually Mary Margaret, Emma explains to Elsa that she needs to think about saving more lives than just Anna's. Elsa finally hands over the bag containing the necklace, but when Mother Superior opens it, it is revealed that Elsa has swapped out the necklace for rocks and has gone to find Anna on her own. Gold orders Hook (Colin O'Donoghue) to stop the fairies and take their magic with the Sorcerer's Hat, so he can gain the power to free himself from the Dagger. Hook reluctantly does so, and captures all of the fairies. Gold then takes Belle to his shop and locks her in for her own protection. Emma has decided to help Elsa search for Anna. The necklace leads them to the beach, but Anna is not there. Emma explains that magic is not always accurate, and that she needs to accept that Anna may no longer even be alive. Elsa weeps and wishes that she could know what happened to Anna and that she could see her again. Suddenly the necklace begins to glow. The necklace is revealed to be the Wishing Star. A water-filled trunk appears in the water and Anna and Kristoff emerge as Gerda's message in the bottle for her daughters appears ashore on the beach, but goes unnoticed. After a brief reunion, they run to Granny's to take Anna's hair to finish the counter spell, but find no one there, since Hook has captured the fairies. The four head to the sheriff's office, where they find Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), David (Josh Dallas), and Neal. Mary Margaret hands Emma the keys to the jail, and says to lock her and David in separate cells, as they don't want to hurt themselves or anyone else when Ingrid's curse takes effect. Emma reluctantly does so, and takes her baby brother to protect him. Hook comes in, stating that he had to see Emma one last time and the two tearfully kiss goodbye, before Hook leaves to chain himself to a dock at the marina. In the mayor's office, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Henry to stay in her office and to not let anyone in or out. She seals the door to her office and runs into Robin (Sean Maguire), who pleads he is not afraid of her and wants to stay by her side. She replies that no one will be safe when this spell hits, then runs to her vault and seals herself in. The spell falls upon the town, an indigo thunderstorm covers the town, and mirror shards begin to rain down from the sky as Hook looks on from the docks. Mary Margaret's and David's eyes frost over and \\"crack,\\" and they let go of each other's hands and begin looking menacingly at each other. Reception The episode received mixed to positive reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a positive review, rating it 4.8 out of 5. She said, \\"It was quite a relief to see Anna and Elsa finally reunited and the necklace being the wishing star was a fun twist. Unfortunately, getting Anna to Storybrooke proved to be too little too late.\\" Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a moderate review, saying the episode \\"delivered on the Frozen storyline front and brought the reunion we've been dying to see, but some scenes seemed created to fill time. They stretched to make connections with Blackbeard and spent too much energy trying to make Hans seem dangerous. However, characters such as Regina and Snow White had some nice dialogue and development. It would be a pleasant change to see the story turns back towards them instead of the villain of the moment.\\" Ratcliffe gave the episode a 6.7 rating out of 10.

The story centers on 16-year-old Monica Reeves, who is running for Prom Queen at her high school. One day, she wakes up with crazy hair after combining loads of different products. But Monica soon has bigger things to worry about when ex-police Lieutenant Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Morgan arrives at Monica‚Äôs door in search of a $7 million diamond necklace. The two become unlikely friends as they race to fix Monica‚Äôs hair for prom and protect the necklace from falling into the hands of a world-renewed jewel thief, Pierce Peters. Plot Monica, a high school tech whiz, is determined to become prom queen and is planning to go to MIT or a state university. She prepares herself the day before prom so she can save time when it comes, and thinks nothing will go wrong. On the big day, however, she wakes up with a bad hair day, and everything that can go wrong does: Her prom dress is destroyed, and her shoes break. Monica answers the door to a woman claiming to be an FBI agent. The woman, Liz, seeks a necklace that Monica purchased at an antique shop, wanting to recover it and get her job back. In verifying Liz's credentials, Monica discovers that Liz is not actually an FBI agent but a private investigator. Monica smartly deduces Liz's claim, and she coaxes Liz into giving her a ride around town to fix her hair, replace her outfit, and take her to get driving lessons in exchange for the necklace. Prom day goes from bad to worse as the pair is pursued by Pierce Peters, an intelligent British jewel thief who is also pursuing the diamond to give it to a buyer. Meanwhile, Monica finds that she cannot get an appointment to fix her hair or replace her dress and shoes. Furthermore, her supposed boyfriend Kyle has been cheating on her with her school rival, Ashley, who is also running for prom queen. After Liz tries to retaliate by scaring Monica's boyfriend with an arrest on trumped-up charges, Liz gets arrested and Monica learns that Liz is a suspended police officer who has been scolded by the police chief from her department after her previous failures in catching Pierce. While Liz is being scolded, Monica meets her former partner, Ed. Afterward, Liz confesses that the necklace had a priceless diamond that was on display at a museum that was stolen by Peters, a crime she felt guilty for allowing to take place, as she believed that she could handle it without calling for backup. The diamond was on the verge of being sold to a shady buyer wearing \\"the safari look,\\" but was passed along to someone else by mistake with a similar look and subsequently lost in various exchanges. When the time comes to take her driving lesson, Monica talks the instructor and Liz into letting them use her car, named Brando, when suddenly they encounter Pierce and are taken on a wild ride throughout the city. After Monica fails her driving lesson and Liz gets her car towed away, they argue over their predicament, splitting the two of them up. Pierce makes a phone call to Monica, informing her that he kidnapped her father. Monica and Liz work together to get the car back. Arriving at Pierce's hideout, Liz states that she can't transfer to another police station to get away from the police chief because the police chief is her mother. Monica and Liz are lured into a trap by Pierce, but they outsmart him. After being tasered by Liz, Pierce is arrested by the police Liz calls for backup. In the end, Liz is reinstated on the force by her mother. Liz then sorts out Monica's hair and clothes. Monica and Liz go to the prom (with a full police procession), where Monica is told that she has been voted prom queen after her ex-boyfriend's infidelity went viral. Monica tells the crowd that being perfect is overrated, and all enjoy the night. She also decides to go to MIT.

In an interview with Variety, Baker said, \\"I wanted to executive produce because I wanted to see what it was like to build and fulfill a vision from the ground up, and since this was Disney Channel's first movie with an adult lead, I wanted that role to be protected and I wanted the movie to have my creative stamp on it.\\" She also liked that she got to work on the Disney movie because it taps into her family unit fanbase. Marano also mentioned that it was her first DCOM. Filming took place in Montreal, standing in for an unnamed American city. Marano noted that in contrast to Austin & Ally which had four cameras and shot about ten scenes a day, the film shot with fewer cameras and fewer scenes, one of which took the entire day. Marano said that she likes that her character embodies two normally contrasting high school cliches ‚Äì a prom queen nominee who likes beauty and fashion and is popular, and a computer whiz who has a nerdy tech obsession and codes. She also likes that she relates with her character when deciding whether to go to the state college or MIT. The film's soundtrack was composed by Michael Corriveau. He mixed over 60 minutes of music with Sylvain Lefebvre of Lamajeure. According to the Lamajeure website, the soundtrack used pop, rhythmic and classical music. Corriveau worked with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Prague, and the recording was done at the Dvorak Hall at the Rudolfinum. The feature song is \\"For the Ride\\" by Laura Marano. The song used in the trailer was \\"Nuthin'\\" by Lecrae. Other songs include: \\"Rooftop\\" by Skylar Stecker, \\"Colorful World\\" by Shayna Rose, \\"All Over The World\\" by The Fooo Conspiracy, \\"Happy Place\\" feat. Hanna Ashbook by Oh, Hush!, and \\"Heatroc\\" feat. Lazarus by Agzilla. Broadcast The film was first released on February 6, 2015 on WATCH Disney Channel, and had its premiere broadcast in the US on February 13. It premiered in Canada on the Family Channel on March 20, and in Australia on April 17. Reception Bad Hair Day delivered 4.0 million viewers for its television premiere and has had 435,000 views on the WATCH Disney Channel app since it was released on February 6. Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter found the duo of Baker and Marano \\"played well off each other\\", and that Marano's character was \\"refreshingly age-appropriate\\". She found the movie to be goofy but not slapsticky, and that it was \\"like a junior version of Thelma and Louise albeit with a much, much happier ending.\\" References External links * Bad Hair Day at Muse Entertainment * Category:2010s teen comedy films Category:2015 television films Category:American films Category:American teen comedy films Category:Disney Channel Original Movie films Category:Films shot in Montreal Category:Films directed by Eric Canuel ","title":"Bad Hair Day (film)"},{"id":"44557629","text":"The James Cook University Law Review is an annual peer-reviewed law journal published by the James Cook University School of Law.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Miscellany 14 The epithet, rigida, is in regard to its stiff thallus branches. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia rigida is classified in the subgenus Vermilacina in which it is distinguished by the thallus divided into short rigid erect branches blackened to about ¬º the way up from the base. The branches are strongly compressed, resembling short grass-like blades, 0.5 to 2 cm high and 1‚Äì4 mm wide. Lichen substances are primarily the diterpene (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane, with trace amounts of zeorin, or zeorin lacking, and two other unknowns, one of which is referred to as the T4 compound that is found in V. combeoides and V. pumila. The other unknown was not reported in any other species. The T3 compound, bourgeanic acid, and salazinic acid, which commonly occur in species of the subgenus Vermilacinia, were also not reported. Vermilacinia rigida‚Äîeasily recognized at a glance‚Äîis most similar in morphology to V. laevigata, a species that is twice its size and often less definite in its shape of the branches, irregularly widened in areas to as much as 3.5 cm across. Both species have a relatively smooth cortical surface, but the cortex is generally twice as thick in V. laevigata, 100‚Äì175 ¬µm thick, compared to 40‚Äì95 ¬µm thick in V. rigida. Vermilacinia laevigata also differs in its chemistry, lichen substances include the T3 compound, bourgeanic acid, and zeorin that are consistently present. Taxonomic History Vermilacinia rigida was discovered by Richard Spjut, accompanied by Richard Marin and Thomas McCloud, on 19 May 1986 just south of Punta Negra on rock outcrops on a ridge that appeared to have received more precipitation from ocean fog than other nearby areas (Plate 1D in Spjut‚Äôs 1996 revision of Niebla and Vermilacinia). This particular ridge was observed during May 1985 by Spjut‚Äîwhile he and Marin were collecting samples of lichens in search of new drugs to treat HIV‚Äîto have fog lingering around the peaks most of the day). The following year, in May 1986, a special effort was made to find a path to the ridges and peaks. In addition to V. rigida, other rare new species of lichens were discovered, Niebla infundibula and N. homaleoides, the latter was also found with V. rigida on Punta Cono, 15 April 1990. Peter Bowler and Janet Marsh included Vermilacinia rigida, among four other species of Vermilacinia with a flattened branch type of morphology (V. johncassadyi V. ligulata, V. rosei, V. varicosa), and one with cylindrical branch type (V. paleoderma), under their Niebla laevigata (= Vermilacinia laevigata). No explanation was provided as to why they considered all these species the same as V. laevigata, especially since they also recognized many species with cylindrical branch types (V. cedrosensis, V. combeoides, V. robusta, V. procera), all of which were named by Bowler and collaborators in Niebla.Bowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. \\"Niebla\\". ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2: 368‚Äì380 This was in contrast to all Spjut‚Äôs species described to have a flattened blade morphology that were rejected by Bowler. While Spjut accepted Bowler‚Äôs species, even though he had also independently had recognized many of them (Niebla isidiaescens, V. ceruchoides, V. laevigata, V. procera), not a single species described by Spjut was accepted by Bowler and Marsh. The genus Vermilacinia differs from Niebla in the absence of chondroid strands, by not having cortical ridges define branch margins, and by producing terpenes and bourgeanic acid not found in NieblaSpjut R.

Garita has a post office with ZIP code 88421, which opened on January 19, 1907; the post office used the name Variadero intermittently until the 1920s. The community's two names both come from Spanish terms; Variadero derives from variar, meaning \\"to change\\", due to the changes in the river's course, while Garita means \\"lookout\\" or \\"government building\\". Variadero was initially called \\"Estrada\\" after the first settler, Jose Laureano Estrada, who made a permanent home along the Conchas Arroyo around the time of the Civil War. Jose Laureano is buried at the Catholic Cemetery across highway 104 from the Catholic Church in Variadero. His wife Filomena Estrada de Madrid is buried at his side.

Garita, however, was the name given to the huge square blocks of sandstone about eight miles southeast of Variadero along highway 104 which reminded early settlers of a garita which is \\"sentry post\\" in Spanish. A small arroyo about a quarter mile northwest of the garita was named the Garita Creek. Later settlers made homes to the west, along the Garita Creek and a small community in that area was known as Garita.

It denoted 60 pieces or 5 dozens of whatever was counted. It was used for counting large amounts of money (particularly Prague groschens). For example, ransoms and war reparations after the Battle of Grunwald were counted in kopas of Prague groschen; the 16th-century treasury of the Grand Duchy was counted in kopas of Lithuanian groschens. Kopa was also used to count grain sheaves or quantities of other products (for example, nails, eggs, cabbages). Kopa's original meaning was the number of Prague groschens that could be minted from a grzywna of silver. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that number was 60. In Poland, during the reign of Casimir the Great (1333‚Äì1370), the weight of grzywna was reduced by about 20%. That meant that in Poland kopa was equal to 48. In the 15th century, Poland adopted the Lithuanian definition that a kopa is equal to 60. Germans had a similar unit, Schock, to count Meissen groschen minted by Frederick II, Elector of Saxony and William III, Landgrave of Thuringia. The unit was officially abolished by the Russian Empire in 1825, but survived in everyday use until the early 20th century. The term is often incorrectly applied to Lithuanian long coins as earlier researchers believed that the word kopa was derived from Lithuanian kapoti (to chop). However, that is likely an example of folk etymology. The actual etymology is not fully understood.

Distinguishing features Vermilainia robusta is classified in the subgenus Vermilacinia in which it is easily recognized by its relatively small number basal tubular branches, generally 5‚Äì10 in number, often inflated and connected to a basal holdfast. Deflated forms can be difficult to distinguish from other related species, but generally recognized by the simple branches that are relatively broad to their short length, not more than 4 cm long, up to 6 mm in diameter.

It existed between 1987 and 1998.  History  = Origins and foundation (1983-1990) = The Party of the South originated in the Southern Socialist Democratic Movement (also known as \\"South Wind\\"), founded in Valdivia on September 3, 1983 by Carlos Podlech, then president of the National Association of Wheat Growers. It was mainly composed of former militants of the National Party and was defined as a regionalist and environmental movement. The political party was founded by Eduardo D√≠az Herrera in 1987, presenting the charter before the Chilean Electoral Service on April 21 of that year. The state agency filed objections to such deed six days after being given the final document on May 11. It was officially declared as \\"forming party\\" on May 23, 1987, which had a period of 210 days to register the minimum number of members. This goal was not achieved, and registration was expired on December 23, 1987. Five days later, the party started again the procedures for legal registration, achieving this objective on June 1, 1988. In 1988 it supported the \\"Yes\\" in the plebiscite that defined the continuity of Augusto Pinochet as President of Chile. However, the \\"No\\" option was winning in that contest. The following year he called to vote \\"No\\" in the referendum for constitutional reforms. = Merger with the Liberal Party (1990-1994) = The party supported the candidacy of Francisco Javier Err√°zuriz Talavera for the presidency of the Republic of Chile in 1989. Meanwhile, the Party of the South competed in the parliamentary election with an own list, but did not select a congressman or senator. Proceeds from this and to get less than 5% of the vote in the regions where it was registered, Party of the South should be dissolved by the Electoral Service on 17 July 1990. However, this was prevented by merging with the Liberal Party, adopting the name of the latter. In 1992, this party competed in the municipal elections of that year, representing the Participation and Progress pact, but the party supported only independent candidates, because it was not legally constituted under his name (the Party of the South members at that time were part of the Liberal Party after its merger in 1990). On March 5, 1993 the Liberal Party renamed, so again be referred to as \\"Party of the South\\". That same year, in the presidential election, supported the candidacy of Arturo Alessandri Besa, while in the parliamentary election it was part of the Union for the Progress of Chile, carrying only one candidate for senator and one single candidate for deputy. However, the party had no representation in Congress, but later broke relations as well as with National Renewal and the Independent Democratic Union. Because it did not obtained the minimum percentage of votes required by law, the party was dissolved on June 8, 1994. = Reenrollment (1994-1998) = The party started again the process to be enrolled under its original name on July 11, 1994, being declared as \\"forming party\\" on October 8. By a judgment of the Electoral Service, the Party of the South was registered again as a legal political party on August 21, 1995. The party was initially enrolled in the regions of Araucan√≠a, Los Lagos and Ays√©n, all of southern Chile, returning to its regionalist essence.http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=33888 In 1996, it returned to compete with an own list, this time in the municipal election of that year, under the name of \\"Independent South\\", winning two mayors (Eduardo D√≠az Herrera in Tolt√©n and Walter van Haidorp Montero in Saavedra) and seven councilors. Finally, in 1997, the party was integrated into the Union for Chile, to compete in the parliamentary election of that year, with one candidate for deputy (Eduardo D√≠az del R√≠o, in 51st district), who was elected. This was the end of the Party of the South, since getting a percentage lower than the minimum to subsist as a political party in that election, according to Law No. 18.603 (relating to political parties), caused its dissolution on June 23, 1998, so that most of its members went to the Independent Democratic Union.

It was the only Syrian rebel group to be completely under the authority of a local city council and received U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missiles despite the tight siege Darayya was in between 2012 and 2016. Military structure Between 2013 and 2016, the highest level of command for the group was the Local Council of Daraya City. The group is commanded by Saeed Narqash (nom de guerre Abu Jamal), a captain who defected from the Syrian Army. The group's initial chief of staff was First Lieutenant Abu Shahin, who left the group to form another in June 2013, while its commander of operations was First Warrant Officer Abu Omar. A military academy was established in Daraya when it was controlled by the group. History =Siege of Daraya= The Martyrs of Islam Brigade was formed on 5 March 2013 as a merger of 9 rebel units affiliated with the Free Syrian Army in Daraya. On 14 February 2014, the group signed a convention which established the Southern Front. As part of the Southern Front's declaration of principles which the Martyrs of Islam Brigade was a signatory member of, the groups pledged to overthrow the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad and fight for human rights in Syria in accordance with the International Bill of Human Rights. Since August 2015, more than 120 rebels were killed in Daraya, and by July 2016, less than 1,000 rebels from the Martyrs of Islam Brigade and the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union remained in the suburb. =Post-Daraya= Capt. Saeed Narqash in the Idlib Governorate, September 2016 In September 2016, after 4 years of siege in Daraya and an agreement with the Syrian Armed Forces, all the remaining 700 fighters from the Martyrs of Islam Brigade evacuated from Daraya to the Idlib Governorate to the north. Since then, its commander, Capt. Saeed Narqash, denounced the Southern Front and cut all links with it, with sources stating that the group is planning to join Jaysh al- Islam instead. The commander denied this and emphasized that the it will become an independent faction. Immediately after the group's arrival in Idlib, some of its \\"best fighters\\" were captured by al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front. They were eventually released, and the group gradually disintegrated. Capt. Narqash briefly participated in the Astana talks in January 2017, but soon withdrew. In March 2017, the group participated in the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)-led Hama offensive. On 24 April 2018, Saeed Narqash was captured by unidentified assailants in the town of Sarmada. The Martyrs of Islam Brigade accused Tahrir al-Sham fighters of raiding Narqash's house, but Abu Ayman al-Shami, security official of HTS, denied involvement and stated that HTS was not notified of the incident. On 26 May, Narqash's captors released a video showing him being handcuffed and held in an unknown location, where he was forced to explain his participation in the Astana talks, and claimed that Turkish and US intelligence requested him to join the fight against HTS. HTS again denied involvement. In May 2018, along with 10 other rebel groups in northwestern Syria, the Martyrs of Islam Brigade formed the National Front for Liberation, which was officially announced on 28 May. On 5 June, the group joined the Sham Legion, also part of the National Front for Liberation.

Its origin can be traced back to a tragic story centred on King Kumara Dharmasena or Kumaradhatusena son of King Kasyapa of Sigiriya (512-522 AD) and his closet friend, Kalidasa, a famous dramatist and poet. According to the tale the king whilst in the amorous company of a courtesan, spied a bee entangled in the petals of a lotus flower, inspired he wrote two poetic lines. He then offered a reward to anybody who could complete the other two stanzas to his poem. The cunning courtesan seized the opportunity took the verse to Kalidasa, who completed the poem. The courtesan then murdered Kalidasa in order to keep the reward for herself, concealing the body. The king however instantly recognised his friend's handwriting bringing the whole murderous ruse to light. When Kalidasa's dead body was taken to the funeral pyre for cremation, the grieving king unable to control his grief over the death of his beloved friend, threw himself into the burning flames and immolated himself. Upon witnessed this tragedy, five official queens also leapt into the flames to their deaths. Local legend has it that seven Bo trees were planted over the seven tombs. These seven Bo trees are known locally as the \\"Hath Bodhis\\" and are said to be still surviving at six different places around Matara. Matara Bodhiya is one of those trees. It is respected and protected by the local buddhists. In 1783 when the Dutch ruled Matara, a Dutch General is alleged to have cut down those seven Bo trees and had used their timber for the construction of local buildings, with only one having survived. Developing progress While the British controlled the country they attempted to destroy this sacred tree but were thwarted by local buddhists, who protected the tree with their lives. The people who led the protection of the tree were merchants, police and buddhist officers on the urban council. A procession was organised from Kotuwegoda to bring a statue of Buddha, led by Daniel Abeysuriya, a local lawyer, who was also the vice president of Sinhala Maha Sabha. They placed the statue in front of the sacred tree and also supplied electricity with the help of other local buddhists. B. Ariyaratne, B. A. Siman Appuhami and K. P. Karanelis, who are the members of Bodhi Arakshaka Sabha, have committed to protect the Matara Bodhiya. In 1961 K. T. Somapala, C. A. Dharmasena and R. P. Pelis commenced the construction of a Stupa at the site.

DSIL is Thailand‚Äôs first school that follows the Constructionism Theory as the school curriculum. DSIL was founded in 1997 and has a variety of connections to educational institutions, such as Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), etc. to keep the school innovative and moving forward.  History  Darunsikkhalai School for Innovative Learning was founded by Mr. Paron Isarasena Na- Ayuthaya in 1997 he was the director of the Lighthouse Project (Education development project in Thailand created by the Suksaphat Foundation). and a member of King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi Board of Committee. He brought the concept of Constructionism from Professor Seymour Papert of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) The developer of Constructionism Theory into Darunsikkhalai school curriculum. The actual curriculum used currently were developed from both the Constructionism and Constructivism theories of Seymour Papert and Jean Piaget. Both theories introduce learners to cognitive and learning sciences combined with physiology and used in the school for basic learning.  Constructionism in school  It started on the project called ‚ÄúEpistemological theory of constructivism‚Äù of Jean Piaget. When Seymour Papert was corroborating with Jean on his project. The theory is that individual learners construct mental models to understand the world around them. Seymour gave definition of Constructionism on titled Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education that \\"The word constructionism is a mnemonic for two aspects of the theory of science education underlying this project. From constructivist theories of psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing is a meaningful product.‚Äù . In this way of learning learner will learn from real life objects which learners can study the topic by both using technology or not using the technology. They can learn project from creating multimedia presentation such as writing a book, creating invention or even drawing art work, etc. In this way it helps student to find themselves that which way of doing things and present it will best suitable for them. Inside Constructionism Theory separated into two important subjects which are 1.Project-based learning and 2.Problem-based learning. = Project- based learning = Project-based learning which allows students to think of a project that they‚Äôre interested in then make research and summary it into a report and present them to audiences. In this way it helps student to think creatively and know the process of creating something. In overall Constructionism Theory, allow learners to learn more deeper and learn how to be a better learner. = Problem-based learning = Problem-based learning allow learners to utilize the problem as question that they suffer to solve and think that which solution is the most efficient solution for that problem. In this process it makes student learn how to solve a problem so in the future they will have a head fills with ways to solve any complicated questions.  Levels in school  Darunsikkhalai School separates levels of students by their capability, not their ages, because it is believed that students cannot be judged by their ages, but they should be judged by their knowledge and the level of development of their brain each levels has different of requirements so higher will have more requirements, and details of work have to be more advanced. Three levels are: = New Learner = New Learner ‚Äì new students are required to be in this level because they need to learn all of the basis of constructionism theory that applied in school curriculum.  FabLab @ School, Bangkok  Recently Darunsikkhalai school has brought FabLab@School from Stanford University Department of Transformative Learning Technologies Lab (Originally created by MIT and brought to Stanford University by MIT Graduated students ) which is a digital fabrication laboratory that equipped with innovation tools such as 3D printer & 3D scanner, Laser cutter, Vinyl cutter etc., which will help students that are makers and inventors create things and make their project in imagination become real. In this program we have corroboration with Professor Paulo Blikstein from Stanford University and Professor Arnan Sipitakiat from Chiangmai University who assists us and help create new way of learning to learners.

Following his high school career, Smith went to Steubenville for college, becoming perhaps the greatest player in school history. He was twice named an All- American, averaged over 20 rebounds per game and scored 2,048 points for his career. Following the close of his college career, Smith was drafted in the second round of the 1958 NBA draft (15th pick overall) by the Boston Celtics.1958 NBA draft @ basketball-reference.com, accessed November 30, 2014 However, he was drafted into the United States Army as well.

Afghanistan has one of the highest fertility rates, but its levels are decreasing since the fall of the Taliban, as aid workers can now enter the country to help with fertility and decrease mortality rates. Afghan law is influenced by Islamic law, which comes from the Qur‚Äôan. These laws state that abortion is only legal if it is performed to save the life of the mother or if the child is going to be born with a severe disability. This interpretation of Islamic law is based in Islamic medicine, as Muslims cherish the sanctity of human life and believe God does not cause harm or illnesses that are incurable. Due to these constraints, women choose either to pursue an abortion illegally or be shunned by society due to a pregnancy outside of the socially accepted norms. Contraception is approved by Islam when it prevents the formation of the zygote and prevents implantation in the uterus. Birthrates & fertility Afghanistan has one of the highest fertility rates in the world, with very few women actively using contraceptive methods, despite support from the government and conformance with religious ethics. Only 22.5% of people utilize contraceptive measures in comparison to the United States, where 74.1% of people utilize contraception. In the 1990s, the average woman in Afghanistan had 8 children throughout her lifetime, but this decreased in the mid-2000s to 6.3 and by the end of 2010 to 5.1. Since the Taliban's fall in 2001, fertility levels are decreasing, stemming from the Taliban's belief in not educating girls, child brides, and not providing healthcare for women. The decreased presence of the Taliban has allowed an entrance of aid workers to the country to provide educational funding for schools, family planning, and more access to birth control. The uncontrolled high fertility rates make it difficult for Afghanistan to manage the poverty level and improve other social conditions, which leaves a high dependence on aid from other countries. High fertility rates cause high birthrates, which contribute to the high fetal mortality rate. Afghanistan has the highest fetal mortality rate in the world, with 110.6 deaths per 1000 births. Mothers are also 19.9 years old on average at her first birth. As access to education across Afghanistan is increasing due to the fall of the Taliban, the fetal mortality rate is also decreasing. In rural areas the mortality rate still remains high, but aid workers are being sent to many regions of the country after receiving training on deliveries and care for newborns. Religious limitations Islamic law comes from the Qur'an, which they believe comes from God and Muslims use it to dictate their every day actions. The religious laws of Islam dictate strict policies on gender interactions. One of these requirements is that women use a female gynecologist. Islamic rule says that males in the medical field should only treat females if there are no other females in the field to care for them. Women are more likely to seek care from a female gynecologist to conform to their religious convictions. A suggested improvement is to increase the number of female doctors in Afghanistan to encourage seeking professional help rather than nonprofessional help. Islamic medicine ideals are based on the sanctity of human life, which states that God created humans and did not create diseases or other ailments that do not have cures or other solutions that humans have the ability to discover. Muslim teachings say that human life begins at conception because the fetus is able to perform actions within the womb that humans outside of the womb are able to perform, such as movement and digestion. This means that the fetus has a soul. This means that the fetus has rights, which the mother is responsible for protecting until delivery. This leads to the overriding belief that abortion should be avoided whenever possible. Any action that would take away the soul of the fetus is illegal. This includes a pregnant mother being murdered, leading to the murderer being tried for both deaths; or if the father dies while the mother is pregnant, the estate will not be divided until the birth of the child, because the fetus has rights to the estate and the father's inheritances. However, in cases of rape, abortion is not permitted because one crime cannot be solved with another crime, and having an abortion for reasons other than the health of the mother and the baby is considered a crime. If a fetus is predicted to die right after birth, the mother and the father must make the decision, considering all factors, that they feel aligns best with the Qur'an. Islam approves certain forms of contraception as well. Contraceptive methods are acceptable when they prevent ovulation and formation of the zygote. Once the zygote has formed, which means the egg and the sperm have fused, it is considered a human life and thus is protected as such. Ethicists believe that the proper use of contraceptives prevents the need for abortion and the consideration of the moral dilemma. =Stigmatization of abortions= Due to the religious views on abortion, society stigmatizes women who receive abortions. Many women account that they are stuck deciding between whether to have an abortion or have a child outside of marriage, both of which cause them to be ostracized from society. Some reasons that lead women to pursue abortions to avoid being ostracized include drug and/or alcohol addicted husbands, poverty, and being single. Due to the constraints that the government places on access to abortions, women must pursue abortion through illegal means to avoid being shunned by their families or punished criminally. The culture in Afghanistan, developed both from the government and religion, makes women believe that it is their job to have children. This social role for women does not take into account that Afghanistan has an extremely high birthrate, ranked 12th in the world, with little access to education on family planning and contraceptive usage. Current legislation Afghan legislation is based heavily on Islam, with the preamble of their constitution referencing Allah. Article 3 of Chapter 1 outlines that no law in Afghanistan should contradict Islam. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission was created to protect human rights and as a response to Shia Family Law, which violates human rights. The heavy influence of religious beliefs on the law leads to strict laws surrounding abortion. Chapter 4 of the Afghanistan Penal Code outlines the consequences for performing abortions. It states that abortions outside of saving the life of the mother or if the baby's life is endanger, interpreted as a severe disability or low quality of life, are illegal. Article 402 says that anyone who purposefully kills a fetus will be sentenced to no more than 7 years in prison. Article 403 says that anyone who performs the abortion will either be imprisoned or fined up to approximately 12,000 Afghanis (US$165). If the person performing the abortion is a doctor they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Access to abortions Few legal cases allow women to seek abortion care. Women are able to get an abortion when their life is endangered by the pregnancy, or if the baby will be born with severe deformities or disabilities. Religious ethical committees must rule on the ethics and legality of the abortion before it can be carried out. After ethical approval of the abortion, the woman must obtain approval from a gynecologist, three general practitioners, a counselor, and permission of the doctor. One additional situation that occasionally allows abortion to occur is poverty. This is especially prominent in areas that the Taliban is still present in. Within Taliban controlled areas, poverty based abortions are generally approved more often because they have too many children. Women often pursue abortions through illegal means because of the few cases that allow abortions legally. They believe it is necessary in order to avoid shame from their husbands, families, and society. This leads women to having to fund the abortion themselves, which can be difficult because of the social norm that implies that it is women's job to have children and thus they don't have jobs outside of taking care of the house and the family. Many women would prefer not to have children, but lack knowledge on how to limit the number of children they have outside of abortion. When pursuing abortions, they many times need to use uneducated midwives who don't know how to properly perform the procedure or deal with complications. Another option they have is to use expensive private clinics, which leads to the issue of funding the expenditure. Since women are typically unemployed, rounding up the funds for an abortion can be difficult. The price of an abortion has decreased from 250,000 Afghanis (US$3,500) to 17,500 Afghanis (US$250). This decrease has been seen because of the increasing need of abortions. But the price is still 15,000 Afghani (US$150) higher than the average price of an abortion in the United States, where abortions are legal and generally publicly accepted. =Safety of the procedure= Afghanistan is in the top 16 countries worldwide for the highest mortality rate from abortion. The healthcare system in Afghanistan is also not at a level to properly care for pregnant mothers. Every 2 hours there is a pregnancy-related death in Afghanistan. The high maternal mortality is due to lack of post procedure care. Although the procedure is illegal in most cases, women still pursue abortions, motivating aid workers to make it safer. International aid workers are working to improve the safety of the procedures by educating midwives and nurses about how to improve care for their patients and limit the mortality of the procedure. Aid workers hope to decrease the stigma surrounding the procedure so that there is lower mortality.

He is the former football head coach for the University of Maryland. Before Maryland, he was the defensive coordinator at the University of Michigan. He also served as the interim head football coach and defensive coordinator of the Florida Gators football team for the team's 2014 bowl game. Durkin began serving as the head coach of the University of Maryland football team in 2015. Following the practice-related death of player Jordan McNair, Durkin was placed on leave in August 2018. Matt Canada was named acting head coach until further notice. The University System of Maryland Board of Regents reinstated Durkin on October 30, 2018, instigating protests and uproar. University of Maryland President Wallace Loh fired Durkin the next day. Playing career A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Durkin attended Boardman High School where he was an all-conference and all- Northeast Ohio selection. Durkin played wide receiver and outside linebacker at Bowling Green from 1997 to 2000, and served as a team captain his final two seasons. He started a total of 33 games in his career and recorded 131 tackles, including 28 for loss. Durkin led the team in sacks in 1998 and finished second in that category in 2000. He earned a bachelor's degree in business marketing in 2001, and a master's degree in educational administration and supervision in 2004. Coaching career Durkin began a career in coaching immediately following his playing career. He worked as a graduate assistant at Bowling Green under new head coach Urban Meyer in 2001 and 2002, and at Notre Dame under head coach Tyrone Willingham in 2003 and 2004. He returned to Bowling Green in 2005, where he coached defensive ends, linebackers, and special teams on the staff of Gregg Brandon. In 2007, he moved to Stanford on the first staff of Jim Harbaugh, where he served for three seasons as the Cardinal defensive ends coach and special teams coordinator. In 2010, Durkin was reunited with Meyer when he joined the Florida Gators as linebackers coach and special teams coordinator. He remained on Florida's staff when Will Muschamp took over as head coach in 2010, and in 2013 was promoted to defensive coordinator, replacing Dan Quinn. Durkin has a reputation as a strong national recruiter and was named the 2012 Rivals.com Recruiter of the Year. On November 22, 2014, Durkin was named interim head coach for Florida's bowl game after the previous head coach, Will Muschamp, announced he would step down following the regular season. Durkin led Florida to a 28‚Äì20 victory in the 2015 Birmingham Bowl against East Carolina. On January 5, 2015, sources confirmed that Durkin was hired as the defensive coordinator of Michigan. The hire reunited Durkin with new Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh. Michigan confirmed the hire on January 8, and announced that Durkin would also coach linebackers. On December 2, 2015 ESPN's Joe Schad announced that Durkin was expected to be named head coach of the Maryland Terrapins football team, which was confirmed later that day. Durkin would lead the team to a bowl game appearance in his first year. Following a scandal involving the death of a player and reports of a toxic team culture, Durkin was fired by Maryland midway through the 2018 season. On January 2, 2020, Ole Miss announced it had hired Durkin as an assistant to head coach Lane Kiffin, along with Chris Partridge and Joe Jon Finley. Player death at Maryland and resulting scandal On August 11, 2018, Durkin was placed on administrative leave after Maryland was placed under investigation amid toxic culture allegations against the team after the death of player Jordan McNair. McNair was hospitalized on May 29, 2018 after showing signs of heatstroke and exhaustion while participating in a team workout, and later died at the age of 19. He returned 80 days later, after the Board of Regents recommendation to stay. Damon Evans, the athletic director, announced the Board of Regents' decision to the team with Durkin present; Durkin later held a meeting with the team without other coaches, and several players walked out of that meeting. However, due to intense backlash Durkin was fired as head coach on October 31, 2018, just one day after being reinstated.

He was also accused and convicted of an attack on the Belgrade rail station on 25 September 1968, which left 13 people injured. He was executed on 11 January 1978. Origin and early life An ethnic Croat, Hrkaƒá was born in Mokro, ≈†iroki Brijeg, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1947. There are conflicting reports of his trade, some sources identifying Hrkaƒá as a carpenter, others as a mason, while some sources simply identify him as a \\"worker\\". Hrvaƒá may have had a daughter named Milijenka Hrvaƒáa. As of now, no report of a wife or a mother of the daughter is available. Belgrade cinema bombing On 13 July 1968, at 21.05 CET, a bomb detonated in the Belgrade cinema \\"20. oktobar\\". One person was killed and 76-89 others injured, some seriously, including Magdalena Novakoviƒá, a young schoolgirl who lost a leg as a result of the bombing. The bomb was placed under the sixth seat of the 16th row, during the movie Du rififi √† Paname.

Because equity crowdfunding involves investment into a commercial enterprise, it is often subject to securities and financial regulation. Equity crowdfunding is also referred to as crowd-investing, investment crowdfunding, or crowd equity. Equity crowdfunding is a mechanism that enables broad groups of investors to fund startup companies and small businesses in return for equity. Investors give money to a business and receive ownership of a small piece of that business. If the business succeeds, then its value goes up, as well as the value of a share in that business‚Äîthe converse is also true. Coverage of equity crowdfunding indicates that its potential is greatest with startup businesses that are seeking smaller investments to achieve establishment, while follow-on funding (required for subsequent growth) may come from other sources. History  Investment crowdfunding can be debt- based or equity-based, or can follow other models, including profit-sharing and hybrid models. The term equity crowdfunding is often used to describe crowd investing into both debt and equity based instruments when they are offered on an equity crowdfunding platform. The first known equity based crowdfunding platform was launched in 2007 in Australia, called the Australian Small Scale Offerings Board (ASSOB). ASSOB now trades as Enable Funding, a securities licensed equity raising platform that has raised over $150 million for 176 private companies. Over 78% of these companies were still trading profitably at the end of 2017. The first US. based company ProFounder launched model for startups to raise investments directly on the site in May 2011, but deciding later to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model prior to JOBS Act. Early platforms include CrowdCube and Seedrs in the UK. Others like the European startup Exorot.comhttps://www.exorot.com/ invest their own money in every new startup on top of investment received from others on their website. Selling investments via crowdfunding has been called crowdfund investing, hyperfunding, crowdinvesting, or even simply crowdfunding, as in \\"legalize crowdfunding\\". Some have called for standardization of the terminology in a way that distinguishes the practice from other forms of crowdfunding. Debt crowdfunding, also known as peer to peer lending or peer to business lending, allows a group of lenders to lend funds to individuals or businesses in return for interest payment on top of capital repayments. Borrowers must demonstrate creditworthiness and the capability to repay the debt, making it unsuitable for NINA or startups. Regulation Investment crowdfunding can breach various securities laws, because soliciting investments from the general public is often illegal, unless the opportunity has been filed with an appropriate securities regulatory authority, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S., the Ontario Securities Commission in Ontario, Canada, the Autorit√© des march√©s financiers in France and Quebec, Canada, or the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. These regulators have different ways of determining what is and what is not a security but a general rule one can rely on (at least in the U.S.) is the Howey Test. The Howey Test says that a transaction constitutes an investment contract (therefore a security) if there is (1) an exchange of money (2) with an expectation of profits arising (3) from a common enterprise (4) which depends solely on the efforts of a promoter or third party. Any crowdfunding arrangement in which investors are asked to contribute money in exchange for potential profits based on the work of others would be considered a security. As such, the applicable investment contract would have to be registered with a regulatory agency, unless it qualified for one of several exemptions (e.g., Regulation A or Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, or the California Limited Offering Exemption ‚Äì Rule 1001 (also known as S.E.C. Rule 1001)). However, as of October 30, 2015 the SEC adopted Regulation Crowdfunding (\\"Regulation CF\\") under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to implement crowdfunding provisions of Title III of the JOBS Act. Title III added new Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), which provides an exemption from the registration requirements of Securities Act Section 5 for certain crowdfunding transactions. On January 29, 2015, the SEC opened up registration process to approve online platforms intending to legally solicit offerings through equity crowdfunding (Regulation CF). Online platforms operating under Regulation CF are expected to provide investment access via equity crowdfunding as early as mid-May 2016 (pending SEC approval). The penalties for a securities violation can vary greatly and depend on the amount of profit obtained by the \\"promoter\\", the damage done to the investors, and whether a violation is a first time offense. According to Section 5 of the Securities Act, it is illegal to sell any security unless such a sale is accompanied or preceded by a prospectus that meets the requirements of the Securities Act. Crowdfunding is regulated to protect investors. Creators on crowdfunding platforms are often inexperienced and lack the ability to complete funded projects by agreed deadlines. Additionally, amateur investors are susceptible to fraud when they fail to verify projects and \\"free-ride\\" on other investors‚Äô funding histories. Above all, there is an overall risk of failure in early, platform-driven projects.Agrawal, Ajay, Christian Catalini, and Avi Goldfarb. \\"Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding.\\" National Bureau of Economic Research (2014): 63-97. International approaches to regulation  =Argentina= Although it was admitted by the Civil Code, it was not regulated, a task that was recently carried out by the National Securities Commission (CNV), an agency that is the authority of control, regulation, control and enforcement. The Argentine crowdfunding model will flow through collective financing platforms, which must be in charge of a corporation authorized and registered by the CNV. It must have a legal structure, statute and corporate purpose, name, registered addresses, shareholder registration, own website and email, among other requirements. Among its activities, the corporate purpose should indicate that it puts in contact \\"a plurality of human and/or legal persons acting as investors with human and / or legal persons requesting financing\\". =Australia= Crowdfunding as a discrete activity is not prohibited in Australia when raising funds with donations. The provisions of the Corporations Act need to be considered if raising funds with either debt or equity. The Australian federal government's now dissolved Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee (CAMAC) released its report on equity crowdfunding in May 2014. The report proposed a regulatory regime specifically designed for and to facilitate crowd sourced equity funding (CSEF) in Australia. The CAMAC report recommended Australia introduce legislation allowing retail investors to invest up to $10,000 a year in start-ups via equity crowdfunding, with a maximum of $2,500 in each company. It suggested companies be allowed to raise up to $2 million per year on such platforms. In the 2015 Federal Budget, as part of its small business package, the government announced that it would make it easier for small businesses to access capital by allowing crowd- sourced equity funding and by simplifying related reporting and disclosure requirements. 'Treasury 'set aside $7.8 million in funding over four years to enable the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to implement and monitor the regulatory framework to facilitate the use of crowd- sourced equity funding when it is unveiled before the end of 2015. Through 2016 and 2017 proposed amendments to the Corporations Act were debated and finally passed on 22 March 2017 in the form of the Corporations Amendment (Crowd-sourced Funding) Bill 2016 (Bill). The Bill provided 6 months for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) to enable the legislation and a further delay for licensing to occur. On 11 January 2018 the first seven retail AFS Licenees were granted to Big Start, Billfolda, Birchal Financial Services, Equitise, Global Funding Partners, IQX Investment Services and On-Market Bookbuilds. Amendments expanding access to equity crowdfunding for (small) proprietary companies passed parliament into law on 28 September 2018.https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5984 = Austria = Austria introduced a new law in August 2015 which specifically regulates crowdfunding and other alternative forms of investment. The law is meant to set a clear legal framework for crowdfunding to not only make this form of investment more accessible to entrepreneurs, but also to protect the investors better and prevent misuse. =Belgium= Local crowdfunding sites have been active in Belgium since 2011, and the legislation was adapted to cover them in April 2014. This made it possible to raise up to 300k‚Ç¨ per projects via crowdfunding as long as crowd investors' individual investments remained below ‚Ç¨1000. Since this law adaptation was limited, regional governments have confirmed that further improvements of the legislation would remain a priority to address before 2019, and this was officially confirmed by the Flemish government in a published act. = Canada= Canada's first equity crowdfunding portal is Optimize Capital Markets which launched in Ontario in September 2009.\\"Matthew McGrath, CEO/Founder of Optimize Capital Markets, Joins NCFA / VEC Vancouver Equity Crowdfunding Event May 21, 2014\\" Retrieved 27 May 2014.

On May 14, 2015, the securities regulatory authorities of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Qu√©bec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia announced that they were adopting substantially harmonized registration and prospectus exemptions (the start-up crowdfunding exemptions) to allow start-up and early- stage companies in these jurisdictions to raise up to $500,000 per calendar year through online funding portals. These exemptions will be in effect until May 13, 2020. =China= On November 19, 2014 in the State Council address, prime minister Li Keqiang endorsed equity crowdinvesting as part of financial innovation to solve financing difficulties for small and medium enterprises. On January 20, 2015, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the first eight equity crowdinvesting platforms. =Estonia= The first equity crowdfunding system was launched in August 2015 by Fundwise. There is no special law regarding crowdfunding but there is a Good Practice of Crowdfunding guidelines that were set up by Finance Estonia industry association and Deloitte in 2016. =Finland= An Equity Crowdfunding portal was launched in Finland in May 2012 by Invesdor. The legal issues around donation-based crowdfunding have been under debate in Finland as its legislation around this is different from most countries. However the legislation about Equity and Rewards-based Crowdfunding is more similar to the rest of Europe, and the legal situation is clear. Invesdor has also started operating in Sweden and has additionally opened its service to Danish and Estonian companies. The Sweden-based FundedByMe also launched their Equity Crowdfunding portal in Finland in January 2013. =Germany= After two smaller projects in 2010, 2011 can be considered the first successful year for crowdfunding in Germany. The largest crowdfunding project was launched by the company Brainpool in December 2011. For the movie of the successful TV series Stromberg, the company wanted to collect one million euros by March 2012, and the total amount was reached within one week. =Hong Kong= An equity crowdfunding platform may need to be licensed under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571) before it is permitted to carry on a business in, or actively market to the public any services that would constitute, a regulated activity in Hong Kong. In addition, the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's securities regulator, may impose certain legal restrictions or licensing conditions on equity crowdfunding platforms, such as the requirement to provide services only to professional investors (as defined by the Securities and Futures Ordinance and the Securities and Futures (Professional Investor) Rules (Cap. 571D)). =Ireland= Crowdfunding remains unregulated in Ireland. The law with regard to crowdfunding, and in particular equity based crowdfunding is complex. Issues to be resolved and regulations to be reviewed include: * The Prospectus Directive (Directive 2003/71/EC) as transposed into Irish law by the Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) Regulations 2005 (as amended) (the \\"Prospectus Regulations\\"). * The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) (Directive 2004/39/EC) as transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2007 (the \\"MiFID Regulations\\"). * The Investment Intermediaries Act 1995. * The Consumer Credit Act 1995. =Israel= Israel has yet to enact legal framework for equity crowdfunding. Therefore, any equity crowdfunding activity is currently regulated under the Israeli Securities Law which permits the offering of securities to 35 non accredited individuals and an unlimited amount of accredited investors as defined in Israel Securities Law. The Israeli Securities Authority has proposed a new regulatory framework for equity crowdfunding in Israel, which has not been adopted yet. Some of the main terms are: * An aggregate financing amount of up to ILS2 million over 12 months * Limitation of the amount to be invested by each individual to ILS10,000 unless the investor is \\"wealthy\\" * A sophisticated investor (as defined in the regulations) must contribute 10% of the total financing amount * Office of Chief Scientist approval. =Italy= In July 2013, Italy became the first country in Europe to implement a complete regulation on equity- crowdfunding, which applies only to innovative startups and establishes, among other rules, a national registry for equity crowdfunding portals and disclosure obligations for both issuers and portals. The first equity crowdfunding campaign launched in Italy was a success, raising a total of ‚Ç¨157,780 in three months, exceeding its initial target of ‚Ç¨147,000. =Malaysia= In June 2015, the Malaysian Securities Commission (MSC) approved six equity platforms to begin operation by the end of the year. The approved platforms include Alix Global, Ata Plus, Crowdonomic, Eureeca, pitchIN and CrowdPlus . =Netherlands= In April 2011, Symbid was founded in the Netherlands by Robin Slakhorst and Korstiaan Zandvliet as one of the world's first investment crowdfunding platforms. In December 2014, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets published ‚ÄòCrowdfunding ‚Äì Towards a sustainable sector‚Äô which provides insight into how the crowdfunding market in the Netherlands can develop into a sustainable one. =New Zealand= New Zealand enacted the legal framework for equity crowdfunding in 2013 and corresponding regulations in 2014. The regulations allow each New Zealand company to raise up to $2 million in any 12 months from the New Zealand public through a licensed equity crowdfunding platform without the usual offer document prescribed under securities law. PledgeMe and Snowball Effect were the first two platforms to receive licences Snowball Effect launched New Zealand's first equity crowdfunding offer in August 2014, with craft brewery Renaissance Brewing successfully raising $700,000 in 13 days. In March 2015, Invivo Wines became the first New Zealand company to raise $2 million, the maximum amount allowed under New Zealand regulations.Adams, Christopher (2015). Invivo first to equity crowdfund $2m. The New Zealand Herald. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid;=11425279Smylie, Calida (2015). Invivo Wines beats equity crowdfunding records. The National Business Review. http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/invivo-wines-beats-equity- crowdfunding-records-cs-170770Stone, Gabriel (2015). Invivo 'ecstatic' at crowdfunding record. The Drinks Business. http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2015/03/invivo-ecstatic-at-crowdfunding- record/ In October 2015, the Financial Markets Authority licensed a new equity crowdfunding portal called AlphaCrowd that said it would focus only on digital and technology companies and would also aim to attract Chinese investors to New Zealand. = Poland = The activity of equity crowdfunding platforms on the Polish market has been specified by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority in May 2019. The platforms are not subject to special regulations, and can act on the basis of the Act on Entrepreneurs' Law, stating that the entrepreneur may take all actions except those prohibited by law. For a platform to allow to make investment decisions, it's obliged to provide detailed information about a financial instrument offered. Hence, it can be assumed that the equity crowdfunding platform acts as an \\"advertising column\\" enabling issuers to carry out only promotional campaigns. The June 14, 2017 Regulation of the European Parliament and the EU Council raised a threshold for no-prospectus issues to the limit of EUR 1 million, every 12 months. The directive entered into force on July 21, 2018. However, according to the provisions of the EU directive, the Polish regulator may increase the limit to EUR 8 million. One of the first equity crowdfunding platforms in Poland and Central and Eastern Europe is Beesfund, founded in 2012. As of October 2019, 55 issues for a total amount of PLN 31.6 million (US$8 million) were collected on the platform, with the participation of 26,000 investors. In February 2019, the idea of collecting equity money online gained significant media attention after the success of the offering of the football club Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w. Within 24 hours, it raised PLN 4 million (US$1 million), as the fans became owners of over 5 percent of its shares. In 2020, the Warsaw Stock Exchange will launch its own equity crowdfunding platform named Private Market. =Portugal= The crowdfunding activities in Portugal had not been targeted by legislation until 2015. The first equity crowdfunding platform to receive the regulatory approval from the UK Financial Services Authority was Seedrs, co-founded by Portuguese Carlos Silva. SyndicateRoom another online UK-based equity crowdfunding was also co-funded by Portuguese Gon√ßalo de Vasconcelo. Some of Portugal's crowdfunding platforms are PPL, a donation and reward-based crowdfunding platform for funding every kind of projects, MassiveMov, founded in 2011 aiming to be a funding alternative for innovative projects and Raize, a debt-based crowdfunding platform. Novo Banco Crowdfunding is another initiative in partnership with PPL which aims to raise money for social projects promoted by NGOs and charities and are 10% co-financed by NOVO BANCO, founded in 2011 aiming to be a funding alternative for innovative projects. The Portuguese crowdfunding legislation, Lei 102/2015 de 24 de agosto Regime jur√≠dico do financiamento colaborativo states that from now on crowdfunding will be monitored by CMVM(Securities Market Commission) and every platform needs to be registered at DGC (General Consumer Office). It recognizes four types of crowdfunding: donation, reward, equity and debt. According to the law, the investors can receive the money back if the announced conditions are not complied. CMVM is given 3 months to create the supervision norms and regulations to be applied in this area but the new rules apply only to projects that start after the publication of the law. =Singapore= Equity Crowdfunding currently falls under the Collective Investment Scheme which is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). MAS governs the crowdfunding activities under the Securities and Futures Act (Cap.289), and the Financial Advisers Act (Cap. 110). MAS controls equity-based crowdfunding the same way it controls debt-based crowdfunding. For both cases, the crowdfunding platform must have a Capital Markets Service (CSL) license. If a platform also wishes to offer advice to investors, it should acquire a license as a financial advisor. =Spain= In Spain, the new Law 5/2015 was signed to promote business financing and regulate crowdfunding. =Sweden and Norway= Crowdfunding portals have also launched in Scandinavia supporting both local language crowdfunding and English language crowdfunding. The oldest active crowdfunding platform in Sweden today is crowdculture launched in 2010. The system works with a unique hybrid mechanism where crowdfunding works as abase to crowdsource public investment decisions. The donation-based CrowdFunding portal FundedByMe has been active in Sweden and Norway since 2011, and Swedish crowdfunding activity is evolving in parallel to Crowdfunding in the US with Equity-Based CrowdFunding becoming active in Sweden late in 2012. Invesdor also started operating in Sweden in February 2013. =Switzerland= The oldest and most active crowdinvesting platform in Switzerland is investiere.ch. Crowdinvesting was responsible for 48% of the total money raised via crowdfunding in Switzerland in 2013. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority has not established specific regulations for crowdinvesting platforms. Instead, each platform is reviewed on a case-by-case basis to decide whether the platform requires a license to operate. In general, if the money raised is only brokered via the platform and not centrally pooled in any way, unlicensed providers are acting within the law. =United Kingdom= On 1 April 2014, the regulation of the consumer credit market transferred from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This includes responsibility for regulating loan- based crowdfunding. The FCA has published a policy statement regarding crowd funding in March 2014. Abundance Generation was the first debt crowdfunding platform in the United Kingdom (UK) to be regulated by the Financial Services Authority (now the Financial Conduct Authority). It was approved in July 2011 and was launched to the public in 2012. Abundance Generation provides democratic finance to UK-based renewable energy developers. On 6 July 2012, Seedrs Limited was launched as the first equity crowdfunding platform to receive regulatory approval from the Financial Services Authority. In August 2012, Richard Branson announced his support for crowdfunding, crowdinvesting and crowdlending platform BankToTheFuture.com in the Telegraph newspaper. In February 2013, the CrowdCube equity crowdfunding platform, which was launched in 2011, was authorised by the FSA. On 18 March 2014, the first investor-led equity crowdfunding platform, SyndicateRoom, was authorised by the FCA. In May 2014, Crowd for Angels, which is considered the first debt and equity crowdfunding platform authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), launched. In March 2015, Eureeca was the first international platform to receive regulatory approval from the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. In April 2017, Capital Cell, a specialist platform for biotech and life sciences crowdfunding from Spain, launched its subsidiary in the United Kingdom and received regulatory approval from the Financial Conduct Authority in September 2017. =United States= Equity crowdfunding platforms Before June 16, 2015, equity crowdfunding (under Regulation D) was limited to individuals meeting certain net worth and income levels (accredited investors) and was conducted by a licensed broker-dealer. Notable platforms for accredited crowdfunding include Wefunder, AngelList, EquityNet, CircleUp, SeedInvest, and EnergyFunders. On May 16, 2016, Title III of the 2012 JOBS Act's Regulation CF came into effect which allows equity crowdfunding (also referred to as \\"Regulation Crowdfunding\\"), regardless of net worth or income. It must be conducted by a licensed broker-dealer or via a funding portal registered with the SEC. Even before the law came into effect, many crowdfunding services launched to fill this role. Early portal Profounder closed before SEC guidelines were released, and equity portal Earlyshares acquired charity portal Helpersunite. Wefunder and StartEngine were two of the first Funding Portals to be approved. Wefunder became the first successful platform to hit the $1 million raise maximum in the first months following the law coming into effect. A number of other portals have since launched, and many accredited crowdfunding platforms have entered the non-accredited market as well. As of 2017, 25 funding portals have registered with SEC and FINRA to operate in the United States.FINRA: Funding Portals We Regulate https://www.finra.org/about/funding-portals-we-regulate Federal legislation Thanks in part to the Crowdfunding exemption movement, the JOBS Act was signed into law by President Obama on April 5, 2012. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been given approximately 270 days to set forth specific rules and guidelines that enact this legislation, while also ensuring the protection of investors. http://crowdfundinglawyer.us Some rules have already been proposed by the SEC. The bill went through a number of amendments and on April 5, 2012 President Barack Obama signed the JOBS Act into law. The legislation mandates that funding portals register with the SEC as well as an applicable self-regulatory organization to operate. Regulation A offerings places limits on the value of securities issuer may offer and individuals can invest through crowdfunding intermediaries. An issuer may sell up to $1,000,000 of its securities per 12 months, and, depending upon their net worth and income, investors will be permitted to invest up to $100,000 in crowdfunding issues per 12 months. An independent financial statement review by a CPA firm is required for raises $100,000‚Äì500,000 and an independent financial statement audit by a CPA firm is required for raises over $500,000. Regulation CF offerings would prescribe rules governing the offer and sale of securities under new Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933. Individual investments in a 12-month period are limited to the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of annual income or net worth, if annual income or net worth of the investor is less than $100,000; and 10% of annual income or net worth (not to exceed an amount sold of $100,000), if both annual income and net worth of the investor is $100,000 or more (these amounts are to be adjusted for inflation at least every five years); and transactions must be conducted through an intermediary that either is registered as a broker or is registered as a new type of entity called a \\"funding portal\\". On October 23, 2013, the SEC unanimously approved the progress of the crowdfunding bill and SEC commissioners explained that the commission's goals are to ease online fundraising for small companies and fraud protection for investors. As of the date of approval, the proposal is open for public comment for a 90-day period that is followed by another SEC vote to enable the enactment of the proposal. In parallel to the SEC regulations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is creating additional rules related to member firms engaged in crowdfunding. Regulation CF went into effect on May 16, 2016. The FINRA has played a role of evaluating and approving applications of funding portals. State legislation Some people see the federal crowdfunding legislation as unworkable, and several U.S. states have recently enacted or are considering their own crowdfunding exemption laws, to facilitate intrastate investment offerings that are already exempt from federal (SEC) regulation. These include the Invest Kansas Exemption, effective August 2011, and the Invest Georgia Exemption, effective December 2012, has $1m/$10k caps. Late in 2013, both Michigan and Wisconsin joined Kansas and Georgia. As of April 2013, the states of Washington and North Carolina are considering their own crowdfunding exemptions. In July 2012, the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions issued an advisory, about legislation proposed, intended to allow crowdfunding to raise up to $1 million from non-accredited Wisconsin investors without audited financial statements, or up to $2 million if the issuer has audited financial statements.http://www.wdfi.org/_resources/indexed/site/fi/securities/CrowdFundingAdvisory.pdf Crowdfunding insurance The draft SEC rules calls for portals to purchase a fidelity bond of at least $100,000. As stated by the SEC, a \\"fidelity bond .. aims to protect its holder against certain types of losses, including but not limited to those caused by malfeasance of the holder's officers and employees, and the effect of such losses on the holder's capital\\".https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2013/33-9470.pdf A fidelity bond generally covers a corporate policyholder from first party losses arising from the theft of money, securities or other tangible property so if the portal's employees steal the funds belonging to the crowdfunding company, the bond can be useful. However, if there is a claim against the portal for negligence in providing its services as a portal, the more proper insurance policy to apply to this loss is a professional liability insurance. The final SEC rules waived this requirement.

Buffington was a prominent figure in the area and one of the wealthiest men in the city of Eau Claire. Life and career Buffington was born in Little Valley, Cattaraugus County, New York in 1825, the son of Isaiah and Sophia (Winchester) Buffington. He was raised in Onondaga County, New York, until he was seventeen years old. He then came with his parents to Walworth County, Wisconsin, where he worked at farming, teaming, or anything by which he could make a living. In 1846, he married Pluma A. Jones. In the same year, he bought a piece of land nearby and had a log cabin built. Subsequently, he purchased a stage line running from Kenosha to Beloit. Two years later, he sold the stage line to Frink, Walker & Company. He and his wife moved to Stephenson County, Illinois, where he purchased 160 acres of land and began farming. In 1850, Buffington sold his land and holdings in Illinois and moved to Dodge County, Wisconsin, where he was appointed Undersheriff and also elected Justice of the peace. At the same time he made investments in the grocery and sale stable businesses. Through these different endeavors Buffington managed to save $12,000 dollars. At the age of thirty, Buffington came to Eau Claire, Wisconsin where he purchased real estate. In 1857, he relocated his family to the area. He made a brief purchase of the Niagara House, and subsequently began steam boating. From 1858 to 1859, Buffington built the \\"Chippewa Valley\\" steamboat, which he ran until 1861. The boat was captured on the White River and burned after the Civil War broke out. In 1859, Buffington purchased a fifty percent stake in the Ball & Smith sawmills,History of the Lumber and Forest Industry of the Northwest which were afterward known as the Smith & Buffington Mill Company. In 1874, the company was incorporated as the Valley Lumber Company with Buffington serving as President. Buffington served as the chairman of the township board for a number of years, and was also elected to serve as the fourth Mayor of Eau Claire in 1875, an office that has since been abolished. He was an alderman on the Eau Claire City Council for several decades, and was also the chairman of the Eau Claire County Board of Supervisors. He was an active member in Freemasonry and the Knights Templar. Death Buffington died in 1893 at the age of 67. Legacy Buffington Drive is a street on the upper west side of Eau Claire named for Mr. Buffington's contributions to the area. The Buffington Neighborhood Association is on the west side of the city as well. Buffington is regarded as having the foresight to forecast the quickly drying out industry of logging and its dependent industries at the confluence of the Eau Claire and Chippewa Rivers as early as 1885. He is quoted as saying, \\"Gentlemen, you had better get something while you can, because we've seen the last sawmill built in Eau Claire.\\" The area would never again be seen as the wellspring of economic activity that it had been. Buffington's quote is displayed on the walking trail of Phoenix Park in downtown Eau Claire. Buffington is interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Eau Claire.

Proposed by Andrzej Stanislaw Cieplak in 1980, it predicts anomalous results that other models of the time, such as the Cram and Felkin‚ÄìAnh models, cannot justify. In the Cieplak model, electrons from a neighboring bond delocalize into the forming carbon‚Äìnucleophile (C‚ÄìNuc) bond, lowering the energy of the transition state and accelerating the rate of reaction.Cieplak, A. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1981, 103, 4540 Whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the C‚ÄìNuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to. The nucleophile may be a number of reagents, most commonly organometallic or reducing agents. The Cieplak effect is subtle, and often competes with sterics, solvent effects, counterion complexation of the carbonyl oxygen, and other effects to determine product distribution. Subsequent work has questioned its legitimacy (see Criticisms).  Background  The Cieplak effect relies on the stabilizing interaction of mixing full and empty orbitals to delocalize electrons, known as hyperconjugation.Alabugin, I. V.; Gilmore, K. M.; Peterson, P. W. WIREs Comput. Mol. Sci. 2011, 1, 109 When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full œÉ (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty œÉ* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap. center The Cieplak effect uses hyperconjugation to explain the face-selective addition of nucleophiles to carbonyl carbons. Specifically, donation into the low-lying œÉ*C-Nuc bond by antiperiplanar electron-donating substituents is the stabilizing interaction which lowers the transition state energy of one stereospecific reaction pathway and thus increases the rate of attack from one side. In the simplest model, a conformationally constrained cyclohexanone is reduced to the corresponding alcohol. Reducing agents add a hydride to the carbonyl carbon via attack along the Burgi‚ÄìDunitz angle, which can come from the top along a pseudo-axial trajectory or from below, along a pseudo-equatorial trajectory. It has long been known that large reducing agents add hydride to the equatorial position to avoid steric interactions with axial hydrogens on the ring. Small hydride sources, however, add hydride to an axial position for reasons which are still disputed.Eliel, E. L.; Senda, Y. Tetrahedron 1970, 26, 2411 center The Cieplak effect explains this phenomenon by postulating that hyperconjugation of the forming œÉ*C‚ÄìH orbital with geometrically aligned œÉ orbitals is the stabilizing interaction that controls stereoselectivity. In an equatorial approach, the bonds that are geometrically aligned antiperiplanar to the forming C‚ÄìH bond are the C‚ÄìC bonds of the ring, so they donate electron density to œÉ*C‚ÄìH. In an axial approach, the neighboring axial C‚ÄìH bonds are aligned antiperiplanar to the forming C‚ÄìH bond, so they donate electron density to œÉ*C‚ÄìH. Because C-H bonds are better electron donors than C‚ÄìC bonds, they are better able to participate in this stabilizing interaction and so this pathway is favored. center  Evidence  Cieplak's proposal is supported by investigating the effects of various electronic substituents on product distribution. By installing an electron-withdrawing substituent such as a methoxy group at the C2 position, the reduction of substituted cyclohexanones begins to favor equatorial attack.Senda, Y.; Nakano, S.; Kunii, H.; Itoh, H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1993, 2, 1009 This is because the axial C-O bond is a worse electron donor than a C‚ÄìC bond, so axial attack is less favored. center Cieplak also demonstrated this effect by introducing electron withdrawing substituents on C3, which decrease the electron-donating capability of the ring C‚ÄìC bond and therefore disfavor equatorial attack, which is antiperiplanar to this bond.Johnson, C. R.; Tait, B. D.; Cieplak, A. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5875 Electron-donating substituents at C3 subsequently favor equatorial approach, since increasing C‚ÄìC electron density favors œÉC-C donation into œÉ*C-Nuc and thereby encourages equatorial approach. center This effect can also be investigated by changing the electronic nature of the nucleophile. In the case of an electron-deficient nucleophile, the œÉ* of the forming C-Nuc bond is lower in energy and better stabilized by attack antiperiplanar to electron-rich axial C-H bonds. Attack therefore occurs axially.Favre, H.; Gravel, D. Can. J. Chem. 1961, 39, 1548 If the nucleophile is electron-rich, however, the donation of more electron density is less favored and equatorial attack may prevail.Meakins, G. D.; Percy, R. K.; Richards, E. E.;Young, R. N. J. Chem. Soc. C, 1968, 1106 These trends have been observed even when normalizing for steric bulk of the nucleophile. center In substituted norbornones, nucleophilic attack will come antiperiplanar to the bonds which can best donate into œÉ*C-Nuc.G. Mehta, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990, 112, 6140 The bonds positioned for this interaction are the bridgehead C‚ÄìC bonds on the six-membered ring. Substituents which donate electron density to these bonds, such as ethyl groups, increase the rate of addition anti to the alkyl groups, which is the antiperiplanar trajectory. If electron-withdrawing substituents such as esters are appended to the C‚ÄìC bonds, however, the selectivity favors syn addition, so that the bonds donating into œÉ*C-Nuc are the more electron-rich C‚ÄìC bonds which are hydrogen-substituted.Kaselj, M.; Chung, W-S.; le Noble, W. J. Chem. Rev. 1999, 99, 1387 center A similar example is seen in substituted 2-adamantones, where varying the electronic properties at the remote 5 position has profound effects on product distribution.Cheung, C. K.; Tseng, L. T.; Lin, M. H.; Srivsstava, S.; le Noble, W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986, 108, 1598 A hydroxyl group is able to donate electron density inductively to the forming œÉ*C‚ÄìH bond antiperiplanar, so attack from that side is favored. The electron-withdrawing ester substituent, however, lacks this stabilization ability. Instead, the C‚ÄìH bonds are better electron donors than the C‚ÄìCO2Me bonds, so attack comes anti to the hydrogen substituents and subsequently syn to the ester group. This explains the effect of remote electron-donor groups on stereochemical outcomes, which has been difficult to explain with other stereochemical models. The rigidity of the adamantone skeleton allows for tight control of conformation and minimization of competing effects.Srivastava, S.; le Noble, W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987, 109, 5874 center  Criticisms  The Cieplak model has been met with mixed reviews, and criticisms of both its basic logic and predictive ability have emerged. The stabilizing interaction of donating electron density into the transition state œÉ* orbital of a forming bond was immediately questioned, as this interaction has been widely invoked to explain exactly the opposite‚Äîthe destabilization of bonds.Frenking, G.; Kohler, K. F.; Reetz, M. T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991, 30, 1146 Traditionally, forming bonds are stabilized when they donate electron density from their bonding HOMO into a neighboring antibonding LUMO, not by accepting electron density into their LUMO. To this end, David A. Evans said of Cieplak's proposal: \\"Structures are stabilized by stabilizing their highest energy filled states. This is one of the fundamental assumptions in frontier molecular orbital theory. The Cieplak hypothesis is nonsense.\\"Siska, S. (2001, February). The Evolution of Models for Carbonyl Addition. Evans Group Afternoon Seminar. Lecture conducted from Harvard University, Cambridge, MAEvans, D. A. Chemistry 206 Lecture Notes (2006), Lecture 22 \\"Carbonyl and Azomethine Electrophiles-2\\". However, Hahn and le Noble refute this point by invoking the principle of microscopic reversibility, where the process of bond formation and cleavage are fundamentally equivalent in an equilibrium, and little value should be placed on the terms ‚Äòbonding‚Äô and ‚Äòantibonding‚Äô, œÉ or œÉ*.Hahn, J. M.; le Noble. W. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 1916 In another criticism of the model, Houk questions Cieplak's fundamental assumption that C-H bonds are better electron- donors than C-C bonds.Rozeboom, M. D.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982, 104, 1189 This point is still contested and represents another major dispute in the field. To further refute the Cieplak effect, Houk puts forth a system in which Cieplak's model predicts the wrong product distribution trend. In the case of substituted trans-decalones, electron-withdrawing substituents equatorial at C4 should discourage equatorial attack and yield more axial product, since the ring C‚ÄìC bonds are deactivated for donation into the forming C-Nuc bond. Experimental evidence, however, shows that axial electron- withdrawing C4 substituents are more directing towards axial attack than equatorial substituents.Wu, Y-D.; Tucker, J. A.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 5018 Since axial orbitals are not aligned for hyperconjugation in this system, Houk rationalized this trend by invoking electrostatic arguments, described below. center  Alternative explanations  In an effort to explain the surprising stereoselectivies in the systems above, alternative explanations to the Cieplak effect have been proposed. In substituted cyclohexanones, the tendency of small reducing agents to add hydride axially is proposed to be caused by torsional strain instead of hyperconjugation.Juaristi, E. Conformational Behavior of Six-Membered Rings. Wiley, 1995. Online. In an equatorial attack, the nucleophile approaches by eclipsing a neighboring hydrogen atom and subsequently pushes the carbonyl substituents into eclipsing positions as it pyramidalizes the carbonyl carbon.Wigfield, D. C. Tetrahedron 1979, 35, 449 In an axial approach, the nucleophile approaches gauche to neighboring hydrogen atoms and so does not cause eclipsing interactions while pyramidalizing the carbonyl carbon. It is this torsional strain‚Äîthe energy cost of rotating the bonds out of an eclipsed position‚Äîthat favors axial over equatorial approach. In the case of substituted norbornones, stereoselectivity may be explained by electrostatic interactions between substituents and nucleophiles. Electron-withdrawing groups create a partial positive charge on the alpha carbon, which interacts favorably with the partial negative charge on the incoming nucleophile.Paddon- Row, M. N.; Wu, Y-D.; Houk, K. N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992, 114, 10638 This interaction may guide attack syn to the electron-withdrawing substituent, and anti to electron-donating substituents. This conclusion is supported by computations, where modeling the partial charges predicts product distribution without including orbital interactions.Ganguly, B.; Chandrasekhar, J.; Khan, F. A.; Mehta, G. J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 1734 The same explanation has been made to justify similar results in the case of substituted adamantones.Adcock, W.; Cotton, J.; Trout, N. A. J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 1867 center Similarly, in Houk's trans-decalone system, the nucleophile with its partial negative charge prefers to attack away from the partial negative charge of the acyl ester. When this substituent is axial, the equatorial pathway brings the nucleophile into closer proximity and is therefore disfavored.Northrup, A. B. (2003, September). Hyperconjugation. MacMillan Group Meeting. Lecture conducted from University of California, Bekeley, CA. This is less pronounced for equatorially substituted ester because the group is now positioned further away from the carbonyl. center References Category:Organic chemistry ","title":"Cieplak effect"},{"id":"44558578","text":"Samsenwittayalai School (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏±‡∏¢) (abbreviation: \\"SS\\" (Thai abbreviation: ‡∏™.‡∏™.)) is a high school located at Bangkok's Phaya Thai District. The number of students in this school approximately 3,600 students from Matthayom 1 to Matthayom 6. Samsenwittayalai School is one of 283 very selective schools in Thailand. It admits about 240 Matthayom 1 students yearly, but has more than three applicants for each place. The is led to some dubious practices. In 2017, the school director was removed from his position when he was accused of demanding a 400,000 baht payment for admitting a student. He was subsequently found guilty and fired from his position. He was found to be involved in other bribery cases worth a total of about eight million baht. \\"His guilt was obvious as he took the money but failed to put it in the school's coffers\\", said an official of the Office of Basic Education Commission (OBEC). School symbol The symbol consists of a beacon above an abbreviation of the school inside a circle. The mark also consists of a philosophy with the meaning of that philosophy written around the circle. The name of the school is on a green ribbon under the circle. School flag The symbol of the school is placed at the corner of a flag which is half pink and half green, the school colors. History In 1951, the Ministry of Education (Thailand) built a school in Bangkok (previously called: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£) named Rang Nam School (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥). On 20 December 1951, the Ministry of Education renamed it Sriayudhya School (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ò‡∏¢‡∏≤). Then on 1 July 1953, the Department of General Education moved the male students who have no school in, but the place was too crowded. The ministry of Education then established a new school and the construction started on 16 April 1954 and the male students moved here on 15 April 1955. The official name was given: Samsenwittayalai School (Thai: ‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏±‡∏¢). The students, parents and teachers than had a decision to hold an event to honour the school on 15 April, but it is inconvenient because it is during the summer break. In 1983, the first ever \\"Samsenwittayalai Day\\" event was hold on 28 January, which is the establishment day of Samsen Alumni Association, and it is repeated every year since then. The activity is offering alms to 99 monks by all the students and teachers and giving awards to the teachers who have made a remarkable progress. In 1962, Mattayom 7 was started and the school is excellent in sports, especially football. The words have spread and there are fans of the school's football team since then. In 1967, the school changed from all-boy to co-education. In 1995, the school has a new branch named Ratchananthachan Samsenwittayalai 2 School. In 2004, the school established \\"Math-Science Enrichment Program (MSEP)\\" and \\"English Program (EP) in the following year. In 2011, the school established \\"English Integrated Studies\\" and \\"Enrichment Science Classroom (ESC)\\" in the next 2 years. Building * The first building (Building 1) was constructed in 1954. This building consists of an agriculture classroom, greeting room, meeting room, old Samsenwittayalai student association room, infirmatory, office of finance and asset management and office of student affairs. * The Science and Mathematics Building (Building 2) was all wooden, but it was rebuilt in 1969 into a 4-story concrete building. This building consists of science and math classrooms, science and math teachers' office, academics office and student record office. The flag pole is also located here, which the length was lengthen on June 2017. Building 2 exterior (taken September 2018) * The third building (Building 3) was first built in 1954 and rebuilt in 1974 into a 5-story building. This building consists of an audiovisual room, ICT room, language classrooms, social studies classroom, teachers' office and learners' development activities office. Minimart, parents and teachers association's office and student council office. The extension of this building (meeting rooms, administration office and more classrooms) was done in 2001 and a school bank was established (sponsored by Government Savings Bank (GSB)) in 2011. * The Art Building (Building 4) was first built in 1963 and rebuilt in 1989 into a 5-story building. It has a library on the first floor and consists of an art and music classrooms. In 2017, 2 classrooms (room 4201 and 4202) was renovated and changed to be arts exhibition hall. The library is also renovated in the same year. * The Home Economics Department (Building 5) is a 2-story building. It has a cooking class and a lounge on the first floor and The home economics class on the second. * The Gym (Building 6) is used for physical education class. The building itself is a badminton court and a P.E. teachers' office. Next to the building there is a tennis court, which was built in 2002. It functions as tennis court, basketball court, volleyball court, indoor futsal field and other ball games. Now this building is demolished and will be rebuilt with building 7 to be a 6-story multipurpose building. * Industrial Arts (Building 7) was built in 1964 for home economics classes. The first floor is industrial work study. The second floor has both the architecture class, handcrafting class and business classroom. Now this building is demolished and will be rebuilt with building 6 to be a 6-story multipurpose building. * The English Program Building (Building 8) was built in 1964 as an asset of Ministry of Educaition and handed over to Samsenwittayalai School in 2002. The exterior was renovated and now it is the building of all English Program Students. It has its own computer lab, science labs, dance classroom, music classroom, English Program Office and management office. Building 8 (taken May 2015) * Building 9 is an extension of building 4 for art-language students and the library. The first and second floor is an extension of the library, and the third and fourth is the language classrooms for higher secondary students. * Multipurpose building was built in 1977. The cafeteria is located here on the first level and the grand multipurpose room on the second. * New building currently not finished building. This building is connected to The Science and Mathematics Building and many people call it the PePo building because of its three colors.

After released there it flows through Little Rock Wash into the Antelope Valley of the western Mojave Desert. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Little Rock Reservoir due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. History According to the toponomastic scholar, Erwin Gudde, \\"little\\" often refers to a place name when it is near to a larger geographic feature, in this case Little Rock Creek being close to Big Rock Creek The fifth Pacific Railroad Survey led by Lt. Robert Stockton Williamson and Colonel John Parke visited Little Rock Creek in 1853, as they surveyed the north slope of the San Gabriel Mountains. The first non-native settlement in the area was Santiago Garc√≠a, who was born circa 1833. He built an adobe on the north side of Little Rock Creek approximately to the east of where the creek turned from north to east near Totem Pole Ranch. At this wet spot, where the San Andreas fault system forced water to the surface, the Garcia cienaga (canyon) was located. Santiago Garcia was killed in 1873 by a grizzly bear in what was later named Santiago Canyon. Watershed and Course Little Rock Creek's originates just west of the summit of Mount Williamson and flows down the north slope of the San Gabriel Mountains. Its main tributaries are South Fork Little Rock Creek and then Santiago Canyon Creek just before reaching Little Rock Reservoir. At Little Rock Dam it becomes Little Rock Wash which terminates in the Antelope Valley. Little Rock Creek is part of the Antelope Valley Watershed, which is a closed endorheic basin with no outlet. It is part of the South Lahontan Hydrologic Region. Ecology Lower Little Rock Creek is home to the endangered arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus), a factor leading to the closure of Little Rock Road and the forested areas upstream from the reservoir. The upper segment of the creek is located in the newly designated Pleasant View Ridge Wilderness area and supports an important population of endangered mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa). The Little Rock Creek watershed was protected by the October, 2014 designation of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument.

The lectures were written and given in 1828 by Frances Wright. The collection includes two volumes: * Volume I - With three addresses on various public occasions, and a reply to the charges against the French Reformers of 1789. It includes seven lectures and three addresses. It was published in 1829. * Volume 2 - Historical and political, being an introductory to a course on the nature and object of America's political institutions. It was published in 1836  Overview  Wright delivered these lectures in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and several other cities. In the preface, Wright addresses the People of the United States as her audience, giving them permission to ‚Äúexamine‚Ä¶judge‚Ä¶adopt‚Ä¶or to discard the views‚Äù set forth in her work. Wright's objective in these lectures was to ‚Äú[attempt] reform by means of instructional improvement‚Äù. She further stated that, ‚ÄúI have‚Ä¶applied myself to develop what is true [rather] than to expose what is false‚Äù.  Volume I  Volume I contained the following lectures and addresses: = Lectures I-III = * On the nature of knowledge * Of free inquiry, considered as a means of obtaining just knowledge * Of the more important divisions and essential parts of knowledge The first three lectures focus on knowledge in the epistemological sense. Wright begins by acknowledging that all men, from savage to statesmen, will practice and preach what they hold to be true without regard for their potential ignorance. In other words, men believe that what they think is true, is indeed true solely based on the fact that they are the ones believing it. Wright cites ignorance being the greatest contributor to this logical fallacy. From here, Wright explains her conception of knowledge by explaining, ‚Äú[knowledge is] what there is for us to know, the means we possess for acquiring such knowledge as is of possible attainment‚Ä¶and to seek in our knowledge the test of our opinions‚Äù. In general, Wright posits that the knowledge we accumulate takes two distinct forms: knowledge that is taught and knowledge that is accumulated through experience. The knowledge that is taught to us is not necessarily known. To her, a more appropriate word for this type of information would be belief. This is in contrast to the form of knowledge that we know from our direct experience. Wright says that this kind of knowledge is more accurate because it comes from our own experience; therefore, it is more familiar to us. Wright summarizes by saying that, ‚ÄúKnowledge signifies things known‚Äù . = Lectures IV-V = * Religion * Morals In the following two lectures, Wright examines her conception of knowledge in relation to religion and morality. As stated in Lectures I-III, Wright posits that knowledge implies that things are known; therefore, for any subject to have truth, it must be built on empirical foundations. Wright sees religion, as a subject, lacking on these factual foundations. To provide clarity to her readers, Wright attempts to outline what she deems an appropriate subject, or science, containing truth. In the beginning, Wright acknowledges that there must be facts that are known through our experience and direct observation. With these empirical foundations, Wright explains that we have our premises from which we can build an appropriate science. Without these factual premises, the science would be built on false foundations. Wright compares this to building a castle in the air. Religion, to Wright, is a science built on false foundations. With much disagreement among people as to the appropriate practices of religion, the falsehood of religion should be evident. If religion were built on empirical foundations, Wright suggests the truth should be evident and there would be no disagreements therefore. Furthermore, Wright explains that the mere fact that the knowledge gained through religion is primarily belief, as opposed to experiential knowledge, exposes religion's falsehood. = Lectures VI-VII = * Opinions * On existing evils and their remedy Wright begins the last two lectures by critiquing the role that opinions have played in our history. She begins by suggesting that an appropriate and mature understanding of opinions could have prevented many of the problems that were being faced during her time. Again, Wright cites ignorance as the greatest contributor to error. Anger, Wright suggests, is an unwarranted, but often felt emotion in response to differing opinions. To solve this problem, Wright explains that an individual receiving the opinion must simply inquire as to what facts the opinion was derived. From there, the individual can determine whether the opinion is true or false. Neither of these results should spur hostility or anger. From this position, Wright continues on to explain how the existing evils, such as slavery and sexism, had come into existence. She explains these grievances in relation to her conception on knowledge as well as her position on opinions. = Addresses = * Address I. - delivered in the New Harmony Hall, on the fourth of July, 1828 * Address II. - delivered in the Walnut- street Theatre, Philadelphia, on the fourth of July, 1829 * Address III. - delivered at the opening of the Hall of Science, New-York, Sunday, April 26, 1829 The book concludes with a Reply to the traducers of the French Reformers of the year 1789.

Set in a mining town in southern Illinois, the plot revolves around John Barrington Ashley, who is accused of murdering his neighbor Breckenridge Lansing. The novel was written over the course of twenty months while Wilder was living alone in Douglas, Arizona. The Eighth Day was the 1968 winner of the National Book Award. Synopsis During a weekend gathering of the Ashley and Lansing families, Breckenridge Lansing is shot while the men are practicing shooting. Townsfolk suspect that Eustacia Lansing, Breckenridge's wife, and John Ashley were having an affair. Ashley is tried, convicted, and sentenced to execution. Miraculously, days before the scheduled execution, he is rescued by mysterious masked men. He then escapes to Chile, where he assumes the identity of a Canadian named James Tolland and finds work in the copper mining industry. While Ashley escapes to Chile, his family‚Äîleft destitute without his income‚Äîturns to running a boarding house to make ends meet. His son, Roger, assumes a fake name and moves to Chicago. After working a series of odd jobs, Roger makes a name for himself as a writer for a newspaper. Ashley's daughter, Lily, also assumes a fake name and becomes a famous singer in Chicago, later moving to New York. In the end of the book, it is revealed that a group of Native Americans, one of whom was friends with Roger, is responsible for helping Ashley escape his execution. The group did this because, after a flood wiped out their local church, Ashley loaned them money to rebuild it. It is also revealed that Ashely did not kill Lansing; Lansing's son George did, because Lansing was becoming violent towards his wife, George's mother. George feared for his mother's safety, and consequently killed his father and then ran away to San Francisco, and later Russia, to work as an actor. Though there is a murder mystery in the novel, the main focus of the work is the history of the Breckenridge and Lansing families. Wilder muses frequently on the nature of written history throughout the book. Towards the end, he writes: > \\"There is only one history. It began with the creation of man and will come > to an end when the last human consciousness is extinguished. All other > beginnings and endings are arbitrary conventions ‚Äî makeshifts parading as > self-sufficient entireties‚Ä¶ The cumbrous shears of the historian cut out a > few figures and a brief passage of time from that enormous tapestry. Above > and below the laceration, to the right and left of it, the severed threads > protest against the injustice, against the imposture.\\" The book concludes with a number of flash-forwards describing the rest of the lives of the characters. Ashley's wife, Beata, moves to Los Angeles and starts a boarding house there. Roger marries one of Lansing's daughters. Ashley's daughter Sophia suffers from dementia and moves into a sanitarium. Ashely's daughter Constance becomes a political activist and moves to Japan.  Critical reception  The Eighth Day received the National Book Award in 1968. The New York Times called the book \\"suspenseful and deeply moving\\". Goodreads says the book \\"has been hailed as a great American epic\\".
