In the survey of 100 fans, only the answer will be true. If you can answer all of the questions, you will get all the points. On the answer board, the number of answers is reduced and the game is doubled or tripled as the game progresses. The family with the most points wins the family contest through the two single points questions have 8 answers and 7 answer, two double points questions have 6 answers and 5 answers, a triple point question has 3 answers and the answer can be failed only one time. The first family that reaches the point of 300 can win the game early. The family must continue to compete in Big Money. =Big Money= The two winning family members play Big Money for a cash bonus opportunity.

There are five questions that need to be answered quickly and there is a time limit for them to answer. The time begins after the first question. If the contestant has difficulty answering, he or she can skip the other question and can reanswer passed question if time is left. The first contestant will receive a total of five questions that can be answered after or over time. The second contestant was issued an answer to these five questions. Both compete in the same rules, but the five-second time limit is extended to the next contestants (the first 25, the extension 30); Also, if the second contestant copies the first answer, there is a loud noise and he has to answer again. Depending on the total score of the two contestants, a score of 1,000 ks. per point is awarded. Five-time champion will be retired and the two other groups will be entered.

As Kethu worshipped the deity, this place was known as Sempambinkudi Naganathar. Presiding deity The presiding deity in the garbhagriha is represented by the lingam known as Rudrakodisvarar and Naganathar. The Goddess is known as Tirupurasundari and Karpuravalli. Specialities During the churning of divine ocean, Amrita came out. While Devas and asuras fought for the amritha, Vishnu decided to give it to Devas. At that time an asura took the form of a Deva and drunk it. Knowing this, Chandra and Surya informed Vishnu about this. Vishnu hit the asura and killed him. The head of asura fell in Sirapuram which is now known as Sirkazhi and the body fell in other place which was known as Sempambinkudi and later became Sempankudi and Sempankudi. Due to consuming of Amrita, his body became two parts which in turn into two snakes. They worshipped Shiva to get rid from it. Shiva bestowed blessings and thus came into existence Rahu, with human head and snake body and Kethu with snake head and human body. Later they became one among the Navagrahas. Structure The temple has a compound wall with an entrance. After entering through the entrance bali pita and nandhi could be found. In the prakara shrines of Vishnu, Ganesha, Subramania with his consorts Valli and Deivanai are found. The shrine of the Goddess is facing south. In the prakara, saptamatas are found. Kethu is found in a separate shrine. In the kosta, Dakshinamurthy, Lingodbhava and Durga are found.

Biography Tessa Leuwsha was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands as a daughter of an Afro-Surinamese father and a Dutch mother. She started her career as a ground stewardess for KLM. A publisher asked her to write a travel guide to Suriname, because the country supposedly had the best bami and roti. The guide which was first published in 1997 as Reishandboek Suriname, became a success. After many reprints, it has been renamed Wereldwijzer Suriname. In 1996, she moved to Suriname to become a freelance journalist writing for Opzij, de Volkskrant, and De Ware Tijd Literair among others. In 2005, She made her debut as a literary writer with De Parbo-blues, a coming of age story with autobiographical elements: a girl from mixed parents leaves for Suriname to discover the history of her father who comforted his homesickness with music and marihuana. De Parbo-blues was well received, and was nominated for the ANV Debutants Award. Leuwsha started to work for the Dutch Embassy in Paramaribo, continued her writing career with Solo, een liefde, and contributed to a reprint of Anton de Kom's classic Wij slaven van Suriname. In 2018, she wrote and directed Frits de Gids, a story about lovers caught between the western world and Maroon traditions, which was released by VPRO Cinema. In 2020, Leuwsha gave the sixth Cola Debrot Lectures which was pre-recorded and published on YouTube due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In her 2020 novel Plantage Wildlust, Leuwsha did not focus just the known inequalities on a plantation in 1911, but also the subtle rivalry between freed slaves and the Indo-Surinamese contract workers, and the complex hierarchy between the owner and black supervisor. The supervisor being more experienced than the newly arrived owner expected to be in charge of the daily activities, and the owner inevitably resorted to cruelty to put him back in his place. The film rights for Plantage Wildlust have been bought by Staccato Films and will be turned into a full- length movie. Leuwsha is married with two children.

It was built between 1894 and 1900 by Si Sa'id, a vizier and the brother of Ba Ahmad ibn Musa, the Grand Vizier and effective ruler of Morocco during the same period under Sultan Abdelaziz (ruled 1894‚Äì1908). The palace was turned into a museum in 1932, and has been restored several times since.  Architecture  The palace's architecture is similar in ornament to the Bahia Palace built further south by his father and his brother, but unlike the latter it is built over more than one level and has very different layout. Its architectural highlights include a grand reception hall on the upper floor and a large riad garden with a central pavilion of painted wood.  Museum collection  The museum collections includes a wide variety of objects, many of them from the southern regions of Morocco. Until recently the museum's exhibits focused on Moroccan wooden art and objects. Its current exhibits now focus on weaving and Moroccan carpets. Among the most significant objects of the general collection is an elaborately carved marble basin from the Caliphate era of Cordoba. It was crafted at Madinat al-Zahra between 1002 and 1007 to serve as ablutions basin and was dedicated to 'Abd al-Malik, the son of al-Mansur, and was previously kept at the Ben Youssef Madrasa for centuries.

Lubin is an American neuroscientist and Associate Professor of Neurobiology and an Associate Professor of Cell, Developmental, and Integrative Biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham within the School of Medicine. Lubin is the Principal Investigator of the Lubin Lab which explores the epigenetic mechanisms underlying cognition and how these mechanisms are altered in disease states such as epilepsy and neurodegeneration. Lubin discovered the role of NF-Œ∫B in fear memory reconsolidation and also uncovered a novel role for epigenetic regulation of BDNF in epilepsy leading to memory loss. Lubin is a champion for diversity at UAB as the Co-Director of the Roadmap Scholar Program and as a faculty mentor for several institutional and national programs to increase retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM.  Early life and education  Lubin grew up in New York and attended high school in New York City. While in high school, she worked as a nursing assistant in New York City during the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. At the time she had a desire to pursue a career in medicine, but her experience in the clinic showed her that academia and science are where cures are discovered. Before completing high school, Lubin toured many American Historically Black Colleges and Universities and became acutely aware of the barriers to career success due to her identity as a Black woman in science. Motivated to overcome these barriers, Lubin pursued her undergraduate degree at Alabama State University in 1992. She received a full scholarship and participated in the National Institutes of Health sponsored Minority Biomedical Research Support Program. Her summer research experience at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City highlighted her passion for scientific discovery and she chose to pursue a career and academia. In 1996, Lubin obtained her Bachelors of Science in Biology with a Minor in Chemistry from Alabama State University, graduating summa cum laude with honors for her senior research thesis in the lab of Eddie Moore. Lubin then returned to New York State to join the Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program at Binghamton University (SUNY). She trained under the mentorship of Dennis W. McGee exploring cytokine signalling in epithelial cells. Lubin inhibited integrin signalling in epithelial cells and exposed them to proinflammatory cytokines. She found that a3B1 integrin signalling may be responsible for suppression of cytokine responses in epithelial cells during inflammation and wound healing. After completing her graduate training in 2001, Lubin pursued postdoctoral training at Baylor College of Medicine in the Texas Children's Hospital under the mentorship of Anne E. Anderson. Lubin explored how glutamate signalling is coupled to nuclear factor-kappa B expression and transcriptional regulation in the hippocampus. She found that kainate, a glutamate analog, elicited activation of NF-Œ∫B via the classical IkB kinase pathway and both ERK and PI3K were implicated in regulation of transcription via NF-Œ∫B in hippocampal area CA3. In 2006, Lubin pursued further postdoctoral training in the lab of David Sweatt at Baylor College of Medicine. Lubin moved with the lab to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and continued her postdoctoral training there. During this second phase of her postdoctoral training, Lubin explored epigenetic transcriptional regulation of fear memory reconsolidation. She found that fear memory retrieval activates the NK-kB signalling pathway and leads to epigenetic modifications of the gene promoters in the hippocampus via IKKa-mediated mechanisms. Lubin then discovered a role for epigenetic modifications of the bdnf gene in fear memory consolidation. She found that bdnf DNA methylation altered bdnf transcription and that blocking BDNF expression in the hippocampus resulted in impaired fear memory consolidation. Upon completion of her postdoctoral fellowship, Lubin became one of the first UAB scientists to obtain a K99 NIH grant to support her transition into her independent career.  Career and research  In 2009, Lubin became an Assistant Professor of Neurobiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham as well as an Investigator in the Evelyn McKnight Brain Institute and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Cell Biology. She was then promoted to Associate Professor and now holds appointments in the Comprehensive Center for Healthy Aging, the Comprehensive Neuroscience Center, the Center for Glial Biology and Medicine, the Center for Neurodegeneration and Experimental Therapeutics, the Civitan International Research Center, and the Center for Craniofacial, Oral, and Dental Disorders. Lubin is also actively involved in recruitment as well as continued support of the academic and medical trainees at UAB. In 2017, Lubin became Co-Director of Research Training for the NIH/NINDS Mentored Experiences in Research Instruction, and Teaching (MERIT) Program which supports postdoctoral fellows at UAB in achieving their career goals. Lubin also serves on the admissions committee for the graduate program in Neuroscience and is a member of the advisory board for the Medical Scientists Training Program. Lubin is also the Principal Investigator of the Lubin Lab where she leads a research program centered around exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms of epigenetic modifications that mediate cognition and that become aberrant in disease processes such as epilepsy and memory disorders. She has found that transcription implicated in memory formation is tightly regulated by DNA methylation in the hippocampus. = Histone methylation in memory consolidation = Lubin is a pioneer in the study of histone modifications in cognition. Early in her independent career she explored the role of histone methylation in memory formation. She found that histone methylation is actively regulated in the adult hippocampus and that methylation is required for the long-term consolidation of fear memories. In 2012, Lubin and her team discovered the critical role for GLP lysine dimethyltransferase complex mediated lysination and methylation in both the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex during memory consolidation. = Histone methylation in memory consolidation = Lubin and her group then explored the role of epigenetic methylation in the retrieval of memories. She found that retrieval of fear memories increased the levels of H3K4me and 5hmC methylation in the dorsal hippocampus. Her findings supported the link between methylation and hydroxymethylation in gene transcription associated with memory retrieval in the hippocampus. = Memory loss in epilepsy = In 2015, Lubin and her team discovered a role for DNA methylation in the memory loss associated with epilepsy. They detected aberrant DNA methylation patterns at the bdnf gene in rat models of epilepsy and investigated how these might be impacting memory formation. They found that epilepsy decreased DNA methylation of the bdnf gene leading to increased levels of BDNF which impaired memory consolidation. When they artificially increased the methylation at the bdnf gene, this led to improvements in memory in epileptic animals. = Advocacy = Lubin is a fervent advocate for diversity in STEM and has dedicated herself to enhancing diversity and opportunities for underrepresented minority students to excel in STEM at the University of Alabama. In 2014, Lubin helped to establish the NIH/NINDS Roadmap Scholar Program for graduate students in neuroscience at UAB. Lubin is now the Co-Director of the program. In this role, Lubin oversees and coordinates graduate student mentoring, social and networking events, workshops and other initiatives to support underrepresented graduate students in neuroscience. She serves as a faculty mentor in the program to guide students to career success in neuroscience and she also co-organizes the yearly NEURAL Conference to bring together underrepresented minority students from across the country to share their research and scientific accomplishments. Lubin is also a mentor for the UAB Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science Chapter. Her support of underrepresented junior faculty and postdoctoral fellows at UAB is felt through her involvement in the Health Disparities Research Education Program as a Grant Reviewer.

Bail amounts of $78, the surcharge cost of Hennepin County court fees, are also common. The organization supports abolition of bail fees. History The Minnesota Freedom Fund was founded in 2016 by Simon Cecil, a graduate student at the University of Minnesota who received a $5,000 grant through the university's Carlson School of Management and a further $5,000 from a business competition, the Acara Challenge. By April 2017, the organization reported having posted bail for 33 people, all but two of whom had attended their trial. In 2018, the fund paid $9,464 across 113 bail cases. By March 2020, the group reported having provided bail money in 500 cases, including a limited number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the group sought the release of more inmates, concerned about the virus spreading rapidly throughout the prison population. It removed its upper limit of $1,000 in bail payments. Following the killing of George Floyd in May 2020, the fund received $20million in donations over a four-day period, public postings of donations to the group becoming popular on Twitter. On June 2, 2020, the group temporarily suspended further donations, suggesting that visitors to their website donate to the non-profits Black Visions Collective, Reclaim the Block, Rebuild Lake Street, Northstar Health Collective or West Broadway Business and Area Coalition.

They are commemorative books given as gifts to guests at Thai funerals, and usually include a biography of the deceased as well as other literary material. Their publication, which dates to the late nineteenth century, was initiated among royalty and nobility, then taken up by wealthy commoners and, later, the wider middle class. These books, whose contents range from compilations of religious texts and historical manuscripts to essays and writings on general knowledge in various fields, are regarded as a valuable historical source by Thai studies scholars, and are actively collected and traded. History The exact origins of the tradition of giving books as commemorative gifts are unclear, though it probably derived from the practice of distributing gifts at celebratory events (such as major birthday anniversaries) as well as funerals. Some scholars have traced the practice to the earlier commissioning of handwritten volumes in samut khoi folding book format. These would contain a selection of Buddhist texts in Pali language, often extracts from the seven books of the Abhidhamma, which were sometimes combined with the Thai version of Phra Malai. A colophon would often include information on the occasion, the sponsor of the manuscript, and for which purpose it was produced. These manuscripts have been tentatively dated to as early 1807, though this claim of a written tradition has been disputed. The earliest known printed cremation volume is generally regarded to be that published for the royal cremation ceremony of Queen Sunanda Kumariratana (a consort of King Chulalongkorn) and her daughter in 1881: a selection of Buddhist verses and chants, of which 10,000 copies were printed. A possible earlier example, sets of the epic Phra Aphai Mani printed by Samuel J. Smith for the royal cremation of King Mongkut in 1869, was discovered in 2006, though it has yet to receive further in-depth study. Printing had been introduced to Thailand by American missionaries in 1835, and quickly gained popularity from the 1860s. The increased accessibility of the press and the medium led to a gradual proliferation of commemorative books, especially cremation volumes, which were seen as more lasting in value than the usual trinket gifts, and were commissioned by noble and well-to-do families following the royal example. A significant trend beginning in the 1900s was collaboration with royal libraries, who provided material for publication which previously existed only as manuscripts. Through the process, the cremation volumes brought these manuscript documents into print and helped build the libraries' book collections, in effect allowing the families to make merit on behalf of the deceased by contributing to the libraries' mission of spreading knowledge. The earliest volume printed in this tradition is a book of chants dedicated to Chaokhun Chommanda Samli, one of Mongkut's consorts, in 1901. Many that followed were printed through arrangements with the Vajira√±ƒÅ·πáa Library (the precursor of the National Library), which committed to assuring the quality of printings and received a portion of the books from each printing as contributions to its funding. Towards the mid-twentieth century, the publication of cremation volumes increased along with the expanding middle class, especially merchant families of Chinese origin. The format of the books began to diversify, and so did the nature of their content, which more often became directly dedicated to the deceased. By the turn of the century, the practice of printing books for funerals had begun to decline, and again became more limited to the wealthy. In some cases, books have been enhanced or supplanted by digital multimedia such as DVDs. Contents Cremation volumes mainly consist of two parts: a commemoration of the deceased, and content chosen for publication, which may or may not be directly relevant to the person's life. Most early volumes consisted only of the selected work, and commemorated the deceased only through a mention of the occasion of the printing on the title page. Later ones would come to include biographies (or autobiographies) of the deceased as well as eulogies by family and friends. The appearance and quality of printing of cremation volumes vary widely, and mostly reflect the social and financial status of the family producing the work. Some may be ornately designed and printed in colour, while others may be simple pamphlets of Buddhist proverbs with a cover bearing the name of the deceased. The included works initially featured Buddhist texts. In 1904, Chulalongkorn suggested that a broader range of topics of more interest to people be printed. As more cremation books were published through arrangements with royal libraries during the following decades, the libraries became more involved in suggesting titles for publication. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, who headed the Vajira√±ƒÅ·πáa Library, was especially influential, compiling and editing essays and stories for the purpose, including the Prachum Phongsawadan, an extensive series of topical histories covering areas such as gambling in Thailand, Thai theatre, Thai orchestras and Thai warships. Topics touched ranged from art, music, literature, linguistics and poetry, to Thai traditions and customs, ranks and titles of the nobility, and writings and travels of kings. Nevertheless, up until the 1950s, the subject matter of most cremation volumes did not stray far from the realms of religion, history and archaeology. As the printing of cremation volumes became a more private affair, their coverage evolved. Some featured selected writings of the deceased themselves, while others may have reprinted works of their favourite authors. Many covered topics directly related to the lives and work of the deceased, while historical biographies, travel, language and cooking were also popular subjects. Health and medical knowledge, especially covering their particular causes of death, gained popularity in the 1970s, though religious writings continued to be the most popular subject featured in most cremation volumes. Collection and research Cremation volumes on sale at a rare bookseller's booth at Book Expo Thailand 2020 Cremation volumes are valued by historians and researchers as a source of information, both for the historical works they feature and the biographical content covering the deceased, which often contain anecdotal first-hand information and can provide reflections on the underlying social structures of the period. They are also of interest to non-academics; a particular area concerns cookbooks, which have been collected by well-known chefs of Thai cuisine. David Thompson, Bo Songvisava and Bongkoch Satongun have based their menus on the books' recipes. As the books are self-published and do not enter the regular market, instead being immediately given out and dispersed, their acquisition can be difficult. Extensive collector's circles are dedicated to them, and an active market has developed around their trade, which takes place primarily through sellers of rare and used books. Most books reach this second-hand market when families dispose of their old collections. Dealers are also known to hire people to attend funerals specifically to obtain them. Several foreign libraries have made efforts to acquire cremation volumes, and major collections are held by the National Library of Australia, the University of Michigan Library and Kyoto University, the last of whose Charas Collection includes over 4,000 volumes, the largest outside of Thailand. In Thailand, many libraries hold cremation volumes in their rare book collections, and a central dedicated repository was established in 1972 at the library of Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, following an initiative by columnist Nares Naropakorn. It now has over 24,000 items in its collection. Since 2015, the Thammasat University Library has been digitizing the collection, and over 6,400 items (as of 2019) have been made available electronically through the library's website and the Internet Archive.

Walther was the son of Gerard WaltherHans Haug, ¬´Le Floril√®ge de Nassau-Idstein ¬ª, L'≈íil, , d√©cembre 1961, . He probably trained in the workshop of miniaturist Friedrich Brentel. He left Strasbourg around 1618 and returned in 1635. He was elected to the Grand Council of the city in 1659. His meeting in Strasbourg with the Count was a decisive moment in his career, since the Count became one of his most important patrons. This was an era when the purpose of a florilegium was to serve as a pictorial catalogue of a garden, and correspondence shows that the Count invited Walther to Idstein near Frankfurt to spend the spring and summer months there to paint flowers and fruits from the garden - Walther did so on at least eight occasions between 1654 and 1674. The paintings were bound into anthologies of which only three versions are known - one at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has 133 flower studies and a number of views of the garden that are painted on paper and bound in two volumes, another at the National Library of France, a codex of 54 gouaches on parchment, and the final set at the St√§del Museum in Frankfurt am Main which has two volumes of the Florilegium with 130 gouaches of flowers on parchment.http://jessieweihsuanchen.com/books-of-painted-flowers-on-paper-and- parchment-rethinking-the-florilegium-as-a-book-genre/ Walther was the great- uncle of the painter Fran√ßois Walter (1755-1830).

The aim of the organization is to act as a training center for transferring advanced manufacturing technology to the Thai industry.  History and mission  The Thai-German Institute was established by the Cabinet of Thailand in September, 1992. It was founded as a joint initiative of the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany. To stress its oriented-ness towards the industry, the TGI was set up as an autonomous body outside the formal education system with its operation under the supervision of the Foundation for Industrial Development and a broad oversight by the Ministry of Industry. TGI officially started operation in 1995, in a zone north of Bangkok, with the assistance of the German multinational company Festo. TGI was the largest joint-venture project in Thailand at the time. TGI's first training courses started in January of 1998. In 2001, TGI was involved in assist the Thai Petroleum Institute in restructuring and improving the competitiveness of the Thai petrochemical industry. Its involvement in this project constituted providing technical training to increase skilled workers within the industry. Germany and Thailand renewed their technical cooperation agreement to operate the TGI, by treaty, in 2003. This was registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations on 21 Dec 2004. TGI embarked on a program to promote and educate Thailand's engineering industries in machine calibration and probing technologies in 2009. The aim of this effort was to help improve manufacturing processes and they enlisted the cooperation of British engineering company Renishaw to help with this endeavor by signing a Memorandum of understanding (MOU) with them. In 2014, TGI started working with Thailand's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) and Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) co-developed project WATER (Wise Antenna for Transmission Execution and Receiving System) to develop an S-BAND antenna to communicate with Thailand's Thaichote satellite. It was reported on November 8th, 2016 that TGI, along with the 10 other independent organizations under the Ministry of Industry, were to be tasked to develop key Thai industries. This was part of the Ministry of Industry's proposed plan for a new venture capital fund to support startups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in gaining access to funding. In 2017, TGI announced that in accordance with the government's Thailand 4.0 strategy, it would take on an important role in assisting in the upgrading of target industry productivity by enhancing technology, innovation, and human resources in the robotics and automation industry so that they will be capable and competitive in the Industry 4.0 era. Mr. Somwang Boonrakcharoen, President of TGI, said that his organization had researched and studied the needs of the Thai industrial sector over the past 20 years and had found a constant lack of human resources in Computer Numerical Control (CNC), Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), Mould and Die and Automation. As part of their efforts, TGI's research and development department collaborated with Epson Thailand to provide advice and training to Thai industry via their \\"TGI-EPSON: Epson Robot-ics Innovation Center\\". In a 2019 interview with TGI's Vice President of Manufacturing Automation and Robotics Center, Varin Rodphothong, it was noted that TGI had become a unit operating under the CoRE (Center of Robotics Excellence). Its specific duties under CoRE included certifying and supporting entrepreneurs in the robotics and automation industry, developing commercial prototypes and training personnel for the robotics and automation industry. On April 9th, 2019, it was announced that TGI collaborated to organize the 2nd \\"SMART AUTOMATION 4.0\\" competition lead by [Rajamangala University of Technology]. The competition was held in three phases from July through October of 2019. It was officially noted in the summary of Thai cabinet resolutions on April 24th, 2019 that TGI was part of meetings to determine how technology and innovation could be applied to both agricultural and industrial sectors.  Services and training  TGI was initially setup mainly as a training institute. In the early 2000's, this was delivered by a Thai staff of around 90 people supplemented by five German technical specialists and one German co-director funded by GTZ. The TGI offers short courses for further training of employees as well as specialized job-entry training according to a company's needs. They have been cited by national organizations for their low- cost advanced technical training. Part of the reason for the low cost of the training is that there are international funds, like the Japanese Miyazawa programme or fund, available to cover the costs of some training, with up to 70% of the course costs being subsidized. Some of the types of training and services it offers: * ‚Äòtailor-made training‚Äô for companies * further training for vocational school teachers * advisory and consulting services in technology and training * joint projects * high-tech product promotion * machine time sharing TGI training covers such technologies as: * industrial automation technology * process control * industrial electronics * programming and operation of Cumputer Numerical Control machines * applications of Computer-aided design CAD and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) * Plastic injection moulding * Tool and Die Making * Mould making * Metrology Foundation for Industrial Development TGI, along with seven sister institutes, falls under the oversight of the Foundation for Industrial Development (FID), which is sometimes referred to in translation as The Industrial Development Foundation. The Board of Directors of the FID provides oversight to the Board of Directors of the institute. The other institutes under the FID are: * Thailand Textile Institute (THTI) * National Food Institute (NFI) *Management System Certification Institute (MASCI) * Electrical and Electronics Institute (EEI) * Thailand Automotive Institute (TAI) * Iron and Steel Institute of Thailand (ISIT) * Plastics Institute of Thailand (PITH) Ministry of Industry Network Industry Network Logo On 1 March 2019, the driving committee of the institutions under the Ministry of Industry aimed to create public awareness of its network of institutions. An Industry Network logo was created to be used in publicizing the mission of the institution networks as a symbol of their cooperation in driving Thailand‚Äôs mission in the digital age. TGI is one of the institutes in this network and displays the symbol as one of its members.

Svedoƒçanstva (Testimonies) was a Yugoslav literary periodical published every ten days from 21 November 1924 to 1 March 1925. It was the first periodical based in Belgrade espousing surrealistic ideas in literature.  Formation  Svedoƒçanstva continued the trend of the monthly Putevi (Roads, 1922‚Äì1924), a modernist periodical. The differences among the various groups contributing to Putevi made it impossible to continue together, and the young and more radical group started Svedoƒçanstva.  Content  The first issue of Svedoƒçanstva was heterogeneous in content and open to experimentation. Among the first few contributors were future surrealists Marko Ristiƒá, Milan Dedinac, Du≈°an Matiƒá and Aleksandar Vuƒço. It contained the first mention of the term \\"surrealism\\" in Belgrade, and was published two months after Andr√© Breton's Manifeste du surr√©alisme. The first issue was dedicated to Tin Ujeviƒá, Croatian poet and bohemian. The editors announced that Svedoƒçanstva would be a publication for experiments in literature, favoring poetic dream over concrete reality. The first four issues were mainly dedicated to poetry. A part of the fifth issue indulged in the interpretations of dreams and prophecies, while the sixth issue, with a foreword by Du≈°an Matiƒá, was dedicated to the confessions of mentally ill people. The seventh issue was the culmination in the experiments by representing \\"Hell\\" by visionary testimonials of deaf and blind persons, criminals, suicidal people and executioners. The last issue took for its theme \\"Paradise\\", examining the roots and true meaning of the world, and reducing it to a dream world and lie. Although Svedoƒçanstva denied it was a surrealists' organ, and although it never published any manifestos by surrealists, and its contributors denied being surrealists, the content of Svedoƒçanstva indicates that it was the first periodical in Belgrade espousing surrealistic ideas in literature.  Legacy  Between the cessation of Svedoƒçanstva and 1930, there was no periodical in Belgrade with a clear surrealistic orientation. Former contributors spread into various other periodicals, such as 50 u Evropi (50 in Europe, 1928), Tragovi (Trails, 1929) and Veƒçnost (Infinity). In 1930, the Belgrade surrealists came out with their first publication, the almanac Nemoguƒáe (The Impossible). There, they presented themselves as a formal group and outlined their goals and activities. The group mentioned past publications to which its members contributed ‚Äì Putevi, Svedoƒçanstva and Tragovi, omitting 50 u Evropi since it had assumed a different orientation in 1930. A second periodical named Svedoƒçanstva was published biweekly in Belgrade during 1952 and was edited by Aleksandar Vuƒço. Besides literature, the new Svedoƒçanstva dealt with art, science, politics and social issues. Contributors to the magazine included Miroslav Krle≈æa, Ivo Andriƒá, Josip Vidmar, Milan Bogdanoviƒá, Isidora Sekuliƒá, as well as earlier surrealists, Marko Ristiƒá and Du≈°an Matiƒá. The magazine was an example of the cultural liberalization of 1950's Yugoslavia.

He was educated at Eton College, where he took part in the Fowler's match of 1910 and captained the college cricket team in 1912. From Eton, Wigan went up to Magdalen College, Oxford.Mr D. G. Wigan. The Times. 16 January 1959. p. 13 While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket for Oxford University in 1913 and 1914, making six appearances. He scored 119 runs in his six matches, at an average of 14.87 and a high score of 73 not out. Due to the commencement of the First World War in July 1914, his time at Oxford was prematurely cut short, denying him his blue. Wigan served in the war, being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps in September 1914. He was promoted to lieutenant in December 1914. He was later made a temporary captain, but relinquished the rank in June 1915, having been repatriated to England suffering from neurasthenia, for which he was not successfully treated. During his absence from the front he was promoted to the full rank of captain in August 1916. His ill health led to him being invalided out of the army, with Wigan retiring from active service in June 1917. Following the war, he settled in Suffolk where he took up farming. Despite being invalided, he commanded his local Home Guard unit during the Second World War, though these duties too took a further strain on his health. Later in life he served as a justice of the peace for Suffolk. Wigan died in December 1958 at Pettistree, Suffolk. He was survived by his wife, Mabel, whom he had married in October 1915.

The club is one the oldest and most successful clubs in the AFLHCC.  Club History  Australian rules football was first introduced to the Hunter Region by Ballarat gold miners John, Jim and George Duguid in the early 1880s with the first clubs being Newcastle City, Northumberland, Wallsend & Plattsburg, Singleton and Lambton. Matches between clubs were privately organised between clubs. But despite the game's promising start in terms of gaining a foothold within the region the sport had died out due to lack of players and support due to the decline of coalmines in Newcastle and the effects of the depression at the time in the mid 1890s. The sport would be revived for a short time before dying off again on and off but it wasn't until 1948 after the end of World War II, that Australian rules was there to stay with the Newcastle Australian Football League being founded with inaugural clubs Waratah, Mayfield, Broadmeadow and Newcastle City. The Carlton Football Club gave Newcastle City permission to use the uniform identical to their own club kit. The club won its first NAFL premiership in 1950, and again three years later in 1953. The 1960s was one of the most successful eras for Newcastle City, winning six premierships during the decade with four in a row from 1963 to 1966, with the 1964 season seeing the Blues go through undefeated. Another six more premierships came in the 1970s with 1973 being another undefeated year for the club. However, the 1980s only saw one premiership in 1981, and a 14 year premiership drought followed until Newcastle City won their last NAFL premiership in 1995. Following the merger between the Newcastle and Central Coast leagues to form the Black Diamond Australian Football League in 2000, Newcastle City didn't find their feet within the new competition until 2003 when they captured the flag that year by beating the Cardiff Hawks by 42 points. The two sides met again three years later in a Grand Final but ultimately it would be the Hawks who would prevail. Another Grand Final loss followed in 2007, losing by 23 points to Killarney Vale. However the following season of 2008 saw another premiership win for the Blues, beating Cardiff by 37 points, and going on to win another three premierships in a row. Newcastle City missed out on the big dance in 2012 but went on to beat Terrigal-Avoca in the 2013 decider with more flags to follow in 2016 and 2018. 2018 has been their most recent Grand Final appearance, beating Terrigal-Avoca by 22 points. With a total of 24 premierships, Newcastle City are the most successful club in the AFLHCC. Newcastle City has produced an AFL Women's player, Sarah Halvorsen (Greater Western Sydney Giants).

It employs a consistent classical Hamiltonian energy function for metals, oxides, and organic compounds, linking biomolecular and materials simulation platforms into a single platform. The reliability is often higher than that of density functional theory calculations at more than a million times lower computational cost. IFF includes a physical-chemical interpretation for all parameters as well as a surface model database that covers different cleavage planes and surface chemistry of included compounds. The Interface Force Field is compatible with force fields for the simulation of primarily organic compounds and can be used with common molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo codes.Materials Studio 7.0 Program Suite and User Guide. Biovia/Accelrys, Inc.: Cambridge, UK, 2015. Structures and energies of included chemical elements and compounds are rigorously validated and property predictions are up to a factor of 100 more accurate relative to earlier models.  Origin  Interatomic potentials were developed for amino acids as early as in the late 1960s, for example, serving the CHARMM program. The fraction of covered chemical space was small considering the size of the periodic table, and compatible interatomic potentials for inorganic compounds remained largely unavailable. Different energy functions, lack of interpretation and validation of parameters restricted modeling to isolated compounds with unpredictable errors. Specifically, assumptions of formal charges, fixed atoms, and other approximations often led to collapsed structures and random energy differences when allowing atom mobility. A concept for consistent simulations of inorganic-organic interfaces was introduced in 2003. A major obstacle was the poor definition of atomic charges in molecular models, especially for inorganic compounds. IFF utilizes a method to assign atomic charges that translates chemical bonding accurately into molecular models, including metals, oxides, minerals, and organic molecules. The models reproduce multipole moments internal to a chemical compound on the basis of experimental data for electron deformation densities, dipole moments, as well as consideration of atomization energies, ionization energies, coordination numbers, and trends relative to other chemically similar compounds in the periodic table (the Extended Born Model). The method ensures a combination of experimental data and theory to represent chemical bonding and yield up to ten times more reliable and reproducible atomic charges in comparison to the use of quantum methods. This approach is essential to carry out consistent all- atom simulations of compounds across the periodic table that vary widely in internal polarity. IFF also allows the inclusion of specific features of the electronic structure such as œÄ electrons in graphitic materials and in aromatic compounds. Another characteristic is the systematic reproduction of structures and energies to validate the classical Hamiltonian. The quality of structural predictions is assessed by validation of lattice parameters and densities from X-ray data, which is common in molecular simulations. In addition, IFF uses surface and cleavage energies from experimental measurements to ensure a reliable potential energy surface. Thereafter, hydration energies, adsorption energies, thermal, and mechanical properties can often be computed in quantitative agreement with measurements without further modifications. The parameters also have a physical-chemical interpretation and chemical analogy can be effectively used to derive parameters for chemically similar, yet unknown compounds in good accuracy. Alternative approaches based on random force field fitting to lattice parameters and mechanical properties (the 2nd derivative of the energy) lack interpretability and can cause over 500% errors in surface and interfacial energies, limiting the utility of models.  Current coverage  IFF covers metals, oxides, 2D materials, cement minerals, and organic compounds. The typical accuracy is ~0.5% for lattice parameters, ~5% for surface energies, and ~10% for elastic moduli, including documented variations for individual compounds. All-atom models and simulation inputs for bulk materials and interfaces can be built using Materials Studio, VMD, LAMMPS, CHARMM-GUI, as well as other editing programs. Simulations and analysis can be carried out using many molecular dynamics programs such as Discover, Forcite, LAMMPS, NAMD, GROMACS, and CHARMM. IFF uses employs the same potential energy function as other common force fields (CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, DREIDING, GROMOS, PCFF, COMPASS), including options for 12-6 and 9-6 Lennard-Jones potentials, and can be used standalone or as a plugin to these force fields to utilize existing parameters.  Applications  Accurate interatomic potentials are essential to analyze assemblies of atoms, molecules, and nanostructures up to the small microscale. IFF is used in molecular dynamics simulations of nanomaterials and biological interfaces. Structures up to ten thousands of atoms can be analyzed on a workstation, and up to a billion atoms using supercomputing. Examples include properties of metals and alloys, mineral- organic interfaces, protein- and DNA-nanomaterial interactions, earth and building materials, carbon nanostructures, batteries, and polymer composites. The simulations visualize atomically resolved processes and quantify relationships to macroscale properties that are elusive from experiments due to limitations in imaging and tracking of atoms. Modeling thereby complements experimental studies by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and tomography, such as transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, as well as several types of spectroscopy, calorimetry, and electrochemical measurements. Knowledge of the 3D atomic structures and dynamic changes over time is key to understanding the function of sensors, molecular signatures of diseases, and material properties. Computations with IFF can also be used to screen large numbers of hypothetical materials for guidance in synthesis and processing.  Surface model database  A database in IFF provides simulation-ready models of crystal structures and crystallographic surfaces of metals and minerals. Often, variable surface chemistry is important, such as in pH-responsive surfaces of silica, hydroxyapatite, and cement minerals. The model options in the database incorporate extensive experimental data, which can be selected and customized by users. For example, models for silica cover the flexible area density of silanol groups and siloxide groups according to data from differential thermal gravimetry, spectroscopy, zeta potentials, surface titration, and pK values. Similarly, hydroxyapatite minerals in bone and teeth displays surfaces that differ in dihydrogenphosphate versus monohydrogenphosphate content as a function of pH value. The surface chemistry is often as critical as good interatomic potentials to predict the dynamics of electrolyte interfaces, molecular recognition, and surface reactions.  Application to chemical reactions  IFF is primarily a classical potential with limited applicability to chemical reactions. Quantitative simulations of reactions is, however, a natural extension due to an interpretable representation of chemical bonding and electronic structure. Simulations of the relative activity of Pd nanoparticle catalysts in C-C Stille coupling, hydration reactions, and cis-trans isomerization reactions of azobenzene have been reported. A general pathway to simulate reactions are QM/MM simulations. Other pathways to implement reactions are user-defined changes in bond connectivity during the simulations, and use of a Morse potential instead of a harmonic bond potential to enable bond breaking in stress-strain simulations.

Early life and family  Helene Lovie Taylor was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1920, to Alexander and Helen Taylor (n√©e Trail). Her father was a salesman. She grew up in Footdee, and attended Ashley Road Primary School then Aberdeen Academy, and eventually won a scholarship to study French and English at the University of Aberdeen. Taylor married John Aldwinckle, an RAF flight lieutenant, in February 1945. They had four children: Richard, Linda, Pamela, and Lady Diana Browne. John Aldwinckle died in 2012.  Career  Helene joined Bletchley Park after completing a three year degree at Aberdeen University. She was recommended by Aberdeen University Principal William Hamilton Fyfe to the Foreign Office, in part because of her extraordinary memory and interest in languages. After two rounds of interviews with the Foreign Office in London and Aberdeen, Helene was selected by senior codebreaker Stuart Milner-Barry to become a permanent Foreign Office Civil Servant and was sent to live at Bletchley Park in the summer of 1942. During the first round of interviews, Aldwinckle was not aware of what she was being interviewed for, believing it to be a general civil service role. Helene was initially based in Registration Room 1 (RR1), where she worked on encrypted signals. She became responsible for leading a training programme for American service personnel in 1943. When the programme was complete, Helene went to work in Quiet Room (QR) in Hut 6, the section of Bletchley Park tasked with deciphering Enigma codes. There she brought the knowledge and skills she developed training American personnel to longer term and more complicated encryption problems, including identifying Enigma radio networks and radio signals. After the Second World War ended, Helene stayed for a short time at Bletchley Park to help write the history of the work of Hut 6 but she had to leave the Foreign Office in 1945 due to a policy that said women could not stay employed after marriage. Aldwinckle lived in Cologne and Berlin, accompanying her husband John in his role at MI6, moving initially in the 1950s. She worked for both the British Forces Network and as a cultural events reporter. She continued her interest in amateur dramatics (having been involved in her youth in Aberdeen) joining the Berlin Amateur Dramatic Society. She accompanied John on subsequent postings to France, Germany and Britain, and they also lived in Rome, Brussels, and Mons. Aldwinckle had a varied career post-Bletchley, becoming a translator for Thames and Hudson in 1967; and a gallerist at the Medici Gallery at the age of 54. She later worked at the Oxford Gallery, and in 1979 became the manager of the Medici.  Honours  Aldwinckle was awarded the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur in 2019. Theresa May thanked her, in May's final Prime Minister's Questions.

Planned and constructed as part of the WestConnex project, WestConnex tolls are applied to the motorway. It is currently the longest road tunnel in Australia. Construction of the motorway began in July 2016 and the first stage opened on 5 July 2020 at an estimated project cost of 4.335 billion. Future stages of the M8 Motorway will open in 2023 and after 2026, to connect with the A8 in the Northern Beaches via the M4‚ÄìM5 Link, Rozelle Interchange and Western Harbour Tunnel & Beaches Link. Route From its western end at , the route branches out of the M5 corridor and travels parallel to the M5 East. The route then curves to the north and runs parallel to Princes Highway before terminating at St Peters Interchange in , with further connections towards the Eastern Suburbs via Euston Road and Gardeners Road, and towards Sydney Airport via the proposed Sydney Gateway. The first completed section of the M8 does not have any intermediate exits. However, tunnel connections to the future M6 Motorway towards Southern Sydney and Wollongong have already been built.

HistoryNew M5= In 2009, the government released the M5 Transport Corridor Feasibility Study, which investigated strategic options for improving the M5 Motorway corridor. The study identified a preliminary preferred option, being the M5 East Duplication, consisted of duplicating the M5 East and construction of a new connection from the M5 East at Arncliffe to Euston Road, Qantas Drive and Gardeners Road. The strategic concept for the M5 East Duplication was placed on public exhibition between November 2009 and March 2010 for community and stakeholder feedback. Feedback received was used to further develop and refine the scheme. In 2012, the scheme become the King Georges Road Interchange Upgrade and New M5 projects, the second stage of WestConnex. The New M5 would consist of separate tunnels parallel to the M5 East tunnels. The New M5 had the potential to impact the critically endangered Cooks River/Castlereagh Ironbark ecological community and the green and golden bell frog, which are listed under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999. Environmental approval from the federal Minister for the Environment was granted on 11 July 2016 and construction commenced later that month.

It provided a political and territorial base for Free France and strengthened General de Gaulle's international position. It made a major contribution to the war effort by financing the French Resistance, by the contribution of its many soldiers to the Free French Forces, and by the military exploitation of its installations and territories. Because of its geographical location, Free French Africa offered a considerable asset to the Allies, favoring military operations out of Chad in the Western Desert Campaign in Egypt and Libya, as well as facilitating communications across the continent, thus giving British colonies the ability to communicate with each other.  Political base of Free France  De Gaulle arrives in Brazzaville, the capital. In the vast territory of Free French Africa, including French Equatorial Africa and French Cameroon, Charles de Gaulle was able to exercise full powers as head of Free France, on an equal footing with a head of state. After passing through Douala in Cameroon, and Chad, he arrived in Brazzaville on , which was already the seat of government both of French Congo, as well as of the regional government of French Equatorial Africa.

The strategic military situation of Free French Africa offered Free France and the Allies a vast support and communications base in the heart of Africa. As a result, air transport and other infrastructure were widely developed. Seven airports were renovated or built, including the Fort-Lamy and Pointe-Noire airports, completed in 1942. The Brazzaville to Beirut airline was put into service in . Allied air force planes arrived disassembled and packed in crates, were rebuilt at in the British Gold Coast colony, and transited through Chad, where they were able to stop at the new Fort Lamy airfield, before reaching the Middle East theatre of operations. Twenty thousand planes flew in or through Africa; 3,000 landed at Fort Lamy in 1942. Road infrastructure was also improved. New roads were built totaling 10,000kilometers. The main priorities were military, towards the operational fronts.

Gabon and French Congo produce oilseeds and wood. The population is quite large in Ubangi-Shari and Chad. The Congo‚ÄìOcean Railway provides transport to the port of Pointe-Noire. French Cameroon, which was not part of French Equatorial Africa, joined Free France at the end of August. It is comparatively richer, with considerable and varied production, including citrus, cocoa, wood palm and various other resources. Its demographic potential is also important, with already 2.4 million inhabitants in 1936.

Bullet holes still remain The Shi-gakk≈ç or Shigakk≈ç (; literally \\"Private school\\") was a system of military academies in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan during the early Meiji era (late 19th century). Created by Saig≈ç Takamori, the building of these school and the organization of a political clique inside its walls was a cause of the Satsuma Rebellion. Many officers involved in the rebellion on the side of the Satsuma Domain were graduates of the Shi-gakk≈ç. It was located in Shiroyama-ch≈ç, Kagoshima, on the site of the current National Hospital Organization Kagoshima Medical Center. History After Saig≈ç Takamori's resignation from government in 1873, he returned to his hometown of Kagoshima. In June 1874, Saig≈ç organized the Shi-gakk≈ç, private military schools for young samurai. There were three schools comprising the Shi-gakk≈ç - the \\"Childhood School\\", the \\"Gunner School\\" (referring to infantry), and the \\"Artillery School\\".Kotobank. What is the Shi-gakk≈ç?. From Encyclopedia of the World, Second Edition. Accessed 6-4-2020. In order to pay for the establishment of the \\"Childhood School\\", Saigo contributed 2,000 koku of rice, ≈åyama Tsunayoshi contributed 800 koku, Kirino Toshiaki contributed 200 koku, and ≈åkubo Toshimichi contributed 1,000 koku. The other two schools were paid for with money from the prefectural budget. Besides the main three schools, branch schools were established elsewhere in Kagoshima Prefecture.Kagoshima City. Shi-gakk≈ç Ruins. Accessed 8-5-2013. Archived version. From these schools, Saig≈ç started his own political society by lecturing his students on not only military tactics but his own reactionary political views, his ideas of a samurai elite guiding the masses, and his desire for Japanese expansion. His lieutenant, Kirino Toshiaki, published a study from the Shi-gakk≈ç calling for a Japanese invasion of Korea. In Otsu Junichiro's Dai Nihon Kensei-shi, the Shi-gakk≈ç \\"anticipated the use of military force in its attempts to change the government\\". It was also a \\"political organization opposing the government\\", though a school by name. According to those who theorize that the Shi-gakk≈ç was one of the foundations for a private samurai army, by 1876, most administrative positions of some note in Kagoshima were occupied by members of the Shi-gakk≈ç clique. To some, the Shi-gakk≈ç was seen as Saig≈ç's Kingdom (Saig≈ç ≈çkoku). According to Charles L. Yates, although Saig≈ç and his Shi-gakk≈ç were important in the Satsuma Rebellion itself, there is no indication that the role of the Shi-gakk≈ç was anything but symbolic. The militarization of Kagoshima was something that happened from 1869 to 1870, and Saig≈ç's return and the establishment of the Shi-gakk≈ç was purely the donning of a new name for anti-government samurai in Kagoshima. During the Satsuma Rebellion, members of the Shi-gakk≈ç played a large part in the Satsuma Domain's army. The Shi-gakk≈ç system's troops carried Snider-Enfield rifles, carbines, pistols and swords. They had two artillery units, using up most of the field guns available in Satsuma, including 28 5.28-pounder mountain guns, 2 15.84-pounder field guns, and 30 mortars. The troops numbered 12,000 men, split into 7 battalions. It is noted that these troops did not have logistical support, other than an allowance of 100 rounds of ammunition per soldier. Citing the alleged assassination plot on Saig≈ç, his expansionist ideas and some confused coercion and misunderstandings of Saig≈ç's political ideas, Shi-gakk≈ç system battalions of the Satsuma Army attempted to help Saig≈ç in launching the Satsuma Rebellion on February 15, 1877. By February 21, hostilities started, and by February 23 and 24, the Satsuma rebels began to lay siege to Kumamoto Castle, and some of the first major battles of the Satsuma Rebellion began. With Saig≈ç's defeat and death at the Battle of Shiroyama on 24 September 1877, the Shi-gakk≈ç system was disbanded. The site of the Shi-gakk≈ç has, since 1945, been the site of the National Hospital Organization Kagoshima Medical Center.

He was able to lend large sums of money and issue letters of credit needed by travellers abroad.

The attacks left two dead and injured three others. The attacks began on May 29, when a drive-by shooting occurred in front of a federal courthouse in Oakland, resulting in the death of a security officer contracted with the Federal Protective Service. Over a week later on June 6, Santa Cruz County sheriff's deputies were shot at and also attacked with improvised explosive devices; one of them died as a result. U.S. Air Force sergeant Steven Carrillo was arrested soon after the second attack. A second suspect, Robert Justus, surrendered to authorities five days later. The FBI indicated that Carrillo was associated with the boogaloo movement, a loosely organized American far-right extremist movement whose participants say they are preparing for a second civil war. Carrillo used the George Floyd protests as a cover to attack police officers, according to the FBI. A white van owned by Carrillo contained a ballistic vest with a patch bearing boogaloo symbolism. Carrillo is alleged to have written \\"boog\\" and the phrase \\"I became unreasonable\\" (a popular meme among boogaloo groups) in his own blood on the hood of a vehicle he hijacked. According to federal authorities, the suspects were motivated by the boogaloo movement's ideology, and allegedly intended to spread its extremist views and start a race war. AttacksOakland, California shooting= At around 9:44 pm on May 29, 2020, an initially unknown assailant (later identified as Carrillo) fired a rifle out of the sliding door of a white van, striking security personnel stationed outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building in Oakland, California. Two Triple Canopy security officers contracted with the Federal Protective Service were shot, resulting in the death of David Patrick Underwood and the serious injury of the other. The attack occurred during the George Floyd protests in California. Video surveillance later revealed that the van did not have license plates and had been in the area for at least half an hour. A man was seen exiting the driver's seat and walking around for 10 minutes before the attack. =Santa Cruz County, California attack= On June 6, 2020, Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Department deputies arrived at Carrillo's residence in Ben Lomond, California. In response, Carrillo allegedly fired at the deputies with an AR-15 style rifle, seriously injuring one deputy and killing Sheriff Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller. Two nearby California Highway Patrol officers responded to the scene, and were met with gunfire, wounding one officer. Deputies and officers were also attacked with improvised explosive devices. During the shootout, Carrillo was hit and fled on foot to a nearby highway where he hijacked a car. He abandoned the car minutes later. According to the criminal complaint against him, Carrillo scrawled messages in his own blood on the hijacked car that said \\"I became unreasonable\\", \\"stop the duopoly\\", and \\"Boog\\". Carrillo tried to take another car from where it was parked at a home, but was restrained by the homeowner and another civilian. Carrillo was arrested in connection with the attack. Suspects Steven Carrillo is a 32-year-old Air Force sergeant from Ben Lomond, California. He was on active duty at the Travis Air Force Base where he led the Phoenix Ravens, an elite unit tasked with guarding American military personnel at unsecure foreign airfields. He had worked at the base since 2018, though he had served in Kuwait for four months in 2019. A former friend of Carrillo's told ABC News that Carrillo identified as a libertarian. Robert A. Justus Jr. is a 30-year-old man from Millbrae, California. Investigation The FBI investigation of the Oakland shooting did not initially reveal a motive or a suspect. By June 2, investigators believed the attackers were targeting uniformed officers. An abandoned white van that held firearms, ammunition, and bomb-making equipment contained evidence that led to Carrillo's home in Ben Lomond. A ballistic vest found in the white van bore a patch with the boogaloo symbols of Hawaiian-style print and igloos. At his home he opened fire on officers, was shot in the process, fled on foot, and hijacked a nearby car. He was later found and arrested, bleeding from his hip. According to an official from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a homemade machine gun with a silencer was used in the shootings. The weapon was a \\"ghost gun\\" and did not have a serial number. Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli described the Oakland shooting as an \\"act of domestic terrorism\\". The FBI announced on June 16 that Steven Carrillo was associated with the boogaloo movement and that he and Justus had deliberately chosen the night of protests in Oakland for cover for the May 29 attack. The FBI agent- in-charge of the investigation stated, \\"There is no evidence that these men had any intention to join the demonstration in Oakland. They came to Oakland to kill cops.\\" Beforehand, Carrillo posted on Facebook, \\"Go to the riots and support our own cause. Show them the real targets\\" and \\"Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.\\" The attack took place several blocks from a protest at Oakland City Hall. A former friend of Carrillo's told interviewers, \\"Excessive use of force on unarmed civilians ‚Äî that was a huge thing for him... It was a mental tipping point for him.\\" The hijacked car had \\"boog\\", \\"I became unreasonable\\", and \\"stop the duopoly\\" written in Carrillo's blood on the vehicle's hood. \\"I became unreasonable\\" is a popular phrase in boogaloo memes, and is a quote from Marvin Heemeyer, the perpetrator of the 2004 \\"Killdozer\\" rampage in which he demolished several buildings over a zoning dispute. \\"Stop the duopoly\\" is also a popular fixation among boogaloo adherents, referring to the dominance of the Republican and Democratic parties in American politics. Authorities linked the crimes to the boogaloo movement and said the men used recent demonstrations against racial injustice as a cover to attack law enforcement. The FBI agent in charge of the investigation said in a news conference that the suspects did not appear to intend to join the protests, saying, \\"They came to Oakland to kill cops.\\" Using a search warrant, the FBI investigated posts from Carrillo's Facebook account posted between May 28 and 29. One message read, \\"It's on our coast now, this needs to be nationwide. It's a great opportunity to target the specialty soup bois.\\" (According to the FBI, \\"soup bois\\" may refer to federal law enforcement agents.) Another read, \\"Its kicking off now and if its not kicking off in your hood then start it. Show them the targets.\\" Justus was declared a suspect in the Oakland shooting and placed under FBI surveillance. He turned himself in at the federal building in San Francisco five days after Carrillo's arrest. Legal proceedings Carrillo was charged with 19 felonies, including murder and attempted murder. The charges carry lying in wait enhancements, making him eligible for the death penalty, though officials have not decided whether they will seek the death penalty in this case. Carrillo's lawyer has rebutted statements about Carrillo by law enforcement, and stated that Carrillo was \\"left deeply shaken\\" by the suicide of his wife in 2018. He also told the Santa Cruz Sentinel that Carrillo had experienced a traumatic brain injury in 2009. On August 27, 2020, Carrillo pled not guilty to the murder charge for the sergeant killed in Santa Cruz. Justus is facing charges of aiding and abetting murder and aiding abetting attempted murder. He has pled not guilty to the charges. Reaction Several conservative commentators inaccurately linked the Oakland shooting to the George Floyd protests that were occurring at the time. Media Matters for America, a left-wing organization that monitors right-wing media, characterized right-wing coverage of Underwood's death as an attempt to \\"discredit the wider Black Lives Matter protests\\". Fox News anchor Eric Shawn spoke of the George Floyd protests, saying \\"we have been under attack from domestic terrorists,\\" then reported Underwood's killing. Sean Hannity asserted Underwood was \\"murdered by rioters.\\" On June 1, President Donald Trump repeated the claim in a speech about the protests, saying, \\"A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protest. These are acts of domestic terror.\\" See also *2009 shootings of Oakland police officers *2013 shooting of Santa Cruz police officers *Right-wing terrorism References Category:2020 in California Category:2020 murders in the United States Category:2020s in Oakland, California Category:Alt-right Category:American police officers killed in the line of duty Category:Assassinated police officers Category:Anti-police violence in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2020 Category:Crimes in Oakland, California Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:Drive-by shootings Category:History of Santa Cruz County, California Category:Law enforcement in California Category:June 2020 crimes Category:June 2020 events in the United States Category:May 2020 crimes Category:May 2020 events in the United States Category:Spree shootings in the United States Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States in 2020 Category:Terrorist incidents in California ","title":"2020 boogaloo killings"},{"id":"64171736","text":"Abigail A.

(Saint-Pierre, Martinique, 28 June 1736 ‚Äî Paris, 2 January 1803),Acte d√©c√®s Etat civil reconstitu√© Paris () was a French navy officer. He is best known or discovering and exploring a new route between √éle de France (Mauritius) and French India. He was admitted as a member of the Acad√©mie de Marine in 1769.  Biography  Grenier was born to Ang√©lique Gabrielle and to Raymond de Grenier, a cavalry officer in the R√©giment de Berry who was given the rank of Frigate Lieutenant for services rendered at sea in American.Dictionnaire G√©n√©alogique, H√©raldique, Historique et Chronologique, vol. V, Chez Duchesne, Libraire, rue S. Jacques, 1761, (lire en ligne). Grenier started a career in the military during the Seven Years' War, and later during operations against the Sal√© Rovers. He joined the Navy as a Garde-Marine on 12 December 1755. On 1 November 1767, Grenier departed Brest as captain of the corvette Heure du Berger. When he arrived, the time was too far into the monsoon season to permit sailing to India, the governor of Isle de France sent him on a mission to Madagascar instead. On 12 August 1768, Grenier departed Port-Louis towards Foulepointe. He then hugged the Eastern coast, sailing South, and surveyed it up to Manansari river. The expedition was originally intended to continue to Fort Dauphin, but a lack of provisions made it impossible to complete the mission. Grenier nevertheless surveyed numerous natural harbours and rivers in the coast, and found sports suitable to establish slaving outposts. He even brought a tribe chief from Mahanoro to Isle de France. On 26 August, Grenier arrived at Foulepointe, and on 30 September, at Lake Nossibe. He departed Tamatave on 12 October to anchor at Manuru on 7 November. On 23, he arrived at Mananzary, where he stayed until 23. He then departed on 13 December to return Ile Bourbon (now R√©union), arriving on 23. Grenier finally returned to Port Louis on 11 January 1769. There, he authored a memorandum titled Projet d‚Äô√©tablissement √† Madagascar. In Spring, Grenier resumed his original mission. On 30 May 1769, he departed, along with Vert-Galant, under Commander La Fontaine, bound for Saint-Brandon, where he arrived on 2 June. He then sailed on the 5th Nazareth bank, then on Saya de Malha bank on 5 June, and continued North before sailing West to reach Seychelles, arriving at Mah√© on 14 June. He then sailed to Praslin, spending the night of 14 there, and departed on 15. He sailed through Maldives and arrived at Malabar coast on 29 July, and eventually at Pondich√©ry on 6 August. From there, Grenier sailed to Sumatra, arriving there on 9 September. He continued to Diego Garcia, where he arrived on 24, and returned to Port Louis on 6 October. Grenier's new route allowed a one-month journey to India, dramatically cutting on the three-month route then known, which made a large detour South before sailing North-West. Grenier was also the first to survey the Seychelles. Publication of the route yielded a polemic between Grenier and Rochon, but the Acad√©mie de Marine ended up backing Grenier, and later exploration by Kerguelen confirmed Grenier's findings. Grenier returned to France, where he arrived on 15 June 1770. In 1772, he sailed to Isle de France again on the frigate Belle Poule, along with Lap√©rouse and Saint-Haouen, and ferrying the new governor, Ternay. Grenier was promoted to Lieutenant during the journey, on 24 March 1772. In October 1772, Belle Poule sailed North through the Second Nazareth Bank, West of Gratia, before turning towards the Seychelles and arriving at Mah√©. She continued to Praslin, and then sailed to the Seven Brothers Islands, before arriving at Pondich√©ry and returning to Port-Louis. In July 1773, Grenier departed again, sailing West of the Nazareth Bank, East of Gratia and Praslin, before arriving at Pondich√©ry and Manila. He was back at Isle de France on 15 April 1774. Grenier was made a Knight in the Order of Saint Louis on 7 September 1776. At the outbreak of the Anglo-French War in 1778, Grenier was serving on the 64-gun Sphinx. He took part in the Battle of Ushant, and was then given command off Boudeuse, in the squadron under Estaing. On 22 January 1779, he captured the British corvette Weazle. He took part in the Battle of Grenada and in the Siege of Savannah in September 1779. In 1780, he was on convoy escort duty. Grenier was promoted to Captain on 9 May 1781, and served on Bretagne. He then worked on supplies for Guichen's squadron. Grnier retired from the Navy in 1789. He was a Freemason, member of the loge Saint-Jean d'√âcosse du Contrat social.

Among the contents of the presentation included the explanation of the position of the Malay Rulers, especially the Yang di- Pertuan Agong or King of Malaysia, and their role and positions as heads of the states and the supreme head of the federation respectively which shall be affected upon the signing of the Rome Statute. When the treaty is signed, the agreement has to be taken without any exclusion or reservations, which would open to tainting the sovereignty of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the Commander-in-Chief of the Malaysian Armed Forces, by allowing him to be brought to the International Criminal Court. The four academicians were mostly condemned by the government, including Port Dickson Member of Parliament and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) President, Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim who described the research and summary as a biased one. Deputy Minister of Education, Teo Nie Ching informed that the ministry shall discuss on the action to be taken against these four academicians, however, no action was taken after public condemnation.

Its deployment was attempted twice, once in 1940 and once in 1945. The former deployment was interrupted after the German victory in the Battle of France, and the latter deployment never came to full strength due to the imminent end of the war.  History  The assembly of the 273rd Infantry Division was ordered on 22 May 1940, along with the assemblies of the other divisions of the tenth Aufstellungswelle.The other divisions of the tenth wave included the 270th, 271st, 272nd, 276th, 277th, 278th, 279th, and 280th divisions. The 273rd Infantry Division was to be assembled by Wehrkreis III (Berlin), but its deployment, due to be completed by 1 July 1940, was cancelled after the Armistice of 22 June between Germany and France. While some of the other divisions of the tenth wave, all of which had seen their deployments cancelled in the same way as that of the 273rd Infantry Division, would be deployed at a later state in the war, the designation \\"273rd Infantry Division\\" was not used again. The planned structure of the 273rd Infantry Division included the three Infantry Regiments 544, 545, and 546, as well as the Artillery Detachment 273 and the Division Units 273, the latter including Panzerj√§ger, pioneer, and intelligence companies. While the 273rd Infantry Division itself initially did not see full redeployment, its subordinate regiments did. The three infantry regiments were deployed on 27 January 1942 at Milowitz military base, were redesignated Grenadier Regiments 544, 545, and 546 on 15 October 1942, and destroyed as part of the 389th Infantry Division at the Battle of Stalingrad between January and February 1943. They were subsequently reassembled under supervision of the 7th Army, sent back to the Eastern Front to fight in the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket and were eventually trapped at Danzig in 1945. In November 1943, the ordinal number 273 was used for the 273rd Reserve Panzer Division, which was active until March 1944. In April 1945, a second 273rd Infantry Division was deployed as one of the last desperate formations during the final stages of the war. It never reached the full strength of an infantry division. It was sent to the Eastern Front, where the heavily battered 16th Hungarian Infantry Division was attached to it. The 273rd Infantry Division ended the war in Czechoslovakia.

Demographics  From 2015 to 2016, Gallup polling reported that 8.6% of District of Columbia residents identified as LGBT, a higher percentage than any U.S. state. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that there were 6,935 same-sex households in Washington, D.C. in 2018, of which 61% were same-sex spouses. In 2017, 2.9% of all households were same-sex couple households. 77.4% of these households were male couples.  History  1950s and 1960s = Starting in 1950, in parallel to McCarthyism, the \\"Lavender Scare\\" resulted in the firing of thousands of government employees and contractors who were believed to be gay or lesbian, on the grounds of a tenuous perceived connection between homosexuality and espionage. Washington, D.C. vice squad lieutenant Roy Blick asserted to the Senate without evidence that there were 5,000 homosexual government employees. In 1961, following the Lander Scare, Frank Kameny and Jack Nichols founded the Washington chapter of the Mattachine Society, adapting tactics learned from the civil rights movement and organizing pickets at the White House, Pentagon, and State Department. = 1970s and 1980s = In 1970, activists from the civil rights movement, antiwar movement, and Black Panthers created the Gay Liberation Front-DC. The group staged public demonstrations and helped organize Washington's first gay pride in May 1972. The festival took place in Lafayette Park and at George Washington University and featured a dance, a drag show, and a religious celebration. In 1971, Kameny ran unsuccessfully in the 1971 District of Columbia's at-large congressional district special election. The Furies Collective, a lesbian feminist collective whose members included Rita Mae Brown and Joan E. Biren, pressured the National Organization for Women to accept lesbians in the early 1970s. A former member of the Gay Liberation Front-DC, Deacon Maccubbin, opened Lambda Rising in 1974. The now- defunct bookstore was one of the United States' largest gay bookstores and provided a space for other community groups. Maccubbin organized the first official DC gay pride in 1975. In 1979, students at Howard University created the Lambda Student Alliance, the first organization for LGBT students created at a historically black college or university. In October the same year, the National Third World Lesbian and Gay Conference took place at an unknown hotel near the university, coinciding with the first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. In 1982, James Tinney created Faith Temple to cater to LGBT Christians. The AIDS Memorial Quilt, originally created by Cleve Jones in response to the assassination of Harvey Milk was displayed on the National Mall in 1987. = 1990s and 2000s = The March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation in 1993 generated widespread attention and included a performance by Melissa Etheridge. The 1993 march was organized by Urvashi Vaid, the president of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. According to Joan E. Biren, this was the first time Jumbotrons were set up on the National Mall aside from government-organized events. = 2010s and 2020s = Rainbow Flag following the Supreme Court rulings legalizing same-sex marriage In 2015, following the U.S. Supreme Court rulings that states must recognize same-sex marriages, the White House was lit in with the colors of the Pride flag.

The two lakes were formed by receding glaciers, and now serves as a bird refuge.  Description  Both lakes were formed during the end of the last ice age, from runoff from the retreating Wisconsin glaciation. Silver Lake was among the lakes formed by this process. Of the two bodies, Silver Lake is larger. The smaller Lake Comegys was formed in the early 19th century when pollution from a local tannery sealed off a far end of Silver Lake, isolating the new body of water. Both lakes are notably close to the nearby Atlantic Ocean, and are considered to be the closest freshwater lakes to the Atlantic Ocean in the United States. The pair are also the only natural freshwater lakes in the state of Delaware. During the age of sail Silver Lake was used by passing ships to replenish their supply of fresh water. Lake Comegys in June 2020 Both lakes are fed by runoff and underground springs. In the 1920s the DuPont Company used dynamite to help drain sediment buildup in the lakes. In 1933, the state of Delaware established both lakes as state bird refuges. Delaware passed a resolution in 2004 declaring both lakes to be natural treasures of Delaware, citing the lakes' unique proximity to the Atlantic and their status as the only natural freshwater lakes in the state.

He became a professor of botany in 1833 and directed the botanical garden in Heidelberg from 1839. He specialized in the liverworts and mosses coining the terms archegonium and antheridium. The genus Bischofia was named after Gottlieb Wilhelm Bischoff by Karl Blume.

The missile was a potential delivery system that could have helped Iraq to deliver nuclear payloads. History Iraq had been planning to produce a liquid propelled surface-to-surface missile having a range of 1200-2000 km based on current scud technology. The Iraqis had started Project 144 for the production and modification of missile systems and designated it to the Al Qaya state establishment. The Iraqis also assigned project 1729 to Nassr State Enterprise, Research and Development Center, Taji-Baghdad. The Iraqis also started Project 1728 for indigenous scud engine development and production. Practical work on this missile however would not start until April 1989, according to Iraqi suggestions the nuclear capable version would not have been ready by 1993, two years after the first Iraqi nuclear weapon was to be produced. The Al-Tammuz missile program received a lot of help from foreign expertise especially from Brazilian scientist Major General Hugo de Oliveira Piva. Characteristics The missile was to be liquid propelled having a range of 1200-2000 km, a payload capacity of at least one ton and a range of 1200 to 2000 km. The engine of this surface-to-surface missile was to be based on the Second stage of Al-Abid LV Note that some sources also designate the al-Abid LV as Tammuz-2.

Biography Edmonds was born, raised, and went school in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Her grandfather was Rev. Samuel Harrison, the founder and first leader of Second Congregational Church. In 1908, she was the valedictorian for the class of 1908 at Pittsfield High School. During World War I, she was refused training as a nurse by a local Pittsfield hospital, House of Mercy. In 1917, she was able to enroll in a three-year nursing course at Lincoln Hospital and Home Training School for Nurses in New York City. After completing this course, Edmonds received a scholarship to study hospital social service from Columbia University. After graduating, Edmonds worked at Henry Street Settlement, a visiting nurses service. In 1922, Edmonds married William Bailey Edmonds and in 1926, they relocated to her hometown, Pittsfield. They had four children. After moving from New York City to Pittsfield, Edmonds did not try to find work because Pittsfield wasn't \\"ready for a black [registered] nurse.\\" During this time, she began to sew from home to help earn money for her family. In the 1940s, Edmonds sought work as a nurse and, during World War II, she taught home nursing classes for the American Red Cross. In 1945, she joined the Pittsfield Visiting Nurse Association. She acted as secretary for District One of the Massachusetts State Nurses Association. From 1956 to 1968, Edmonds served as a health coordinator and part-time instructor in home nursing at Pittsfield General Hospital. In 1962, Edmonds was named \\"Mother of the Year\\" by the Women's Club in Pittsfield. ReferencesExternal links *Florence Edmonds Interview Transcript, 1976-1981 OH-31.

However due to limited space in city centre, the hospital board sought out a new location for the hospital. In 1985, under Prem's cabinet as part of the Sixth National Social and Economic Development Plan, an agreement was made with the Royal Thai Army Fourth Army Area and Songkhla Provincial Administration to transfer a piece of land at the southern end of the Tinsulanonda Bridge for the construction of the new hospital.

It featured Irish rock band U2 as the performer. Using a heart-shaped stage replicated from their 2001 Elevation Tour, the band played three songs and paid tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks, which had occurred in the United States five months earlier. The show was produced by Clear Channel Entertainment, which also produced the band's Elevation Tour. Singer Janet Jackson was originally booked as the halftime performer, but after the September 11 attacks, it was decided that a different artist would be needed to set the tone required. U2 were selected as the replacement after several executives from the National Football League (NFL) attended one of their October 2001 concerts in New York City and were emotionally impacted by the band's tribute to the attack victims, whose names were projected across the ceiling of Madison Square Garden. During their halftime performance, the band played their 2000 hit single \\"Beautiful Day\\", the 1984 song \\"MLK\\", and their 1987 hit single \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". During the latter two songs, U2's tribute to the September 11 victims was reprised, as their names were projected onto a vertical scrim behind the stage and across the interior of the Superdome. At the end of the performance, lead singer Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining. The halftime show drew a 38.3 Nielsen rating and 82.9 million viewers in the US. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the band's performance and the poignancy of the 9/11 tribute. In the week following U2's performance, sales of their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind increased in the US by 142 percent. In 2006, U2 returned to the Superdome as the entertainment for another NFL game, performing with Green Day for the New Orleans Saints' first home game since Hurricane Katrina. Many critics have ranked the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime among the top Super Bowl halftime shows. Background U2's 2000 studio album All That You Can't Leave Behind was commercially and critically successful. It debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 10 million copies by December 2001. The record's lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit,McGee (2008), p. 220 and in February 2001 it won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. The band embarked on a concert tour, the Elevation Tour, in March 2001.McGee (2008), p. 228 The first two legs sold out all 83 concerts across North America and Europe and grossed US$105 million. On 10 September 2001, Clear Channel Entertainment (CCE) and SFX Entertainment announced a third leg of U2's Elevation Tour, consisting of a return trip to North America. Tickets for the shows were scheduled to go on sale on 15 September, but the day after the announcement, the September 11 attacks occurred in the United States;McGee (2008), p. 237 four passenger airliners were hijacked by al-Qaeda terrorists and crashed in New York City and near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. CCE and SFX postponed ticket sales out of respect for the tragedy. Many artists cancelled tours of North America altogether in the wake of the attacks, but on 17 September, CCE and SFX announced that the Elevation Tour would continue as planned and that tickets would go on sale for various shows starting 21 September. Following the attacks, All That You Can't Leave Behind found added resonance with American audiences,McCormick (2006), pp. 308‚Äì309 as the album climbed on the Billboard 200 chart and songs such as \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Peace on Earth\\" garnered radio airplay. Both tracks were performed during U2's appearance on the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon to benefit the attack victims.McGee (2008), p. 237 The Elevation Tour was the top-earning North American tour of 2001 with a gross of US$109.7 million, the second- highest ever at the time for a North American tour. Globally, it grossed US$143.5 million from 2.18 million tickets sold, making it the year's highest- grossing tour overall. U2 was named \\"Band of the Year\\" by the magazines Rolling Stone and Spin. As a result of the September 11 attacks, the National Football League (NFL) postponed its games scheduled for that week until the end of the 2001 regular season. To allow the playoffs to be held in their entirety, in October the NFL rescheduled Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome from 27 January 2002 to 3 February. Booking Jim Steeg, the executive of special events for the NFL, had the original entertainment lineup for Super Bowl XXXVI booked by August 2001. The billing would have featured performers from a diverse range of musical genres: Lionel Richie for \\"America the Beautiful\\", the Bee Gees and Creedence Clearwater Revival for a pregame performance, and Janet Jackson for the halftime show. However, after the September 11 attacks, Jackson cancelled the European leg of her All for You Tour and was not travelling, and she decided to pull out of the Super Bowl after realising her show would not fit the mood required. U2 performing on their 2001 Elevation Tour. The band was selected for the halftime show after NFL executives attended one of their concerts in New York City. NFL marketing executive John Collins was tasked with finding a replacement for the halftime show. On 25 October 2001, he attended a U2 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. During the band's performance of \\"One\\", a scrolling list of the names of the 9/11 victims appeared on screen. Collins overheard fans becoming emotional at that moment, and realised U2 would make an ideal replacement for the halftime show. In a meeting the following day, Collins and two other league officials who had attended the concert discussed its emotional nature and unanimously agreed with the idea of booking U2. NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said, \\"we certainly like the music, but we like the message that U2 carries, which is responsibility to others and a sense of freedom\\". Collins called Jimmy Iovine, chairman of Interscope Records and producer of U2's 1988 album Rattle and Hum, and pitched him on U2 recreating the same tribute at the Super Bowl. Iovine contacted lead singer Bono and conveyed the NFL's proposal to him. The following day, Bono met with several executives of the NFL, including Collins, Steeg, commissioner Paul Tagliabue, COO Roger Goodell, and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Bono was enthusiastic about the prospect of being involved in a Super Bowl halftime show and proposed an extravagant show that would incorporate elements of world music. Many were sceptical of the idea, and the NFL debated for several days whether to book U2. Some argued against an Irish act paying tribute to the victims of an American tragedy, while a television executive mentioned that a past U2 television special had drawn low ratings. Goodell was immediately on board with the idea of U2, and while Tagliabue was initially uncertain, he ultimately decided to forge ahead and book them. Greg Hagglund, vice president and executive producer of CCE, met with U2 in Las Vegas during a stop on their Elevation Tour to have a brainstorming session about the show. He said that Bono \\"had such a grasp of what he wanted and what we and the NFL felt was appropriate\\". On 27 November 2001, it was reported that E-Trade had reached an agreement with the NFL to sponsor the halftime show for the third consecutive year. The deal was reportedly worth more than US$3 million. On 30 November, the NFL announced that CCE had been selected to produce the halftime show, and on 2 December, the league announced that U2 would perform. Super Bowl XXXVI marked the first time that CCE was involved in a Super Bowl halftime show; previous ones had been produced by the television networks and, in the case of Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, MTV. U2 were the first international act to be the sole performer at the halftime show. McCarthy said: \\"For the halftime show we were looking for a band that would help capture and lift the spirit of America and the world. With U2 we found what we were looking for.\\" Regarding the show's content, he added: \\"This year, we're looking to make it more relevant and meaningful, rather than dropping a rock concert in the middle of a football game. We're looking to provide entertainment that's memorable and inspiring.\\" U2's booking was in line with the NFL recasting the Super Bowl entertainment under the theme \\"Heroes, Hope, and Homeland\\". McCarthy said, \\"With the events of September 11th, we've redefined and refocused the game presentation, and the theme is celebration and the human spirit and the values of freedom, and also to everyday heroes\\". U2 and other musical acts at the Super Bowl were unpaid for their performances, as the NFL covered only travel expenses and accommodations in New Orleans. An NFL insider said, \\"We would have paid U2, but they didn't want any money.\\" Promotion An NFL representative said one factor in the league's decision to select CCE to produce the halftime show was its ability to use its vast media holdings, which included 1,200 radio stations, to promote the event. To increase interest in the Super Bowl in the weeks preceding it, NFL Films re-shot the music videos for U2's songs \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\" and \\"Beautiful Day\\" to include football footage. The NFL and Fox both used U2's songs in television commercials advertising the 2001‚Äì02 NFL playoffs. Collins said that the league's and Interscope Records' objective was \\"to help make U2 synonymous with the NFL\\". America Online held a sweepstake contest to award a Super Bowl XXXVI trip package to one of its members and a guest. The package included access to the inside of U2's heart-shaped stage during their halftime performance. Preparations and rehearsals A few weeks before the game, a major production issue arose when organisers discovered they were unable to power the projectors that would scroll the victims' names across the domed ceiling of the Superdome. Collins was irate and demanded organisers resolve the problem, stating, \\"The only reason Paul Tagliabue approved this was because of the names going across the roof.\\" A generator was ultimately located, allowing the projection to proceed. Around 21 January 2002, production crews arrived at Tad Gormley Stadium at the University of New Orleans to work on the logistical aspects of the halftime show, particularly the process of building and disassembling the stage on the field in the mandated amount of time. After arriving in New Orleans on 30 January, the band rehearsed in the Superdome and participated in a 20-minute press conference that day. During rehearsals, it was debated whether to project the victims' names onto a scrim behind the stage or not;McGee (2008), pp. 243‚Äì245 the projection was not powerful enough to be seen across the ceiling. Ultimately, the scrim was adopted, but to some, the effect did not look good. After the Friday rehearsal just two days before the Super Bowl, one NFL executive remained cynical about the show's prospects, saying, \\"This is going to be the worst halftime show ever.\\" Show production CCE's Special Events Group in St. Louis was responsible for managing the timing and technical aspects of the show, as well as managing talent. Hagglund produced the performance and coordinated with the special events department. The NFL set financial and creative terms for the halftime show. Hagglund called it \\"the biggest special event we've ever done\\". CCE employed 45 full-time staff members to work on the halftime show, in addition to contractors, stagehands, and volunteers. The halftime show ran for 23 minutes; setup and disassembly of the stage on the field required five-to-six minutes each, leaving the band between 11‚Äì12 minutes to perform. Hagglund called it an \\"unbelievable challenge\\". Producer Dennis M. Despie oversaw the show from a location 200 feet above the stage. Sergeant Sam Dotson of the Metropolitan Police Department, City of St. Louis coordinated security for the halftime show. Jim McClellan served as a co- executive producer. Stage design and equipment The heart-shaped stage from U2's 2001 Elevation Tour (pictured) was replicated for their halftime performance. The stage, which featured a heart shape with an open center, was replicated from the one designed by Mark Fisher for the band's 2001 Elevation Tour. Between 2,000 and 3,000 winners of a Clear Channel radio promotion were selected to be on field for the performance, 400 of whom occupied the inside of the heart. The stage comprised 22 interlocking pieces varying in weight from ; in total, the stage weighed . The sections of the stage were wheeled onto the field by a team of 250 volunteers, who were split into groups of ten and blended in with the rest of the on-field audience after completing the stage assembly. The wheels of each stage segment had soft tires to avoid damaging the playing surface. The names of the 9/11 victims were projected by twelve 7-kilowatt xenon PIGI film projectors manufactured by E/T/C Audiovisuel and supplied by Fourth Phase Image Systems Group; they were the same type of projectors used during the band's Elevation Tour. The victims' names were projected across the interior of the Superdome, as well as onto a Kabuki scrim measuring high by wide. Willie Williams and Catherine Owens created the projections, while Brian Beasley operated the projectors. Much of the same lighting equipment from the Elevation Tour was used for the halftime show. In partnership with Williams, lighting directors Bob Dicksinon and Ted Wells used two lighting systems with luminaires by Vari-Lite. The one suspended above the stage featured 38 VL2416 fixtures, 24 VL5 fixtures, 210 VL5Arc fixtures, and 18 VL7 fixtures, and it was controlled by Victor Fable with a Virtuoso console. The lighting system at ground level comprised 30 VL2416 fixtures, 12 VL5 fixtures, and 30 VL5Arc fixtures, and was controlled by Willy McLachlan with a Virtuoso console. Bruce Ramus operated the lighting. U2's halftime set required three times more cabling and lighting than the previous three Super Bowls in New Orleans combined. ATK AudioTek Corp. coordinated the audio aspects of the show. Their JBL VerTec speaker system was suspended above the stage, while their portable V-DOSC cart speaker system was wheeled onto the field at ground level. All-digital mixing consoles were used, including a 48-channel InnovaSon Grand Live console that served as the front-of-house mixing station for all entertainment for the fans in attendance. James Stoffo of Orlando's Professional Wireless supplied the wireless microphone equipment, which consisted of ten Sennheiser SKM 5000 microphone/transmitter sets and two Sennheiser EM 1046 receiver units (each capable of eight channels). Stoffo, who had worked on seven prior Super Bowls, was responsible for managing issues related to RF interference; over 1,500 other frequencies were occupied on gameday, 300 of which were in the same frequency band as the SKM 5000 microphones. Performance synopsis Organisers said that most of the musical performers at Super Bowl XXXVI would pre-record their performances to reduce the possibility of technical problems. U2, however, said they intended to play live for the halftime show. When asked if he would lip sync, Bono said: \\"I'll be singing live. Call us old-fashioned, but I thought it might be novel. It might catch on with the kids.\\" A backing rhythm track accompanied the band's live performance as a precaution. Despie said it was required as a \\"technical protection\\" against \\"the risk of a show going down\\". An Associated Press report published days before the Super Bowl claimed that the band would perform \\"Walk On\\". It was confirmed that the band would perform three songs, but they did not announce in advance which ones. The websites for U2 and the NFL stated that they would play at least one of the tracks \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", \\"Desire\\", \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", or \\"Beautiful Day\\". U2 lead singer Bono in July 2001 The on-field audience held light sticks. The show began with U2 performing their 2000 hit single \\"Beautiful Day\\". For the first verse, Bono walked with a cameraman through the on-field crowd to reach the stage. While doing so, fans started slapping Bono on the back. Realising the wires for his in-ear monitors were exposed, he began to panic. He said: \\"All one person has to do is pull the wire, and I'm off air. I would hear nothing. Off the air in front of a billion people!\\" Bono commented on his smirking facial expression, saying that it was a reflection of his fear at that moment,McCormick (2006), p. 309 but that he was \\"swaggering with the most annoying smirk ever seen. You just think: That guy is such a prat!\\"Assayas (2005), pp. 298‚Äì299 The band's second song was the elegiac \\"MLK\\", during which the scrim was raised behind the stage, onto which a scrolling list of names of the 9/11 victims were projected. This segment segued into the third and final song, the band's 1987 hit single \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\". Towards the end of the song, the scrim was released to the ground, and the names continued to scroll and be projected onto the interior of the Superdome. At the conclusion of the song, Bono opened his leather jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining. Reception U2's halftime show performance received generally positive reviews. Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe called it: \\"the greatest halftime show in the history of sporting events. Hands down.\\" John Smyntek of the Detroit Free Press rated U2's performance \\"Four stars all the way\\", saying that it \\"sure beat other recent Super Bowl halves that tried to telescope the wide world of pop\\". Phillip B. Wilson of The Indianapolis Star gave the halftime show a \\"B\\" rating and called it a \\"touching tribute\\" to the victims of September 11. Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant said that U2 was a \\"perfect fit\\" for the occasion, calling them \\"a group clearly used to big events, big crowds and big statements\\". He praised the decision to perform the uplifting \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" and Bono's revelation of the American flag in his jacket lining, saying it was \\"as if to demonstrate beneath his rock star exterior, he's with his U.S. fans on this most American of days\\". Tom Shales of The Washington Post said of the band's tribute to the 9/11 victims, \\"To some, it may have seemed rather a garish memorial, but in a strangely affecting way, it worked, and respectfully.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle said: \\"The real deal was an inspired bit of rock from U2 as the halftime entertainment. Here's a quick pop quiz: Has the halftime show ever been good? Ever? Pencils down. Correct answer: Not in our lifetime. And yet, U2's live breath of fresh air and dramatic, emotional spectacle that paid homage to the victims of Sept. 11 was both daringly bombastic and also pretty damn cool.\\" David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said that the halftime show \\"managed to strike the right mood of patriotism, pride and solemnity.\\" He added: \\"It was theater, yes ‚Äì but on a grand scale. Given the occasion, it was grand indeed.\\" Peter King of CNN/SI called the band's performance \\"perfect for the occasion\\" and said, \\"I praise you, NFL, selfishly, for giving me 11 terrific minutes at halftime of a great event\\". Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News said: \\"Many Roman numerals down the road, I'll still remember those shimmering moments when the banner dropped, U2 played loud, live and intimate, and the names of those lost in the Sept. 11 attacks glowed in the dark, lit by spotlights and projected onto the crowd.\\" Ed Bark of The Dallas Morning News called the performance \\"electrifying\\" and said about the tribute, \\"The roaring crowd reaction dwarfed anything produced by the game itself until the Patriots' thrilling victory on a last-second field goal.\\" Hal Boedeker of The Orlando Sentinel praised the performance for being \\"thrilling\\" with \\"urgent, powerful renditions\\" of the songs and for its tribute to the 9/11 victims. Boedeker said the halftime show \\"elevated the patriotic Fox broadcast\\" and was \\"mercifully simpler than the usually overproduced halftimes\\". Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch called the show an \\"unqualified success\\" and U2's performance \\"crowd-rousing\\". He said, \\"when you have U2 as your headliner and only act, you've got a guaranteed winner on your hands\\". Despite scepticism about U2's decision to play the Super Bowl halftime show, Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said: \\"Once U2 took the makeshift stage, all my compunctions vanished. The three-song mini-set was nothing us fans hadn't seen before, but somehow, sharing it with the rest of America... made the moment more galvanizing, familiar or not.\\" Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times said that the Fear Factor counterprogramming \\"couldn't have been any more bloated or exploitative than U2's oddly out-of-place halftime performance\\". He said the fault did not lie with U2 themselves but that \\"it nevertheless seemed odd: An Irish band singing about transcending society's oppressive values before a list of people killed in America's most devastating attack\\". Ed Sherman of the Chicago Tribune criticised the halftime show for not paying enough reverence to the 9/11 victims when displaying their names, saying: \\"Instead U2 played to a screaming crowd that was bouncing up and down, completely oblivious to the banner memorializing the dead. That should have been a solemn moment, not the background for a rock show.\\" Commercial impact The Super Bowl was expected to draw 130 million viewers in the United States and 800 million worldwide. According to \\"fast national\\" Nielsen ratings, U2's halftime show drew a 38.3 rating, equating to 40.2 million households and 82.9 million viewers in the United States. The performance lost only 4.4 percent of viewers from the previous half hour of the football game. In a counterprogramming move against the halftime show, NBC aired an episode of Fear Factor featuring Playboy Playmates; it drew only a 5.6 rating, equating to 5.9 million households and 11.4 million viewers. In the week following U2's Super Bowl performance, All That You Can't Leave Behind sold 46,000 copies (a 142-percent increase) in the United States, and the album jumped in the Billboard 200 chart from number 66 to 25. Additionally, sales doubled for three of their older albums, which rose on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart: The Best of 1980‚Äì1990 reached number 2 after selling 14,000 units (a 154-percent increase); The Joshua Tree reached number 14 after selling 7,000 units (a 144-percent increase); and The Best of 1990‚Äì2000/The B-Sides reached number 35. USA Home Entertainment secured the rights to the video footage of U2's halftime show performance, and included it as a bonus feature in DVD copies of the official Patriots Super Bowl championship video; it was the first Super Bowl championship video to feature a halftime show. Legacy U2's performance is considered by critics to be one of the best Super Bowl halftime shows. Entertainment Weekly called it \\"probably the most moving Super Bowl halftime performance to date\\". BBC Music and Variety ranked it seventh-best, while CBSSports.com ranked it sixth-best. Thrillist ranked it the fourth-best halftime show, saying, \\"U2 delivered the kind of bald sentimentality that both attracts and repels legions of fans and detractors, though it's tough not to appreciate the raw power of the performance\\" during the tribute to the 9/11 victims. Jim Harrington of The Mercury News ranked it the second-best of the 21st century, while Billboard and Roisin O'Connor of The Independent ranked it second-best overall. Lisa Redmond NBC Sports ranked it number one, saying, \\"While other halftime shows may have been more entertaining, none of them have had as much meaning as this one.\\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone placed it at the top of his list, saying, \\"U2 created one of the truly great live-TV rock & roll moments of all time, up there with 'Bad' at Live Aid\\". He added: \\"Only U2 could have made this so grandiose, yet so emotionally direct. Grown men wept buckets. Every daft ambition U2 ever had, every lofty claim they ever made, they earned tonight.\\" Brian Mansfield of USA Today ranked it first, saying that U2 \\"gave a sentimental, cathartic performance that went from celebration to elegy and back... By embracing the nation's still-fresh pain, the band transcended the game, making the performance the only one that stands on its own as a cultural event.\\" Sean Merriman of Bleacher Report ranked it first, calling it \\"one of the most moving musical tributes of all time\\". Other publications such as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Sports Illustrated, and the NFL's own website also described or ranked it as the best Super Bowl halftime show. On the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, U2's halftime performance was re- aired on the NFL Total Access program on NFL Network. On 25 September 2006, U2 once again performed at the Superdome in New Orleans as part of entertainment for an NFL football game. For the New Orleans Saints' first home game back at the Superdome since Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, U2 and Green Day performed four songs during a pre-game show: Green Day's song \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\", a cover of the Skids' track \\"The Saints Are Coming\\", and U2's \\"Beautiful Day\\".

ConnectU.com lawsuit Divya Narendra, Cameron Winklevoss, and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of the social network ConnectU, filed a lawsuit against Facebook in September 2004. The lawsuit alleged that Zuckerberg had broken an oral contract to build the social-networking site, copied the idea,Malcom A. Glenn, \\"For Now, Facebook Foes Continue Fight Against Site\\", The Harvard Crimson, July 27, 2007 and used source code that they provided to Zuckerberg to create competing site Facebook. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. It named among the defendants ConnectU, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Divya Narendra, and Wayne Chang, founder of i2hub. The parties reached a settlement agreement in February 2008, for $20 million in cash and 1,253,326 Facebook shares. On August 26, 2010, The New York Times reported that Facebook shares were trading at $76 per share in the secondary market, putting the total settlement value now at close to $120 million. ConnectU filed another lawsuit against Facebook on March 11, 2008, attempting to rescind the settlement, claiming that Facebook, in settlement negotiations, had overstated the value of stock it was granting the ConnectU founders as part of the settlement. ConnectU argued that Facebook represented itself as being worth $15 billion at the time, due to the post-money valuation arising from Microsoft's purchase in 2007 of a 1.6% stake in Facebook for US $246 million. Facebook announced that valuation in a press release. However, Facebook subsequently performed an internal valuation that estimated a company value of $3.75 billion. ConnectU then fired the law firm Quinn Emanuel that had represented it in settlement discussions. Quinn Emanuel filed a $13 million lien against the settlement proceeds and ConnectU sued for malpractice. On August 25, 2010, an arbitration panel ruled that Quinn Emanuel had \\"earned its full contingency fee\\". It also found that Quinn Emanuel committed no malpractice. ConnectU's lawsuit against Facebook to quadruple its settlement remains ongoing. In January 2010, it was reported that i2hub founder Wayne Chang and The i2hub Organization launched a lawsuit against ConnectU and its founders, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, seeking 50% of the settlement. The complaint states \\"Through this litigation, Chang asserts his ownership interest in The Winklevoss Chang Group and ConnectU, including the settlement proceeds.\\" Lee Gesmer (of Gesmer Updegrove, LLP) posted the detailed 33-page complaint online. On April 12, 2011, a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that the Winklevoss brothers, whose fight over Facebook's origins was a major narrative arc of the film The Social Network, cannot back out of a settlement they signed with the company in 2008. Aaron Greenspan and houseSYSTEM Aaron Greenspan, a colleague of Mark Zuckerburg's at Harvard University and later creator of PlainSite, created a web portal as an undergraduate called houseSYSTEM that launched in August 2003. In 2006, two years after the launching of thefacebook.com, Greenspan claimed in an open letter to Zuckerberg that Facebook used features that originally belonged to houseSYSTEM. Regarding Greenspan's allegations, years later Zuckerberg was described in The New York Times as \\"saying through a spokeswoman that he was not sure how to respond\\". Greenspan later filed a Petition to Cancel the \\"Facebook\\" trademark at USPTO. Facebook, Inc. agreed to a formal settlement with Greenspan in late May 2009 and issued a press release, but the terms were not disclosed. 2009 class action lawsuit On November 17, 2009, Rebecca Swift, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, filed a class action lawsuit against Zynga Game Network Inc. and Facebook, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for violation of the Unfair competition law and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and for unjust enrichment. Paul Ceglia On June 30, 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, New York, filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84% ownership of Facebook as well as additional monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that for an initial fee of $1,000, entitles Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as additional 1% interest per each day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor of Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. Facebook management has dismissed the lawsuit as \\"completely frivolous\\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt issued a statement indicating that the counsel for Ceglia had unsuccessfully attempted to seek an out-of- court settlement. In an interview to ABC World News, Zuckerberg stated he is confident of never signing such an agreement. At the time, Zuckerberg worked for Ceglia as a code developer on a project named \\"StreetFax\\". Judge Thomas Brown of Allegany Court issued a restraining order on all financial transfers concerning ownership of Facebook until further notice; in response, Facebook management successfully filed for the case to be moved to federal court. According to Facebook, the order does not affect their business but lacks legal basis. Young v. Facebook, Inc. In Young v. Facebook, Inc., plaintiff Karen Beth Young alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws on disability as well as breach of contract and negligence. A District Court judge dismissed the complaint, ruling that Facebook is a website, not a physical place, so the Americans with Disabilities Act does not apply. Lane v. Facebook, Inc. In March 2010, Judge Richard Seeborg issued an order approving the class settlement in Lane v. Facebook, Inc. This lawsuit charged that user's private information was being posted on Facebook without consent using Facebook's Beacon program. Fraley v. Facebook, Inc. Fraley v. Facebook, Inc. was a class-action case that alleged that Facebook had misappropriated users' names and likenesses in advertisements. The case settled in 2013, with checks to class members mailed in November 2016.

This species is named after its large aperture (lat.: bucculentus: having a large mouth). Description The species has a shell height of 1.8 mm and a shell width of 1.2 mm. The shell is greatly variable, taller and slenderer than those of its relatives. It is smooth, transparent and has a conic shape with approximately 5 slightly shouldered whorls, sometimes with an obtuse keel. The opening (aperture) is taller than wide, visible in the shells of the northernmost cave (Pivnica ≈°pilja), but hardly pronounced in shells from its other known locality, Jama na ≈†krilama. The peristome is roundish to oval, with a straight or rounded parietal shield, which is well-differentiated from the lip. The parientalis is present in the opening with varying prominence. The shell has a parietalis and a weak columellaris. The columellaris is completely absent in some of the examined individuals. Distribution This species is endemic to the northwestern part of the Karlovac region in Croatia. Genetic records are from three caves: Pivnica ≈°pilja, Jama na ≈†krilama and Vreliƒá ≈°pilja.

Radcliffe was born around 1550 in Elstow, Bedfordshire, one of four daughters and two sons of landowner and Member of Parliament Sir Humphrey Radcliffe and his wife Isabella Harvey. She became a maid of honour at court in 1564. In November 1565 she and the other maids were bought gowns of yellow satin with green velvet edges and chevrons, with silver lace, for the wedding of Ambrose, Earl of Warwick and Anne Russell. Similarly, in 1572 she and ten other maids and ladies of the chamber were given identical gowns made from crimson velvet, blue taffeta, with watchet blue silk lace.Janet Arnold, Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd (Leeds, 1988), pp. 99-100. As a lady of the privy chamber, Radcliffe was in charge of the queen's jewelry from 1587, in succession to Blanche Parry, and was usually described as \\"Mistress Mary Radcliffe.\\" In that year the jewel known as the \\"Three Brethren\\" was placed in her keeping. Radcliffe never married; she and Blanche Parry were the only gentlewomen attending Elizabeth I that shared the queen's famed virginity. Her name appears frequently in the lists of New Year's day gifts given to the queen, for taking receipt of jewels.Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth: 1596-1603, vol. 4 (Oxford, 2014), pp. 93-110.

In his younger years he was also one of Spain's first racing cyclists. Biography A historical Republican, he was a councilor in Bilbao at the beginning of the century and a provincial parliamentarian for Vizcaya in the 1910s. In 1918, he drafted a proposal for the autonomy statute for Biscay.La transici√≥n por la ‚ÄúConstituci√≥n Vascongada‚Äù (1852): De la‚Äù Constituci√≥n Foral‚Äù(1808) al ‚Äù Estatuto de la autonom√≠a de las regiones de √Ålava, Guip√∫zcoa y Vizcaya‚Äù(1919), by Joseba Agirreazkuenaga, Doctor of Contemporary History at Universidad del Pa√≠s Vasco. In 1929, Fatr√°s was one of the founders of the Biscayan wing of the Radical Socialist Party. In 1931 he was president of the Sociedad El Sitio de Bilbao, a member of the Biscayan executive committee of the Republican-Socialist Conjunction representing the radical socialists and candidate for Deputy for the Conjunction in the Spanish General elections of that year in Vizcaya. This was the only Basque-Navarre constituency where the Catholic-Fuerista Coalition did not win. As a result Fatr√°s obtained a deputy seat (just like Indalecio Prieto, Luis Araquist√°in and Ram√≥n Mar√≠a de Aldasoro).Los parlamentarios de los territorios vasco- navarros y la discusi√≥n de la Constituci√≥n republicana de 1931, by Jos√© Mar√≠a Gil Angulo, Espacio, Tiempo y Forma, Serie V, H¬™ Contempor√°nea, t. 13, 2000, pages 393-413. In the Cortes he starred in numerous confrontations against Basque traditionalists and nationalists. While he was in favor of a democratic Basque statute, he strongly opposed Estella's Statute, which he described as being supported by \\"clerical fanaticism.\\" In May 1933 in the Cortes he publicly accused the Basque Nationalist Party for being responsible for the events of Us√°nsolo (Biscay), in which radical socialists returning from a rally in Amorebieta and Basque nationalists got into a gunshot confrontation, resulting in the death of a woman and a child. Fatr√°s remained in the party after the departure of Marcelino Domingo's independents and was a candidate for the PRRS in the 1933 general elections, as well as for the provincial elections of Vizcaya, but did not get elected. He did not stand for the 1936 elections. Although he was originally from Bilbao, he owned a summer house in Miranda de Ebro. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War caught up with him there. Although he was not immediately arrested (on July 21 he received Ernesto Ercoreca, the Republican Mayor of Bilbao, who got trapped in Miranda when the railway line was cut on his way back from Madrid) Dep√≥sito Legal: BU-182-2000, Fatr√°s was eventually taken from his house by Franco's Nationalist rebels. They subsequently informed his wife that he had been shot, without it being known where or where his remains lie, and afterwards his family was expropiated of all his property.  Cycling career  In the early years of Spanish cycling, before 1900, Fatr√°s was a well known rider. He was successful especially in his home region of Bilbao. ;1893 : 1st Bilbao - San Sebasti√°n : 3rd Bilbao - Balmaseda - Bilbao ;1894 : 1st Bilbao - Balmaseda - Bilbao  See also  * Partido Republicano Radical Socialista  References  Bibliography  *  External links  *Profile at Congreso de los Diputados. * * Category:1872 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Basque politicians Category:Radical Socialist Republican Party politicians Category:Members of the Congress of Deputies of the Second Spanish Republic Category:Spanish male cyclists Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (Republican faction) ","title":"Vicente Fatr√°s"},{"id":"64173071","text":"Thomas Adderley was an Irish politician.

Origins  Robert was born in 1180, and was a minor knight who held two knighthood fiefs in Burgate, Suffolk. By 1205, the barony Honour of Eye was in the hands of the King John's half-brother William Longesp√©e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury. That year, Robert and his squire William Talbot made a pledge of surety for the earl of two casks of wine. Robert was probably able to use his association with the Earl of Longsword as a stepping stone to the royal court.  Career and family  In 1208, Robert acquired the Honour of Eye (presumably as an administrator) through his service to the royal household. Closely associated with the earl, he was frequently mentioned in documents.. Robert was responsible for collecting the earl's monetary payment (known as a money fief) from the exchequer in 1210, and the earl was one of the men who vouched for Robert's ability to pay the 700 marks for his marriage to Gallena Dammartin. The king's half-brother, the Earl of Longsword's word carried weight; his decision to vouch for Robert implies that they were close. By 1210, Robert helped the king pay imprests (petty cash) and wages for troops for the campaign in Ireland. Although he held a significant amount of land in Suffolk, he gained additional property there through his wife. Robert was also known to have had acquired several manors and estates for his service to the crown; during his career, he acquired the great house of Wascheth in Oxfordshire and the manor of Daventry. Robert was the king's paymaster and commander of his sergeants in 1213, and was ordered to prepare for an expected French invasion. He was often employed to handle the king's financial matters. Robert was appointed castellan of Dover Castle from 1211 to 1213, although William Talbot may have been the de facto castellan. Around 1215, he became part of a diplomatic mission to Otto of Brunswick. In 1216, Robert and fellow knights Engelram de Furnet and Gilbert de Sanes were given custody of Framlingham Castle (a confiscated rebel castle). He was ordered to return to the king's side, leaving the other two knights to manage the castle (presumably because Robert was one of the king's closest men). At some point in King John's reign, Robert was custodian of the archbishop of York and of the castle and Honour of Knaresborough during Brian de Lisle's brief estrangement from the king. Robert married Gallena Dammartin Brewern, widow of John Brewer and heir of William de Dammartin, and they had three sons. He died in 1220, at age 40.

Built during the Liao dynasty, the tower is octagonal in shape and contains 7 floors, and was an important feature of the city of Fengzhou. In the late Yuan dynasty the city was destroyed and the tower was badly damaged, though it has since been repaired to its original state. In 1982, it was listed as a protected cultural site at the national level, the highest level of protection awarded to important historic and cultural sites in China. History Wanbu Huayanjing Pagoda (Baita Pagoda) in 1942 The Wanbu Huayanjing Pagoda was built in the ancient city of Fengzhou () during the Liao dynasty; though the exact date is unknown. Most sources suggest that the tower was likely complete during the reign of Emperor Daozong of Liao (1055-1110), an era in which a large number of temples and pagodas were built nationwide across the Liao dynasty. When the tower was first complete, it was coated with a chalk-based clay, leading to a bright white exterior . It is from this unique coating that the tower received its common name; 'Baita', or 'White Pagoda', a name that is still used today and can be seen in the name of Hohhot's airport, Hohhot Baita International Airport, and the protected cultural site Baita railway station. The tower was renovated in 1162 during the Jin dynasty era , and later repairs were made throughout the Yuan and Qing dynasties. During the destruction of the city of Fengzhou, in the late Yuan dynasty, the tower was heavily damaged, and the top of the tower was completely destroyed; though over time, it has been restored to its original state. In February 1982, Baita was named as one of the 62 important historical and cultural buildings to receive protection by the National Cultural Heritage Administration as part of the 2nd batch of Major Historical and Cultural Sites  Structure  Wanbu Huayanjing Pagoda stands at a height 55m, with a diameter of 18m and is located entirely within the site of a former Buddhist monastery in modern day Baita Village (); 20km east of Hohhot. The structure is primarily made up of bricks and white lime paste, with a large number of wooden arches supporting the structure internally. A winding staircase connects all 7 floors, with natural light allowed to penetrate through ventilation holes located throughout the perimeter of the structure. The base of the structure is designed to resemble a lotus flower, with the next 2 floors containing carvings of Bodhisattva; the remaining 4 floors contain no carvings. The first, third, fifth and seventh floors contain real doors facing east and west, with fake doors facing north and south. This pattern is reversed on the second, fourth and sixth floors. The interior of the pagoda contains 6 stone tablets from the Jin era, containing details information about the city of Fengzhou; and more than 200 carvings from travellers dating back as far as 1172. These carvings display an array of languages, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Khitan, Jurchen, Persian and ancient Syrian .

The name of the Hobart Nature District was officially established by resolution of the Common Council of the City of Hobart, Indiana on July 19, 2017, but the natural areas within the district have been in various states of accessibility and restoration for decades. The resolution by the City Council affirmed the phrase \\"Hobart Nature District\\" was the best way to refer to all of the areas contained within the Hobart Marsh Plan which was established by the city in 2013. The concept behind the Hobart Marsh Plan, which contains the areas now referred to as the Hobart Nature District, has been to capitalize on the extensive areas of native prairie, wetlands and woodlands creating a unique attraction for passive recreation enabling visitors the opportunity to experience local flora and fauna. The Hobart Marsh Plan has sought to connect numerous conservation lands managed by various local partner organizations. It also builds upon the growing regional bike trail network with the potential to become an eco-tourism destination, providing access to many other natural and cultural attractions in the region. While the phrasing \\"Hobart Nature District\\" only became official as of 2017, following the amendment of the Comprehensive Plan for the City of Hobart to include the Hobart Marsh Plan in 2013, conservation efforts and the early steps toward establishment of natural areas within the district date back to as early as 1989 when official support first began to formulate for the preservation of these special places. That initial support led to the establishment of the \\"Hobart Prairie Grove\\" that was added to the National Park System as part of a 1992 expansion of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (renamed the Indiana Dunes National Park in 2019).  History  1980s = 1989 * Hobart Mayor Margaret Kuchta testified in support of adding the Hobart Prairie Grove as a part of the National Park system during hearings on a bill submitted by Congressman Pete Visclosky in 1989. The Hobart City Council also passed a resolution endorsing the proposal. * David Canright of the Sierra Club Hoosier Chapter presented written testimony dated September 27, 1989 to the Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands, National Parks, and Forests in support of S.2882, a Bill to Enhance The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, that cites the importance of including Hobart Prairie Grove in the expansion. = 1990s = 1990 * Hobart Mayor Margaret Kuchta sent a letter to Senator Dale Bumpers, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and signed a proclamation on September 5, 1990 from the Office of the Mayor in support of the Hobart Prairie Grove. The proclamation phrasing noted the Hobart Prairie Grove as a \\"unique area containing rare and threatened or endangered species\\" and \\"preservation of this beautiful natural area will add an important cultural resource to enhance the strength and value of the Hobart community.\\" It further noted, \\"members of the City Council of Hobart, Indiana are in favor of including the Hobart Prairie Grove in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore\\" and proclaimed the City of Hobart's \\"support of the Hobart Prairie Grove in the Dunes National Lakeshore expansion bill.\\" *Senator Dan Coats spoke and submitted a prepared statement in the United States Senate during the second session of the 101st Congress where he noted the significance of the Hobart Prairie Grove as one of the \\"few remaining unspoiled prairie forests in the midwest\\" containing rare plants and wildlife. *A letter of support was written by local ecologist Sandy O'Brien to be included as part of the record of testimony on S 2882, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Access and Enhancement Act. The letter was addressed to the Honorable Dale Bumpers, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands, National Parks and Forests as part of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The letter provided detailed information relating the geological relationship to the dunes, the ecological quality, and plant diversity found at the Hobart Prairie Grove. *A letter of support was written by Kim Klimek, president of the Deep River Nature Society, to be included as part of the record of testimony on S 2882, the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Access and Enhancement Act. In the letter she noted the Hobart Prairie Grove was of National Park Service quality, having been surveyed by several botanists including Dr. Gerould Wilhelm who had done major botanical surveys of all the Lakeshore units and John Bacone, Director of Indiana's Department of Natural Resources. The Hobart Prairie Grove was noted as being the largest and best tallgrass savanna remnant in Indiana and the last chance to preserve the natural heritage according to experts. It letter also noted adjacent wetlands were evaluated by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and rated in the 1979 Technical Report No. 303 as #1 priority for acquisition in the Lake Michigan watershed. 1991 * Legislation sponsored by Congressman Pete Visclosky was approved by the U.S. House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs that would expand the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The legislation would direct the National Park Service to purchase 11 tracts of land in Lake, Laporte, and Porter counties, including the acres known as Hobart Prairie in Hobart. *Indiana Senators Richard Lugar and Dan Coats introduce a bill to expand the Indiana National Lakeshore which include the Hobart Prairie Grove. *An Indiana Dunes Coalition newsletter described the Hobart Prairie Grove as tallgrass savanna that was once common to the area but now so rare it was thought to be extinct. 1992 * Congress passed Public Law 102-430 adding Hobart Prairie Grove to the National Park System as part of a 1992 expansion of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (renamed the Indiana Dunes National Park in 2019). 1997 * On January 27, 1997 Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon signed the Articles of Dedication for the McCloskey's Burr Oak Savanna Nature Preserve. * The General Management Plan published by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore indicates the Hobart Prairie Grove is primarily a black soil savanna with significant acreage of prairie and wetlands. It also notes a section of abandoned Elgin Joliet and Eastern Railroad right-of-way is being developed as a hike/bike trail by the Lake County Parks Department that could provide access to the site with minimal impact. = 2000s = 2004 * The Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit conservation organization, announced that 219 acres of farmland would be restored to its condition prior to the arrival of the first settlers in Northwest Indiana. This includes 46 acres next to the Hobart Prairie Grove and 173 acres of adjoining farmland and burr oak groves that add to the existing public land in and around the Hobart Marsh region. 2005 * The Trust for Public Land announced their multi-year project to protect and save nearly 400 acres in and around Hobart was complete. The area known as Hobart Marsh was a result of a long-term cooperative effort that involved Congressman Pete Visclosky, the Trust for Public Land, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Indiana Department of national Resources, the Little Calumet River Basin Development Commission, local officials and local conservation leaders. * Parts of the Hobart Prairie Grove located within the Hobart Marsh area were described as an overgrown oak savanna and as an early successional mesic forest containing maple hickory and oak by publication detailing the Fire Management Plan for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. 2006 * Field notes from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service note that some tracts within the area known as the Hobart Marsh contain trees that may date back 200 years. 2009 * Robinson Lake Park, owned by the City of Hobart and located near the center of the Hobart Marsh Area, became the focus of public attention when a private developer sought to acquire the Robinson Lake Park property from the city. A grassroots efforts among community members opposing any sale of the park property formed a non-profit group known as The Friends of Robinson Lake with the mission is to preserve the natural beauty of the park, protect it as a public park, and promote awareness of park activities. The developer ultimately did not seek further action with regard to acquiring the park from the city citing negative response from city officials and also cited influence by the citizens group the Friends of Robinson Lake for their continued protest to the private ownership of Robinson Lake. * A September 2009 National Park Service Vegetation Inventory Program of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore included descriptions of the Hobart Prairie Grove which is located with the Hobart Marsh area of Hobart, Indiana. The report noted Hobart Prairie Grove provides a small remnant bluff prairie, and mostly a mosaic of oak savanna, woodland, and forest. = 2010s = 2011 * The City of Hobart identified a need to develop a plan for the area on the west side of the city where numerous organizations including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, City of Hobart, Indiana Department of Natural Resources, NIPSCO, and Shirley Heinze Land Trust, own and manage conservation lands. With the need established the City was able to secure a grant from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources Lake Michigan Costal Program to create a comprehensive plan and implementation strategy that would be known as the Hobart Marsh Area Plan. The project cost for development of the plan was $22,920 ($11460 Lake Michigan Costal Grant/$11,460 Local Match). *The City of Hobart Parks and Recreation Department published their Master Plan in 2011 and mentioned Robinson Lake Park and its importance in relation to hundreds of acres owned by the Indiana Department of National Resources within the area that had commonly been referred to as the Hobart Marsh. The Master Plan noted, \\"Robinson Lake is in the epicenter of 355 acres of DNR property. The property will be commencing wetland remediation in 2011 forward. The Planning Department is in the process of securing a grant that will study and formalize a plan for this sub-area of the city, with Robinson Lake being the focus.\\" The Master Plan further noted among long-range plan relating to the assessment of needs for City of Hobart Parks and Recreation through the year 2020 should include, \\"Consider purchasing additional property north of Robinson Lake for future development.\\" *The Long-range Interpretive Plan published by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in March 2011 indicated the Hobart Prairie Grove, located within the Hobart Marsh area, was one of several sites with almost no visitor amenities and little interpretation. The report targeted mid-term 2014-2016 goal tasks to include enhancing interpretive signage at Hobart Prairie Grove to include restoration progress with other interpretive content. 2012 * The Hobart Prairie Grove, located in the Hobart Marsh area, was included in a study by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore with details published in the Final White-Tailed Deer Management Plan / Environmental Impact Statement. * The City of Hobart Parks Department entered into an agreement in 2012 with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to manage the fish population in Robinson Lake located at Robinson Lake Park which is centrally located within the area known as Hobart Marsh. The state agency does periodic stocking and makes recommendations concerning the lake at no cost to the city. * Fifth grade students from Ridge View Elementary School in Hobart, Indiana work with Shirley Heinze Land Trust at the Greiner Nature Preserve within the Hobart Marsh Area as part of the Might Acorns Program to collect seeds from native species for future planting. 2013 * Shirley Heinze Land Trust organized a volunteer work day at their Bur Oak Woods nature preserve within the Hobart Marsh Area as part of ongoing efforts for more than five years of restoration work at the site. The 84-acre remnant bur oak savana is noted as being one of the rarest habitat types found in Indiana. Some of the trees are more than four feet in diameter and among some of the only remaining old growth trees in Lake County, Indiana. * The final version Hobart Marsh Plan was presented to the Common Council of the City of Hobart, Indiana for consideration. Among the intentions noted were for it to contain hiking and biking trails, trail heads and gateways. The Hobart Marsh Plan project was funded in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and was administered by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Lake Michigan Coastal Program. *The Comprehensive Plan of the City of Hobart was amended to include the Hobart Marsh Plan by resolution of the Common Council of the City of Hobart, Indiana. *Natural areas within the Hobart Marsh Neighborhood Groups were studied and published in the \\"Hobart Sustainable Neighborhoods: Environmental / Ecological Sub Plan\\" which was made possible in part by grant funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Lake Michigan Coastal Program. The publication focused solely on the ecology portion of sustainability and sought to identify and set benchmarks for environmental considerations within Hobart. The report summarized tree canopy coverage, impervious surfaces, land coverage and open spaces, and managed lands, parks, trails, and recreational facilities were among topics that are found throughout the City of Hobart, including areas within the Hobart Marsh Plan. 2014 * The non-profit group Friends of Robinson Lake host their 3rd annual paddling event with cooperation from the Northwest Indiana Paddling Association providing beginning paddlers an opportunity to experience canoeing and kayaking with loaner boats available at Robinson Lake, centrally located within the Hobart Marsh area. * The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore hosted a Hobart Prairie Bike Program, a 2 hour guided bike ride on the trail within the Hobart Marsh area hosted by a National Park Service park ranger. 2015 * Members of the City of Hobart Plan Commission participating in a panel discussion sponsored by the Legacy Foundation's Neighborhood Spotlight program noted that a large area in the Northwest part of the city is wetland and poised to become a center of recreational activity under the Hobart Marsh Plan. * Approximately 400 catfish ranging in size from 11 to 14 inches were released into the 16-acre Robinson Lake by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. *The Legacy Foundation's Neighborhood Spotlight program presented initial findings in a Kickoff Report that included numerous positive references to the abundance of natural areas that exist in and around the northwest areas of Hobart that include many of the natural areas within the Hobart Marsh Plan. The comments from the community were collected from 189 one-on-one interviews and 7 group interviews as part of a community SWOT analysis of Hobart's northwest side. *The Neighborhood Spotlight program in Hobart, sponsored by the Legacy Foundation, awarded grant money to help brand the area's nature preserves. Four grants for $370 each purchased signs and posts to identify three nature preserves in the Spotlight area that are also within the Hobart Marsh Plan. The recipients awarded for the signs were Woodland Savanna Land Conservancy for its Levan Wetland Nature Preserve, Shirley Heinze Land Trust (2 signs) for its Greiner Nature Preserve, and Save the Dunes Conservation Fund for its 11-acre Prairie Nature Preserve. *Save the Dunes acquired nearly 100 acres in the City of Hobart, Indiana and is significant because 35 acres of the property lie inside the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore official boundary, a piece that is within their Hobart Prairie Grove Unit. With the land acquired by Save the Dunes, it will be donated to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in the future. 2016 * City of Hobart hosts the Hobart Marsh Summit at the Festival Park Community Center in Hobart. Representatives from various conservation and government groups met to share updates on the work they have been doing on the properties they manage within the Hobart Marsh area.

The kingdom had trading relations with the Ayyubid and Tang dynasties. It also established its own currency and calendar. Recent excavations indicated consumption of wild pigs were prevalent in Harla as opposed to in neighboring Kingdom of Aksum. The excavations were done by the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies of the University of Exeter as part of the Becoming Muslim project at the urban sites of Harlaa in 2017-2019, Harar in 2014-2018, and Ganda Harla 2014, located in the eastern part of Ethiopia where substantial assemblages of faunal remains were recovered. The Harlaa archaeological site is located 40 km north-west of Harar and 15 km southeast of Dire Dawa and is the ‚ÄòHarla‚Äô stone-built towns and funerary monuments whose origins are ascribed by the Oromo to a legendary ancient people of giant who occupied the region before the Oromo arrived in mid-16th century. Harlaa was a large urban centre covering an area of around 500m east to west and 900m north to south excluding outlying cemeteries. It was composed of several elements including a central settlement area, workshops, three early mosques, wells, lengths of fortification wall, and cemeteries to the north, east, and west. Harlaa predates both Harar and Ganda Harlaa and provided the longest chronology with dates spanning between the mid-6th and early 15th century. The Harar site is situated in the Somali Plateau in a more heavily vegetated landscape and has an area of 1000√ó800m and at its core the Harar historic city which is surrounded by a wall and is accessed by five gates. The excavations indicated that occupation in Harar postdated the 15th century and that the city and its mosques were linked with the establishment of Harar as the capital of the Sultanate of Adal. The Ganda Harla is an abandoned settlement located 12.5 km southeast of Harar on a hill west of the village of Sofi and is linked with the Harla in local tradition. The zooarchaeological data indicated the inhabitants were hunters of wild animals in open terrain and scrub hillsides with the exception of Kobus kob which are more commonly found at lower elevations such as in valleys and riverine grasslands. The locals also kept domesticated animals such cattle (Bos taurus/indicus), goat (Capra hircus), sheep, and transport livestock such as donkey, horse and camel. The excavations also uncovered significant evidence for manufacturing and participation in regional and international Red Sea and western Indian Ocean trade networks. The study concluded the inhabitants use of heavy knives and carcass dismemberment showed they had cultural commonalities with the Islamic world of Arabia, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Levant, and Iberia despite the lack of butchery discussions in zooarchaeological literature from the Islamic world and their non-observance of Islamic dietary laws.

Excavation  Lyttle inherited a 20-room property in the London borough of Hackney. In the mid sixties he dug out a wine cellar under his home. Having done so, he said that he had \\"found a taste for the thing\\" and kept on digging, for some forty years.Great London Eccentrics: The Mole Man Of Hackney, Londonist, August 2015. He created a network of tunnels, wide and narrow, on several levels. Tunnels led in all directions, some of them up to in length, and reaching as far down as the water table. One excavation connected with the Dalston Lane tunnel, and the railway line. Lyttle dumped the clay he dug up in his garden and sometimes in empty rooms of the house. At some time he stopped maintaining his house and the building fell into disrepair. Lyttle's work attracted complaints from neighbours when sinkholes began to appear in the pavement, and when water and power supplies were interrupted. The local pub also expressed concern that its cellar could collapse into one of Lyttle's tunnels. Serious complaints to Hackney Council may have started around the turn of the century, leading to inspections but at first not to firm actions. Because of the state of the house and the complaints an ultrasound inspection was carried out in 2006, revealing the extent of the tunnels.After 40 years' burrowing, Mole Man of Hackney is ordered to stop, The Guardian, 8 August 2006. When asked by journalists why he had excavated the tunnels, he said \\"I'm just a man who loves to dig\\" and that he just wanted \\"a big basement\\". He also said that \\"There is great beauty in inventing things that serve no purpose.\\" Lyttle was dubbed \\"The Mole Man of Hackney\\" by the press. Legal challenges Lyttle was evicted in 2006, and Hackney Borough Council filled the tunnels with aerated concrete. He contested the decision in court and returned to his home for a short time. In 2008, the High Court of Justice ordered that Lyttle cover the costs of the council making the structure safe, at a total of ¬£293,000.

S.) ‚Äì 16 August 1924) was a Russian poet and illustrator. A Symbolist poet, from the Silver Age of Russian Poetry, she won the Medal of Pushkin in 1908. She was the first person to translate Alice in Wonderland into the Russian language and was known for founding and illustrating the magazine and publishing house –¢—Ä–æ–ø–∏–Ω–∫–∞ (Path) with her partner, Natalia Manaseina. Early life Polyxena Sergeyevna Solovyova was born on 20 March 1867 O.S. in Moscow to Polyxena Vladimirovna (n√©e Romanova) and Sergey Solovyov. Her father was a noted historian and the rector of the University of Moscow. Her mother was from a Polish-Ukrainian family, who were related to the philosopher Gregory Skovoroda. Her paternal grandfather was Mikhail Vasilievich Solovyov, who had been a priest and law instructor. She was the youngest of 12 children, which included her brothers Vsevolod Solovyov and Vladimir. Her education began at home and she was able to read and write by age 5. After reading a poetry collection by Afanasy Fet, she began writing poetry. Later, she attended the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, studying under Vasily Polenov and Illarion Pryanishnikov. Career Solovyova began publishing poetry at the age of 16 with her first publication in the journal –ù–∏–≤–µ (The Field). She moved to Saint Petersburg in 1895, becoming involved with the literary circle which included Konstantin Balmont, Alexander Blok, Zinaida Gippius, Vyacheslav Ivanov, and Konstantin Sluchevsky, among other Symbolist poets. In 1898, at a gathering of Symbolist poets in the home of Mikhail Petrovich Manasein, a professor at the Imperial Military Medical Academy, Solovyova met him and his wife, Natalia. In 1899, when she published her first volume of poetry, which she also illustrated, called –°—Ç–∏—Ö–æ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è (Poems), she began using the pseudonym Allegro. She also published poetry in magazines like –í–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø—ã (European Herald), –ú–∏—Ä –ë–æ–∂–∏–π (God's World), and –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–æ (Russian Wealth). By around 1901, Solovyova met the sisters, Adelaida and Eugenia Gertsyk and also around 1903 became acquainted with the poet Maximilian Voloshin. From around 1906, she began summering in Koktebel, in the Crimea with the Gertsyk sisters, who headed a literary salon which included Voloshin and the Manaseins. In 1906, Solovyova founded the publishing house and children's magazine –¢—Ä–æ–ø–∏–Ω–∫–∞ (Path), where she worked as an editor, illustrator, and writer along with Manaseina. Both she and the publishing house were awarded the Pushkin Gold Medal in 1908. She personally published over twenty books while running –¢—Ä–æ–ø–∏–Ω–∫–∞, including many translations of noted literary works for children. She was the first to translate Alice in Wonderland into Russian, which she published as –ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ê–ª–∏—Å—ã –≤ –°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ —á—É–¥–µ—Å in 1909. The publication also became widely used by other Symbolist poets as an outlet for their creative works. It was a significant publishing house in the period, publishing around 100 books by 1918, for which more than half were for the Ministry of Education. In addition to writing and translating, Solovyova published many drawings for the magazine. Her works represent a wide range of styles, from imitations of children's sketches to Art Nouveau graphics. She also solicited drawings from other artists to enhance the layout of the magazine. Though she often followed in the Symbolist tradition, Solovyova also wrote in other genres, writing lullabies, religious legends, riddles and poems about nature and animals. One of these was a stage drama, Svadba solntsa i vesny (The Wedding of the Sun and the Spring) written in 1907 in celebration of spring. Music for the piece was written by Mikhail Kuzmin. Solovyova and Manaseina began an affair, and beginning 1909, they lived with Natalia's husband in the same house at #16 Voznesensky in Saint Petersburg. In 1917, the three lived in voluntary exile in Crimea to avoid the violence of the Russian Revolution in the capital. While living in the Crimea, she continued to write, but her works only occasionally managed to make it into the newspapers and journals in Simferopol or Feodosia. She taught for the Feodosia Department of Education and gave lectures in Koktebel at the People's University. To earn a living, she and Manaseina created and sold hats. At the end of 1923, with the help of friends Korney Chukovsky and Voloshin, Solovyova and Manaseina were able to return to Moscow. Solovyova was ill and almost immediately underwent an operation, but her health continued to decline. Death and legacy Solovyova died on 16 August 1924 in Moscow and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. For many years, her contributions to Russian literature were lost and there was no mention of her in the Soviet period. She was reintroduced as a figure of Russia's Silver Age in 1999, when Tatyana Nikitichna Zhukovskaya and Elena Albertovna Kallo compiled a book, Sub Rosa for Ellis Lak publishing in 1999. The book included works of Solovyova, as well as Cherubina de Gabriak, Adelaida Gertsyk, and Sophia Parnok. In the twenty-first century, revived scholarship on her work has taken place.

It was occupied in Neolithic, Roman and medieval times. Staden is close to the limestone hilltop of Staden Low whose summit is above sea level. Staden Low prehistoric earthwork is in a field on the western side of Staden Low hill. It is in the form of a slightly raised circular bank (over 50m across) with a smaller adjoining rectangular bank (which is a unique enclosure feature of British henges). Neolithic artefacts were discovered during excavations in 1926 by Mr R. Woolescroft, including a polished stone axe head and many fragments of knapped flint. Further excavations by Dr G. Makepeace in the 1980s uncovered Neolithic pottery sherds and pieces of deer antlers. The finds are on display in Buxton Museum. The site is a protected Scheduled Monument. Aerial LIDAR image of Staden Enclosure by the Environment Agency. Staden is one mile south of the Roman town of Aquae Arnemetiae (Roman Buxton) and there was a Roman farm at Staden (around the present Colt Croft Farm). The fields around Staden have rich volcanic soils for farming. Excavations by Dr Makepeace in the 1980s found the platforms of several buildings, walls, field enclosure banks, quern grinding stones, pottery, animal bones and jewellery. The potter's stamp of Sepuminus dates the pottery to 100‚Äì130 AD. A hypocaust tile found in the farm house demonstrates that it had an underfloor heating system. The stone platform of a 12th-century medieval longhouse (22m long) was also identified at the same site in 1989. Documents record Staden as a farming settlement in 1101 AD. There are the remains of an old quarry and lime kiln immediately south of the hilltop. In 1896 Buxton Cemetery on Ashbourne Road was consecrated on 12 acres of land on Staden Moor. The gothic-style cemetery building (with a central archway and a mortuary chapel on either side), the caretaker's house and the registrar's office were designed by the town surveyor Joseph Hague. The tombstone of the Buxton archaeologist Micah Salt from 1915 is a replica of the Anglo-Saxon cross in Eyam cemetery and it is a Grade II listed structure. The new Buxton fire station and rescue centre (opened in 2011) and Staden industrial estate are on the A515 road past the cemetery. Buxton Brewery was established in 2009 and is based on Staden Lane.

The late Mr. Coutts Trotter was the eldest son of Mr. Archibald Trotter, of Dreghorn, Midlothian, and by his death the Royal Geographical Society has lost a Fellow of thirty years' standing, and the Royal Scottish Geographical Society one of its earliest and most zealous supporters. He was born in April, 1831, in Edinburgh, and was educated at Rugby and Haileybury, being destined for the service of the East India Company. Here he gave evidence of future distinction, and carried off the gold medal for political economy. But, unfortunately, he was constitutionally delicate, and was soon to find that his bad health was sufficient to debar him from any public career of usefulness. Although appointed to a post in Bengal, he got no further than Bombay, and had to return home invalided almost immediately. When sufficiently recovered he made another attempt to join his post, but with equal unsuccess; the climate was too much for him. Then he studied for a short time at Balliol College, Oxford, without any intention of entering a profession. In 1862 he married a daughter of the Right Hon. R. Keatinge, one of the judges of the High Court of Justice in Dublin, and some years afterwards settled in Bournemouth for the benefit of his health. Here he began reviewing for the Athen√¶um, which he continued to do for nearly thirty years, and for the Academy till it changed hands. He also contributed to the Quarterly Review and Blackwood's Magazine. In 1882 he settled in Edinburgh, and two years afterwards he helped to found the Geographical Society of Scotland for the purpose of diffusing and popularizing that important branch of knowledge in the northern kingdom. His interest in it never slackened, and he continued to attend committee meetings almost up to the end, when he was so enfeebled that he could not walk without assistance. For the benefit of his health he was frequently ordered abroad. In 1886 he visited Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and Australia, thereby gaining a personal knowledge of that part of the world which made him a competent authority on geographical and other questions connected therewith. He had for some years previously taken a keen interest in such questions, and especially in the island of New Guinea, the extension of British influence over which found in him a warm advocate. At the invitation of his friend the Rev. Robertson Smith, then editor of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, he contributed to its ninth edition the articles on Fiji and New Guinea. He also read a paper on New Guinea at the meeting of the British Association in 1883, and a more extended account of the existing knowledge of the great island was printed in the R.G.S. Proceedings in 1884. He had carefully studied the history of discovery in this region, and served for several years on the council of the Hakluyt Society.  Family  His daughter Louisa Kathleen Coutts Trotter (1863‚Äì1961) married John Scott Haldane and was mother of J. B. S. Haldane and Naomi Mitchison.

As a political science student at the Complutense University of Madrid she took classes with Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n, who was a lecturer there. When Iglesias founded Podemos in 2014 and won election as a Member of the European Parliament, he chose Bousselham as the head of his cabinet of advisors. Bousselham was later named as a manager of the Podemos party apparatus in Madrid, and she was chosen in a primary election as a Podemos candidate for the regional citizens council in 2019. However, after her application for Spanish citizenship was denied, she was not able to contest the general election. In 2020, she left Podemos to head the digital news service La √öltima Hora! Early life and education Bousselham was born in 1990 in Tangier, and studied at the Instituto Espa√±ol Severo Ochoa. In 2008, at the age of 18, she moved to Madrid to study and to play football. She attended the Complutense University of Madrid where she studied political science. At the same time, she played football competitively in the CF Pozuelo and the club Santa Maria Caridad. She stopped playing competitive football in 2010 to focus on her studies. One of her professors of politics at the Complutense University was Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n. Bousselham also took part in the Erasmus Programme at the University of Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3. After graduating in political science from the Complutense University, Bousselham completed a Master's degree at the Paris Institute for Advanced Studies in Latin America (fr). She then returned to Madrid and completed a diploma in international relations, focusing on the prevention of international conflicts and cooperation and security in the Mediterranean region. Career When Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n founded the Spanish political party Podemos in 2014, he selected Bousselham as a prominent assistant to work with him in the European Parliament. She became the head of his cabinet of advisors in the European Parliament. While she was a prominent assistant of Pablo Iglesias, a mobile phone that contained sensitive party information was stolen from her. Later, the Police Commissioner Jos√© Manuel Villarejo (es) was potentially implicated in possessing copies of the information that had been on the phone's memory card, which led to a court case investigating the possibility that the theft was politically motivated. During the investigation it was discovered that the journalist Antonio Asensio had given Iglesias the card of the stolen mobile phone and that he had had it in his possession for a year and a half without telling Bousselham.El ‚Äúcaso Dina‚Äù contado para quien no tiene idea de qu√© va pero quiere enterarse in confilegal.com (in Spanish) In 2016, Bousselham was a member of Ram√≥n Espinar Merino's candidacy list in the internal primary of Podemos Madrid, and she was elected to be a member of the Regional Citizens Council. In 2018 she applied to become a Spanish citizen, which is a necessary prerequisite for running as a candidate in regional elections. After Espinar resigned as the secretary general of Madrid Podemos, Bousselham was a member of the management appointed by the state party leadership to manage the party organization. However, Bousselham was not granted Spanish citizenship after her application in 2018, and she was not able to appear on the party list in the November 2019 Spanish general election. In May 2020, Bousselham departed from Podemos to head the left- leaning online news source La √öltima Hora!

In the years preceding 2020 UK farmers had increasingly relied on as many as 50,000 to 60,000 migrant workers to harvest crops, but because of a labour shortage precipitated by measures introduced to control the pandemic the sourcing of workers from overseas became extremely difficult. The campaign was launched to recruit fruit and vegetable pickers from the UK and aimed at workers furloughed from their regular jobs. A website, pickforbritain.org, was also launched, together with an advertising campaign supported by the broadcaster ITV and supermarket retailer Waitrose. Although some people initially came forward to offer their help, it was estimated that a \\"food army\\" of 40,000 people would be needed in order to prevent unharvested crops from being spoiled.

The ecoregion covers the peninsular lowlands of western New Guinea, along with the Aru Islands and other nearby islands. Geography The ecoregion includes the lowland and hill (below 1000 meters elevation) forests of the Bird's Head Peninsula (also known as the Vogelkop Peninsula), Bomberai Peninsula, and the Bird's Neck Isthmus, as well as the Aru Islands to the south and Raja Ampat Islands (Misool, Salawati, Waigeo, Kofiau, and others) to the west. The Aru and Raja Ampat islands sit on the Australia-New Guinea continental shelf. When sea levels were lower during the ice ages, these islands were joined to the Australia-New Guinea continent, which allowed terrestrial plants and animals to move between them. The peninsular mountains above 1000 meters elevation, including the Arfak Mountains and Tamrau Mountains, constitute the separate and distinct Vogelkop montane rain forests ecoregion.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J.

In the 18th and 19th century, there were few formal training opportunities for women to train as engineers and frequently women were introduced to engineering through family companies or their spouses. Some women did have more formal educations in the late 19th century and early 20th century, normally in mathematics or science subjects.There are several examples of women filing patents in the 19th century, including Sarah Guppy, Henrietta Vansittart and Hertha Ayrton. During the first two decades of the 20th century new opportunities arose for women to go to university and earn degrees and there were increasing numbers of women studying maths and physics at universities across the UK. The job opportunities for women opened up by World War I meant many women were trained in various forms of engineering. In 1919, the Women‚Äôs Engineering Society (WES) was founded to protect these jobs for women, which, once the war ended, were handed back to the men returning from the front, as decreed by the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act (1919). The 1920s and 30s produced many successful women engineers, who were able to forge careers for themselves in various fields, including aeronautical, automotive and electrical engineering. Many of these women were members of WES.  19th century  Helena Ars√®ne Darmesteter - Portrait of Hertha Ayrton Inventors and engineers in the early 19th century in the UK include Sarah Guppy, the first woman in the UK to patent a bridge. Later in the 19th century, there are more examples of women patenting inventions and practising as engineers. Naval engineer Henrietta Vansittart, who was introduced to engineering by her father James Lowe, contributed to naval engineering and held patents across the world for the Lowe-Vansittart propeller. Similarly, another naval engineer, Blanche Thornycroft, found her way into engineering through a family connection. She worked as part of her father's engineering business on the Isle of Wight. Electrical engineer and physicist, Hertha Ayrton, was the first woman admitted to the IEE (the Institution of Electrical Engineers, now the IET), the premier British electrical engineering profession institution, in recognition of her work on electrical arc lighting. Many women in this era were collaborators in engineering projects with their husbands. The effort to electrify the home in the late 19th century involved many women, including Alice Mary Gordon, who wrote a book called Decorative Electricity, which included a section detailing life as an engineering spouse. Katharine Parsons worked with her husband Sir Charles Parsons on the steam turbine engine and later founded the Women‚Äôs Engineering Society. Margaret, Lady Moir described herself as an \\"engineer by marriage\\" through her relationship with Ernest Moir. Several of the women who went on to be founding members of WES were also involved in the women's suffrage movement, including Katharine Parsons and her daughter, Rachel Parsons, Lady Moir, Laura Annie Willson (who was arrested twice for suffragette activities) and Caroline Haslett.https://electrifyingwomen.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/56/2020/04/EW-5-key-themes-Activism-PDF.pdf  Early 20th century  The 1911 census recorded no woman listing her profession as an engineer. However, at the start of the 20th century in the UK, there were greater opportunities for women to study at university and there were more instances of women studying for degrees in physics, mathematics, and engineering subjects. Electrical Engineer and businesswoman Margaret Partridge studied maths at Bedford College, graduating in 1914. Aeronautical engineer Hilda Lyon went to study maths at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1915. Many women attended Loughborough College (now University), which admitted the first cohort of women engineers in 1919, including mechanical engineer Verena Holmes and engineer, writer and traveller Claudia Parsons. Georgina Kermode's career as socialite, suffragette, metallurgist and serial patentee (in particular the first successful postage stamp selling machines), seems to have emerged from her early marriage to an engineer, whom she soon left behind. Many women gained engineering experience during World War One. As men were away fighting, jobs in factories had to be filled by women. Women in engineering such as Doroth√©e Pullinger, Rachel Parsons, Margaret Dorothea Rowbotham and Laura Annie Willson all learned important aspects of their trades through working during World War One, particularly in the production of munitions. Recognition of the roles naval architects Blanche Thornycroft, Eily Keary, and Rachel Parsons played was recognised on 9 April 1919 when they became the first three women to be admitted as associate members by the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, Keary having been the first woman to contributed a paper in the institution‚Äôs transactions in 1916. Once the war was over, these jobs were threatened by the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act (1919), which stated that the jobs women filled had to be handed back to the men returning from the front. Another act of parliament later in 1919 attempted to improve women's professional and educational rights. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 received Royal Assent on 23 December 1919. The act enabled women to join the professions and professional bodies (including those representing the engineering professions), to sit on juries and be awarded degrees: \\"A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, or from being appointed to or holding any civil or judicial office or post, or from entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation, or for admission to any incorporated society (whether incorporated by Royal Charter or otherwise)...\\" It was an enabling act, not an enforcing one, but did open the doors of the professional engineering institutions to women who could earn the qualifications and had the professional experience required to pass the entry examinations.  The founding of the Women's Engineering Society  The Women's Engineering Society - the first of its kind in the world - was founded on 23 June 1919 to protect the jobs that women had gained during World War One and to continue promoting the place of women in engineering. Seven woman signed the foundation documents: Eleanor Shelley- Rolls, Margaret, Lady Moir, Laura Annie Willson, Margaret Rowbotham, Katharine Parsons, Rachel Parsons and Janetta Mary Ornsby. The first Secretary appointed was Caroline Haslett, who had trained as a boiler-maker during World War One, and was later made a Dame for her services to industry and business. The United States equivalent, the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), was founded in 1950.  Inter war period  Through these new opportunities, the 1920s and 1930s in the UK were an active time for women in engineering and WES. In 1923 Elsie Louisa Winterton, a draughtswoman working for the Great Western Railway (GWR) became the first woman member of the Institution of Railway Signal Engineers. In July 1925 the First International Conference of Women in Science, Industry & Commerce was held in London, during the British Empire Exhibition. It was organised by Caroline Haslett & WES, and opened by the Duchess of York in her first public engagement since her marriage into the royal family. Chaired by Lady Astor, the first woman MP to take her seat in the House of Commons, its speakers and attendee list represented key figures in the suffrage and women's rights movements in Britain and abroad, including Millicent Fawcett, Viscountess Rhondda, Kerstin Hesselgren the first woman elected to Upper House of the Swedish parliament and American engineer Ethel H. Bailey. In 1924, members of WES, including Caroline Haslett, Margaret Moir and Margaret Partridge founded the Electrical Association for Women. This association aimed to educate women about electricity, providing courses in Electrical Housecraft and demonstrations at electrical showrooms. It published The Electrical Handbook for Women, a guide to electricity, which was re-issued (though with different names) until 1983. Careers developed in companies such as Metropolitan Vickers in Manchester, where engineer Gertrude Entwisle worked for her entire career. In 1927, Dorothy Donaldson Buchanan successfully passed the admission examination to become the first female member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1929 Winifred Hackett was the first woman to graduate in electrical engineering from the University of Birmingham. By the 1950s Hackett was head of the Guided Weapons Division at aerospace and defence company English Electric. In 1934, pilot and engineer Amy Johnson became the youngest president of WES, serving under her married name of 'Mrs Jim Mollison', four years after becoming the first woman to fly solo from the UK to Australia. That same year, Jeanie Dicks, the first female member of the Electrical Contractors Association, was responsible for the first permanent electrification of Winchester Cathedral. A register of members from 1935 shows the international membership of WES and the variety of different women who were members. Before World War Two, German Jewish engineer Ira Rischowski took refuge in the United Kingdom, becoming a member of WES, having already been in correspondence with them at the start of the War. Because of her German heritage, she was interned as an enemy alien at the Rushen camp on the Isle of Wight but returned to an engineering career once freed in 1942. In 1938, Marja Ludwika Ziff (later known as Maria Watkins) became the first woman to study electrical engineering at the University of Edinburgh, the professor who had offered her a place believing her application was from a Polish man. She later became a defence engineer and university lecturer.  World War Two  Women continued to play an active role in engineering in World War Two and WES were vocal about promoting women's place in industry. Women proved once again their ability to take on roles seen as exclusively for men, while women with formal training in engineering from before the War were able to demonstrate their innovative capacity. Aeronautical engineer Beatrice Shilling, for example, engineered the RAE restrictor for use in Hurricane and Spitfire planes, which had previously been failing during air battle. Isabel Hardwich, electrical engineer and photometry expert joined the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Ltd. in Manchester in 1941, and later became supervisor of technical women within their Research Department, as well as a president of WES.  Post-war, Cold War and second wave feminism  Although women who had gained engineering opportunities in both industry and the forces during World War Two were forced out of those positions in an almost identical situation to that following World War One, there were enough women sufficiently established in senior roles in government research establishments, such as the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Building Research Establishment and similar, that there continued to be more openings for women. Beatrice Shilling, for instance, remained at the RAE to work on rocket engines and was consulted by NASA on runway surfaces for the future space shuttles. In the same era, Anne Burns introduced the use of strain gauges for inflight testing, contributing to solving the reasons for the Comet airliner crashes of the 1950s. In 1947 Mary Thompson Irvine became the first woman to be elected a chartered member of the Institution of Structural Engineers. In the early 1950s Mary Coombs became the first woman to work on a commercial computer, the LEO computer. In 1967, WES led the organisation of the second International Conference for Women Engineers & Scientists, held in Cambridge. The conference was attended by delegates from across the globe, with many international speakers, including from African and Asian countries. Tidal engineer Mary Kendrick began leading the team working on the Thames Barrier in 1968. She later became the first female Acting Conservator of the River Mersey responsible for keeping the River Mersey navigable, a role dating back to 1625. In 1969, Shirley Williams MP, then Minister for Education and Science, launched the first Women in Engineering Year campaign in conjunction with WES to encourage girls and young women to take up engineering as a career. Although numbers were tiny until the 1970s, increasing numbers of women started to take university degrees and trade qualifications in engineering subjects. It was still a period when a talented person could rise from the technician ranks without a degree, as defence engineer Joan Lavender was able to do at DeHavillands and engineering software designer Judy Butland was able to do at Manchester University and then with her own software business. The defence industry, aviation and the emerging computer hardware and software industries were areas when many women found careers at that time. Examples include Elizabeth Killick, WES presidents Elizabeth Laverick and Peggy Hodges and the founder of the UK's first independent commercial software company, Dina St Johnston. In 1979 the Finniston Report into the engineering profession in the United Kingdom was commissioned by the Labour government. This ultimately led to the foundation of the Engineering Council in 1981, which in its turn collaborated with the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) to launch the Women into Science and Engineering (WISE) year in 1984. Spearheaded by Baroness Beryl Platt, Chair of the EOC and herself an aeronautical engineer, WISE aimed to highlight the career opportunities for girls and women in science and engineering professions. At the time of the launch of WISE, only 7% of engineering graduates in the UK were women.

Together with Franz Hessel he translated and edited the memoirs \\"Histoire de ma vie\\" by Giacomo Casanova (1725‚Äì1798). His most important work is a comprehensive dream anthology, published in 1928, Das Buch der Tr√§ume (The Book of Dreams). This monumental work of over 700 pages is a comprehensive dream anthology with interpretations in two parts: first the dreams themselves, then \\"statements about the dreams\\", biographies and interpretations. This book helped popularize the modern interpretation of dreams . The Book of Dreams also made an important contribution to cultural history by also presenting the dream as a cultural and aesthetic phenomenon. It also contains a detailed review of dream literature from the 19th and early 20th centuries, including Sigmund Freud's work. The book was dedicated to Alfred D√∂blin. From 1931 to 1939, they lived with their daughter Veronika in the Wilmersdorf artist colony. Fellow intellectuals Alfred Kantorowicz, Ernst Busch, Erich Weinert, Peter Huchel, Ernst Bloch and many other celebrities also lived there in the so-called Roten Insel (Red Island) that was hated by the Nazis. Nazi Era & Fate On 13 January 1942 Ignaz and Erna Jezower were driven out of a collection point at the synagogue on Levetzowstrasse 7-8 in the Tiergarten district, with several hundred Berliners through the city to the Grunewald train station where they, and 1,034 others, were placed in 3rd class passenger cars. They were 71 and 61 years old.

Front cover of box, art by Kenneth Rahman (Eymoth), 1980 Setting Knights of Camelot is a board game set during the reign of King Arthur. The players take on the roles of chivalrous new knights who go forth to fight evil and right wrongs. The Knight earns Chivalry Points and Virtue Points in the hopes of one day becoming a Knight of the Round Table. The mechanism to discern a Knight's true worth is Virtue Level, which is calculated by dividing Chivalry Points by Virtue Points. The lower the Virtue Level, the more virtuous the knight. As game designer Charles Vasey pointed out, \\"a Knight who grows mighty without caring for his immortal soul, or remembering the Poor and the Church of God, will find his Virtue Level getting bigger (whereas in this game ... a low Virtue Level is what you want). Components The game comes with: * a map * a 36-page rule book * die-cut counters for knights, other personalities, items and monsters * 75 Knight cards, 15 King cards and 30 Lady cards * three dice * A sheet of reference tables Publication History Knight of Camelot was designed by Glenn and Kenneth Rahman. The box art was by Kenneth Rahman (under the pseudonym Eymoth) and Erol Otus, and interior art was by Jeff Dee, David S. LaForce, David C. Sutherland III, and Kenneth Rahman. The map was designed by Darlene Pekul. In the February 1982 edition of Dragon (Issue #58), game designer Glenn Rahmann published alternate rules for players who wanted to play evil knights, called knaves. Reception In the August-September 1980 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #26), Charles Vasey found the game had \\"a pleasing design [and] a helpful set of counters.\\" However, he found that because the game's random encounters came from finite tables, \\"you will find that the game gets samey after quite a few plays\\", although Vasey did admit this would take some time, since \\"the designers have provided lots of these tables.\\" Vasey admired the Virtue Level mechanism for judging a knight's purity. But he found the map \\"a little unexciting and rather small, and hence rather featureless\\"; he suggested swapping the map with that of another game such as Chaosium's King Arthur's Knights. He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 7 out of 10, stating that this was \\"a well-designed game that succeeds at all it essays.\\" In King Arthur in America, Alan Lupack and Barbara Tep Lupack identified Knights of Camelot as part of a growing trend in the 1970s to move games involving Arthurian legend from simplistic fare for children to increasingly sophisticated adult games. In Marketing Arthur: The Commodification of Arthurian Legend, Elizabeth Sklar differentiated between exploitative and glib promotional Arthuriana, which uses the Arthur legends to sell things, and games like Knights of Camelot, an Arthurian product that \\"treats the legend seriously, even reverentially.\\" She pointed out that the counters \\"include all major and many of the minor figures, both male and female, from the Morte d'Arthur, and for those that prove themselves sufficiently worthy, the game culminates in the Grail Quest.\\" Awards At the 1980 Charles S. Roberts Awards, Knights of Camelot was a finalist in two categories: Best Pre-Twentieth Century Game, and Best Fantasy or Science- Fiction Board Game.

At age six or seven, he moved with his mother and brother from Utah to Oregon, after his parents split. Kelley played three years of varsity basketball for Gervais High School in Gervais, Oregon. While attending Gervais, he grew from 6'1 to 7'0 but did not weigh more than 185 pounds. As a senior, Kelley averaged 15.9 points, 12.4 rebounds, 7.8 blocks and 2.4 assists per game and was named PacWest Player of the Year. He set the school's career, single-season and single-game records for blocks. Kelley struggled academically and did not qualify to play for most four-year colleges. As a result, he had no NCAA Division I offers out of high school. College career Kelley began playing college basketball for Northwest Christian University. He was forced to redshirt his first season after dentists discovered that he had severe dental issues, as he had not grown up taking care of his teeth, and would require frequent dental work. As a redshirt freshman, Kelley averaged 8.6 points, 8.8 rebounds and 5.6 blocks per game and set a school single-game record with 10 blocks against Southern Oregon. After 10 games, he was dismissed from Northwest Christian due to his poor academic performance.

In his sophomore season, he averaged 9.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.6 blocks per game and was a Northwest Athletic Conference All-Defensive Team selection. At Lane CC, Kelley was recruited by multiple Pac-12 programs and chose to continue his career at Oregon State because he wanted to stay close to home. On December 17, 2018, as a junior at Oregon State, Kelley tallied a school- record nine blocks, to go with 10 points and nine rebounds, in an 82‚Äì67 victory over Pepperdine. By the end of the season, he ranked second in the nation, led the Pac-12 and set a school record with 3.35 blocks per game. He also averaged 7.7 points and five rebounds per game and was named to the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team. On December 18, 2019, as a senior, Kelley posted a season-high 23 points, six rebounds and three blocks in an 88‚Äì78 win over UTSA. He became Oregon State's all-time leader in blocks in a January 30, 2020 victory over Stanford, during which he posted 10 points, seven blocks and six rebounds.

Born in Wriezen, M√ºntner completed an apprenticeship as a saddler and travelled extensively in his journeyman years, before settling in Berlin in 1894. He joined the Union of Saddlers of Germany and also the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). From 1902, he began working full-time for the union, running its health insurance scheme in Berlin. In 1905/06, he served as the SPD secretary in Rixdorf. M√ºntner became known for his strong administrative skills, and in 1906 was elected as national treasurer of his union. He actively supported its merger into the Union of Saddlers and Portfolio Makers in 1909, and then became the editor of the new union's journal, Sattler- und Portefeuiller-Zeitung. However, he felt that the union was being badly run and resigned in 1911. He found work as the Leipzig district leader of the Union of Municipal and State Workers, where he soon overcame resistance to the appointment of someone from outside the union. In 1912, he was instead appointed as chair of the union's Greater Berlin district, although he did not take up the post until 1914. In the role, he focused on supporting the relatives of members who had been called up to fight in World War I, and also served on the city's Nutrition Committee. He also negotiated a maximum eight-hour working day for most city workers. After the November Revolution, union membership in Berlin grew rapidly, but M√ºntner faced criticism from the left wing of the union for having supported the war effort. Despite this, in 1919, he was elected as national vice president of the union. In 1920, the union's president resigned, and M√ºntner was appointed to replace him. That year, he was also elected to Berlin City Council. As leader of the union, M√ºntner served on the Provisional National Economic Council, and the executive of the General German Trade Union Confederation (ADGB). He advocated compulsory arbitration in disputes and a national eight- hour working day, and argued against resistance to the Occupation of the Ruhr. In 1929, M√ºntner was elected as general secretary of the International Federation of Employees in Public Services. He immediately organised an international congress of energy workers, to campaign against privatisation, but thereafter struggled to achieve much in the role, as the federation's finances worsened. This financial struggle also affected the Union of Municipal and State Workers, and M√ºntner arranged for it to merge with several other unions to form the General Union of Public Sector and Transport Workers (GV); he became its joint president. Just before the union merger, M√ºntner became seriously ill with heart problems. He recovered sufficiently to become the auditor of the ADGB in 1931, but retired from all his trade union posts in October 1932. GV was banned in 1933, and M√ºntner had to leave his union-owned apartment. He died the following year.

The first stage of the reform occurred in 1802‚Äì1803, the second stage was carried out in 1810‚Äì1811. As a result of the reform, the ministries replaced the archaic collegiums. Background The onset of the nineteenth century brought public administration reforms to Russia: upon accession to the throne, the young emperor Alexander I created the State Council (\\"The Permanent Council\\"), active work was underway on new laws, but a new management system was needed that could quickly solve many growing problems of public policy. On September 8, 1802, Alexander I signed the manifesto \\"On the Establishment of Ministries\\". Even then, the emperor reformer emphasized that \\"we expect them to be loyal, active and zealous for the good of all...\\".Anatoly Predtechensky. Essays on the Socio‚ÄìPolitical History of Russia in the First Quarter of the 19th Century ‚Äì Moscow‚ÄìLeningrad, 1957 Origins of ministerial reformFirst transformative experiments= The first transformative experiments were associated with the initial period of the reign of Emperor Alexander I, whose accession to the throne was enthusiastically received by Russian society. The new government hastened to immediately declare the direction in which it intended to act. In the manifesto on March 12, 1801, the emperor assumed the obligation to rule the people \\"according to the laws and to the heart of his wise grandmother\\". In the decrees, as well as in private conversations, the emperor expressed the basic rule by which he would be guided: actively place strict law in place of personal arbitrariness. The emperor has repeatedly pointed out the main flaw with which the Russian state order suffered. He called this flaw \\"the arbitrariness of our rule\\". To eliminate it, it was necessary to develop fundamental laws, which almost did not exist in Russia. It was in this direction that the transformative experiments of the first years were conducted. From the first days of the new reign, the emperor was surrounded by people whom the emperor urged to help him with transformative work. These were former members of the grand-ducal circle: Count Pavel Stroganov, Count Victor Kochubey, Prince Adam Chartorysky and Nikolay Novosiltsev. These people formed the so-called \\"Secret Committee\\", which gathered in the secluded room of the emperor during 1801‚Äì1803 and worked out a plan of necessary transformations with it. The task of this committee was to help the emperor \\"in a systematic work on the reform of the shapeless empire management building\\". It was supposed to preliminarily study the current situation of the empire, then to transform certain parts of the administration and complete these separate reforms with \\"the code established on the basis of the true national spirit\\". The \\"Secret Committee\\", which functioned until November 9, 1803, for two and a half years considered the implementation of the Senate and Ministerial reforms, the activities of the \\"Permanent Council\\", the peasant question, the coronation projects of 1801 and a number of foreign policy events. Started with central management. The Council at the Supreme Court, assembled at the personal discretion of Empress Catherine, was replaced by a permanent institution, called the \\"Permanent Council\\", on April 11, 1801, for the consideration and discussion of state affairs and decisions. It consisted of 12 high dignitaries without division into departments. After a year and a half, the Peter's collegiums were transformed, which already under Catherine, having lost their original character. Then a personal decree was issued on the rights and obligations of the Senate. Along with administrative reforms, public relations were also affected. It also sharply stated the direction in which it was supposed to act. This direction consisted in the equation of all social conditions before the law. Thus, the new central departments and ministries were the sole institutions, and the provincial institutions led by them maintained the former collegial system. =Preparation and development of ministerial reform= The discussion of the ministerial reform was devoted to 9 meetings of the Secret Committee (8 meetings from February 10 to May 12, 1802 and one meeting on March 16, 1803). The ministerial reform had both supporters (Victor Kochubei, Nikolai Novosiltsev, Adam Chartorysky, Pavel Stroganov, etc.) and opponents (Dmitry Troshchinsky, Sergey Rumyantsev, Peter Zavadovsky and others). The foundation for the establishment of a ministerial system of government in Russia was laid on September 8, 1802, with the manifesto \\"On the Establishment of Ministries\\". With this document, the collegiums were transformed into eight ministries ‚Äì foreign affairs, military ground forces, naval forces, internal affairs, finance, justice, commerce and public education. In addition to the eight new ministries, the Manifesto determined the position of two other public administration institutions that existed before ‚Äì the \\"departments\\" of the State Treasurer and the Expedition on State Revenues. They continued to act \\"until the publication of the complete Charter for this part\\", based on the Decree of October 24, 1780. According to this decree, the Expedition on State Revenues was subordinate to the person performing the position of State Treasurer. Thus, the status of the State Treasury was confirmed as another, along with eight ministries, the central government administration institution. According to the Manifesto of September 8, 1802, the former collegiums and their subordinate places were reassigned to ministries or entered into them as departments; the main difference between the new central government bodies was the one-man management: each department was governed by a minister instead of the former collegial presence; ministers were responsible to the Senate. Each subordinate body presented its minister with weekly memorials of current affairs and representations in special cases. The minister answered them with suggestions. In case of disagreement with the Minister's proposals, the subordinate bodies presented reasoning to the Minister. If the latter insisted on his proposal, then it was executed, and the opinion of subordinate bodies was recorded in the journal. Thus, the combination of two public administration systems ‚Äì collegial and ministerial ‚Äì was carried out, which was the result of a compromise decision made by Alexander I at a meeting of the \\"Secret Committee\\" on March 24, 1802. In accordance with this decision, the collegiums were not abolished, but continued to act in subordination to the ministers and were subject to gradual abolition in the future, when experience shows their futility. To assist the ministers (except for the ministers of the military ground forces, naval forces, commerce and the State Treasurer), deputy deputies were appointed ‚Äì comrades of ministers who could replace the latter during their absence. Ministers pledged to immediately engage in the formation of their offices and the compilation of their staffs. The Manifesto's last sentence briefly mentions a committee \\"composed solely\\" of ministers considering current affairs. Thus, an important government body was created ‚Äì the Committee of Ministers, which had a significant impact not only on the ministerial system, but also on the entire system of state power of the Russian Empire. =Speransky's conversion plan= In the first years of the reign of Alexander I, Mikhail Speransky still remained in the background, although he prepared some documents and projects for members of the \\"Secret Committee\\", including on ministerial reform. A week after the accession of Alexander I to the throne, Speransky was appointed Secretary of State under Dmitry Troshchinsky, who, in turn, served as Secretary of State under Alexander I. Thus Speransky found himself in a circle of people who largely determined the state's policy. The abilities of the assistant Troshchinsky attracted the attention of members of the \\"Secret Committee\\". In the summer of 1801, Viktor Kochubey took Speransky to his \\"team\\". At that time, work was under way in the Secret Committee on the development of ministerial reform. After the reform, Kochubey, who headed the Ministry of the Interior, transferred him to his office. In June 1802, Speransky headed the department at the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which was instructed to prepare draft state reforms. In 1802‚Äì1804, Speransky prepared several of his own political notes: \\"On the Fundamental Laws of the State\\", \\"On the Gradual Improvement of Public Opinion\\", \\"On the Power of Public Opinion\\", \\"Something More About Freedom and Slavery\\". In these documents, he first stated his views on the state of the Russian state apparatus and substantiated the need for reforms in the country. On February 20, 1803, with the direct participation of Speransky, the famous decree \\"On Free Cultivators\\" was published. According to this decree, the landowners received the right to release the serfs into \\"freedom\\", giving them land. Inspired by the \\"Notes\\" of the young leader, the king through Viktor Kochubey instructs Speransky to write a capital treatise ‚Äì a plan for transforming the state machine of the empire, and he enthusiastically gives himself to a new job. In 1803, on behalf of the emperor, Speransky compiled a \\"Note on the Structure of Judicial and Governmental Institutions in Russia\\", in which he proved himself to be a supporter of the constitutional monarchy, created by the gradual reform of society on the basis of a carefully developed plan. However, this Note did not have practical value. Only in 1807, after unsuccessful wars with France and the signing of the Tilsit Peace, in the context of the domestic political crisis, did Alexander again turn to reform plans. Speransky was essentially a zealous and diligent official, independent by virtue of his descent from a particular group of high-ranking aristocracy. He was to develop and implement a reform plan based on the ideas and principles prompted by the emperor. Speransky did not immediately receive his new role. At first, the emperor entrusted him with some \\"private affairs\\". Already in 1807, Speransky was invited several times to dinner at the courtyard, this fall he accompanied Alexander to Vitebsk for a military review, and a year later to Erfurt, to meet with Napoleon. It was already a sign of high confidence. In Erfurt, Speransky, who was fluent in French, became close to representatives of the French administration, looked closely at them, and learned a lot from them. Upon returning to Russia, Speransky was appointed a fellow of the Minister of Justice and, together with the emperor, began working on a general plan of state reforms. The most complete reformist views of Mikhail Speransky were reflected in a note in 1809 ‚Äì \\"Introduction to the Enactment of State Laws\\". The reformer attached great importance to the regulatory role of the state in the development of domestic industry and, through its political transformations, strengthened the autocracy in every way. Speransky writes: \\"If the rights of state power were unlimited, if the state forces were united in sovereign power and they did not leave any rights to subjects, then the state would be in slavery and the government would be despotic\\". The reform plan drawn up by Speransky was, as it were, an exposition of the thoughts, ideas and intentions of the sovereign himself. As the contemporary researcher of this problem Sergey Mironenko correctly observes, \\"independently, without the tsar's sanction and approval, Speransky would never have dared to propose measures that were extremely radical in the conditions of the then Russia\\". Final stage of ministerial reformCentral control administration according to the plan of Speransky= On March 28, 1806, Minister of the Interior Viktor Kochubey submitted to Alexander I a \\"Note on the Establishment of Ministries\\". It noted a \\"perfect confusion\\" in public administration, which \\"reached the highest degree\\" after the ministerial reform of 1802. The Minister proposed the following corrective measures: *The selection of like-minded ministers; *Determining the attitude of ministries to the Senate, the Committee of Ministers, the Permanent Council, the provincial government; *Settlement of relations between ministries; *Empowerment of ministers on the merits; *Definition of responsibility of ministers. The foreign political events of 1805‚Äì1808 (the war with France as part of the Third Coalition in 1805 and the Fourth Coalition in 1806‚Äì1807, the Russian‚ÄìFrench negotiations in Tilsit in June 1807 and in Erfurt in October 1808) diverted Alexander I's attention from affairs of internal management. But it was precisely at this time that Mikhail Speransky, the true author of the report of July 18, 1803 and the note of March 28, 1806, began to take an increasingly active part in the implementation of the ministerial reform. =Legislative reform= Since the end of 1808, Mikhail Speransky became the closest associate of Alexander I, with the sanction of the latter dealing with \\"subjects of higher management\\". By October 1809, the shortcomings of ministerial reform were systematized by Mikhail Speransky in his \\"Introduction to the Enforcement of State Laws\\" ‚Äì an extensive plan of reforms for the entire domestic political structure of the country, drawn up on behalf of Alexander I. In this project, Speransky identifies three main disadvantages of ministerial reform: *Lack of responsibility of ministers; *Some inaccuracy and disproportion in the division of affairs between the ministries; *Lack of precise rules or institution.Vasily Klyuchevsky. Selected Lectures of the Course of Russian History ‚Äì Rostov-on-Don, 2002 A new transformation of the ministries of 1810‚Äì1811 was aimed at eliminating these shortcomings. Ministerial reform has entered its final period. Its beginning was already proclaimed in the Manifesto \\"On the Establishment of the State Council\\": \\"The various units entrusted to the Ministries require different additions. At the initial establishment, it was supposed, gradually and considering their very action, to bring these establishments to perfection. Experience has shown the need to complete their most convenient division. We will propose to the Council the beginnings of their final arrangement and the main foundations of the General Ministerial Order, which accurately defines the relations of the Ministers to other State Establishments and their limits of action and the degree of their responsibility will be indicated\\". The legal basis for the final period of the ministerial reform was three legislative acts: *The manifesto \\"On the Division of State Affairs Into Special Departments, With the Designation of Objects Belonging to Each Department\\" of July 25, 1810, *\\"The Highest Approved Division of State Affairs into Ministries\\" of August 17, 1810, and *\\"General Institution of the Ministries\\" of June 25, 1811.Manifesto on the \\"General Institution of Ministries\\" These acts were previously discussed in a specially created committee for consideration of proposals for the transformation of ministries and the Senate and on the new recruitment procedure for the Committee of Chairmen of Departments of the State Council, which operated from May 27, 1810 to November 28, 1811. Further, the projects were approved at a general meeting of the State Council and submitted to the emperor for approval. The drafts of all three acts were developed by Mikhail Speransky.Mikhail Prikhodko. Preparation and Development of Ministerial Reform in Russia (February ‚Äì September 1802) ‚Äì Moscow, 2002 The manifesto of July 25, 1810 divided all state affairs \\"in executive order\\" into five main parts: *Foreign relations administered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; *External security device, which was entrusted to the military and naval ministries; *State economy, which was in charge of the ministries of internal affairs, education, finance, the State treasurer, the audit of state accounts, the Main Directorate of Ways of communication; *The structure of the civil and criminal court, which was entrusted to the Ministry of Justice; *Internal security device, which fell under the competence of the Ministry of Police. The manifesto proclaimed the creation of new central government bodies ‚Äì the Ministry of Police and the General Directorate of Spiritual Affairs of various confessions. The competence of the Ministry of the Interior changed significantly: its main subject was \\"care for the dissemination and promotion of agriculture and industry\\". All cases related to the \\"precautionary\\" and \\"executive\\" police were transferred to the Ministry of Police. The title of State Comptroller was established ‚Äì the head of the audit of state accounts. Details and controversial issues arising from the direct distribution of cases were discussed in the Committee of Ministers at a meeting on August 4, 1810. The reports of the ministers of foreign affairs, finance, public education, justice, as well as the comrade of the Minister of the Interior were heard. The result of this discussion was the \\"Highest Approved Separation of State Affairs into Ministries\\" of August 17, 1810. This act specified the composition of the ministries of the interior, police, public education, finance, the General Directorate of Spiritual Affairs of Foreign Confessions, and also recorded the liquidation of the Ministry of Commerce. The Manifesto of January 28, 1811 became a continuation of concretization in the field of public administration. \\"On the Structure of the General Directorate for the Audit of State Accounts\\". The \\"General Establishment of Ministries\\" of June 25, 1811 became the main legislative act of the ministerial reform. Structurally, it consisted of two parts: *\\"Formation of Ministries\\"; *\\"General Mandate to Ministries\\". The manifesto determined the general division of state affairs and subjects of each ministry and the main administration, largely repeating textually the provisions of the manifesto on July 25, 1810. It established a single overall organizational structure of the central governing bodies. The ministry was headed by the minister and his comrade (deputy). Under the minister were the office and council of the minister. The apparatus of the ministry consisted of several departments, divided into departments, which, in turn, were divided into tables. The rigid principle of unity of command was established. The minister obeyed the emperor, being appointed and deposed of his choice. Directly to the Minister were the directors of departments and offices. Heads of departments were subordinate to department directors. The heads of the departments were subordinate to the heads of the capitals. Thus, in the years 1810‚Äì1812, the legal foundations were laid and the sectoral management system in the country was created. The further development of the ministries was already built taking into account the managerial needs of the state. Changes in the composition of ministries in the first half of the 19th century were associated with the search for the most rational system of central administration of the empire. All the parts of Speransky's transformational plan that were implemented belong to the central administration, and it was their implementation that informed the latter of a more harmonious appearance. This was the second, more decisive phase on the establishment of a new state order, which was preceded by two private measures that had an internal connection with the forthcoming reforms, as they set the spirit and direction of this reform, indicating what kind of people are required for new government institutions. On April 3, 1809, the Decree on the Court Ranks was issued. This document changed the position of the nobles who wore the ranks of chamberlain and chamber junker, who did not combine with certain and permanent official duties, but provided important advantages. The decree ordered everyone who wore these ranks, but were not in any service, to enter such a service within two months, stating which department they wished to serve in. Themselves these ranks henceforth became a simple distinction, not connected with any official rights. The decree on August 6 of the same year established the procedure for the production of civil ranks of a college assessor (8th grade) and a state adviser (5th grade). These ranks, which largely determined the appointment, were acquired not only by merit, but also by simple length of service, that is, the established service life. The new decree banned the production of employees who did not have a certificate of completion at one of the Russian universities or did not pass the exam at the university according to the established program, which was attached to the decree. Under this program, those who wanted to receive the rank of college assessor or state adviser were required to know the Russian language and one of the foreign languages, knowledge of the rights of natural, Roman and civil, state economy and criminal laws, a thorough acquaintance with domestic history and basic information in the history of general, in the statistics of Russian states, in geography, even in mathematics and physics. On January 1, 1810, the transformed State Council was opened.

It is the only underground stop of the line, excluding the Flaminio terminus. The official name of the facility is Stazione Euclide, as shown on the signs visible from the square; in the past, however, it was indicated on the railway timetables as Roma P. EuclideLa metropolitana a Roma, cited work, p. 229-231. or, in another source, as p.za Euclide.  Location  The stop is located in the urban track of Rome, in Piazza Euclide, in the quarter Pinciano on the border with the quarter Parioli; it is accessed from one of the buildings located on the square, on the corner with Via Civinini, in front of the Basilica of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. The platforms are accessed via a first flight of stairs leading to the mezzanine, followed by two further flights leading to the two side platformsStazioni dal Mondo . It is one of the stops of the line that record the most traffic, since it is located in a densely inhabited area with a high number of offices. The facility serves the residential quarters Parioli and Pinciano.  History  In 1947 the city administration of Rome requested the construction of a stop on the underground section of the Rome‚ÄìCivitacastellana‚ÄìViterbo railway, then under renovation to double it. The location of Piazza Euclide was chosen, since it represented an important traffic junction for the quarters Flaminio and Parioli. The project was approved by the Higher Council for Public Works in 1948, but it took until March 1952 to obtain the ministerial decree authorizing the work. The construction therefore began in 1953 and the stop was inaugurated on 15 January 1958Tramroma ‚Äì La ferrovia Roma-Civitacastellana-Viterbo 1932‚Äì1976. The total cost was around 500 million lire. In the summer of 2009 the station was closed due to renovation and upgrading works that affected the whole urban section of the line; during the approximately 70 days of interruption, the platforms were raised to achieve the ground-level boarding; furthermore, the architectural barriers were eliminated thanks to the installation of stairlifts and the creation of guided paths for partially sighted people. The fire-fighting system was also renewed and a new lighting system was installed as well.

History MASI was founded in 2014 after the protests in Direct Provision Centres to give a voice and advocate for those living in Direct Provision and seeking asylum in Ireland. One of the founding members of MASI was Lucky Khambule. They argue that the privatised nature of Direct Provision Centres in Ireland result in chronic issues regarding health, hygiene, and civil and human rights of those housed there. They held their first conference in Liberty Hall, Dublin in October 2019, with a keynote from MASI spokesperson Bulelani Mfaco. Alongside Irish Refugee Council and Nasc, MASI is one of the groups represented on the independent advisory group reviewing Direct Provision due to finish its report in late 2020. Core activities MASI have a set of core goals: * To bring together and create a platform for asylum seekers in Ireland * Strives for justice, freedom, and dignity for asylum seekers * Calls for the end of Direct Provision * Demands the rights of asylum seekers to work and be educated * Opposes deportation * Is independent and not affiliated with any NGOs or political parties * Is funded through individuals' resources and fundraising, and does not receive funding * Advocates for equality for all * Works as a democratic collective, making all decisions as a group * No formal \\"membership\\" * No organisational structure In 2020, MASI have highlighted the systemic issues around the management and containment of COVID-19 in Direct Provision centres across Ireland, due to problems regarding the inability for people to self-isolate, over-crowding, and lack of facilities for families and children. Some of these centres have been individually identified as having on-going issues, including in Cahersiveen, Miltown Malbay, and Portarlington. MASI alongside Nasc, the Sanctuary Runners, Doras, Irish Refugee Council, and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, called for all vulnerable and at-risk migrants be removed from Direct Provision centres. MASI, with Black Pride Ireland and Migrants and Ethnic-minorities for Reproductive Justice, have been involved in organising Black Lives Matter protests and demonstrations in response to the killing of George Floyd in Ireland in June 2020. This has come under criticism by the minister for health and the head of the National Public Health Emergency Team as contravening the COVID-19 restrictions on movement and mass gatherings.

Liquor laws prevented bars from knowingly selling alcoholic beverages to gay patrons, so police departments commonly demanded payoffs from gay bar owners as a way to prevent shutdowns and raids. San Francisco According to historian Christopher Agee, the San Francisco Police Department in the 1950s \\"maintained a decentralized organizational structure that gave patrol officers great autonomy in their daily activities. Police leaders prioritized their own political power over professional policing, and they therefore refused to either coordinate their policies across station lines or add the supervisory positions needed to monitor the officers on the beat.\\" As a result, policing in the city was subjective and disproportionately targeted the city's black and gay populations. The 1951 California Supreme Court case Stoumen v. Reilly found bars and establishments could legally cater to homosexual clientele. The majority opinion ruled in favor of the Black Cat Bar, a popular bohemian and gay hangout. Phil S. Gibson wrote, \\"Unlike evidence that an establishment is reputed to be a house of prostitution, which means a place where prostitution is practiced and thus necessarily implies the doing of illegal or immoral acts on the premises, testimony that a restaurant and bar is reputed to be a meeting place for a certain class of persons contains no such implication.\\" Regardless of the court's decision, the San Francisco Police Department's officers continued to demand payments from gay bar owners in order for them to avoid raids. Bob Ross, who would go on to found the Tavern Guild, an organization which helped dismantle the Gayola system in San Francisco, was quoted by Christopher Agee, saying: > [Upon entering, the police officer asked,] \\"Hi Bob, are you the manager?\\" > And I'd say, \\"Why yes.\\" \\"Hi, I'm Lieutenant So-and-so.\\" \\"You don't say, > Lieutenant So-and-so.\\" \\"Yes, the San Francisco Police Department.\\" And right > away you'd go \\"Oh shit.\\" You know, \\"What are we up to now?\\" And the first > time he came in he was soliciting for the . . . Police Athletic League. And > I said, \\"Oh.\\" I said, \\"I just sent them $25 or something.\\" And he said, > \\"Oh.\\" He said, \\"This is actually the Police Officer's Retirement League > section of the Police Athletic League.\\" I said, \\"I never heard of that.\\" He > said, \\"You will; let me show you.\\" And I said, \\"What do you need, $100?\\" He > says, \\"No, it's gonna be $500 a month.\\" And he says, \\"The captain'll be by > to collect it next Tuesday at 7:30.\\" That's how brazen they were. The > captain walked in at 7:30 to collect his money.\\" According to Ross, he also needed to buy dinner for the captain and provide him a female prostitute. This corruption was allowed due to SFPD's decentralized structure. In 1950s' San Francisco, district station captains held substantial political power. Police officers aided conservative politicians in the city, \\"allowing thugs to intimidate voters in precincts with large black or liberal voting populations.\\" As a result, there was little incentive on the part of downtown elites to demand substantial police reform against corruption, and even if they were so inclined, it would have proved difficult, as the Gayola system was largely operating at the ground level, rather than a high brass operation. In his historical analysis of the period, Agee writes, \\"As the only officers who left their desks and monitored the patrolmen on the streets, the department's two hundred sergeants held the most policing power in the SFPD. It was therefore the SFPD's two hundred sergeants who exerted the most control over the department's gay bar policies.\\" Serious changes would not occur until the early-1960s, when the \\"gayola scandal\\" raised public awareness of this practice. A group of gay bar owners revealed the SFPD's practice of extortion, and this made front page news. Mayor George Christopher came out publicly against the practice. The new reform-oriented chief of police, police professionalization organizations, and the gay civil rights movement collectively pushed to end the Gayola practice. New York Gayola was also a common practice for New York City's gay bars in the mid- century.

The police abolition movement is a political movement, largely in the United States, that advocates replacing policing with other systems of public safety. Police abolitionists believe that policing, as a system, is inherently flawed and cannot be reformed‚Äîa view that rejects the ideology of police reformists. While reformists seek to address the ways in which policing occurs, abolitionists seek to transform policing altogether through a process of disbanding, disempowering, and disarming the police. Abolitionists argue that the institution of policing is deeply rooted in a history of white supremacy and settler colonialism, and that it is inseparable from a pre-existing racial capitalist order. Therefore, they say, a reformist reform approach to policing will always fail. Police abolition is a process that requires communities to create alternatives to policing. This process involves the deconstruction of the preconceived understandings of policing and resisting co-option by reformists. It also involves engaging in and supporting practices that reduce police power and legitimacy, such as defunding the police. In the George Floyd protests, Black Lives Matter and other activists used the phrase \\"defund the police.\\" The defunding movement advocates the reduction in police department budgets or the delegation of certain police responsibilities to other organizations. Some activists have proposed the diversion of police funds to social services, such as youth or housing services. The phrase \\"fuck the police,\\" which according to researchers David Correia and Tyler Wall \\"emerged as the unofficial motto\\" during the Rodney King riots, may be understood as a call for police abolition. Police abolition has been criticized by some sociologists, criminologists, journalists, and politicians.  Ideology  Abolitionists argue that American policing is rooted in a history of colonialism and slavery. Some of the first police organizations in the United States developed from early alt= Police abolition is founded on the idea that police, as they exist in society, are harmful to the people and must therefore be abolished. Abolitionists push back against reformists who, as Correia and Wall describe, \\"refuse to even consider that a world without police and private property might actually be a safer and more democratic world than the one we know today [and] never get tired of telling poor communities, routinely terrorized by police, to simply be patient, follow police orders, and work hard to escape the ghetto.\\" Correia and Wall write that \\"whether in Detroit in 1967 or Ferguson in 2014, insurgent movements of poor Black and Brown people know that police reform always leads to more criminalization, harassment, arrest, and police killing in their communities.\\" As described by James Baldwin, the \\"pious calls to 'respect the law,' always to be heard from prominent citizens each time the ghetto explodes, are so obscene.\\" Baldwin asserted an anti-reformist stance, stating that poverty and police violence in Black communities will continue \\"no matter how many liberal speeches are made, no matter how many lofty editorials are written, no matter how many civil rights commissions are set up.\\" Abolitionists argue that policing in the United States is rooted in colonialism and slavery and therefore cannot be reformed. As summarized by Mahesh Nalla and Graeme Newman: \\"Many policing problems plagued the new cities of America. They included controlling certain classes, including slaves and Indians; maintaining order; regulating specialized functions such as selling in the market, delivering goods, making bread, packing goods for export; maintaining health and sanitation; ensuring the orderly use of the streets by vehicles; controlling liquor; controlling gambling and vice; controlling weapons; managing pests and other animals.\\" Early policing in America had little to do with crime control and was performed by groups of \\"volunteer citizens who served on slave patrols or night watches,\\" as recorded by Victor Kappeler and Larry Gaines. Modern police organizations in the United States were developed from these early slave patrols and night watches. For example, \\"New England settlers appointed Indian constables to police Native Americans,\\" while \\"in 1704 the colony of Carolina developed the nation's first slave patrol,\\" organized groups which would go on to exist in southern and northern states. Even police and prison abolition is considered by abolitionists as \\"not a definitive end, because police and prisons lie at the heart of the capitalist state, which is always evolving, adapting, and reconstituting itself in response to resistance and insurgency.\\" As stated by Luis Fernandez, professor of criminology, \\"asking the question 'what are alternatives to policing?' is to ask the question 'what are alternatives to capitalism?'\\" Fernandez identifies that \\"the role of the police is to maintain the capitalist social order, to maintain the social order so that those particular people who have power can do their business with the least amount of disruption... possible.\\" From this perspective, abolition of the police and prisons in the United States is inherently intertwined with undoing the racial capitalist order. As stated by Joshua Briond for Hampton Institute, \\"Black death is a necessity of racial capitalism and the institutions (such as policing and prisons) that exist to uphold it.\\" As a result, Briond concludes that \\"the only realistic solution to a reality in which anti-Black terror, violence, and death is an inevitability to the functionality of a system, is abolition.\\"  Abolition as a process  Police abolitionists see abolition as a process of disbanding, disempowering, and disarming the police in the transition to a society without police. This may take several forms for abolitionists, such as imagining alternatives to policing, directly challenging the legitimacy and roles of policing, resisting liberal attempts to co-opt, incorporate, or reconcile the uncompromising objective to abolish the police, and engaging in practices which undermine the authority and power of the police, such as the defunding the police. As stated by academic Alex S. Vitale, police abolition is a process, rather than a singular event: > Well, I'm certainly not talking about any kind of scenario where tomorrow > someone just flips a switch and there are no police. What I'm talking about > is the systematic questioning of the specific roles that police currently > undertake, and attempting to develop evidence-based alternatives so that we > can dial back our reliance on them. And my feeling is that this encompasses > actually the vast majority of what police do. We have better alternatives > for them. Even if you take something like burglary ‚Äî a huge amount of > burglary activity is driven by drug use. And we need to completely rethink > our approach to drugs so that property crime isn't the primary way that > people access drugs. We don't have any part of this country that has high- > quality medical drug treatment on demand. But we have policing on demand > everywhere. And it's not working. = Creating alternatives = Joshua Briond states that \\"the lack of political imagination, beyond the electoral strategy and reformism, and the inability to envision a world, or even country, devoid of police and prisons is rooted in (anti-Black), racialized colonial logics of the biologically determined criminal, slave, and savage.\\" In opposition to the position that police abolition is inconceivable, abolitionists support creating alternatives to policing. Activist Tourmaline references Andrea Ritchie to explain how \\"people act with abolitionist politics all the time, without actually knowing it.\\" Ritchie presented the following example to illustrate this point: \\"You and your friend are at a bar. Your friend drove there. Your friend wants to drive home. Are you gonna call the cops or are you going to say 'no, I'll drive you home; I'll call a cab; I will take your keys'?\\" Tourmaline states that this is an example of \\"abolition at work,\\" since \\"people are not constantly calling the cops on their friends to prevent them from drunk driving; people are finding unique and creative ways to get their friends from not driving while they're drunk.\\" In response, lawyer and activist Dean Spade states that \\"it seems like a big part of an example like that is the difference between how we feel about somebody we know‚Äîlike, you're about to commit a crime, you're about to get in a car and drive drunk, but it never occurs to me that I should call the cops on you, because I don't see you as disposable, I know you‚Äîversus, [a scenario where] there's strangers on the subway and somebody's doing something that someone doesn't like and instead of figuring out what's going on or [questioning] can this be stopped, can this be less harmful, or can people get taken care of, there's a kind of immediate\\" response to make it \\"into a police problem.\\" Spade says that this occurs because of the ways in which \\"people are alienated from one another in our culture\\" which has made it socially \\"not okay\\" to \\"connect and try to figure out how to solve the problem\\" together. In response, Rachel Herzing suggests that we learn from people who have developed and proposed alternative strategies which rely on community development, networking and negotiation, group self-defense learning, workbooks and other materials which present alternatives for people who are unsure of what alternatives may exist, citing Fumbling Towards Repair by Mariame Kaba and Shira Hassan and Beyond Survival: Strategies and Stories from the Transformative Justice Movement, edited by Ejeris Dixon and Leah Lakshmi. = Delegitimizing the police = Protests in Raleigh, North Carolina on May 30, 2020 Abolitionists argue that delegitimizing the police as an institution of society and deconstructing the logic of policing are necessary towards actualizing police abolition. Megan McDowell and Luis Fernandez state that \\"by attacking the police as an institution, by challenging its very right to exist, the contemporary abolitionist movement contains the potential to radically transform society.\\" Dean Spade states that \\"clearly US policing has been having a major legitimacy crisis because of the Black Lives Matter movement.\\" However, Spade cites Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Craig Gilmore's article \\"Beyond Bratton\\" in Policing the Planet in order to express how legitimacy crises historically have often actually resulted in the expansion of policing: \\"In the U.S., after the crisis in the 1960s and 70s that was provoked by the Black Panther Party, the Young Lords, and so many different anti-racist and anti-colonial movements calling out the police and more people seeing police violence and seeing the police as racist, the police just did a lot of new PR moves, like they expanded police to have police be homeless outreach workers and to have police go into every classroom in the United States and do a drug abuse education program called D.A.R.E.\\" As a result, Spade concludes that \\"the idea that just because we provoke a [legitimacy] crisis we'll get a reduction or elimination is something we have to really question.\\" = Resisting co-option = Abolitionists believe that calls for abolition may be co-opted and drained of their power by reformists who propose reforms which actually function to strengthen police power. Tourmaline argues that this process of expecting the state to reduce harm and violence through increasing policing is embedded within the state's attempts to maintain its own legitimacy and power: \\"the logic of the state is constantly demanding us to think of ways to increase policing as a way to decrease harm and violence.\\" Megan McDowell and Luis Fernandez state that an abolitionist praxis which \\"adopts uncompromising positions that resist liberal attempts at co-optation, incorporation, and/or reconciliation\\" should be adopted and amplified as a result. The Ferguson unrest reform proposal of body cameras for police has been cited as an example of a reformist approach to policing which worked to strengthen police power and build wealth for the less than lethal weapons industry while failing to provide material relief to those impacted by police violence. Dean Spade argues that \\"the goal of those kinds of reforms is to demobilize us, to tell us 'your problem has been solved' ... and that is so important for us to deeply resist.\\" Mariame Kaba argues that reform will always be a failed project when it comes to police, because police have the power to execute state power without any limitations: \\"How are we going to reform an institution that basically has the ability to decide whether or not to use violence in any conceivable situation and is sanctioned by the state to do so?\\" Kaba points to examples which illustrate how police are not accountable to the law, but engage in the work of maintaining order rather than in enforcing the law. = Divest and invest = George Floyd protest holds up a sign calling for defunding the police, a step in police abolition.alt= Defunding the police can be considered as a step towards abolition, by using funds allocated to police to invest in community initiatives intended to reduce crime and therefore the need for policing over time until the institution is fully abolished. Such initiatives could include social workers, mental health therapy, domestic abuse centres, drug counselling, and low cost housing. For instance, in Oakland, California, the police budget is over 40% of the city's discretionary spending. In many US cities the police department is the largest single budget item. Defunding the police frees up funds to invest in community initiatives intended to reduce crime and therefore the need for policing. Activist and advocacy groups like Movement 4 Black Lives call for \\"divest/invest\\" programs to divert police budgets into programs that have been proven to reduce crime. According to Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, \\"We're ready to chip away at the line items inside of a police budget that really are nonsensical. Police should not be in charge of mental health crises. They should not be in charge of dealing with homelessness. They should not be in charge of 'supporting' people with drug dependency and addiction. Those are three line items which we can cut out of the police budget and then put that back into health care.\\" In Eugene, Oregon, a nonprofit mobile crisis intervention program called CAHOOTS has handled mental health calls since 1989 and is often cited as a model for an alternative to police handling mental health calls. In 2019 CAHOOTS responded to 20% of Eugene's 911 calls on a budget of $2 million. In 2012, Camden, New Jersey‚Äîthen referred to as \\"the most dangerous city in the United States\\"‚Äî defunded its police department. The city had numerous problems with police corruption and many instances in which police would plant drugs on citizens. As a result, the city disbanded the police department and created a new one under county control, which allowed for funds to be reallocated to community-building initiatives. The new department had more officers, but their roles were reframed to be community-oriented and focused on de-escalating violence. A seven-year study showed that violent crime dropped 42% and the crime rate dropped from 79 per 1,000 to 44 per 1,000. Camden dropped down the list of most dangerous cities in the U.S. to tenth.  History  The United States established its first militarized police force in Pennsylvania in 1905, directly influenced by imperialist American warfare conducted by the Philippine Constabulary. The Pennsylvania State Police were created by Samuel W. Pennypacker, who intended for the force to serve as a means \\"to crush disorders, whether industrial or otherwise, which arose in the foreigner-filled districts of the state.\\" Virtually all of the officers were drawn from the U.S. military, many coming directly from the Constabulary. While the state police force was \\"supposedly statewide\\" in name, \\"the force was actually deployed in four troops to cover the mining districts,\\" which were highly populated by \\"foreigners.\\" Nearly all of the troopers were \\"American born and their motto was 'One American can lick a hundred foreigners,' as recorded by historian Thomas Reppetto. \\" They referred to themselves as the Black Hussars and were referred to colloquially as \\"Cossacks.\\" As early as 1906, the state police were already stirring resentment by shooting labor strikers and escaping accountability. In 1906, troopers shot twenty strikers in Mount Carmel. Although the lieutenant in command was arrested for assault and battery, \\"the state exonerated him and his men of all charges.\\" Governor Pennypacker expressed support, stating that the troopers had \\"established a reputation which has gone all over the Country... with the result that the labor difficulties in the Anthracite coal region entirely disappeared.\\" The state police were commonly called in to suppress labor strike activity, were used as a weapon of the elite class in Pennsylvania, and regularly escaped repercussions for their actions. As stated by Jesse Garwood, \\"A [state] policeman can arrest anybody, anytime.\\" The United Mine Workers \\"pressed for the abolition of this 'Cossack' force,\\" but retreated during World War I when more transformative labor organizing from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) arose in the region. Although they had supported abolition for nearly a decade, the United Mine Workers were satisfied when a raid was conducted on an IWW meeting in 1916 in Old Forge. All 262 people present were arrested, and \\"after the release of some undercover informants, the rest were sentenced to thirty days.\\" Immigration to the United States heavily declined in 1914, which resulted in some mining communities becoming more Americanized. As a result, \\"Pennsylvania's industrial belt was no longer a land of cultural deviance, but just another rural slum.\\" A wider police abolitionist movement had emerged as a response to the violence inflicted by the public police and the private coal and iron police during a series of armed labor strikes and conflicts known as the Coal Wars (1890-1930). Throughout the period, there were numerous reports of miners being severely beaten and murdered by the public and private police. State police fired indiscriminately into tent cities, which resulted in the \\"killing or wounding of women and children,\\" and numerous inappropriateual assault and rapes committed by officers became common. After the firsthand witnessing of the beating of a 70-year-old citizen, American trade unionist James H. Maurer proposed legislation to abolish the public Pennsylvania State Police. In 1928, the ACLU issued a pamphlet entitled \\"The Shame of Pennsylvania,\\" declaring that thousands of public and private police had been \\"allowed to abuse their power without inquiry or punishment,\\" yet ultimately concluded that, without a \\"fearless governor,\\" abolishing the police was \\"not conceivable.\\" In 1929, the murder of Polish √©migr√© miner John Barcoski eventually resulted in the abolishment of Pennsylvania's private anti-labor Coal and Iron Police system in 1931. Barcoski was beaten to death by three officers employed by American banker Richard Beaty Mellon's Pittsburgh Coal Company. James Renshaw Cox, who worked with a coalition of civic, labor, and religious leaders to abolish the private police, referred to the agency as \\"tyranny by the wealthy industrial people.\\"  Outside the United States  Canada = On April 12, 2020, following two shootings by the Winnipeg Police Service, James Wilt published an article in Canadian Dimension, arguing that policing was increasing the criminalization of Indigenous Canadians and of the homeless, and that \\"an institution designed to displace, dispossess, and break apart families and communities in the interests of capital cannot provide 'justice.'\\" Wilt noted how much budget goes to policing and called for the Winnipeg Police to be disbanded and their budget spent on social services. = Europe = Law- enforcement abolition movements in Europe were most notable in the 1970s as the prison abolition movement, but the police abolition movement did not see similar levels of popularity. = Hong Kong = During the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, the abolition of the police is one of the request by the Hong Kong protestors. The slogan \\"Disband the Police Force immediately\\" () appears in many areas during the protest.  Contemporary responses  Social scientists = According to Princeton sociologist Patrick Sharkey, the best scientific evidence available shows that police are effective in reducing violence, while there is also a growing body of evidence that community organizations can play a central role in reducing violence: Criminologists Justin Nix and Scott Wolfe state in the Washington Post, \\"We have enough research evidence to be concerned about the immediate impact of drastic budget cuts or wholesale disbanding of police agencies: Crime and victimization will increase....These collateral consequences will disproportionately harm minority communities that need help, not further marginalization.\\" They go on to state that \\"Cities that have more police officers per capita tend to have lower crime rates. This does not necessarily mean we need to hire more police. Rather, having more officers per capita provides greater ability to dedicate resources to community- and problem-oriented policing approaches that have been shown to reduce crime and improve community satisfaction.\\" They further argue that police departments need to be held more accountable for their use of funds, suggesting more emphasis on evidence-based practices, and say that making the police responsible for so many social ills should be reconsidered, although stating the infrastructure to handle those should be in place before reallocating funds. = Media = Matthew Yglesias, writing in Vox, criticized police abolition activists for lacking a plan for how to deal with violent crime, and for ignoring the substantial literature finding that having more police leads to less violent crime. He stated that their dismissal of police reform ignores that even modest reforms have been shown to reduce police misconduct. He writes that across government as a whole, only a very small portion of spending goes to police, and that while more social spending would probably reduce crime, that does not need to come out of police budgets, noting that the United States actually has 35% fewer police officers per capita than the rest of the world. He also states that abolishing public police services would lead to a surge in the use of private security services by those who can afford them, and that such services would lack accountability. = Public opinion = The contemporary police abolition movement began at least as early as 2014 during the Ferguson riots but gained strength in 2020 during the aftermath of the death of George Floyd and the protests surrounding it. A YouGov poll from May 29‚Äì30, 2020, found that \\"most Americans do not support reducing law enforcement budgets. Close to two-thirds (65%) oppose cutting police force funding. Just 16 percent of Democrats and 15 percent of Republicans support that idea.\\" An Economist/YouGov poll from June 14‚Äì16, 2020, found that 22 percent of African-Americans favor police abolition. A June 23-July 6 survey by Gallup found that 81% of African- Americans wanted police to spend the same amount of time or more time in their neighborhoods, as did 86% of the sample as a whole. = Politicians = U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden does not support defunding or abolishing the police. Many members of the United States House of Representatives have criticized the movement as a distraction from other efforts, notably Karen Bass, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn warned Democratic leaders against engaging in the movement on a private call, over fears that Republicans could propagandize the controversy during the upcoming US election season. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders opposed police abolition, stating that all cities in the world have police; instead, he argued that that police departments should be staffed with \\"well-educated, well-trained, well-paid professionals,\\" stating \\"we want to redefine what police departments do, give them the support they need to make their jobs better\\" while ensuring \\"every police officer in this country [is held] accountable for what he or she does.\\" President Donald Trump criticized the efforts to defund police departments and said it was important to have \\"law and order\\" in the United States. According to Attorney General William P. Barr, there would be an increase in \\"vigilantism\\" and \\"more killings\\" in major American cities. = Cities = \\"Abolish the police\\" graffiti in Minneapolis, MN (June 2020) According to the New York Times, cities across the United States were considering defunding, downsizing, or abolishing their departments in the Floyd aftermath. In Minneapolis, advocacy group MPD150, which had previously published a report in 2017 recommending the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) be abolished, argued that \\"the people who respond to crises in our community should be the people who are best-equipped to deal with those crises\\" and that first responders should be social workers and mental health providers. Public schools, parks, multiple private businesses and venues, and the University of Minnesota have severed ties with the police department. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey was booed by a large crowd of protestors after refusing to defund and abolish the police. Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council‚Äîa veto-proof majority‚Äîpledged on June 7, 2020 to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department, despite opposition from Mayor Frey. Supporters of the pledge included Alondra Cano, Jeremiah Ellison, and council president Lisa Bender. U.S. representative Ilhan Omar, whose district includes Minneapolis, stated, \\"the Minneapolis Police Department has proven themselves beyond reform. It's time to disband them and reimagine public safety in Minneapolis.\\" A few weeks after the pledge, the City Council passed a provision for a public referendum to amend the city's charter to do so, as the charter required the city to ‚Äúfund a police force of at least 0.0017 employees per resident.‚Äù The proposed amendment was blocked by the Charter Commission, who said it lacked legal provisions and necessary public input, although it may go before voters in 2021. In September, the pledge to abolish the department was set aside. Elected officials said there was widespread disagreement about its meaning, even at the time the pledge was taken. Lisa Bender said that different interpretations of the pledge by different council members had created confusion. The New York Times reported that the pledge \\"has been rejected by the city's mayor, a plurality of residents in recent public opinion polls, and an increasing number of community groups. Taking its place have been the types of incremental reforms that the city‚Äôs progressive politicians had denounced.\\" On June 8, 2020, the police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone was established in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. The New York Times described the six-block Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in Seattle as an example of police abolition put into practice, because police did not respond to calls in the zone and the local precinct was closed. They reported that the zone had its own self-appointed armed guards, and described cases of harassment and intimidation of businesses and customers, as well as vandalism. Business within the zone crashed. There were four shootings in the zone, two of them fatal, before the police retook the zone.

The publication was associated primarily with Paul Robeson, whose column, with his photograph, ran on most of its front pages. Freedom's' motto was: \\"Where one is enslaved, all are in chains!\\" The newspaper has been described as \\"the most visible African American Left cultural institution during the early 1950s.\\" In another characterization, \\"Freedom paper was basically an attempt by a small group of black activists, most of them Communists, to provide Robeson with a base in Harlem and a means of reaching his public... The paper offered more coverage of the labor movement than nearly any other publication, particularly of the left-led unions that were expelled from the CIO in the late 1940s... [It] encouraged its African American readership to identify its struggles with anti-colonial movements in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. Freedom gave extensive publicity to... the struggle against apartheid.\\" Quoted in and History Freedom was planned as a joint venture by Robeson and W. E. B. Du Bois. It was named after Freedom's Journal, the first Black newspaper published in the United States. Louis Burnham, the former executive secretary of the Southern Negro Youth Congress (SNYC), was the Managing Editor of Freedom. Burnham was responsible for getting the monthly started. George B. Murphy Jr. (vice chairman of the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born and vice president of the International Workers Order), was the general manager. The monthly shared office space and staff with the Council on African Affairs. Each issue cost $0.10; a subscription for a year was $1. When Lorraine Hansberry, later a Tony award-winning playwright but then (in her own description) a confused 21 year old, went to work for Freedom soon after its founding, she found \\"an office furnished with two desks, one typewriter and a remarkably enthusiastic working staff of two\\": Louis Burnham, the editor, and Edith Roberts, the office manager. The periodical became a magnet for primarily African-American leftist activists and artists, including Esther Cooper Jackson, former SNYC executive Edward Strong, historian Herbert Aptheker, members of the New York Negro Labor Council and members of the Committee for the Negro in the Arts, including Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Harry Belafonte. It promoted African-American culture, showcasing, among others, playwright Lorraine Hansberry, playwright and fiction writer Alice Childress (whose novel Like One of the Family first appeared serially in Freedom), novelists Lloyd Brown, Julian Mayfield, and John O. Killens, and poet Frank Marshall Davis. Alice Childress recalled \\"Eslanda Robeson bringing in the works of young artists, introducing them to the editor, asking him to give them an opportunity to present their talents in Freedom.\\" It supported the working class and the labor movement, as well as a variety of international issues, including world peace, human rights in Latin America, and the anti-colonial freedom struggle. It advocated for third-party politics. A rarity among American newspapers, Freedom consistently opposed the Korean War, linking the conflict to colonialism, discrimination against Black people in the armed forces, and Jim Crow laws at home. Presciently, in a front page Freedom column, \\"Ho Chi Minh is Toussaint L'Ouverture of Indo China,\\" Robeson asked [emphasis in the original]: \\"Shall Negro sharecroppers from Mississippi be sent to shoot down brown-skinned peasants in Vietnam‚Äîto serve the interests of those who oppose Negro liberation at home and colonial freedom abroad?\\" Women on the editorial board, and among its contributors. brought a proto-feminist viewpoint to Freedom, which published pieces expressing those views. Among these women were Vicki Garvin, whose article in the first issue began, \\"If it is true, as has often been stated, that a people can rise no higher than its women, then Negro people have a long way to go before reaching the ultimate goal of complete freedom and equality in the United States.\\" Lorraine Hansberry started at Freedom as a subscription clerk, and subsequently worked as receptionist, typist, editorial assistant and ultimately associate editor. Hansberry covered local, national, and international stories that involved both national and international travel. Other contributors included Childress, Dorothy Burnham and Eslanda Goode Robeson. Thelma Dale worked at the monthly. Shirley Graham Du Bois was part of the \\"Freedom Family\\" as the paper's associates referred to themselves. Freedom ceased publication after its July-August 1955 issue, which included an appeal for financial support on its front page. Ultimately, the monthly failed due not only to financial difficulties, but also to anti-communist FBI harassment. Because of McCarthyism, most Blacks were reluctant to have any association with Robeson or his publication. Although buying a Robeson concert ticket often included a subscription to Freedom, the FBI photographed attendees and recorded their license plate numbers, which would also especially discourage government employees. State and city governments prevented large venues from hosting Robeson, further limiting concert attendance to smaller facilities such as churches and union halls. Legacy Following the failure of Freedom, many of those associated with it were able to initiate another periodical, Freedomways. The new quarterly, energized by the revival of the Civil Rights Movement, maintained Freedom's anti-imperialist and anti-Jim Crow stance, while continuing to support Black culture and feminism. In its final issue, the editorial in Freedomways acknowledged the importance of its predecessor Freedom: \\"The titles of two ventures in publishing helped inspire our name‚Äîmost significantly, Freedom Newspaper, published by Paul Robeson and edited by Louis E. Burnham, which made such a valuable contribution to our movement in the ‚Äô50s.\\" See also *List of African-American newspapers in New York *List of African-American newspapers and media outlets ReferencesFurther reading * Includes Robeson's \\"Here's My Story\\" columns from Freedom.

Activists who use the phrase may do so with varying intentions; some seek modest reductions, while others argue for full defunding as a step toward the abolition of contemporary police services. Activists that support the defunding of police departments often argue that investing in community programs could provide a better crime deterrent for communities; funds would go toward addressing social issues, like poverty, homelessness, and mental disorders. Police abolitionists call for replacing existing police forces with other systems of public safety, like housing, employment, community health, education, and other programs. In June 2020, the \\"defund the police\\" slogan gained widespread popularity during the George Floyd protests. Black Lives Matter, Movement for Black Lives, and other activists have used the phrase to call for police budget reductions and to delegate certain police responsibilities to other organizations. In Black Reconstruction, first published in 1935, W. E. B. Du Bois wrote about \\"abolition-democracy\\", which advocated for the removal of institutions that were rooted in racist and repressive practices, including prisons, convict leasing, and white police forces. In the 1960s, activists such as Angela Davis advocated for the defunding or abolition of police departments. The End of Policing, written by Alex S. Vitale, was published in 2017, and it has been called \\"... a manual of sorts for the defund movement.\\" Some sociologists, criminologists, and journalists have criticized aspects of the police defunding movement.  Background  Sign protesting the Minneapolis Police Department on June 11, 2020 Since the 1960s, municipal governments have increasingly spent larger portions of their budgets on law enforcement. This is partially rooted in the \\"war on crime,\\" launched by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which prioritized crime control via law enforcement and prisons. Meanwhile, police unions have wielded significant power in local politics, due to direct endorsements of political candidates and funding of campaigns. Police department budgets have been considered \\"untouchable\\" for decades. By 2020, U.S. cities collectively spent approximately $115 billion per year on policing. For many cities, policing is their largest or near-largest expenditure. For example, in Los Angeles in 2020, the LAPD budget constituted about 18% of the city's budget ($1.86 billion out of $10.5 billion) and about 54% of the city's general funds (i.e., tax revenues that are not designated for special purposes). In Chicago in 2020, the CPD constituted about 18% of the city's budget and 40% of the city's general funds ($1.6 billion). In New York City in 2020, the NYPD budget constituted about 6% of the city's budget ($5.9 billion out of $97.8 billion), the third largest budget after the Department of Education and Social Services, but over 85% went to salaries and wages. In Oakland in 2018, about 41% of general funds went to the Oakland Police Department. In Minneapolis, the budget for the police and corrections departments grew 41% between 2009 and 2019. As of 2017, police spending has remained under 4 percent for the past 40 years. In 2017, over 95% went towards operational costs, such as salaries and benefits. While the officers per capita in major cities have not significantly changed, they have been equipped with more technology, gear, and training in the last few decades. On average, large cities spend about 8% of their general expenditures on policing, 5% on housing, and 3% on parks. Most cities' police budgets are larger than other public safety departments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where other budgets lessened but policing budgets were largely untouched.  Rationale  Effectiveness = SPD East Precinct inside the police-free Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle Police defunding and abolition activists argue that the police have a poor track record of resolving cases related to murder, rape, and domestic abuse. = Racism = Protest in Columbus, Ohio, on June 1, 2020 Critics argue that the history of policing is rooted in racist practices, including slave patrols, enforcement of Jim Crow laws, repression of the civil rights movement (such as the Selma to Montgomery marches), and the government‚Äôs violent campaign against Black Panthers leaders, such as Fred Hampton. = Unbundling of services = Protester in Minneapolis on June 11, 2020 Critics argue that police officers and police departments provide too many services. According to this argument, the United States has an over-reliance on law enforcement, which is expected to handle an unrealistically wide range of social issues, such as homelessness, mental health, and substance abuse. This model may be asking too much of police departments; some police officers have publicly expressed that they feel tasked to \\"do everything for everybody.\\" Meanwhile, police officers are trained to adopt a \\"warrior\\" mentality, which focuses on officer safety over community outreach. For these reasons, some activists have called for an unbundling of services. Under this model, many services that were previously provided by law enforcement would be provided by specialized response teams. These teams could include social workers, emergency medical technicians, conflict resolution specialists, restorative justice teams, and other community-based professionals. Police officers may be particularly badly suited for some community issues, such as mental health crises. For example, one study found that about 21% of police officer time is spent responding to or transporting people with mental illness. However, 1 in 4 people who are killed by the police have severe mental illness. Some activists argue that, if someone is experiencing a mental health crisis, and if there is no emergent threat to themselves or other people, mental health professionals may be more adept and capable responders. Furthermore, if more funds were diverted to help treat and support those with mental health issues, there could be better outcomes. While the movement is rooted primarily in the work of left-wing scholar activists in the 1970s, it has the support from many libertarians, though they rarely use the slogan \\"defund the police.\\" Libertarians support the movement out of a concern for constitutional rights and a stance against what they consider far-reaching and ever-expanding powers given to state actors (particularly qualified immunities).  Responses  Social scientists = According to Princeton sociologist Patrick Sharkey, the best evidence available shows that while police are effective in reducing violence, there is also a growing body of evidence that demonstrates community organizations can play a central role in reducing violence: In an interview with The Atlantic, Sharkey stated \\"Police presence can reduce violence, but there are lots of other things that reduce violence, too. Business improvement districts reduce violence. University security organizations reduce violence. It‚Äôs possible that relying on police isn‚Äôt as necessary as we once thought, and that we might even have safer communities without many of them.\\" In an interview with Vox, Sharkey acknowledged the effectiveness of aggressive policing and mass incarceration in reducing violence, but said these methods have \\"had staggering costs.\\" He went on to say \\"The next model should be one driven primarily by residents and local organizations as the central actors. Police still certainly have a role to play, but responding to violent crime takes up only a tiny fraction of police officers‚Äô time. So the idea here is that we can rely on residents and local organizations to take over most of the duties that [officers] currently handle and make sure neighborhoods are safe.\\" Criminologists Justin Nix and Scott Wolfe state in the Washington Post, \\"We have enough research evidence to be concerned about the immediate impact of drastic budget cuts or wholesale disbanding of police agencies: Crime and victimization will increase....These collateral consequences will disproportionately harm minority communities that need help, not further marginalization.\\" They go on to state that \\"Cities that have more police officers per capita tend to have lower crime rates. This does not necessarily mean we need to hire more police. Rather, having more officers per capita provides greater ability to dedicate resources to community- and problem- oriented policing approaches that have been shown to reduce crime and improve community satisfaction.\\" They further argue that police departments need to be held more accountable for their use of funds, suggesting more emphasis on evidence-based practices, and say that making the police responsible for so many social ills should be reconsidered, although stating the infrastructure to handle those should be in place before reallocating funds. Kevin Robinson, a retired police chief and lecturer of criminology and criminal justice at Arizona State University, suggests that the slogan \\"defund the police\\" is misguided. He states that a more appropriate terminology would be \\"re- allocation\\" of specific portions of police department budgets. He states that most such budgets are tight, but says that a thorough review of spending is always warranted, and that program effectiveness should determine whether or not a program is continued. He says that criminals usually weigh the possibility of getting caught when committing a crime, and that \\"if there is a low likelihood of apprehension there will be more crimes committed ‚Äî more people victimized.\\" He further states that \\"Studies have shown...that effective social programs can reduce criminality in adults and juveniles\\", and encourages police departments to incorporate social programs with police work. Sociologist Rashawn Ray, writing for the Brookings Institution, states that much of what police do is misaligned with their skillset and training, and suggests that a reduction in their workload would increase their ability to solve violent crimes. He further states: > One consistent finding in the social science literature is that if we really > want to reduce crime, education equity and the establishment of a work > infrastructure is the best approach. A study using 60 years of data found > that an increase in funding for police did not significantly relate to a > decrease in crime. Throwing more police on the street to solve a structural > problem is one of the reasons why people are protesting in the streets. > Defunding police‚Äîreallocating funding away from police departments to other > sectors of government‚Äîmay be more beneficial for reducing crime and police > violence. =Media= Matthew Yglesias, writing in Vox, criticized police defunding and abolition activists for lacking a plan for how to deal with violent crime, and for ignoring the substantial literature finding that having more police leads to less violent crime. He stated that their dismissal of police reform ignores that even modest reforms have been shown to reduce police misconduct. He writes that across government as a whole, only a very small portion of spending goes to the police, and that while more social spending would probably reduce crime, that does not need to come out of police budgets, noting that the United States actually has 35% fewer police officers per capita than the rest of the world. He also states that abolishing public police services would lead to a surge in the use of private security services by those who can afford them, and that such services would lack accountability. The slogan's relation to the Police abolition movement has been described as a motte-and-bailey fallacy by John Murawski at RealClearInvestigations. According to him, when \\"Defund the police\\" is criticized as tantamount to police abolition by opponents, proponents provide a moderate interpretation in terms of police demilitarization until the criticisms are addressed, only to return to more radical interpretations later. In light of the violence in New York City's streets, Al Sharpton has declaredhttps://thehill.com/homenews/media/515448-msnbcs-sharpton-defunding- police-something-a-latte-liberal-may-go-for : =Public opinion= A billboard calling for defunding the Baltimore Police Department on July 1 A YouGov opinion poll with fieldwork on May 29‚Äì30, 2020, found that less than 20% of American adults supported funding cuts for policing, with similar levels of support among Republicans and Democrats. In a poll conducted by ABC News/Ipsos of 686 participants, on June 10‚Äì11, 34% of US adults supported \\"the movement to 'defund the police'\\" and 64% opposed it. Support was higher among black Americans (57%) than among whites (26%) and Hispanics (42%), and higher among Democrats (55%) than among Republicans or Independents. A June 23‚ÄìJuly 6 survey by Gallup found that 81% of African Americans wanted police to spend the same amount of time or more time in their neighborhoods, as did 86% of the sample as a whole. = Politicians = Chalk graffiti in Washington, D.C. on June 9, 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden opposed defunding police forces, arguing instead that policing needed substantial reform. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders opposed defunding, arguing for more accountability for police, along with better education and training, and making their job better defined. U.S. Senator Cory Booker said he understood the sentiment behind the slogan but would not use it. U.S. Representative and Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass said, \\"I do think that, in cities, in states, we need to look at how we are spending the resources and invest more in our communities. Maybe this is an opportunity to re-envision public safety.\\" U.S. President Donald Trump on June 4, 2020, tweeted \\"The Radical Left Democrats new theme is \\"Defund the Police\\". Remember that when you don't want Crime, especially against you and your family. This is where Sleepy Joe is being dragged by the socialists. I am the complete opposite, more money for Law Enforcement! #LAWANDORDER\\". = Cities = \\"Defund Police\\" sign at a June 7, 2020 rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota In 2020, local policymakers in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and other US cities have supported some form of defunding or opposing budget increases. In New York City, activists and lawmakers asked Mayor Bill de Blasio in April 2020 to use cuts to the police budget to make up for shortfalls caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In June, during the Floyd protests, a group of 48 candidates for city office, along with Brooklyn College's Policing and Social Justice Project, asked the city council to reduce the NYPD budget by $1 billion over four years. City comptroller Scott Stringer said the city could save $1.1 billion over four years by cutting the numbers of police and reducing overtime and could divert the funds to \\"social workers, counselors, community-based violence interrupters, and other trained professionals.\\" On June 15, 2020, Police Commissioner Dermot Shea announced that the NYPD would eliminate its plainclothes police units in the precinct-level and Housing Bureau anti-crime teams, and the officers would be reassigned to community policing and detective work. As of August 2020, New York City had cut $1 billion from the police budget, but this mostly involved shifting some responsibilities to other city agencies, with the size of the force barely changing. Some black and Latino members of the city council opposed major cuts to policing, with the majority leader saying it was \\"colonization\\" pushed by white progressives, while others supported more cuts. Miami protest on June 7, 2020 In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti has said he would cut as much as $150 million from the Los Angeles Police Department's (LAPD) budget, a reversal of his planned increase of $120 million. Garcetti announced the funds would be redirected to community initiatives. In San Francisco, Mayor London Breed announced a plan to redirect some police funds to the city's African-American community, and she announced that police will no longer respond to non- criminal calls. In Milwaukee, an activist group called African-American Roundtable, formed by 65 organizations, asked the city to divert $75 million from the police budget to public health and housing. In Minneapolis, activist groups Reclaim the Block and Black Visions Collective requested for the police budget to be cut by $45 million. Members of the Minneapolis City Council signed a pledge to dismantle the police and create new public safety systems. City council member Lisa Bender explained, \\"Our commitment is to end policing as we know it and to recreate systems of public safety that actually keep us safe.\\" In September, the pledge was set aside. Pledge signer Andrew Johnson clarified that he had supported the pledge only in spirit, not literally. Lisa Bender, the council president, said that different interpretations of the pledge by different council members had created confusion. The New York Times reported that the pledge \\"has been rejected by the city's mayor, a plurality of residents in recent public opinion polls, and an increasing number of community groups. Taking its place have been the types of incremental reforms that the city's progressive politicians had denounced.\\" In Nashville on June 2, 2020, a city budget hearing lasted over ten hours to accommodate the large numbers of residents waiting to take their turn to ask the city to defund the police. In August 2020, the Austin City Council unanimously voted to cut $150 million, about one third, from the Austin Police Departments budget. About $80 million of the cuts consists of moving several civilian functions from the police department to other parts of city government, and $50 million is for \\"alternative forms of public safety\\". The other $20 million is to be reallocated to other city programs including violence prevention, abortion access, and food access. = Police unions = Protest in Los Angeles on June 6, 2020 US police unions have historically resisted even minor reforms and accountability measures including resisting repeal of qualified immunity.Eric Schnurer (17 June 2020). \\"Congress Is Going to Have to Repeal Qualified Immunity\\". The Atlantic.https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/congress-going- have-repeal-qualified-immunity/613123/ The Los Angeles Police Protective League said defunding the police would be the \\"quickest way to make our neighbourhoods more dangerous.\\" and that \\"at this time...'defunding' the LAPD is the most irresponsible thing anyone can propose.\\" = Outside the United States = The movement has spread to other countries. In Canada, politicians in major cities have expressed interest in diverting some police funds. In Toronto, city councilors Josh Matlow and Kristyn Wong-Tam have planned to propose a 10% cut to the police budget. In Montreal, Mayor Val√©rie Plante has said she is in talks about the police budget. In Scotland, a violence reduction unit was set up in 2005, which aims to prevent violence with educational and outreach programs.

It follows Sibil Fox Richardson, fighting for the release of her husband, Rob, who is serving a 60-year prison sentence. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020, where it won the U.S. Documentary Directing Award. It was released theatrically on October 9, 2020, and will be digitally on Prime Video on October 16, 2020, by Amazon Studios. Plot The film follows Sibil Fox Richardson (also known as Fox Rich), an entrepreneur, abolitionist, author, and mother of six, as she fights for the release of her husband, Rob, serving a 60-year prison sentence in the Louisiana State Penitentiary for armed bank robbery. Rich served three and a half years for her role in the robbery. The film combines original footage with home videos. Production Bradley met Rich in 2016, while working on her short film Alone, a New York Times Op-Doc. She originally set out to make a short documentary about Rich, but after shooting wrapped, Rich gave Bradley a bag of mini-DV tapes containing some 100 hours of home videos that she had recorded over the past 18 years. At that point, Bradley transitioned the short into a feature. Time was shot on a Sony FS7 camera and finished in black and white. It was selected for the 2019 Sundance Documentary Edit & Story Lab. The film score features original compositions by Jamieson Shaw and Edwin Montgomery, as well as music by Emahoy Tsegu√©-Maryam Gu√®brou that was recorded in the 1960s. The film was produced by Lauren Domino, Kellen Quinn, and Bradley.

The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Time delivers a powerful broadside against the flaws of the American justice system -- and chronicles one family's refusal to give up against all odds.\\" At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Peter Debruge of Variety wrote that the film \\"will almost certainly rewire how Americans think about the prison-industrial complex\\" as it \\"challenges the assumption that incarceration makes the world a safer place.\\" Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"gripping,\\" describing it as a \\"concise and impressionistic account of love and waiting, of the American justice system and the fight to keep a family whole.\\" David Ehrlich of Indiewire gave it an A- and wrote, \\"Bradley's monumental and enormously moving 'Time' doesn't juxtapose the pain of yesterday against the hope of tomorrow so much as it insists upon a perpetual now. And while the documentary never reduces its subjects to mere symbols of the oppression they represent - the film couldn't be more personal, and it builds to a moment of such unvarnished intimacy that you can hardly believe what you're watching.\\" Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times said the film is \\"a dazzling formal feat, but more than that, it's a profoundly sad movie about what it means to grow up without a father, to absorb that blow continually, day after day.\\" Ashley Clark of Filmmaker magazine wrote that the film's \\"graceful compositions, flowing sonic landscape and at times breathtaking interpolation of Fox Rich's home video archive footage cohere to form a singularly powerful experience.\\" =Accolades= At the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, Bradley won the Directing Award in the U.S. Documentary competition, becoming the first African American woman to win in the U.S. Documentary category.

After the war he published four works dealing with the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe. Early life Reuben Markham was born on a farm in Smith County, Kansas on February 21, 1887. His grandfather, Reuben Fuller Markham, and his father, Lucius Markham, were both Congregational ministers. During Reconstruction, Reuben Fuller Markham was a financial agent for the American Missionary Association, which founded eleven historically black colleges, including Beach Institute in Savannah, GA where he taught from 1875 to 1880. At 14, Reuben Henry Markham was sent to Washburn Academy in Topeka, where he also attended Washburn College, graduating in 1908, as valedictorian. The following year, he married Mary Gall, who had been the class salutatorian. Matriculating at Union Theological Seminary, Mr. Markham also received an M.A. in education from Columbia University. In 1912, Reuben too was ordained as a minister in the Congregational church. Years in Bulgaria That same year, Mr. and Mrs. Markham volunteered as missionary-educators for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in Samokov, Bulgaria, where the Board operated Western style Boys and Girls boarding schools on the same campus. Their three children, Eleonora, Helen and Jordan were born in Samokov. In 1918, the Markhams returned to America across war-torn Europe, in part to support the Congregational church's position that America not declare war on Bulgaria. Representing the American Board, Markham testified in front of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which decided to recommend American neutrality towards Bulgaria. After completing his testimony, he joined a government sponsored YMCA mission to provide agricultural expertise to Russia, but was turned back in Murmansk in 1918 by the revolutionary Soviet government. In order to finish the year of YMCA work, he assisted Russian prisoners of war in France. Mr. Markham returned to Bulgaria in 1920, where in addition to his teaching, he began to edit the Mission‚Äôs publications, using them to criticize the Bulgarian regime‚Äôs treatment of workers and peasants after a military coup in 1923. He ‚Äúwas forced to resign (from the Mission) in 1925‚Ä¶ as a result of his outspoken opposition to official persecution of the peasants.\\" Markham then started his own Bulgarian language newspaper, Svet, before it too was forced by the regime to shut down. Foreign Correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor From 1927 until his death in 1949, Reuben Markham worked primarily as a journalist for the Christian Science Monitor. After joining the Monitor's staff in 1927, he soon became correspondent for the Balkans. In 1931, he self-published Meet Bulgaria, describing Bulgarian history, economics and culture. In 1933, the Markhams moved from Sofia to Vienna, where Reuben became Central European correspondent. Here he was given several broader assignments as well. In 1935, he was sent to Ethiopia to cover the lead up to the Italian invasion. The following year, he travelled to the Holy Land, where he combined stories on current conditions with Biblical events. He turned this work into the Bulgarian language book, ‚ÄúThe Cradle of Humanity, Past and Present.\\" In 1938, Markham covered the Anschluss from Vienna, but afterwards moved his Monitor headquarters to Budapest. Returning to the United States in June, 1939 for a lecture tour and a series of articles for the Monitor entitled ‚ÄúRediscovering America,‚Äù the Markhams were caught by the outbreak of World War II and stayed in the country. For the next three years, he carried out assignments of feature articles about America, such as ‚ÄúMr. Markham Goes to Washington,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMr. Markham Polls the People.‚Äù World War II In March, 1941, Reuben Markham weighed in on ‚Äòthe Great Debate‚Äô over America‚Äôs entry into World War II, when he published The Wave of the Past, his rebuttal to Anne Morrow Lindbergh‚Äôs no. 1, non-fiction, best seller The Wave of the Future. She called her book ‚Äúa moral argument for isolationism.\\" In contrast, Markham argued that isolationism would lead to the loss of American freedom. \\"In this issue, there are only two sides. No neutral course remains...he either opposes the onslaught of Hitlerism or supports it. If he makes no choice, that is a choice; if he takes no action, he is on Hitler's side; if he does not act, that is an act--for Hitler.... To prevent that will be our first step. Whatever it may cost, we shall take it.\\" The Wave of the Past sold 70,000 copies in its first four months, making it too a best seller. By June, there were 123,000 copies printed, and it was mentioned by Eleanor Roosevelt in her daily column, My Day. \\"Another small book by an American who originally came from Kansas but has lived for many years in the Balkans is apparently inspired by Anne Lindbergh‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòThe Wave of the Future.‚Äô Mr. R.H. Markham writes ‚ÄòThe Wave of the Past‚Äô and insists ‚ÄòThe past has its mark and the future has its mark. The one is slavery and the other is freedom.‚Äô I think you will find both of these books of interest.\\" The Wave of the Past also states that \\"tyrants become world masters only when...men call...tyranny freedom.\\" Explaining how dictatorships distort reality by juxtaposing opposites, Markham wrote in an article at this time in the Monitor that ‚Äúthe multitudes are told that chains give freedom, that slavery is liberty, that war is peace, that the black resurging past is the future.‚Äù These concepts and phrasing anticipate the Ministry of Truth's slogans in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four: \\"WAR IS PEACE, SLAVERY IS FREEDOM, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\" . Once the United States entered the war, Reuben Markham was able to participate in the national effort by joining the Office of War Information (OWI) as the Deputy Director for the Balkans. In February, 1944, he returned to Europe, spending much of his time at a listening station in Bari, Italy. There he saw a great deal of the Partisan movement led by Communist Joseph Tito, and came to think it would install a dictatorial regime if it were to come to power. He wrote: ‚ÄúI spent many months among Yugoslav partisans and saw Commissars exercise the absolute power of gauleiters.‚Äù As a result, \\"he was one of the first to perceive what was happening in Eastern Europe in 1944.\\" When British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt threw their support to Tito, Markham believed it meant that the post-war Yugoslavia would become Communist, as might all of southeastern Europe. Unwilling to support this policy, Markham resigned from the government in October, 1944. The Director of OWI, Elmer Davis, explained, ‚ÄúEventually, he came to the conclusion that American policy in dealing with the Balkan countries‚Äîthe support of all elements, including the Communists, that were resisting the Germans‚Äîwas mistaken....The event proved that the policy which was followed led to precisely the unfortunate results which he foresaw.‚Äù The Cold War In 1945, after the war ended, the Monitor posted Markham to Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania where he wrote about Communist activities in Central and Southeastern Europe. The White House had also wanted to get him back into Eastern Europe, and once there, in addition to his journalism, he was able to send his findings directly to the President through the State Department's Mission in Sofia, Bulgaria, reporting that \\"the majority of Bulgaria considers itself in totalitarian prison.\\" In June, 1946, he was expelled from Romania and denied entrance to other Communist controlled nations. Meeting with reporters afterwards, Markham described one incident telling them that after covering a peasant party meeting that was broken up by a 'band of ruffians,' he had spent the night with \\"the local leader of the peasant party in Bucovina....Later the 'band of ruffians'...came into the house at midnight and killed the political leader with bursts of machine gun fire.\\" Shortly after his expulsion, on August 7, Markham met directly with President Truman at the White House. Markham was known for ‚Äúhis outspoken stand against communism,‚Äù writing and lecturing to warn the United States of the dangers of totalitarian Communist rule. He completed his book on Yugoslavia, Tito‚Äôs Imperial Communism, in 1947. Writing about Yugoslavia was challenging, not only over the question of whether or not to support Tito, but also because of Yugoslavia's ethnic animosities, which exploded in the 1990s. Markham himself wrote, \\"Practically every point treated in this book is controversial....\\" In its announcement of its publication, the University of North Carolina Press stated that this \\"book presents more fully than ever before the Serb point of view....\\" University of North Carolina Press. Summer Releases, 1947 A second work describing events in Eastern Europe, Rumania Under the Soviet Yoke came out in 1949. The New York Times wrote that Reuben Markham's volume ‚Äúpresents the facts of Soviet Communism in Rumania in stirring and human terms.‚Ä¶By writing about one country (of Eastern Europe) in detail and with understanding, Markham has written about them all.‚Äù In 1949, Markham also self published a pamphlet entitled Let Us Protestants Awake! that criticized Protestant church leaders who lent their support to Communist-led regimes in Europe. In May, 1949, Markham returned to government service on ‚Äúthe urgent insistence of Washington,‚Äù in the newly created Central Intelligence Agency.

Common scholarly questions include how the magnitude of modern polarization compares to various points in the past, and the extent to which polarization is a feature of American politics. Definition Polarization has been defined as both a process and a state of being. A defining aspect of polarization, though not its only facet, is a bimodal distribution around conflicting points of view or philosophies. In general, defining a threshold at which an issue is \\"polarized\\" is imprecise; detecting the trend of polarization, however, (increasing, decreasing, or stable) is more straight-forward. A related concept is that of party homogeneity, which describes the similarities of the constituencies of two officials of the same party. There is also party polarization, which refers to the gap between the typical constituency of one party as compared to the other in a two-party system. HistoryGilded Age= The Gilded Age of the late 19th century (c. 1870 - 1900) is considered to be one of the most politically polarized periods in American history, with open political violence and highly polarized political discourse. A key event during this era was the election of 1896, which some scholars say led to an era of one-party rule, created \\"safe seats\\" for elected officials to build careers as politicians, increased party homogeneity, and increased party polarization. Political polarization was overall heightened, with Republicans strengthening their hold on industrial areas, and Democrats losing ground in the North and upper Midwest. =1950s and 1960s= The 1950s and 1960s were marked by high levels of political bipartisanship, the results of a post-World War II \\"consensus\\" in American politics, as well as ideological diversity within each of the two major parties. =1990 - present= Media and political figures began espousing the narrative of polarization in the early 1990s, with a notable example Pat Buchanan's speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. In the speech, he declared a culture war for the future of the country. In 1994, the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. The narrative of political polarization became a recurring theme in the elections of 2000 and 2004. After George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, English historian Simon Schama noted that the US had not been so polarized since the American Civil War, and that a more apt name might be the Divided States of America. From 1994 to 2014, the share of Americans who expressed either \\"consistently liberal\\" or \\"consistently conservative\\" opinions doubled from 10% to 21%. In 1994, the average Republican was more conservative than 70% of Democrats, compared to more conservative than 94% of Democrats in 2014. The average Democrat went from more liberal than 64% of Republicans to more liberal than 92% of Republicans during the same era. Families, in contrast, are becoming more politically homogenous. As of 2018, 80% of marriages had spousal alignment on party affiliation. Parent-child agreement was 75%. Both of these represent significant increases from family homogeneity in the 1960s. Potential causesParty polarization= Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the United States Congress, where the majority party prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its party platform and political ideology. The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, Southern Democrats shifted toward the Republican Party, showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties. Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions. These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the United States House of Representatives‚Äîwhich political scientists Thomas E. Mann and Norman Ornstein refer to as Newt Gingrich's \\"guerrilla war.\\" What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as \\"party fit.\\" Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme. A study by Nicholson (2012) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party. As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances. Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through Super political action committees. Some, such as Washington Post opinion writer Robert Kaiser, argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization. Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns. These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes. =The public= In democracies and other representative governments, citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public's ideology and voting preferences. Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise. Fernbach, Rogers, Fox and Sloman (2013) argue that it is a result of people having an exaggerated faith in their understanding of complex issues. Asking people to explain their policy preferences in detail typically resulted in more moderate views. Simply asking them to list the reasons for their preferences did not result in any such moderation. Morris P. Fiorina (2006, 2008) posits the hypothesis that polarization is a phenomenon which does not hold for the public, and instead is formulated by commentators to draw further division in government. Other studies indicate that cultural differences focusing on ideological movements and geographical polarization within the United States constituency is correlated with rises in overall political polarization between 1972 and 2004. Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more moderate in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly evangelical candidate than Democratic voters. This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States. Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, coalition and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme. =Redistricting= The impact of redistricting‚Äîpotentially through Gerrymandering or the manipulation of electoral borders to favor a political party‚Äîon political polarization in the United States has been found to be minimal in research by leading political scientists. The logic for this minimal effect is twofold: first, gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region, while distributing the preferred party's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed. The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase, and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter, who tends to be more ideologically moderate. Second, political polarization has also occurred in the Senate, which does not experience redistricting because Senators represent fixed geographical units, i.e. states. The argument that redistricting, through gerrymandering, would contribute to political polarization is based on the idea that new non-competitive districts created would lead to the election of extremist candidates representing the supermajority party, with no accountability to the voice of the minority. One difficulty in testing this hypothesis is to disentangle gerrymandering effects from natural geographical sorting through individuals moving to congressional districts with a similar ideological makeup to their own. Carson et al. (2007), has found that redistricting has contributed to the greater level of polarization in the House of Representatives than in the Senate, however that this effect has been \\"relatively modest\\". Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994. =Media= A 2013 review concluded that there is no firm evidence that media institutions are contributing to the polarization of average Americans. No evidence supports the idea that longstanding news outlets are becoming increasingly partisan. Analyses confirm that the tone of evening news broadcasts remained unchanged from 1968 to 1996: largely centrist, with a small but constant bias towards Democratic Party positions. However, more partisan media pockets have emerged in blogs, talk radio, websites, and cable news channels, which are much more likely to use insulting language, mockery, and extremely dramatic reactions, collectively referred to as \\"outrage\\". People who have strongly partisan viewpoints are more likely to watch partisan news. Furthermore, a 2018 study highlights that there is no correlation between increased media and Internet consumption and increased political polarization. The data confirms a larger increase in polarization among individuals over 65 compared to those aged 18-39, revealing that Internet consumption is only a small factor in calculating the cause of political polarization. EffectsPolitical violence= Some authors have found a correlation between polarization of political discourse and the prevalence of political violence. = Trust in science = The General Social Survey periodically asks Americans whether they trust scientists. The proportion of American conservatives who say they place \\"a great deal of trust\\" in scientists fell from 48% in 1974 to 35% in 2010 and rose again to 39% in 2018. Liberals and independents, meanwhile, report different levels of trust in science. =Congress= Political polarization among elites is negatively correlated with legislative efficiency, which is defined by the total number of laws passed, as well as the number of \\"major enactments\\" and \\"key votes\\". Evidence suggests that polarization of political elites may more strongly affect efficiency than polarization of Congress itself, with authors hypothesizing that the personal relationships among members of Congress may enable them to reach compromises on polarized legislation, though not if political elites allow no leeway for such. Negative effects of polarization on the United States Congress include increased gridlock and partisanship at the cost of quality and quantity of passed legislation. It also incentivizes stall tactics and closed rules, such as filibusters on non-contentious issues and excluding minority party members from committee deliberations. These strategies hamper transparency, oversight, and the government's ability to handle long-term domestic issues, especially those regarding the distribution of benefits. Further, they foster animosity, as majority parties lose bipartisan and legislative coordination trying to expedite legislation to overcome them. Some scholars claim that political polarization is not so pervasive or destructive in influence, contending that partisan agreement is the historical trend in Congress and still frequent in the modern era, including on bills of political importance. Some studies have found approximately 80% of House bills passed in the modern era to have had support from both parties. =The public= ANES feeling thermometer responses 1980-2016, showing a rise in affective polarization Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate, but this is not unanimous. Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, party identification and voter turnout. It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government., and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil, which can alienate voters. More polarized candidates, especially when voters aren't aware of the increase, also tend to be less representative of the public's wishes. On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness. Polarized parties become more ideologically unified, furthering voter knowledge about their positions and increasing their standard to similarly-aligned voters. Affective polarization has risen in the US, with members of the public likely to say that supporters of the other major political party are hypocritical, closed-minded, and selfish. Based on survey results by the American National Election Study, affective polarization has increased significantly since 1980. This was determined by the differences of views an individual had of their political party and the views they had of the other party. Americans have also gotten increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of their child marrying someone of another political party. In 1960, 4-5% of Americans said they were uncomfortable with the idea. By 2010, a third of Democrats would be upset at this outcome, and half of all Republicans. =The media= As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have \\"reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public.\\" As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure. While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience, polarized environments make it easier for the media and interest groups to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions, generally healthy for democracy. =Judicial systems= Judicial systems can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges; In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s. More polarized parties have more aggressively blocked nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas. Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues that \\"senatorial intolerance for the opposing party‚Äôs nominees is itself a function of polarization.\\" Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts, longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges. Voting margins have also become much closer for filling vacancies on the Supreme Court. Justice Antonin Scalia was confirmed 98-0 in 1986; Ruth Bader Ginsberg was confirmed 96-3 in 1993. Samuel Alito was confirmed 58-42 in 2005, and Brett Kavanaugh was 50-48 in 2018. Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as \\"polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges.\\" It also influences the politics of senatorial advice and consent, giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch. Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility. Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters. =Foreign policy= Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on foreign policy and harm a nation's international standing; divisiveness on foreign affairs strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilize a nation's determination. Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the foreign policy of the United States\\". First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises. Second, elite opinion has a significant impact on the public's perception and understanding of foreign policy, a field where Americans have less prior knowledge to rely on.

After the Second World War, the Kunsthistorisches Institut was briefly relocated to Schleswig in 1945, where Sedlmaier was represented by during the summer semester. In the winter semester 1945/1946 the institute was moved back to Kiel. Sedlmaier, Lilli Martius and Arthur Haseloff held lectures and Sedlmaier made special efforts to rebuild the Kunsthalle and restore the collection. This made it possible to integrate works by Emil Nolde, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Ernst Barlach, among others, into the collection. From 1948 Sedlmaier concentrated on the planning and execution of the necessary building measures; from 1950 onwards, larger exhibitions could be shown again. In 1958 the Kunsthalle was reopened with the expanded collection. In the same year he was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit for his \\"services to art and art studies\\". In teaching and research, Sedlmaier was primarily concerned with questions of regional medieval art. Among his students were , who came to Kiel from Rostock in 1946 and habilitated under Sedlmaier in 1950, as well as Gerhard Wietek, Wolfgang Teuchert and Alfred Kamphausen. Sedlmaier became emeritus in 1958 and died in 1963 in Tegernsee at the age of 72.

She was a gender fluid individual who preferred feminine pronouns. Kewpie worked as a hairdresser in District Six and her salon became the center of the queer and drag community. She performed under the stage name of Capucine. Kewpie's large collection of photos is owned by the Gay and Lesbian Memory in Action (GALA) and documents queer life during apartheid.  Biography  Kewpie was born Eugene Fritz in District Six in 1942. She was one of six siblings, but only herself and her brother, Trevor and sister Ursula, lived to become adults. She started taking ballet lessons at the University of Cape Town when she was 14. She was offered the chance to dance overseas, but her father refused the offer, causing a rift in their relationship. Nevertheless, her father did eventually help Kewpie get a job as a hairdresser and even bought her salon for her. The salon became a place where the queer community could safely meet and perform drag shows, or \\"Moffie concerts.\\" Kewpie performed under the name Capucine. Kewpie saw her gender identity as fluid, though most often used feminine pronouns. The family of her partner, Brian Armino, considered Kewpie to be a woman and treated her as such. In the 1960s, Kewpie's family moved out of District Six. When there were forced removals of people in the district in 1968, Kewpie refused to move and moved in with friends. She later opened a new salon, Salon Kewpie, in Kensington. Later in life, her sister, Ursula, took Kewpie into her home. Kewpie had throat cancer and had her trachea removed. After that operation, Ursula helped Kewpie into a retirement home. Kewpie continued to cut hair in the home for the other residents. Kewpie died in Kensington in 2012. Her legacy lives on as a collection of around 700 photos that depict queer life during apartheid South Africa that are in the care of Gay and Lesbian Memory in Action (GALA). Kewpie had first given her well- documented and labeled pictures to GALA in 1999. In 2018, an exhibition of the photos in context with the history of her life opened at the District Six Museum.

Early life and education Growing up in Inglewood, California, McGee showed an early interest in science and animals. She completed an undergraduate degree in conservation biology at Howard University, where she was an Environmental Biology Scholar. Her summer undergraduate research involved studying Yarrow's spiny lizard in the Cave Creek Canyon of the Chiricahua Mountains. In 2018, McGee completed a Master's degree in the School of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Arizona, with a focus in wildlife conservation and management. Research career McGee is currently pursuing a PhD at the University of Arizona, where she studies the effects of stream drying on lizard communities in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona. She is an American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) IF/THEN Ambassador. McGee also studies how to use social media to bring more African American women into careers involving water and land management. Science outreach and communication In April 2019, Earyn McGee was part of a team of women who criticised Discovery's response to science through song. Their response was a lip-synched music video set to \\"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\\", and portrayed a diverse bunch of women doing science, demonstrating that science is for everyone.

Her research and science outreach efforts have also been featured in several podcasts, including the science and comedy podcast Ologies, with Alie Ward. In addition to Corina Newsome, McGee is also one of the co-organizers of Black Birders Week, a social media campaign aimed at celebrating Black naturalists, scholars, and birders. The initiative was a direct response to series of events including the racism faced by Black birder, Christian Cooper in Central Park and police brutality against Black Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. The hashtags created by the initiative, #BlackInNature and #BlackBirdersWeek, were used several thousand times. Black Birders Week garnered worldwide media coverage, including a feature in National Geographic, Scientific American, and Forbes.

He played fifteen first-class matches for Queensland between 1892-93 and 1899-00 and was the States first first-class captain and wicket- keeper. Cricket career As of the early 1890s Bradley was considered one of the best batsmen in Brisbane, characterized by patience, and a good wicket- keeper. He played for the Brisbane Graziers' Cricket Club and in December 1892 he was selected for a series between Graziers' and a Rockhampton XI. It was noted that Graziers' did not have a longstop in place during the series due to Bradley's skill as a wicket-keeper. Bradley captained Graziers' in the second match of the series. Queensland was granted first-class status in the 1892-93 season, and in March 1893 a match between two Queensland sides was played to determine who would be selected for the states inaugural first-class match. Bradley played in the match and took a catch, a stumping, and was observed to be one of the better batsmen. He was selected as wicket-keeper and captain of the first state side which played New South Wales in Brisbane in April 1893. He scored a duck and 13 in the game, but did take a stumping and a catch and captained Queensland to victory by 14 runs.Queensland v NSW 1-4 April 1893 In March 1894 he was selected as Queensland's wicket-keeper in their second game which was against NSW in Sydney, but not as captain, and took two stumpings and a catch,NSW v Queensland 24-28 March 1894 and in December 1894 he played for Queensland against the touring English Ashes team.Queensland v AE Stoddart's XI 7-10 December 1894 In February 1895 NSW returned to Brisbane and Bradley took one catch and scored 44 and 21,Queensland v NSW 9-12 February 1895 and he also played in a second tour match against the English team.Queensland v AE Stoddart's XI 15-19 February 1895 In December he continued his streak of representing Queensland in all its first-class games in a match against NSW in Sydney.NSW v Queensland 13-17 December 1895 In the 1896-97 season Bradley was selected in a Queensland side which toured New Zealand playing in five games from December 1896 to January 1897 and notably did not keep wicket for the first time in his first-class career.Queensland in New Zealand, 1896-97 at Cricinfo He returned to keeping in April 1897 in a game against NSW in Brisbane.Queensland v NSW 16-19 1897 In late 1897 a Brisbane electorate cricket competition was established and Bradley played for the Woolloongabba club in the new competition. In February 1898 Bradley played against another English touring team for a combined Queensland and Victoria XI in Brisbane in a game which was drawn by agreement without the Australians batting.Queensland & Victoria v AE Stoddart's XI 19-22 February 1898 In January 1899 he returned to first-class captaincy leading Queensland in a match against South Australia in Brisbane, which Queensland lost by an innings and 284 runs,Queensland v South Australia, 14-17 January 1899 and he played his last first-class match in November against NSW in Brisbane, keeping wicket but not captaining.Queensland v NSW 25-28 November 1899 See also * List of Queensland first-class cricketers ReferencesExternal links * Category:1867 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:Queensland cricketers Category:Queensland cricket captains Category:Cricketers from Brisbane ","title":"William Bradley (cricketer)"},{"id":"64175599","text":"The 1914 Maine Black Bears football team was an American football team that represented the University of Maine during the 1914 college football season.

Egerton's bills for the entertainment and hospitality survive.John Payne Collier, The Egerton Papers (Camden Society: London, 1840), pp. 340-357: Huntington Library HHL MS EL 122, 124-7.

Arras hooks for tapestries were supplied by Page of Uxbridge.John Payne Collier, The Egerton Papers (Camden Society: London, 1840), pp. 347-8. Several guests brought gifts of food, George More from Loseley gave a stag, 24 pigeons, and 4 swans, the Warden of the Fleet Prison gave 4 sugar loaves, and the Lord Mayor of London brought a barrel of sack and 6 herons. John Kederminster brought 18 boxes of sweetmeats and 36 fine cakes.John Payne Collier, The Egerton Papers (Camden Society: London, 1840), pp. 350-7. The Queen arrived at Harefield and near the house, sheltering under a tree from the rain, heard a dialogue between a Bailiff and Dairy Maid. At the entry to the house there was a chair for her, and a dialogue between Place and Time was presented, and the queen was given a diamond heart. Next she was given a gown of cloth of silver embroidered with rainbows, and a verse recalled the legend of St Swithun. Egerton provided the gown for ¬£340 and the Countess gave the sleeves and cords to attach them with ruby and pearl tags.Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth: 1596-1603, vol. 4 (Oxford, 2014), pp. 179-186: Heaton (2007), p. 236.

The Harefield Lottery  The concept of the Harefield lottery was the distribution of gifts by a mariner of a rich Carrack, a treasure ship, to the ladies of Cynthia, Queen of the Seas. A carrack from Lisbon had recently been brought to Plymouth. Participants in the Harefield lottery included, Mary Radcliffe, who was given a pair of bracelets, with this verse, \\"Lady your hands are fallen in a snare: For Cupid's manacles these bracelets are.\\" Frances, Lady Kildare was given a girdle, with the verses, \\"By fortune's girdle you may happy be: But they that are less happy are more free.\\" Dorothy Hastings was given a boldkin, a jewelled hair-pin, with the lines, \\"Even with this bodkin you may live unharmed: Your beauty with your virtues so well armed.\\" Audrey Walsingham had the prize of a cutwork stomacher in the lottery with the verses; \\"This stomacher is full of windows wrought: Yet none through them can look into your thought.\\" Elizabeth Brydges received a dozen points (clothing toggles) in the lottery with these verses; \\"You are in every point a lover true, And therefore fortune gives the points to you.\\" Cordell Anslowe drew a pin cushion, \\"To her that little cares what lot she wins: Chance gives a cushinet to stick pins.\\" At the end of the lottery a feather jewel worth ¬£600 was found and given to Elizabeth.Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth: 1596-1603, vol. 4 (Oxford, 2014), pp. 184-6, 188-193.

Sir George Savile wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury with a copy of the farewell speech, and mentioned the expensive jewels and the \\"gown of rainbows very rich embroidered.\\" The Jesuit Robert Persons was told that Alice, Countess of Derby asked the queen, who was in \\"her merriest vein\\" if Anne Stanley and her sister could serve in her privy chamber, or have consent to marry, which displeased the queen who commanded silence on such matters.Gabriel Heaton, 'Elizabethan Entertainments in Manuscript: The Harefield Festivities and the Dynamics of Exchange', p. 236-7. Anne married Grey Brydges, a cousin of Elizabeth Brydges in 1607.

Neotoma specializes in fossil data holdings at timescales covering the last several decades to the last several million years. Neotoma is organized and led by scientists and enhances data consistency through community curation by experts. Neotoma data are open to all and available to anyone with an internet connection. Neotoma data are used by scientists and teachers (especially paleoecologists, biogeographers, and archaeologists) to study the responses of species and ecosystems to past environmental change and growing human activity. Paleoclimatologists use Neotoma data to help reconstruct past climates. Sample research questions addressed include: 1) How sensitive are ecosystems to past climate change. 2) Why were rates of tree range expansion so fast after the end of the last ice age, given that tree seed dispersal distances are usually so short (Reid‚Äôs Paradox)? 3) Where and when did humans begin transforming ecosystems? 4) What were the causes and consequences of the widespread extinctions of large animals over the last 50,000 years? 5) Which ecosystems are characterized by abrupt change between alternate stable states and what triggers these abrupt changes? 6) How have freshwater resources and aquatic ecosystems been affected by human land use and activity over the last several decades?  Data types and data volume  The species and taxa stored in Neotoma represent a breadth of terrestrial and aquatic organisms: plants (pollen and larger fossils), mammals and other vertebrates, insects and other invertebrates, diatoms, ostracodes, and testate amoebae. Neotoma also stores the age estimates provided by radiometric dating (e.g. radiocarbon, lead-210) and the age estimates that are derived from statistical models of age as a function of depth in sediment column. The Neotoma data model is extensible to other types of paleoecological and paleoenvironmental variables. Data volume in Neotoma is growing rapidly, as are the data holdings in other paleontological and contemporary databases. As of May 2020, Neotoma held 7 million individual observations from over 38,700 datasets, 18,600 sites, 7,000 scientific papers, 6,000 authors, and 100 countries [1]. For comparison, On Nov 8, 2017, Neotoma held 3.8 million observations, from 17,275 datasets and 9,269 sites.  History  The intellectual foundations of Neotoma trace back to efforts by early paleontologists and paleoecologists in the first half of the 20th century to assemble many individual records into larger mapped syntheses. As von Post wrote, paleoecologists must ‚Äúthink horizontally, work vertically,‚Äù i.e. think across both time and space to understand the processes governing the ever-changing distribution of species, the associations among species, and the diversity of life. These efforts accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s, when a number of scientific teams began assembling databases of fossil distributions to study the spatial distributions of species over space and time and the effects of past environmental variations on these distributions. These efforts were powered by advances in computing capabilities and the growing availability of radiocarbon and other radiometric dates to provide a common time framework for all fossil occurrences. Much of this work focused on environmental and ecological changes accompanying the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary. These databases were used both by paleoclimatologists to draw inferences about past climates that could be used to test the paleoclimatic simulations of earth system models, and by paleoecologists interested in how past community dynamics were driven by these environmental changes. For example, Margaret Davis demonstrated tree species experienced large range shifts with the climate changes at the end of the last ice age and that species responded individualistically. As a result, many past communities were 'no analog,' i.e. their mixtures of species lack any close counterpart in modern communities. Some records and Constituent Databases in Neotoma extend deeper into the Cenozoic. In parallel, other research teams were gathering fossil records from high-resolution sediment archives spanning the last few decades to centuries to study the effects of human activities upon communities and ecosystems. Examples include the effects of acid rain on ecosystems in the 1980s, or the eutrophication of many lake ecosystems due to increasing nutrient runoff into lakes and streams. Many of these initial data- gathering efforts were led by individual pioneers (e.g. Margaret Davis, Tom Webb, Russ Graham, Bjorn Berglund, Jacques-Louis Beaulieu) or by small research teams. As these efforts have matured and as the amount of data has grown, the volume and complexity of paleoecological data is now beyond the capacity of any single individual expert to manage or curate. At the same time, many smaller paleontological and paleoecological databases have been unable to keep up with current advances in informatics, or have gone offline as funding lapsed or lead investigators retired or moved on. Hence, the fields of paleoecology and paleontology have developed data governance models based on community curation, in which data resources like Neotoma are managed by communities of scientists working together to curate and share their data. Neotoma follows a model of centralized informatics but distributed scientific governance, and is best viewed as a coalition of Constituent Databases that share a common set of database and software resources, while retaining separate rights to govern and curate the data in their Data Stewards' domains of expertise. For example, the European Pollen Database uses the Neotoma data model and software services, but is governed by its own board and community of expert data stewards. Neotoma works closely with the Paleobiology Database, which has a similar intellectual history, but has focused on the entire history of life, at timescales of millions to hundreds of millions of years. Together, Neotoma and the Paleobiology Database have helped launch the EarthLife Consortium, a non-profit umbrella organization to support the easy and free sharing of paleoecological and paleobiological data.  Data curation and governance  Neotoma employs a model of distributed data curation and governance. In this model, Neotoma data are curated and governed by a community of Data Stewards, organized into Constituent Databases. These Constituent Databases can be organized by region, time, or taxonomic group. For example, FAUNMAP is a Constituent Database in Neotoma that manages Quaternary fossil vertebrate records in North America, while MioMap primarily emphasizes Miocene vertebrate records. For pollen data, Constituent Databases are organized geographically and include the European Pollen Database, the North American Pollen Database, and the Latin American Pollen Database. Other major Constituent Databases include the Testate Amoebae Database, the International Ostracode Database, and the Diatom Paleoecology Data Cooperative. All data in Neotoma are uploaded and curated by Data Stewards associated with one or more Constituent Databases. This model of distributed community curation is essential to ensuring data quality and consistency. Neotoma is led by a Neotoma Leadership Council (NLC) comprising 14 elected councilors, of which 2 seats are reserved for early career scientists (Bylaws). Elections are held annually, with roughly one-third of the NLC elected each cycle. Neotoma is a recommended data facility for the Earth Sciences Division of the National Science Foundation, Past Global Changes, and the American Quaternary Association. Neotoma is a member of the ICSU World Data System and is registered with COPDESS registry for scientific data sources adhering to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) principles. Neotoma has been supported by multiple sources, including the National Science Foundation and the Belmont Forum.

About 20 were built. Design and development The Anzani-powered Touroplane B first prototype In 1928 Stanley Wallace set up a company to produce a three seat, high wing monoplane which he had designed and named the Touroplane. It was powered by an Anzani radial engine and as many as six of these may have been built. In 1929 Wallace Aircraft Co. marketed a development designated Touroplane B which had a Kinner K-5 radial. During 1929 Wallace Aircraft became a division of American Eagle, who called the type B the 330 Touroplane. The wing of the Touroplane was of blunted rectangular plan, built on twin spruce spars and fabric-covered. Its ailerons, which reached over half the span from the wingtips, had tube metal structures. The wings were mounted on the upper fuselage structure over the cabin and braced to the lower fuselage longerons by pairs of struts which converged slightly from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars. The wings could be folded, a task that took only a few minutes and reduced the width to . The Touroplane's Kinner engine was mounted with cylinders exposed for cooling. The fuselage was a welded, flat-sided, steel tube structure and was fabric-covered. The cabin placed pilot and co-pilot (or student or passenger) side by side under the leading edge of the wing, with a windscreen reaching forwards of it and with side windows. Dual controls were fitted. A third seat was placed centrally behind them, with its own windows. Access was via windowed doors under mid-chord, between the wing struts. The tube steel tail was conventional with a flight- adjustable tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage carrying rounded elevators. Its fin was straight-edged, with a rounded tip and was braced to the tailplane. The unbalanced rudder was full and rounded. The Touroplane had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with a track of . Its mainwheels, fitted with brakes, were on split axles from the central fuselage underside. Oleo strut legs and drag struts were mounted on the lower longerons. It had a long, sprung, tailskid. The original Touroplane first flew in 1928 though the date is not known. The prototype type B gained its ATC in 1929, then still Anzani- powered. Later, it was fitted with a Wright J-5 radial. After the prototype 13 were produced. Some were flown with other engines: two had Curtiss OX-5s and one a seven cylinder MacClatchie Panther radial. The latter was designated type C-31.

She married 28 January 1801 to John Crossley despite her parents objections. She had other suitors but John pressed his case and showed her the house she would have if they married. She did not like his family but it was agreed that this was not a problem. They had eight children. Her husband worked for a carpet manufacturer and in time he partnered with Robert Abbott and Francis Ellerton to form Abbott Crossley & Co. Her husband's contribution to the business was not capital but expertise. The business continued but her husband started a new business to do the spinning called Crossley, Travis and Crossley She was involved in finding their building. This business lasted for twenty years and each partner made ¬£1,200 when it was sold up. Martha operated a loom and would get up early to do so.

He flew his Bleriot XI airplane on August 10, 1911 at Sable Airstrip located in Aurora, Colorado at the junction of Sable Blvd. and the Union Pacific railroad tracks. Sable Airstrip was known for a favored location for early flyers and auto racers. During these young years Van Dersarl also built and flew a glider, which was built from a booklet ordered from a London company. It crashed on its first flight. =Career= Van Dersarl worked for Mountain Flyers Company as General Manager and Chief Pilot; plus giving aviation demonstrations, entertaining flights and exhibitions. They did stunts, flew with fireworks, did aerial photography and sold rides. In 1921, Van Dersarl founded Rocky Mountain Airlines. For seven years Van Dersarl ran The Denver Post Airshows and was the owner of the Vamp Aircraft Company. At one time, Van Dersarl and his brothers employed Charles A. Lindbergh in their Denver enterprise. In 1930, Van Dersarl owned and ran the first aircraft school in Denver for 3 years and also was the Chief of the Curtiss-Wright Denver branch. He built the first Mooney airplane. He constructed a total of about 46 airplanes. In later years, he worked on the Boeing B-29 program. Frank also owned and operated the Denver Union Airport, but the depression put an end to this enterprise. During WWII, he worked at the Denver Opportunity School and trained hundreds of workers and mechanics for the aviation industry. After the war, and until his retirement in 1967, he worked for the Colorado State Highway Department. =Hall of fame= Frank Van Dersarl was nominated and inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame in 1969, along with 9 other early Colorado aviators.

She serves as the United Nations special rapporteur on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.  Early life and education  Achiume was born in Zambia. When she was growing up, Achiume had an inspirational physics teacher, and first considered a career in physics and engineering. She attended the Atlantic College in Wales, where she first became interested in international law. Achiume earned her bachelor's degree at Yale University. She moved to the Yale Law School for her Juris Doctor, where she also earned a certificate in Development Studies. During her training she specialised in international migration and refugee rights. She was particularly interested in the humans rights abuses against Zimbabwean refugees who were seeking asylum in South Africa. After earned her doctoral degree, Achiume moved to South Africa, where she worked as a legal clerk for Dikgang Moseneke and Justice Yvonne Mokgoro in the Constitutional Court of South Africa. She also served as a lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand.  Research and career  Following her positions as a legal clerk, she was awarded a Bernstein International Human Rights fellowship to join the migrant rights project at Johannesburg's Lawyers for Human Rights. In 2014 Achiume joined the faculty at University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, Achiume leads the International Human Rights Clinic, a programme which teaches students international human rights through clinical projects. The projects led by Achiume include providing legal support for Indigenous peoples of the Americas, legal policies in Los Angeles and incarcerated women. As part of the programme, Achiume worked with Dignity and Power Now, an organisation in Los Angeles that looks to support incarcerated people and their families. She and her students looked at violations against incarcerated women of colour who suffered from mental illness. She demonstrated that these women were regularly denied physical or mental health support. She chaired the 2016 American Society of International Law annual meeting. In 2017 Achiume was appointed to the United Nations Human Rights Council as the UN special rapporteur on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. She was the first woman to hold such a position. In 2018 Achiume visited the United Kingdom to study the prevalence of race crimes and how they were being exacerbated by Brexit. Her verdict was that the Home Office hostile environment policy had ‚Äúentrenched racism‚Äù across the United Kingdom. She encouraged the Government of the United Kingdom to evaluate its policies on discrimination and to investigate the criminalisation of young Black men. Achiume identified that the anti-foreigner rhetoric that developed during the Leave.EU campaign was permeating society, and that austerity measures were disproportionately impacted communities of colour. In particular, she pointed out that ‚Äúhateful and stigmatising discourse had become 'normalised' ‚Äì even involving some high-ranking officials‚Äù. This visit was documented in her first report to the United Nations General Assembly, in which she concluded that ‚Äúethnonationalist populism‚Äù posed a considerable threat to racial equality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Achiume studied the rise in racism and xenophobia that spread alongside SARS-CoV-2. In particular, she said that people perceived to be of Chinese or East Asian descent were subject to xenophobic attacks. Achiume emphasised the need for education in combating racism, and that racial and xenophobic discrimination should become a more substantial part of education.

He was married to the grand-daughter of John and Abigail Adams.  Biography  In 1814, he married Caroline-Amelia Smith, a granddaughter of second U.S. President John Adams (and niece of sixth U.S. President John Quincy Adams). The family name was Americanized from the earlier Dutch spelling De Windt, and had roots in the Dutch Colonial Island of Saint Eustatius. Ten children out of eleven from their marriage survived to adulthood, including seven daughters, and their home, called Cedar Grove, which burned to the ground in 1857, was remembered as a center of culture in the Mid-Hudson Valley, through which traveled the Marquis de Lafayette, and celebrated artists, poets, and political leaders of the day.

In the 1850‚Äôs, sister Louisa married writer and art critic Clarence Cook and Emily Augusta married Frederick Clarke Withers, the architect. De Wint had substantial business enterprises and real estate holdings in Fishkill Landing and Newburgh but was especially interested in transportation and shipbuilding. In 1815, he built the Long Dock, in Fishkill Landing, Ruttenber, Edward, History of the Town of Newburgh, E.M. Ruttenber & Company, 1859 and contributed to the construction of the Newburgh spur of the Erie Railroad. He kept a shipyard on the Hudson river bank through which he oversaw his interests in freight through the production of sloops which were a quicker means of transportation between the towns along the Hudson and New York City than stage coach. J. P. De Wint had one constructed called the Caroline, after his daughter Caroline-Elizabeth, which made the trip in a record five hours.

Yet John Peter also donated land for the building of a Dutch Reformed Dutch (in keeping with his own family traditions) and a Methodist Church, as well as held community meetings at his home for a Unitarian congregation. He and his friend Warren Delano, the grandfather of FDR, helped build a Unitarian church on Liberty Street in Newburgh. http://uucrt.org/about-unitarian-universalism/history/ The fierceness of competition among steamboats on the Hudson preceded a deadly fire on the steamboat, the Henry Clay, on July 28th, 1852 while it was racing the Armenia.

The battle lasted roughly three years until December 2016, and ended with opposition fighter inside the city laying down their weapons and settling their status with the Syrian government. The battle typically consisted of small clashes and skirmishes between the two sides as well as shelling of each other's positions. On occasion, the Syrian army would carry out raids against the rebel-held areas, some having lead to significant civilian casualties. The Syrian Army imposed a siege against the rebel held areas first in late 2015, leading to a ceasefire between the two sides, and again in 2016, leading them to sign reconciliation agreements, ending fighting in the city.  Background  During March 2011, Sanamayn, like other towns and cities across Syria, became the site of protests against the government of Bashar al-Assad. On one occasion, up to 20 protesters were killed after setting a statue of Hafez al- Assad on fire. Late in the of the year, the first rebel groups in the city appeared, and more would follow in 2013.  History  In late 2012, the first rebel group in the town, the \\"Al-Sanamayn Revolutionaries Battalion\\" was formed. In early 2013, a rash of defections took place in the town, which was located on a strategic highway. Rebels would take over multiple areas of the city. The Syrian government remained in control of the military and security branches, main roads, heavily defended checkpoints such as the Qiyetah junction, and all military sites. On 10 April 2013, the Syrian Army launched an assault on the city targeting the southern areas. The Syrian armed targeted the city with artillery and rocket fire from barracks outside the city as they prepared to storm the city with heavy weapons. All roads leading in and out of the city were closed. The Syrian Army, accompanied by Hezbollah and pro- government militias, stormed the town and battled their way to the city center, forcing rebel forces to withdraw from the areas. 20 houses were destroyed and at least 45 people were killed in Sanamayn alone in what was described as a massacre by opposition activists. The town of Ghabagheb, north of Sanamayn, was also stormed. 16 rebels were killed in fighting in the two towns according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Some listed the death count in Sanamayn as high as 60. Despite the operation, rebels would continue to have a presence in Sanamayn. More groups would emerge in the town with light and medium weapons. Although the rebels were present in multiple areas of the city, the Syrian government once again remained in control of the important military checkpoints and sites, such as the base of the 9th Division, and the roads passing through the city. Two local councils would be formed by the opposition in rebel-held areas of the town. The first was announced in August 2013, and later joined the Union of Local Councils in Daraa Province. The second was announced in November, headed by Yassin al- Atmeh, and linked through connections with other Daraa councils to the Syrian Interim Government. Despite this, the rebel-held neighborhoods of Sanamayn were mainly reliant on the Syrian government for most public services, with the local councils only able to oversee the distributions of gifts and aid on certain occasions. Due to this, and to the fact that the number of opposition fighters in the city was very small, the rebels in Sanamayn failed to play a significant role in the Daraa Governorate campaign. Skirmishes and clashes would take place between the two sides, with rebels launching attacks on the military and security sites, leading on occasion to escalations such as shelling. In December 2015, four civilians were reportedly killed in the town due to shelling, although it could not be verified whether or not this came from the Syrian Army or rebels in the Southern Front targeting pro-government sites in the area. In December 2015, the Syrian Army imposed a blockade on the rebel-held neighborhoods of Sanamayn in response for the factions carrying out an attack on a car carrying an officer and several soldiers. Negotiations took place between the Syrian Army and rebel factions resulting in a ceasefire between the two sides. In December 2016, in response to the theft of government property by a corrupt leader of a rebel faction, the Syrian Army once again besieged the rebel-held neighborhoods of Sanamayn and pressed for a reconciliation agreement. Under the terms, the rebels were to confiscate their weapons and pledge not to carry out any attacks, as well as join the regular forces or the Russian-led 5th corps. The rebels were divided on whether to negotiate or respond militarily to the Syrian Army's actions. During the siege, rebel fire from the Southern Front targeted government-held areas, leading to civilian casualties. In the end, 510 people, including 150 rebels, accepted the reconciliation agreement, and Sanamayn came under full government control.

Nazi parties and other pro-Nazi organizations were formed in the Americas during the late inter-war period, in both the United States and South America. The members of these groups reflected the sympathies of some German-Americans and German Latin-Americans towards Nazi Germany, embracing the National Socialist spirit in Europe and establishing it within the Americas. Throughout the inter-war period and the outbreak of World War II, American Nazi parties engaged in activities such as sporting Nazi propaganda, storming newspapers, spreading Nazi-sympathetic materials and infiltrating other non-political organizations.neonazi alt-right The reaction to these parties was varied, ranging from widespread support to outright resistance, including the formation of the first anti-Nazi Jewish resistance organization in the United States. Nazism continued after the end of World War II in the Americas, particularly in the United States with the influx of refugees entering the country fleeing the war. Many Nazi-sympathisers entered the United States with the intention of continuing their support of Nazism even with the termination of the war. These attitudes have continued into the 21stcentury, with many supports of Neo-Nazism still existing within the United States and pro-Nazi groups, who have been known to attack and harass minorities.

Previously German-Americans had attempted to create pro-Nazi movements within the United States, often bearing swastikas and wearing uniforms, however these groups had little to do with Nazi Germany and lacked support from the wider German- American community in the United States.Jim Bredemus. \\"American Bund ‚Äì The Failure of American Nazism: The German-American Bund's Attempt to Create an American \\"Fifth Column\\"\\". TRACES.Retrieved May 2nd 2019. In May 1933, German immigrant and member of the German Nazi Party, Heinz Spankn√∂bel was given authority by Nazi Deputy F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess to form an official American Nazi Party, which would become the ‚ÄúFriends of New Germany‚Äù party, called the 'National Socialist German Workers' Party of the U.S.A.' by the NSDAP. The party had a strong presence in Chicago but was based in New York, having received support from the German consul in the city. Spankn√∂bel's organization was openly pro-Nazi, with one such engagement focused around storming the U.S. German language newspaper New Yorker Staats-Zeitung, demanding that the paper publish Nazi-sympathetic articles. Spankn√∂bel's leadership was short-lived however when he was deported in October 1933 after revelations that he had not registered as a foreign agent. Nazists attempted a coup d'√©tat in this country in 1933.The Plot to Overthrow FDRThe McCormack-Dickstein Committee (1934-1935) = World War II = Kuhn speaking at a Bund rally Flag of the German American Bund The Friends of New Germany dissolved in the 1930s into a new party known as the Amerika-Deutscher Volksbund (German American Bund), led by Fritz Kuhn. The party existed from 1935 until 1941, when America formally entered the Second World War. The Bund existed with the goal of a united National Socialist German America, and was antagonistic towards communists, proclaiming Communism as their main target, and also expressed anti-Semitic attitudes. The Bund were inspired by the Hitler Youth and created their own youth division, where members ‚Äútook German lessons, received instructions on how to salute the swastika, and learned to sing the ‚ÄúHorst Wessel Lied‚Äù and other Nazi songs.‚ÄùBell, Leland V. ‚ÄúThe Failure of Nazism in America: The German American Bund, 1936‚Äì1941.‚Äù Political Science Quarterly, vol. 85, no. 4, 1970, pp. 585‚Äì599. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2147597 The Bund continued to justify and glorify Hitler and his movements in Europe during the outbreak of World War 2; after Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Bund leaders released a statement demanding that America should stay neutral in the ensuing conflict, as well as expressing sympathy for Germany's war effort. The Bund reasoned that this support for the German war effort was not disloyal to the United States, as German Americans would ‚Äúcontinue to fight for a Gentile America free of all atheistic Jewish Marxist elements.‚Äù After many internal and leadership disputes, the Bund's executive committee agreed to disband the party, the decision coming the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbour. On December 11th, 1941, the United States formally declared war on the united Axis powers, and Bund headquarters were subsequently raided by Treasury Department agents. All records were seized and 76 Bund leaders were arrested and taken into custody. = After World War II = The OSI (Office of Special Investigations) estimated that around 10,000 Nazi war criminals entered the United States from Eastern Europe after the conclusion of World War II. This number was reached based on the fact that of the 40,000 immigrants who entered the United States, at least 2.5 per cent had been persecuted in the Nazi era.Schiessl, Christoph. Alleged Nazi Collaborators in the United States after World War II. Lanham: Lexington Books, 2016. Most Nazi collaborators entered the United States through the 1948 and 1950 DP Acts and the Refugee Relief Act of 1953. Supporters of the DP Acts showed only a slight awareness of the possibility of Nazi war criminals entering the United States through the Acts, with most concern being placed on disallowing known Communists from entering. This shift of focus was likely due to the pressures of the Cold War in the years after World War II, with the United States focusing on countering Soviet Communism more than Nazism. Eichmann photographed in or around 1942 During the 1950s, several investigations into suspected Nazi war criminals were conducted by the INS, but no official trials came from these investigations. The 1950s did not trigger a widespread discourse on the Holocaust or the possibility of Nazi collaborators living in the country, but this changed in the 1960s with the trial of Adolf Eichmann. In the 1960s, the United States began to focus on discovering Nazi war criminals remaining in the country. This came about due to several factors, including the 1962 trial of Adolf Eichmann, accusations of war criminals during Soviet war crimes trials in 1961-2 and a series of articles published by Charles R. Allen, detailing the presence of Nazi war criminals living in the United States. The 1970s saw increased public awareness of the Holocaust and Nazi war criminals, with many cases making headline news. The case of Hermine Braunsteiner-Ryan, the first Nazi war criminal to be extradited from the United States, received widespread coverage by the media, and the case triggered a drive by the INS to further locate Nazi collaborators.The New York Times at this period also took an interest in the effort, covering the search for collaborators. By the late 1970s, thousands of cases were addressed by the INS, and the U.S. government formed the OSI, dedicated specifically to locating Nazi war criminals in the United States. The United States since the rise of its Nazism has supported 35 Nazi terrorist and drug trafficking regimes.35 countries where the U.S. has supported fascists, drug lords and terrorists = 21st Century = South America  Inter-war period = In 1932, a national socialist party was officially created in Chile, called the National Socialist Movement of Chile (MNSCH) or ‚Äòel nacismo.‚Äô It was founded by Jorge Gonzalez von Marees alongside Carlos Keller Rueff, Juan de Dios Valenzuela and Gustavo Vargas Molinare. The members were referred to as Nacistas and the larger party was made up of a pyramid- structured hierarchy led by a Jefe, the greater party made up of various National Councils and the storm troops called the TNA.The party lacked a militant stand to racial matters, unlike European Nazism, as the matter of racial purity was not seen as having much importance in Chile and was deemed counterintiuitve to the national tradition. However, the MNSCH operated like many other fascist movements, with emphasis on military values, elitism, hierarchy, discipline, need for action, etc. The MNSCH also viewed the state as a form of self-preservation, and saw the need for a totalitarian, unified order, akin to European Nazism.Etchepare, Jaime Antonio, and Hamish I.

It is located about 8 miles northeast of Red River. Minerals had been discovered in the area in 1866, but settlement did not occur until several decades later. The town was established as a mining camp and named after Belle Dixon, the wife of a prospector who was one of the first investors in the area, on August 28, 1894. By December, La Belle boasted 80 buildings, including three saloons, a hotel, a restaurant, a mercantile store, and butcher, blacksmith, and feed shops. In March 1895, the population reached 600 inhabitants, and there was a demand for a schoolhouse, which was completed by July. The La Belle Cresset newspaper was published in the town. At its peak, three hotels operated in La Belle: the Southern Hotel, a four-story 80-room structure that was moved from Catskill; the Exchange Hotel, a 14-room structure operated by Mr. and Mrs. Nadock that later became known as the Nadock Hotel; and a third building. The Nadock Hotel served as an official stagecoach stop for newcomers. A post office was established in 1895, as was the jail, which was reported never to hold anyone. Prostitution flourished in La Belle during its brief existence. There was a small red-light district, and women often worked out of the second floor of saloons. In July 1895, the two Hagen brothers brought some girls in from Colorado Springs and opened a brothel. The notorious outlaw Black Jack Ketchum and his brother Sam were known to visit La Belle, as they had a nearby ranch. The Ketchum brothers attended dances at the Nadock Hotel, and their partner was frequently Annie Nadock, daughter of the proprietors. Black Jack Ketchum was captured and convicted of killing Sheriff Edward Farr after a train robbery in 1899. On April 26, 1901, he was hanged in Clayton. According to legend, Ketchum buried several thousand dollars of treasure near La Belle, which has never been discovered. La Belle declined precipitously in the early 1900s, as the gold mine was ultimately a disappointment as the ore was found to be low-grade. The post office closed in 1901. By 1910, the population had fallen to 10, and soon thereafter to zero. One of the only remaining buildings in La Belle is the La Belle Lodge, although this was constructed long after the town's heyday, in the 1950s. A fictionalized version of La Belle served as the setting of the 2017 Netflix series Godless. In the series, 88 men were killed in a mining accident, which was based on other mining disasters but never actually took place in La Belle. ReferencesExternal links *Keystone Mining District.

The book is a compilation of various annals recording the acts of the kings of Israel and Judah by a Deuteronomic compiler in the seventh century BCE, with a supplement added in the sixth century BCE. This chapter records the events during the reigns of Hoshea the last king of Israel, the capture of Samaria and the deportation of the northern kingdom population by the Assyrian. Text This chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language. It is divided into 41 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Structure This chapter can be divided into the following sections: * : Regnal account of Hoshea ben Elah of Israel and the fall of Samaria * : Theological analysis * : Interpretation of the situation in Samaria after the dispersion of Israel The skeletal narrative structure in this chapter is shaped by the actions of the king of Assyria, with the narrative followed by the commentary (twice): * direct attack on Israel (verses 1‚Äì23) **narrative (verses (1‚Äì6) **commentary (verses 7‚Äì23) *indirect attack on Israel (verses 24‚Äì41) **narrative (verses 24‚Äì28) **commentary (verses 29‚Äì41) Analysis This chapter provides a significant theological interpretation of Israel history connecting the long chronicles of the sin of the nation to the resulting divine punishment with the fall of the northern kingdom, as reflected by a 'dense concentration of Deuteronomistic language'. It also gives a glimpse to Judah's eventual fate, linking to other 'dense concentrations of Deuteronomistic judgment language' in ; ; . The northern prophets, Amos and Hosea, provide additional reflection on the reasons for the judgment. Hoshea, king of Israel (17:1‚Äì6) The regnal records of Hoshea, the last king of Israel, is evaluated less negatively than the previous kings of the northern kingdom, but his deeds are still 'evil in the sight of the Lord.' Hoshea's shift of allegiance from Assyria to Egypt has a disastrous consequence. Shalmaneser V, the king of Assyria, soon went up against Hoshea and laid siege on Samaria that last for three years, but Sargon II made the claim in his annals to have taken Samaria (ANET 284‚Äì285). =Verse 1= :In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah reigned hath Hoshea son of Elah in Samaria, over Israel -- nine years. YLT *\\"In the 12th year of Ahaz\\": According to McFall in the correction of Thiele's chronology,Thiele, Edwin R., The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , 9780825438257 this fell between September 724 BCE and September 723 BCE and during this period Hoshea \\"has reigned\\" in Samaria for 9 years, following \\"accession year method\\".. Quote: \\"12th year ‚Ä¶ is the terminus ad quem.\\" Most English versions translated the verb as \\"began to reign\\", treating the year as terminus a quo. *\\"Nine years\\": based on , according to Thiele's chronology, Hoshea began to reign between September 732 BCE and April 731 BCE ('in the 20th year of Jotham the son of Uzziah'), His ascension to the throne is recorded in the annals of Assyria (ANET 284. Quote: \\"They overthrew their king Pekah (Pa-qa-·∏•a) and I placed Hoshea (A-√∫-si- º) as king over them. I [Tiglath-Pileser III] received from them 10 talents of gold, 1,000 (?) talents of silver as their [tri]bute, and brought them to Assyria\\"). Following Thiele- McFall chronology, Hoshea died between April and September 723 BCE when Assyria captured Samaria. =Verse 3= :Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria. And Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. ESV *\\"Shalmaneser\\": is identified as Shalmaneser V. =Verse 4= Relief of Osorkon IV, from Tanis :And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. ESV *\\"So king of Egypt\\": identified mostly with \\"Osorkon IV\\" (reigned 730 ‚Äì 715/13 BCE), or other rulers including Pharaoh Shabaka of Egypt (710-696 BCE), Silhu (a north Arabian monarch; ≈†anda 214-16), Sibe (an Egyptian officer) and Pharaoh Tefnakhte (reigned 726-716 BCE) whose capital, Sais (s ºw), could be transliterated as \\"So\\" in Hebrew. =Verse 6= Relief of Sargon II, king of Assyria, who claimed to capture Samaria. :In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria, and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. ESV *\\"In the 9th year of Hoshea\\" according to Thiele-McFall chronology, Samaria was captured between April and September 723 BCE. *\\"The king of Assyria\\": although the siege was started by Shalmaneser V, his successor, Sargon II, claimed to have taken the city of Samaria and oversaw the deportation of northern Israel's people (ANET 284‚Äì285). The event and succession of Assyrian kings are recorded in one of the Babylonian Chronicles (ABC 1; \\"From Nabu-Nasir to ≈†ama≈°-≈°uma-ukin\\").ABC 1 (The Chronicle on the Reigns from Nab√ª-Nasir to ≈†ama≈°- ≈°uma-ukin). Livius.org. Accessed on June 4, 2020. English translation was adapted from A.K. Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles (1975) and Jean- Jacques Glassner, Mesopotamian Chronicles (Atlanta, 2004).

[i.29] The fifth year: ≈†almaneser went to his destiny in the month Teb√™tu. [i.30] For five years ≈†almaneser ruled Akkad and Assyria. [i.31] On the twelfth day of the month Teb√™tu, Sargon ascended the throne in Assyria.\\" The deportees were displaced decentrally to various location in the north-east Syria, effectively destroying the races, so the exiled northern Israelite people left few traces in history and tradition (becoming \\"Ten Lost Tribes\\" of Israel), unlike the Jews (the people of Judah) who were later moved en bloc to Babylon. Theological cause of the catastrophe (17:7‚Äì23) The exposition in this section consists of two parts: about Israel (verses 7‚Äì18) and involving Judah (verses 19‚Äì23). The first part is marked by the term \\"because\\" of verse 7 to the \\"therefore\\" in the beginning of verse 18: :A general indictment (verses 7‚Äì8) ::B specific crimes (verses (9‚Äì12) :::C prophetic warning unheeded (verses 13‚Äì14) :A' general indictment (verses 15‚Äì16a) ::B' specific crimes (verses 16b‚Äì17) :::C' result (verse 18) In the second part, the idolatry in kingdom of Judah is coordinated with that in the northern kingdom (verse 19; cf. verse 13), although the narrator at this point only hints the demise of Judah (as the punishment for its sins).  The immigrants from the east and their cults (17:24‚Äì41) Deportation of the Northern Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrian Empire. Following the principle of destroying races in the conquered territory, the Assyrians not only displaced the Israelites from their land, but also deported people from other lands into Israel. The places listed in verses 24, 29‚Äì41 are partly in Mesopotamia and partly in Syria.. This mixing of ethnicity would avoid the development of large-scale resistance and 'paralyse the regions using the tension between people' of different origins. The Deuteronomistic narrative focuses on the religious impacts of this policy, that 'the religion (gods and ritual traditions) in the province of Samaria 'became mixed'. It is noted that the worship of YHWH still exists, but 'united syncrestistically' with other religions (verses 32-34, 41), as explained using the episode recorded in verses 25-28.

Etymology  The name derives from the Neapolitan fiscella, which indicates the perforated basket in the shape of a truncated cone in which the cheese is transported and sold. The fiscella is traditionally made with braided reeds or wicker. The term fuscella indicates another cheesemaking tool commonly used in the production of ricotta which is made with food-grade plastic. It has a truncated cone shape and is perforated with small lines.  Characteristics  Ricotta di fuscella has a truncated pyramidal shape, with each cheese weighing under 4.4 lbs (2 kg). It has a porcelain white color, is crustless, and has a soft consistency with a delicate, sweet flavor.  Production process  The milk, which can be either raw or pasteurized, is filtered and refrigerated. It then is salted and brought to 183.2-185¬∞ F (84-85¬∞ C) and acidified. After around 30 minutes, while maintaining the temperature in the aforementioned range, the coagulated mass is separated and placed in perforated baskets (fuscelle) and preserved in ice for ten days. Organic acids and chemical pH correctors are not used. In the final step, the ricotta is covered in a protective wrapper and is preserved and sold without preserving liquid.  Production zones The production of this cheese occurs throughout the entire province of Naples, and it is consolidated in the municipality of Sant'Anastasia, historically known for its thriving goat raising operations, whose milk guarantees production in the entire region.  Uses  Ricotta di fuscella is eaten alone or used in the preparation of many traditional dishes of Campania, from stuffed pastas to desserts such as pastiera.

Dadisho flourished in the late 7th century.: \\"second half of the 7th century\\"; : \\"fl. 670\\"; : \\"died about 690\\". Originally from Beth Qatraye (eastern Arabia), he became attached first to the unidentified monastery of Rab-kennƒÅrƒì then later to those of Rabban Shabur (near Shushtar in Khuzestan) and the Blessed Apostles. Nothing else about his life is known. Giuseppe Simone Assemani identified him with Dadisho of Mount Izla, who lived a century earlier. Addai Scher, however, demonstrated that there were two distinct individuals. He wrote extensively in Syriac.For lists of editions of his works, see and . All of his writings are concerned with shelya (stillness). Among his surviving works are: *Treatise on Solitude, also called the Retreat of the Seven Weeks or the Seven Weeks of Solitude, which describes how a monk should retreat into complete solitude and prayer for seven weeks at a time *Letter to Mar Abkosh on Hesychia, also called On Stillness *Commentary on Abba Isaiah, which is a commentary on the Syriac version of the Asceticon of Isaiah of Scetis and describes shelya as the condition the soul must meet to reach God. All surviving manuscripts break off after the fifteenth discourse of Isaiah (out of twenty-six), but there are quotations from the rest of the work in a fragmentary commentary on Isaiah that was apparently a reworking of Dadisho's. *Commentary on the Paradise of the Fathers, which is a commentary on the Paradise of the Fathers of Enanisho in the form of a series of questions posed by some monks to their superior concerning the issues raised by the sayings of the Egyptian Fathers collected by Enanisho He also wrote a few short work on similar ascetic themes., who quotes  øAbdisho ø bar Brikha's 14th-century catalogue of Nestorian writers: \\"he wrote a commentary on the Paradise of the Occidentals; he elucidated Abba Isaiah; he wrote a book on the way of life, treatises on the sanctification of the cell, consolatory dirges; he also wrote letters and inquiries on stillness in the body and soul.\\" Both of his commentaries were translated into Arabic and Sogdian. Although only fragments of the latter survive, the Arabic version survives both complete and abridged and in both Arabic script and Garshuni. The Commentary on the Paradise was also translated from Arabic into Ethiopic. The Arabic version of the Abba Isaiah commentary describes Dadisho as a disciple of Isaac of Nineveh. These translations assured him a wide diffusion among the Oriental Orthodox. Dadisho is the earliest writer to credit an Egyptian monk, Mar Awgin (a figure he may have invented), with the introduction of monasticism to Mesopotamia in the 4th century.

Historical background Such major battles during the Lithuanian Crusade were rare. As reported by Russian historian Aleksiy Khoteev in On the Hundred Years' War of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, military operations were generally confined to raids aimed at causing economic damage to the enemy as much as possible through the devastation of lands, seizure of property and taking local residents captive, as repeatedly attested and thoroughly reported in the Order's chronicles such as Chronicon terrae Prussiae (Latin for The Chronicle of the Prussian Land) by Peter of Dusburg, the eponymous The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin and Chronica nova Prutenica (Latin for New Prussian Chronicle) by Wigand of Marburg. Campaign and battle On 3 April 1311, at the head of a force of 4,000 men (according to The Chronicle of the Prussian Land by Peter of Dusburg and The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin) Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytenis invaded Warmia, which was inhabited by baptized Warmians and German immigrants. His army totally looted and destroyed the lands of Warmia, killing most of local Christians and captured 1,200 people (according to Peter of Dusburg) or 1,300 (according to Nikolaus von JeroschinThe Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310). Vytenis decided to return through the lands of Bartia.The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310 On 6 April, having reached the area near Woklauken, the Lithuanian army set up a camp on the hill, encircling it with abatis.The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310 In the meantime, the Teutonic Order gathered an army under the command of Grosskomtur Heinrich von Pl√∂tzkeThe Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310 and sent it to chase Vytenis.The Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310 The army consisted of Teutonic Knights numbering 80 according to Nikolaus von JeroschinThe Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310 or 150 according to Peter of Dusburg.Chronicon terrae Prussiae by Peter of Dusburg, Book 3, 310 Reporting on the number of the Teutonic Knights themselves, however, neither Peter of Dusburg nor Nikolaus von Jeroschin provides any data on the number of Sariantbrothers, i.e. not knighted members of the Order, who used to make up the bulk of the Order‚Äôs army at the time (including lances fournies).

Besides, according to Konrad Gesselen (who translated into Low German the aforementined Chronica nova Prutenica), a part of the army was composed of Prussian militiamen. However, none of these authors provides the number of the not knighted crusaders or the Prussian militiamen. The vanguard led by Komtur of Christburg G√ºnther von ArnsteinThe Chronicle of Prussia by Nikolaus von Jeroschin, Lines 23,470‚Äì897; III, 310 was dispatched ahead.

An additional rocky transiting planet candidate KOI-456.04, located in the habitable zone, was detected in 2020, and more non-transiting planets are suspected due to residuals in the solution for the transit timing variations. From what researchers can tell, KOI-456.04 looks to be less than twice the size of Earth and is apparently orbiting Kepler-160 at about the same distance from Earth to the sun (one complete orbit is 378 days).

Axo-axonic synapses have been found and described more recently than the other more familiar types of synapses, such as axo-dendritic synapses and axo-somatic synapses. The spatio- temporal properties of neurons get altered by the type of synapse formed between neurons. Unlike the other types, the axo-axonic synapse does not contribute towards triggering an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Instead, it affects the probability of neurotransmitter release in the response to any action potential passing through the axon of the postsynaptic neuron. Thus, axo-axonic synapses appear to be very important for the brain in achieving a specialized neural computation. Axo-axonic synapses are found throughout the central nervous system, including in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum in mammals; in the neuro-muscular junctions in crustaceans; and in the visual circuitry in dipterans. Axo-axonic synapses can induce either inhibitory or excitatory effects in the postsynaptic neuron. A classic example of the role of axo-axonic synapses is causing inhibitory effects on motoneurons in the spinal-somatic reflex arc. This phenomenon is known as presynaptic-inhibition.  Background  Illustration of the axo- axonic synapse formed between the terminal of presynaptic neuron and the axon of postsynaptic neuron. Complex interconnections of neurons form neural networks, which are responsible for various types of computation in the brain. Neurons receive inputs mainly through dendrites, which play a role in spatio- temporal computation, leading to the firing of an action potential which subsequently travels to synaptic terminals passing through axons. Based on their locations, synapses can be classified into various kinds, such as axo- dendritic synapse, axo-somatic synapse, and axo-axonal synapse. The prefix here indicates the part of the presynaptic neuron (i.e., ‚Äòaxo-‚Äô for axons), and the suffix represents the location where the synapse is formed on the postsynaptic neuron (i.e., ‚Äò-dendritic‚Äô for dendrites, ‚Äò-somatic‚Äô for cell body and ‚Äò-axonic‚Äô for synapses on axons). Synapse location will govern the role of that synapse in a network of neurons. In axo-dendritic synapses, the presynaptic activity will affect the spatio-temporal computation in postsynaptic neurons by altering electrical potential in the dendritic branch. Whereas the axo-somatic synapse will affect the probability of firing an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron by causing inhibitory or excitatory effects directly at the cell body. Whereas the other types of synapses modulate postsynaptic neural activity, the axo-axonic synapses show subtle effects on the network-level neural information transfer. In such synapses, the activity in presynaptic neurons will not change the membrane potential (i.e., depolarize or hyperpolarize) of the cell body of postsynaptic neurons because presynaptic neurons project directly on the axons of the postsynaptic neurons. Thus, the axo-axonic synapse will mainly affect the probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release in response to an action potential firing in the postsynaptic neuron. Unlike other kinds of synapses, the axo-axonic synapse manipulates the effects of a postsynaptic neuron‚Äôs firing on the neurons further downstream in the network. Due to the mechanism of how axo-axonic synapses work, most of these synapses are inhibitory, and yet a few show excitatory effects in postsynaptic neurons.  History  The first direct evidence of the existence of axo-axonic synapses was provided by E. G. Gray in 1962. Gray produced electron microscopy photographs of axo- axonic synapses formed on the terminals of muscle afferents involved in the spinal somatic reflex arc in a cat‚Äôs spinal cord slices. Later, Gray coined the term ‚Äòaxo-axonic‚Äô after getting photographic confirmation from as many as twelve axo-axonic synapses. Within the next two years, scientists found axo- axonic synapses in various other places in the nervous system in different animals, such as in the retina of cats and pigeons, in the lateral geniculate nucleus of monkeys, in the olfactory bulb of mice, and in various lobes in the octopus brain. This further confirmed the existence of axo-axonic synapses in the brain across animal phyla. Prior to the discovery of axo-axonic synapses, physiologists predicted the possibility of such mechanisms as early as in year 1935, following their observations of electrophysiological recordings and quantal analysis of brain segments. They had observed inhibitory responses in postsynaptic motoneurons in the slice preparation of the monosynaptic reflex arc. During simultaneous recordings from presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, the physiologists could not make sense of the infrequent inhibition observed in the postsynaptic neuron, with no membrane potential changes in the presynaptic neuron. At that time, this phenomenon was known as ‚Äúpresynaptic inhibitory action‚Äù, the term proposed by Karl Frank in 1959 and later well summarized by John Eccles in his book. After Gray‚Äôs finding of the axo-axonic synapse in 1962, scientists confirmed that this phenomenon was in fact due to the axo-axonic synapse present in the reflex arc. More recently, in 2006 researchers discovered the first evidence of excitatory effects caused by an axo-axonic synapse. They found that GABAergic neurons project onto the axons of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex to form axo-axonic synapse and elicit excitatory effects in cortical microcircuits.  Function  Below are the brain locations where axo-axonic synapses are found in different animals. = Cerebellar cortex = Drawing of the cerebellar cortex, showing axo-axonic synapses (green) formed by Basket cell projections (pink) onto Purkinje cells (blue) at the axon hillock. The axo-axonic synapse in the cerebellar cortex originally appeared in one of the drawings of Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in his book published in 1909. Later using electron microscopy, it was confirmed that the basket cell axon projects on the axon hillock of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex in cats and other mammals, forming axo-axonic synapses. The first electrophysiological characterization of an axo-axonic synapse formed on Purkinje cells was done in 1963, where the presynaptic basket cell axons were found to inhibit the terminal output of postsynaptic Purkinje cells through the axo-axonic synapse. Network-level study revealed that the granule cells (a.k.a. the parallel fibers) which activated Purkinje cells, also activated the basket cells which subsequently inhibited the effect of Purkinje cells on the downstream network. = Cerebral cortex = Axo-axonic synapses are found In the visual cortex (in V1 and V2) in mammals, and have been well studied in cats, rats and primates such as monkeys. The synapse is formed on the initial segments of the axons of pyramidal cells in several layers in the visual cortex. The projecting neurons for these synapses come from various parts of the central nervous system and neocortex. Similarly, axo-axonic synapses are found in the motor cortex, in the subiculum and in the piriform cortex. In the striate cortex, as the Golgi‚Äôs method and electron microscopy revealed, as many as five axo-axonic synapses are formed onto a single pyramidal cell. In the cerebral cortex, inhibitory axo-axonic synapses may play a widespread role in network level activity by enabling synchronized firing of pyramidal cells, essentially by modulating the threshold for output of these cells. These synapses are also found on the initial segments of axons in pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex, and in the primary olfactory cortex which are found to be the inhibitory kind. Studying the locations of axo-axonic synapses in the primary olfactory cortex, researchers have suggested that axo-axonic synapses may play a critical role in synchronizing oscillations in the piriform cortex (in the olfactory cortex), which aids olfaction. The axo- axonic synapses are also found in the hippocampus. These synapses are found to be formed mainly on principal cells in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale and rarely on stratum radiatum; they commonly receive projections from GABAergic local interneurons. The horizontal interneurons show a laminar distribution of dendrites and are involved in axo-axonic synapses in the hippocampus, which get direct synaptic inputs from CA1 pyramidal cells. Thus, in general, these studies indicate that axo-axonic synapses can provide a basic mechanism of information processing in the cerebral cortex. = Basal ganglia = Microscopy studies in the striatum previously suggested rare occurrence of axo-axonic synapses in individual sections. Extrapolations from the topological data suggest much higher counts of such synapses in the striatum where the therapeutic role of the axo-axonic synapses in treating schizophrenia has been postulated previously. In this study, authors examined 4,811 synapses in rat striatum sections, and 15 of them were found to be the axo-axonic synapses. These axo-axonic synapses are formed by dopaminergic inhibitory interneurons (on the presynaptic side) projecting onto the axons of glutamatergic cortico-striatal fibers in the rat striatum. = Brainstem = Axo-axonic synapses are found in the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem. Electron microscopy studies on the kitten brainstem quantified synaptogenesis of axo-axonic synapses in the spinal trigeminal nucleus at different development ages of the brain. Authors identified the synapses by counting vesicles released in the synaptic cleft, which can be observed in the micrographs. Axo-axonic contacts are shown to consistently increase throughout the development period, starting from the age of 3 hours to the age of 27 days in kittens. The highest rate of synaptogenesis is during the first 3 to 6 days, at the end of which, the kitten‚Äôs spinal trigeminal nucleus will have nearly half of the axo-axonic synapses present in adult cats. Later, between 16 to 27 days of age, there is another surge of axo-axonic synaptogenesis. Axo-axonic synapses are also observed in the solitary nucleus (also known as nucleus of the solitary tract) uniquely in the commissural portion in the neuroanatomical studies, which used 5-hydroxydopamine to label axo-axonic synapses. Axo-axonic synapses are formed on baroreceptor terminals by the presynaptic adrenergic fibers, and are proposed to play a role in baroreflex. = Spinal Cord = Axo-axonic synapses are found in the mammalian spinal reflex arc and in Substantia gelatinosa of Rolando (SGR). In the spinal cord, axo-axonic synapses are formed on the terminals of sensory neurons with presynaptic inhibitory interneurons. These synapses are first studied using intracellular recordings from the spinal motoneurons in cats, and have been shown to cause presynaptic inhibition. This seems to be a common mechanism in spinal cords, in which GABAergic interneurons inhibit presynaptic activity in sensory neurons and eventually control activity in motor neurons enabling selective control of muscles. In efforts to quantify the occurrence of axo- axonic synapses in the SGR region in rats, 54 such synapses were found among the total 6,045 synapses examined. These 54 axo-axonic synapses were shown to have either agranular vesicles or large granular vesicles. = Vestibular system = Axo-axonic synapses are found in the lateral vestibular nucleus in rats. Axo-axonic synapses are formed from the small axons of interneurons onto the axon terminals of large axons, which are upstream to the main dendritic stem. Interestingly, the authors claimed that axo-axonic synapses, which are abundant in rats, are absent in the lateral vestibular nucleus in cats. They note that the types of axon terminals identified and described in cats are all found in rats, but the reverse is not true because the axons forming the axo- axonic synapses are missing in cats. These synapses are proposed to enable complex neural computation for the vestibular reflex in rats. = Hindbrain = Axo-axonic synapses are found in the mauthner cells in goldfish. The axon hillock and initial axon segments of mauthner cells receive terminals from extremely fine unmyelinated fibers, which cover the axon hillock with helical projections. These helical projections around mauthner cells are also known as the axon cap. The difference between the axo-axonic synapses and other synapses on mauthner cells is that synapses on dendrites and soma receive myelinated fibers, while axons receive unmyelinated fibers. Mauthner cells are big neurons which are involved in fast escape reflexes in fish. Thus, these axo-axonic synapses could selectively disable the escape network by controlling the effect of mauthner cells on the neural network further downstream. Studying the morphological variation of the axo-axonic synapses at the axon hillock in mauthner cells suggests that, evolutionarily, these synapses are more recent than the mauthner cells. Response to the startle can be mapped phylogenetically, which confirms that basal actinopterygian fish, with little to no axo-axonic synapses on mauthner cells, show worse escape response than fish with axo-axonic synapses. = Neuromuscular junction = Inhibitory axo-axonic synapses are found in the crustacean neuromuscular junctions and have been widely studied in Crayfish. Axo-axonic synapses are formed on the excitatory axons as a postsynaptic neuron by the motor neurons from the presynaptic side. Motor neurons, which is the common inhibitor in crab limb closers and limb accessory flexors, form axo-axonic synapses in addition to the neuromuscular junction with the muscles in crayfish. These synapses were first observed in 1967, when they were found to cause presynaptic inhibition in leg muscles of crayfish and crabs. Subsequent studies found that axo-axonic synapses showed varying numbers of occurrence based on the location of the leg muscles from the nervous system. For instance, proximal regions have thrice as many axo-axonic synapses than the central regions. These synapses are proposed to function by limiting neurotransmitter release for controlled leg movements.  Clinical Significance  An example of the physiological role of axo-axonic synapses, which are formed by GABAergic inhibitory interneurons to the axons of granule cells, is in eliciting spontaneous seizures, which is a key symptom of Intractable Epilepsy. The presynaptic inhibitory interneurons, which can be labeled by cholecystokinin and GAT-1, are found to modulate the granule cells‚Äôs spike output. The same cells subsequently project excitatory mossy fibers to pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region. One of the two leading theories for the pathoetiology of schizophrenia is the glutamate theory. Glutamate is a well studied neurotransmitter for its role in learning and memory, and also in the brain development during prenatal and childhood. Studies of rat striatum found inhibitory axo-axonic synapses formed on the glutamatergic cortico-striatal fibers. They proposed that these axo-axonic synapses in the striatum could be responsible for inhibiting the glutamatergic neurons. Additionally, these dopaminergic synapses are also proposed to cause hyperdopaminergic activity and become neurotoxic for the postsynaptic glutamatergic neurons. This mechanism is proposed to be a possible mechanism for glutamate dysfunction in observed schizophrenia.  Development  A study on the spinal cord in mice suggests that the sensory Ig/Caspr4 complex is involved in the formation of axo-axonic synapses on proprioceptive afferents. These synapses are formed through projection of GABAergic interneurons on sensory neurons, which is upstream to the motor neurons. In the axo-axonic synapse, expressing NB2 (Contactin5)/Caspr4 coreceptor complex in postsynaptic neurons along with expressing NrCAM/CHL1 in presynaptic interneurons results in the increased numbers of such synapses forming in the spinal cord. Also, knocking out NB2 from the sensory neurons reduced the number of axo-axonic synapses from GABAergic interneurons, which suggests the necessity and the role of NB2 in synaptogenesis of axo-axonic type of synapses.

A prominent member of the Peruvian Aprista Party, he was signaled in his youth as one of V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre's main disciples, alongside future President of Peru, Alan Garc√≠a. In his political career, he served in the Constituent Assembly of 1978‚Äì1979, which drafted the Constitution of 1979, in the now- abolished Chamber of Deputies, and finally as Peruvian Ambassador to Italy, appointed in Alan Garc√≠a's second presidency. Currently, Roca serves as Director of the V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre House Museum. In the party, he served as National Secretary of International Affairs from 2010 to 2017. Early life and education Born in Downtown Lima on 20 March 1946, he registered at 16 years of age in the Peruvian Aprista Party after witnessing V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre's \\"Veto Speech\\", in which the founder of the APRA denounced the military veto against his presidential nomination's first place in the election turnout in 1962. After finishing his high school studies in the Bre√±a District, he enrolled in the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, finishing the humanities curriculum in 1963. He ultimately dropped out and travelled to Italy to finish this undergraduate degree at the University of Turin, graduating in 1969 with a bachelor's degree in political science. Career Upon the culmination of his degree, he went back to Peru to start a career in the Peruvian Aprista Party's youth wing. In 1970, he was selected among the most talented young members of the party to the National Bureau of Conjunctions, under V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre's leadership. Alongside future party leader Alan Garc√≠a and V√≠ctor Polay, he was considered a rising star in the party, and even as a long-term successor to Haya. In 1978, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly. In his task of drafting a new Constitution, he personally assisted Haya, who served as President of the Assembly. Upon Haya's death in August 1979, Roca took a prominent role in his wake, propelling him as one of the party's future congressional nominees for the 1980 election. In 1980, he was overwhelmingly elected to the lower house of the newly inaugurated Peruvian Congress, representing the Lima constituency with the Peruvian Aprista Party. That same year, he was appointed by the party's national convention as International Affairs Secretary. His rising figure in the party leadership would ultimately fade away with Alan Garc√≠a's election as Secretary-General in 1982. Reelected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1985, he was not part Alan Garc√≠a's cabinet, solely serving in his position as congressman. He was reelected for a third term in 1990, although his term was interrupted due to Alberto Fujimori's self-coup, which dissolved Congress. Roca would try to regain his seat in Congress in 1995, but was not elected, obtaining a few share of votes as the Peruvian Aprista Party only gained 8 seats. He was selected as the party's nominee for Mayor of Lima for the 1998 election, placing third with 5% of the popular vote. In 2001 and 2006, Roca unsuccessfully ran for Congress. In Alan Garc√≠a second administration, he was appointed Peruvian Ambassador to Italy, serving from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, Roca was selected as the party's nominee for Mayor of Lima for a second time, but withdrew before the election. Since 2010, he has served as Director of the V√≠ctor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre House Museum. From 2010 to 2017, he served once again as International Affairs Secretary. He remains a loyal member of the party. His opinion is usually sought by the media relating to the Peruvian Aprista Party's history and its renovation. He is critical of the party's current internal crisis since before Alan Garc√≠a's suicide. He unsuccessfully ran for the party's leadership election in October 2019, losing to C√©sar Trelles Lara. His followers accused the electoral tribunal of fraud in favor of Trelles, although Roca remained hopeful of the party's recovery in popularity. Following the Peruvian Aprista Party's failure to gain congressional seats in the 2020 parliamentary snap election, he criticized the controversial congressional nominations selected by the party's executive committee, blaming the poor results on the current leadership.

Personal life  Hodgson married Eva Sara Fornady in 1960, and they have two children, David A. Hodgson and Jennifer H. Anton. They continue to live in Nashville, Tennessee, following retirement, and spend summers in Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania. Hodgson is ordained in the Presbyterian Church (USA).  Research and views  Following hints from George Eliot, Hodgson believes that theology is a kind of fiction that offers imaginative variations on what is real. But first it must attend to the real, with all the detailed descriptions of the novelist, all the nuances in human attitudes, feelings, and actions, all the ambiguities and tragic failures that characterize human communities. Many theologians and preachers today avoid the real: they offer escapes and fantasies rather than honest engagement with the material world and human culture. The tendency toward supernaturalism and the miraculous is the clearest evidence of this escape, and the interest in the miraculous has not diminished over the ages on the part of many religious people. The problem is that many more people do not find such a worldview persuasive any longer, and they have withdrawn from engagement with religion. They are living in a secular, scientific world, and their values are determined accordingly. These are the values of quantitative measurement, pleasure, and altruism. This is the reality most people live in today, but theology and the church are disconnected from it and offer an alternative world that in many ways is less real. Life in fact is hard, a long and often discouraging struggle with relentless forces‚Äîthe forces of nature; of the human body with its vulnerability to illness, disease, and aging; of the human psyche with its emotions, aggressions, and depressions. The belief that God intervenes in history to save people in miraculous ways is not persuasive, according to Hodgson. If God can do this in some instances (those that serve our interests), why should God not always intervene to prevent the vast suffering that is everywhere present, to cancel the great tragedies of history, to protect the environment from the damage that civilization is inflicting on it? God is not a magician who controls what goes on in the world, although many people seem to think of God that way. Christ is not a divine savior who dies a substitutionary death and frees us from responsibility for our deeds. Na√Øve ideas about God and Christ account for the irrelevance of religion in the world. Theology does not seem much interested in the hard task of reconstructing conceptions of God and Christ in ways that take into account the realities of life as we actually experience them. These realities offer resources for theology if it is open to receiving them: the emancipatory struggles of oppressed peoples, the heightened consciousness of feminism and gender differences, the pluralism of religious and cultural traditions, the participation of humans in a vast ecological system that can be thrown out of balance all too easily. Theology offers imaginative variations on these realities. This is where ideality comes into play. Following Hegel, Hodgson argues that God is the supreme ideality: pure spirit and absolute rationality . God is the source of creative possibility, imagination, novelty, and purpose. God is not a being among beings, a material entity or natural force. God lacks physicality and cannot be measured, weighed, or utilized like a material object. God is an idea‚Äîcertainly a human idea, but also an objectively self-actualizing and self-sustaining idea. Without ideality, the universe would be an immense, soulless interaction of meaningless natural forces. God‚Äôs ideality includes values that we associate with goodness, love, freedom, trustworthiness, community, superabundance. This ideality goes forth from itself and creates an other than itself, the material and spiritual world, which has its own powers and autonomies that often go awry and conflict with each other, producing tragic and destructive consequences. What we call ‚Äúspirit‚Äù is the ideal embodied in the material and human world. God is absolute spirit, which means that God overreaches and embraces the world of finite spirits within godself, related to all that is not-God. People do not know the ideal in and for itself except in a purely abstract, rational sense. The advance from Kant to Hegel in the history of philosophy is the advance from abstract rationality to concrete historicality. Hegel says that history is constructed from the interweaving of the divine idea and human passions, and that history is the progress of the consciousness of freedom. The idea provides values and direction; the passions provide energy and movement. History has meaning, but also struggle and conflict. Just how God as the absolute idea provides values and direction to history is one of the most difficult theological questions‚Äîthe question of how God acts efficaciously in history without violating historical processes. Hegel and Whitehead point to the same answer, namely, that the divine values and guidance function as a lure, a pattern, an invitation calling for a human response. Without the response, without the determination to shape history in accord with the divine pattern, there is no efficacious presence of God in history. Very often human beings confuse their own purposes with the ideal purpose. They need a concrete paradigm, and Christians believe that Jesus Christ is this paradigm. Hodgson‚Äôs view is that Jesus is a human being who is filled by the Spirit of God and becomes an agent of God‚Äôs work in the world through his teaching and example, and his death on a cross. He is not the only such agent. Other religions and cultures have their own paradigmatic agents, such as Moses, Muhammad, Brahman, the Buddha, and among these agents there seems to be a broad concurrence about good and evil, which is not to deny their very real differences. History has produced other great figures who provide moral and intellectual guidance, from Socrates and Plato to Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Luther King, Jr. They all represent incarnations of the divine idea, and they all contribute to the progress of the consciousness of freedom. This progression is never complete because history is a mixture of comedy and tragedy, of freedom and oppression, of good and evil. The death of God on the cross of Christ signifies that tragedy is taken up into the divine life and negated there; it continues as a negated element, and this negation gives Christians the courage to face the tragic conflicts of history. Christ, therefore, is for Christians the normative paradigm of God in history.

During the Vietnam War, he suffered the loss of both of his legs and was awarded the Navy Cross, the Marines' second-highest decoration for valor in combat.  Early life and career  Bobby D. Lain was born on April 2, 1937 in Haskell County, Texas. In 1955, he graduated from A. C. Jones High School in Beeville, Texas. Lain then attended the University of Texas on an NROTC scholarship. Upon graduating in 1959 with a bachelor's degree in geography and history, Lain was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. In 1963, Lain met his wife, who was also a Marine officer, while he was stationed at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina.  Vietnam War  By February 1967, Captain Lain was serving in Vietnam as the Bravo Company Commander, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division. On February 10, the 1st Marine Regiment launched Operation Stone in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province. On February 19, 1st Battalion became engaged with a North Vietnamese Army battalion. Lieutenant Colonel Van D. Bell directed Lain's company to cut off the enemy's last available route of escape. Lain was wounded in the foot early in the battle when he stepped on a punji stick. Despite his wound, he refused to be medically evacuated and proceeded to lead his company over approximately three miles of heavily mined and booby-trapped terrain. During the assault, Lain gave constant updates to Bell about his company's progress. Lain's company played a decisive role in the operation, trapping the NVA and inflicting over 250 enemy casualties. He then led his company in an advance to destroy the remaining enemy forces when he stepped on a landmine. The explosion resulted in the traumatic amputation of both of Lain's legs. Lain then radioed to Bell \\"I'm sorry, sir. I've lost my legs.\\" Lain then ordered his Marines to maintain fire superiority on the enemy and briefed his executive officer on the situation, relinquishing his command when he was sure victory was imminent. When the medevac helicopter arrived, Lain made sure the other wounded were loaded on the helicopter first. Lain was taken to the Navy hospital at Da Nang. Realizing his Marine Corps career was over, he decided to go back to school. For his heroism during Operation Stone, Lain was awarded the Navy Cross and the Purple Heart. He was promoted to major before he was medically retired.  Later career and life  Lain returned to the University of Texas, earning his master's degree in history in 1970, followed by his doctorate in 1974. For the next 25 years, Lain taught American History at Austin Community College. In 1999, he was awarded the ACC Teaching Excellence Award and a scholarship bearing his name was established. Lain and his wife moved to Round Top, Texas after his retirement. Bobby D. Lain died on July 4, 2012 at St. David's Hospital in Austin, Texas. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Jean-Jacques Alexis Uhrich, (born 15 February 1802 in Phalsbourg, Moselle, France, died 9 October 1886 in Paris) was a French g√©n√©ral de division (divisional general). He was the great uncle of G√©n√©ral d'arm√©e Maurice Gamelin (1872‚Äì1958). Military governor of the city of Strasbourg in 1870, Uhrich is best known for his service during the Franco- Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871) as the commander of French forces during the Siege of Strasbourg and for surrendering the city to German forces. Biography1818‚Äì1867= Jean-Jacques Uhrich attended the French military academy at Saint-Cyr from 1818 to 1820, and was a member of Saint-Cyr's first graduating class since the Bourbon Restoration.Hozier, p. 58.This first graduating class from Saint-Cyr after the Bourbon Restoration was presented to King Louis XVIII in Saint-Cloud on 8 August 1819. On that occasion, the king said to the Saint- Cyrians presented to him, \\"My children, I am very happy with you, there is not one in your ranks who does not carry in his pouch the baton of the Marshal of France of the Duke of Reggio...it's up to you to get it out.\\" Quoted in \\"La Saint-Cyrienne\\" (in French). Other notable members of his graduating class included Roch P√¢ris de Bollardi√®re (1803‚Äì1866), great-grandfather of G√©n√©ral de brigade Jacques P√¢ris de Bollardi√®re (1907‚Äì1986); the journalist and writer Armand Carrel (1800‚Äì1836), who died in a duel; and the g√©n√©ral de division and politician Prudent de Chasseloup-Laubat (1802‚Äì1863). Uhrich later graduated from the French Army‚Ä≤s Infantry School. Uhrich‚Ä≤s first assignment was to the French Army‚Ä≤s 3rd Light Infantry Regiment with the rank of sous-lieutenant. He was promoted to capitaine in 1834, and in 1848 became colonel of the 3rd Light Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade in 1852, and in 1855, during the second year of the Crimean War, he was promoted to g√©n√©ral de division. He commanded a division of the French 5th Army Corps during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859. He also served a tour as the commander of one of the territorial subdivisions of the Army of Nancy. He subsequently retired from active service in 1867 with the rank of g√©n√©ral de division and was transferred to the reserve list.archives.strasbourg.eu LES GRANDS NOMS DE L'HISTOIRE DE STRASBOURG JEAN-JACQUES UHRICH (in French) Retrieved 5 June 2020 =Siege of Strasbourg= When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, Uhrich was recalled to active service. He replaced G√©n√©ral de division Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot as commanding officer of the 6th Military DivisionHoward, p. 273. and at his own request became military governor of Strasbourg. Immediately after their victory in the Battle of W√∂rth (also known as he Battle of Reichshoffen and the Battle of Fr≈ìschwiller) on 6 August 1870, forces of the German states began to arrive at Strasbourg and initiated a siege of the city on 13 August with a force that soon reached a strength of 40,000. The German forces ‚Äî consisting of elements of the Prussian Army and of the army of the Grand Duchy of Baden ‚Äî began a desultory artillery bombardment of the city and its fortifications ‚Äî designed by S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban during the seventeenth century and obsolete by 1870Howard, pp. 272‚Äì273. ‚Äî on 14 August while the German commander, Prussian Generalmajor August von Werder, considered ways to bring the siege to a quick end.Howard, pp. 273‚Äì274. Werder informed Uhrich that his forces would begin an intensive bombardment of the city if it did not surrender, and, after Uhrich refused, the bombardment began on 23 August.Howard, p. 274. Four nights of heavy bombardment ensued, during which the municipal government asked Uhrich to propose to Werder that the city pay a ransom of 100,000 francs per day that the Germans did not bombard it, but Uhrich refused the request. On 26 August 1870, Werder ‚Äî who unbeknownst to Uhrich was running too low on ammunition to continue the bombardment at a high level of intensity ‚Äî offered a ceasefire if the city would surrender, but Uhrich refused this as well. Projecting steadiness and military professionalism, Uhrich rallied civilian opinion in Strasbourg in favor of continued resistance, and the determination of Strasbourg‚Ä≤s population to carry on stiffened military opinion against a proposed German bombardment of Paris.Howard, pp. 274‚Äì275. After the fourth night of heavy bombardment on 27 August, Werder reduced the level of bombardment to harassing fire and settled in for a long siege.Howard, p. 275. On 11 September 1870, the French in Strasbourg received news from a Swiss delegation the Germans had allowed into the city that the French Army‚Ä≤s Army of the Rhine had suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Gravelotte on 18 August 1870 and subsequently become besieged at Metz and that the Army of Ch√¢lons had been encircled and destroyed in the Battle of Sedan on 1‚Äì2 September. The twin calamities meant that no French force would arrive to relieve Strasbourg. On 17 September, the Germans succeeded in making their first breach in the city‚Ä≤s fortifications. The municipal government asked Uhrich to surrender the city on 19 September, but he refused. That day, however, the Germans penetrated further into the defenses,Howard, pp. 275‚Äì276. and on 27 September Uhrich's subordinates advised him that further defense of the city was impractical.Howard, p. 276. On 28 September, Uhrich ‚Äî expecting a final German infantry assault to take the city to begin the following day ‚Äî asked Werder for terms of surrender. Uhrich and Werder negotiated politely and treated one another chivalrously, and Werder allowed the defenders of Strasbourg to march out of the city with full battle honors, although Uhrich's angry and humiliated troops left the city in a drunken and undisciplined manner. Uhrich was paroled and left Strasbourg, traveling first to Tours and then to Switzerland, where he lived in self-imposed exile. During the Siege of Strasbourg, nearly 200,000 German artillery shells had landed in the city, doing extensive damage and leveling entire neighborhoods, leaving 10,000 people homeless. Despite this, Uhrich had held out for 46 days with a force of 10,000 men against a besieging force that reached a strength of 60,000. Uhrich nonetheless received strong criticism in France for the capitulation of Strasbourg. Many people in France viewed him as having behaved too courteously toward the enemy, claimed he had surrendered Strasbourg prematurely, and even accused him of committing an act tantamount to treason by surrendering the city. Uhrich was general councilor of the Canton of Phalsbourg until 1871. He died on 9 October 1886 and is buried in Paris in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery.Bauer, p. 757. Descendants Uhrich's niece Pauline, daughter of his brother Gustave, intendant general of the army, married Auguste Gamelin (1837‚Äì1921), father of G√©n√©ral d'arm√©e Maurice Gamelin (1872‚Äì1958), who during World War II commanded the French Army during both the Phony War period of 1939‚Äì1940 and the subsequent Battle of France in 1940.

However, because of the widespread blame placed on Uhrich for the capitulation of Strasbourg, the street was renamed Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne in 1875. In 1929, it was renamed Avenue Foch. In Nantes, the Quai de la Bourse was renamed Quai Uhrich on 4 October 1870. It still bore the name Quai Uhrich in 1906,Dugas/Pied, p. 304. but has since regained the name Quai de la Bourse.

It was established in 2003 and has changed location several times since inception, due to its uncertain legal status. The centre is wholly run and organized by volunteers and funds itself through donations and fundraising. It offers various services and activities to the community, including open space for exercise, circus-related facilities and skills training, art spaces and workshops, wood and metalworking shops fully stocked with tools and machinery, 3D printers, communal kitchen, amateur radio station, and much more. HistoryEarly days= The idea for the formation of an occupied social centre in Genoa arose in part due to opposition to the Second Gulf War and the ensuing conflict in the Middle East, as well as discontent shared by some segments of the Genoese community since the 2001 G8 meeting in the city, which led to violent confrontations and several deaths. Themes surrounding the concept included anti-capitalism, negative effects of globalization, opposition to war, a desire for sustainable development, community-building, the need for more social spaces, as well as a desire for improved living standards for the underprivileged, including migrants and refugees. Those involved in organizing the ensuing occupations and the eventual social centre included members of the Communist Refoundation Party, environmental activists, anarchist and pacifist adherents, as well as students. At the start of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the US-led coalition, a grassroots group of activists occupied a building in Via Milano for one week as a form of protest. This shared experience strengthened the collective and helped them solidify their goals, one of which was the desire for a permanent physical location to organize activities and present an alternative for community gatherings. The former Faculty of Economics at Via Bertani 1 was occupied on the morning of 11 May 2003. The building, owned by the University of Genoa, had been empty and in a state of neglect for several years. Inside, the occupants found thousands of books, which the university was compelled to remove after a few days. Some weeks after the occupation began, the name Buridda was chosen to represent the newly-formed organization. The name is a reference to the typical Ligurian seafood soup and alludes to the diversity of the components participating in the occupation. =Via Bertani= The first project put into practice at Buridda was the creation of a ham radio station. This was done in a few weeks, and it was given the name Radio Babylon. Limited broadcasts began on the FM frequency, covering a small radius around the occupied building. After less than two months from the time it began to transmit, however, the station was raided by the Polizia Postale, a branch of the Italian State Police, who seized all radio equipment, claiming that the transmissions created interference on Savona fire brigade frequencies. Despite this setback, Buridda remained active. The collective opened up the space they occupied to anyone in the city wishing to hold social, cultural, or other group projects. In a short time, the building filled up with people and activities, and within a few years, it became a point of reference in the counter-cultural sphere of Genoa. Buridda was used for various activities including theatre, craft workshops, study groups, music rehearsals and recording, computer labs, musical events, as well as the first Fab lab in Italy. The site established its own recording studio, concert space, boxing gym, and climbing gym, among others. The social centre was regularly used for concerts and cultural events including Critical Wine, an annual fair for small-scale wine producers held in different parts of the country each year. =Eviction and new space= The official status of the occupied building out of which Buridda was based has always been disputed and mired in controversy. Initially owned by the University of Genoa, it was eventually purchased by Giuseppe Pericu shortly before his term as mayor of Genoa ended. On 4 June 2014, the police raided the squat at Via Bertani 1 and evicted all its occupants. This proved to be an unpopular move on the part of the city, and an outpouring of online support was seen immediately following the drastic police action. Within a few weeks, the Buridda collective had found a new space to occupy at Corso Montegrappa 39. On 7 June, they temporarily occupied Garaventa, an abandoned elementary school in the historic centre of the city. Following this, the group planned a large rally for June 14. The event took place as planned, and an estimated 2,000 people took part in the procession. The municipal police, under the impression that the squatters would try to reoccupy Via Bertani 1, kept the building under armed guard. The procession, however, was headed for Corso Montegrappa; once they reached it, they triumphantly entered their new residence, the former Magisterium of Genoa, inaugurated by Benito Mussolini in 1937, and owned by the University of Genoa. As of March 2020, Buridda is still located at this address. =Sale threats= In 2016, the University of Genoa notified the residents of Buridda that they would be switching off power to the building and selling the property after 15 years of disuse. In March of that year, they followed through on that threat and the power was turned off. The collective was forced to improvise with self-organized renewable energy sources in order to power the building again. In August 2016, the University listed the building for auction at a starting price of almost ‚Ç¨3 million. As of March 2020, the building has been listed for auction three times but remains unsold. During the first listing, a rumour circulated about a possible offer from the Mormon Church.
