It is a ground orchid which grows singly or in small groups, has a single dark green, hairy leaf and a single yellowish-green flower with red stripes. It is only known from a few sites and has been classified as Endangered. Description Caladenia amoena is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, densely hairy, lance-shaped leaf, long and wide which often has purplish blotches near its base. A single flower (rarely two) is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal is erect, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and about wide. It is narrower near the end which terminates in a glandular structure about long. The lateral sepals are oblong to lance-shaped, long, about wide and end in a gland similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long and taper to a point. The labellum is heart- shaped, curves forward, long and wide when flattened. The labellum has three yellowish-green lobes, reddish in the central part, the middle lobe with about 7 pairs of broad teeth. The lateral lobes are also toothed near the mid-lobe. There are four rows of foot-shaped calli which are reddish and about at the back of the labellum, decreasing in size towards the front. The column is long and has reddish markings. Flowering occurs from August to October. Caladenia amoena is similar to C. concinna but has smaller flowers and somewhat drooping petals and sepals. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia amoena was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1994 and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (amoena) is a Latin word meaning \\"pleasant\\" or \\"delightful\\". Distribution and habitat Charming spider orchid is only known from two sites, growing in grassy box‚Äìironbark forest in south-central Victoria, on the northern outskirts of Melbourne. Conservation Only 45 Caladenia amoena plants were known in 2000 and the species is classified as \\"Endangered\\" by the Victorian government. It is also classed as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and a recovery plan has been prepared.

Biography Nicknamed \\"Stuin\\" (Stefanino), he enlisted as an officer in the Italian Royal Navy and earned his pilots license on seaplanes. In 1927 he was assigned to the Seaplanes Experimental Center in Vigna di Valle in the town of Bracciano (Rome), at the namesake lake where he was able to stand out for his skills, so much so that the Secretary of State for Aviation Italo Balbo wanted him as an instructor to perfect his own piloting of seaplanes. The powerful Quadrumviro was so impressed by the young lieutenant's skills that since then always put the utmost confidence in him as a pilot and as a collaborator, entrusting him with important assignments and choosing him as his own personal co-pilot in the Air Cruises that would see them soon protagonists. The \\"Cruises\\" The year after in 1928, Balbo appointed Cagna to study the feasibility and preparations for the accomplishment of the Western Mediterranean Cruise from May 26 to June 2 with a formation of SIAI S.9bis and Savoia-Marchetti S.55 for a total of 61 planes. The raid was carried out along a route that started and finished in Orbetello, covering 2,804 kilometers in training and touching various parts of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first of a series of prestigious demonstrative air campaigns, with whom Balbo wanted to impress the international community about the abilities of the young Italian Air Force. Unlike what happened in the lonely flies, individual crews completed long runs on challenges that most exalted the courage of the individual, the head of the Regia Aeronautica preferred to organize \\"flying fleets\\", in which a substantial number of aircraft he himself commanded in flight, they ran long distances to demonstrate the progress of technology and reliability of the Italian aeronautical solutions. In these trasvolate, Italo Balbo would always carry Stefano Cagna as co-pilot and as a valuable help in the organization. The rescue of the \\"Red Tent\\" Returned from his flights across the Mediterranean, Air Secretary Balbo decided to send out Cagna as a co-pilot of the already famous aviator Umberto Maddalena on a Savoia-Marchetti S.55A to the rescue of General Umberto Nobile, who had crashed on the Arctic sea ice on May 25 and attended on the ice shell with some survivors in the famous \\"red tent\\" after the disaster of the airship Italia. The two, driven by land from the shipwrecked airship by means of a rudimentary wireless system, succeeded, despite great difficulties due to weather conditions, to find and supply the unfortunate explorers on the ice, allowing them to survive until July 12, the date of arrival of the Krassin icebreaker that brought them to safety. After this feat, he was awarded the gold medal to the aviation value and was granted with the rank of lieutenant in the Italian Royal Air Force leaving the Regia Marina. Italo Balbo wanted him with him as a flight assistant, and in all subsequent flights across the Atlantic firmly as co- pilot particularly in the Transatlantic aerial Cruise Italy-Brazil and in the Decennial Air Cruise. Brigadier General In 1938, Cagna helped Air Marshal Balbo in creating the first unit of the Italian Army paratroopers, the Fanti dell'Aria, at the airport of Castel Benito whose Stefano Cagna himself was responsible. He was appointed Air force chief in Libya and appointed Brigadier General on March 16, 1939 at only 38 years old, the youngest general in Italy. He left Libya in 1940 when he accepted the task of reorganizing the Italian civil aviation, thereby separating himself from Balbo for the first time in his career. After Italy's entry into World War II on June 10, 1940 and the death of Balbo, shot down in the skies of Tobruk in an episode of \\"friendly fire\\" by Italian anti-aircraft artillery on June 28 of that year, he returned to operational employ when he was given command of the X Air Brigade Terrestrial Bombing \\"Mars\\" based in Cagliari-Elmas equipped with the three- engined Savoia-Marchetti SM79 bomber. Death At the command of his bombers air-brigade, he engaged personally in the first risky enforcement operations against British convoys in the Mediterranean organized to supply Malta. On August 1, 1940, all British ships in the Mediterranean coordinated to implement Operation Hurry,http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_hurry.html whose intent was to convey 12 Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta to strengthen the defensive capabilities of the island. General Cagna attacked with his SM79 the British H Force from Gibraltar, but off the Balearic Islands his plane, flying at the ceiling of 2,500 meters to center more effectively the enemy ships, was hit by violent anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the sea, killing him and all his crew,https://theaviationist.com/tag/stefano-cagna/ including Lt.

Michotte, Une soir√©e chez Rossini √† Beau-S√©jour (Passy), 1858 (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, FEM-801) The Edmond Michotte collection is a donation to the Royal Conservatory of Brussels phased between 1897 and 1913, by the Belgian homonymous composer and musicographer, of an important part of the private library of Rossini with whom he became friendly.  Biography  Born into a wealthy Belgian noble family, Edmond Michotte (1831‚Äì1914) was educated in Belgium and Paris. Back in his home country after the 1848 revolution, he chose to start music studies after an aborted bachelorship in Philosophy at the Free University of Brussels. A pianist and composer, he gained a wide reputation as a performer on the mattauphoneInstrument developed by Joseph Mattau, inspired by Benjamin Franklin's famous glass harmonica, made of a leg-mounted box containing a series of water-filled glasses that resonate when their edge is rubbed with the hand or the finger. virtuoso. From 1854 he lived between Brussels and Paris, where he moved in the celebrity circles of the musical crowd and became acquainted with Rossini ‚Äì then almost forty years his senior ‚Äì who considered him as his quasi figlio. After having had the opportunity to attend the meeting of the composer with Richard Wagner, he published a short review of the event.Edmond Michotte, La visite de Wagner √† Rossini, Paris 1860, Bruxelles, 1906. Back in Belgium in 1870, he became a member of several associations and presided over the vigilance committee of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels to which he donated his vast Rossinian collection in subsequent phases. He died in 1914 after a missile hit his house in Leuven, without having achieved his ambition to dedicate a museum to his illustrious friend and protector. Photo of Rossini from Nadar, dedicated to Edmond Michotte (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, FEM-932)  The collection  Appreciated by Rossinian scholarsE.g. Philip Gossett, who explored the Michotte collection in Brussels in 2014 (cf. bibliography). for the rarity of certain documents, the Michotte collection essentially contains pieces from Rossini's library: handwritten and printed scores, books, libretti and various publications, correspondence, iconographic material and various objects. = Autographs and printed scores = The collection contains close to 300 musical manuscripts, amongst which 26 are autograph; the majority of these are works by Rossini, including 180 compositions pertaining to the lyrical repertoire ‚Äì mostly unedited airs, fragments or variations ‚Äì written for the soprano Isabella Colbran (1785‚Äì1845), his first wife and creator of major roles, as well as vocal and instrumental music. The collection includes the handwritten score of Matilde di Shabran (1821) ‚Äì a minor work of the composer, but the only one in Belgium.The Italian musicologist Rita Marchetti, having analyzed and compared this manuscript to the edition of the score in Rome in 1821 (also present in the Michotte collection), has ascertained the absence of nine scenes. which sheds light on the evolution of Rossini's bel canto. Cavatine of La Sonnambula (s.d.) (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, FEM-881) Among some forty manuscripts from other composers is the autograph version of Six Polonaises D824, op. 61 from Schubert although no information is available as to how it became part of Rossini's library. = Books, libretti and various publications = The Michotte collection also comprises 420 titles of musical editions, of which approximately 120 are by Rossini, and 300 Italian or French publications from the XIXe century, as well as a complete edition of the works of J.S. Bach and of Beethoven's symphonies. It is complemented by a precious collection of libretti of the first performances of Rossini, carefully assembled and bound by his father. Other publications, many of which contain a dedication to Rossini, are of a different nature, but undoubtedly belonged to the shelves of the musician, such as the 1818 edition of Dante's Divina Commedia and the R√©pertoire g√©n√©ral du th√©√¢tre fran√ßais. Monographs and press articles concerning Rossini, several printed programmes of the Soir√©es musicales ‚Äì private concerts organised in Paris by the composer and his second wife Olympe P√©lissier ‚Äì give witness to the esthetic taste of the time. = Correspondence = Caricature of Rossini by A. Gill, 1864 (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, FEM-883) The collection includes more than two hundred letters and different handwritten texts ‚Äì invitations, programs, poetry, furniture inventories, condolences, or the impressive list of celebrities attending the composer's funeral. The correspondence, of which half is autograph, holds some thirty letters from Rossini to his Bolognese secretary, Angelo Mignani, the others being addressed to the composer himself. = Iconographic material and various objects = The iconographic part of the collection, representing some hundred fifty images, covers lithographs of the young Rossini, photos ‚Äì some by Nadar ‚Äì of the old artist, his funeral and his exhumation, or of portraits of his parents, as well as some engravings featuring Colbran. The personal objects in this section include a fan-formed vase with seven musical quotations from Rossini, representing the allegory of the ¬´ swan of Pesaro¬ª, next to a miniature biscuit bust, a paper cutter, a pince-nez and a tie-pin offered by Bellini.

Founded in 1945 the club plays in the National Division 2 Aquitaine regional league. Home games are played at the impressive Stade Lucien Desprats.  History  Founded in 1945 by Norbert Issaly, who would be the new club's first chairman, and Raymond Rouviere who was the club's first secretary, Cahors XIII as they were then called had a tough start to life. The new club had no ground as the local rugby club opposed them and blocked their attempts to access any land and for their first match at Lavardac XIII the club had to borrow shirts from US Villeneuve XIII. The green and white shirts borrowed would remain the club colours until 1990. A home ground was finally secured when they were allowed to use the playing fields at a local school, Gambetta High School whose head teacher was a rugby league fan. For season 46/47 the club moved to their own stadium the Stade Lucien Desprats which they have used ever since. Sadly in 1959 the club disbanded and wasn't resurrected until 1969 when local businessman Louis Baldy reformed the club under a new name AS Cadurcienne. In season 74/75 the newly named club won their first trophy when after beating Realmont XIII 9-8 in the National League 1 they were promoted to the top flight. After relegation from the top flight, the club in 1984 were relegated from the 2nd tier and found themselves in the National 2. In 87/88 they won the league and were promoted back to the 2nd tier National League 1, In the final they beat RC Lescure- Arthes XIII 17-8. The following season they reached the league semi-finals but lost out to Pamiers XIII. A change of colours to the cities blue and white didn't bring with it any good luck as a major sponsor pulled out of the club in 1992 leaving them in severe financial trouble, relegation to the bottom tier soon followed. A decade in the National 2 division followed, in which only a play-off defeat to Le Barcares XIII, 10-29, in 1999 got them anywhere near promotion. In 2004 it was announced that AS Cadurcienne and Villefranche de Rouerge XIII would join forces to become Union Villefranche-Cahors abbreviated to UVC and that they compete in the top tier Elite One Championship. In 2007 the partnership was ended and Cahors Lot XIII were born and began life in the bottom tier National Division 2.

Other groups, such as religious minorities including Muslims, have also supported the Morcha. The impetus for the rallies is the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in Kopardi village, Maharashtra, on 13 July 2016.The protesters have demanded the death sentence for the rapists. It is not politically motivated social movement. In fact, Maratha caste is the largest caste of India and dominate the power structure in Maharashtra because of their numerical strength, especially in the rural society. The rallies feature no leaders and no slogans. Millions of people from all parts of Maharashtra came together to protest, and initially no harm was done to any public or private property until a few instances of violence were noted in January 2017. The demand for reservations in educational positions and government jobs has also been a part of these protests. Recently, the Bombay High Court upheld the reservations granted to the Maratha community but also mentioned that the percentage of quotas given wasn't justifiable.A large percentage of Marathis are farmers, and the community has been severely affected by droughts and degraded arable land. Due to the lack of reservations, unemployment has become a major problem in the Maratha community. Some castes within the Maratha community, known as Kunbi, do receive the benefits of reservations provided to the Other Backward Class category; however, most people are allegedly out of benefits. More than 95% of the Maratha are socially and educationally backward.  Demands  * Punishment of culprits in the Kopardi rape and murder case * Reservations in educational positions and government jobs * Implementation of recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers chaired by Dr. M.

The non-cooperation movement covers non-payment of taxes to government and local bodies until reservations are implemented.  Impact  After continuously growing protests in each city and millions of people's participation in each Maratha Kranti Morcha, on 13 October 2016 the Government of Maharashtra took the decisions to: and * Increase the upper limit of the Economically Backward Class (EBC) to Rs.6,00,000, and announced the extension of monetary benefits under this category to students from all castes (Marathi). Students from the EBC category studying in all professional courses would be eligible for benefits such as fee reimbursement under the Rajshri Shahu Maharaj Scheme (Marathi) (Marathi)(Marathi) (Marathi) (Marathi), which was named after the Maratha king Rajshri Shahu of Kolhapur, who introduced the first reservation policy in the kingdom of Kolhapur State. * Create provisions for children of small landholding farmers under the Panjabrao Deshmukh Scheme (Marathi) (Marathi) (Marathi). As the Bombay high court had stayed the 16% reservation granted to Marathas in government jobs and educational positions on the grounds that the data used by the government was faulty, the Government of Maharashtra on 5 December 2016 filed a 2,800-page affidavit to justify the reservations for Marathas as legal and show that it did not violate constitutional provisions. The affidavit contained documents substantiating the claim that the community is socially and educationally backward.

Present in invertebrates and some lower vertebrate species, they have been extensively studied in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster. OSCs allow the production of new female reproductive cells (oocytes) by the process of oogenesis during an organism's reproductive life.  Invertebrates  = Caenorhabditis elegans = Development of oogonial stem cells in C. elegans adult hermaphrodites The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) are nematodes can have hermaphroditic or male reproductive capabilities. In males, only spermatogenesis occurs; hermaphrodites can produce spermatozoa until adulthood, when oogenesis takes over. All oogonial stem cells in C. elegans are derived from one distal-tip cell (DTC), which acts as a niche to ensure that germline proliferation continues. As the DTC undergoes mitosis, the cells move proximally along the organism and passing from the mitotic-proliferative region into the meiotic cycle. During this cycle, the cells complete meiotic prophase before passing into the zone of oogenesis (or spermatogenesis, depending on the sex and age of the organism). = D. melanogaster = Drosophila ovary Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster), commonly known as the fruit fly, is a dioecious (two-sex) invertebrate. Female D. melanogasters have two ovaries, each of which have 16 ovarioles. The linear development from oogonial stem cells to mature oocyte is similar to that of C. elegans. In D. melanogaster, the 14-stage development of the oocyte is from the anterior to the posterior ovariole. Mature oocytes are then stored in the uterus after passing through the oviduct, to wait for the egg deposition.  Vertebrates  In mammals, oogenesis is believed to be primarily prenatal. The existence of oogonial stem cells in mammals is controversial, except for the finding of OSCs in two species of loris and three species of bat. In 2004, considerable evidence was provided for the existence of germline stem cells in adult mouse ovaries capable of generating oocytes to form new follicles. Questions exist about cell-sorting techniques used to isolate the OSCs, and some researchers prefer the less-conclusive term \\"female germline stem cells\\" to \\"OSCs\\". New research indicates that oogonial stem cells do not exist in mice and there is no convincing evidence they exist in other mammals.  Research  A study published in 2015 reported that the formation of new oocytes from newly- discovered germline stem cells, known as oogonial stem cells, has opened new avenues for the treatment of female infertility. Research by Zuckerman et al. published in 1951, established a central dogma that neo-oogenesis in mammals does not occur postnatally. These conclusions were supported by other researches, such as Peters et al., who investigated DNA synthesis in oocytes during embryonic development. However, since they didn‚Äôt study oogenesis postnatally, they could not make any conclusions about postnatal oogenesis. In 1967, Loannou et al., studied proliferation of oogonia and sought to identify whether they were undergoing mitosis. They would be able to show this if there was observance of mitotic activity and whether or not they were contributing to stem cell populations. To do this, they used haematoxylin stains to stain for mitotic divisions. However, these results were inconclusive as they did not have oocyte markers and thus could not say for sure that these cells were a part of the stem cell population.Horan C H & Williams S A 2017 Oocyte stem cells: fact or fantasy? Reproduction Review 1470-1626 A number of scientists have since then used mathematical models to suggest that, without an oocyte stem cell (OSC) population, the female mammal will not have enough oocytes to complete their reproductive lives due to rate of atresia during the normal cycle is significant. However, in 2004, new research by Jonathan Tilly and colleagues came about to suggest that a new population of stem cells in female mammals does exist, which could possibly be used for personalized therapeutics. Using mouse studies, they were able to detect OSCs that were able to generate new eggs within these mouse ovaries. Tilly et al. used GFP to try to label the OSCs, but they didn‚Äôt know exactly where to find these stem cell populations, so it is difficult to say whether somatic cells or stem cells were labeled. This study challenged previously expected notions, as it contradicted the central dogma of oogenesis, and has thus led to a rapid increase in the amount of researching being conducted to suggest whether there does indeed exist oocyte stem cells in the mammalian ovary. Lineage tracing and other studies, following initial observations in Tilly's lab, have found no supporting evidence for oogonial stem cells. Not a single laboratory in United States has been able to reproduce these findings.

Hackers is a cyberwarfare strategy game, and has been likened to the video game Uplink. On iOS the game has an added suffix: Hackers - Join the Cyberwar. A screenshot from the game. Players get to design a network of offensive and defensive nodes as they fight for their countries in a futuristic world war.Players take on the role of a Hacker during a fictional First World Cyberwar. Players can develop and secure their own virtual 3D network and hack various targets around the world. Players can research programs, hack networks to increase their reputation and resources, and compete against other countries. The overarching strategy is to build a robust enough network to protect your data, while finding the best tools to use against others. The game features 70+ story missions with multiple ways to defeat them. There are also player-created networks to be infiltrated, which raise the position of your country on the global leaderboard. The game also has a developed ARG, starting from an in-game mission. Story Hackers takes place in an alternate reality, where a piece of software (codenamed Ergo) was designed to make hacking into systems easier. The software has been made available to the public, so that anyone and everyone can get into hacking. But unlike real-world hacking which consists of command line usage and programming, this alternate reality puts systems and the hacking process into a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to make things easier to try and hack other people. The game starts you out performing simple hacks with a recently met acquaintance called \\"Marty\\". As the game progresses you are introduced to other characters representing various factions such as StormCorp, MIRAGE, Cyber Alliance, Eastern Coalition and DejaVu. During the course of the story you get to experience various security, activist and terrorist missions that test your skills as a hacker. Development The game was developed in-house by Trickster Arts. The game was developed in Unity Engine. Development was started in Summer 2014. While working on Hero of Many the developers started working in parallel on another project. This project was cancelled for design reasons and Hackers was created from old gaming design notes out of the desire to keep the company going.

Halleux at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels After having obtained the coveted Prix Vieuxtemps in 1912, Laurent Halleux (1897-1964), born in the Belgian city of Verviers where he studies at the local Conservatory, concludes his educational journey at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels with C√©sar Thomson and obtains the first violin prize in 1914. From 1912 onwards, aged only fifteen, he plays the second violin with his fellow students Alphonse Onnou, Germain Pr√©vost and Fernand Quinet in the Pro Arte Quartet, that will receive, in 1932, thanks to its international popularity, the title of ¬´ Quartet to the Belgian Court ¬ª. Renowned for the interpretation of modernist and avant-garde works including those of Stravinsky, Milhaud, Honegger or Martin≈Ø, the quartet is also impassioned with the classic repertoire. On the eve of WWII, three of the four members of the quartet migrate to the United States,Not having been able to follow his fellow colleagues to the States for health reasons, Robert Maas, who had replaced Fernand Quinet in 1921, remains in Belgium. but when Onnou dies shortly after (1940), Halleux leaves the band in 1943 to successively join the Roth Quartet, the New London String Quartet and the Hungarian String Quartet.

To this same contingent belongs the Czech ‚Äì naturalised American ‚Äì composer Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, with whom the Pro Arte Quartet maintained a privileged relationship, as it brought two of his worksThe Concerto for orchestra and string quartet (1932) and the Quartet n¬∞5 (1838). in world premi√®re and held several of his works in its repertoire. = An unicum = Version 1 of the Quartet n¬∞2 of Roy Harris (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, CR-02083) While it has been established that several manuscripts of the Halleux collection, autographs or copies, supported the worldwide or European creation of certain pieces such as the Quartet n¬∞2 of Jerzy Fitelberg, the Quartet n¬∞1 on Indian themes of Frederik Jacobi or 4 Indiscretions of Louis Gruenberg, the score of Quartet n¬∞2 of Roy Harris, also globally premiered, represents a remarkable case: two handwritten versions of the same piece coexist, esp. of the third movement. = Stravinsky and the non-American composers = The Halleux collection also comprises autograph manuscripts of non-American composers including the Belgians Jean Absil and Marcel Poot, the French Darius Milhaud and Albert Roussel, the Austrian Artur Schnabel or the British Frank Bridge.

Close to the Belgian Paul Collaer, founder of the Pro Arte Concerts, the Russian composer (naturalised French in 1934, American in 1945) has benefitted from the unconditional support of the quartet for the international diffusion of his music. Version 2 of the Quartet n¬∞2 of Roy Harris (Library of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, B-Bc, CR-02083) The Halleux collection is particularly adequate for the study of American music from the early 20th century, and in particular of film music developed on this continent.

The concept was first introduced by N.E. Skakkaebaek in a research paper along with the department of Growth and Reproduction in Copenhagen University. The paper suggests the origin and underlying cause of TDS can be detected as early as in fetal life, where environmental and genomic factors could affect the development of the male reproductive system.  Causes  Central to the cause of irreversible TDS are disruptions to early fetal testes development. This has both genetic, environmental, and lifestyle components, however the rapid increase in the incidence of the disorders associated with TDS in the last decades indicates that it is under a powerful environmental influence. The fetal origins of TDS are reinforced by the high incidence of TDS disorders found occurring together in one individual. = Genetic = Many genes have been implicated in the disorders of TDS, with genome wide association studies (GWAS) regularly identifying new gene variants that play a role in abnormal testes development. Some of these are specific to certain disorders, and some are part of a 'risk factor network' that connect TGCC, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, poor semen quality. The majority of these genes are involved in fetal gonad development. Mutations in androgen receptor genes are highly implicated, as these are involved in penile development, testes descent, and testes development. Testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC) shows a strong genetic disposition, with the most significant gene variants being those linked to gonad formation and germ cell function. = Environmental = Exposure of a male fetus to substances that disrupt hormone systems, particularly chemicals that inhibit the action of androgens (male sex hormones) during the development of the reproductive system, has been shown to cause many of the characteristic TDS disorders. These include environmental estrogens and anti- androgens found in food and water sources that have been contaminated with synthetic hormones and pesticides used in agriculture. In historical cases, medicines given to pregnant women, like diethylstilbestrol (DES), have caused many of the features of TDS in fetuses exposed to this chemical during gestation. The impact of environmental chemicals is well documented in animal models. If a substance affects Sertoli and Leydig cell differentiation (a common feature of TDS disorders) at an early developmental stage, germ cell growth and testosterone production will be impaired. These processes are essential for testes descent and genitalia development, meaning that genital abnormalities like cryptorchidism or hypospadias may be present from birth, and fertility problems and TGCC become apparent during adult life. Severity or number of disorders may therefore be dependent on the timing of the environmental exposure. Environmental factors can act directly, or via epigenetic mechanisms, and it is likely that a genetic susceptibility augmented by environmental factors is the primary cause of TDS. = Lifestyle = Links between maternal smoking and TDS are tenuous, but there are stronger associations between maternal alcohol consumption and incidences of cryptorchidism in sons. Smoking does however affect the growth of a fetus, and low birth weight is shown to increase the likelihood of all the disorders encompassed by TDS. Maternal obesity, resulting in gestational diabetes, has also been shown to be a risk factor for impaired testes development and TDS symptoms in sons.  Pathogenesis  Schematic diagram illustrating the pathogenic links that lead to TDS. CIS = carcinoma in situ; GC = Germ CellThe TDS hypothesis proposes that testicular dysgenesis, which has various primary causes, can lead to abnormalities in Sertoli and/or Leydig cell function. This leads to both impaired germ cell development and hormonal changes during male sexual differentiation. For instance, insufficient production of testosterone can result in incomplete masculinisation, whilst reduced expression of insulin-like factor 3 can lead to incomplete testes descent. The downstream disorders of such abnormalities can include both genital malformations (e.g. hypospadias and cryptorchidism) and delayed reproductive disorders (e.g. testicular cancer and poor semen quality) which comprise TDS.  Diagnosis  Hypospadias Cryptorchidism - Can see one missing testicle = Hypospadias = Hypospadias presents as an abnormal location for the end of the urethra which is typically found on the distal end of the penis. It is generally diagnosed at birth from visual confirmation of the hallmark features. As well as an unusual location of the urethra, the prepuce (foreskin) is typically incomplete as well. The abnormal ‚Äòhooded‚Äô prepuce is what often draws attention to the condition but can occur separately to hypospadias. = Cryptorchidism = In Cryptorchidism a diagnosis is made from a physical examination which is performed when the baby is lacking one or both testes in the dependant portion of the scrotal sac. 70% of cryptorchid testes can be felt and are unable to be pulled into the scrotum or retreats quickly after being pulled into a higher position. In 30% of cases the testes cannot be felt indicating an intra-abdominal location. The risk factors for Cryptorchidism are: * A family history of the condition * Low birth weight * Prematurity = Poor semen quality = Human sperm stained for semen analysis Poor semen quality is measured not only by the number of sperm a man produces but also by how effective the sperm is at fertilising an egg. The motility and shape of the sperm are important for this role. A man with poor semen quality will often present with fertility problems which is defined as a couple trying to conceive for over 1 year with no success. Diagnosis can be made from semen analysis, taking a sample of the man's semen and running tests to count numbers and quality of the individual sperm. = Testicular cancer = The most common presentation of testicular cancer is a hard, painless lump which can be felt on one of the testis. It is either noticed by a clinician during a routine examination, or the patient themselves. Risk factors for TC include: * Cryptorchidism * Family history * Previous testicular cancer The diagnosis is confirmed in different ways. An ultrasound scan can be used to diagnose to a 90-95% accuracy. Bloods can also be taken to look for elevated tumour markers which is also used to analyse the patient's response to treatment. 80% of testicular cancer cases are from the 20-34 year old age range  Treatment   References  Category:Testicle disorders Category:Syndromes ","title":"Testicular dysgenesis syndrome"},{"id":"51778144","title":"Khin Moe Nwe"},{"id":"51778148","text":"The 1930 New South Wales state election was for 90 electoral districts each returning a single member with compulsory preferential voting.

This is often described as a body mass index (BMI) over 30. However, BMI does not account for whether the excess weight is fat or muscle, and is not a measure of body composition. For most people, however, BMI is an indication used worldwide to estimate nutritional status. Obesity is usually the result of consuming more calories than the body needs and not expending that energy by doing exercise. There are genetic causes and hormonal disorders that causes people to gain significant amounts of weight but this is rare. People in the obese category are much more likely to suffer from fertility problems than people of normal healthy weight. A report carried out by the Nurses Health Study demonstrated an increased risk of anovulation in women with an increasing BMI value. Its major effects include a reduction in ovulation rate, a decline in oocyte quality, menstrual irregularities, a decreased pregnancy rate and a rise in miscarriages. Obesity can have particularly damaging effects in young women as they begin menstruating earlier than non-obese girls, essentially enhancing the defects associated with obesity and fertility. Obesity also affects fertility in men.  Epidemiology  On a global scale, there are more people who are obese than underweight. This finding occurs in every region worldwide with the exception of parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Previously, obesity and overweight were considered problems nearly exclusive to high-income countries; however, the prevalence of these health problems is now rising in low- and middle- income countries. Moreover, obesity and overweight are health issues which are more prevalent in urban areas compared to rural areas. Since 1975, obesity rates have tripled worldwide. As of 2016, 1.9 billion adults (aged 18 years or older) were classified as being overweight, and within these adults, 650 million were classified as obese. This translates to 39% of adults (39% of men and 40% of women) being overweight and 13% of the adult population worldwide (11% of men and 15% of women) being obese in 2016. An estimated 38.2 million under 5 years of age were either overweight or obese as of 2019. In Africa, the number of overweight children under 5 years of age has increased by 24% percent since 2000. Almost half of the children under 5 who were overweight or obese in 2019 lived in Asia. In 2016, over 340 million children and adolescents from ages 5‚Äì19 were overweight or obese. 124 million children and adolescents aged 5‚Äì19 (6% of girls and 8% of boys) were obese in 2016, as compared to 1975 where obesity affected just under 1% of children and adolescents in this age range. The prevalence of obesity and overweight amongst children and adolescents in this age group has significantly risen from 4% in 1975 to just above 18% in 2016. This marked increase in the rate among children has occurred similarly in both boys and girls, reflected in the 2016 statistic where 18% of girls and 19% of boys were overweight. 24.5% of reproductive age women (age 20‚Äì44 years) are estimated to be overweight and 23.0% of reproductive age women are estimated to be obese. It has also been shown that the risk of infertility amongst obese women due to disrupted ovulation is 2.7%. For adult women who are obese and are reproductively active, each unit increase in BMI over a BMI of 32 kg/m2 is associated with a reduction of spontaneous conception rate by 5%. Obesity and overweight among women of reproductive age have been associated with reduced success of conception and a higher risk of complications during pregnancy. Individuals who are obese are at an increased risk of death compared to individuals who are classified as normal weight. This increased risk persists for those who are classified as class 2 and 3 obese.  Women  Higher weights have been shown to impair fertility by inhibiting reproductive hormones. Obesity disrupts normal endocrine function, leading to irregularities in ovulation, endometrial development, and embryo development. Adipocytes (fat cells) secrete proteins and signaling molecules known as adipokines. Certain adipokines have been implicated in reducing fertility in women. = Hormonal Disruption = In women with non-disrupted reproduction function, they hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis facilitates proper ovulation and egg implantation. Through producing gonadotropic and steroid hormones, the HPO is responsible for follicular and oocyte development. However, the regulatory functions of the HPO can be disrupted due to the up or down regulation of certain hormones in the setting of obesity.  Insulin  One such disruptor of proper HPO function is insulin. Obesity, particularly the presence of visceral fat (fat around the abdomen), is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance refers to cell's reduced sensitivity to insulin, leading to the reduced ability to uptake glucose from the blood and high levels of circulation insulin. The elevated blood insulin levels can disrupt gonadotropin release. Insulin has been shown to increase androgen production, leading to hyperandrogenism. These androgens are converted to estrogen which exert negative feedback on the HPO, leading to down regulation of the HPO and limiting gonadotropin production. This hyperinsulinemia and resulting hyperandrogenism have been associated with disruptions in ovulation. Adiponectin, the protein secreted in greatest amounts from adipocytes, functions to increase the sensitivity of cells to insulin. Circulating adiponectin levels have been shown to be reduced in obese women. These reduced levels of adiponectin have also been associated with insulin resistance.  Leptin  Leptin is a satiety adipokine released from adipocytes. Normally, leptin interacts with leptin receptors (LEPRs) in the brain in order to decrease hunger and facilitate energy expenditure. In obesity, the greater number of adipocytes release greater amounts of leptin. These higher levels of leptin have been implicated in disrupted endometrial maturation and embryo implantation in to the endometrium. Leptin may also inhibit the production of certain steroids, such as progesterone, which is also necessary for proper endometrial development. Leptin is also a product of the ob gene. Due to leptin's interaction with the hypothalamus to decrease appetite, therefore a mutation in the obese gene would result in an increased appetite, leading to obesity. Leptin has been found to be linked to the HPG axis as it can induce the release of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus and subsequently follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and leutinising hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary. Pre-pubertal individuals that lack leptin fail to reach the pubertal stage. If given leptin administratively, the mutation would be reversed and puberty resumed. Leptin is further expressed in mature follicles produced by the ovary, suggesting it plays a role in oocyte maturation, hence embryo development. = Inflammation and Oxidative Stress = Obesity has been associated with higher levels of circulating triglycerides and inflammatory markers. Pro-inflammatory adipokines secreted by adipocytes have been demonstrated to stimulate fatty acid accumulation. Fatty acids are normally stored in adipocytes as triglycerides. However, as triglycerides accumulate in adipocytes, fatty acids can deposit in other tissues. These fatty acids can create oxidative stress, disrupting the functions of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula, leading to apoptosis. This process is known as lipotoxicity. Lipotoxicity can impair follicular development, lead to errors in meiotic divisions, and disrupt the implantation of the trophoblast in the endometrium. Lipotoxicity can further contribute to insulin resistance in the setting of an inflammatory state. = Polycystic ovarian syndrome = Increasing body weight is also thought to be linked to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a very common endocrine disorder among women who are reproductively active with a prevalence of 5-10%. Many women who have PCOS are also obese, and it is estimated that the prevalence of obesity in women with PCOS is 35 - 63%. PCOS diagnosis is defined by the Rotterdam criteria of having at least two of the following: polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism, and ovulatory dysfunction. Polycystic ovaries can be viewed by the ultrasound, and it will show multiple, small cysts in the ovaries. Some symptoms that people may experience with PCOS are irregular periods, acne, infertility, and excessive hair growth. PCOS is associated with excess levels of male hormones (androgens) or hyperandrogenism. Studies have shown that hyperandrogenism could be caused by a reaction between ovarian theca cells and reactive oxygen species. Hyperandrogenism in women results in menstrual abnormalities, insulin resistance, and ovarian dysfunction in the body. Obesity interferes with the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) Axis. The HPO Axis is a tightly regulated cycle of female hormones that control female reproduction. In a female with the absence of PCOS, gonadotropin and other steroid hormone are tightly regulated for follicular development. The ovary also plays a vital role in releasing steroid hormones for follicular maturation and oocyte development. After the oocyte develops into an egg, the egg is released and implanted into the lining of the uterus (endometrium). In the absence of fertilization of a sperm, the endometrium lining will shed, and menstruation will occur in a 28-day cycle. Hyperandrogenism can disrupt this cycle and decrease follicular maturation, leading to irregular menstrual cycles (anovulatory cycles) and decreasing fertility. Obesity in PCOS women amplifies hormonal and metabolic decline, therefore decreasing fertility and oocyte quality in women. In obese women, there is an increased level of insulin circulating the body because of the inability of the body to respond to insulin (insulin resistance). Increased insulin in the blood stimulates the ovaries to produce more androgens increasing the risk of hyperandrogenism that can interfere with the HPO Axis and result with the pathway mentioned previously. In addition, pregnant women with a history of insulin resistance caused by PCOS have an increased risk of gestational diabetes. Obese women tend to have increased abdominal fat deposits, which is correlated with reduced menstrual frequency and fertility and increased insulin resistance. PCOS and obesity can have an affect on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes. Some studies reported women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment tend to have smaller oocytes that can decrease their chances of a successful conception. Some studies have further indicated that even if conception is successful through ART, there is still an increase in miscarriage rates. Currently, therapy is aimed at improving insulin resistance so that hyperinsulinemia is reduced and ovulatory features in women are improved. According to recent studies, insulin-sensitiser drugs are the main type of therapy for women with irregular cycles that want to improve their fertility, although weight loss is normally the first step in overweight women with PCOS. = Stigma = Apart from biological factors, social factors, such a stigma in health care environments, can limit care and desirable health outcomes. In health care settings, overweight and obese women experience weight-related stigma. Surveys have demonstrated that health care workers view overweight and obese individuals as more lazy, less intelligent, and more self-indulgent than individuals with smaller body sizes. These attitudes may limit overweight and obese women's ability to receive high-quality care or limit their desire to become connected to care due to disrespectful treatment by providers. This stigma and reluctance to provide high quality care has been suggested to exacerbate problems of infertility in those who are overweight or obese. Due to the perceived biological associations between excess body fat and infertility, overweight and obese women's inability to conceive can be pre- judged by health care providers. Women who are overweight and obese report that their infertility is attributed solely to their excess body weight and that providers may be unwilling to treat infertility in women who are overweight and obese until they lose weight. Of note, no formal guidelines exist from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine or the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology that dictate when women should receive fertility treatment based on weight. It has also been shown that obese women have higher rates of mood disorders compared to non-obese women. Rates of mood disorders are even higher among women who are treated via in vitro fertilization (IVF) and increase further upon IVF failure. Mood disorders, as well as medications used to treat mood disorders, can exacerbate hormonal and menstrual dysfunction, worsening outcomes of infertility management.  Men  256x256px Numerous studies show the association between obesity in men and infertility. In the developed world, the temporal trend for the reduction in sperm parameters (sperm count, motility, morphology, volume, fructose level, and pH) reflects the increasing prevalence of obesity. The reproductive potential of men who are obese can be attributed to changes in hormone levels which regulate spermatogenesis, increased temperatures in the testicles, the accumulation of environmental toxins in adipose tissue, and increased levels of oxidative stress as well as a higher incidence of erectile dysfunction. = Changes in Hormonal Levels = In males, the accumulation of fatty tissue is linked to a decrease in free testosterone in the serum, which has been proposed to lead to low sperm count. Obese men have lower circulating testosterone which affects sperm production known as spermatogenesis. This affects the quantity and quality of a man's sperm. Obese men have increased risk of oligozoospemia, having fewer than 15 million sperm per millilitre of semen, and far fewer motile sperm than men of lower weight. Sperm with high amounts of damaged DNA are significantly more common in obese men than in normal weight men. Ejaculate volume is also affected. Altered male hormones can also lead to erectile dysfunction which is the major cause of infertility in obese men. = Increased Temperatures in Testicles = Gonadal heat can rise with an increase in fat or adipose tissue in the scrotum. Spermatogenesis is a temperature-sensitive process with the optimal temperature for sperm production in humans ranging between 34‚Äì35 ¬∞C. Thus, obesity may contribute to altered production and parameters of sperm due to an increase of heat in the testicles. Sperm cells can be harmed due to elevated temperatures within the scrotum due to the build up of fat tissue. The damage that heat can pose on sperm production are associated with a reduction in sperm motility, an increase in sperm DNA fragmentation, and increased sperm oxidative stress. = Sleep Apnea = Sleep apnea is defined as a sleep disorder consisting of pauses of breathing or shallow and infrequent breathing during sleep. Every pause in breathing can cause hypoxia due to the lack of oxygen the body receives. Sleep apnea is more commonly found in obese people. The mechanism of correlation between sleep apnea and infertility is not clearly defined. Some studies have found that sleep apnea disrupts sleep quality decreasing the pituitary gonadal function and concentration of testosterone in the morning. Other studies report sleep apnea decreases the quality of sex and increases the likelihood of erectile dysfunction. The collection of all of these factors may contribute to the overall decrease in fertility. = Metabolic Syndrome = Metabolic syndrome is a dysfunction of energy utilization and storage. It is diagnosed based on having at least three of the following criteria: high fasting blood glucose levels, high triglyceride levels, low high density cholesterol (HDL) levels, high blood pressure, and abdominal obesity. Metabolic syndrome has been associated with harmful effects with fertility. People with metabolic syndrome can have high insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia) and high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia ) decreasing sperm quantity and quality, which can increase infertility. = Environmental Toxins = Since adipose tissue is a potential site of toxin accumulation, it is important to view the impacts that environmental toxins pose on fertility. Research demonstrates that metals and chemicals present in air, water, food, and health/beauty products are associated with a reduction in fertility and have potential to cause infertility in males via decreasing sperm count and function. Men who consumed fruits and vegetables with high levels of pesticide residues had a lower total sperm count as well as a lower percentage of morphologically normal sperm. Moreover, a United States study which enrolled 501 participants found a significant association between infertility and blood lead levels in men. Tobacco use in the form of cigarette smoking, another common cause of toxin exposure in the air, has shown to decrease male fertility resulting in a decrease in sperm parameters such as sperm density, total sperm count, and number of motile sperm.  Management  = Female = Preventing or treating obesity in women has a positive effect on fertility rates. As simple as modifying lifestyle choices in order to lose weight could lead to a recovery in fertility decline. Taken into consideration firstly must be the weight of the individual before investigating further into complications surrounding fertility. Initially, treatment should proceed for obesity, then if complications still arise with infertility then progression onto ART is required. There are many other ways of reducing body fat including modifying diet or administrating diet pills, increasing energy expenditure, or surgically removing abdominal fat/surgical fitting of a gastric band in order to subside excess abdominal weight. Restoration of fertility should follow these modifications. A weight-loss study was carried out of 13 individuals over a 6-month period. 12 of the 13 previously infertile subjects restored ovulation whilst 11 subjects were able to conceive after the programme had ended. This study demonstrates weight loss to be the primary source of treatment for obesity and fertility problems before ART. A further study enhances this idea with 80% of females having regular menstrual cycles and conception rate was 29% after modifications.  Women with PCOS  Management for obese women with PCOS follows a relatively step-wise approach, but can be individualized based on the person and their unique needs. Weight loss is normally the first option for overweight women with PCOS. Multiple studies have illustrated the marked improvement in endocrine profile, menstrual cycle, rate of ovulation, and likelihood of healthy pregnancy amongst women who have lost weight. The amount of weight lost does not need to be drastic in order for women to reap the aforementioned benefits; indeed, with even only a 5% decrease in total body weight can lead to increased insulin-sensitivity and ovulation restoration. Thus, for overweight women with anovulation and PCOS, lifestyle modifications are important, and are very often an integral part of the treatment plan to relieve PCOS symptoms. These lifestyle modifications may include increased exercise and a diverse diet composed of fruits, vegetables, low-fat products, and lean meats. Following weight loss are insulin-sensitizing drugs. This class of drugs is the main therapy for women who experience irregular cycles, and want to improve their fertility. One example of an insulin-sensitizing drug is Metformin, which works by inhibiting the liver‚Äôs production of glucose. The decrease in available glucose leads to less insulin secretion, and thereby increases insulin-sensitivity in cells. A systematic review of Metformin illustrated that it benefits women with PCOS in a myriad of ways: decreasing body insulin concentrations, lowering androgen levels, aiding in ovulation, and increasing positive reproductive outcomes. Even for women looking to utilize medications, weight loss should be encouraged to increase the likelihood of ovulation and ovarian response. In the United Kingdom, weight loss is advised for overweight women with PCOS, preferably to a body mass index of less than 30, before initiating drugs for ovarian stimulation. Another study on Metformin is more lenient, and suggests that women with obesity and PCOS should defer treatment with Metformin until achieving a body mass index of 35 or less. Treatment monitoring is more difficult in obese women because the ovaries become more difficult to see on ultrasound scans, potentially leading to oversight of multiple ovulations and pregnancies. Additionally, drugs like Metformin may be less effective in women with anovulation and extreme obesity, although this situation may simply justify a higher dose to be efficacious. Bariatric surgery - procedures that target the stomach and intestines for weight loss - is another option for obese women with PCOS. A small study of 17 women with PCOS revealed that a vast majority improved upon undergoing either biliopancreatic diversion or laparoscopic bypass. Additionally, other metabolic parameters - including insulin sensitivity and blood pressure - also improved in these women. = Male = Obesity in males leads to negative repercussions in fertility, sperm function, and overall health of the offspring. Fortunately, the effects of obesity on male fertility can be reversed, with either weight loss or testosterone therapy. Losing weight has been shown to yield numerous beneficial results; doing so can alter misaligned BMI statuses, and can correct metabolic disturbances associated with increased weight, ultimately decreasing the amount of oxidative stress and DNA damage. There is currently limited evidence for the effect of weight loss on semen- associated factors. Weight loss can be achieved through lifestyle modifications, which include options like a reduced caloric diet, regular exercise, and quitting smoking. In a randomized control trial of obese men, it was observed that increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake led to improvement in erectile dysfunction. Bariatric surgery is another option to improve sexual function in overweight men. In a randomized trial, bariatric surgery reduced BMI significantly more than lifestyle modifications, and ultimately led to a reversal in both erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism. Testosterone therapy may improve hormone imbalances and treat erectile dysfunction. While nearly two-thirds of urologists indicated that they used empirical testosterone therapy for idiopathic male infertility, the efficacy of these agents remains controversial, with particular concerns about the cardiovascular safety profile. Aromatase inhibitors - such as Letrozole - can be used in place of testosterone to overcome reduced testosterone levels commonly found in obese men. However, aromatase inhibitors are not without their own risks as well; there are concerns surrounding long-term aromatase inhibitor therapy due to its effect on bone health.  Animals  = Cattle = It is common practise for body condition scoring to be used in domesticated animals to assess the fatness of an animal and is often used by vets and livestock handlers to determine whether the animal need more or less energy. Both a low and a high score can reduce an animal's fertility. Cattle that are over-conditioned are also more insulin resistant compared to their leaner counterparts. As demonstrated in mice, insulin resistance is a factor in poor fertility as it has an effect on oocyte development. This in turn means that less oocytes are suitable for fertilisation and fertility is impaired. Another reason for decrease in fertility is to do with leptin. Leptin is a hormone which production is increased in obese animals. In cows, leptin can inhibit thecal cells from producing adrostenediol and progesterone. Androstenediol is important in fertility as it is the precursor to oestrogen. Without oestrogen production, the balance of hormones is affected and there is no LH surge which is required for ovulation. = Domestic Fowl = Domestic fowl has previously been researched on and it was found that by over feeding but not force feeding the male birds, there was no effect on fertility. However, more recently a study has shown that obesity induced by force feeding can affect the number of spermatozoa and their motility in the male birds. It was also found that in two of the three birds, there was an decrease in testosterone and an increase in LH which suggests the pathway of why there might be reduced spermatozoa.

Instead, they continue dividing into other spermatogonia or remain dormant to maintain a reserve of spermatogonia. Type B spermatogonia, on the other hand, differentiate into spermatocytes, which in turn undergo meiosis to eventually form mature sperm cells.  Spermatogonial stem cells in the testis  During foetal development, gonocytes develop from primordial germ cells and following this SSCs develop from gonocytes in the testis. SSCs are the early precursor for spermatozoa and are responsible for the continuation of spermatogenesis in adult mammals. The stem cells are capable of dividing into more SSCs which is vital for maintaining the stem cell pool. Alternatively, they go on to differentiate into spermatocytes, spermatids and finally spermatozoa. One SSC is the precursor for multiple spermatozoa and therefore SSCs are much less numerous in the testes than cells undergoing spermatogenesis. = Nomenclature =  In humans  Undifferentiated spermatogonia can be split into 2 groups; A Dark (Ad) and A Pale (Ap) Ad spermatogonia are reserve stem cells. These cells are capable of dividing to produce more SSCs but usually do not. Ap spermatogonia are actively dividing to maintain the stem cell pool. B1-B4 spermatogonia encompass the differentiating spermatogonia and are no longer considered to be stem cells. Most research into SSCs has been carried out in rodents. The subtypes of spermatogonia differ between mice and humans.  In mice  A Single (As) spermatogonia are capable of creating 2 separate daughter SSCs when they divide or the daughter cells can join and form A Paired (Apr) spermatogonia. Both As and Apr spermatogonia are undifferentiated. Chains of these cells form and are referred to as A Aligned (Aal). Aal spermatogonia differentiate and thus are no longer classed as stem cells. They go on to divide 6 times eventually forming B type spermatogonia. = SSC Niche = The most important somatic cells that support regulation of SSCs are Sertoli cells. Various other somatic cells in the interstitial tissue support Sertoli cells such as Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells therefore indirectly influencing SSCs and the location of their niche. Spermatogonia stem cells in mammals are found between the basal membrane of the seminiferous tubules and the Sertoli cells. They remain here until the meiotic prophase stage of meiosis. Here the spermatocytes pass through the basal membrane via the sertoli cell barrier. SSCs stay within their niche where they are encouraged to self-renew. When they move past the basal membrane they differentiate due to cell signals.  Paracrine regulation of SSC self-renewal  Self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is regulated by local signals. Around 50% of the SSC population undergo self-renewal to maintain stem cell numbers, and the other 50% become committed progenitor cells that will differentiate into spermatozoa during spermatogenesis. Cells present in the testes express molecules that play key roles in the regulation of SSC self-renewal. In mice, Sertoli cells have been shown to secrete Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) which has a stimulatory effect on stem cell self-renewal. This factor is thought to be expressed in the peritubular cells in human testes. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) is another molecule crucial for the regulation of stem cell renewal and is expressed in Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and germ cells. FGF2 signalling interacts with GDNF to enhance proliferation rate. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) signaling via its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is also involved in regulation of SSC fate decisions.CXCL12 is found in Sertoli cells in the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules in adult mouse testes, and its receptor is expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonial cells. GDNF and FGF2 are both required to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, and the mitogen- activated protein kinase/ERK1 kinase1 (MEK) pathway, which potentiates SSC proliferation and survival. CXCL12, FGF2, and GDNF all communicate via a network to mediate SSC functions.  Differentiation  Spermatogonial stem cells are the precursors to spermatozoa, which are produced through a series of differentiation steps. This is the alternative SSC outcome to self-renewal. SSCs survive within microenvironments, termed niches, which provide extrinsic stimuli that drive stem cell differentiation or self-renewal. The SSC niche is found in the seminiferous epithelium of mammalian testis, and is primarily constituted of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells. There are two primary differentiation stages, the first of which involves the transformation of As (single) spermatogonia into daughter progeny Apr (paired) spermatogonia, which are predestined to differentiate. These can divide further to create Aal (A-aligned) spermatogonia. The second step involves the production of differentiating A1 spermatogonia from Apr or Aal spermatogonia. These A1 spermatogonia undergo a further five divisions to produce A2, A3, A4, intermediate and type B spermatogonia, which can enter meiosis I. It takes around 64 days to produce mature spermatozoa from differentiating SSCs, and 100 million spermatozoa can be produced each day. One of the major known substances driving the differentiation of SSCs, and therefore the production of spermatozoa, is Retinoic Acid (RA). There are theories supporting the hypotheses of both an indirect (via Sertoli cells) or a direct pathway. It is thought that Sertoli cells produce RA through the conversion of circulating retinol to retinal and then finally to RA. Exposure to RA drives cellular differentiation into A1 spermatogonia and is implicated in further meiotic differentiation. As a result of differentiation, the genes required to maintain a SSC state are no longer expressed. Male reproductive function declines with increasing age as indicated by decreased sperm quality and fertility. As rats age, undifferentiated spermatogonial cells undergo numerous changes in gene expression. These changes include upregulation of several genes involved in the DNA damage response. This finding suggests that during aging there is an increase in DNA damage leading to an upregulation of DNA damage response proteins to help repair these damages. Thus it appears that reproductive aging originates in undifferentiated spermatogenic cells.  Isolation and culture  SSCs have the potential to become increasingly clinically relevant in treating sterility (in vitro spermatogenesis) and preserving fertility prior to gonadotoxic treatments. To this aim, SSCs must be reliably isolated from testicular biopsies for the purposes of e.g. expansion and purification. Current protocols include magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on positive SSC cellular markers such as CD90 and FGFR3 in combination with negative markers like CD45. The latter are particularly important in excluding malignant cells from cancer patients‚Äô biopsies. Once isolated, SSC populations are cultured for the purposes of amplification, characterisation, line maintenance and potentially in vitro spermatogenesis or genomic editing. The main challenges to SSC culturing are the interactions between media substances and the epigenetic makeup that underlies pluripotency and can affect future offspring. Short-term in vitro propagation of these cells has been carried out in Stem-Pro 34 media supplemented by growth factors. Long-term culture of human SSCs is not established yet, however one group reports successful proliferation in feeder cell-free media supplied with growth factors and hydrogel.  Transplantation  The first successful SSC transplantation was described in mice in 1994 whereby the procedure restored spermatogenesis fully in an otherwise infertile mouse. These mice were then able to produce viable offspring which opened new exciting doors for future potential therapies in humans. As cancer treatments are not cancer cell-specific and are often gonadotoxic (toxic to the ovaries and the testes), children usually face infertility as a consequence of treatment as there is no established way to preserve their fertility yet, especially in prepubertal boys. Infertility after cancer treatment depends on the type and dosage of treatment but can vary from 17% to 82% of patients. Spermatogonial stem cell therapy (SSCT) has been proposed as a potential method to restore fertility in such cancer survivors who desire to have children later in life. The method has been tested in numerous animal models including non-human primates; Hermann et al. took out and isolated SSCs from prepubertal and adult rhesus macaques before treating them with busulfan (an alkylating agent used in chemotherapy). SSCs were then injected back into the rete testis of the same animal that they were taken from ~10‚Äì12 weeks after treatment; and spermatogenesis was observed in almost all recipients (16/17). However, these SSCs were difficult to detect which is why further analysis of the ability of descendant sperm to fertilise could not be determined. The viability of embryos fertilised by donor sperm after SSC transplantation needs to be evaluated to truly determine the usefulness of this technique. Recently, SSC transplantation has also been proposed as a potential method for conservation of endangered species through xenogeneic transplantation. Roe et al. suggested that the reproductive lifespan of such species could be extended by transplanting their germ cells into a domestic host. In their study, they used the quail as a model for an exotic species and transplanted SSCs into chicken embryos which successfully colonized the gonadal ridge of the host embryo. This allows the isolation of mature sperm later on in development from the host even after the donor has deceased which can be used in future fertilization and potentially more successful conservation.

He is a deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation of the VII convocation from 5 October 2016 year. Since April 2019, he is the first deputy chairman of the State Duma committee on natural resources, property and land relations.  Biography  =Education= Vasily Vlasov was born on June 27, 1995 in Moscow, and grew up in a single parent household. He studied at high school number 1350 in Moscow, including advanced studies in mathematics and physics. Vlasov later studied in the Institute of World Civilizations (Russian: –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –ú–∏—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö –¶–∏–≤–∏–ª–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–π), and at the Institute of Social and Humanities Education at Moscow State Pedagogical University. The Institute of World Civilizations is an accredited college that was established by Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). =Early career= At 16, he began working in the youth organization of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Later, he became the director of the youth organization of the Liberal Democratic Party in Moscow. He was appointed head of the national youth organization of the Liberal Democratic Party, and also held a lead position in the office of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. However, none of these were paid positions, as his financial disclosure revealed no income in 2015. = Deputy of the State Duma Russian Federation = In 2016, Vlasov was elected as a deputy in the State Duma, the lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, while still a university student. After the elections to the State Duma, he resigned as head of the youth organization of the Liberal Democratic Party. He is a representative for the Leningradsky constituency in Moscow. His first day in office was October 5, 2016, at the age of 21 years and 3 months. He is a member of the Committee on Physical Culture, Sports, Tourism and Youth Affairs. In November 2016, Vlasov and fellow LDPR deputy Boris Chernyshov prepared a bill to lower the voting age in Russia from 18 to 16. This has been a policy of the LDPR since 2014, reflecting the popularity of the party among young people. However, the bill was swiftly rejected by the Russian government. Vlasov has also suggested lowering student train fares to encourage domestic tourism, particularly outside the vacation season, and to facilitate youth attendance at cultural and sporting events. Following the rejection of their proposal to lower the voting age, Vlasov and Chernyshov advanced a similar proposal within the LDPR in January, 2017.

Klein's concept of a paper tool has been widely applied, and is seen as marking a foundational change in scientific reasoning and practice in the history of chemistry in the early 19th century. Klein is a senior research scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, Germany. In 2016 she received the HIST Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society. Education Klein completed her Higher State Exam in chemistry and biology in 1979. After studying chemistry and biology at the Free University of Berlin, she taught both subjects at the secondary level from 1980 to 1988. She earned her Ph.D. in philosophy (summa cum laude) from the University of Konstanz in 1993. Her work Verbindung und Affinit√§t: Die Grundlegung der neuzeitlichen Chemie (1994) explored the 18th century meaning of \\"chemical compound\\". She received Habilitation in philosophy from the University of Konstanz in 2000. Career In 1995 Klein became a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science. In 2005, she became a Senior research scholar at the Max Planck Institute. She became an unscheduled professor at the University of Konstanz in 2007, teaching only occasionally. Klein is an associate editor of Studies in History and Philosophy of Science and Historical Studies in the Natural Sciences,. She also serves on the editorial boards of Ambix, Annals of Science, and Hyle. In addition to being named a member of Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher/Leopoldina as of 2008, Ursula Klein also serves on the Human Rights Committee (HRC) of the Leopoldina. Over her career Klein has mentored a number of historians whose work now engages with the broader historical ontology developed in her research on the experimental sciences. This group of scholars includes Carsten Reinhardt at Bielefeld University (former director of the Chemical Heritage Foundation in Philadelphia, USA), Emma Spary at Cambridge University, Maria Rentetzi at the National Technical University of Athens, Jos√© Ram√≥n Bertomeu-S√°nchez at the University of Valencia and Matthew Daniel Eddy at Durham University. Research =Paper tools= Klein's interdisciplinary work draws upon history, philosophy of science, epistemology and semiotics. She is interested in the manipulation of sign systems on paper and their relationships with experimental and classificatory performance in the laboratory sciences. Klein introduced the concept of the paper tool through an examination of Berzelian formulas and their impact on inorganic and organic chemistry. Berzelian formulas were particularly important because they connected a world of signs with the world of laboratory experimentation. They enabled scientists to describe complex materials and reactions in organic chemistry in organized ways, similar to the ways in which chemists had identified and classified inorganic substances. Berzelian formulas offered a graphically suggestible representation of compositional structure that could be manipulated to investigate chemical reactions. In this way, formulas became a \\"material resource\\" for the creation and manipulation of chemical models. These interpretive models of organic reactions were not based on a particular theory but could be applied to a variety of theories. They gave scientists a new tool for the examination of their ideas. Theories could be supported by the manipulation of Berzelian formulas as well as by experiments. In this way, paper tools acted as causal mechanisms and became the precursors of new theories. The idea of paper tools has been adopted since by others and applied to constructs such as periodic tables, Feynman diagrams and the molecular architecture of Linus Pauling, among others. Klein examines paper tools, models and experiments in terms of their impact on scientific reasoning and practice in early-nineteenth-century organic chemistry in her book Experiments, models, paper tools (2003). She is credited with identifying the \\"invisible turning point\\" of a \\"quiet revolution\\" which shifted chemistry's foundation from natural history, medicine and pharmacy to carbon chemistry. =Ontology of materials= Much of Klein's work has focused on the ontology of materials, the notion of substance, and the development of the observational and experimental sciences. She is particularly interested in forms of knowledge, including bodily skills, technical competence, explicit knowledge, connoisseurship, and analytic and theoretical knowledge; and in methods of measurement, data collection, and classification. In Materials in Eighteenth-Century Sciences (2007) Klein and Lef√®vre discuss ways in which eighteenth century chemistry was grounded in a world of materials such as balsams, fats, salts, alloys, plant materials and blood, and practiced in a wide variety of settings including ‚Äúapothecary's shops, foundries, assaying laboratories, arsenals, dye manufactories, distilleries, [and] coffee shops.‚Äù They then focus on a transitional period in eighteenth-century European chemistry, around 1830. At this time, methods of classification of substances changed, from focusing on experiential classification such as chemical composition, provenance, and properties of the substance, to more fundamental levels such as chemical structure and application. The book was praised for its breadth and \\"well-written exposition of an important change in materials science\\". Materials and expertise in early modern Europe (2010) presents a nuanced understanding of the relationships between academic science and industrial technology in the late eighteenth century, examining the work of both artisans and scholars. =Alexander von Humboldt= Klein's most recent publication, Humboldts Preu√üen. Wissenschaft und Technik im Aufbruch (2015), discusses Alexander von Humboldt and his contemporaries in the context of the early development of Prussian science and technology. Other figures discussed include Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, Franz Karl Achard, Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Carl Abraham Gerhard.

Prime contractor was Hughes Aircraft Company Electronics Division which developed the Tiamat with the assistance of the NACA.Rosenberg, Max, \\"The Air Force and the Guided Missile Program, 1944-1950\\", Defense Lion Publications, Newtown, Connecticut, 2012, , page 7.Parsch, Andreas, \\"Directory of U.S. Military Rockets and Missiles, Appendix 1: Early Missiles and Drones, VB Series, 2003. Testing continued into 1946, but the project was cancelled due to ongoing problems in a period of limited development funding as well as the appearance of more promising missile designs. Development The JB designation was introduced by the U.S. Army Air Force in 1943, and covered guided missiles with rocket and/or air-breathing jet (turbojet, pulsejet, ramjet) propulsion. The JB-3, which contractor Hughes called the Tiamat, was a subsonic air-to-air design intended for use against bombers. \\"It was intended to arm the Northrop-built JB-1 Bat bomber.\\"Porter, Donald J., \\"Howard's Whirlybirds: Howard Hughes' Amazing Pioneering Helicopter Exploits\\", Fonthill Media, 2013, (e-book). Development began in January 1944, and the cylindrical vehicle was propelled by a dual-thrust (boost/sustain) solid-fueled rocket motor and had three comparatively large wings with control surfaces for stability and control. The Tiamat used a semi-active radar seeker and the warhead was triggered by a proximity fuze.

A report for Headquarters Air Material Command at Wright Field, Ohio, dated 1 October 1945, states: \\"Wind tunnel tests have been run in the five-foot tunnel at Wright Field and in the Free Flight Tunnel at NACA, Langley Field. Free-flight rocket-propelled model tests are now in progress at NACA, Langley Field. Tests of the first group of four Hughes JB-3's [sic] have been tested at Wendover Field, Utah. The first JB-3 test failed because of premature operation of the camera rescue parachute. The second JB-3 flew approximately a straight line controlled flight into the ground. The third JB-3 tumbled before the motor fired. The fourth had one or two seconds of controlled flight after the accelerating rocket failed to operate. The fifth JB-3 oscillated violently on its mount before release, rolled immediately after release and the rocket motor exploded after 15 seconds of flight. The sixth JB-3 flew in a steady 12¬∞ dive for its entire flight exhibiting fairly good stability. The seventh JB-3 developed a pre-launching oscillation and tumbled upon release. Its rocket motor exploded after 4 seconds. Both the oscillation experienced before launching and the rocket motor failures are expected to be eliminated in the near future. Flight data indicates that control rates in roll and pitch should be decreased. Sufficient tests have not been made to obtain performance data.\\"USAAF, \\"JB-3 Tiamat - Jet Bomb\\", Report X-135461-AA, Headquarters, Air Material Command, Wright Field, Ohio, 1 October 1945, page 1.http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/c800514.pdf The report says of future testing, \\"Tests on the aerodynamic configuration and control characteristics and [sic] to continue at Langley and Wendover. Variations of three and four winged missiles and swept-back wing missiles will be made at Langley. Difficulties in development of the radar seeker are being experienced and at this time a date cannot be set for the test of the JB-3 under seeker control. Tests of ten JB-3's [sic] with Flight Test Assemblies which simulate seeker control will begin approximately 15 January 1946.\\" Of NACA testing, the report states that \\"The dummy and No. 1 instrumented model have been launched. Trouble was experienced in the phase of flight where the launching booster leaves the model due to instability of the booster unit. A new booster unit incorporating a single boosting rocket is now being designed around the Monsanto ACL-1 rocket.\\" The report concludes that \\"The first seven JB-3's [sic] have been tested at Wendover Field, Utah. Three JB-3's [sic] are scheduled for delivery on 8 October 1945. These missiles are auto-pilot controlled and are set to fly a straight line trajectory.

Air Armament Center Office of History Cancellation Testing and development of the JB-3 continued after World War II, but it was found unsatisfactory and in September 1946 the program was terminated. Funding was also a consideration. \\"During Christmas week, known at Wright Field as the black Christmas of 1946, the president ordered a drastic cutback in fiscal year 1947 research and development spending, effective immediately.

Additional tests by Hughes and the Air Force with existing examples continued into 1947. By this time, more promising air-to-air missile projects had been started, notably the AAM-A-1 Firebird and AAM-A-2/F-98/GAR-1 Falcon.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single flower which is sometimes yellowish- green flower with red stripes and sometimes entirely red. Description Caladenia ampla is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide. A single flower (rarely two) is borne on a spike up to high. The dorsal sepal is erect, oblong to lance-shaped, long and about wide. It tapers near the end which terminates in a glandular structure long. The lateral sepals are oblong to lance-shaped, long, wide and end in a gland similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, wide and taper to a point. The labellum is a broad egg-shape, curves forward, long and wide when flattened. The labellum is cream-coloured with red veins and a dark red tip, sometimes entirely red. There are 9 to 12 pairs of calli along the edge of the labellum, decreasing in length towards its front. There are four rows of foot-shaped calli in the centre of the labellum, also smaller towards the tip. Flowering occurs in September and October.C. ampla labelled Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 2006 and given the name Arachnorchis ampla. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia ampla and the change was published in \\"The Victorian Naturalist\\". The specific epithet (ampla) is a Latin word meaning \\"large\\", referring to the unusually broad labellum of this orchid. Distribution and habitat Caladenia ampla is only known from the goldfields region of Victoria where it grows in mallee scrub and woodlands. Conservation This species is classified as \\"Endangered\\" by the Victorian government.

Two males, known as KAR6 (or I0795) and KAR16a (I0797), have been of great interest to scholars as the subject of successful Y-DNA analysis. Both have been found to belong to subclades of Y-DNA Haplogroup T1,http://isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_HapgrpT.html which is rare in modern populations. These ancient specimens' mtDNA haplogroups have been found to be H1* (H1au1b) and H46b. Their autosomal ancestral components also consist of around 70% \\"Western European Hunter- Gatherer\\" (WHG) and 30% \\"Basal Eurasian\\". Both men lived 7500‚Äì6800 BP and belonged to the Linienbandkeramische Kultur (\\"Linear band pottery culture\\"; LBK). Site A comparison of paleolithic European individuals, including the Karsdorf T1a1 individuals (column headed with lime green cell). A comparison of Neanderthal DNA among paleolithic European individuals, including the Karsdorf T1a1 individuals (row beginning with lime green cell). At a site near and similar to Karsdorf, is the 7000-year-old \\"Goseck circle\\", a pagan cult structure in Goseck, Burgenlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt. Located in the valley of Unstrut, Burgenlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, the Karsdorf sits is characterized by alluvial loess. The place itself was settled intensively since the earliest phase of the Linear Pottery culture (LBK) in the region. The settlement area is at least 50 acres in size and nearly 30 houses have been excavated. So-called ‚Äòsettlement burials‚Äô were regularly found in pits in the center of the settlement area, of which individual KAR6/I0795 (feature 170, 5207-5070 calBCE, MAMS 22823) was sampled for this study. The LBK settlement of Karsdorf (Burgenlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt) is located approximately 100 km south of Derenburg and Halberstadt, on the river Unstrut, and was occupied between 5240 and 5000 BC (Behnke, 2007). The reasons why this early Neolithic settlement was abandoned are unclear. The Neolithic buildings (n=24) of three settlement stages are dated to the early and middle LBK (after Meier-Arendt 1966). Except for four graves, all of the 30 burials are associated in groups next to houses in the centre of the settlement, similar to the site of Halberstadt. The individuals are buried in house-flanking pit graves at the western side of the houses and mostly arranged in north-east or north-west orientation. Grave goods are sparse; few graves contained more than one pot or a shell or horn pendant. Associated with every house group we can identify a person with outstanding grave inventory, who may represent a founding generation.Oelze et al. Burials A special feature of the LBK site at Karsdorf is graves associated with particular houses, which can therefore be regarded as settlement burials. Most of the individuals were buried in a flexed position, oriented to the north-east or north-west. Six individuals were inhumed in supine and four in prone position, of which only three showed a fully stretched body. The LBK in Karsdorf is represented by 24 longhouses oriented north-west‚Äìsouth-east. The assemblage is composed of 20 adults (55% males and 35% females), one juvenile (15‚Äì18 years), four as infants of 7‚Äì14 years and six infants of 0‚Äì6 years. The maximum age at death of males ranged between 40 and 59 years and of females 40‚Äì49 years respectively. The oldest individual is a woman with 65‚Äì75 years. In association with the house S and H, women, men, and children were buried together, in some cases even in the same pit. The furnishing of the graves at Karsdorf can be regarded as rather sparse. Only 9 out of 34 burials contained grave goods, such as an axe in a man‚Äôs grave and a shell buried with a woman, imply sex-specific grave furnishings. The large variability and the sparse indications for maternal kinship suggest a dynamic and mobile group of which several members were buried elsewhere and/or which integrated individuals who originated from other communities. These integrated individuals could be mostly females due to the high indications for paternal kinship among the analysed individuals. Isotope analysis According to Sr isotope ratios, there are two distinct groups of individuals in Karsdorf but none of both are specially 'exotic'. So, there is no indication of individuals who grew up in geologically distinct uplands or further north in central Germany. The first group, composed of the majority of the males, could have grown up in households that cultivated plots on calcareous soils, very probably in the Unstrut valley in the near vicinity of the settlement. The second group, composed of most of the females, could grew up in households that predominantly cultivated plots on loess, possibly beyond the landmarks of the Unstrut River or about 80m above the site on the Querfurt plateau 1‚Äì2 km away. Sex-specific tendencies, the combination of the Sr isotope data with the results of previous carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses, and the similarity of the Sr isotope data of the youngest child with the majority of the males may be evaluated as being in agreement with the predominance of patrilocal residential rules. The Karsdorf population diet consisted of plant crops consumption quite similar to other LBK sites but ate slightly higher quantities of animal protein. Despite of this, there is one female individual that could be classified as a vegan because her results show that she fell in the range of those of the domestic and wild fauna from Karsdorf, indicating she might have lived on the similar herbivore diet for unknown reasons. The consumption of unfermented dairy products is unlikely as there is direct palaeogenetic evidence of lactose intolerance for the site Derenburg. Children in these LBK cultures may have been weaned around the age of three and apparently ate the similar diet as adults after weaning. The highest isotopic value for stable isotopes of nitrogen is found in the youngest Karsdorf individual likely due to breastfeeding effects. In the Karsdorf population the highest animal arotein consumption signal is found in a 15‚Äì18 years old individual belonging to mtDNA H. In addition, the lowest Plant Crop consumption signal is found in the youngest Karsdorf individual and secondarily in two out of three 21‚Äì24 years old individuals belonging to mtDNA U5a and H. DNA analysis The two males, KAR6 and KAR 16a, identified as Haplogroup T1 from Karsdorf constitutes 22.2% of all ancient samples between 7500 and 6800 BP in Germany. The remainder belong to other clades: 22.2% are H2 carriers from Derenburg, and the remaining 55.6% are G2a bearers from Halberstadt and Derenburg. In 2015 a published study by Mathieson et al. test several individuals from two Neolithic sites in northwest Anatolia, the results showed that Haplogroup T1a-M70, previously found in LBK sites from Germany, was not present in Barcin nor Mentese Neolithic settlements. This fact together with the absence of the mtDNA lineages carried by both of the T1a individuals from Karsdorf and the occurrence of G2a and the mtDNA lineages carried by all of these G2a individuals, could mean that the Early European Neolithic T1a-M70 had a different migration pattern and, therefore, a different geographical origin. The autosomal data of I0797 showed the lowest frequency of Anatolian Neolithic component and the highest frequency of an unknown ancient human population for any studied LBK individual. This reinforces the hypothesis of a possible different geographical origin for this T1a tribe instead of the Greco-Anatolian origin of other human groups found in the LBK like G2a. By his side, I0795 showed higher autosomal admixture frequencies of surrounding populations like Hunter Gatherer Europeans I2a (West Hunter Gatherers) and Aegean-Anatolian Neolithics G2a and H2. However, I0795 have the highest frequency of shared DNA with Upper Paleolithic Neanderthals from Central Europe found in any Early Neolithic population. Further comparisons show that I0795 has similar frequencies like Oase-1 when compared with Vindija Neanderthals. When I0795 and I0797 are compared to Oase-1, they both share a very high percentage of DNA 34% and 18% respectively and I0795 12% with Ostuni1. This could mean that this T1a1 tribe from Karsdorf was closest to Upper Paleolithic Hunter-Gatherers than to Mesolithic haplogroups.

It was developed in collaboration by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 1970s and early 1980s for use in androgen replacement therapy for male hypogonadism and as a potential male contraceptive. It was first described in 1986. The medication is an androgen ester ‚Äì specifically, the C17Œ≤ buciclate (4-butylcyclohexane-1-carboxylate) ester of testosterone ‚Äì and is a prodrug of testosterone with a very long duration of action when used as a depot via intramuscular injection. Testosterone buciclate is formulated as a microcrystalline aqueous suspension with a defined particle size of at least 75% in the range of 10 to 50 Œºm. A single intramuscular injection of testosterone buciclate has been found to produce physiological levels of testosterone within the normal range in hypogonadal men for 3 to 4 months. The elimination half-life and mean residence time (average amount of time a single molecule of drug stays in the body) of testosterone buciclate were found to be 29.5 days and 60.0 days, respectively, whereas those of testosterone enanthate in castor oil were only 4.5 days and 8.5 days. Testosterone buciclate also lasts longer than testosterone undecanoate, which has elimination half-lives and mean residence times of 20.9 days and 34.9 days in tea seed oil and 33.9 days and 36.0 days in castor oil, respectively. In addition, there is a spike in testosterone levels with testosterone enanthate and testosterone undecanoate that is not seen with testosterone buciclate, with which levels stay highly uniform and decrease very gradually and progressively. Testosterone buciclate can maintain testosterone levels in the normal male range for up to 20 weeks with a single intramuscular injection. Testosterone buciclate is able to reversibly and completely suppress spermatogenesis in men when used at sufficiently high dosages. As such, the results of clinical studies for use of testosterone buciclate as a male contraceptive were promising, and trials continued as late as 1995, but progress ultimately came to a standstill because the WHO was unable to find an industry partner willing to continue the development of the drug. Because of this, the WHO backed away from testosterone buciclate and focused its research instead on testosterone undecanoate, which is also very long-lasting and has the advantage of having already been marketed and approved for medical use.

He participated in \\"The economic reconstruction of the province of Ferrara\\" project, signed together with the same Balbo and Vittorio Cini and served as Federal Secretary of the city. Oversaw the organization of Ala Littoria S.A., the first Italian flag airline with public capital, the result of the merger of six private companies. Elected deputy in 1934 for the XXIX Legislature Klinger intervened on civil aviation issues, in particular on the delays in the organization of a trans-Atlantic link recommended by Balbo before taking up the post of Governor of Libya. In the position of president and chief executive he oversaw the expansion of his air company Mediterranean and Northern European networks and the implementation of regular trade links between the mother country and the colonies in the Horn of Africa and the African continent in general. In 1938, along with the commander Carlo Tonini, he made a Cant Z.506 double crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in view of the launch of regular lines with Latin America. As part of the project sent experts to Salt Island, in the archipelago of Cape Verde, to study the possibility of installing an intermediate stop, and Buenos Aires to check the convenience of using the flights of Corporaci√≤n Sul Americana de Servicios Aereos as a link between the hinterland of Argentine and neighboring countries with the Italian Atlantic line. World War II Klinger participated in the Second World War with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel pilot of the reserve, receiving five silver medals, one of which given \\"on the field\\". He realized the first war air link with the Viceroy of Ethiopia, Duke Amedeo of Aosta, in Addis Ababa. With nocturnal flights over deserts and enemy territories, he established air routes for the supply of Italian East Africa, precluded by the closure of the Suez Canal by the Britons. Then followed the command of 114¬∫ Independent Group of Terrestrial Bombers, and the appointment as Chief of Staff of the Special Air Service who had the task of supplying the Italian troops in Tunisia, and the organization of paratroopers special operations. An experienced pilot, Umberto had logged over 4,600 flying hours at the controls of different types of aircraft, of which 940 hours in wartime. 2nd Post-war period After the end of WWII, Klinger accepted the invitation by the Municipal Administration of Venice and of the new Italian Government to buy out and rebuild the Aeronautical Workshops of Venice Lido, yet belonged to Ala Littoria, destroyed by the retreating Germans. Engaging its scarce resources, along with his brother's Luigi, he founded the Officine Aeronavali di Venezia. Its customers became main Italian and foreign companies, public and private ones, attracted by the ability of the Workshops in restructuring and overhauling of large aircraft. At the same time Umberto organized the activities of four air companies: the Egyptian S.A.I.D.E., the Lebanese LIA, the Italians Aeralpi for interregional transport and Societ√† Aerea Mediterranea for charter transports and for the development of popular aerial tourism. Major American companies settled relations with the venetian enterprise. The great aviator Chalmers Goodlin, interested in the trade of aircraft, settled for many years at the Lido with Klinger establishing an effective collaboration. In the late 1960s, unfortunately, the persistent shortfall in payments by especially public institutions determined a financial crisis for the company resulting in the inability to meet its obligations to its employees. Exhausted attempts to obtain timely settlement of claims, Klinger committed suicide on January 26, 1971. The day before he had gone to Rome to obtain payment of his outstanding claims as unable to pay the salaries of about 500 Aeronavali workers whom in the meantime had gone on strike.http://legislature.camera.it/frameset.asp?content=%2Faltre%5Fsezionism%2F9801%2F9809%2Fdocumentotesto%2Easp%3F Stenografici dell'Assemblea.

The farm property, now just , consists of rolling fields arrayed on three sides of the farm complex. Included in that complex are a farmhouse, two barns, and several smaller outbuildings. The farmhouse, set close to the road but screened by a dense growth of hedge-like trees, is a 1-1/2 story brick Cape style structure, five bays wide and three deep, with a side gable roof. It has Greek Revival window treatments, and a Greek Revival door topped by a Federal style frieze and flanked by sidelight windows. The interior retains a similar combination of original woodwork. To the house's northwest are two barns of 19th-century construction, one of which may be older than the house. with The farm property is part of land acquired around the turn of the 19th century by Jesse Martin, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. The brick house was built in 1827 by his son Allen, and has remained since then in the hands of his descendants. A wing of the house, of log construction, may have been built by Jesse Martin; it was known in the family as Allen's Cottage, and was where Jesse Martin lived the last few years of his life. Allen Martin's grandnephew, Willard S. Martin, Jr., was a successful businessman who developed the opulent Greatwood estate on land west of the farmstead; it is now the Goddard College Greatwood Campus.

The tour After a drawn match against Indian Universities in Madras, the Ceylon team played India in Bangalore. The strong Indian team won easily: batting first, they scored 508 for 4 (centuries to Dilip Sardesai and Hanumant Singh) before declaring and dismissing Ceylon for 205 and 257, B. S. Chandrasekhar taking five wickets in each innings. The second unofficial Test followed in Hyderabad a few days later and resulted in another clear win for India. India declared at 505 for 6 (centuries to M. L. Jaisimha and Chandu Borde), dismissed Ceylon for 280 and 378, then scored 154 for 3 (a century to Farokh Engineer) to win by seven wickets. Stanley Jayasinghe, who had scored 20 and 63 (top score) in the first match, top-scored in each innings with 78 and 135 in this second match, and Michael Tissera scored 26 and 122. Ceylon then drew against Maharashtra, and lost by nine wickets in Baroda to an inexperienced Indian Board President's XI which included only one Test player. For the third match in the series in Ahmedabad, India made six changes, creating a much younger team. The first day was washed out, and play did not begin until late on the second day. The pitch remained damp throughout the match. On the third day India were dismissed for 189, Jayasinghe taking 6 for 38 and Norton Fredrick 4 for 85. During the innings a ball struck Ceylon's opening batsman Trevelyan Edward, fielding in slips, over the eye, breaking his spectacles and necessitating several stitches in the wound. He could play no further part in the game, so Ceylon batted in both innings with only ten men available. At stumps on the third day Ceylon were 144 for seven. Sensing that dew would make the pitch difficult for batting on the final morning, Tissera declared at the overnight score, 45 runs in arrears, and Fredrick, Jayasinghe and Anurudda Polonowita each took three wickets in dismissing India for 66 in 26.4 overs. Ceylon reached their target of 112 in 55.2 overs, Tissera hitting the winning runs. The remaining two matches, against Bombay and Madras, were drawn. Leading players In the three matches against India, Jayasinghe was Ceylon's outstanding player, making 318 runs at an average of 53.00, and taking nine wickets at 16.33. Tissera was the next most successful batsman, with 249 runs at 49.80, and Fredrick the next most successful bowler, with eight wickets at 27.87.

Like methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone is the parent compound of many AAS. Derivatives of ethyltestosterone include norethandrolone (ethylnandrolone, ethylestrenolone), ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), norboletone, ethyldienolone, tetrahydrogestrinone, bolenol (ethylnorandrostenol), and propetandrol. Ethyltestosterone is described as a very weak AAS and is considerably weaker as an AAS than is methyltestosterone. It is reported to have 1/10th of the anabolic potency and 1/20th of the androgenic potency of testosterone propionate in rodents. Ethyltestosterone was also inactive in boys with dwarfism at 20 to 40 mg/day orally. The low potency of ethyltestosterone is in notable contrast to norethandrolone (17Œ±-ethyl-19-nortestosterone), the C19 nor analogue. Analogues of ethyltestosterone with longer C17Œ± chains such as propyltestosterone (topterone) have further reduced androgenic activity or even antiandrogenic activity. In contrast to ethyltestosterone, its 19-demethyl variant, norethandrolone, is a potent AAS comparable in anabolic activity to testosterone propionate.

History  Greenside Tunnel was built when the branch line from Stanningley to Pudsey Greenside was extended towards Laisterdyke, resulting in the line known as Pudsey Loop. The tunnel was opened in 1893. Since the railway line closed on 15 July 1964, it has been out of use and has been fenced off. Around 2006, planning permission had been granted to fill in the tunnel and the adjoining cuttings, but work has not started yet. Partial landfill has begun as of spring 2018. An application has been made to Leeds city council for complete full landfill as of October 2018  Description  The tunnel is located west of the site of Pudsey Greenside railway station and of the bridge leading Carlisle Road across the former line, and east of a bridge of Smalewell Quarry track, beneath the Fox and Grapes public house. It is long, according to some sources , and led a double-tracked railway beneath a hill on the western side of Pudsey town. The tunnel has not been built in a straight line, but with a slight S-shaped curvature that nevertheless allows to keep at least one entrance in sight at any point of its route. A ventilation shaft had been built about from its western portal. Its opening was located near today's junction of Westroyd, Windmill Hill, and Smalewell Road, beneath an access road to some garages, but is now capped off. The eastern portal is located below steep retaining walls on the south side of the approach cutting. Since closure of the line, it has been partly blocked by tipped spoil. The lining consists of masonry side walls with a height of about , the roof arch has been constructed from engineering brick. Throughout the tunnel, amply-sized refuges in brick have been provided at regular intervals. The western portal is built from stone with buttresses and wing walls to each side.

She was designed in France by VPLP and Guillaume Verdier and built in the United States by Hodgdon Yachts for Dr. James H. Clark and christened as Comanche. Comanche holds the 24-hour sailing record for monohullsWSSR 253 covering 618 nmi in the 24 hours (averaging ). Comanche won line honours in the 2015 Fastnet race and the 2015 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. Comanches skipper was Ken Read. In 2017, Comanche set a 24-hour run of 484.1 nmi, a new Transpac record, with an average speed of . Comanche won 2019 2225-mile 50th Trans-Pacific Yacht race with navigator Stan Honey, time 5 days 11 hours 14 minutes 05 seconds. Additionally, the Comanche holds the Monohull Transatlantic sailing record for the fastest time of crossing the Atlantic Ocean, which they beat on the 28th of July, 2016. The current record is a time of 5 days, 14 hours, 21 minutes 25 second. In December 2017, Comanche was sold to Australian Jim Cooney. Comanche holds the fastest time for the Sydney to Hobart yacht race after winning the Sydney to Hobart 2017 in 1 day 9 hours 15 minutes 24 seconds. Comanche was renamed to LDV Comanche when Jim Cooney purchased the yacht, due to a one-time sponsorship from SAIC Maxus Automotive Co's LDV brand. The yacht later returned to its original, unsponsored title of Comanche. Under this name it won the Sydney-Hobart race again in 2019 in 1 day 18 hours and 30 minutes. Soon after the completion of the 2019 Sydney-Hobart race, Comanche was reportedly sold to a Russian interest group. Details of the sale have not been disclosed as of yet.

Although it easily pushes low density gas and dust clouds, it can not easily push high density clouds. As the cosmic winds start to push the clouds, they start to separate and start looking like taffy being pulled apart. It has a primary composition of photons ejected from large stars and sometimes thermal energy from exploding stars. It can be caused by orbital motion of gas in the cluster of a galaxy, or can be ejected from a black hole. Because new stars and planets form from gases, the cosmic winds that push the gases away are preventing new stars from forming. Observation The presence of Cosmic wind in the vicinity of a black hole can be noted through the meticulous inspection of absorption line features in the spectra of the accretion disk surrounding said black hole. These features are commonly seen through X-ray telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, NuSTAR, and NICER. The investigation of the origin and regulating mechanisms of the wind is an active research topic.

It was released as part of a six-song EP in November 2004, and was also featured on her 2005 album Wikked Lil' Grrrls. The song lyrically explores the lack of originality in current popular music, decrying several popular performers, including Ashanti and Britney Spears. Upon its release, the song received almost unanimous praise from critics, who compared Esthero's vocal performance to Bjork's and praised the track's outspokenness and production. An accompanying music video was shot in Toronto and released, receiving play on MuchMusic. To promote the song, an EP of the same name was released by Reprise Records in November 2004. It featured collaborations with Sean Lennon and Cee-Lo and garnered unanimous praise from critics, who praised the release's eclecticism and regarded the title track as a highlight. Background and writing Esthero had been dropped from Work Group Records in 1999, when it was absorbed into Epic Records. She subsequently signed with Reprise Records and worked on a number of collaborations and soundtrack contributions before commencing recording for her second album in the early 2000s. Due to a series of delays, \\"We R In Need of a Musical Revolution\\" wasn't released until late 2005, making some of the lyrics sound dated. In an interview with The Washington Post, she stated that \\"When I wrote it, the Ashanti comment (\\"No matter where I go, I see Ashanti on the video screen\\") was relevant,\\" but that \\"by the time we mixed (the song), I was secretly hoping she would resurface with something so that my statement would be relevant!\\" Ashanti returned to the spotlight as a spokeswoman for Herbal Essence, and Esthero admits that \\"Secretly I was going, 'Yes, now my song makes sense!'\\" Esthero told Billboard that she chose to have the song as the opening track on Wikked Lil' Grrrls because it \\"made everything make sense. I felt that if I make it the first track on the record , people would understand why I do so much genre-hopping, and why the album is so manic. It just puts a nice little bow on the record.\\" Composition Lyrically, the song explores the lack of originality in current popular music. Esthero references a number of musicians and pop-culture events in the song. Some of these include: * Ashanti (\\"No matter where I go, I see Ashanti in the video\\") * MTV (\\"And MTV they only play the same thing\\") * Britney Spears (\\"No matter where I go, I see Britney on my video screen\\") * R. Kelly (\\"Tell me why a grown man can rape a little girl, but we still hear his shit on our radio\\") Critical reception The song garnered mostly favorable reviews from music critics, with many comparing the song to Bj√∂rk's music. Johnny Loftus, writing for AllMusic, felt that the song was a highlight of both the EP and the album and stated that the song \\"updates the sound of Esthero's 1998 debut with propulsive programming and more Bj√∂rk in her vocal than ever before.\\" Mark Saleski, writing for Blog Critics, was similarly-positive, calling the song \\"sassy\\" and \\"funny\\". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani likewise praised the track, commenting that its lyrics \\"justly lambaste radio for its repetitive playlists and MTV for what they're now calling the 'Big 10.'\\" However, Annie Zaleski, writing for the Cleveland Scene, held the opposite view. She felt that the song was the weakest track on the EP, calling it \\"weak\\" and \\"whiny\\". Music video A music video, directed by Noble Jones, was released, and features Esthero destroying televisions and performing on a busy street. The city and street scenes were shot in Toronto, Ontario. The video was premiered in June 2005, and was aired on MuchMusic. EP A six-track EP of the same name was released by Reprise to promote the song, and in anticipation of her second full-length album, which the label predicted would be released in early 2005. Three of the tracks, including the title track, were later included on her second full-length album, Wikked Lil' Grrrls. =Track listing= #\\"We R in Need of a Musical Revolution!\\" ‚Äì 4:04 #\\"Everyday Is a Holiday with You\\" ‚Äì 4:02 #\\"Gone\\" ‚Äì 5:11 #\\"This Lull-a-bye\\" ‚Äì 5:30 #\\"I Drive Alone\\" ‚Äì 3:40 #\\"Amber & the Tiger's Eye\\" ‚Äì 7:28 (bonus track) =Critical reception= The EP garnered highly positive reviews. AllMusic notes the EP as a career highlight for Esthero. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus awarded the EP three and a half out of five stars, likening Esthero's vocal performance to Bjork's and praising the EP's stylistic range, noting \\"Gone\\" as the EP's best song. Annie Zaleski, writing for Cleveland Scene, was also positive, commenting that the EP demonstrates Esthero's \\"musical growth\\" and noting the album's stylistic eclecticism. She had mixed feelings, however, regarding the title track, and commented that \\"tidying up her once-messy mash-ups produces songs that just aren't very interesting.\\" References External links *Read the full lyrics on MetroLyrics *View the music video on YouTube Category:Esthero songs Category:2004 singles Category:2004 songs Category:2004 EPs Category:Songs about music ","title":"We R in Need of a Musical Revolution"},{"id":"51779360","title":"List of animated feature films awards"},{"id":"51779364","text":"Tenor , baritone Antti Kaleva, Irma Urrila. 1964 Irma Urrila (born 29 January 1943) is a Finnish operatic soprano,Karl-Josef Kutsch, Leo Riemens: Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon.

Osgood was born in Boston in 1849. Early in life, she married Dr. Osgood, a physician of Boston. Her first appearance in public was made in Boston, when she was so successful that she was engaged for two years to sing in Canada and the United States. In 1875, she went to England to study oratorio, and made her debut at The Crystal Palace in the same year, but did not appear again till 1876, when she accompanied Charles Hall√© on a provincial tour, and gained her reputation as a vocalist. In this year, she also won praise as the soprano in Liszt's new oratorio \\"Saint Elizabeth,\\" and at the Crystal Palace, sang frequently selections from Wagner's \\"Tristan und Isolde,\\" and Gounod's classical compositions. In March. 1878, Osgood visited the US, and appeared with acceptance at Theodore Thomas's concerts in New York City, at Cincinnati, and in Canada. She returned to England in the autumn of 1878, sang at the Shakespeare memorial festival at Stratford-upon-Avon in June 1879, and at Christmas, in Liverpool in Sir Arthur Sullivan's \\" Light of the World.\\" In 1880, she appeared at the state concert at Buckingham Palace, and in August of that year, she revisited the US and made a successful tour. Since 1875 she resided principally in England. Biography Emma Aline Osgood was born in Boston, Massachusetts, circa 1852. Her family was eminently musical, and her father had a rich basso voice, while the full toned contralto of her mother was known throughout the New England area close to their home. She began singing here in the choirs at church on Sundays. Her first appearance in public was in Boston, when in 1873, she sang with the Beethoven Quintette Club. Being very successful in her first efforts, the Club engaged her for a tour through Canada, and for two years she sang with the Club in various parts of that country, and in the US. It was not until February, 1875, that she decided to come to England to study oratorio. On her arrival in England, Osgood's whole attention was devoted to the study of oratorio, but it was not until some time later that she made her first success in it. In October, 1875, she made her first appearance at The Crystal Palace, but she did not again appear until early in 1876, when she fulfilled several engagements with Charles Hall√© in the provinces. She sang with success at Manchester, Wolverhampton, Liverpool, Birmingham, and other cities of England. Around 1869, Walter Bache produced at St James's Hall, a new oratorio by Listz, entitled \\"Saint Elizabeth.\\" Madame Titiens took the soprano part. The result was a dismal and complete failure. From that time to 1876, this oratorio was prudently laid on the shelf, but in 1876, Walter Bache decided on giving it one more trial, and he fixed on Osgood for the soprano part. On the night of production, the house was packed with critics, musicians and vocalists, all come to witness another failure. There was no doubt in the minds of the audience that they were about to see a second catastrophe of this ill-fated oratorio. The issue, however, was a success for Osgood. The press were unanimous in their praise, and all predicted a fine career for the young soprano. During this year, Osgood sang often at the Crystal Palace, her favourite selections being motives from Wagner's \\"Tristan und Isolde\\" and other works by the same composer, as also some of Gounod's more classical compositions. She sang at the Brighton Festival in the spring of 1877, with Madame Patey, and Signor Foli, in Verdi's \\"Requiem;\\" and also at Liverpool at the Philharmonic Concert, and later in 1877, where Verdi's \\"Requiem\\" was again given, with Annie Williams in the second soprano part. At Exeter Hall, Osgood sang in most of the principal oratorios, \\"Messiah,\\" \\"Creation,\\" \\"St. Paul,\\" with much success. She also sang for the first time in Boosey's ballad concert, and brought out Sullivan's melodious ballad, and \\"My Dearest Heart\\". In the autumn of this year, she sang for the first time at the Leeds Festival in \\"Samson,\\" \\"The Creation,\\" and in Austin's \\" Fire King.\\" Early in 1878, Cowen's \\"Deluge\\" was given at the Brighton Festival, with Beethoven's \\"Mount of Olives.\\" In both of these oratorios Osgood sang. In March, she went to the US, and sang at the Festival of Cincinnati, and Worcester, and in Canada, twice in oratorio, and also in Theodore Thomas's concerts in New York. Returning to London in the autumn, Osgood sang at Christmas, in Liverpool, in the \\"Messiah,\\" and in many other concerts. In the summer of 1878, she was engaged for the State concert held at Buckingham Palace, but the death of the Queen of the Netherlands caused the concert to be postponed. During 1879, she sang in concerts given by Messrs. Metzler & Chappell of London, in opposition to Boosey's older entertainment, and also in concerts of Lady Lindsay and Mr. Bethune. In March, was produced at Cambridge, Alberto Randegger's \\" Fridolin,\\" which was given with much success. From February to June, she sang many times in concerts and oratorios. The most notable performances were at Kuhe's Festival in February, when Beethoven's \\"Mount of Olives\\" was again given. Osgood sang Randegger's \\"Medea,\\" at St. James's Hall, for the Philharmonic Society. In June was given the Shakespeare Memorial Festival at Stratford- upon-Avon, where she sang, with other things, Bishop's setting to \\"When the Cold Winds Blow.\\" At Christmas, 1879, Osgood again sang at Liverpool in \\"The Light of the World,\\" by Sullivan. During 1880, Osgood sang at Charles Halle's concert at Manchester; at St. James' Hall in the Bach choir concerts; in Joseph Hatton's reading, when she sang Sullivan's \\"My Dearest Heart,\\" and Cowen's setting to \\"The Better Land\\". Up to her second visit to the US in August, 1880, the whole of Osgood's time was occupied; she sang at Mann's concerts, and in the aria, \\"Gliicklein im Thale,\\" and in Weber's \\" Euryanthe\\". At a concert in Exeter Hall, she sang a new song composed expressly for her, entitled \\"Two by Two,\\" by Nicola Ferri, and was encored several times. Osgood made her greatest hit in 1881 at the State concert given at Buckingham Palace on June 2, in an aria from \\"Tristan and Isolde,\\" of Wagner, in a trio with Albani and Patey, and in a quartette from \\"Martha,\\" with Patey, Guyarri, and Lasscalle. Osgood was also chosen to sing a verse from \\"God save the Queen,\\" striking the top B flat with great exactness and effect. It was said that Osgood's voice was perfect throughout its entire range; every note was distinct, full, and rich. But her especial feature was the depth of ringing tone of her lower notes, which gave her great advantage over other oratorio sopranos. Osgood also excelled in ballad music, in which she was very successful. She died in 1911 in Philadelphia.

He is a former director of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, National Academy of Sciences, India, and Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1981, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  Sushil Kumar, born on 14 December 1940 in the Indian capital of Delhi, did his schooling at Municipal Primary School and Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Public School, both Delhi-based schools, and graduated in science from Hansraj College, Delhi in 1960. He joined the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) for his post graduate studies from where he obtained his master's degree (MSc) in 1962 under the guidance of S. Ramanujam and continued his research there, mentored by A. T. Natarajan, to secure a doctoral degree (PhD) in 1965. He did his post-doctoral research under M. S. Swaminathan, the pioneer of Indian Green Revolution, during 1965‚Äì66 and continued his research in the US at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory with Paul Margolin from 1966 to 1968, at University of Wisconsin-Madison with Wac≈Çaw Szybalski from 1968 to 1970 and at University of Toronto with C. R. Fuerst from 1970 to 1971. Returning to India in 1971, Kumar joined the Indian Agricultural Research Institute as a geneticist and senior scientist where he served till 1989, serving as the professor of Molecular biology and Agricultural biotechnology from 1985 onward. Moving to the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) as a senior grade scientist in 1989, he became the director of the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants in 1993, superannuating in that position in 2000. During his tenure at CSIR, he also held the directorship of two subsidiaries, the Human Resource Development Group in 1997 and the National Botanical Research Institute during 1998‚Äì99. Post his official retirement, he continued his association with CSIR as an emeritus scientist from 2001 to 2005 when he moved to the National Institute for Plant Genome Research, an autonomous institute under the Department of Biotechnology as an INSA Senior Scientist in 2006, holding the position till 2010. He has been associated with the SKA Institution for Research, Education and Development since 2012 where he continues his researches.  Legacy  Escherichia Coli The researches of Sushil Kumar which focused on the fields of plant and microbial genetical genomics are reported to have assisted in a wider understanding of biotechnology and crop breeding. His early researches helped in the discovery of structural arrangement of chromosomes in the interphase nucleus and later, working on Escherichia coli and its bacteriophage Lambda, he described its transcription map. He elucidated the pleiotropic functions of cyclic AMP in Escherichia coli and elaborated on the antitermination and antiparallel transcription and transcription termination sites of Lambda phage. He is known to have discovered new genes in Rhizobium, a nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria and developed its mutants which has higher nitrogen fixing capabilities, thus contributing to augmenting the cultivation of crops such as Pisum sativum (Pea), Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) and Triticum aestivum (Wheat). His work also helped in the genetic improvement which yielded higher levels of artemisinin in Artemisia annua (Sweet wormwood) and essential oil in Mentha arvensis (Wild mint). His researches have been documented by way of over 300 articles and 25 books and he has received 80 international and 52 Indian patents for his work. In 1971, Kumar founded the molecular genetics laboratory of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute and later, contributed to the introduction of an academic course in molecular genetics at the institute. During his tenure at the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, he established a regional field station of the institute at Uttaranchal and founded a central Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Laboratory. A former president of the Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding (1994‚Äì97), he started the Journal of Medicinal and Aromatic Plant Sciences during his tenure as the president. He was associated with several other science journals such as Journal of Genetics, Indian Journal of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Indian Journal of Experimental Biology and Proceedings of Indian National Science Academy and mentored 32 doctoral scholars in their researches.  Awards and honors  Sushil Kumar received the Gold Medal from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in 1962 and the Genetics Medal of the Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding in 1965.

Johnson is the current chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The bill was placed on the Senate legislative calendar and is currently awaiting further action. Johnson wrote the bill in response to the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense's findings on the state of US preparedness for biological disaster, either as a result of terrorist activity, inadvertent release of hazardous pathogens or a disease pandemic. In October 2015 the panel found the government's preparation for biodefense lacking in that it was fragmented across a multiplicity of federal agencies, among other problems. The bipartisan panel, with members such as former senators Joe Lieberman (I-Connecticut) and Tom Daschle (D‚ÄìSouth Dakota) was organized by the first Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. Lieberman and Ridge concluded that biological threats are \\"‚Ä¶among the most sinister ‚Äì and potentially catastrophic ‚Äì our nation faces.\\" They emphasized the need for Congress and the Executive to pay attention to these potential disasters and formulate a plan to defend all Americans. Johnson's bill currently lingers in the Senate, after being reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  Background  United States Airman wearing an M-17 nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare mask and hood There are many threats from biological weapons including biological terror attacks against the population. The threat is not limited only to terrorism. Dangerous pathogens can be released accidentally from research laboratories and outbreaks of certain infectious diseases can wreak biological havoc. Cases of pathogen releases included the breakout of burkholderia pseudomallei bacterium at Tulane University's National Primate Research Center where many of the lab's primates were infected, as well as a visiting scientist from the US Department of Agriculture. Teams of investigators from the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Agriculture, along with National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health investigated the matter. The US Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah sent live anthrax spores to laboratories in nine states and an army facility in South Korea. Anthrax are very infectious bacteria that infect people by moving through the air. The CDC conducted a thorough investigation and, although no one developed the disease, more than 40 workers at the labs were treated. Examples of disease outbreaks include major international recent events including the Ebola virus, avian influenza and now the Zika virus. The National Biodefense Strategy Act had its origins in a panel called the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense. The bipartisan panel was led by former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman, appointed by U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. In 2015 the panel released a national blueprint for biodefense which included a long list of recommendations on improving the defense against and preparation for responding to a biological incident. According to panel member and former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle (D-South Dakota) the most important flaw in biodefense was the need for a permanent leadership organization in the White House. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, the aggregate of government agencies involved demonstrated a coordinated response mechanism is essential. Daschle agreed with the Panel's recommendation that the responsibility for biodefense coordination should be that of the Vice President. The panel concluded that the US biodefense has become too fragmented with authority spread among too many government agencies. They said Congress could repair these flaws by focusing the command and control of biodefense at the White House and empowering one individual with the responsibility and budgetary authority to coordinate the diverse and numerous communities that manage the nation's biodefense. After the panel released its blueprint, Johnson began writing the legislation. According to the Senate report accompanying the bill, \\"The purpose of S. 2967, the National Biodefense Strategy Act of 2016, is to require the President to develop and execute a comprehensive national biodefense strategy. In 2014, several high-ranking Government officials‚Ä¶ convened the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense to assess the state of our nation's biodefense capabilities and to recommend improvement measures. S. 2967 codifies key recommendations of this panel by requiring a holistic national strategy that aims to direct and harmonize all existing agency- specific strategies with respect to biodefense.\\" According to Homeland Preparedness News, \\"Among the report's chief findings was the conclusion that the United States lacks a single federal leader for biodefense, a comprehensive national strategy and a dedicated biodefense budget.\\" > The U.S. government spends approximately $6 billion each year on biodefense- > specific activities, but the report highlighted the GAO's finding of a > fragmentation of biodefense leadership. The GAO said that there are more > than two dozen presidentially appointed individuals with biodefense > responsibilities and numerous federal agencies with mission responsibilities > for supporting biodefense activities. No individual or entity, however, has > responsibility for overseeing the nation's biodefense enterprise.  Major provisions  The objective of the bill is to improve coordination within the federal government in order to prevent and prepare for a biological attack. For example, the legislation would create a Biodefense Coordination Council which would include representatives from key federal government agencies. If legislation was signed into law, the President of the United States would be required to report to Congress on the status of the biodefense strategy every 180 days until that strategy was fully implemented. The National Biodefense Strategy Act amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the law that created the U.S. Department of Homeland Security one year after the 9/11 attacks) by directing the President of the United States to:\\"S.2967 - National Biodefense Strategy Act of 2016\\". Congress.gov. (Library of Congress: Washington, D.C.) Retrieved 2016-09-20. * Create, submit, and regularly update a National Biodefense Strategy in order to direct and align efforts by the federal government toward an effective and continuously improving biodefense system. * Create a Biodefense Coordination Council which will provide expertise required to develop the strategy to align various government agencies and their activities into a coordinated biodefense effort. * Report on the total amount of money that federal agencies are spending on bio defense activities annually. The National Biodefense Strategy would serve as a comprehensive guide for U.S. biodefense programs and would include: * A detailed description of every entity and leader responsible for implementing, overseeing, and coordinating federal biodefense activities. * A review of all military and civilian federal government activities regarding biodefense. * A \\"detailed analyses of recommendations issued by external biodefense review commissions, lessons learned from the government response to public health emergencies within the preceding five years, major biological incident risks, resources and capabilities needed to address identified risks, resource and capability gaps in the biodefense enterprise, and prioritization and allocation of investment across the biodefense enterprise.\\" Other provisions can be viewed on the summary page for the legislation at Congress.gov.  Legislative history  U.S. Senator Ron Johnson, chief sponsor of the National Biodefense Strategy Act of 2016 On May 23, 2016, Senator Johnson introduced the bill along with Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who was an original co- sponsor.

Evidence that during Saxon times deer hunting was taking place in this fashion survives in a tract written by a 10th-century monk called √Ülfric who wrote \\"I weave myself nets and set them in a suitable place and urge on my dogs so that they chase the wild animals until they come into the nets unawares and are thus ensnared and I kill them in the nets.\\"Legendary Dartmoor In several Saxon documents 'Deer Parks' are recorded to as 'Derhage' or 'Deer-hay'.

A Glossary of Terms and Definitions. and is also regarded as the etymological root of the word hay. The term haga or hay effectively came to mean a deer park.Legendary Dartmoor The words haga, hage, hege, haia, etc. all relate to the managing of deer.Fletcher, p.57 The Doomsday Book records 31 parks with a few still held by Anglo-Saxons.Farjon, p.188 The 'deer-hays' of Anglo-Saxon times would have been more or less temporary structures although some may have developed into places where deer were kept until such a times as they were needed at which point they would be killed.Farjon, p.188 Imparkment developed from the 12th to the 14th centuries, reaching its peak in the early 1300s at which time around 3,200 parks in England covered up to 2% of the total land area representing about a quarter of the country‚Äôs woodland.Deer Salters in Leagram Park. The word or in Gaelic originally meant 'ambush' and later meant a 'deer trap' described as a funnel-like defile, artificial or natural into which deer were herded so that they could be contained and then killed. The personal or place name 'Elrick' is linked to such deer traps.Jackson, p.52.Taylor, p.51 The Gaelic name Tainchell was the term used for the group of beaters who took part.Fletcher, p.51 The Gaelic word 'eilid' means a hind and this association may explain why the word after linguistic evolution in Wigtownshire to 'eileirg' or ' eileirig' with the meaning of 'deer-trap' and the local place-names 'Eldrig', 'Elrig', 'Elrick', etc. derive from this source and some of the defiles used in the hunt can still be identified.MacQueen, p.128 Structure and function Quillisfield or Coilsfield House. The capture and movement of deer from the wild or from established deer hays or parks was necessary for establishing new ones and for restocking existing ones to replace animals lost via excessive hunting or disease and at times to introduce new breeding stock to maintain vigour in isolated and inbred populations. Deer might also be managed in terms of castrating stags and selectively culling diseased or elderly animals.Fletcher, p. 155 In feudal times the monarch would at times make gifts of live deer to those who were in the royal favour to replenish or establish herds, and a system of capturing deer therefore had to exist.Legendary Dartmoor A section of the Parkmoor Deer Hay trenches at Coilsfield To create a deer park the person had to own the land, purchase a license from the monarch and have sufficient funds to empark the area, constructing pales and ditches, deer leaps or salters, etc. Some parks even had towers from which the deer could be shot with bows and arrows.Legendary Dartmoor Thirty-seven parks or hays are listed in the Domesday Book, and of these nine belonged to the king, five by bishops or monastic houses and twenty three by Norman knights, etc. These hays or parks were isolated in the countryside by physical land divisions such as pales with ditches and served to protect the deer which were to be used for hunting and to help keep out predators whilst also preventing wild deer from eating crops in areas where farming was prevalent.Legendary Dartmoor The term 'fence month' was applied to the time during fawning and to the annual rut time in the autumn during which the deer were not disturbed and this restricted the period when deer hay winds and elricks could be used.Legendary Dartmoor Both wattle fencing and nets may have been employed in the 'wynding of the deer hay' and it was also important that the animals could be separated into small groups to reduce the chance of them goring each other by accident.Fletcher, p.158 A wide entrance that narrowed down on a gently rising slope would also slow their progress when pursued by hounds and places where people could hide,Fletcher, p.157 possibly with hounds until required would be advantageous.Fletcher, p.156 The beaters would also separate the stags from the hinds if required.MacQueen, p.128 Elricks or deer hay winds were a places in Scotland and EnglandMacQueen, p.128 where deer could be channelled and confined in a corral, a practice that ceased to be used in the 18th century although the practice had a brief resurgence in the days of Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria.Fletcher, p.51 Stone lined pits and boulders once heated in fires have been found in association with elricks which may have been used to cook or render the venison from the newly slaughtered animals.Fletcher, p.51 'Burnt Mounds' that are often horseshoe-shaped are known in Ireland as 'fulacht fiadh' and consist of a pit and heaps of shattered stones that have once been strongly heated. These structures are traditionally associated with the cooking of venison in the water filled pit using the heated stones. It has been found that these structures are also present in Scotland such as four sites in South-West Scotland.Murray, Page 42 A deer hunt of this type was recorded in the medieval romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.MacQueen, p.128 The native Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) and later introduced Fallow Deer (Dama dama) are suited for enclosure in deer parks however European Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) are not as they are aggressive towards other deer.Deer Salters in Leagram Park. Fallow Deer were introduced by the Normans from Sicily, probably in the early twelfth century.Deer Salters in Leagram Park. =Examples of Deer Hays and Elricks= The Windy Gill and the Water of Fail Near Parkmill Farm on Parkmoor (NS 4425 2693), Tarbolton in South Ayrshire is a complex system of interlinking deep trenches running down to the Water of Fail that were given the name 'Roman Trenches'.Smith, p.151 The local historian John Smith circa 1895 examined them and also identified what he regarded as an Ancient British Stockade which had been taken following a siege by Roman troops during which the 'Roman Trenches' were built.Smith, p.153 Some of the trenches are still around 9 feet deep and are recorded to have once been much deeper.Smith, p.152 They lie within a few hundred metres from a medieval deer park's boundary.Fletcher, p.157 The Parkmoor 'Roman trenches' In 1428 it is recorded that John Stewart of Darnley near Glasgow held a deer park with a ditch, bank and pale in the Tarbolton area.Gilbert, page 215 Place names such as Parkmoor, Parkmill and Parkhill reflect the existence of a deer park in this area and a park with a building and pale is recorded on the 1654 map of Kyle by the cartographer BlaeuTaylor, p.12 taken from an earlier map by Timothy Pont. Herman Moll's map of 1732 shows at least four deer parks in the vicinity of Parkmoor at Fail Abbey, Park Mill, at Coilsholm Wood and at Barskimming.The South Part of the Shire of Air, containing Kyle and Carrick by H. Moll Once known as 'Quillisfield' the estate was given to the monks of Melrose Abbey by Sir John de Graham of Dunduff, Lord of Tarbolton in the 13th century.'Coilsfield' by Nathaniel Gow After the reformation Coilsfield Castle and Estate was acquired by the Cunninghames of Caprington, it was then sold to the Montgomerie family in 1661. In around 1847 the Coilsfield estate was sold to William Orr who had agreed to become the heir of the architect of the house, John Paterson, on the understanding that he would change his name to Paterson but and also buy the Coilsfield estate, renaming it Montgomerie.Landed Families of Britain and Ireland. The RCAHMS describes these features on the old Coilsfield Estate as an \\"irregular series of artificially-cut ditches run roughly parallel in a SE-NW direction down a gently W-facing and wooded slope at c70m OD. They are closely spaced, mostly V-shaped, and range from 0.5m to 2.0m in depth with little evidence of upcast banking. Some conjoin to form wider channels which fade at the steeper slopes above the water of Fail.\\"RCAHMS Parkmoor 'Roman Trenches' The 'Old Fortifications' at Nuthill. Taylor has associated the local place names of Wyndford and Windy Gill at Parkmoor with an early 16th-century reference to the winding of the hay yard to catch deer at the Nuthill Estate in Fife and has suggested that this made reference to the construction of wattle fencing and nets along the line of the trench banks in preparation for catching deer and that the system of trenches may have been known as a 'wynd'.Taylor, p.13 In Scots language the word 'Wynd' has been used since at least the 13th century to describe frequently winding, narrow streets or alleys which aptly describes the appearance of known deer hay winds and elricksScots Dictionary and wynding would be the creation of narrow alleys or entrances.Fletcher, p.156 At Parkmoor the deer would naturally enter the Windy Gill to drinkFletcher, p.156 and could then be driven by men and hounds towards the deer hay wind. The area that was supposed by John Smith to be an Ancient British Stockade and the area later used as a bowling green may have been involved in the processing of the deer by comparison with the use of elricks.Fletcher, p.51 On the Nuthill Estate in Fife (NO234079) are a system of trenches surveyed by Thomas Winter in 1757 and recorded as 'The Trenches are Old Fortifications' or 'Roman Trenches'. This complex system of trenches and banks are located near the old royal hunting park of Falkland.Taylor, p.12 This feature is considered to have been used to capture deer from the Lomond Hills by corralling them and then taking suitable hinds and stags to the nearby royal hunting park.Taylor, p.13 The Falkland Treasurers Accounts of 1505 refer to a payment of 14 shillings to \\"John Balfour for ranging through the countryside with bloodhounds to drive the deer to the park\\" and for the \\"winding of the hay yard to catch them\\".Taylor, p.14 Fields or enclosures called ‚ÄòDeerends‚Äô are recorded just to the west of the site.Living Lomonds Landscape Project The Glen of the Bar elrick At Nuthill at least seven trenches can still be discerned with a present-day depth of up to 2 metres and a length of 150 to 200 metres. Some are cut through the bedrock and they curve towards each other towards the west at the bottom of a slope that joins a water course. The glen or gill then acts as a natural channel that runs towards the old Falkland Deer Park and the Lomond Hills lie above.Fletcher, p.157 A number of place names suggest the past use of the site such as 'Deerends', 'Greyhound Den' and 'Burn of Deer'.Fletcher, p.157 Indications of similar systems of trenches exist at Chillingham Park in Northumberland and Erringden Park in Yorkshire, additionally \\"Montrose's Camp\\" near Fyvie Castle has features in common with deer hay winds famously militarily utilised by Montrose.Fletcher, p.160 Kington in Worcestershire is recorded to have had a deer hay.Fletcher, p.58 The as yet unidentified system of trenches and banks at the High Parks in the Cadzow Wood area (NS 7343 5347) of Chatelherault Country Park have a number of characteristics in common with deer hay winds and are located in an area closely associated with the hunting of deer by royalty and others.Cadzow - Canmore entry Some deer hay winds may have consisted of banks and ditches several kilometres long that were used to direct deer for the purpose of captureFletcher, p.58 such as with the so- called \\"Deil's Dyke\\" near New Cumnock.History of the Parish of New Cumnock Elricks have been identified at Dalkeith and others may have existed at the Glen of the Bar in Galloway, on R√πm and Jura where in one case stone walls may have channelled the deer into a corral.Fletcher, p.52 An unusual 'deer trap' may have been the function of a structure with foot high walls at Wet Sleddle Slack near Shap in Cumbria.Fletcher, p.57 A relevant quote here is that \\"Deer hunting has left physical traces on the landscape in the form of banks and dykes used either as park boundaries or for trapping the deer\\".History of the Parish of New Cumnock Micro-history The fourteenth century treatise The Book of Hunting illustrates a scene The Gathering before the Stag Hunt which clearly portrays wattle fencing of the kind used in a deer hay wind.Thomas, p.82 The town of Hayes in West Middlesex derives its name from the presence of a deer hay in the area. The village of Elrick near Aberdeen is named after an elrick and the surname 'Elrick' is common in the area.

Elliott appears again in Puppet Master, where he isn't very fond of Kurt's idea about performing in a local bar called Callbacks that is popular with NYADA students. Santana backs Elliott up on his insecurities of performing there but Kurt tells his dream and Elliott can be seen in the dream sequence. When Elliott and the band do appear at Callbacks only one person attends. Later, Kurt comes to Elliott and the band and informs them that their next gig is at a more popular place and then puppets arrive for the band from Blaine Anderson. (Darren Criss). In the new year, Elliott is invited over by Kurt because Kurt feels that Elliott is going to take over the band. Elliott takes Kurt guitar shopping and they sing I Believe in a Thing Called Love together. Elliott reassures Kurt that he isn't going to steal the band away from him and they then take a selfie. During Santana and Rachel's feud, Rachel moves into Elliott's apartment and he helps her practice her music and performs Barracuda with her. Later Santana and Rachel both drag Elliott up to the stage in the diner to perform a song called Gloria for a customer. Elliott, Dani and Kurt decide to disband the first band and start a trio band up without Rachel and Santana. Weeks later, Elliot appears and helps Kurt look for music for the band. Elliott tells Kurt that he and Blaine may need some space. They perform \\"Rockstar\\" together. Blaine confronts Elliott about trying to steal Kurt away but Elliott denies it.

Described as having one of the strongest personal brands in the United Kingdom‚Äôs fashion industry, Ciobanu has modelled and collaborated with a list of luxury fashion brands that includes Agent Provocateur, Burberry, and Versace. Her sustainability advocacy has seen her act as an ambassador of the No More Plastic foundation and the United Nations Development Programme.  Professional career  Ciobanu launched her fashion blog The Golden Diamonds in 2010 while living in Moldova where she turned down a university placement at the Sorbonne in Paris to pursue a full-time career in fashion. Moving to London in 2014, she was scouted and signed by Kate Moss‚Äô former manager as a digital influencer in the same year, shortly before being signed globally by Next Model Management as both an influencer and fashion model, the first Moldovan to do so and the first digital influencer to be signed by Next's London division. In London she worked beyond her platform on The Golden Diamonds, acting as a correspondent and writer for publications such as Byrdie, CR Fashion Book, Elle and The Guardian, and public speaking at events such as WGSN Futures Awards, the Festival of Marketing, Startup Grind, the UN Circular Fashion Summit, and Web Summit. Her mix of online presence and that of a social-event presence in London soon saw her labeled as a part of \\"the super blogger legion\\" and a \\"mega-blogger\\". Her mix of offline and online work saw her recognized by Forbes as both one of the top 19 Young Entrepreneurs and amongst the top 30 Under 30 entrepreneurs of Romania, twice as one of Romania‚Äôs most influential fashion icons,Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Romania (May‚ÄìJune 2013)Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Romania (November‚ÄìDecember 2013) and twice for 'Best Personal Style' by Elle.Elle Romania (December 2013) First modeling in Moldova, Ciobanu's management teams transitioned her work to include modeling on a larger scale as of 2015. She subsequently fronted campaigns for luxury brands including Agent Provocateur, Alain Mikli in a campaign that featured upon Times Square billboards, Bulgari, Bobbi Brown, Burberry, Cartier, De Grisogono, Dior, Ermenegildo Zegna, Fendi, L‚ÄôOr√©al, La Perla along with Kendall Jenner as the faces of the lingerie house‚Äôs Freedom range, Louis Vuitton, Paul Smith, Tom Ford, and Versace, and has featured in works by both photographers Ellen von Unwerth and Rankin. Her style and, separately, her modeling work have seen her featured in print upon the cover of Elle magazine, and in titles such as Glamour, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, Jane, Marie Claire, Tatler, The Telegraph, and international editions of Vogue. Ciobanu has also attracted the attention of men‚Äôs press, ranking amongst the AskMen‚Äôs Top 99 women of 2016, being labelled amongst \\"the most beautiful\\" bloggers by GQ Mexico, and becoming a regular in the British edition GQ, oft-featured as their ‚ÄòHottest Women of the Week‚Äô and at their social events. Since 2017, having begun to recognise \\"moral obligations\\" that came along with working as an influencer given her personal environmental beliefs were often at odds with many consumption practices driven by social media, Ciobanu has used her platforms to advocate for the fashion industry to become increasingly sustainabile. To this end she has accepted ambassadorships for Eco-Age, the No More Plastic foundation and the United Nations Development Programme and went on to study Business Sustainability Management at the University of Cambridge's' Institute for Sustainability Leadership. Outside of sustainability focussed speaking engagements, Ciobanu's advocacy for a sustainabile fashion industry has led to her being tapped as a judge for both Positive Luxury and The Sustainables Award. She has also served as consultant and designer for a number of fashion brands, launching the first sustainabile collection for jeweler Monica Vinader in August 2020. To achieve its sustainabile credentials, Ciobanu would focus her collection on the versatility of the jewellery and making it the first collection for Vinader to utilise 100-percent recycled sterling silver.  Personal life  Ciobanu was born in Chi»ôinƒÉu, living there till she was 19 before moving to Bucharest and subsequently to London. Having turned down a position at the University of Paris, Ciobanu corresponded to complete a long- distance bachelor's degree in Political Science and History from the Free International University of Moldova instead. By 2020 she had additionally completed business-focussed, sustainability studies at the University of Cambridge. Based in London, she maintains an interest in politics in Moldova and has stated that she would return there to be active in it.Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Romania (May‚ÄìJune 2014.

Biography She was born in Leeds, England, but trained in painting under Felice Casorati and design under Mario Micheletti in Turin. She is said to have moved to study music in Italy starting in 1906, joining her sister Geltrude who had married the prominent banker, Gaudenzio Sella.Notes for exhibition of Solo Donna by Gianfranco Schialvino in Bra 2011. By 1912, she had a series of designs completed in Biella. In 1916‚Äì1918, she began working for the Casa Gualino, as a designer until the 1940s.Jessie Boswell, article by Ivana Mulatero (27/6/2009) for exhibition by artist at Museo del Territorio Biellese, curated by Ivana Mulatero with the help of Pino Mantovani. She is described as being a dama di compagnia (personal assistant/chief of staff) at Casa Gualino from 1913 to 1928.Fondazione de Fornaris, short biography. She lived with the family at the Castello di Cereseto and was close to Riccardo's wife, Cesarina Gualino.History of Theater in Turin, il caso Gualino. Riccardo Gualino, a rich industrialist, was also a patron of the arts, including Casorati, and later of the Gruppo dei Sei until his financial collapse starting in 1929. She exhibited at the Venice Biennali from 1924 to 1930. In 1929‚Äì1931, she displayed her works along with a group dubbed the Gruppo dei Sei, including Gigi Chessa, Nicola Galante, Carlo Levi, Francesco Menzio, and Enrico Paulucci. Boswell's work shows a strong influence of Matisse and the simplified compositions of Amedeo Modigliani.Ivana Mulatero article. The group shared post-impressionist and yet expressionist styles of painting; Jessie's subjects included landscapes, cityscapes, marine scenes, portraits, and still lifes. Boswell's patron was confined by the Mussolini government for years. Jessie, however, became an Italian citizen in 1936 and spent the second world war in the country. She had a personal exhibition in Biella in 1944. In 1948, she retired to a nursing home in Moncrivello, where she would die.Gianfranco Schialvino notes.

It was amended in 2015 and further amendment passed in Lok Sabha on 1 August 2019. The Government of India decided to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 by introducing the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Parliament. In an attempt to make arbitration a preferred mode of settlement of commercial disputes and making India a hub of international commercial arbitration, the President of India on 23 October 2015 promulgated an Ordinance (Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015) amending the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, had given its approval for amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2015 2015 Amendment The following are the salient features of the new ordinance, introduced in 2015: :The first and foremost amendment introduced by the ordinance, is with respect to definition of expression ' Court '. The amended law makes a clear distinction between an international commercial arbitration and domestic arbitration with regard to the definition of 'Court'. In so far as domestic arbitration is concerned, the definition of \\"Court\\" is the same as was in the 1996 Act, however, for the purpose of international commercial arbitration, 'Court' has been defined to mean only High Court of competent jurisdiction. Accordingly, in an international commercial arbitration, as per the new law, district court will have no jurisdiction and the parties can expect speedier and efficacious determination of any issue directly by the High court which is better equipped in terms of handling commercial disputes. :Through the amendment, a proviso to Section 2(2) has been added which envisages that subject to the agreement to the contrary, Section 9 (interim measures), Section 27(taking of evidence), and Section 37(1)(a), 37(3) shall also apply to international commercial arbitration, even if the seat of arbitration is outside India, meaning thereby that the new law has tried to strike a kind of balance between the situations created by the judgments of Bhatia International and Balco v. Kaiser.

Early life and education Morris, the grandson of sharecroppers, was born in rural Tutwiler, Mississippi. As a child he experienced Jim Crow racism and segregation; one of his earliest memories was the lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till. He moved to Chicago with his family, and enrolled at Southeast Community College in 1968. Morris studied sociology and social movements at Bradley University and the State University of New York, Stony Brook, receiving his PhD in 1980.  Career  Morris was an associate professor of sociology at the University of Michigan from 1980 to 1990. He joined the faculty of Northwestern University in 1988, where he now serves as the Leon Forrest professor of sociology and African-American Studies. Previously at Northwestern, he chaired the sociology department, directed Asian American Studies, served as associate dean for faculty affairs, and served as interim dean for the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. Morris was inspired by the oration of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the scholarship of sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois, the first black man to earn a doctorate from Harvard University. In 2005, Morris and a group of peers persuaded the American Sociological Association to rename their top award after Du Bois. In his 2015 book, The Scholar Denied: W. E. B. Du Bois and the Birth of Modern Sociology, Morris argued that Du Bois was the founder of modern American sociology, and that his contributions to the field were suppressed for decades due to institutional racism. In 2019, Morris was elected as President-Elect of the American Sociological Association. Morris will serve as the 112th President the Association in 2021, succeeding Christine Williams.

He is a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA), having joined in 2001. He is one of the few PBA bowlers to successfully use the one-handed no-thumb delivery. Although Daugherty has won two PBA Tour titles and 16 PBA Regional titles, he is perhaps best known for rolling a nationally-televised 100 game at the 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions, the lowest score ever bowled in a televised PBA event. He has accumulated 21 career 300 games in PBA events. Daugherty is a pro staff member for Hammer bowling balls, Dexter shoes, and Turbo Inserts. PBA career Daugherty became a PBA member in 2001, and started bowling regularly on the PBA Tour in the 2003‚Äì04 season. After three seasons of little success as a full time Tour bowler, he returned to bowling mostly in PBA Regional Tour events for the next six seasons. =The 100 game= By way of his Regional Tour titles, Daugherty made the initial \\"Champions\\" field for the 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions. He fought his way into the \\"Elite\\" field and made the January 22 televised finals as the #2 seed, where he faced #3 seed Mika Koivuniemi in the semifinal match. Daugherty wound up on the wrong end of PBA history that day, rolling seven splits en route to a record-low 100 score. (The previous low score on television was 129, shot by Steve Jaros.) With Koivuniemi nearly missing perfection and bowling a 299 in the same match, Daugherty also became half of the most lopsided match in PBA history (‚Äì199 pins). Despite the embarrassment, Daugherty ran around and high-fived the crowd after making the two pins he needed to reach the 100 mark. He cashed $50,000 for his third-place finish. In the next season‚Äôs Tournament of Champions, Daugherty again made the Elite Field and was candid about the previous year‚Äôs debacle: :\\"That 100 game was the best thing that ever happened to me. I have no problem with it. No one would remember me if I hadn't bowled that game. No one remembers Tom Smallwood and he finished second last year.\\" =Success in 2012= Daugherty returned to full-time touring status in the 2012‚Äì13 PBA season. He finally found success, winning his first national PBA Tour title on November 11, 2012 at the PBA Bowlers Journal Scorpion Championship in Las Vegas. =Additional career highlights= Daugherty finished third at the 2015 PBA Players Championship, his best finish in a major since 2011. He was also a member of the Bass Pro Shops Silver Lake Atom Splitters team, which won the 2015 PBA League Elias Cup team title. Daugherty made the TV finals for the 2016 PBA Tournament of Champions and the 2016 USBC Masters, but could not complete the quest for a title in either of these major events. He would win his second PBA Tour title on September 10, 2016 at the PBA Wolf Open in Allen Park, Michigan. Daugherty was again a member of the Silver Lake Atom Splitters team, which won the PBA League title in 2018. While he didn't win a title in 2019, Daugherty made a career-high 13 match play rounds and cashed a career-high $74,155 in PBA Tour earnings. Personal Daugherty has three daughters (Camryn and twins Cayce and Courtney) and a son (Kody). In addition to earning a living on the lanes, he operates two bowling pro shops in the Tampa Bay Area.

The film examines the ivory trade, which has become a global concern, pitting governments and environmental preservationalists against poachers and Chinese ivory merchants. The Ivory Game had its world premiere on September 16, 2016 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released to Netflix on November 4, 2016. The film received mostly positive reviews.  Synopsis  The documentary concerns the poaching of elephants in Africa, related to the ivory trade in China and Hong Kong, and the repercussions of elephant poaching if it is allowed to continue. Directors Keif Davidson and Richard Ladkani spent 16 months undercover along with their crew and several subjects investigating the killing of elephants for their tusks and the smuggling of ivory to China, where it is seen as a status symbol. While illegal, there is a rampant black market where corrupt business practices and dealings occur. The film takes its viewers from Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia to China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam, briefly stopping in London. The film opens in Tanzania, Africa, where Elisifa Ngowi, the head of intelligence for the Task Force, along with his officers, are conducting a nighttime sting operation in an attempt to arrest Shetani, one of the most notorious poachers in the region. Shetani is responsible for the deaths of 10,000 elephants alone. While Ngowi is tracking Shetani and the poachers, Craig Millar, head of security at the Big Life Foundation in Kenya, is trying to stop poaching from happening in the first place. Millar‚Äôs team spend their days and nights protecting elephants on the vast savanna, scaring off poachers and preventing local residents from attacking elephants that have destroyed their food crops. In China, Andrea Crosta, who is head of investigation for Wildleaks, a whistle-blowing site for ‚Äúwildlife crime‚Äù, and Hongxiang Huang, an investigative journalist, go undercover to gather evidence of illegal importing and selling of ivory. China has become the world‚Äôs biggest market for ivory. The Chinese government releases 5 tons of ivory per year to licensed dealers, making it difficult to discern between legal and illegal ivory. Crosta and Huang, along with their hidden cameras, expose many dealers bragging about having much more ivory than their licenses allow and reveals the many loopholes in ivory regulations which have helped create an intense demand. The documentary reports that if governments do not take action now or in the near future, elephants are facing extinction within the next 15 years.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has a score of 89% based on 18 reviews with an average rating of 7.8 out of 10. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 73 with generally favourable reviews from 12 critics. TheWrap stated that The Ivory Game vitally offers a wealth of information and means to incite action, which may be enough to get audiences involved\\". Connect Statesboro called the film \\"impactful and will make viewers seriously consider the simple concluding invitation to take action by visiting theivorygame.com\\". The Hollywood Reporter hailed the film as \\"sweeping, thoughtful and often wrenching\\", and \\"deserving of the attention that it is sure to receive\\".  Awards and nominations  The Ivory Game was nominated for the People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2016. Additionally, the film was nominated for and won the WWF Golden Panda Award and the Theatrical Award at the 2016 Wildscreen Festival, held in Bristol.  Impact  The filmmakers' goal is to show the complexities of the multi-million dollar ivory trade throughout The Ivory Game and is meant to incite a worldwide call to stop the ivory trade. While the impact of the film remains to be seen, The Playlist states that \\"a better film would have taken aim at the roots of poaching and ivory as a status symbol, but The Ivory Game still manages to incite the necessary outrage\\". On March 3, 2017, in Dodoma, Tanzania the poachers that this documentary was based on were convicted in a magistrate‚Äôs court to 12 years in prison, after being convicted of leading organized crime. Poacher Boniface Methew Malyango, nicknamed \\"The Devil Has No Mercy\\", who was the subject of this documentary, his brothers Lucas Mathayo Malyango and Abdallah Ally Chaoga were arrested in October 2015 while attempting to smuggle 118 elephant tusks worth over $863,000.

Early life and education Philip Murgor was born on the 4th of July 1961 at Iten District Hospital to Christine Chebor, a nurse, in Elgeyo Marakwet District (now Elgeyo-Marakwet County), Kenya. His father, Charles Murgor, was employed by colonial administration as a District Officer. Murgor spent his formative school years in Kiambu town, Central Province and Kisumu town, Nyanza Province. His father Charles retired as a Provincial Commissioner in 1969 and the family moved to Eldoret in present-day Uasin Gishu County. = Education = In 1981, he joined the University of Nairobi for his undergraduate Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree. Upon graduation in 1985, he joined the Kenya School of Law for his post graduate Diploma in Law while undertaking his pupillage at Hamilton Harrison and Matthews. = Coup D'√©tat = During the abortive coup d'√©tat by the Kenya Air Force in 1982, Murgor and a couple of his classmates were arrested and charged with being sympathetic to the coup and demonstrating with seditious intentions. Murgor and his classmates were incarcerated to await trial under the authority of the then Attorney General of Kenya Joseph Kamere. He spent several months imprisoned before the incoming Attorney-General Matthew Guy-Muli who served as the Attorney General of Kenya between 1983 and 1991 dropped all charges against Philip and his classmates due to lack of evidence. = Kenya School of Law = Murgor went on to finalize his Bachelor of Laws with honors and thereafter, his post graduate diploma program at the Kenya School of Law. While at the School of Law in 1986, he was selected, among seven others, to participate in an American student exchange program. During this period he had the opportunity to intern at the Superior Court of the United States in Washington DC. In 2008, he returned to his alma mater University of Nairobi for his Master of Laws (LLM) in International Trade and Investments Law for which he graduated with honors in 2011.  Early career  As a law student, Murgor interned at Mereka & Company which specialized in insurance law. Thereafter, he joined Hamilton Harrison and Matthews, one of the oldest law firms with a strong commercial civil litigation practice. After completing his studies, in 1986 he took a position as State Counsel in the Public Prosecutions Department, where he was posted to the Kisumu Provincial State Counsel Office. As a criminal prosecutor, he was responsible for advising and directing the criminal investigators on the adequacy or direction of their investigations to ensure successful prosecutions. Public Prosecutor of Kenya Bernard Chunga transferred Murgor back to Nairobi in 1992 = President Daniel arap Moi Election Petition Case = In 1992 Murgor resigned from the civil service and joined his wife in private practice at Murgor and Murgor Advocates. He was appointed to the legal team that defended President Daniel arap Moi in election petitions filed after the first multiparty general elections in 1992. = Goldenberg Scandal = In 1995, he was appointed by the Central Bank of Kenya to unravel the Goldenberg scandal and recover the billions lost in the scam. His successful handling of the scandal cases on behalf of the Central Bank of Kenya against Kamlesh Pattni and his associates led to direct threats to his life, which forced him to go public on the same. Thereafter, he was denied his legal fees in an attempt to force him to compromise the cases. He was eventually forced to quit the cases in 1998, rather than succumb to the threats. When Mwai Kibaki became President in 2003 on an anti-corruption platform, the president immediately re-appointed him to the Goldenberg scandal cases, and a month later he was appointed as the Public Prosecutor, a post he reluctantly accepted on condition that he would be granted a free hand in reforming the failed public prosecution services, and prosecution perpetrators of grand corruption. By 2004, the Kibaki government had fallen back on its anti-corruption pledges, and many of officials had slipped into corruption the most significant of which was the Anglo-Leasing Scandal and trafficking of cocaine. = Anglo-Leasing Scandal = Murgor faced resistance in relation to the prosecution of Anglo-Leasing Scandal and a thorough investigation into a case involving the trafficking of 1.2 tonnes of cocaine worth KShs 6.4 billion. The cases were thwarted by Presidential insiders. The correlation between the prosecution and threats to his person was heightened when his home was attacked. He was terminated as Public Prosecutor in May 2005.  Private Practice Career  Murgor returned to private practice as a Litigation Partner at Murgor and Murgor Advocates. In 2007, he took over as the Managing Partner at the Firm when his wife was appointed as Group Counsel and company secretary for East African Breweries Limited (EABL).

Anderson, 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; (1972). People v. Anderson, 70 Cal.2d 15, 447 P.2d 942 (1968), is a California criminal case involving evidentiary criteria for the element of premeditation in a first degree murder prosecution, to be sufficient to go to the jury.Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed 2012; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder The case sets forth three categories of evidentiary factors necessary for evidence to be sufficient to support a jury verdict of first degree murder. The underlying case involved a man drinking, stripping the clothes off of the 10-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend, then stabbing the child 60 times, including after she was already dead. A question on appeal was as to whether there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find the element of premeditation. The court wrote: ::The type of evidence which this court has found sufficient to sustain a finding of premeditation and deliberation falls into three categories: (1) facts about how and what defendant did prior to the actual killing which show that the defendant was engaged in activity directed toward, and explicable as intended to result in, the killing - what may be considered as 'planning' activity; (2) facts about the defendant's prior relationship and/or conduct with the victim from which the jury could reasonably infer a 'motive' to kill the victim, which inference of motive, together with facts of type (1) or (3), would in turn support an inference that the killing was the result of a 'pre-existing reflection' and 'careful thought and weighing of considerations' rather than 'mere unconsidered rash impulse hastily executed' (People v. Thomas, 25 Cal. 2d 880), (3) facts about the nature of killing from which the jury could infer that the manner of killing was so particular and exacting that the defendant must have intentionally killed according to a 'preconceived design' to take his victim's life in a particular way for a 'reason' which the jury can reasonably infer from facts of type (1) or (2). ::Analysis of the cases will show that this court sustains verdicts of first degree murder typically when there is evidence of all three types and otherwise requires at least extremely strong evidence of (1) or evidence of (2) in conjunction with either (1) or (3).

Her older sister is Catherine Oxenberg. Princess Elizabeth is the only daughter of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia (who served as regent for his cousin's eldest son King Peter II of Yugoslavia) and Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark. Elizabeth is a maternal first cousin of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and also a maternal second cousin of Queen Sof√≠a of Spain and Charles, Prince of Wales, making Christina a third cousin of Felipe VI of Spain and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Through her maternal grandfather Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, of the House of Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, Christina is also a great-great-great-granddaughter of Karageorge, who started the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804. Christina Oxenberg's maternal grandmother, Princess Olga, was the daughter of Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia and Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, himself the son of another Romanov grand duchess, Queen Olga Konstantinovna of the Hellenes and her Danish-born husband King George of Greece, brother of Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom and the Empress Maria Fyodorovna. Princess Olga was the sister of Princess Marina, who married Prince George, Duke of Kent (an uncle of Queen Elizabeth II); and Olga/Marina were also paternal first cousins of the Duke of Edinburgh (husband of Queen Elizabeth II) through their respective fathers Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark and Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, who were brothers.David Lewis, William Addams Reitwiesner, Persons eligible to succeed to the British Throne as of 1 Jan 2011 at wargs.com, accessed January 17, 2019 She attended 14 different schools in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain, including the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Charles de Gaulle in Kensington, and graduated from the Colorado Rocky Mountain School in Carbondale, Colorado, in 1981. Career After high school, Oxenberg worked various jobs in New York ranging from a secretary to a roller-rink attendant. She would then go on a backpacking trip around the world before returning to New York City. Upon her return, Oxenberg secured a job at Studio 54. Between 1984 and 1985, she worked as a research assistant for historian, Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, on his book Blenheim Revisited. In 1986, she published her first book, Taxi, a collection of celebrity anecdotes and personal observations revolving around experiences in taxicabs. In Taxi, Andy Warhol, Bob Costas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and numerous others are featured. Christina Oxenberg married painter Damian Elwes near Amman, Jordan, in May 1986. They later divorced. In 1994, Simon & Schuster commissioned Oxenberg to write a semi-autobiographical novel that would eventually be published as Royal Blue. The novel was released in 1997 in the United States and was published by Quartet in the United Kingdom in 1998. The book is fictional but contains true elements. The book received generally favorable reviews from publications like The Independent The Guardian, and The Times. As a result of the book, Oxenberg appeared on the cover of New York Magazine and was profiled in People. It was called \\"darkly funny\\" by the Chicago Tribune. In 2000, Oxenberg went on hiatus from writing and took a job at Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Waterkeeper Alliance. Through that job she met Fernando Alvarez, a Peruvian businessman living in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The two discussed the possibility of a clothing line using Oxenberg's name. They designed, produced and wholesaled a collection of knitwear. The pair used fibers such as the guanaco from Patagonia, the suri-alpaca from the high Andes and the muskox from the indigenous population in the North West Territories of Canada. From 2002 to 2010, Oxenberg produced two clothing lines (Christina Oxenberg and Ox). Christina Oxenberg would go on to self-publish several collections of short stories between 2010 and 2014, including Do These Gloves Make My Ass Look Fat?, Life is Short: Read Short Stories, and When in Doubt...Double the Dosage. Additionally, her writing has appeared in publications like Allure, Penthouse, The Sunday Times, Takimag (where she published a weekly column), HuffPost (where she currently publishes weekly columns), and others. In 2011, she moved from the Northeastern United States to Key West, Florida. Many of the stories in her short story collections like Will Write for Compliments and Life is Short: Read Short Stories are about or set in Key West. Since 2012 Oxenberg has contributed articles to Key West weekly magazine Konk Life. In 2014, Oxenberg helped organize a visit by John Hemingway (Ernest Hemingway's grandson) to David Wolkowsky's Tennessee Williams Collection. In 2015, Christina Oxenberg moved to Serbia for a year to write and research her book, Royal Dynasty ‚Äì An Insider's History of the Serbian Royal Family, which was published in Serbian in 2015 by the publisher, Laguna. For her work, Oxenberg received an award from the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2016. In February 2018, Dynasty: A True Story was published in English in the UK by the publisher, Quartet Books. Subsequently, Oxenberg was interviewed by the Sunday Times, Radio Gorgeous and Tatler, and she presented the book at the Oxford Literary Festival on 22 March 2018.

He was the oldest West Point graduate to serve in the Confederacy in that war. He is the younger brother of Ren√© Edward De Russy, a U.S. brigadier general, who remained with the Union during the war. Both men had forts named after them. That named for Louis is Fort DeRussy, constructed near Marksville, Louisiana during the Civil War. Life De Russy was born in 1795 and grew up in New York City. His father Thomas De Russy had served in the French Navy, moving to the American Navy during the American Revolutionary War (France was at that point allied with the rebels). After returning to France, he left in 1786 as tensions were rising that led to the French Revolution and gone to family lands in Saint-Domingue, the wealthiest French colony in the Caribbean. He settled in Cap Fran√ßais and married a French colonist, Madeleine Baissiere, there in 1787. Their first two sons, Rene Emile and Ren√© Edward De Russy, were born on the island. In 1792, the family had to leave quickly because the city was burning from the Haitian Revolution. They lost all their property but safely reached New York City.Steven M. Mayeux, Earthen Walls, Iron Men: Fort DeRussy, Louisiana, and the Defense of Red River, University of Tennessee Press, 2007, Appendix A: Lewis Gustave DeRussy, pp. 270‚Äì276 Military and engineering career At the age of 18, after eleven months as a cadet, on March 11, 1814, De Russy graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The fact that the War of 1812 was still on may have accelerated his graduation. On January 7, 1816 he married Elizabeth Claire Boerum, from an old Dutch family. They eventually had seven children together before her death in 1836. After being part of the surveying party to set the US-Canadian border in 1819‚Äì1821, De Russy had steady engineering assignments and advanced in his career. In September 1826, De Russy was promoted to major and assigned to the Red River outposts in central Louisiana. He and his family lived between Fort Jesup and Natchitoches. He had most of the remainder of his career and life in Louisiana. De Russy was passed over and dropped from the Army in 1842, during a reduction in forces. He devoted himself to his plantation and to private engineering jobs. After serving as a major in the state militia, in December 1846 he joined the 1st Louisiana Regiment of Volunteers, being elected to the rank of colonel, and led the regiment in the Mexican War. In July 1847 they fought in the Battle of Tantayuka, their only combat. They were garrisoned at Tampico, where De Russy directed a project to improve traffic on the waterway. After their return to Louisiana, he served as major general in the state militia. In 1851 he was elected to the state house and, at the end of the two- year term, to the state senate. He also worked on several major engineering projects and a survey of the Red River. During the American Civil War, he served the Confederacy as Chief Engineer, working on projects near the Red River. He died at his home on December 17, 1864; historians believe he had a heart attack. Legacy and honors * Fort DeRussy, constructed during the Civil War near Marksville, Louisiana, was named for him.

The non-profit is funded by the Papua New Guinea government and individual donations. History Samaritan Aviation was founded in 1999 by Mark Palm and GT Bustin as a means of providing crucial medical services to the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea. To avoid the difficult transport through 30,000 square miles of jungle, Samaritan Aviation introduced the country‚Äôs only floatplane in 2010, a retrofitted Cessna 206, which dramatically increased the availability of healthcare to around 500,000 people. In August 2015, Samaritan Aviation launched a multi-city tour, introducing their second Cessna 206 floatplane and making stops in Dallas, San Antonio, Denver, Montrose, Prescott, Mesa, and Kingman before shipping the plane to Papua New Guinea. Samaritan Aviation provides emergency transport to hospital for child whose hip had been dislocated for 3 weeks Over the years, the floatplanes have acted as flying ambulances and transport for vaccines to prevent the spread of measles, whooping cough, and polio. After adding a second plane, two additional pilots (three in total), and a Medical Director over the course of 10 years of operations, Samaritan Aviation began planning for expansion to Papua New Guinea‚Äôs Western Province. Another city tour was organized to raise funds for the planned expansion, including stops in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama and Texas. Partnerships =National Polio Campaign= Dr. Preston Karue, the PHA Rural Health Coordinator, educates a rural village about polio during the National Polio CampaignAfter a resurgence of polio cases in 2018, Samaritan Aviation was called upon to partner with the ESP Provincial Health Authority, World Health Organization, and Rotary International to aid in the National Polio Vaccine Outreach. Through the use of their floatplanes, Samaritan Aviation made deliveries of polio vaccines and cold storage equipment to remote villages in the East Sepik Province.

The University of Chicago  History of Evolutionary Theory in Archaeology  = Evolutionary archaeology in the 19th century = Over the past decades the term ‚Äòevolution‚Äô has undertaken several definitions and implications. However, when referring to ‚Äúhuman history and the development of long term trends it is used interchangeably with social or sociocultural evolution‚Äù.Stephen S.(2008).Evolution in Archaeology. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 37 , pp. 75-91. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species profoundly influenced the biological and social sciences. However, 19th century evolutionary archaeologists were influenced by the unilineal evolutionary schemes of Herbert Spencer and others. Herbert Spencer embraced a teleological notion where evolution was seen as having an ultimate and definite goal. Spencerian theory incorporated a progressive, unilineal explanation of cultural evolution in which human societies were seen as progressing through a fixed set of stages, from ‚Äúsavagery‚Äù through ‚Äúbarbarism‚Äù to ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù.Tehrani, J. J. & Collard, M. (2002) Investigating cultural evolution through biological phylogenetic analyses of Turkmen textiles. Journal of Anthropological Archaeology 21:443‚Äì 63 Thus, for much of the 19th century evolutionary theory in archaeology was centered around explaining cultural traits and human history and account for the significant differences between cultural groups and their current state of living. Initially it focused on human transitions from foragers to horticulturalist, to implementation of agriculture, and eventually rise of civilizations. Even into the early 20th century, evolutionary archaeologists, or cultural evolutionists, maintained a thoroughly non-Darwinian notion of evolution‚Äù.Bettinger, Robert I.(1991)Hunter-gatherers: Archaeological and evolutionary requires a different kind of metaphysic from other ‚Äò‚Äòhard‚Äô‚Äô theory. New York and London: Plenum Press. = Evolutionary archaeology in the early-to-mid 20th century = \\"The social and political implications of early cultural evolutionary thinking, such as eugenics and other atrocities, understandably promoted a reaction, and the social sciences turned towards a thoroughly anti-biological stance: The Standard Social Science Model.Barkow, J. H., Cosmides, L. & Tooby, J., eds. (1992) The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture. Oxford University Press. Therefore, a strong resistance among social scientists rose arguing for limited biological restraints on human behavior. This reaction led to the acceptance of social influences and culture affecting and changing human behavior. The Standard Social Science Model, assumes that ‚Äúculture is selected by free agents making active, unconstrained choices, and there has been a tendency to stress the vast plethora of different cultural practices rather than to look for cultural universals‚Äù (Workman and Reader, 2004). The acceptance of the Standard Social Science Model and rejection of explanatory evolutionary theories in anthropology, resulted in Darwinian theory not being applied by anthropologist and archaeologist. As Dunnell (1980) surmises, ‚ÄúIn the 1950s due to the influence of Boasian school of thought, a dissatisfaction with the supposed Marxist connotations of evolution, and failure to accommodate a complex archaeological record, evolutionary theory was no longer a prevalent method used to explain archaeological phenomena‚Äù.Dunnell,R.C (1980) Evolutionary Theory and Archaeology.Advances in Archaeological Method and Theory, Vol. 3 , pp. 35-99. In the 1960s, Binford introduced a new explanatory framework in archaeology known as ‚ÄúNew Archaeology‚Äù or ‚ÄúProcessual Archaeology‚Äù. This framework incorporated an evolutionary foundation, which was previously omitted in archaeology. This was a crucial step in archaeology since it acknowledged the need for a scientific explanation in the archaeological record and not just descriptive accounts. Dunnell (1980) claims that even though the New Archaeology program insists on incorporating a scientific method, remnants of the early 1900s notion of evolution still remained, therefore ‚Äòevolution‚Äô as it is used in the hard sciences, has yet to be utilized with the same rigidity in the social sciences, specifically in archaeology (Dunnell,1980). = Neo-Darwinian Theory in Archaeology = The modern evolutionary synthesis, also called neo-Darwinian theory, was developed in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1970s and 1980s, with the groundbreaking works of E.O. Wilson. Hamilton and R. Dawkins, a shift occurred from social-cultural explanation of human behavior to the return of biological, reductionist explanations based on neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.Richerson, P. J. & Boyd, R. (2005) Not by genes alone: How culture transformed human evolution. University of Chicago Press. This is sometimes called the sociobiology approach. It provided a rich theoretical groundwork for analyzing culture in terms of modern evolutionary theory, but also developed ‚Äúrigorous mathematical treatments of cultural change inspired by population genetic models‚Äù. With the works of Cavalli Sforza and FeldmanCavalli-Sforza, L. L. & Feldman, M. W. (1981) Cultural transmission and evolution. Princeton University Press and Boyd and Richerson,Boyd, R. & Richerson, P. J. (1985) Culture and the evolutionary process. University of Chicago Press. evolutionary archaeology become a more utilized approach. Over the last three decades, two main evolutionary frameworks emerged in archaeology: Evolutionary Archaeology (EA) and Evolutionary Ecology (EE). The former draws on analogies with genetic and biological evolution in that it focuses on variation in cultural traits and attempts to reconstruct their phylogenetic histories. The latter views variation in artifacts as reflecting adaptive human behavior.  Evolutionary Archaeology  = Cultural Traits = EA focuses on cultural \\"traits\\" (or memes) and conceives of them as analogies to genes. That is, cultural traits and genes both have the three characteristics necessary for natural selection (variation, selection, and inheritance) as well as non-selective processes, such as drift. Defining the terms \\"culture\\" and \\"cultural traits\\" are key to effective EA research.Mesoudi, A., Whiten, A. & Dunbar, R. (2006) Towards a unified science of cultural evolution. Behaviroal and Brain Sciences 29, 329 ‚Äì383. Richerson and Boyd (2005), define culture as ‚Äúinformation capable of affecting individual‚Äôs behavior that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, imitation, and other forms of social transmission‚Äù. ‚ÄúInformation‚Äù is employed as a broad term incorporating ideas, knowledge, beliefs, values, skills, and attitudes (Mesoudi, 2006). Variation, selection, and inheritance are necessary for changes of material remains (cultural traits) observed in the archaeological record.Mesoudi, A. & Whiten, A. (2004) The hierarchical transformation of event knowledge in human cultural transmission. Journal of Cognition and Culture 4:1‚Äì 24. These traits can go extinct as a result of competition, change in function or become vestigial, and adapt to their environment, as demonstrated by the work of human behavioral ecologistsSmith, E. A. & Winterhalder, B., eds. (1992) Evolutionary ecology and human behavior. Aldinede Gruyter. (Smith & Winterhalder 1992). They can be identified as analogous traits of exhibit the process of convergent evolution. Geographical distribution of cultural traits can vary through diffusion and can be explained by an evolutionary framework. Mesoudi et al. (2004), argues that Darwinian theory became successful without the knowledge of Mendelian inheritance, therefore cultural evolution does not have to rely on memes or ‚Äúor particulate cultural transmission, a topical issue but one of great contention‚Äù. Evolutionary Archaeology is based on the notion that claims culture exhibits key Darwinian evolutionary properties. Therefore, on this basis, EA should follow the same, methods, and approaches that are used to study biological evolution and by doing so it can productively be applied to the study of human culture. By incorporating a comparison with the biological sciences, EA claims that the analysis of cultural will have scientific merit and lead to more progressive theoretical framework, that has yet to be employed in the analysis of cultural and social anthropology (archaeology as well) (Boone & Smith 1998). EA emphasizes the role of natural selection in affecting human behavior and do not consider the need to understand changing cultural traditions as part of their framework (Shennan 2008). Evolutionary archaeologist claim EA is not employing scientific metaphors from biology to explain archaeological process, but instead these evolutionary outlooks can elucidate the effect ‚Äúon the questions asked, the taxonomies employed, and the role of archaeology as a discipline in a wider scientific and public landscape‚Äù (Mesoudi 2006). Runciman (2005) claims that the goal of archaeologists working within an evolutionary paradigm is to explain how and why particular cultural traits become more common than others over time.Runciman, W. G. (2005) Culture does evolve. History and Theory 44:1 ‚Äì 13. Shennan (2004b) states that even though archaeologist seek to understand human history and prehistory, the theoretical framework and methods should not be limited to teleological explanations of ‚Äòprogress‚Äô, but archaeologist should play to their strengths, ‚Äúwhich undoubtedly lie in the characterization of long-term patterning in past societies‚Äù. Overall as summarized by Mesoudi (2006) it is necessary to understand individual choices and historical events because they are parts of evolutionary history. Especially since humans, unlike other species, are continuously generating and altering the social and physical environments to which they have to adapt. =Phylogenetics= According to Mesoudi (2006) it is necessary to treat cultural traits as analogous to biological characters. By using this analogy, it allows anthropologists and archaeologists, to apply strict phylogenetic methods to cultural data, no differently than evolutionary biologists (Mesoudi, 2006). The logic behind this approach is that like biologists, anthropologists share the same fundamental goals. The first goal is to reconstruct the historical timeline of a specific trait, and the second goal is to distinguish and identify patterns of change(Mesoudi,2006). Mesoudi states that there have been several anthropological and archaeological studies utilizing this approach (phylogenetics) and have been deemed successful by ‚Äúdetermining whether a group of traits are related by descent, whether their spread was associated with other traits, or whether they generated selection for other traits‚Äù (2006). Specifically, this phylogenetic approach is crucial for archaeologists who are seeking to employ evolutionary paradigms in their research. Just as paleobiologist, archaeologists seek to answer similar research questions and tasks. In sum, their goals are ‚Äúidentifying prehistoric artifacts, reconstructing lineages of these artifacts and of the people associated with them, and revealing the evolutionary relationships between these lineages‚Äù (Mesoudi, 2006). Even the means of gathering data are similar if not the same. Both paleobiologist/paleontologist and archaeologists engage in excavations to retrieve information about past specimens. Evolutionary archaeologists, thus, have shared the similar tools and methodological trajectories as paleobiologists. For example, O‚ÄôBrien & Lyman (2000) uses the evolutionary ‚Äúpopulation thinking‚Äù explanatory frameworks,O‚ÄôBrien, M. J. & Lyman, R. L. (2000) Applying evolutionary archaeology: A systematic approach. Kluwer Academic/Plenum. while Mace & Holden (2005) use cladisticsMace, R. & Holden, C. J. (2005) A phylogenetic approach to cultural evolution. Trends in Ecology and Evolution 20:116 ‚Äì 21. and Neiman (1995) and uses models of selection or drift.Neiman, F. D. (1995) Stylistic variation in evolutionary perspective: Inferences from decorative diversity and inter assemblage distance in Illinois woodland ceramic assemblages.American Antiquity 60:7 ‚Äì 36. Mesoudi (2006) positions, that only in recent development have archaeologist started utilizing these phylogenetic approached in analyzing material remains and human history. =Seriation and Cladistics= Seriation has not always been excluded from archaeological methods, according to Mesoudi (2006), ‚Äúearly archaeologists used the method of seriation to identify lineages of coinsEvans, J. (1850) On the date of British coins. The Numismatic Chronicle and Journal of the Numismatic Society 12:127 ‚Äì 37. (Evans 1850), stone toolsPitt-Rivers, L.-G. A. L. (1875) On the evolution of culture. Journal of the Anthropological Institute 4:293‚Äì 308. (PittRivers 1875), and Egyptian pottery Petrie, W. M. F. (1899) Sequences in prehistoric remains. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 29:295‚Äì 301.(Petrie 1899)‚Äù. However, this approach was no longer employed by archaeologists in the 20th century because of a rise in the essentialist approach to archaeology, where cultural trait change occurs when one type transforms into another(2003) Cultural traits: Units of analysis in early twentieth-century anthropology. Journal of Anthropological Research 59:225 ‚Äì 50 (Lyman and O‚ÄôBrien,2003).This again, is drastically different from the methods evolutionary archeologist employ. They view which recognizes naturally occurring variation within populations rather than focusing on typological descriptions (Mesoudi, 2006). Applying phylogenetic theory in archaeology and paleobiology takes on a fundamental assumption. This is that similar traits that vary through time are ‚Äúcausally connected by inheritance‚Äù which O‚ÄôBrien & Lyman (2000) term the assumption of ‚Äúheritable continuity‚Äù. These evolutionary lineages according to Simpson (1961) serve as a means to define a species.Simpson, G. G.(1961) Principles of animal taxonomy. Columbia University Press. Furthermore, Hull (1982) has argued for the idea of lineage based species to serve as an explanatory framework for culture.Hull, D. L. (1982) The naked meme. In: Learning, development and culture: Essays in evolutionary epistemology, ed. H. C. Plotkin, pp. 273 ‚Äì 327. John Wiley. O‚ÄôBrien and Lyman (2000) are some of the first archaeologist to systematically employ this phylogenetic approach to material remains, specifically, have expanded the theory to explain prehistoric artifacts. They argue that by employing seriation methods to the archaeological record they can reconstruct the evolutionary lineages of artifacts (O‚ÄôBrien and Lyman 2000). This is accomplished by collecting an assemblage of material remains of a specific cultural trait, such a projectile point, and then artifacts are ordered by similarity. Essentially the more in common two artifacts are, the closer together placed on a phylogenetic diagram, the less they have in common, the further apart they are placed (Mesoudi, 2006). Seriation represents an evolutionary lineage connected by cultural transmission when artifacts show gradual, and coincidental change. O‚ÄôBrien and Lyman (2000) are major proponents for reintroducing seriation into archaeology. They believe using this approach they can study evolutionary change in artifacts. One main example is their research based on the analysis of Southwestern United States projectile points. By employing these phylogenic and specifically seriation methods they ‚Äúshow continuous, and gradually changing variation rather than a small number of distinct types‚Äù (Mesoudi, 2006). They are practitioners of this approach because they argue that this method does not ‚Äúforce artifacts into distinct categories and distorts their true phylogenetic relationships‚Äù (O‚ÄôBrien and Lyman 2000). O‚ÄôBrien and Lyman (2003) state that employing cladistics methods is also necessary if one is trying to explain the archaeological record accurately.O‚ÄôBrien, M. J. & Lyman, R. L.(2003) Cladistics and archaeology. University of Utah Press. They have conducted successful research ‚Äúusing a phylogenetic analysis of 621 Paleo-Indian projectile points from the Southeastern United StatesO‚ÄôBrien, M. J., Darwent, J. & Lyman, R. L. (2001) Cladistics is useful for reconstructing archaeological phylogenies:Palaeoindian points from the southeastern United States. Journal of Archaeological Science 28:1115‚Äì36. and Tehrani and Collard (2002) used similar methods to reconstruct the history of Turkmen textile pattern‚Äù. However, they acknowledge the application of phylogenetics in archaeology is no different than in paleobiology therefore one can expect similar problems to arise, such as distinguishing between homologies and analogies. =Neutral Drift Model= Another approach in evolutionary archaeology is the adaptation of neutral drift models from evolutionary biology (example,Crow & Kimura (1970)Crow, J. F. & Kimura, M. (1970) An introduction to population genetics theory. Harper & Row. to account for ‚Äústylistic variation‚Äù in artifacts (Mesoudi, 2006). Neiman (1995), used a model that incorporated the selectively neutral but opposing forces of drift and innovation to show changes in ornamental styles of Illinois Woodland ceramic, while Bentley and Shennan (2003) ‚Äúfound that the frequencies of West German pottery decorations over the course of 400 years can be predicted by a similar model of unbiased cultural transmission, with some anti-conformist bias in later period‚Äù.Bentley, R. A. & Shennan, S. J. (2003) Cultural transmission and stochastic network growth. American Antiquity 68:459 ‚Äì 85. =Criticisms= The main criticism of the EA is that one cannot use biological terminology and simply apply it to other disciplines, such as anthropology and specifically archaeology. In other words, critics claim that there is no value of this approach and words such as ‚Äòvariation‚Äô, ‚Äòselection‚Äô and ‚Äòdrift‚Äô are merely metaphorical. They state no scientific methods exist that can justify employing the theory of evolution that exists in biology and paleobiology to what is observed in the social world. Another criticism is that human culture is increasingly complex and variable thus it can‚Äôt be constrained to the same theoretical notions such evolutionary biology. In addition, critics such as, Bloch 2000;Bloch, M. (2000) A well-disposed social anthropologist‚Äôs problems with memes. In: Darwinizing culture, ed. R. Aunger, pp. 189 ‚Äì 204. Oxford University Press. Pinker 1997Pinker, S. (1997) How the mind works. W. W. Norton. blatantly reject any evolutionary analysis of culture. The use of phylogenetics and cladistics also is an issue because it is quite difficult to account for distinct ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù in cultural artifacts, as O‚ÄôBrien & Lyman (2003) state. The counterargument is that just as biologist struggled with this notion, it did not prevent them from ‚Äúproducing valuable work using the character concept‚Äù (Wagner 2000). Ultimately, biological and cultural change share many similarities, yet the two frameworks are still not identical, therefore researcher must be advised that these biological models ‚Äúcannot and should not be unthinkingly applied to cultural phenomena without careful consideration of any potential differences‚Äù Plotkin, H. C. (2002b) The imagined world made real. Penguin. (Plotkin 2002b).  Evolutionary Ecology  Evolutionary Ecology also employs Darwinian properties; however natural selection is involved in the development of the cognitive process that led humans to be able to make fitness enhancing decisions. Archaeologist who utilized EE, use adaptive design as a starting point to create and test models by incorporating optimization goals, currencies and constraints (Boone & Smith 1998). EE emphasizes the importance of understanding changing cultural traditions (Shennan 2008). According to Boone and Smith (1998) EE applies phenotypic variation in a more accurate approach. They claim that humans have been designed by the processes of selection to make adaptive changes to their phenotypes. This phenotypic variation results from ‚Äúgenetically and/or culturally evolved mechanisms and variable conditions (Boone and Smith, 1998). Therefore, they claim that the only role natural selection plays in and EE framework is in the development of the cognitive process that allow humans to make adaptive decisions, and respond to variable environments. They also, mention that environment is one of the driven factors in prompting variation among humans. In other words, humans have ‚Äúproblem-solving abilities at various levels such as physiological, morphological, behavioral and scales‚Äù (Boone and Smith, 1998). This is based on a notion referred to as phenotypic plasticity, essentially phenotypes under the EE approach can respond to varying environmental conditions. What is important to gather is,that by applying an EE analysis to anthropological and archaeological phenomena, it allows researchers to employ phenotypic plasticity to the explanations of human behavior. By doing so, this explanatory framework gives humans the cognitive abilities to ‚Äúadapt to change quicker that they could through natural selection acting on genetic variation‚Äù (Boone and Smith, 1998) Evolutionary ecology assumes that ‚Äúbehavioral variation itself is not the direct product of natural selection, rather, selection enters the explanation only indirectly, as the process that designed the behaving organism (or in fact its ancestors) to respond facultatively and adaptively to particular environmental conditions‚Äù (Boone and Smith, 1998).

Sino-Babylonianism is a scholarly theory that in the third millennium B.C.E. the Babylonian region provided the essential elements of material civilization and language to what is now China. Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1845‚Äì1894) first proposed that a massive migration brought the basic elements of early civilization to China, but in this original form the theory was largely discredited. In the early 20th century, Sinocentric arguments, sometimes based on Hua‚ÄìYi distinction appealed to Chinese intellectuals who wanted to believe that the Yellow Emperor and other figures were historical, not myths. Others reacted to the extent of denying that there were foreign elements in early China.

No Sinologist who has studied the subject has been able to ascertain any other origin for the Chinese than one from the West. It is through the N.W. of China proper that they have gradually invaded the country, and that their present greatness began from very small beginnings some forty centuries ago. Lacouperie claimed that the Yellow Emperor was an historical Mesopotamian tribal leader who led a massive migration of his people into China around 2300 BC and founded what later became Chinese civilization. He further claimed a similarity between the trigrams and hexagrams in the ancient Chinese text, the Yijing, and Mesopotamian hieroglyphs. These theories of the Mesopotamian origins of Chinese civilization were supported by the Assyriologist Archibald Sayce in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. They impressed the public but were criticised or dismissed by sinologists then and later. James Legge, whose still-admired translations of the Chinese Classics appeared at the same time as Lacouperie's, questioned Lacouperie's sinological competence. Legge's review of Terrien's translation of the I Ching charged that only \\"hasty ignorance\\" could have led to the mistakes in the translation, which included failing to consult the basic reference, the Kangxi Dictionary. Another reviewer labelled Lacouperie a \\"specious wonder-monger\\". But the final blow to Lacouperie's comparativist theories came when the University of Leiden sinologist, Gustav Schlegel dismissed his claims and insisted on the independent origin and autonoumous growth of Chinese civilisation. Schlegel set the tone for later Orientalists. Scholars went on to point out that monosyllabic Chinese characters could not be equated to polysyllabic Chaldean words used in Bablylon; that in any case, knowledge of ancient Assyria was \\"dangerously uncertain\\" and too unreliable to make such claims; and that it had not even been established that Babylonian civilization was earlier than Chinese.Norman J. Girardot, The Victorian Translation of China: James Legge's Oriental Pilgrimage (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 388‚Äì390. Girardot describes the controversies in detail, pp. 382‚Äì393. Lacouperie's theory on the Babylonion origins of the Chinese sixty year ganzhi cyclical calendar system fared little better. Scholars pointed out that the two systems differed both in concept and function: the Babylonion decimal system was used to count up to 60, where the cycle started again, while the Chinese system combined a cycle of twelve and a cycle of ten.Endymion Wilkinson, Chinese History: A New Manual (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2013), pp. 497‚Äì498. Reception of Lacouperie in Asia The theory of a Western origin for Chinese civilization reached Japan and was introduced into China in an extensive summary in Chinese by Shirakawa Jiro and Kokubu Tanenori which omitted the academic refutation. The theory was known as Xilai Shuo (Ë•øÊù•ËØ¥). European sinologists found Lacouperie's evidence flimsy and reasoning faulty, but these criticisms were omitted from the 1900 presentation of Lacouperie's views, which seemed the most advanced Western scholarship on China. Chinese scholars of the time were eager to find ancient roots for the Chinese nation and to believe that the Yellow Emperor and other ancient figures were historical, not mythical. They were quickly attracted by \\"the historicization of Chinese mythology\\" that the two Japanese authors advocated. Some Chinese revolutionary nationalists welcomed Lacouperie's picture of the Han race as ancient and civilized in contrast to the Manchus who had conquered China. They interpreted Lacouperie as supporting their anti-Manchu racist theories founded on recent translations of Herbert Spencer.Charlotte Furth, \\"Intellectual Change, 1895‚Äì1920,in The scholar Zhang Taiyan used Sino-Babylonianism and the newly introduced theory of social evolution to explain how the arrival of agricultural technology from Western Asia combined with the patrilineal family system of East Asia to transform China from a hunting-gathering society into a feudalistic state that controlled a complex agrarian economy. In the 1920s, the discovery of Neolithic sites revived interest in Western connections with Chinese civilization. Scholars such as Gu Jiegang successfully attacked Lacouperie's theories and their Chinese supporters, but the Yellow Emperor retained his appeal as the progenitor of the Han race. Later theories Scholars remained skeptical of Sino-Babylonianism in its original or narrow form but continued to explore the idea of the mixture of indigenous and pan- Eurasian elements in early Chinese culture. Ellsworth Huntington and Carl Whiting Bishop, writing in the 1920s and 1930s, applied the theories of hyperdiffusionism to China, arguing that all the basic elements of early civilization developed in western Asia and diffused to the other parts of the continent, including China. The historian Ping-ti Ho was among the Chinese scholars who reacted to Sino-Babylonianism by asserting that all the important elements of early Chinese civilization were indigenous and developed in what is now China. Ho, Ping-ti.The Cradle Of The East: An Inquiry Into The Indigenous Origins Of Techniques And Ideas Of Neolithic And Early Historic China, 5000-1000 B.C. (Hongkong: Chinese University Press, 1975). The scholars J.P. Mallory and Victor Mair made a series of arguments that resembled parts of the theory. They pointed to the mummies excavated in Tarim Basin in Chinese Central Asia that date from 1800 BCE to the first centuries BCE. These had bodily features that were Caucasoid rather than Chinese. They concede that scholars argue whether the earliest bronze technology in China was stimulated by contacts with western steppe cultures, but they conclude that the evidence favours the hypothesis. The Sinologist John Didier made an extensive investigation of what he calls the \\"interactive Eurasian world, c. 9000‚Äì500 BC,\\" that is, the mutual ties between ancient East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle-East, including Persia and Babylon. These exchanges, he argues, shaped the foundations and early evolution of East Asian technology, cosmology, religion, myth, rulership, divination, and literacy. Didier provides examples of the Middle Eastern origin or inspiration of astronomical systems and calendars, religious figures such as the Yellow Emperor, and religious myths based on astrological observation shared across the continent. In 2016, Sun Weidong, a Chinese geochemist argued that the founders of Chinese civilization migrated from Egypt and were therefore not actually Chinese. He was led to this hypothesis when his radiometric dating of ancient Chinese bronzes found that their chemical composition was more similar to ancient Egyptian bronzes than to ores found in China. Sun went on to argue that the technology of Bronze Age widely thought to have come across Central Asia by land had in fact been brought by the Hyksos, a Western Asian people who settled in the Nile Valley in the 17th and 16th centuries B.C.E. and may have fled by sea when their dynasty collapsed. The technologies that the Hyskos had earlier developed -- bronze metallurgy, chariots, literacy, domesticated plants and animals -- were precisely those that have been excavated at the Shang dynasty capital, Yinxu.

The song was first recorded and released by Lee Chien-Fu (), and Hou himself also recorded the song. It has been covered by other artists, including Lee's nephew Wang Leehom. The song became an anthem in the 1980s, and it is commonly regarded as a patriotic song that expresses sentiments of Chinese nationalism. Background The song was written in late 1978 by Taiwanese songwriter Hou Dejian while still a student, initially as a protest against United States' official diplomatic recognition of People's Republic of China, a decision first announced on December 15, 1978. The song was first recorded by Lee Chien-Fu while he was a second-year university student in Taiwan. The song was released in 1980 and became highly successful in Taiwan as a nationalistic anthem. It stayed top in the list of the most popular songs of Minsheng newspaper for fifteen weeks. Hou later emigrated to mainland China in 1983, where the song also became popular, and it was interpreted as a pan-Chinese call for unification. It became at one time the most popular pop song ever released in China. Hou however was surprised that the song was used as an expression of pro-China sentiment, and said: \\"You have totally misread my intention!\\" In 1989, Hou supported the students during the Tiananmen Square protests. The song became popular with the protesters, and it was adopted as an anthem for the movement together with \\"The Internationale\\" and Cui Jian's \\"I Have Nothing\\". Hou was later expelled from China for his support of the protests, his song was nevertheless praised for its expression of patriotism in China and continued to be used in state broadcast and official occasions. The song was promoted by both the governments of Taiwan and mainland China. It has been noted in its assertion of racial and cultural identity of Chineseness. Lyrics The song states that China is the dragon, and Chinese people the \\"Descendants of the Dragon\\". Although the use of Chinese dragon as a motif has a long history, using dragon to represent the Chinese people only became popular since the 1970s. During the pre-modern dynastic periods, the dragon were often associated with the rulers of China and used as a symbol of imperial rule, and there were strict stipulations on the use of the dragon by commoners since the Yuan dynasty. Although the Qing government used the dragon as its imperial symbol on the flag of China, it was only during the early Republican era that the dragon began to be used to represent Chinese civilisation. The song begins by mentioning the great rivers of China, Yangtze and Yellow River, and that they are part of the cultural memories the songwriter. It relates that while the songwriter was born \\"under the feet of the dragon\\", he shares with the people of China the same genetic and cultural heritage and identity. The original lyrics contain a reference to the Opium War, and convey a sense of grievance against unnamed outside enemies. Originally the lyrics described \\"Westerners\\" () as the enemy, but this was changed to \\"appeasers\\" () on publication. The song ends by exhorting the \\"great dragon\\", i.e. China, to open its eyes to see and regain its greatness. Hou made two changes to the lyrics at a concert in Hong Kong in support of the students during the Tiananmen protest of 1989: in the line \\"surrounded on all sides by the appeasers' swords\\" (), \\"appeasers\\" () was replaced with \\"dictators\\" (); and the line \\"black hair, black eyes, yellow skin\\" () was changed to \\"Whether you are willing or not\\" () to reflect the fact that not all Chinese people have such physical characteristics. Covers A version of the song was recorded by Hong Kong singer Cheung Ming- man. Lee Chien-Fu's nephew Wang Leehom recorded a version of song in 2000, but modified the lyrics to add his parents' experience as immigrants in the US, which replaced the reference to the Opium War. Wang said the song is the only Chinese pop song he heard while growing up in the States when his uncle Lee paid a visit in the 1980s and played the song.

The documentary is divided into five parts with each section focusing on a different subject. The five parts are: 1) The Company, 2) The Deep State, 3) The Strategy of Tension, 4) Necrophilous, and 5) Drone Nation.  The Company  One of the main topics discussed in this section of the documentary is plausible deniability, and how high officials are able to claim it by being kept out of the loop on certain topics. Within a few years of its creation, the CIA become one of the most powerful institutions within the United States. After its creation the National Security Council passed a law that allowed the CIA to conduct programs that were officially nonexistent and therefore bypassed needing congressional approval. The National Security Council ordered these programs to be \\"planned and executed that any US Government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the US Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them.\\" This gave the United States and the top leaders the ability to disavow that certain actions were done at the behest of the president himself. By doing this, there was no connection between the United States government and the acts that were to occur.  The Deep State  The second section of the documentary focuses on the incarceration of people for profit and the expanding prison population of which the majority are incarcerated for drug related crimes. This section also looks at the \\"War on Drugs\\" and the criminal networks that have been involved in it for example mafias and gangs. Colombia is mentioned when discussing \\"The War on Drugs\\" due to the drug trafficking that occurs in the state and the fighting that happens because of the trafficking. The documentary also mentions how the drug trafficking affects the people of Colombia.  The Strategy of Tension  The third section of the documentary discusses the history of false flag operations that were used for propaganda, war, and psychological operations, also known as \\"psy-ops\\". Two examples that are given in this portion of the documentary are Operation Northwoods and Operation Gladio. These operations are used to show the clandestine nature of the planning and execution of operations.  Necrophilous  The fourth portion of the documentary examines torture, war crimes, and the abuses of authority that occur during times of protest and war. This section of the documentary discusses the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the effects that those attacks had on the people. The documentary also discusses other scenarios that the U.S. could have pursued when planning the bombings, and the possible outcomes of those scenarios are also discussed. Ultimately the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the final decisions on that matter.  Drone Nation  The fifth and final portion of the documentary discusses the 2011 NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act. In 2011, the act was changed from only applying to \\"Enemy Combatants\\" to American citizens themselves. The Act allows for U.S. citizens in addition to enemy combatants to be arrested on American soil and to be detained for an indefinite amount of time.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ81/pdf/PLAW-112publ81.pdf This section of the documentary looks at how the U.S. gets intelligence of \\"enemy combatants\\" and how drones are used.

They exhibited together for three years starting in 1929. Although each artist had an individual style, they were linked together by the influence of Parisian post-impressionism and fauvism, including the work of Amedeo Modigliani, and their anti-fascist ideology ‚Äì a position that set them apart from other movements like Novecento Italiano and Futurism. The six artists in the group were: * Jessie Boswell (Leeds, 1881 - Moncrivello, 1956), * Gigi Chessa (Turin, 1898 - Turin, 1935), * Nicola Galante, (Vasto, 1883 - Turin, 1969), * Carlo Levi (Turin, 1902 - Rome, 1975), * Francesco Menzio (Turin, 1899 - Turin, 1979), * Enrico Paulucci Delle Roncole (Genoa, 1901 - Turin, 1999). Their association was championed by art critics like Edoardo Persico and Lionello Venturi and contemporary art collector Riccardo Gualino who, together with his wife, had purchased a theater in Turin where he was endorsing avante garde music concerts, dances, art events and plays. The six artists first exhibited together in the spring of 1929 at Galleria Guglielmi in Turin. In November the same year they had two other shows at Circolo della Stampa in Genoa and at Galleria Bardi in Milan (later to be known as Galleria Il Milione). A combination of personal and political disagreements eventually contributed to split the group apart, along with Gualino's decision to withdraw his financial support following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and his being put under house arrest by Benito Mussolini's government.

It was published in England by Hodder and Stoughton in 1948 and in the United States by Harper & Brothers in 1949 as He Didn't Mind Danger. It was Gilbert's first publication in the States. It is also the second novel to feature Gilbert's earliest recurring character, Inspector Hazlerigg. Gilbert, who was appointed CBE in 1980, was a founder- member of the British Crime Writers' Association. The Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master in 1988 and in 1990 he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award. Plot and title(s)  The events take place mostly in post-World War II London, in either 1945 and '46 or 1946 and '47‚Äîit is difficult to put an exact date on them‚Äîand in one extended scene in France. They are told by an omniscient third-person narrator but most of the scenes involve either Inspector Hazlerigg and the workings of the Metropolitan police department or the activities of a recently mustered-out Army veteran, Major Angus McMann. It was the first of a number of novels Gilbert would write over his exceptionally long career in which organized gangs and criminal masterminds figure, both in London and, less often, in Europe. The war has ended but a large number of British troops are still stationed in Europe. Adapting the techniques and brutality of pre-war American gangs, a British crime leader who keeps his identity unknown by his ingenious use of middlemen has organized both ordinary criminal figures and newly discharged British soldiers into a profitable scheme involving both burglaries and currency smuggling. Gold and jewelry are stolen throughout England; some is smuggled to Europe by British soldiers returning to the Continent from leave. Some is melted down and recast as counterfeit gold sovereigns, which are in great demand throughout Europe and can be sold for immense profits. Other British soldiers are also being used to smuggle valuable jewelry from Europe into England, where it can be sold profitably. It is this organization that Hazlerigg and his counterparts in France and Italy have been desperately trying to shut down. Major McMann, now living temporarily at his elderly sister's home, tells Hazlerigg at their initial meeting, \\"I'm at a loose end. I live in London, and I don't mind work.\\" And, as the author adds, \\"He didn't mind danger, either, but he didn't say so.\\" The British title of the book is apparently derived from the fact that the British soldiers who ferry jewels and sovereigns back and forth across the Channel do so with such ingeniously crafted items as false-bottomed canteens that they never looked inside them. Reception Upon its publication in the United States Anthony Boucher, the mystery critic of the New York Times, called it \\"a convincing and warmly realistic suspense story,\\" and added that it was \\"a first novel to make you look forward hopefully to more Michael Gilbert.\\" Criminals at Large, 20 July 1949, The New York Times at A few years later, however, although still admiring it, he said it was \\"a Manning Coles novel of blithe adventure\\"Criminals at Large, 6 January 1952, The New York Times at By the time he wrote this, Coles had cemented his reputation for writing rather light-hearted suspense/espionage novels involving somewhat implausible escapes from danger by his on-going hero, Tommy Hambledon. Style and contents The style is, in actuality, a combination of both the tones that Boucher mentions. Gilbert, still a relatively inexperienced writer, had not yet found the authorial voice he would later use so successfully for many years, a style that was spare and unadorned but was also urbane and straightforward, mixing occasional ironic humor with a surprising amount of underlying grimness. Gilbert had attended Blundell's School, a notable British public school, and after graduating from college was a schoolmaster in a prep school for a while before the war. A number of his books and stories are set in boys' schools and, unusually for a crime writer, he frequently has teenage boys as important characters in many of his works. In this novel several of them have roles, this time as part of the criminal underground, although they are mostly older than the somewhat younger boys that Gilbert normally depicts. Credibility As in many crime or mystery stories, the likelihood of some of the events in the narrative cannot withstand prolonged scrutiny. Aside from the somewhat unlikely amateur sleuthing by various friends of Major McMann that brings to light important leads overlooked by the best minds of Scotland Yard, it also strains credibility that the sinister \\"Mr. Brown\\", the secretive mastermind who directs an enormous criminal enterprise, both in England and abroad, and who has hitherto shown utter ruthlessness in dispatching both suspected informers and police spies within his organization, going so far as to personally torture and kill the undercover policeman Sergeant Pollock, first captures, and then releases, Major McMann when it is obvious that McMann has been tracking one of his underlings. Held in circumstances that make escape clearly impossible, McMann is not even interrogated by Mr. Brown; instead, he is simply released because a low-ranking member of the gang, who had served in the Army directly under McMann, vouches for him. Otherwise, Gilbert's description of the organization and ruthlessness of the gang seems grimly realistic and quite feasible. And, in the end, it is the enormous organizational firepower of government forces, not the doings of a gifted amateur, that eventually brings Mr. Brown to justice.

It is named after the discoverer of the Ghost Ranch quarry, George O. Whitaker. The fossil was described in 2007.  Features  The left and right dentary are preserved, along with a fragmentary left maxilla and probable palatal bone, on two blocks of stone. = Dentary bones = The left dentary is fragmented but still has almost all teeth present, whereas the right dentary is incomplete and has most of the teeth. The left dentary is 11 mm long and has multiple broken teeth or tooth positions. The coronid process is missing, but there may be a suture present where the dentary was joined to the surangular. A small groove is present on the lingual side of teeth 16-18. The right dentary is only partial, unlike the left dentary where all the fragments are present, but the piece preserved is 9 mm long. The posterior teeth are displaced ventrally, but at least 16 teeth are present, probably 18. The right dentary also shows the presence of at least five nutrient foramina ventral to the teeth. = Maxilla = This is less than 2 mm long, but contains four relatively large teeth, probably posterior. = Palatal bone = This is a very thin element, resembling an extremely thin plate of bone. There are six teeth here, arranged in a single line. It is probably either the palatine or pterygoid bone, and closely resembles the pterygoid of Clevosaurus. The whole element is approximately 2 mm long. =Dentition= Like its relatives Planocephalosaurus and Diphydontosaurus, Whitakersaurus possesses a mix of dental implantations. It is posteriorly acrodont, after the ninth tooth, and anteriorly pleurodont. There are 19 teeth on each side of the lower jaw, which are heterodont. The first 14 teeth are small and peg-like, and the last 5 teeth are much larger and laterally compressed. The teeth gradually increase in size posteriorly, with teeth 11-14 being twice as large as teeth 1-4, and teeth 17&19 being twice as large as teeth 11-14. However, teeth 16 and 18 are very small compared to teeth 17 and 19, which does correspond with the tooth development of other sphenodonts. The large posterior teeth are slightly conical and striated. The maxillary teeth are acrodont, large, and striated. They are taller than long, laterally compressed, and are almost all broken. The complete one is slightly curved towards the others, whereas two of the incomplete teeth here are so close that their bases touch. The palatal teeth have tiny crowns, are in a single row, and are arranged regularly. They are a little taller than the plate of bone is thick.  Significance  The very small size of the Whitakersaurus fossil suggests that it may have been a juvenile, although the characteristic 'hatchling dentition' that would normally be found here is only present for the last two teeth. It is also not that much smaller than many other sphenodontians. It has fewer dentary teeth than many of its relatives, and fewer of them are pleurodont. Whitakersaurus is significant because, as well as being the most complete rhynchocephalian from the Chinle Group, it has many primitive features indicating it is a relatively basal sphenodont, but also a few more derived features. This indicates that primitive and derived lineages of rhynchocephalian radiated across the world before Whitakersaurus evolved, possibly showing an early radiative event.

To date, Trump has been portrayed by five SNL performers: Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, Jason Sudeikis, Taran Killam, and Alec Baldwin. Hammond has portrayed him the longest, originally while in the cast in the late 1990s, and then reprising the role in a series of cameos in 2016. The other cast-members held the role briefly, with five appearances by Hartman, three by Killam, and only one by Sudeikis. Since October 2016, the role has been played by Baldwin, who has made many appearances on the series through its run. SNL has frequently paired parodies of Trump with impressions of his wives and children or, since he took office, various staff-members. Trump himself has hosted the show twice, in 2004 and 2015, the latter time as a presidential candidate. Hartman parodies (1988‚Äì1990) Cast member Phil Hartman was the show's first portrayer of Donald Trump, from 1988 until 1990. Hartman portrayed Trump five times, and was paired with Jan Hooks as Trump's then-wife Ivana Trump or, in one case, Marla Maples, Trump's second-wife-to- be. The first sketch, from December 1988, shows Donald and Ivana celebrating Christmas, giving large, gold and jewel-encrusted presents to each other. Trump is seen in the audience at the Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Special from 1989, where Chevy Chase spills popcorn on him. A sketch from February 1990 parodies the Ivana Trump divorce. Ivana demands more money since Donald has been unfaithful, but he refutes this by referring to their extensive prenuptial agreement. It states, among other things, that he is entitled to have mistresses provided they are younger than she is, and that she will be paid in giant stonecoins. The next episode had Marla Maples and Trump appearing on Church Chat. The couple are referred to as a \\"satanic sandwich\\", and the sketch shows press coverage of their relationship, including a \\"Best Sex I've Ever Had\\" headline. Hammond parodies (1999‚Äì2011, 2015‚Äì2016) Hartman did not appear in Trump-sketches after 1990, and Darrell Hammond's first two portrayals came in 1999. The first sketch had Ross Perot (Cheri Oteri) searching for \\"a new crazy leader\\" for the Reform Party, with Trump and Pat Buchanan (Chris Parnell) as possible candidates. Their meeting is crashed by a violent Jesse Ventura (Will Ferrell). In the second sketch, Trump announces that he is running for president and tells the audience, \\"Eh, don't try to fight it. Alright?\\" He also introduces his running mate, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? winner John Carpenter. Hammond resumed playing Trump in 2004, doing so a total of 16 times up to 2011, although he left the cast in 2009. His parodies focused on Trump's interest and involvement with politics, commercials, and his appearances on The Apprentice. Trump hosted the show in April 2004, praising Hammond in his opening monologue and appeared in a sketch next to Hammond's Trump. An early 2005 episode introduced Trump's third wife, Melania (Paris Hilton). Trump brings her home to let his children, Eric Trump (Fred Armisen), Donald Trump Jr. (Seth Meyers), and Ivanka Trump (Maya Rudolph), \\"meet their new mommy\\". Melania would be portrayed later by Molly Shannon and, from 2015 and onward (without Hammond), by Cecily Strong. Hammond is the show's longest-running Trump impersonator. He played the role for ten years in the cast, 1999 to 2009, and reprised it twice in 2011. In the 2011 sketches Trump involves himself in the upcoming Republican Party presidential primaries and questions President Obama's birth certificate. After returning to serve as the show's announcer in 2014, he began reprising his role as Trump regularly, beginning in December 2015. Due to the wide field of GOP candidates in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the show needed at least one cameo appearance to cover all of the candidates. Taran Killam, who at this point had begun playing Trump, switched to portraying Ted Cruz. SNL had asked alumnus Jimmy Fallon (who had portrayed Trump on his own show) to play the part. When a last minute change prevented this, Hammond returned to the role. Cecily Strong, who had portrayed Melania opposite Killam's Trump, continued in this role alongside Hammond. Hammond subsequently appeared as Trump in seven more episodes of the season. His appearance in the role was critically acclaimed, but some outlets reported that the role should be moved to a permanent cast member at some point. Sudeikis parody (2012) Jason Sudeikis appeared in the role once, during a Fox & Friends parody. Sudeikis' Trump comments on Barack Obama's handling of Hurricane Sandy. Killam parodies (2015) It was announced prior to the show's forty-first season that Taran Killam would be taking over the role for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Reportedly, several cast members had auditioned for the role. Killam's Trump debuted on the October 2015 sketch \\"A Message From Donald & Melania Trump\\", which also introduced Cecily Strong as Melania Trump. The message is sent from \\"our humble gold house\\", and Donald presents himself as \\"the man who's almost certainly your next president\\". The couple praise Donald's qualities as a person and a politician, although he becomes uncomfortable when she claims that he \\"was Democrat before he was Republican\\". The duo reprised the setup and characters in December, wishing viewers a Merry Christmas and presenting a \\"Naughty and Nice\\" list. Donald placed Santa on the \\"naughty\\" list since he does not trust anybody who can fly over a wall. Donald Trump hosted SNL a second time in November 2015, and Killam and Hammond appeared during the opening monologue alongside him. Since Trump was running for president, his appearance triggered the equal-time rule, so his opponents received free air time on NBC affiliate stations. Trump appeared in a sketch portraying him as an incredibly successful president in 2018. Cecily Strong parodied Melania, and Trump's daughter Ivanka appeared in a cameo. Trump ends the sketch by telling the audience that his actual presidency would be even better. Trump is one of 17 presidential candidates who have appeared on Saturday Night Live, and the only American President to have hosted the show.Serico, Chris. Star-spangled laughter: 17 presidential candidates who appeared on 'SNL'. TODAY. November 6, 2015. Web. Retrieved July 26, 2017. Killam later expressed regret and shame for what he referred to as \\"normalizing\\" Trump's candidacy.Sanders, Sam. \\"Taran Killam Says 'There Was Never Any Common Ground' When Trump Hosted 'SNL.'\\" NPR. October 17, 2017. October 17, 2017. For the December 19, 2015 episode, SNL lacked enough cast members to portray all of the GOP candidates in a debate sketch. As a result, Jimmy Fallon was asked to return in the role of Trump (which he had played many times on The Tonight Show) so that Killam could portray Ted Cruz instead. Ultimately, that plan fell through at the last minute, and instead, Hammond played Trump in the debate. Hammond continued to play Trump for the remainder of the season. Killam's contract was terminated early after that season, with some news sources alleging that being replaced as Trump was part of the reason. Baldwin parodies (2016‚Äìpresent) In September 2016, SNL announced that Alec Baldwin would replace Hammond in portraying Trump in its parodies of the 2016 presidential debates. Hammond had not expected this, and was very shaken by the replacement. Baldwin has continued portraying Trump as of 2020. Unlike his predecessors, he has never been a cast-member, but as of February 2017 he has hosted the show 17 times, more than anyone else. Baldwin received a Critics' Choice Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for his portrayal of Trump. =Before election= Baldwin's Trump debuted in the October 1, 2016 episode, opposite Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton and Michael Che as debate moderator Lester Holt. The sketch was based on the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump. The episode also included impressions of members of Trump's family in a parody of the game show Family Feud. Further sketches with Baldwin included elements of the other presidential debates, the vice presidential debate, and the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording controversy. The October 15 episode featured a parody of the third presidential debate. Later in the episode, Baldwin and Cecily Strong appeared as Donald and Melania Trump, in a parody of Beyonc√©'s Lemonade. Host Emily Blunt portrayed Ivanka Trump, and Vanessa Bayer appeared as Trump's youngest daughter Tiffany Trump. Trump reacted negatively to this episode on Twitter, saying that Baldwin's portrayal \\"stinks\\", and that it was \\"time to retire the boring and unfunny show.\\" =After election= Post-election sketches have included Baldwin's Trump meeting with people such as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mitt Romney (Jason Sudeikis), and Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennett), with humor drawn from the 2016 United States election interference by Russia. In February 2017, it was reported that the show has had strong viewer ratings since the election. Several people who work closely with Trump have been frequently parodied. These include Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon), White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon (Mikey Day) with a Grim Reaper-like appearance, White House Press Secretaries Sean Spicer (Melissa McCarthy), and Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant), and United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions (Kate McKinnon). Vice President Mike Pence is portrayed by Beck Bennett, and Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. by Alex Moffat and Mikey Day respectively. Elder daughter Ivanka Trump has also been featured, as portrayed by Scarlett Johansson, though she has also been portrayed by Margot Robbie. Other parodies of people associated with the Trump Administration post-election include Jared Kushner (Jimmy Fallon), an unmasked Steve Bannon (Bill Murray), Michael Cohen (Ben Stiller), Brett Kavanaugh (Matt Damon), Robert Mueller (Robert de Niro), Rudy Giuliani (Kate McKinnon), Paul Manafort (Alex Moffat), and Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett). Trump tweeted his displeasure with the show in November, December, and January, saying \\"Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse.\\" and \\"NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!\\". In January 2017, SNL writer Katie Rich was suspended from the show after she wrote a joking tweet saying that Trump's youngest son, Barron, would become \\"this country's first home school shooter.\\" The tweet provoked significant outrage, and Rich apologized, calling it \\"inexcusable\\". El Nacional, a Dominican newspaper, mistakenly published Baldwin's picture instead of Trump's in February 2017. The paper quickly apologized.

The war saw two factions, a conservative side supported by the political, economic and religious elite of the country with control of the armed forces and who defended a unitary state, and a liberal faction opposed to the policies set by the state and that intended to transform the country into a federation, with support of the peasantry, the indigenous peoples and small Catholic businesses. The conflict was ultimately won by the liberal side, putting an end to decades-long political rule by the Bolivian conservatives and leading to a time of political change called the federal revolution (Spanish: revoluci√≥n federal). The outcome included the attempted move of the country's capital city from Sucre to La Paz, however subsequent political conflicts challenged this process eventually frustrating a complete move and also hindering the transformation into a federal republic. In consequence Sucre remained the constitutional capital, whereas La Paz became the de facto seat of government, a situation that remains in present time. During the war, both sides committed atrocities against the civilian populace. Within the territory controlled by each faction, a surge of revolutions and counter-revolution further complicated the everyday lives of civilians. In addition, foreign interests were also present, as the liberals had strong links with Peru and the conservatives with Chile. The post-war period was marked by the general disillusionment at the Federal Government Junta, created after the war by members of the liberal faction. While the Junta did conduct some political reforms, it largely continued the political foundations of its predecessors, including preserving the unitary state and rejecting any possibility of establishing a federal or confederal state. Additionally, the new government did not uphold the promises made to the rural and indigenous classes, and protests by them were responded with oppression and executions. The most significant execution of this period was that of Pablo Z√°rate Wilka, an indigenous leader who had proved to be the biggest ally of the liberal faction during the war. The political consequences of the civil war continued on during the 20th century, as its ideological bases served as foundations for subsequent political upheaval, such as the Bolivian revolution of 1952.  Background  After the defeat at the Battle of Tacna in May of 1880, Bolivia retreated from the War of the Pacific and the political elite became divided into two factions; the guerristas, who sought to resume military confrontation to at least recover some form of access to the Pacific Ocean, and the pacifistas who supported a final end to the conflict and a treaty with Chile. The former were mostly groups with strong links to the military and with commercial interests with Peru, whereas the latter were big landowners from southern Bolivia who benefitted from peace with Chile. The guerristas and pacifistas were the immediate precursors to the Conservative and Liberal parties, respectively. The liberals were led by Eliodoro Camacho, a noted politician and veteran of the Pacific War, while the conservatives moved around the figures of Aniceto Arce, Gregorio Pacheco and Mariano Baptista, all linked to the mining industry. The victory of Pacheco in the general elections of 1883 and the pressure of the mine owners of southern Bolivia led to the signing of the Treaty of Valparaiso with Chile on 4 April, 1884, which gave the heretofore Bolivian Antofagasta Province to Chile. The loss of any direct access to the sea was a heavy blow to the criollo commercial elite, as it limited the commercial opportunities of the country. The conservatives would hold political power for several successive terms: Pacheco (1884-1888), Arce (1888-1892), Baptista (1892-1896). In the general election of 1896, Severo Fern√°ndez was elected president. Each political faction became strong regionally, the liberals held political power and influence in the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba and Oruro, whereas the conservatives were strong in the mining regions of Sucre and Potos√≠. Among the liberals there were members of the emerging commercial and industrial bourgeoisie, academics, lawyers and writers, whereas the conservatives were most of all bankers, members of the political elite, aristocrats, big landowners and clergy. The frequent abuse of power by the conservative authorities and the expansion of big landowners in the rural areas at the expense of the traditional indigenous communities increased popular support for the liberals, particularly among the Aymara ayllu communities of the Altiplano. The liberal leaders promised a reversal of the Agrarian Law of 1874 and the recovery of the lost lands, further increasing indigenous support to their cause, despite the fact that many prominent liberal figures were in fact the beneficiaries of said law. By the late 19th century, La Paz had become in the hegemomical region of the country, especially after the collapse of the gold mining industry in favour of that of tin. Lacking the mining or the agrarian resources of other regions, the economy of La Paz was more diversified, with important commercial links to Peru. Sucre, being both the capital city and a conservative stronghold benefited from significant investments, but as the economic weight of La Paz increased, the desire of its economic and political elites to control the country's finances grew bigger.  Ley Radicatoria of 1898  Palace of Government in Sucre. Severo Fern√°ndez was a conservative who had been elected president of Bolivia after the general elections of 1896. During his mandate, Fern√°ndez intended to put an end of \\"problem of the capital\\": until 1880 the seat of the executive and legislative power was located wherever the president resided. In consequence, since achieving independence in 1825 and until 1898 Congress had met 29 times in Sucre, 20 in La Paz, 7 in Oruro, 2 in Cochabamba and once in Tapacar√≠. Officially, the capital city was set in the city of Sucre, which had also been the capital of the Real Audiencia of Charcas during colonial times. The capital had not been moved due to a combination of financial challenges involved and the influence of the local aristocracy. Starting in 1880, the conservative governments started to reside permanently in Sucre, making it the de facto capital. On the 31st of October, 1898 the members of Congress in Sucre proposed a bill named ley radicatoria that effectively set the executive power in Sucre. The congress members from La Paz, however, proposed moving to the city of Cochabamba instead, as it was a more neutral choice, but the government rejected the idea. The liberals had decided to seemingly support Sucre as the capital city with the aim of provoking the La Paz elites to rebel against the conservative government. On 6 November there is a big demonstration in La Paz demanding both federalism and the definitive move of all branches of government to the city. On the 14th a Federal Committee is created, presided by the army colonel Jos√© Manuel Pando, while the liberals took advantage of the upheaval to propose full economic and political autonomy for all departments. Three days later however, the ley radicatoria was approved and Sucre was set as the only capital city of Bolivia, that was to remain a centralist, unitary state. In response, on the 12th of December, supported by the local population of La Paz, a Federal Junta made of members of the liberal party is created, effectively setting a scenario where two active governments existed in the country, one in Sucre and another in La Paz. Some political authorities recognised the political authority of the Junta, like La Paz governor Serapio Reyes Ortiz and the minister Macario Pinilla. The liberals were led by Pando, who received support from the Altiplano indigenous communities, led by the cacique Pablo Z√°rate Willka, giving way to an unprecedented situation in which a federal revolution led by criollos happened simultaneously and in alliance with an indigenous revolt.  Course of the war  = 1898 = Following the orders of the Federal Junta, the congress members from La Paz returned to the city, where they were received in clamor by the locals. The Federal Junta set as ultimate objective the establishment of a federal government and the overthrow of conservative president Severo Fern√°ndez. Meanwhile, in Sucre public demonstrations in favour of the conservative government were held. Fern√°ndez decided to march to La Paz leading three military squadrons, Bol√≠var, Jun√≠n and H√∫asares. While at Challapata the president was informed that the liberal rebels had obtained more than 2,000 weapons, making a popular resistance in the city feasible. In consequence, the conservatives asked for volunteers in Sucre to join the war efforts. The reinforcements arrived to Oruro by the 14th of December, where military preparations were set. Two brigades were created, the first one comprising the 25th of May battalion and the Sucre squadron, made up of high class men with houses and weapons of their own property. The second brigade, comprising the Ola√±eta battalion and Monteagudo squadron, was composed of lower class members. During the march to La Paz several indigenous communities were sacked. = 1899 = The first brigade met the liberal forces in Cosmini on the 24th of January, and were forced to retreat to Ayo Ayo, where they were massacred. By this time, news of the battles taking place travel across the country; the city of Potos√≠ positions itself in support of the conservative government, while the departments of eastern and southern Bolivia opt for neutrality. In the rural areas of La Paz, Cochabamba, Oruro and Potos√≠ indigenous revolts in support of the liberal side take place. The decisive battle took place in the small town of Segundo Crucero de Paria, on the 10th of April of 1899, where the conservative president Fern√°ndez and the liberal colonel Pando met face to face, with a victory of the latter after four hours of battle. After the defeat, the remaining conservative forces retreated back to Oruro, while Fern√°ndez was exiled to Chile.  Consequences  Z√°rate Willka and a group of Andean indigenous fighters. The war was the outcome of the growing tensions between the political elites of La Paz and Sucre and represented the shift in political power from the south to the north of the country and the beginning of the political and economic hegemony of La Paz. The main outcome of the war was the definite transfer of political power from Sucre to La Paz, which became the de facto seat of government. However, the liberal victory did not have any relevant social consequences, nor did it culminate in the transformation of Boliva into a federal state. After the war, the indigenous and mestizo populations of the country realised that the aristocratic criollo elites did not intend to return any lands back, and thus started an estrangement between these groups. This process had already started during the course of the war, when in many occasions indigenous squadrons disobeyed the orders of criollo leaders and committed atrocities against civilian populations. According to the 1901 census, the Bolivian population was distributed between 800,000 indigenous peoples -mostly Quechua and Aymara, 100,000 mestizos or cholos and 200,000 criollos or whites that controlled the political, cultural and economic power of the country. The criollo elite differentiated between the indigenous peoples, considering the Quechua to be more civilised than the Aymaras, who were often involved in revolts and uprisings. The criollo population feared an indigenous social revolution and thus began closing ranks to assure that political power was not lost. After the war, indigenous revolts took place demanding the upholding of the promised made by the liberals to the indigenous populations in exchange for their participation in the conflict. In response, the indigenous cacique Pablo Z√°rate Willka, who had been elevated to the rank of general in the liberal army, is arrested. Z√°rate Wilka would escape his imprisonment in 1903, but was captured again and executed without due process two years later. The indigenous people of the Altiplano were left to become once again servants (Quechua: yanakuna) for big landowners, working without pay for 3 to 5 days every week, only in exchange of being able to work during their free time and benefit from a smaller piece land that hitherto had belonged to them. The Altiplano countryside had thus re-established a semi-feudal society, where the indigenous peoples lived a community life subordinated to the norms and rulings of the landlord. The indigenous tribes of the Chaco region began to suffer the violence of the military, which supported the expansion of big farmers; many indigenous peoples, most of them Guaran√≠, were captured and forced to work on sugar cane plantations, often in conditions far worse than those of their Andean counterparts. Lastly, the indigenous peoples of the Bolivian Amazon saw their little autonomy finished after the liberal governments authorised the exploitation of their lands to produce rubber; many were captured and sold as forced laborers for the production of latex, or else were displaced from their lands by the arrival of criollo or mestizo settlers.

History  The Fontanel Mansion was built in 1988 for Barbara Mandrell and her family. The name Fontanel, which is the soft spot on a baby's head, was picked by Barbara Mandrell because she wanted this to be the \\"soft spot\\" for her family and bring them all together. The Mandrell family lived in the house from 1988 to 2002. In 2002, the Fontanel Mansion property was bought by Dale Morris and Marc Oswald, two investors. They used it to film television productions and video shoots. In June 2010, the owners made the Fontanel property into a tourist attraction. The Fontanel Mansion is located in Whites Creek, Tennessee, and has 27,000 square feet of interior space. It stands three stories and contains more than 20 rooms, 13 baths, 5 fireplaces, 2 kitchens, an indoor pool atrium that converts to a dance floor and an indoor shooting range. The mansion is one of the largest log homes in the world. The walls are filled with memorabilia from the Mandrells' family collection, including items from Alabama, Kenny Chesney, Big & Rich, Gretchen Wilson, Buck Owens, and the Eagles. Currently, the hospitality director of the Fontanel property is Jamie Dudney, Barbara Mandrell's daughter. The property now includes The Inn, Prichard's Distillery, Natchez Hills Winery, Adventureworks Ziplines, The Mansion, the Carl Black Chevy Woods Amphitheater, The Trails and Greenway, Stone House Shoppe, and Vintage Creek Boutique. Tours of the property take approximately two hours. In 2013, the Fontanel Mansion offered the Barbara Mandrell Bus Tour as a paid attraction. The vehicle is a 1993 Hemphill Brothers Eagle coach that Mandrell used during her tours, and it was subsequently acquired by the Christian rock girl band BarlowGirl. In January 2020, BarlowGirl management relisted the bus for sale. In 2016, Dale Morris became the sole owner of two-thirds of the property. He paid $9.87 million to buy out Marc Oswald. In 2016, the property owner proposed a $25 million expansion of the site's bed and breakfast inn. The plan included adding 136 rooms, a banquet and meeting hall, a pool and spa, and retail space, and would have added an additional 31 acres to the complex. Some area residents objected to the expansion, saying it would ruin the rural historic character of the area, and the project was stalled. On August 13, 2019, Fontanel management announced the property was closing \\"for the time being.\\" WZTV, August 13, 2019, 9:20 P.M. = Cultural references = The mansion can be seen in the television series Gone Country, the film Country Strong, and other photo and video shoots especially in the country music genre.About Nashville See also  * Live from the Woods at Fontanel  References  External links * Category:1987 establishments in Tennessee ","title":"Fontanel Mansion"},{"id":"51781633","text":"Alfons Bierebeek (born 10 June 1934) is a Belgian former swimmer.

Christianity has influenced some of the most influential and biggest names in Rap, including Chance the Rapper, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole. While these names, along with others do not necessarily preach Christianity, it is clear that their lyrics and themes are heavily influenced by the religion. Hip hop music refers to a genre that arose in the 1970s, and expanded into a larger culture and one of the most popular genres in the world. Rap, an essential part of Hip-Hop music, refers to the practice of speaking lyrics over a beat. Themes in Hip-Hop and Rap can involve anything, and tend to vary, but are not limited, by the region from which the rapper originates. Los Angeles, and more specifically, Compton rappers, including 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, YG, and Kendrick Lamar, tend to fall under the category of \\"gangsta\\" rap, speaking on themes of violence, as well as partying in the inner city. However, New York rappers, such as Notorious B.I.G., Nas, and Joey Bada$$ have created a genre characterized by thoughtful, and careful lyrics along with delivery. While the themes in rap music tend to center around certain ideas, artists from all over the country have incorporated ideas relating to Christianity in their music. Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the teaching of Jesus Christ. Common themes within Christianity include miracles, repentance of transgressions, the positive qualities and effects of God himself, and people‚Äôs destination following their life on earth, referring to Heaven and Hell.  Gospel Influence  = Kanye West's The College Dropout = Released in 2004, Kanye West's debut album The College Dropout was revolutionary in terms of both production and lyrics. The \\"chipmunk soul\\" beats sampled classic soul songs to create entirely unique sounds, and West's lyrics varied greatly from the trends of gangsta rap, the prevalent genre at the time. The most prominent single on the album that references Christianity very explicitly was ‚ÄúJesus Walks.‚Äù This single was seen as a bold, open embracement of faith, as the sample of ARC Choir, ‚ÄúWalk With Me‚Äù is the backbone of the instrumental. Repeated throughout the track is ‚ÄúJesus walk with me,‚Äù conveying West‚Äôs desire to be closer to Jesus. Furthermore, West raps over the track, repeating in a sort of chorus, ‚ÄúI wanna talk to God but I‚Äôm afraid cause we ain‚Äôt spoke in so long,‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúGod show me the way because the Devil‚Äôs trying to break me down.‚Äù In these lines, West refers to God specifically, wanting to talk to him, but not being able to as a result of fear, and temptations from ‚Äúthe Devil.‚Äù Kanye goes on to talk about how everyone should be connected and talking to Jesus, even the ‚ÄúHustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers / Jesus walks with them.‚Äù Kanye raps about how he believes everyone should have some sort of savior in their life, and goes on in the song to talk about how his way of life is slowly deteriorating, and that only Jesus can save him at this point. He fears the situation because he believes that his generation, and more specifically the rappers in his generation are ‚Äúalmost nearly extinct.‚Äù West also points to his impact in the rap industry, highlighting exactly the impact his album made. West raps, ‚ÄúThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus.‚Äù Kanye West released an extremely religion-based song, and album altogether, in a largely considered secular industry of music. Later on in the album, Kanye also brings in an interlude entitled ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Fly Away,‚Äù which also happens to be a very popular gospel song, covered many times by many artists of the Christian faith. = Chance The Rapper: Coloring Book = Coloring Book is the third mixtape from Chicago artist Chance the Rapper. According to Jon Caramanica of the New York Times, Chance comes ‚Äúas close as anyone has to eradicating the walls between the sacred and the secular.‚Äù At many points throughout the project, Chance connects with his deep-rooted sense of spirituality, at one point sampling Chris Tomlin‚Äôs vocals on ‚ÄúHow Great is Our God‚Äù as an intro to the song ‚ÄúHow Great.‚Äù Chance also refers to ‚Äúblessings‚Äù on the track ‚ÄúBlessings‚Äù, saying, ‚ÄúWhen the praises go up, the blessings come down.‚Äù Chance goes onto the reprise of ‚ÄúBlessings‚Äù questioning his listeners by asking, ‚ÄúAre you ready for your miracle?‚Äù On a song unreleased on the album due to copyright issues entitled, ‚ÄúGrown Ass Kid,‚Äù Chance talks about his identity as a rapper in a largely secular industry, saying, ‚ÄúMy favorite rapper a christian rapper.‚Äù His self given identity as a Christian rapper speaks to his major influences from religion, mainly stemming from his connection to Kanye West, both as believers of Christianity, and Chicago Natives. In Jon Caramanica‚Äôs same New York Times article, he speaks on the identity Chance has created for himself. ‚ÄúThe pop song is the praise song.‚Äù Chance the Rapper has introduced his style of heavy religious themes, and turned them into songs that many have listened to and enjoyed, as it received 4 stars from Rolling Stone, a 9.1/10 on Pitchfork, and a rating of XL on XXL.  Themes of Christianity  = good kid m.A.A.d city = With a more subtle approach to incorporating religious themes, Compton-based rapper Kendrick Lamar deals more with the practical applications of religion in life. His album, good kid, m.A.A.d city, released in 2012, is a narrative on the life that Lamar lived within Compton, and the exposure at a young age to violence, alcohol, drug abuse, and other crime. Kendrick speaks to the fact that so many people in the younger generation are exposed to things like violence, and are forced to numb their pain with various methods, which he goes into great depth explaining his own personal struggle with those things. However, Kendrick points to religion as a healthy way to find relief from the pain that they may feel. The intro to the album begins with two male voices, reciting a prayer asking for forgiveness. In this prayer, the two males pray about how they, ‚Äúhumbly repent for [their] sins‚Äù and thank God for, ‚Äúsaving [them] with [His] precious blood.‚Äù Throughout this album, Kendrick highlights the idea of repentance for a life of sin, talking about how he is a ‚Äúsinner, who‚Äôs probably gonna sin again‚Äù and constantly asking that the ‚Äúlord forgive‚Äù for ‚Äúthings [he doesn‚Äôt] understand‚Äù in the song ‚ÄúBitch Don‚Äôt Kill My Vibe.‚Äù While not as explicit, Kendrick encourages those hearing his music to focus their search for relief for the pain of life to something healthy, like religion and Christianity, stressing the idea of repentance, turning away from the life of sin. = Born Sinner = Born Sinner, a 2013 release from North Carolina rapper Jermaine Cole (J. Cole) is the storyline of an adolescent, dealing with the peer pressure and the conflicting beliefs of Christianity. With many references to Christianity and church, J. Cole uses religion as a backdrop to a larger conflict. The second track on the album, entitled Kerney Sermon (Skit), is an excerpt from Pastor Kerney Thomas, a televangelist who promotes miracles through things like prayer. In this skit, Pastor Thomas preaches that his suffering was relieved through prayer, and ordering the ‚Äúpersonal prayer package,‚Äù and in doing so, is also advertising this miracle for the listeners. The next track, ‚ÄúLand of the Snakes,‚Äù highlights the adolescent wrongdoing that the character in the album gets into. J. Cole shows that Christianity and those values are center to this character, who could be himself, as he says in the chorus of the song, ‚ÄúShe said we bout to miss church while she riding me.‚Äù J. Cole shows that these values are important, and that he thinks about them, but oftentimes his youthful desires can get in the way of that. Another interlude in the song reveals that the character, who is given the name Jermaine, is missing more than just church. On ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Jermaine? (Skit),‚Äù a church choir is practicing, when they realize that ‚ÄúJermaine‚Äù is not there at the practice, and everyone begins to search for him. On the final song of the album, entitled ‚ÄúBorn Sinner,‚Äù J. Cole reflects on his life, and how he has never been able to connect with his religious beliefs. He pleads, saying, ‚ÄúNever got to church to worship Lord but please be merciful,‚Äù connecting back to the teenager in the storyline of the album up to that point. J. Cole also reflects on his weaknesses as a somewhat religious person, calling himself a ‚Äúborn sinner‚Äù and a ‚Äúsucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses,‚Äù connecting to the teenager that was so easily tempted and swayed away from his beliefs in God. J. Cole also gives himself a goal, and a determination to improve himself, and strengthen his connection to Christianity, and ultimately God himself, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a born sinner, but I‚Äôll die better than that, I swear.‚Äù Regardless of his past life of sin, or however easily tempted away from his religion he is, J. Cole plays with the idea of repentance, and the idea that he can improve himself. = The Life of Pablo = Kanye West called his 2016 release, entitled ‚ÄúThe Life of Pablo,‚Äù ‚ÄúA gospel album, with a whole lot of cursing on it.‚Äù Whether sampling Pastor T.L. Barrett‚Äôs ‚ÄúFather I Stretch My Hands,‚Äù a solemn gospel song, or explicitly talking about the need for ‚Äúfaith‚Äù on ‚ÄúUltralight Beam,‚Äù Kanye embraces his spiritual beliefs, and expresses them freely, and in a manner that can contradict the values of Christianity itself. The first track on the album, entitled ‚ÄúUltralight Beam‚Äù which features Chance the Rapper, another Chicago- native, and religious rapper, is a song that contains many explicit references to Christianity. The track begins with a child, imitating a preacher, talking about how there will be no ‚Äúdevil‚Äôs in the house‚Äù and how their family only ‚Äúwant[s] the lord.‚Äù The song‚Äôs chorus includes lines such as ‚ÄúThis is a God dream, this is everything,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tryna keep my faith, but I‚Äôm looking for more.‚Äù Kanye refers specifically to seeking out faith, and seeking his own connection to God. Chance the Rapper‚Äôs verse includes many more explicit references to Christianity. Chance raps, ‚ÄúFoot on the devil‚Äôs neck ‚Äòtil it drifted Pangea‚Äù referring Saint Michael the Archangel. This angel, in the bible, is the one to lead the army that defeated the army of Satan. Chance‚Äôs image of his ‚Äúfoot on the Devil‚Äôs neck‚Äù is a reference to that victory, but he adds in his own idea, that the defeat of Satan would unite people all over the world, similar to Pangea, the supercontinent that connected every land mass, and in Chance‚Äôs image, would connect all people, regardless of origin or location. Chance also refers to his relationship with Christianity and music, as he mentions a single from a previous project of his, called ‚ÄúSunday Candy.‚Äù In this single, he talks about his grandmother, and her influence on his spiritual beliefs, as she would always take him to church on Sunday. Chance talks about this in ‚ÄúUltralight Beam,‚Äù saying ‚ÄúI made Sunday Candy, I‚Äôm never going to hell.‚Äù The fact that Chance makes such religious-based music, and conveys that message to people, in his mind, puts him into heaven. The outro to the song includes a feature from Kirk Franklin, a well-known gospel artist. His outro is spoken, and is a ‚Äúprayer‚Äù for everyone and anyone. He prays that everyone who feels too far away from God or religion can come back. Kanye plays with the idea of repentance here, and encourages people with the idea that no one can be too far gone.  Negative views of Christianity  Rappers have also criticized religion through their music, one example of which being A$AP Rocky on his album ‚ÄúAT.LONG.LAST.A$AP,‚Äù and more specifically, the track entitled ‚ÄúHoly Ghost.‚Äù A$AP Rocky speaks on his view of Christianity and looks at his personal relationship with it, saying, ‚ÄúThey ask me why I don‚Äôt go to church no more, cause church is the new club.‚Äù A$AP draws the comparison between the club, and church, directly comparing religion and spirituality with a wild lifestyle. A$AP shows that he believes both lifestyles can have positive aspects, and negative. Both can be used to feel better about oneself, and both can essentially ruin someone‚Äôs life. A$AP goes on to talk about how Christianity attempts to ‚Äúdine us with some damn wine and crackers.‚Äù When rapping this, he points to the idea that religion is shallow, and attempts to put faith in small things, or beliefs, as opposed to addressing real issues. However, he seemed to recant some of these views in his 2018 single \\"Praise the Lord (Da Shine)\\". According to A$AP, he is more spiritual than religious, and attests to his childhood in a \\"Christian household\\" for establishing his own relationship with God. https://genius.com/14632511  See also  https://newrepublic.com/article/135723/hip-hop-hymnals https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/everywhere-ferguson-and-socio- religious-challenge-hip-hop-culture-james-samuel-logan. http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-rap-music-gospel- ae-0605-20160602-story.html.

Acting coach Ivana Chubbuck states that one of her roles is to ensure that \\"every actor...must know what the character's objective is in a scene‚Äîto win someone's love, respect, sympathy, whatever‚Äîand then must have a ruthlessness about achieving the objective.\\" Chubbuck works with actors to help them to connect with the emotion inside the character. Acting coaches also \\"...help [drama] students audition for college\\".Regan McMahon. \\"THEATER Acting coach preps drama students for college auditions\\" in The Chronicle Saturday, January 22, 2011 http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Acting-coaches-help-students- audition-for-college-2478509.php Acting coach and actor Woodell-Mascall is \\"...skilled at zeroing in on what young actors need to do to improve their performance.\\" Woodell-Mascall tells one student actor to \\"...really think about who [the character] is and what she's feeling. It's got to be real. She provides constructive criticism to students. Woodell-Mascall has helped students to get into drama programs at schools \\"...including NYU, Juilliard, Rutgers and UCLA\\". Some acting coaches use an \\"...approach and technique of acting training [that] are considered established, proven methods of creating the [dramatic] work\\", such as using the \\"...methodology of Constantin Stanislavski, Stella Adler, Uta Hagen, Lee Strasberg, and Sanford Meisner.\\" Some acting coaches provide students with a DVD or SD card recording of their acting, for the student to review their progress. Notable individuals Major acting coaches include: Larry Moss, Ivana Chubbuck, Michelle Danner, Maggie Flanigan, Terry Schreiber, David Mamet, Lee Strasberg, Michael Woolson, Stella Adler, Chambers Stevens, Sanford Meisner Working conditions Acting coaches may be freelancers who are hired for an hourly or daily rate, or they may be hired on a longer-term basis by a film studio, production company or theatre company. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top Hollywood celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over Skype or other video linkups. Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both. Other roles In some cases, acting coaches are hired to train singers in acting skills. Popular music singers may need to learn acting skills for their live concert shows, which sometimes include staged sequences, and for performing in music videos. For example, Goth-rocker Amy Lee was provided with an acting coach by her record label. In Classical music, singers performing staged operas may get help from an acting coach to prepare them for their roles. Sometimes CEOs and other leaders hire acting coaches to help them improve their performance of speeches and other general communications activities. While most acting coaches mentor actors, some also coach directors on how to improve their direction of actors. Some acting coaches offer introductions to the acting industry, to help new actors learn about auditions, the casting process, the role of agents, key acting terminology (e.g., \\"callback\\" auditions), and about important industry organizations. =Intimacy coordinator= In the television and film industry, in 2018, some production companies are hiring an \\"intimacy coordinator\\" to ensure that actors and actresses' sexual consent is obtained before shooting romantic scenes and simulated sex scenes. To address concerns about the \\"vulnerability...and the massive power balance that can happen when a powerful showrunner or director asks an actress or actor...to get naked and simulate sex for the camera\\", HBO hires an intimacy coordinator for these scenes. The intimacy coordinator is a mix of an acting coach (who makes sure that scenes look realistic) and an advocate for actors and actresses who ensures that the onscreen performers' boundaries are respected and that their physical and emotional comfort is protected.

The royal necropolis is located on the southern hillside of the -high Mount Har≈üena north of the city Amasya and the river Ye≈üilƒ±rmak.

Encouraged by Titu Maiorescu and Simion Mehedin»õi, he continued his studies of geography in Berlin and, under Emmanuel de Martonne, in Paris.Some»ôan, p. 792 After returning home, he taught high school in T√¢rgu Jiu and Bucharest from 1909 to 1915.CƒÉlinescu, p. 494 He was then assistant professor at the University of Ia»ôi, where he taught geography. In 1920, he was made professor of physical geography at the new University of Cluj. There, he set up an institute of geography, endowing it with numerous modern maps, tools, books and magazines, both Romanian and foreign. He also published an affiliated journal, LucrƒÉrile Institutului de Geografie al UniversitƒÉ»õii din Cluj. In 1929, he was hired as a professor in the new department of physical geography at Bucharest University, remaining there until his death.Some»ôan, pp. 792-93 His clear, flowing, well-explained lectures were noted for their effectiveness, in part due to his having taught pedagogy in the early 1910s.CƒÉlinescu, p. 496 Elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1920, Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site he was also a librarian and active member at the Romanian Geographic Society.Some»ôan, p. 793 During the last year of his life, he removed the volumes of the library, scattered in the basement of the Romanian Athenaeum, and set it up on iron shelves in a reading room. =Scientific activity= A foremost authority on physical geography within Romania, he published in Anuarul de Geografie »ôi Antropogeografie (1910-1915), Buletinul SocietƒÉ»õii Regale Rom√¢ne de Geografie (from 1912), Buletinul Institutului Geologic and Analele Academiei Rom√¢ne (from 1915). His most significant scientific contribution was the 1916 article \\"C√¢mpia Rom√¢nƒÉ\\", a study of the Wallachian Plain. In 1926, he published \\"Coasta de Argint\\", which combined literary prose and scientific analysis in its examination of the Balcic area along the Black Sea coast in Southern Dobruja. The work spurred enthusiasm for the region and led to the founding of a society named after the article.CƒÉlinescu, pp. 494-95 \\"Valea superioarƒÉ a Prahovei\\" (1924) was a similarly poetic look at the Bucegi Mountains. Other articles included \\"Asupra trecerii DunƒÉrii prin Por»õile de Fier\\" (1916) and \\"VƒÉile, origina »ôi evolu»õia lor\\" (1919). These publications brought him international repute, and he was part of geographic study committees at congresses held in Paris, London and Warsaw.Pu»ôcariu, p. 486 His interests extended to ethnography and folklore. Research he conducted in 1910 with George Giuglea resulted in published work on the Romanians of Serbia. His brochure O nouƒÉ »òtiin»õƒÉ, Etnografia appeared in 1927. His 1913 study \\"Rom√¢nia »ôi popoarele balcanice\\" was used for a fresh work in 1918 by Orest Tafrali to press Romanian claims on Serbia. A pair of conferences was published as \\"Carpa»õii √Æn Rom√¢nia de azi\\" (1924) and \\"Influen»õele mediului fizic asupra capitalului biologic na»õional\\" (1927), while \\"Basarabia\\" appeared in 1924. His \\"Opera GeograficƒÉ a Prin»õului D. Cantemir\\" (1924-1925) used previously unavailable documents and maps to argue that Dimitrie Cantemir was a precursor to the modern science of geography. In \\"Geografie »ôi Poezie\\" (1931) he summarized his view of the close relationship between science and poetry, as found in nature.Pu»ôcariu, p. 487 =Literature= V√¢lsan was also a writer of literature, and his first published work, \\"Valea Prahovei\\", appeared in Ziarul CƒÉlƒÉtoriilor in 1900, when he was 15. He continued to write for SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, Convorbiri Literare, Convorbiri Critice, Neamul room√¢nesc, Drum drept and Ramuri. His two books were Povestea unei tinere»õi, a 1924 prose book; and GrƒÉdina pƒÉrƒÉsitƒÉ (1925). The latter is a collection of over 40 poems, mainly published in 1904 in SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul and Convorbiri Literare. They tend to be subtle portraits of nature, infused with sunlight. Although V√¢lsan suffered much during his life, he attempted to conceal this in his writing. A solitary, even misanthropic figure, V√¢lsan found politics repugnant. However, he was a lifelong friend of Nicolae Iorga's, although it was not the latter's political side that attracted him. During World War I, he was an adviser to the cabinet, sending weekly reports about the various areas inhabited by ethnic Romanians in preparation for claims to be made during the eventual peace conference. While in Cluj, he presided over the geographic section of Astra. There, he started a geographic and ethnographic library and published a series of popular brochures.CƒÉlinescu, p. 495 V√¢lsan's health began to deteriorate during World War I.Some»ôan, p. 795 In the summer of 1935, he canceled a planned study trip to the Apuseni Mountains, instead heading to Dobruja to receive a large group of Polish tourists.

His commitment to the Gaelic language and his hostility to landlordism appears to date from his Islay days. In the 1840s Murdoch spent time in Armagh in Ulster and in Lancashire where he came into contact with Chartism and the views of Feargus O'Connor. The Chartists believed that a healthy rural population needed to own their own land and be free of the influence of landowners and employers.Ewan A. Cameron, The Life and Times of Fraser Mackintosh Crofter MP (Aberdeen: The University of Aberdeen, 2000)pp45-46 In the 1850s and 60's Murdoch spent a number of years in Dublin where he encountered Irish Nationalism and radical Irish ideas on land reform. At this time he wrote articles for the Nationalist newspaper The Nation. While working in Dublin in the 1850s he is said to have had an influence on Alexander Carmichael, a fellow Argyllshire Gael who, likewise, was employed as an exciseman.Domhnall Uilleam Sti√∫bhart (ed), The Life and Legacy of Alexander Carmichael, (Port of Ness: The Islands Book Trust,2008) p3. The Highlander On retiring to Inverness Murdoch quickly became a figure of prominence. He championed Mary MacPherson, Mairi Mh√≤r nan Oran, when she was put on trial. He is said to have arranged for her legal representation and may have introduced her to Charles Fraser-Mackintosh.Ewan A. Cameron, The Life and Times of Fraser Mackintosh Crofter MP (Aberdeen: The University of Aberdeen, 2000)pp50-51 Shortly after this he started his weekly publication,The Highlander, which ran until it succumbed to endemic financial difficulties in 1881. Professor Meek writes that the songs of Mairi Mh√≤r show the influence that The Highlander had on the opinions of ordinary Highland people, even thought the paper was mainly in English.D√≤mhnall Eachann Meek, Mairi Mh√≤r nan Oran ; Taghadh de a h-Orain (Edinburgh : Scottish Academic Press, 1998) p40 Murdoch believed that a vicious system of land ownership was at the root of all ills in the Highlands and this could only be changed by the crofters or peasants taking the lead and standing up for themselves in a campaign for land reform. In common with other campaigners for Highland land reform Murdoch maintained that the crofters had an inalienable right to the land which, they asserted, had belonged to the clan as a whole and had not been the personal property of chief.James Hunter, The Making of the Crofting Community, (Edinburgh : John Donald,1976) p129 &157-159 He argued that a sustained attack on the Gaelic language and culture had all but destroyed the self-confidence and morale of the indigenous Highlanders and that this needed to be reversed as part of the land reform campaign.T.M. Devine, Clanship to Crofters' War, (Manchester ; Manchester Univ. Press, 1994)pp212-3 Murdoch's kilted figure became familiar in crofting townships as he urged crofters to organise and stand up for themselves. Affectionately known as Murchadh na Feilidh (Murdo the kilt), he encouraged the crofting population to set higher value on their country, race, lore and language. Influence Hunter credits him with bringing together urban middle class Gaels, who had lost contact with crofts and crofting but had retained a sense of their Gaelic identity, and the crofting communities of the Highlands and IslandsJames Hunter, The Making of the Crofting Community, (Edinburgh : John Donald,1976) pp129-30 Murdoch was possibly the single most influential individual in the creation of the atmosphere and situation that resulted in The Crofters' War, The Napier Commission and the resultant Crofters Act of the 1880s. While many of the leaders of the land reform movement were associated with the Liberal Party, Murdoch was a socialist. He stood unsuccessfully for the Scottish Land Restoration League in Partick at the 1885 UK general election, and persuaded Keir Hardie to stand as an Independent Labour candidate and was one of the chairs at the meeting to found the Scottish Labour Party.James Young, \\"Murdoch, John\\", in: http://cscs.academicblogs.co.uk/radicals-john-murdoch- and-the-birth-of-scottish-socialism/ He died on 29 January 1903 at Saltcoats in Ayrshire, where he had moved with his wife some years previously. He is buried in Ardrossan cemetery.James Hunter, For The People's Cause : From the Writings of John Murdoch, (Edinburgh : HMSO, 1986)p38 In fiction Murdoch features as a character, writing for The Inverness Courier, in Graeme Macrae Burnet's Man Booker Prize short listed novel His Bloody Project.Graeme Macrae Burnet, His Bloody Project, (Glasgow; Saraband, 2015)  References  Category:1818 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Scottish human rights activists Category:Scottish journalists Category:Scottish socialists ","title":"John Murdoch (editor)"},{"id":"51781887","text":"Jaye Bailey (born 19 January 1973) is a New Zealand softball player.

Career In 2018, Thiermann co-created The Motherfucker Awards with author Chris Ryan. At a sold-out gala in LA, famous comedians represented the corporations that did the most to fuck Mother Earth and gave acceptance speeches on their behalf. The aim of the show is to create corporate accountability through comedy. From 2014-2017, he worked with Discovery Digital Networks as an on-camera correspondent. He frequently appears on their Seeker Stories, DNews, and VR channels. He also works closely with his main surf sponsor, Patagonia to test products, garner media, and help them use business to implement solutions to the environmental crisis. Thierman speaks at universities throughout the country and in 2011 he gave a TEDx Talk in his wetsuit. His surfing and film making successes have earned him the Brower Youth Award, American Clean Skies Award, Blue Vision Youth Award, and Surfrider's Pro Surfer Environmental Achievement Award.  Early career  From ages 18‚Äì25, Thierman created and hosted the YouTube series Surfing For Change. His channel has more than 2.5 million views. While traveling to the best waves around the world, Thiermann created gonzo-style mini-documentaries about current environmental issues happening in the regions. In the series, Thiermann focused on the power people have to create a better world through everyday decisions. His first YouTube video in the series details how money kept in multinational banks can be used to finance destructive projects all over the world. This video inspired people to move millions of dollars out of centralized banks and into local banks and credit unions, and reached people throughout North America, South America, Africa and much of Europe. Thiermann explains, ‚ÄúBecause I see a big disconnect between the people who are doing awesome work in world and their ability to communicate that work with the rest of world. I see myself as a conduit between people and big organizations, and I package their stories in a way that is digestive enough so that they can take action.\\" Thierman has covered controversial stories all over the world. These stories have included the Indonesian trash epidemic, GMO protests in Hawaii, working conditions in Sri Lanka, nuclear power in South Africa, and the adverse effects of surf tourism in Nicaragua.

The company is headquartered in Quebec City and is mainly active in Quebec. However, since 2008, La Capitale has extended its services into Ontario. La Capitale General Insurance ranks among the largest insurers in Quebec.  History  La Capitale has it origins in a mutual fund that was formed in 1940 by state employees from Parliament Hill in Quebec who wanted to establish a more secure way to pay for their funeral expenses. The official name for this group was la Mutuelle des employ√©s civils. Still operating under la Mutuelle des employ√©s civils name, in 1947, the organization issued its first life insurance policies and opened its first office in Montreal, Quebec. Initially, la Mutuelle des employ√©s civils only offered insurance products for state employees. However, in 1954, the Quebec Liquor Commission became the first business to hold a group insurance contract with the organization. In 1976, the first subsidiary of la Mutuelle des employ√©s civils, La Capitale General Insurance, was formed. The creation of La Capitale General Insurance also signified the organization's move from only offering insurance products to state employees to offering their products to everyone. =Formation= Beginning with La Capitale General Insurance, the mutual company continued to form new subsidiaries, including La Capitale MFQ Real Estate Management in 1981, which is responsible for acquisitions and property management, La Capitale Insurance and Financial Services in 1989, and La Capitale Civil Service Mutual and La Capitale Civil Service Insurer in 1991, among others. In 1989, La Capitale Financial Group Inc. was formed to serve as a holding company overseeing all of La Capitale's various subsidiaries. Although a holding company, La Capitale Financial Group Inc. was still controlled by la Mutuelle des employ√©s civils. In 2000, La Capitale subsidiaries underwent a brand change and officially adopted the La Capitale banner. =Expansion of headquarters= From 1962 to 2013, La Capitale's head office was located in Parliament Hill in Quebec City, at the corner of Saint-Amable and De La Chevroti√®re. In 2013, the construction of La Capitale's new headquarters building, also located in Parliament Hill in Quebec City, was completed. The inauguration of La Capitale's new headquarters was attended by Premier Pauline Marois, the Minister of Finance and Economy, Nicolas Marceau, and Quebec City's mayor, R√©gis Labeaume. The La Capitale building would serve as the new head offices for La Capitale and all of its subsidiaries. As of 2013, La Capitale employs approximately 3,000 staff members at this head office in Quebec. =Expansion into Ontario= La Capitale and its various subsidiaries continued to experience growth in the early 2000s, with a significant acquisition completed in 2004, when La Capitale purchased L'Unique General Insurance for $48 million. By 2007, La Capitale had become the fourth largest property and casualty insurer in Quebec In 2008, La Capitale saw that it was facing a limited and in many ways saturated insurance market in Quebec. In 2009, intent on finding new revenue streams, the company initiated a project to enter the Ontario market for the first time. The company would do business in Ontario under its same La Capitale General Insurance brand name and would remain headquartered in Quebec City. The 2009 growth project was executed in two fronts. The first part would be to develop La Capitale's business in property and casualty insurance in Ontario. The second part would be to strengthen the presence of L'Unique General Insurance in Quebec. As part of La Capitale's move into Ontario, in 2008, La Capitale General Insurance acquired York Fire & Casualty Insurance Co., an insurance company providing automobile and property insurance in Ontario and Alberta. York Fire & Casualty was purchased from Kingsway Financial Services Inc. Prior to this acquisition, in 2006, La Capitale Civil Service Insurer Inc. acquired Penncorp Life Insurance Co., a specialty accident and disability insurance firm located in Mississauga, Ontario. In 2005, La Capitale Financial Group acquired the AGA Financial Group, a company active outside of Quebec. As of 2016, La Capitale has more than doubled its business done outside of Quebec.  Company structure  La Capitale is organized into different divisions, each responsible for a separate line of business. * La Capitale Civil Service Insurer: offers financial products to Quebec's public service staff. * La Capitale General Insurance: is a subsidiary of La Capitale that has provided property and casualty insurance for over seventy years. * La Capitale Insurance and Financial Services: is a subsidiary of La Capitale that provides group insurance products to the private and public sectors, in addition to individual products to individuals outside the public sector.

It had also been the home of Ebenezer Cobb Morley (1831‚Äì1924), sportsman, regarded as the father of The Football Association and modern football. In 1812, there was a notorious murder at No. 27. It was then the country home of Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues (1753‚Äì1812) and his wife, the celebrated soprano Madame Saint-Huberty (1756‚Äì1812), who were both killed with a dirk and pistol by an Italian servant whom they had dismissed. The servant (Lorenzo, a deserter from the French army in Spain) then shot himself dead at the house. It has never been established whether the murder was committed from private or political motives. Some claimed that the motive behind the murders was simply the fact that Madame Saint-Huberty treated her servants badly. Others saw more sinister political machinations at work, as the d'Antraigues were active spies, working for the Bourbons, Russia and Britain.

Family and education Vicente Grez Y√°var was born in Santiago in 1847, the son of Manuel Grez and Manuela Y√°var. He studied humanities at the National Institute after some elementary courses at San Luis College. He entered law school, but his literary interests led him to drop out. He married Mercedes Mulet on 4 February 1867 at the . They had one son. Journalistic and literary career Grez began his work in journalism in 1868 as editor of El Charivari, a satirical political publication. He also collaborated, under various pseudonyms, on publications such as La Linterna del Diablo, with caustic verses lampooning public figures. These early activities as a journalist shaped the rest of his life, leading to jobs as editor and publisher of the newspapers El Heraldo, La √âpoca, La Rep√∫blica, La Campana, La Patria (of which he was director from 1893 to 1894), La Opini√≥n, and El Mercurio, and the magazines La Revista de Santiago, Sud-Am√©rica, Las Veladas Literarias, Las Novedades, El Nuevo Ferrocarril, Los Debates, Los Lunes, El Sal√≠n and Revista de Artes y Letras. In his first books he displayed an interest in publicizing the history of Chile. His novel Las mujeres de la Independencia (1878) formed a portrait of several important Chilean women of the early 19th century. La vida santiaguina (1879) characterized some aspects of 17th century Chilean society. El combate hom√©rico (1880) narrated the events of the naval Battle of Iquique. In 1882 he released R√°fagas, a collection of short poems which had previously been published in El Heraldo. His later novels Emilia Reynals (1883), La dote de una joven (1884), Marianita (1881), and El ideal de una esposa (1887) were very well received by the reading public and were compared with the works of Alberto Blest Gana. Pages of his unpublished novel Jenio sin alas were published in La Revista Nueva in 1900. He was also an art critic, founding the Revista de Bellas Artes (1889‚Äì1890) and serving as secretary of the organizing committee of Chile's presentation at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. At this time he wrote the book Les beaux arts au Chili. Grez's work culminated with his particular vision of the era and of nortino territory, Viaje de destierro (1893). Political and public career Grez was a member of the National or Montt-Varist Party. In 1875, he became head of the Foreign Section of Correos de Chile, and in 1888 took over as head of the National Statistics Institute, a position he held until his death in 1909. He was alternate deputy for Arauco from 1882 to 1885, and for Taltal from 1885 to 1888. Later he took over as primary deputy for Taltal, from 1888 to 1891. He was second vice president of the Chamber of Deputies from 16 January 1890 to the dissolution of the National Congress in 1891. He was one of the signatories of the deposition of President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda in 1891. He was exiled to Peru and returned to Chile in 1893.

The game is based on the Hot Wheels toy line which manufactured by Mattel. Gameplay Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing features 26 vehicles based on Hot Wheels toy cars. The game features 11 courses, each one resembling real Hot Wheels toy racetracks. The courses are divided across four areas: Death Valley, Jungle, Metropolis, and Volcano. Each level features a major trap or enemy that must be avoided, such as giant boulders, a giant scorpion, and a giant octopus. The player can use turbo boosts to speed up in races, and slow-motion to safely drift around corners; both abilities are depleted as they are used, and can be refilled by landing specific giant jumps or by avoiding the traps and enemies in each level. Performance upgrades, including better acceleration, improved handling, and new tires, can be won from races. Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing features four gameplay modes. In Quick Race, the player may choose any track on which to race. In Survival mode, the player must win races that become increasingly difficult. In Time Trial mode, the player must race against a time limit. In Collector mode, the player is the sole vehicle and must collect golden medals scattered around a racetrack. The game also includes a local multiplayer mode for up to four people. Release Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing was released in North America on June 29, 2007. The game was subsequently released in Europe on August 24, 2007, and in Australia on September 20, 2007. Reception On review aggregator Metacritic, Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing has a score of 60, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews.\\" Michael Pereira of IGN called the gameplay \\"brutally unforgiving,\\" saying it \\"is inconsistent with its harshness. You can be way ahead of everyone for two laps, barely nick a corner in the third, and find yourself in last place. It's kind of like F-Zero GX without the tight controls to justify the difficulty. There is no warning of where these cars come from or how they even got so close. Not to mention that your numbered position doesn't actually stay on the screen -- it annoyingly flashes in the upper left hand corner at the most random times. You will have to memorize the courses to get anywhere in this game.\\" Pereira felt that the gameplay's reliance on turbo boosts and slow motion \\"is actually its biggest problem,\\" and wrote that \\"all of the graphics are muddy, and it's sometimes hard to tell where the road ends and walls begin. Some of the later stages are worth unlocking and there is some genuine creativity to some of the traps, but the frustration involved in unlocking them might dissuade people. Each stage is a set of races with each race having some requirements to proceed (you must place first, in the top three, etc). However, if you mess up just one race, the entire thing is over and you have to go back to the first race. It's pretty annoying to perform perfectly in two races and then have your hopes and dreams crushed in the third.\\" Pereira also wrote that the game's problems \\"are magnified\\" in its Collector mode: \\"Fall down a hole, and you reset at awkward places and can't grab certain medals until the next lap; some medals can only be grabbed with boost (boost you don't always have); and the worst thing is that you have to redo an entire series if you miss a medal on a track. Oh yes, miss one medal (out of thirty or so) on track No. 4 and you'll have to go back to the first track.\\" Louis Bedigian of GameZone praised the \\"great\\" controls and \\"super- intense\\" speed, and was also impressed by the \\"mind-blowing, jaw-on-the-floor gameplay\\" that he felt was more typical of a PlayStation 2 game. Bedigian wrote that, \\"This racer, with its Extreme-G-style thrills and F-Zero GX- crushing gameplay is everything a player ‚Äì young or old ‚Äì looks for in a racing game. It makes all previous Hot Wheels titles appear to be nothing more than a child's plaything.\\" Bedigian noted the game's complete lack of vehicle damage and wrote \\"though we love to see explosions and body damage, it's doubtful that any amount of destruction would have made this game better. Chances are it would have taken away from the overall speed of the game, which is generally a non-stop experience.\\" However, Bedigian criticized some of the game's courses for being too dark in color: \\"Since the PSP has limited picture-tweaking features, you can't lighten the screen to entirely eliminate the darkness. The opposite wouldn't have been better ‚Äì make the game too bright and you'll drive us crazy. But while this was something I could tolerate, I'm not sure an impatient eight-year-old will feel the same way.\\" Bedigian also criticized the game's small number of courses, but felt that its replayability was adequate compensation. Frank Prove of GameSpot said the game could be considered a \\"no-frills knockoff of Need For Speed Underground. [...] Generally speaking, the racing action is solid. However, there aren't a whole lot of different tracks or competitions, and the 3D graphics don't hold a candle to A-list racers like Ridge Racer or Wipeout.\\" Provo criticized the game's lack of online connectivity for features such as multiplayer, and noted the game's average sound effects and music. Provo also wrote that \\"aside from the jump ramps and falling rocks, the courses aren't actually all that interesting. The textures are simple and muddy, and there aren't many identifiable landmarks along the raceways.\\" Provo felt that the game's \\"biggest problem\\" was its lack of content and concluded that there were better racing games available for the PlayStation Portable, writing that, \\"Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing isn't a bad game by any stretch, but you should probably pass on it unless you're a Hot Wheels fanatic or have a pathological need to get another racer for your PSP.\\" References External links * Hot Wheels: Ultimate Racing at MobyGames Category:2007 video games Category:Hot Wheels video games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Portable- only games Category:Racing video games Category:Destination Software games Category:Video games developed in Italy ","title":"Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing"},{"id":"51782924","title":"Shankhachil"},{"id":"51782930","text":"Enlow may refer to: *Enlow, Pennsylvania *Enlow (band) *Blayne Enlow, born 1999 ","title":"Enlow"},{"id":"51782944","text":"Tr·∫ßn Minh L·ª£i (born 19 September 1986) is Vietnamese footballer who plays for the TƒêCS ƒê·ªìng Th√°p as a midfielder.

It premiered at the Moscow Maly Theatre on 6 November 1880 (as a benefit for Mikhail Sadovsky who played Rabachev) and first appeared in print in 1881, in Ogonyok magazines (issues 6-10), as the Ostrovsky and Solovyov's joint work. Modern Russian critics see it as a precursor to Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, both plays focusing on the Russian gentry at different stages of its decline or, in case of Chekhov's play, collapse. Background The playwright Nikolai Solovyov (1845-1898), Ostrovsky's friend and prot√©g√©, published 23 plays. Four of them, including Light Without Heat, he co-authored with Ostrovsky In May 1880 Nikolai Solovyov approached Ostrovsky with the idea of writing a play together and suggested they should take as a basis his newly written piece called Broken Happiness (–†–∞–∑–±–∏—Ç–æ–µ —Å—á–∞—Å—Ç—å–µ). In early August Solovyov brought the rough copy of his version to Shchelykovo, the Ostrovskys' estate. \\"I've just finished Act 1. We need not hurry. After the success of [The Marriage of] Belugin and The Wild One we have to put all our energy into this single work,\\" Ostrovsky wrote him later this month, referring to the two plays they had recently co-authored and saw being staged. What he did then was reject the original title, as well as the next one, Na Rodine (In the Native Place). On 2 October he wrote to Solovyov: \\"We cannot hit upon the proper title, what could this mean? Only that the play's leitmotif remains unclear even to ourselves. The plotline is still underdeveloped... and even the main question remains unanswered: what the play purports to say exactly?\\" He continued: \\"OzerskoyThat was how Rabachev's character was originally called. His friend's surname, Zavalishin, has been changed to Zaleshin by Ostrovsky is a hot-headed man, not very intelligent and somewhat primitive. His love for Olya amounts to little more than a sensual instinct. Only in the Act 4 it dawns upon him all of a sudden that his life with Olya will be as dreary as Zavalishin's life with his wife. So there it is, the core of his personal drama. He is torn between two women: one superior to him, another inferior. He rejects the latter and gets rejected by the former.\\" Finally in this letter, Ostrovsky suggested another title: \\"The play should be called Light Without Heat. Renyova only lightens for them their swamp of a life, giving nothing at all. It highlights the play's main conflict. For Zavalishin and [Rabachev] she lightens their respective lives, but gives neither of them any warmth. The former, crashed by apathy, sinks into his personal mire. The latter, an impulsive one, literally throws himself off the cliff.\\" Of the total 182 pages of the play's handwritten manuscript everything starting with page 50 has been written by Solovyov. Ostrovsky has made numerous cuts and additions to this final draft, dealing mostly with the characters' language, to make it more laconic and expressive. He re-worked several episodes he considered vital either for the play's structure or for properly portraying its characters, as well as the finales of all the five acts. Completely re-worked by Ostrovsky was the central scene of the Act 3, depicting the emotionally charged dialogue between Rabachev and Olya. Characters * Anna Vladimirovna Renyova, beautiful landowner, approaching 30. She arrives from Paris to her estate with a view to sell part of it and have some rest in the country from the high society pleasures she'd been enjoying to the full * Semyon Semyonych Zaleshin, her middle-aged neighbour and Rabachev's friend. Infatuated with Renyova, he is driven to alcoholism by this all-consuming passion * Avdotya Vasylievna, Zaleshin's wife * Khudobayev, retired high-ranking state official, another victim to Renyova's charms * Denis Ivanovich Deryugin, rich peasant, eager to buy the estate * Boris Borisovich Rabachev, Renyova's young neighbour who thinks he's in love with Olya, but easily succumbs to Renyova's aggressive lovemaking * Olya Vasilkova, a young girl, vulnerable, naive and idealistic, daughter to Renyova's estate's former manager * Dasha, Renyova's maid, Ilyich, an old man, Renyova's serf; Stepanida, the latter's old wife Synopsis Beautiful but worn-out Renyova arrives to her estate from Paris and amuses herself with trying to seduce Rabachev, her young, good-looking neighbour, thus ruining both his life and that of Olya, the girl he loves and was about to marry. Production history Light Without Heat was premiered in Moscow's Maly Theatre on 1880, as a benefit for the actor Mikhail Sadovsky who played Rabachev. Also performing were Nadezhda Nikulina (Renyova), Maria Yermolova (Olya), Olga Sadovskaya (Zaleshina), Vladimir Maksheyev (Zaleshin) and Nikolai Muzil (Khudobayev). The general response to the premiere was negative. \\"That's what comes out of having no final rehearsal. The second performance will be better and the whole thing will just grow,\\" wrote Ostrovsky to his friend, the actor Fyodor Burdin. He proved to be right. \\"The 4th performance was sold out, and the response was excellent,\\" wrote Ostrovsky in a 20 November letter to Solovyov. On 14 November Light Without Heat was performed at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, as a benefit for Burdin who played Khudobayev. Among other actors involved were Antonina Abarinova (Renyova), Maria Savina (Olya), Nikolai Sazonov (Rabachev), Vladimir Davydov (Deryugin) and Alexander Nilsky (Zaleshin). \\"Here the cast was superb and the public greatly enjoyed it, the premiere was a furor and the second performance even better,\\" Solovyov informed Ostrovsky. In December 1894 Light Without Heat opened at the Society of Art and Literature. Cast included Konstantin Stanislavski as RabachevBenedetti (1999a, 385). and Maria Andreyeva who made her stage debut as Olya Vasilkova.Maria Andreyeva.

By 1931, Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery had died, making this a win for his son, Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery. Sandwich was a half-brother to Manna, winner of the 1925 Epsom Derby, and as well as his 1931 St Leger success also won the Chester Vase and King Edward VII Stakes.  Background  Sandwich was a bay stallion, bred in Great Britain by the Irish breeder, James J. Maher. He was sired by the 1924 Epsom Derby winner, Sansovino. His dam Waffles was unraced but had previously produced the Derby winner Manna. As a yearling, he was purchased by Lord Rosebery for 3,600 guineas and was sent to trainer Jack Jarvis. Racing career = Training = As part of the Rosebery stable, Sandwich was trained by Jack Jarvis. Jarvis was noted for being the first trainer to be knighted for his service and contribution to horse racing. Jarvis' reputation for training horses was to work them hard, and he found success with his approach.  Racing  Sandwich was slow to mature and after finishing unplaced in his only races as a juvenile in 1930 he was well beaten in both the Craven Stakes and the 2000 Guineas the following spring. When moved up in distance he showed immediate improvement: in May, ridden by Billy Nevett, he won the Chester Vase, a major trial race for the Epsom Derby. In June Sandwich, ridden by Harry Wragg he started at odds of 8/1 for the Derby. After being hampered early in the race and losing his position he finished strongly to take third behind Cameronian and Orpen. Jarvis said that the colt was \\"beaten by the bad draw\\". Later that month he won the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot at odds of 1/3. When matched against older horses for the first time in the Eclipse Stakes he finished third behind the 25/1 outsider Caerleon. The St. Leger race is the oldest of the five British Classic races, the last in the year to be run, and it is also the longest. In this race in 1931, Sandwich was again ridden by Wragg, nicknamed \\"The Head Waiter.\\" Sandwich's win in the St Leger was considered by some to be an upset as he bested the favorite, Cameronian, who was at the time making a run at the final leg of the British Triple Crown. Cameronian finished last in the field. Sandwich remained in training as a four-year-old and was expected to be a leading contender in the \\"Cup races\\" (major weight-for-age staying events). He failed to live up to expectations but did win The Whip at Newmarket Racecourse and finished third under a weight of 131 pounds in the Cesarewitch. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Sandwich was retired to stud but was a complete failure as a breeding stallion. He was sold and exported to Brazil in 1941. Namesake The London & North Eastern Railway A3 class locomotive 2504 was named after the horse. Built at Doncaster Works in September 1934, it was withdrawn by British Rail in March 1963.  Pedigree  *Sandwich was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Isinglass and Pilgrimage, meaning that these stallions appear twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. Furthermore, there is a 3 √ó 4 inbreeding to St Simon.

The Whole30 is similar to but more restrictive than the paleo diet, as adherents may not eat natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup. Overall the Whole30 diet is nutritionally unsound; while its emphasis on protein and whole foods is aligned with mainstream advice, dieticians have criticized it for its restrictive nature, its \\"bizarre\\" exclusions, and its possible negative effects on dieters' social lives. In 2019, it was ranked 38th out of 41 diets by U.S. News & World Report. Description Foods allowed during the program include meat, nuts, seeds, seafood, eggs, vegetables, and fruits. During the Whole30, participants are advised not to count calories or to weigh themselves. After the program is complete, participants are counselled to strategically reintroduce foods outside the endorsed Whole30 list, document the health consequences and culinary value of these additions, and determine whether the addition is desired. The program's founders believe that sugar, grains, dairy, alcohol, and legumes affect weight, energy, and stress levels. Losing weight is not a focus of Whole30; calorie-counting and weigh-ins are not allowed. History  The program was created by wife and husband Melissa (Hartwig) Urban and Dallas Hartwig in April 2009. They both became certified sports nutritionists; he worked as a physical therapist, and she was working at an insurance company during the day and doing nutritional consulting in her spare time. She quit her job to run the Whole30 business in 2010. They co- authored It Starts With Food (2012) and The Whole30: The 30-Day Guide to Total Health and Food Freedom (2015). They separated in 2015. and Melissa (Hartwig) Urban took over the business, and published Food Freedom Forever: Letting Go of Bad Habits, Guilt, and Anxiety Around Food in 2016. In July 2016, a New York Times article on use of Instagram by dieters noted that participants in the Whole30 program had shared over one million Instagram posts using the #Whole30 hashtag, and noted that those sharing the tag were \\"one of seemingly endless like-minded communities,\\" comparing it with the over 3.5 million posts under the #WeightWatchers hashtag. Criticisms No studies that specifically look into the health impacts of the Whole30 had been conducted as of 2019. While dietitians generally agree with the program's emphasis on proteins, vegetables and unprocessed foods and the avoidance of added sugars and alcohol, they also view the diet as too extreme. Some nutrition researchers have meticulously evaluated the claims made in the program and found them to lack any evidence. The diet ranked last among 38 popular diets evaluated by U.S. News & World Report in its 2016 Best Diets Rankings; one of the raters, dietitian Meridan Zerner said: \\"We want behavioral changes and dietary changes that are slow and progressive and meaningful.\\" David L. Katz said of the diet: \\"The grouping [of banned foods] is both random, and rather bizarre from a nutrition perspective. If the idea is good nutrition, cutting out whole grains and legumes is at odds with a boatload of evidence.\\" It was selected as one of the worst health trends for 2013 by Health Magazine. In 2017, the diet was ranked last (out of 38 diets) by U.S. News & World Report on account of its extremely restrictive nature and likely adverse effects on a dieter's social life. In 2018, the Whole30 was ranked 37 out of 40 by U.S. News & World Report, and in 2019, it was ranked 38th out of 41.

The company also manufactured woodworking machinery, industrial safes, French Burr millstones, Boilers, Turbine Water Wheels, Bark Mills and a variety of Tannery machines. They primarily supplied the Canadian market, but the company had a strong export business to Mexico and South America.  History  = The Dumfries Foundry = The company was originally founded in Galt as the Dumfries Foundry in 1844 by James Andrews and James Crombie. The exact number of products manufactured by the foundry during this period is unclear, however it is known that apart from steam engines the company also produced safe doors. In 1850 Andrews was experiencing financial troubles and Crombie took over the business, renaming it to Crombie & Co. During the Crimean War in 1854 Crombie's business thrived as Great Britain focused its efforts on manufacturing war materials which forced Canada to depend more on domestic production. This created an economic boom in Galt and led to a great increase of employees. It was also around this time that the Great Western Railway built a branch line in Galt, which made it easier for Crombie to export the heavy equipment that was being manufactured by the company. In 1859 Crombie sold the company to John Goldie and Hugh McCulloch, two of his employees, for $50,000 and it was subsequently renamed Goldie McCulloch & Co. It is said that Crombie expected the pair's business venture to fail and intended to buy the company back from them for a fraction of the price they paid. The two had great success however and over the next sixty years Goldie McCulloch & Co. grew into a major manufacturing company with a broad line of products. = The Goldie & McCulloch Company Ltd. = Patented Wheelock Engine manufactured by Goldie & McCullochGoldie McCulloch & Co. received its first major contract for machinery in 1862 from the Great Western Railway's rolling mills in Hamilton. In 1867 the company had greatly expanded its production to include Water Wheels, Flax Mills, Tannery Machines and Boilers, among others. It was also in this year that Stephen Wilcox and George Babcock founded Babcock & Wilcox, which would play a major role in the company's future. Near the end of the 1860s, Goldie McCulloch & Co. began manufacturing hopper cars for the Credit Valley Railway. This increase in business must have put a great strain on the old foundry buildings that were still being used by the company. In 1870, extensive additions and improvements were made to the buildings. A large plot of land adjacent to the foundry was also purchased by the company in March of that same year with the intentions of constructing a new building. The building which was to be constructed was described by The Galt Reporter as \\"A range of shops for blacksmiths, boilermakers, millstone builders with a large store-house attached; also a stone store-house 84 square feet, three stories high, to be built on a lot opposite the Foundry...\\". The building, which was used for the remainder of the company's lifespan, is still standing today and has since been restored and converted into a mall. The year 1873 saw another expansion at the foundry. The old tannery property next door was bought, the buildings were gutted, and a 60-horsepower steam engine was installed in the rebuilt structure. By 1880 safes and vaults had become an important part of the firm's exports and a decision was made to expand that line of products. Property was bought in 1882 for a vault machine shop and a moulding shop, another lot was also acquired in 1883 for further expansion. This was also the year that the company obtained the Canadian patent to the Wheelock engine. This would become one of Goldie McCulloch's & Co.'s defining products, with at least a few engines remaining in operation more than 100 years later. Steam engine built in 1908 by Goldie & McCulloch Co. Ltd. In June 1886, Goldie McCulloch & Co. was again undertaking construction. The old sawmill across from the foundry was torn down and replaced by a stone building 140 x 64 feet and two stories high. On April 21, 1891, the company incorporated and became The Goldie & McCulloch Company Limited. In 1902 the company employed around 450 people, a substantial amount more than the 22 workers it had when it was bought from Crombie. In 1910 the company sold their woodworking division to MacGregor, Gourlay Co. which used it, as well as several other companies, to form Canada Machinery Corp., Ltd. As the company expanded, it began to supply equipment to some famous Canadian landmarks. In 1922, the company supplied three Type D Cross Drum Sectional Water Tube Boilers to the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec City. = Babcock-Wilcox & Goldie-McCulloch Ltd. = By 1922 both the Goldie and McCulloch families still held a majority of the company's assets, however this would change the following year. In 1923 the company was purchased by Babcock, Wilcox & Co. which used it to form Babcock-Wilcox & Goldie-McCulloch Limited, the Canadian division of Babcock & Wilcox. In 1968 the name was changed to Babcox & Wilcox Canada Ltd.. The company continued to manufacture steam engines in Galt under the Babcock & Wilcox name until 1987.

It was designated as the seat of a lordship in 1389 and was acquired in 1716 by the Governor of Charleroi, Rodrigo de Peralta, who built a castle surrounded by a moat. In 1767, the structure was modernized with a basement addition, a tower and a ground floor stuccoed room decorated to 18th-century tastes. In 1798, through marriage, the castle became the stronghold of the . The English garden, designed on the plan of a park was created in May, 1834 by C. Th. Petersen, probably at the request of Balthazar de Villegas. It became the home of Count L√©on de Villegas de Saint-Pierre when he gave up a diplomatic career to become mayor of Chauss√©e- Notre-Dame-Louvignies, after his marriage in 1868 to Marie-Ferdinande de Maillin. In 1870 the Count began a massive renovation of the property, hiring D√©sir√© Limbourg as the architect to renovate the buildings and Louis Fuchs, as the landscape architect. After the purchase of additional land, drainage and backfilling of surrounding moats, 600 trees were planted in 1871. The following year a pond, spanned by two bridges, was created and the cooling house was built. In 1873, paths and lawns were completed, and the park was fenced and gated. Between 1874 and 1875, the Marsh Chapel was built, followed by a stable wing and carriage house. The castle itself was restructured between 1878 and 1882. The tower was enlarged to dominate the north side and the southern facing wing was doubled in size. A new wing on the ground floor contained state rooms, a lounge and dining room and the eastern wing was extended adding turrets and modern amenities. The entrance beneath a wide porch, which had formerly been on the west at the end of the bridge over the moat, was moved to the southern fa√ßade overlooking the park. Upon entering the vestibule, rooms branched to the right into the welcoming parlor and to the left into the pool room with a large sweeping staircase. The staircase was festooned with metal railings and motifs of the Villegas Family arms. The interior was remodeled but the fireplaces and painted areas above the doors were restored. The upstairs bedrooms with baths stood on either side of a central hallway. The kitchen and service areas were located in the basement and dumbwaiters were installed. Radiators were later added and electricity was installed in 1897. At present the grounds are open from May to November. The interior design, furniture and household items which belonged to the Villegas Family have been preserved in the home. It is representative of the Belle Epoque period. The property has been featured in several films, including Claude Berri's Germinal, Fran√ßois Ozon's Angel and Fran√ßois-Xavier Vives' film Landes, featuring Marie Gillain.

The most significant plays from the end of World War II until the 1980s were \\"Friendship and love\\", \\"Career and Conscience\\" by Abisheva, \\"Millionaire\\" by Mustafina, \\"Yesterday and Today\\", \\"Hard Fate\\" by Khusainov, \\"One tree - not the forest\\" by Tazhibaeva, \\"cub under a cap\\", \\"Matchmaker arrived\\" \\"In a foreign country,\\" by Mukhamedzhanov, \\"Saule\\", \\"Buran\\" by Akhtanov, \\"The Heart of the poet\\" Shashkin, \\"unquenchable fire\\" Kabdolov, \\"Ascent of Mount Fuji\\" by Aitmatov, Mukhamedzhanov and many others [2]. In 2006 the theater was closed for renovation. A modern lighting, sound equipment, air conditioning and heating system was installed. The restoration lasted for almost three years, in which theater reopened its doors on December 2008.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India. Chamundaraja succeeded Viryarama, who had succeeded Vakpatiraja II. According to historian R. B. Singh, Virayarama and Chamundaraja were sons of Vakpatiraja. According to Dasharatha Sharma, all three were sons of Govindaraja III. Chamundaraja's predecessor Viryarama had been killed by the Paramara king Bhoja. It is possible that the Paramaras occupied Shakambhari for a brief period. According to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Chamundaraja would have evicted them with support from the Naddula Chahamana ruler Anahilla. The Sundha inscription of the Naddula Chahamanas claims that Anahilla killed Bhoja's general Sadha, and captured Shakambhari. Chamundaraja appears to have defeated a Muslim army, as suggested by multiple texts including Prabandha Kosha, Hammira Mahakavya and Surjana Charita. The Prabandha Kosha describes him as \\"the slayer of the Sultan\\", while the Hammira Mahakavya states that he defeated one \\"Hejim-ud- Din\\". The Chahamana kingdom bordered the Ghaznavid Empire, and it is possible that Chamundaraja foiled a Ghaznavid invasion. No Ghaznavid Sultan after Mawdud of Ghazni is known to have personally led an army to India; it is possible that the \\"Sultan\\" slayed by Chamundaraja was a Ghaznavid general. According to Prithviraja Vijaya, Chamundaraja commissioned a Vishnu temple at Narapura (modern Narwar in Ajmer district). Chamundaraja was succeeded by his son Durlabharaja III, who was succeeded by his other son Vigraharaja III. The Bijolia inscription places one Simhata between the Chamundaraja and Durlabharaja III. According to Dasharatha Sharma, Simhata could have been an elder brother of Durlabharaja.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.  Early life  Durlabha-raja III, also known as Du≈õala, succeeded his father Chamundaraja on the Chahamana throne. The Bijolia inscription places one Simhata between the two. Historian Dasharatha Sharma theorizes that Simhata could have been an elder brother of Durlabharaja.  Conflict with the Gujarat Chaulukyas  Two relatively late texts suggest that Durlabharaja was involved in a conflict with Karna, the Chaulukya king of Gujarat. The Prabandha Kosha claims that Durlabha defeated the Gurjara king, brought him to Ajmer in chains and forced him to sell yogurt in a market. The Hammira Mahakavya claims that Karna died in a battle against Durlabha, and lost all his wealth to the Chahamana king. This is known to be historically incorrect, because Karna (died c. 1092 CE) continued to rule after Durlabha's death. Moreover, the earlier and more reliable texts such as Prithviraja Vijaya do not mention any such conflict. It is possible that Durlabha achieved a minor military success against Karna, which was magnified into a major victory by the later panegyrists.  Death  Durlabha seems to have faced Muslim invasions, most probably from the Ghaznavids, whose king was Ibrahim. The Prithviraja Vijaya states that he was killed in a battle with the MƒÅtangas. According to Jonaraja's commentary on the text, the word \\"MƒÅtanga\\" refers to mlechchhas, that is, Muslims. Hammira Mahakavya, written several years later, claims that Durlabha captured a Muslim ruler named Shahab-ud-Din, but this does not seem to be historically accurate. Durlabharaja III was succeeded by his brother Vigraharaja III.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.  Early life  Vigraharaja III, also known as Visala or Bisala, was a son of the Chahamana king Chamundaraja. He succeeded his brother Durlabharaja III on the Chahamana throne.  Alliance with the Paramaras  The name of Vigraharaja's queen was Rajadevi, as attested by the Bijolia rock inscription. The epic poem Vigraharaja Raso claims that he married Rajamati, the daughter of the earlier Paramara king Bhoja. However, Bhoja had died in 1055 CE, nearly 25 years before Vigraharaja's ascension. Historian R. B. Singh theorized that Bhoja's brother Udayaditya may have given his niece in marriage to Vigraharaja. According to Dasharatha Sharma, she might have been a daughter of Udayaditya. Vigraharaja thus formed a matrimonial alliance with Udayaditya, the Paramara king of Malwa. The Prithviraja Vijaya states that he gave a horse named Saranga to Udayaditya, with whose help Udayaditya was able to defeat his rival Karna. Thus, Vigraharaja helped the Paramara king establish peace and prosperity in Malwa. The later text Surjana Charita also corroborates this account, but wrongly credits Vigraharaja with defeating Karna. Vigraharaja is also said to have visited Ujjayini in Malwa to worship Shiva.  Conflict with the Ghaznavids  The Hammira Mahakavya claims that Vigraharaja defeated Shahab-ud-Din, the king of Malwa. This is not historically accurate, because the Muslims did not rule Malwa until the beginning of the 14th century. According to historian R. B. Singh, Shahab-ud-Din may have been a general of Ibrahim of Ghazna.  Death  According to Prabandha Kosha, Vigraharaja was a lustful man, and forcefully took away the wife of a Brahmin named Mahasatya. A curse by Mahasatya ultimately led to his death. Prithviraj Raso, another legendary text, claims that he raped a Vaishya girl who was praying the goddess Parvati. The girl's curse turned him into a demon named Dhundha. Because these two texts were composed centuries after Vigraharaja's death, it is hard to determine the historical accuracy of these legends. Vigraharaja was succeeded by his son Prithviraja I.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country, which included parts of present-day Rajasthan in north-western India.  Early life  Prithviraja succeeded his father Vigraharaja III on the Chahamana throne. The 1105 CE Jinamata inscription gives his title as Parama-bhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara, which indicates that he was a powerful king.  Military successes  The Prithviraja Vijaya claims that a band of 700 Chaulukyas came to Pushkara Tirtha to rob the Brahmins during the reign of Prithviraja I. The Chahamana king defeated and killed them. This legend may be a reference to Prithviraja's conflict with either Karna or Jayasimha Siddharaja, the Chaulukya kings of Gujarat. However, because the text does not provide any additional information, this cannot be said with certainty. The Prabandha Kosha states that Prithviraja \\"pulled away the arms\\" of one Baguli Shah. This probably refers to his repulsion of a Ghaznavid invasion. Minhaj-i- Siraj, in his Tabaqat-i Nasiri, mentions that during the reign of Mas'ud III, the Ghaznavid general Hajib Taghatigin raided India, going beyond the Ganga river. It is possible that Baguli Shah was a subordinate of Hajib Taghatigin.  Religious activities  Prithviraja appears to have been a Shaivite. According to the Prithviraja Vijaya, he built a food distribution centre (anna-satra) on the road to Somnath temple for pilgrims. He also patronized Jainism. Vijayasimha Suri's Upade≈õƒÅmƒÅlavritti (1134 CE) and Chandra Suri's Munisuvrata-Charita (1136 CE) state that he donated golden kalashas (cupolas) for the Jain temples at Ranthambore.

It exists of evidences of human settlement of hunter-gatherers and in the ultimate phase primitive farmers. The site is situated on the Bogot√° savanna, the relatively flat highland of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense close to the present-day course of the Bogot√° River at an altitude of above sea level. Aguazuque is just north of another Andean preceramic archaeological site; the rock shelter Tequendama and a few kilometres south of Lake Herrera. The artefacts found mostly belong to the preceramic period, and have been dated to 5025 to 2725 BP (3000 to 700 BCE). Thus, the younger finds also pertain to the later ceramic Herrera Period. There were some difficulties in dating of the uppermost layer due to modern agricultural activity in the area; the sediments of the shallower parts were disturbed. At Aguazuque multiple palaeoantropological finds have been made; stone and bone tools, remains of fireplaces and a multitude of pre- Columbian foods, primitive circular housing, various burial sites of individual and group interments and in the youngest dated layers, evidences of ceramics. The site represents a transition from a hunter-gatherer culture towards the earliest evidence of agriculture. A phase of settlement is attested where the people moved away from the caves and rock shelters and started inhabiting open area grounds. Investigation of Aguazuque has been conducted since 1986, mainly by archaeologist Gonzalo Correal Urrego who published the results of his studies in the book Aguazuque - evidencias de cazadores, recolectores y plantadores en la altiplanicie de la Cordillera Oriental in 1990. La colonia vive en Canoas - El Tiempo Curriculum Vitae Gonzalo Correal Urrego  Etymology  The site Aguazuque is named after the Hacienda Aguazuque that was built west of the capital Bogot√° in the early 17th century.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 21  Background  The history of inhabitation of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense goes back to the prehistorical era. The oldest dated evidence of human settlement on the high plateau in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes has been found in El Abra, within the municipality of Zipaquir√°, Cundinamarca. At this rock shelter on the northern edge of the Bogot√° savanna, stone tools and chopper cores have been carbon dated at 12,500 years BP. Other early sites of inhabitation of the area have been discovered at Tibit√≥ (11,400 BP), Tequendama (11,000 BP) and Checua (8500 BP), with later settlements in Mosquera (3135 BP), Ch√≠a (3120 BP), Jun√≠n, Zipac√≥n and Tausa.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 9Groot de Mahecha, 1992 Younger ceramic artefacts were found around Lake Herrera, the namesake of the Herrera Period that is defined as from 800 BC to 800 AD. Chronology of pre-Columbian periods: Herrera and Muisca The period from 800 to 1537 AD, when the Spanish conquered this area, is characterised by one of the four grand civilisations of the Americas; the Muisca period. Soacha, today the most populated satellite city of the Colombian capital, was an important location for pre-Columbian settlement. Apart from Aguazuque, various other sites have been discovered in the vicinity of Soacha. For example, in 2014, the largest pre-Columbian town has been discovered in Soacha, with the remains of 2200 people, more than 600 ceramic pots and various spindles and tunjos. Herrera Period evidence in Soacha - El Espectador Largest Herrera Period village in Soacha Archaeologists uncover remains of pre-Columbian village in central Colombia Dating of the Soacha Herrera Period site The name Soacha is derived from the Muysccubun words for Sun; S√∫a (with the Sun god Su√©) and man; ch√°. Official website Soacha  Aguazuque  The elaboration of stone tools was performed using other pieces of chert The archaeological remains of Aguazuque were found in an oval elevated area west of the Bogot√° River, that forms a bend around this higher ground. Aguazuque is located on the southwestern part of the Bogot√° savanna and is surrounded by higher hills reaching altitudes of up to . The climate is cool, with an average temperature of .Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 13 Compared to other parts of the Bogot√° savanna, the area of Aguazuque has relatively little rainfall.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 14 Geologically, Aguazuque is located on an anticlinal part of the Eastern Ranges with sandstones of the Late Cretaceous Guadalupe Group outcropping nearby. The top sediments are of Late Pleistocene and early Holocene age and contain sandstones and claystones of the former Lake Humboldt and various beds of volcanic ash. Fossil remains of Pleistocene megafauna have been found in Mosquera and were dated to 20,000 years BP.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 16 The area of the site is and remains have been analysed to a depth of .Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 23 = Artefacts = The stone artefacts uncovered are very similar in character to those found at El Abra and Tequendama and consist of tools mainly made of chert from the Guadalupe Group. The tools comprise various kinds of scrapers, knives, perforating tools, burins, spokeshaves, maceheads and round mortars and flat milling stones. Most of the artefacts originate from the nearby chert, with some tools made from shales of the Villeta Group and more allochthonous basalt tools, coming from farther west, around the Magdalena River, provenance of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 30 Apart from tools, Aguazuque is characterised by a large percentage of flakes resulting from the lithic reduction; the process of elaboration of the tools; in total 3868 samples, between 60 and 70% of the lithic fragments found were of this type.Correal Urrego, 1990, pp. 35‚Äì53 Other artefacts found were made of bones and shells, such as beads, spear points, perforating tools, knives and scrapers. The latter formed the majority of bone tools found, accounting for 55 to 75% of the bone artefacts found.Correal Urrego, 1990, pp. 54‚Äì78 = Flora, fauna and diet = White-tailed deer formed the main meat in the diet of the inhabitants of Aguazuque In all of the layers of the Aguazuque site, remains of fauna have been uncovered. The fauna, part of the cuisine of the inhabitants of Aguazuque, consisted of mammals, reptiles, birds, fish and invertebrates such as gastropods, fresh water oysters and crustaceans. As at the other sites on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the main part of the diet of the people was formed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Other mammals included little red brocket (Mazama rufina), guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), crab-eating fox (Dusicyon thous), spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), ocelot (Felis pardalis), puma (Felis concolor), lowland paca (Agouti paca), Agouti taczamawskii, Dasyprocta, ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), western mountain coati (Nasuella olivacea), common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and collared anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla).Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 79 Reptiles consisted of the turtle Kinosternon postinginale and remains of caimans, indicating hunting in terrains much farther to the west; the Magdalena River.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 80Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 263 Fish was coming from the various lakes, rivers and wetlands dotting the Bogot√° savanna, that originally were part of Lake Humboldt. Fish remains consisted of Eremophilus mutisii, Pygidium bogotense and Grundulus bogotensis. Bird remains included the Andean guan (Penelope montagnii), Anatidae, Ralidae and the scaly-naped parrot (Amazona mercenaria). The invertebrates comprised Drymaeus gratus, Plekocheilus coloratus, Plekocheilus succionoides, fresh water oysters and fresh water crabs of the family Pseudothelfhusidae, possibly Neostrengeria magropa.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 113 In terms of species of flora, Aguazuque has provided evidence of early agriculture, based on seeds of Cucurbita pepo.Correal Urrego, 1990, p.248 Other plant remains were analysed as Hieronyma macrocarpa, Oxalis tuberosa, Dioscorea tr√≠fida and various remains of Bromeliaceae, Rubiaceae and Gramineae. Species of mushrooms suggest their addition to the diet of the hunter-gatherers of Aguazuque.Correal Urrego, 1990, pp. 249‚Äì250 = Burial sites = Stone mortars were used to grind pigments, prepare food and as pieces for the dead, evidenced in various burial sites at Aguazuque Within the area of Aguazuque, fifty-nine burial sites have been discovered, consisting of single, double and mass graves. The bodies were buried on either the right or the left side, or lying on their backs. As was common in the later Muisca mummification culture, the bodies were interred with their arms crossed over the thorax and the legs folded onto the abdomen. One of the collective sites contained the remains of 23 adults (men and women) and children.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 139 It has been theorised that these people fell victim to epidemics, of which in the remains no traces were found.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 259 The burial sites showed evidence of ritual and beliefs in afterlife; the bodies were surrounded by stone tools, such as scrapers and mortars, and some pieces were decorated with red or black colours. Food offerings, such as the meat of the white-tailed deer, guinea pigs and Tayassu pecari accompanied the buried.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 141 An isolated body was adorned with colourful painted pieces of rock.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 142 Similar to what has been found in Tequendama, some of the buried people may have been characterised by rituals of cannibalism.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 152 This is evidenced further by the discovery of mutilated and coloured skeletal remains in Aguazuque.Correal Urrego, 1990, p.153 Paleopathological analysis has provided information on the people; the average brain volume was around , spread from to and the body length around .Correal Urrego, 1990, pp.165‚Äì194 Osteoarthritis has been found in 73% of the individuals and other diseases such as sifilis, treponematosis, osteoperiostitis and osteoperosis were common.Correal Urrego, 1990, pp. 198‚Äì222 Different from remains of similar age found on the Altiplano, such as Gachal√°, Nemoc√≥n and Tequendama, where no evidence of caries was discovered, in Aguazuque the human dental remains showed ample evidence of caries.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 231 Electron paramagnetic resonance of tooth enamel has provided an age of 3256 ¬± 196 years BP.Dataci√≥n de restos f√≥siles humanos provenientes de Aguazuque y Checua (Cundinamarca) usando resonancia paramagn√©tica electr√≥nica (epr) - abstract - Universidad Nacional Burial sites of animals have also been found, where turtles, parrots and foxes were located in isolated small graves.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 237 = History of settlement = Salto del Tequendama The evidence for human settlements at Aguazuque consists of circular slightly excavated structures, surrounded by vertically inward inclined bones of deer, or poles of wood. The round areas had a diameter of between and and contained ash and carbon remains on the floor. Using animal and shell pigments, the floors were painted red or covered with sandstone fragments and volcanic ash. The remains of the houses were mostly circular, and near them were many fireplaces.Correal Urrego, 1990, pp. 237‚Äì244 The oldest evidence for settlement has been dated to 5025 ¬± 40 years Before Present (around 3000 BCE). This layer is followed by younger occupation dated at 3850 ¬± 35 years, 3400 to 2800 BP and the second-youngest zone at 2725 ¬± 35 years BP. The uppermost layer has been disturbed by modern agricultural activity and provided no dates. The different layers of Aguazuque were similar in character in terms of the tools found, and in the abundance of deer, the main meat for the inhabitants of the Bogot√° savanna. The sequence of the layers from bottom to top based on the abundance of guinea pig remains, showed that their presence as domesticated animals varied through time. The domestication of guinea pigs is also evidenced in nearby Tequendama. The percentage of hunted deer was highest in the uppermost layer where the caiman bones have also been found, suggesting a time of greater interaction with the lower altitude tropical zones of the Andes. The early evidence for agriculture has been found in the middle section of the sequence, as has been discovered in Zipac√≥n where the agricultural activity has been dated at 3270 years BP.Correal Urrego, 1990, pp. 256‚Äì264 Only in the uppermost beds, the evidence of ceramics has been found, that could be dated to Early Herrera; around 2800 years BP.Correal Urrego, 1990, p. 264  Named after Aguazuque  Aguazuque is featured as one of the names appearing in the grand-strategy video game Europa Universalis IV in the playable nation of the Muisca.Muisca names Europa Universalis IV - GitHub  See also  *List of Muisca and pre-Muisca sites *Tequendama, Tibit√≥, Checua *El Abra, Piedras del Tunjo, Lake Herrera, Herrera Period  References  = Bibliography = * * Category:Andean preceramic Category:Pre-Columbian archaeological sites Category:Archaeological sites in Colombia Category:Former populated places in Colombia Category:Muisca and pre- Muisca sites Category:Tourist attractions in Cundinamarca Department Category:Tourist attractions near Bogot√° Category:Soacha ","title":"Aguazuque"},{"id":"51783186","text":"Micaria pulicaria, the glossy ant spider, is a species of ground spider from the family Gnaphosidae with a Holarctic distribution. Description The cephalothorax is glossy black, although less iridescent than the opisthosoma, and marked with radiating white lines. The abdomen is very iridescent and shows two parallel, white lines across the prosoma, with three dots in a line along the posterior portion of the prosoma. The femora on legs I and II are black, while those on legs III and IV are dark brown. The body length of the females is 2.7‚Äì4.5 mm while for males it is 3‚Äì3.5 mm. Biology Micaria pulicaria is not ant hunting, although it associates with ants, and it quivers its front legs to mimic ant antennae which may help prevent it falling prey to those larger spiders which generally avoid contact with ants. The females enclose the eggs within a stiff sac resembling a rimmed pot and although she does not guard them, she does return frequently to check it. The adults have been recorded from early February to late November, although they may occur throughout the year. The main season is from late spring until mid-summer. Habitat Micaria pulicaria is found at ground level in a wide variety of habitats, although showing a marked preference for sandy sites. The preferred habitat has scattered stones or small beds of stones. In Great Britain it has been recorded from the warm, sunny parts of sandy heaths, chalk downlands, dunes and derelict land, but it has also been found in saltmarsh, sphagnum filled dune slacks, mossy areas in broad-leaved woodland as well as the expected stony, bare, dry habitats. Distribution Micaria pulicaria has a Holarctic distribution. In Europe it is found throughout, including Ireland and Iceland. In countries with good recording schemes, such as Great Britain, Denmark and the Czech Republic, the species is recorded as frequent and widespread.

A. J. Walling\\". Career Walling worked as a reporter for the newspaper Western Daily Mercury in Plymouth before working as the company's sales representative in western Cornwall. In 1891 in Plymouth he started a newspaper specialising in football. In 1893 he became editor-in-chief of the Bicycling News in Coventry. In 1894 he returned to Plymouth, where he participated in the April 1895 launch of the Western Evening Herald, Plymouth's first evening newspaper. In 1904 he became the managing director/editor of the Western Newspaper Company and joined the board of directors in 1915. In 1910 he became a magistrate in addition to his other work but resigned a few years later. He also chaired for some time Plymouth's Chamber of Commerce. In 1921 Sir Leicester Harmsworth (as owner of the Western Morning News) acquired The Western Daily Mercury from the Western Newspaper Company, which before the acquisition owned the Western Daily Mercury and the Western Evening Herald. Upon the acquisition, Walling resigned as managing director/editor from the Western Newspaper Company and became editor-in-chief of the weekly newspaper Western Independent, where he continued until his retirement in 1945. He remained on the board of directors of the Western Newspaper Company until his death in 1949. In addition to his editorial and managerial work, Walling wrote news stories, travel articles, biographies, short detective novels published as newspaper serials, and, in his later years, detective novels published in book form. His detective novel The Third Degree (1923) was adapted and published in book form by Albert Pigasse in France in the collection Le Masque under the title L‚ÄôAgenda de M. Lanson. Walling's first detective novel (not published first in serial form) was The Dinner Party at Bardolph's (1927), published in Paris in 1931 as Le Financier Bardolph and published by Mondadori in Milan in 1932 as Se a tavola. In 1932 there appeared in The Fatal Five Minutes Walling's recurrent protagonist Philip Tolefree, a private detective often asked by an insurance company to solve whodunit puzzles. The character Philip Tolefree has a friend, Scotland Yard's Inspector Pierce, who appears in many of the novels and engages in friendly competition with, and occasionally helps, Tolefree. Will Cuppy wrote a blurb for Walling's detective novel The Corpse with the Floating Foot. Family In 1894 Walling married Florence Victoria Greet. Robert Victor Walling was their son.

Known as the Cobdogla Irrigation Area, the district was governed directly by the state Department of Lands until December 1923 when local residents proposed that a district council be formed.Hosking, 1936, page 526 The district council was gazetted on 17 January 1924 with its seat being located in the township of Barmera. The district council consisted of two wards ‚Äì Barmera and Cobdogla which were represented by three and two councillors respectively.Matthews, 1986, page 44 In 1936, it was reported that produce grown within the district included currants, dried fruits, Lexia raisins and sultanas intended for direct consumption and muscatels grown specifically for wine production within the district and in other places including the \\"Barossa district.\\"Hosking, 1936, page 527 During the 1920s, a proposal to rename the district council as the ‚ÄòDistrict Council of Barmera‚Äô was discussed by the District council with the councillors representing the Cobdogla ward advising opposition to it. A referendum held in 1928 resulted in residents voting in favour of the proposal and the District Council petitioned the George Jenkins, the Minister of Local Government, to ask that the name change be gazetted. However, a cross-petition from residents opposing the name change was received and the Minister declined to allow the name change. The change of name was finally gazetted in 1937. In 1986, the council was described as covering an area of including subject to permanent water inundation, and having a population of about 4400 people. Primary industry consisted of viticulture where grapes were produced for wine production within both the Riverland and the Barossa Valley, and horticulture consisting of stone fruit production intended for canning and drying, and market gardens producing vegetables for sale in Adelaide.Matthews, 1986, pages 47-49 It was amalgamated with the District Council of Berri on 1 October 1996 to form the Berri Barmera Council.Berri Barmera Council, 2016 Chairmen The following persons were elected to serve as chairman of the council for the following terms:Matthews, 1986, page 46Hosking, 1936, page 528 *Charles Jesse Panter Bruce (1924) *Alan Harcourt Kelly (1928‚Äì39) *Cecil Claude Marcelin Chabrel (1938‚Äì39) *Donald Hamilton Brooke (1939) and (1943‚Äì45) *Bernard Revell Cant (1939‚Äì40) *lbenezer Farmer (1940‚Äì42) and (1946‚Äì48) *Eric Davies Sims (1942‚Äì43) *John Stewart MacDonald (1943‚Äì53) *Edward Norman Hill (1945‚Äì46) *Henry Gunter Anderson (1948‚Äì55) *Jack Victor Foot (1955‚Äì59) *John McNaught Aird (1959‚Äì60) *Sydney Edward Fletcher (1960‚Äì68) *Donald Davis Thomas (1968‚Äì71) *Denys Murray Trevelyan (1971‚Äì75) *Bruce John Scott Vasey (1975‚Äì87) Citations and references ;Citations ;References  Barmera Barmera Barmera Barmera ","title":"District Council of Barmera"},{"id":"51783268","text":"Christopher Robichaud (born October 21, 1973) is a Philosopher and Lecturer in Ethics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

He also teaches at the Harvard Extension School and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and in the past has taught at Texas A&M; University, the University of Vermont, and Tufts University. Robichaud often draws upon popular culture, movies, TV shows, and graphic novels to teach philosophical concepts. He is a frequent contributor in The Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture Series, with topics including the moral duties of superheroes, the ethics of making vampires, and the military ethics of the Kree-Skrull War. He was also contributing editor in the Dungeons and Dragons, The Walking Dead, and The Watchmen editions. In the classroom, he has championed the use of role-playing games such as a fictional zombie apocalypse to simulate real-time leadership and policy decision-making in times of crises or disaster. In 2014, Robichaud agreed to give an opening lecture at a reenactment of a Black Mass by the Satanic Temple at the Queens Head Pub on Harvard University campus organized by the Harvard University Extension School Cultural Studies Club. The topic of the lecture was religious liberty, and Robichaud planned to explore the ways in which society defines ideas such as hate-speech and tolerance. The event was widely criticized by local Catholic leaders and Harvard affiliates, including Harvard President Drew Faust, and was eventually canceled by the Cultural Studies Club as interest in the event greatly exceeded the bar's capacity. Robichaud grew up in Chardon, Ohio. In addition to his work in philosophy, Robichaud has pursued side projects in acting and music.

It derives its name from the fact that it consists of two sentences each simply denying what the other says. History A variation on the paradox occurs already in Thomas Bradwardine‚Äôs Insolubilia.Bradwardine, T. (1970), Insolubilia, pp. 304‚Äì305, in Roure, M.-L. (1970). ‚ÄòLa probl√©matique des propositions insolubles au XIIIe si√®cle et au d√©but du XIVe, suivie de l‚Äô√©dition des trait√©s de W. Shyreswood, W. Burleigh et Th. Bradwardine‚Äô, Archives d‚ÄôHistoire Doctrinale et Litt√©raire du Moyen √Çge 37, pp. 205‚Äì326. The paradox itself appears as the eighth sophism of chapter 8 of John Buridan‚Äôs Sophismata.Buridan, J. (2001), Summulae de Dialectica, tr. G. Klima, New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 971. Although the paradox has gone largely unnoticed even in the course of the 20th-century revival of the semantic paradoxes, it has recently been rediscovered (and dubbed with its current name) by the US philosopher Roy Sorensen,Sorensen, R. (2001), Vagueness and Contradiction, Oxford: Oxford University Press. and is now appreciated for the distinctive difficulties it presents.Greenough, P. (2011), 'Truthmaker gaps and the no-no paradox', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 82, pp. 547‚Äì563. Formulation The notion of truth seems to be governed by the naive schema: :(T): The sentence ' P ' is true if and only if P (where we use single quotes to refer to the linguistic expression inside the quotes). Consider however the two sentences: :(N1): (N2) is not true :(N2): (N1) is not true Reasoning in classical logic, there are four possibilities concerning (N1) and (N2): # Both (N1) and (N2) are true # Both (N1) and (N2) are not true # (N1) is true and (N2) is not true # (N1) is not true and (N2) is true Yet, possibilities 1. and 2. are ruled out by the instances of (T) for (N1) and (N2). To wit, possibility 1. is ruled out because, if (N1) is true, then, by (T), (N2) is not true; possibility 2. is ruled out because, if (N1) is not true, then, by (T), (N2) is true. It would then seem that either of possibilities 3. and 4. should obtain. Yet, both of those possibilities would also seem repugnant, as, on each of them, two perfectly symmetrical sentences would mysteriously diverge in truth value. Discussion Generally speaking, the paradox instantiates the problem of determining the status of ungrounded sentences that are not inconsistent.Herzberger, H. (1970), 'Paradoxes of grounding in semantics', The Journal of Philosophy 67, pp. 145‚Äì167 More in particular, the paradox presents the challenge of expanding one‚Äôs favourite theory of truth with further principles which either express the symmetry intuition against possibilities 3. and 4.Priest, G. (2005), 'Words without knowledge', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research 71, pp. 686‚Äì694. or make them acceptable in spite of their intuitive repugnancy.Sorensen, R. (2001), Vagueness and Contradiction, Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 165‚Äì184. Because (N1) and (N2) do not lead to inconsistency, a certain strand in the discussion of the paradox has been willing to assume both the relevant instances of (T) and classical logic, thereby deriving the conclusion that either possibility 3. or possibility 4. holds.Armour-Garb, B. and J. Woodbridge (2006), 'Dialetheism, semantic pathology, and the open pair', Australasian Journal of Philosophy 84, pp. 395‚Äì416. Such conclusion has in turn been taken to have momentous consequences for certain influential philosophical theses. Consider, for example, the thesis of truthmaker maximalism: :(TM): If a sentence is true, there is something that makes it trueArmstrong, D. (2004), Truth and Truth-Makers, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. If, as per possibilities 3. and 4., one of (N1) or (N2) is true and the other one is not true, then, given the symmetry between the two sentences, it might seem that there is nothing that makes true whichever of the two is in fact true. If so, (TM) would fail.Sorensen, R. (2001), Vagueness and Contradiction, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 176. These and similar conclusions have however been contested by other philosophers on the grounds that, as evidenced by Curry's paradox, joint reliance on (T) and classical logic might be problematic even when it does not lead to inconsistency.L√≥pez de Sa, D. and E. Zardini (2007), 'Truthmakers, knowledge and paradox', Analysis 67, pp. 242‚Äì250.

It was designed as a Docker management software product to provide an integrated DevOps solution for end- to-end container application delivery and operations. StackEngine was acquired by Oracle in December 2015.  History  StackEngine was founded in May 2014 by Eric Anderson, Robert Gordon, and Bob Quillin. As an early mover in the Docker management marketplace, StackEngine built enterprise-grade container management and automation products that helped organizations simply deploy, manage, and scale resilient applications. Silverton Partners and Live Oak Venture Partners both led the StackEngine seed investment and Series A rounds. The company launched out of stealth October 2014 to focus on products to address Docker operations.  Product  The StackEngine model-based Docker management software provided an integrated DevOps solution for end-to-end container application delivery and operation, all with an integrated GUI dashboard, service discovery, scheduling, and orchestration functions. StackEngine could be deployed into any on-premises, hybrid, public, or private cloud environments and scaled across thousands of hosts enabling users to start in the lab and scale out to full production. StackEngine launched the Container Application Center in June 2016 to eliminate the Docker operations bottleneck by helping ops teams (1) bootstrap Docker into production; (2) discover, visualize, and orchestrate small to large scale Docker deployments; and (3) intelligently automate change and configuration management for containers. StackEngine focused on automation as the answer. Containerization instantly shifted the problem up the stack away from low-level system configuration tools to application-level container management tools. With StackEngine, the product was designed to help deliver product faster, deploy more frequently, operate more reliably, and run wherever was most optimal.  Oracle Acquisition  On December 18, 2015, Oracle signed and closed an agreement to acquire StackEngine. All StackEngine employees joined Oracle as part of Oracle Cloud. Oracle announced the Oracle Container Cloud Service ‚Äì based on the StackEngine technology and built by the StackEngine team ‚Äì at Oracle OpenWorld 2016.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single cream-coloured flower with red markings. Description Caladenia ancylosa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide. A single flower is borne on a spike high. The dorsal sepal is erect, oblong to lance-shaped, long and about wide. It tapers near the end which terminates in a glandular structure long. The lateral sepals are oblong to lance-shaped, long, wide and end in a gland similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, about wide and taper to a point. The labellum is a broad egg-shape, curves forward, long and wide when flattened. The labellum is cream-coloured at its base but red nearer the tip. There are 7 to 10 pairs of calli along the edge of the labellum, decreasing in length towards its front. There are six rows of foot-shaped calli in the centre of the labellum, also smaller towards the tip. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 2006 and given the name Arachnorchis ancylosa. The description was published in Australian Orchid Research. In 2007, Gary Backhouse changed the name to Caladenia ancylosa and the change was published in The Victorian Naturalist.

Description Corymbia gilbertensis is a tree that typically grows to a height and forms a lignotuber. There is up to of rough, tessellated grey bark at the base of the trunk, smooth white to coppery or pale grey bark that is shed in small polygonal flakes or short ribbons above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have green to greyish green, egg-shaped to elliptical leaves that are long and wide on a petiole long. The crown of the tree has a mixture of juvenile, intermediate and adult leaves. The leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, dull or glossy, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle usually with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. The flowers are creamy white and the fruit is a woody cup-shaped to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming The Gilbert River ghost gum was first formally described in 1928 by Joseph Maiden and William Blakely in Maiden's book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus and was given the name Eucalyptus clavigera var. gilbertensis.

It sought the liberation and unification of Serb-inhabited territory in the Ottoman Empire. History In 1871, the Association for Serb Liberation and Unification was founded by members of the United Serbian Youth and other patriots from all over the Yugoslav lands. The \\"Association\\" established boards in Cetinje, Novi Sad, and Belgrade. Parallelly, the \\"Main Board\\" (Glavni odbor) existed in Kragujevac. This organization was founded in 1871, and was active from the beginning of 1872. It was specially established for ≈†umadija to work on plans for an uprising. Kragujevac was the most sophisticated of the provincial Serbian cities, and had an intelligentsia second only to Belgrade. The city was also a center of opposition, and in the early 1870s a group of oppositionists gathered around socialist Jevrem Markoviƒá. Among notable members of the Main Board for Serb Liberation were artillerist Sava Grujiƒá, artillerist Pavle ≈†afarik, officer Radomir Putnik, merchant Ja≈°a Markoviƒá, Jevrem Markoviƒá (the main initiator), and others. Milivoje Blaznavac, the leader of the Serbian Regency, a legitimist and political conservatist, decidedly refused proposals and plans of the United Serbian Youth, regarding the organization's project unrealistic and impracticable; that Turkey (the Ottoman Empire) was still strong and that Russia was against an uprising in the Balkans, and that the organization also had subversive intent against the regency. Blaznavac and Jovan Ristiƒá were alarmed by the establishment of the revolutionary organizations in Cetinje and Belgrade. The statute of the Main Board for Serb Liberation was made in the second half of December 1871, likely after the meeting between Jevrem Markoviƒá and Blaznavac. The members of the Main Board were chosen in January 1872. In the beginning of 1872, Ljubomir Durkoviƒá wrote ≈†tatut (\\"the Statute\\"), in which it is explained that \\"the Main Board for Serb Liberation was established by Serb patriots with the intention to through organized uprising destroy the Turkish lordship over the Serb lands ...\\". The second article states that this is possible to accomplish \\"only when Serbia enters in the absent war\\" and that therefore \\"the uprising will inflame under the flag of Milan Obrenoviƒá IV\\". This is a reflection of Blaznavac's demands that he managed to impose through groups of active officers on which he had considerable influence. Further, resources for realization of the program and organizational structure of the society is specified. In January 1872, the organization sent a letter to officer Jevrem Velimiroviƒá. In 1872, Jevrem Markoviƒá with the help of local representatives part of secret local boards of the Main Board established boards in Ni≈° and Leskovac. A local board was established in Pirot the same year as well. In April 1872 the Central Board of the organization began its project of military use for an uprising. Jevrem Markoviƒá was planned to be appointed main commander of the rebel bands in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1872 a revolutionary assembly was held in Novi Sad under the leadership of Svetozar Markoviƒá, the younger brother of Jevrem Markoviƒá. The organization sought to contact like-minded radicals in Romania and Greece. Their initiatives, however, did not work out. When Jovan Ristiƒá fell out in early November 1873, new Interior Minister Aƒáim ƒåumiƒá permitted for more freedom of press, leading the group of Liberals and leftists in Kragujevac that had earlier founded a cooperative printing venture (the Kragujevac Social Press established in March 1873) to start a Radical newspaper (Javnost).

Pre-history The first Congregationalists (or Independents as they generally called themselves) in Adelaide, led by Rev T. Q. Stow, met in a tiny building on North Terrace, Adelaide, and built their first chapel in Freeman Street (now Gawler Place), which opened for public worship on 1 November 1840. The second body of Congregationalists to form met in a small chapel in the north-west of Norwood from around 1840, and constructed a brick building in High Street, Kensington, on land contributed in 1844 by John Roberts (c. 1794‚Äì1875).Roberts, a large landowner, built and lived in \\"Maesbury House\\" in Chapel Street, Kensington, later the home of politician Hugh Fraser. Various ministers including T. Q. Stow and Rev. Thomas Playford (c. 1795‚Äì1873), father of the Premier, preached there until Rev. John Martin Strongman (c. 1815‚Äì1887) was appointed pastor in 1849. He drew large crowds, but left South Australia in 1853 without fanfare and never returned. Rev. Henry Cheetham took charge of the High Street church. Cheetham resigned from the High Street Church in May 1871 and Rev. William Nicholls was confirmed as his replacement in July. In September 1872 Cheetham was accepted as pastor of the church in Milang, where he served a grateful congregation until his death in 1881. Nicholls resigned in 1875, to be replaced by John Randall. By the end of the decade the church had no minister and the building was being used by the Bible Christian denomination. Clayton Church Clayton Congregational Church, Beulah Park, 1865 In November 1851 a breakaway group formed a separate church which met at Roberts's residence, \\"Maesbury House\\". Roberts, who was antipathetic to Stow, but later publicly reversed his opinion, may have led the breakaway in response to Stow's pastorate. They were still meeting at Maesbury House when their first pastor J. H. Barrow held a service there on 21 January 1854. An institute hall was hired for the first public meeting on 2 July 1854, and plans were made for a permanent chapel. The block of land settled on was on the corner of Kensington Terrace and East Parade, Kensington (now Portrush Road and The Parade, Beulah Park). The foundation stone for the building, which was designed by George Abbott, was laid on 5 June 1855 by Mr. Barrow. This was the original Clayton chapel, named at the suggestion or insistence of John Roberts, in memory of Rev. John Clayton (1754‚Äì1843) of London, whose three sons John, George and William were also Congregationalist ministers. The first service, held on 13 April 1856, was conducted by Revs. John Gardner (Presbyterian), Joseph Dare (Methodist), and T. Q. Stow. Barrow resigned in 1858 to help found The Advertiser, which he edited for 15 years, and after an interim when services were held by Stow, was succeeded by the Rev. John William Cooper Drane (1823‚Äì1864), who preached his first sermon on 6 February 1859. Later that year the Rev. Drane started preaching (also?) at the High Street Church, and also ran a college in George Street, Norwood, which moved in mid-1860 to Tavistock Street in the city. In December 1860 he left for Ipswich, Queensland, where he ministered for three years and died of consumption (tuberculosis) on 24 December 1864. He was succeeded by Rev. William Harcus, who arrived in South Australia in late November 1860, and was to follow Barrow as a journalist and editor. He was followed in May 1866 by Eliezer Griffiths, who had been serving several congregations in Port Denison, Queensland.He left South Australia for England in December 1872. A manse on Kensington Terrace (now Portrush Road) had been built in 1868. The Rev. Thomas Hope followed in May 1874. During his time considerable building work was undertaken: a schoolroom and vestry were built in 1876 to a design by Thomas English. Pipe organ and decoration for Thanksgiving Festival, 1903 The congregation had grown to such an extent that a new, larger church building was called for, to be erected in front of the existing building. Promised donations from E. T Smith, Gilbert Wood and others would meet around half the cost. A design by Cumming & Davies (whose previous work included the College Park Congregational Church) for a building seating 560 people was accepted and the foundation stone was laid by E. T. Smith on 27 June 1882. The building was completed and officially opened on 17 May 1883. The spire, at was the tallest in the colony. The old building became the Church Hall. The Sunday-school also grew in numbers, and a Young Men's Society and Young Christians' Union were founded and flourished. Hope resigned in August 1890, after sixteen years at Clayton. Rev. Henry George Nicholls was the next incumbent. His ministry at Clayton began on 3 May 1891, and served for twelve years; his last sermon was preached at Clayton on 6 August 1903, when he left to take charge of the Presbyterian church in Canterbury, Victoria. The Rev. Joseph Robertson M.A., fresh from a very successful ten years at Stow Memorial Church, succeeded him; the appointment of the Australian-trained Robertson was heartily endorsed by Nicholls. In 1897 the pipe organ was removed to the College Park church, and a new instrument, built by J. E. Dodd & Sons of Adelaide, was installed and opened by the church organist on 8 September 1897. This article includes a comprehensive technical specification of the instrument, as well as the pieces performed. C. Hope Harris produced a history of the church for its Jubilee in 1906. At his well- attended farewell, Robertson was quick to acknowledge the active support of deacons Sir Edwin Smith and Peter Wood, and the organist William Sanders, among others. The Rev. Ashley H. Teece, formerly of New Town, Tasmania, was inducted on 29 August 1909. At a special church meeting on 21 September 1910 broached the possibility of institutional work in the district. A contract was entered into in 1911 for the erection of a building to cost ¬£1,139. Two stalwarts of the church died: Sir Edwin Smith in December 1919 and Peter Wood two years later, and a pulpit was erected in their memory. On 20 April 1920, Teece resigned the pastorate. Rev. Percival Watson, who had been pastor of the Summer Hill, New South Wales, church commenced his ministry in December 1920. In April, 1925, Mr. Watson received a second call from the Wharf street Church. Brisbane, and felt obliged to accept. Arising from the suggestion of Rev. P. Watson, the Rev. C. C. Watts, assistant minister of Collins Street Independent Church, Melbourne, was called in July, and served until late 1929, when despite pleas from both Clayton and the newly formed Luhrs Road Church, South Payneham to remain, he accepted a call to Victor Harbor. The Rev A. C. Newbury, minister of the Chatswood, New South Wales, Congregational Church accepted a call to take over the pastorate, and was inducted into Clayton Church at the end of February 1930. He left for the Henley Beach church in October 1940. Rev. J. H. Ralph of Tasmania was offered the pastorate, but he declined, but Rev. T. Rees Thomas of Subiaco, Western Australia accepted and began at Clayton in February 1942. Late in 1947 he accepted a call to the City Church, Brisbane, where he served with distinction until 1981. Rev J. F. Dickinson (22 November 1900 ‚Äì 1975) was inducted to the pastorate on 5 September 1948 and served to 1955, when he took over the pastorate at Victor Harbor. In 1965 Clayton Church decided to establish Clayton Church Homes for the aged in Norwood, the first stage of which was opened in March 1968. In April 1973 the Norwood Wesley Methodist and Clayton Congregational churches formally merged, just four years before their parent churches combined as the Uniting Church in Australia, and Clayton became Clayton Wesley Uniting Church. In October 2000, St Morris Uniting Church and Clayton Wesley Uniting Church congregations amalgamated. Music Clayton Wesley Uniting Church, and before the amalgamation, Clayton Congregational Church and Norwood Wesley Church have a long history of using sacred music and choirs to enhance worship, build community, and reach out to and provide an ‚Äòentry‚Äô point for people to be involved in the Church and thus the life of faith. Current Director of Music, Mandy Hutchinson, oversees a budget that is used from time to time for regular Sunday worship service and particularly for special events like Christmas Eve and Easter Sunday, to welcome others into the Church's community. Organists include Pip Parkin, Matthew Atherton, and Ashleigh Tobin, supported by guest musicians, including singers Rachel Bruerville, Andrew Linn, Macintyre Howie Reeves, Victoria Coxhill, and pianist James Huon George.

They were first discovered in the mid-2000s and are the largest and most complex known DNA transposons. Polintons encode up to 10 individual proteins and derive their name from two key proteins, a DNA polymerase and a retroviral-like integrase. Properties A typical polinton is around 15‚Äì20 kilobase pairs in size, though examples have been described up to 40kb. Polintons encode up to 10 proteins, the key elements being the protein-primed type B DNA polymerase and the retroviral-like integrase from which they derive their name. Polintons are sometimes referred to as \\"self-synthesizing\\" transposons, because they encode the proteins necessary to replicate themselves. Most polintons also encode an adenoviral-like cysteine protease, an FtsK-like ATPase, and proteins with homology to the jelly-roll fold structure of viral capsid proteins. The presence of putative capsid proteins has prompted suggestions that polintons may be able to form virions under some conditions; however, this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Polinton sequences contain terminal inverted repeats characteristic of transposable elements, usually on the order of 100-1000 base pairs. They also possess a 6bp target site duplication sequence at the insertion site. Distribution Polintons have been detected in all groups of eukaryotes other than the Archaeplastida (containing red algae, green algae, glaucophytes, and land plants). They are particularly common in unikonts, a group that includes animals. The pathogenic parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, which causes trichomoniasis, has a unique genome composed of up to 30% polintons. Evolution The genetic network linking various types of Bamfordvirae viruses and selfish genetic elements, represented by labeled circles. Links between circles are color-coded by the gene whose sequence homology establishes the link. Early descriptions of polintons identified them as likely to be ancient, at least one billion years old and possibly associated with an early ancestor of modern eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses of known polinton sequences support this ancestry model and suggest that transmission of polintons is mainly vertical (though horizontal gene transfer of a polinton has been reported). The evolutionary relationships between polintons, double- stranded DNA viruses, and selfish genetic elements are complex. The first descriptions of polintons linked them by sequence relationship to linear plasmids, bacteriophages, and adenoviruses. More recently, relationships have been identified between polintons, virophages, and giant viruses. Polintons are increasingly thought to form one component of a complex genetic network linking selfish genetic elements in eukaryotic genomes with double-stranded DNA viruses. Through homology in at least one and usually several genes, polintons are evolutionarily linked to linear plasmids, virophages (especially Mavirus virophage, family Lavidaviridae), giant viruses (Megavirales), Ginger 1 transposons, Tlr1 transposons, transpovirons, eukaryotic viruses of the Adenoviridae family, and bacteriophages of the Tectiviridae family. The Maveriviricetes class of viruses is named after their resemblance to Maverick/Polinton transposons. All the viruses mentioned are united under Bamfordvirae for their double jelly-roll capsid. Some polinton-like viruses (PLVs) other than Tlr1 have also been identified, and are yet to be put into a taxon (presumably under Maveriviricetes). Discovery and nomenclature Giant transposable elements were originally discovered in the mid-2000s, beginning with the description of a novel family of retroviral-like integrase proteins which were then associated with transposable elements given the name Mavericks. Meanwhile, an overlapping class of transposable element was described under the name polintons, derived from the key proteins polymerase and integrase, by Vladimir Kapitonov and Jerzy Jurka. Both terms continue in common use. Because of their viral capsid-like proteins and self-replication abilities, it has been suggested that polintons are capable of forming virions and would properly be termed polintoviruses. However, this terminology is not yet accepted and awaits experimental validation of the virion hypothesis.

Built for the slaveholding Prewett family in 1810, it was established as a mule farm. It is located a few miles away from Columbia, and it overlooks Fountain Creek. History The house was built in 1810 by Lemuel Prewett, his wife Elizabeth and their 12 children. The Prewett raised mules on their farm; they also owned African slaves. After the Creek War of 1813‚Äì1814, the house was inherited by Lemuel Prewett's son Abner, and the Prewetts moved to Mississippi in the 1820s. The house was purchased by John Amis, his wife and their six children, in 1821. Amis, the owner of 16 slaves, served on the county court. In 1852, he died of cholera alongside his wife and his son John; the three of them were buried on the farm. The house was inherited by their daughter, Elizabeth Amis Cheatham, and her husband, John Cheatham. The house was purchased by James I. Finney, Sr. in 1935.

The bars often provide funding for a team's uniforms and equipment, and often a free drink for each player, in exchange for advertising the establishment on the uniform and usually naming rights to the team itself. Beer leagues can be of virtually any sport but are usually amateur and recreational in nature, not being tied to a larger competitive league system, and contested by adults. The consumption of alcohol is often encouraged during the contest, as the actual competition is secondary. This is beneficial to the adults that compete in these beer league events because not only are they supporting a small business but are also getting physical activity, all while being social. For example, in Beer League Hockey, over 174,000 adults play. The primary goal of these leagues is to have \\"organized hockey in its purest form, unencumbered by money, skill, ambition, fans or advancement.\\" The phrase \\"beer league\\" can occasionally be used as a colloquialism for any sports league where alcohol is consumed, regardless of whether a bar or similar business is the sponsor.

Tuxis Island is about in area, and covered mostly in trees. The island's elevation is above sea level. Tuxis Island was formed by glaciers, a fact that is evident by the many glacial potholes and small boulders on the south of the island. The island itself is made mostly of granite, like most of the other islands nearby, although there is some sand. Two other islands, Gull Rock and Round Rock, are relatively close to Tuxis, as is Madison Reef to the south, and several unnamed rocks and islets. These landforms are sometimes associated with the Thimble Islands. The name Tuxis comes from the Native words Tuxisshoag and Tuckshishoag. Tuxis Island is closed to people without permission from May to August to protect the many species of birds that nest there. Tuxis Road in Madison Connecticut was also named after the island. History The first people on Tuxis Island were the Hammonasset people. Tuxis Island has had various owners dating back to 1674. The current owners are the Madison Beach Club and a private shellfishing company. The New Haven YMCA ran a camp named Camp Jewell on the island for nine years, from 1901 to 1910. In 1914, a congressman by the name of Thomas L. Reilly requested a breakwater to be built from the west tip of Tuxis Island to Round Rock, and northwest towards the Madison Wharf. Flora and fauna Most of the animals seen on Tuxis Island are birds. There are about fifteen species of birds that nest on Tuxis, including geese, egrets, herons, seagulls, ospreys, and oystercatchers. Some smaller mammals, amphibians, and reptiles can be found here as well. The waters surrounding the island are home to several species of fish. Shellfish and other invertebrates can be found living on and around Tuxis Island. The forest on Tuxis Island is mainly deciduous, with the occasional evergreen tree. Grasses, ferns, mosses, lichens, and some small shrubs are among the plants that constitute the undergrowth. Many algae cling to the rocks offshore. Fungi can be found here as well, due to the seaspray and tree cover creating a cool, damp environment. Folklore According to the Algonquin, a giant named Odziozo formed Tuxis Island when he scooped up a handful of rocks from the mainland and flung it into the Sound. The resulting splash filled up the hole, creating Tuxis Pond. A rock that fell out of his hand became Samson Rock, which he stepped on when turning to go back home, resulting in a large footprint-shaped indent in the rock. Later, colonists from Europe assigned the same legend to Samson (thus the name of the rock), from the Bible.

It is used for public events. The former presidential palace, now used as municipal offices, is on its south side. History The area was created by the decision of the First Secretary of the Central Committee of Communist Party of Kazakhstan Dinmukhamed Kunayev, since an increase in population of the city, the Lenin Square during festival events could not accommodate all the residents of the city. The area opened in 1980 under the name Brezhnev Square (after Leonid Brezhnev) in honor of the 60th Anniversary of the founding of the Kazakh Republic. It has become the main square of the capital of Kazakhstan and until the collapse of the Soviet Union it was a place for mass demonstrations, celebrations, festivals, military parades, rallies, festivals. The area was planted with deciduous and coniferous trees. In 1981, Kunayev and party workers planted 70 Tien Shan firs along the walkway area. In 1986, an infamous uprising known as Jeltoqsan occurred in the square. Where a group of crowd gathered to protest over Kunayev's dismissal. The events lasted from 16 December until 19 December 1986. The protests began in the morning of 17 December, as a student demonstration attracted thousands of participants as they marched through Brezhnev Square across to the CPK Central Committee building. As the result, internal troops and OMON forces entered the city, violence erupted throughout the city which around 200 people were killed. In 1992, the basic, most important and favorite holiday was celebrated in the square. For the first time began to celebrate Nauryz. Unlike before, during Perestroika where the holiday was only allowed to celebrate at the Lenin Square. Every year on 22 March, from morning to midnight thousands of Almaty residents came to the square to celebrate the national holiday of the vernal equinox - Nauryz. In the square, every year on March 22, tents were put out, which sold baursaks, leather, rice and soft drinks. Festive concerts were also held by famous Kazakh stars. Parades in honor of the 50th anniversary of the victory in the Second World War and the 5th anniversary of the Independence of Kazakhstan took place on the square on 9 May 1995 and 16 December 1996 respectively. In 2007, the square began construction of underground shopping and entertainment center, which demolished granite platform. Because of the construction zone, 60% of the area was closed by a fence, a large number of the Tien Shan fir trees were cut down, the movement of vehicles became limited. Before 2012, a symbol of independence for all Kazakhs - the Republic Square was disfigured by pits and wells. Residents negatively reacted to the construction, as the celebration of Nauryz was impossible for it to be held. In 2012, the construction of the underground shopping center was finally over, however the celebration of Nauryz was still restricted until 2014 which the celebration was finally allowed. List of architectural monuments The area previously had a status of state monuments of architecture and urban planning. In 2015, it was ruled into the State list of historical and cultural monuments of local importance in Almaty. * Akimat of Almaty Residence (the former Communist Party of Kazakhstan) * Residence of the First President of Kazakhstan (former Presidential Palace of Kazakhstan from 1991-1997) * Republican Schoolchildren's Palace (the former Republican Palace of Pioneers) * Independence Monument Name From 1980, the area was named as New Square, in 1982 the area was renamed to Brezhnev Square as a tribute to the death of Leonid Brezhnev. On April 1, 1988 a published decree of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet and the USSR Council of Ministers changed the name from Leonid Brezhnev back to New Square again. On May 23, 1990, the Supreme Council of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic adopted a resolution to rename New Square to Republic Square.

The weakness they target are the medical devices of a hospital. This was covered extensively in the press in 2015 and in 2016.Hacking Healthcare IT in 2016 Medical device hijacking received additional attention in 2017. This was both a function of an increase in identified attacks globally and research released early in the year. These attacks endanger patients by allowing hackers to alter the functionality of critical devices such as implants, exposing a patient's medical history, and potentially granting access to the prescription infrastructure of many institutions for illicit activities. MEDJACK.3 seems to have additional sophistication and is designed to not reveal itself as it searches for older, more vulnerable operating systems only found embedded within medical devices. Further, it has the ability to hide from sandboxes and other defense tools until it is in a safe (non-) environment. There was considerable discussion and debate on this topic at the RSA 2017 event during a special session on MEDJACK.3. Debate ensued between various medical device suppliers, hospital executives in the audience and some of the vendors over ownership of the financial responsibility to remediate the massive installed base of vulnerable medical device equipment. Further, notwithstanding this discussion, FDA guidance, while well intended, may not go far enough to remediate the problem. Mandatory legislation as part of new national cyber security policy may be required to address the threat of medical device hijacking, other sophisticated attacker tools that are used in hospitals, and the new variants of ransomware which seem targeted to hospitals. Overview In such a cyberattack the attacker places malware within the networks through a variety of methods (malware-laden website, targeted email, infected USB stick, socially engineered access, etc.) and then the malware propagates within the network. Most of the time existing cyber defenses clear the attacker tools from standard serves and IT workstations (IT endpoints) but the cyber defense software cannot access the embedded processors within medical devices. Most of the embedded operating systems within medical devices are running on Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows XP. The security in these operating systems is no longer supported. So they are relatively easy targets in which to establish attacker tools. Inside of these medical devices, the cyber attacker now finds safe harbor in which to establish a backdoor (command and control). Since medical devices are FDA certified, hospital and cybersecurity team personnel cannot access the internal software without perhaps incurring legal liability, impacting the operation of the device or violating the certification. Given this open access, once the medical devices are penetrated, the attacker is free to move laterally to discover targeted resources such as patient data, which is then quietly identified and exfiltrated. Organized crime targets healthcare networks in order to access and steal the patient records.  Impacted devices  Virtually any medical device can be impacted by this attack. In one of the earliest documented examples testing identified malware tools in a blood gas analyzer, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system, computerized tomogram (CT) scan, and x-ray machines. In 2016 case studies became available that showed attacker presence also in the centralized PACS imaging systems which are vital and important to hospital operations. In August 2011, representatives from IBM demonstrated how an infected USB device can be used to identify the serial numbers of devices within a close range and facilitate fatal dosage injections to patients with an insulin pump in the annual BlackHat conference.Hei X., Du X. (2013) Conclusion and Future Directions. In: Security for Wireless Implantable Medical Devices. SpringerBriefs in Computer Science. Springer, New York, NY Impacted institutions This attack primarily centers on the largest 6,000 hospitals on a global basis. Healthcare data has the highest value of any stolen identity data, and given the weakness in the security infrastructure within the hospitals, this creates an accessible and highly valuable target for cyber thieves. Besides hospitals, this can impact large physician practices such as accountable care organizations (ACOs) and Independent Physician Associations (IPAs), skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) both for acute care and long term care, surgical centers and diagnostic laboratories. Instances There are many reports of hospitals and hospital organizations getting hacked, including ransomware attacks, Windows XP exploits, viruses, and data breaches of sensitive data stored on hospital servers.. = Community Health Systems, June 2014 = In an official filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Community Health Systems declared that their network of 206 hospitals in 28 states were targets of a cyber-attack between April and June of 2014. The breached data included sensitive personal information of 4.5 million patients including social security numbers. The FBI determined that the attacks were facilitated by a group in China and issued a broad warning to the industry, advising companies to strengthen their network systems and follow legal protocols to help the FBI restraint future attacks. = Medtronic, March 2019 = In 2019 the FDA submitted an official warning concerning security vulnerabilities in devices produced by Medtronic ranging from Insulin pumps to various models of cardiac implants. The agency concluded that CareLink, the primary mechanism used for software updates in addition to monitoring patients and transferring data during implantation and follow-up visits, did not possess a satisfactory security protocol to prevent potential hackers from gaining access to these devices. The FDA recommended that health care providers restrict software access to established facilities while unifying the digital infrastructure in order to maintain full control throughout the process. Scope Various informal assessments have estimated that medical device hijacking currently impacts a majority of the hospitals worldwide and remains undetected in the bulk of them. The technologies necessary to detect medical device hijacking, and the lateral movement of attackers from command and control within the targeted medical devices, are not installed in the great majority of hospitals as of February 2017. A statistic would note that in a hospital with 500 beds, there are roughly fifteen medical devices (usually internet of things (IoT) connected) per bed. That is in addition to centralized administration systems, the hospital diagnostic labs which utilized medical devices, EMR/EHR systems and CT/MRI/X-ray centers within the hospital. Detection and remediation These attacks are very hard to detect and even harder to remediate. Deception technology (the evolution and automation of honeypot or honey-grid networks) can trap or lure the attackers as they move laterally within the networks. The medical devices typically must have all of their software reloaded by the manufacturer. The hospital security staff is not equipped nor able to access the internals of these FDA approved devices. They can become reinfected very quickly as it only takes one medical device to potentially re-infect the rest in the hospital. Countermeasures On 28 December 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration released its recommendations that are not legally enforceable for how medical device manufacturers should maintain the security of Internet- connected devices. The United States Government Accountability Office studied the issue and concluded that the FDA must become more proactive in minimizing security flaws by guiding manufacturers with specific design recommendations instead of exclusively focusing on protecting the networks that are utilized to collect and transfer data between medical devices.Medical Devices : FDA Should Expand Its Consideration of Information Security for Certain Types of Devices : Report to Congressional Requesters.

In Israel, Navon enrolled in the Israel Defense Forces and pursued his graduate studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, earning a master's degree and a Ph.D. in international relations. During his studies at the Hebrew University, he consulted to the Israeli Foreign Ministry on the reform of the United Nations and joined the Shalem Center as a doctoral fellow. = Career = Navon began his career as consultant for Arttic (a consultancy specialized in R&D; funding), helping Israeli companies obtain funding from the European Commission and join European consortia. Between 2003 and 2005, he served as CEO of BNIC, an NGO that trained Israel's business leaders in public diplomacy.Sandy Cash, \\"Boardroom Diplomacy\\" The Jerusalem Report, 2 May 2005 Between 2005 and 2010, he was a partner with the Navon-Levy Group, a consultancy that promoted Israeli agricultural projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2011 and 2016, he served as head of the Political Science and Communication Department at the Jerusalem Haredi College (affiliated with Bar- Ilan University). = Academic positions = Navon has been lecturing at Tel- Aviv University's School of Political Science, Government and International Relations and at the Abba Eban Graduate Program for Diplomacy Studies since 2002. In addition, he has been lecturing since 2012 at the IDC's Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy. He teaches and has taught classes on Israel's foreign policy, on foreign policy decision-making, on the history of diplomacy, on European diplomacy, on globalization, and on the global politics of oil and energy.Emmanuel Navon's LinkedIn Profile In 2013, he joined the Kohelet Policy Forum (a public policy think tank) as a senior fellow,Emmanuel Navon's Staff Page at the Kohelet Policy Forum. and in 2017 he joined the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS) as a research fellow. In his 2006 policy paper for the Herzliya Conference, Navon described Israel's public diplomacy as \\"soft powerlessness\\" and warned about international de- legitimization campaigns.Elise Hannaford, \\"Cautioning Israeli Policy Makers: The Consequences of Failed Negotiations\\" Palestine-Israel Journal, February 2014 In his January 2017 policy paper for the Kohelet Policy Forum (co- authored with Abraham Diskin), Navon recommended the adoption of open lists and political alliances in Israel's voting system. = Media and public speaking = Emmanuel Navon addresses the CIISS Emmanuel Navon is engaged since 2012 by i24News as a senior analyst for international affairs. Navon is widely cited by international media outlets and has made appearances addressing an international audience in three different languages. In English media his opinion has been cited by the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, Bloomberg, Sky News,The Financial Times, and the The Fiscal Times.Riyadh Mohammed, \\"Clinton or Trump: Which Candidate Would Israel Choose?\\" The Fiscal Times 5 May 2016 He has been interviewed or debated Israeli foreign policy with other figures in English media broadcasts such as on the Voice of America,VOA, 27 October 2015 and Al-Jazeera. French language media outlets similarly turn to Navon for his position on Israeli issues. He has been cited by France 24, Le Figaro, Lib√©ration,\\"Le casse-t√™te d'Olmert face au Hamas\\" Lib√©ration 26 February 2008 Le Point, France Culture,France Culture, 15 November 2012 Les Echos, RFI, L'Obs, Radio Canada,Radio Canada, 19 May 2015 La Libre Belgique,La Libre Belgique, 25 November 2014 and Le Monde.Le Monde, 4 August 2015 Hebrew language or English language Israeli media also have turned to Navon for his policy positions. His perspective has been quoted by the Knesset Channel, the Army Radio, Ynet, the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation, and the The Jerusalem Post.The Jerusalem Post, 15 November 2015 Navon has also appeared on Chinese media China Central Television and Xinhua. Navon's op-eds have appeared in Newsweek,\\"The Academics Boycotting Israel are Misguided\\" Newsweek 28 October 2015 Le Monde,\\"La vraie signification du vote onusien\\" Le Monde 20 septembre 2011 Le Figaro,\\"L'Europe a-t-elle peur de la d√©mocratie?\\" Le Figaro 7 ao√ªt 2002 The Jerusalem Post,\\"The EU Is an Obstacle to Peace in the Middle East\\" The Jerusalem Post 1 February 2012 Globes, The Marker, Israel Hayom, Makor Rishon, Yediot Aharonot, and Maariv. He regularly publishes on Israeli politics for The Times of Israel (in English) and is a former contributor to Mida, an Israeli current affairs and opinion web magazine. Navon is a frequent guest speaker in North America and Europe on behalf of organizations such as the Jewish Federations of North America, Hillel International,\\"Houston Hillel hosts scholar in residence\\" 18 February 2016 and ELNET.https://elnetwork.eu/2eipc/ In March 2011, a lecture Navon delivered at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQ√ÄM) was disrupted by pro- Palestinian students, and Navon had to be escorted by security guards. In November 2012, RTBF journalist Eddy Caekelberghs cut short a live interview after Navon accused him of contributing to Hamas' propaganda.RTBF, 15 November 2015 In 2019, Navon was invited by the Haute √©cole p√©dagogique (HEP) du canton de Vaud to present his approach to the Palestinian refugee problem, after an outcry caused by HEP's original plan to only invite speakers identified with the Palestinian narrative. In July 2020, Navon clashed on Turkish TV channel ANews with a journalist who had claimed that the West Bank was stolen by Israel. \\"That land was not stolen, as opposed to the land your country stole from Cyprus and from Syria\\" Navon replied.  Ideas and controversies  = International Relations = Navon is critical of international relations theory and describes the \\"great debates\\" as a sham.Chris Brown and Kirsten Ainley (eds.)., Understanding International Relations (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), p. 63 His dismissive attitude toward IR theory has been rebuked by international relations scholars Duncan Bell and Brian C. Schmidt. Duncan Bell's rebuke of Navon's critical approach to IR theory is often quoted in academic literature.Alex Prichard, Justice, Order and Anarchy: The International Political Theory of Joseph-Pierre Proudhon (Routledge, 2013).Oliver J√ºtersonke, Morgenthau, Law and Realism (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 7Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse, Beth A. Simmons (eds.), Handbook of International Relations (Sage, 2012)Chris Clarke, Ethics and Economic Governance: Using Adam Smith to Understand the Global Financial Crisis (Routledge, 2016), p. 148Knud Erik Jorgensen, Tonny Brems Knudsen (eds.), International Relations in Europe: Traditions, Perspectives, and Destinations (Routledge, 2006), p. 248John Buke, Realpolitik: A History (Oxford University Press, 2016), p. 316 Navon is a defender of free-markets and of globalization.\\"Globalisation: Mythes et R√©alit√©s\\" Akadem, May 2012 He advocates the use of Israel's technological edge to contribute to energy independence,\\"Isra√´l et la g√©opolitique du p√©trole\\" Akadem, March 2011 a position for which he was criticized by Prof. Yehezkel Dror. A supporter of the preservation of NATO and of the EU, Navon is suspicious of Russia and had opposed Brexit.I24News Interview, 23 June 2016 Navon approves of Israel's \\"divide and rule\\" policy towards the European Union (i.e. developping special ties with the Visegrad Group so as to block unanimous votes by the Council of the European Union on Israel and the Middle East), yet he also warns that \\"Israel should not overplay that card\\" because \\"for all its failings, a unified European market aligned with the U.S. is more in Israel's interest than a divided continent ruled by pro-Russian mercantilists.\\" = Arab-Israeli Conflict = Navon describes the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as \\"Catch 22\\" situation. He thinks that the preservation of Israel's Jewish and democratic character requires territorial changes but does not believe that an agreement can be reached with the Palestinians. He also dismisses unilateral territorial withdrawals (such as the 2005 Gaza disengagement) as too risky. Navon claims that the two-state solution \\"keeps working in theory and failing in practice.\\" Navon is of the opinion that Israeli settlements are not illegal, that the Palestinians' claim for a \\"right of return\\" to Israel is groundless in international law and incompatible with a two-state solution, and that only Israel has guaranteed religious freedoms and protected the holy sites of the three Abrahamic religions in Jerusalem. In November 2005, Navon rebuked Israel's \\"New Historians.\\"\\"Les nouveaux historiens isra√©liens\\" Akadem, November 2005 In April 2010, he criticized the JCall initiative for overlooking the responsibility of the Palestinian leadership in the deadlock of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process.Andrew Rettman, \\"Jewish luminaries petition EU parliament over settlements\\" EU Observer 3 May 2010 In October 2016, Navon responded to Hagai El-Ad's call for Security Council action against Israel's presence in the West Bank. In 2020, Navon expressed his support for the Trump peace plan and for the extension of Israeli sovereignty to parts of Judea and Samaria. Navon rejects the claim that partial Israeli annexations beyond the \\"green line\\" are incompatible with international law and with a two-state solution. = Nationalism and Democracy = Navon claims that the Jews are not only a religion but also a nation and that they are therefore entitled to national self-determination.La Libre Belgique, 25 November 2014 He considers Zionism a national liberation movement and argues that one cannot challenge the legitimacy of the Jewish nation-state without doing the same for all nation-states. Navon is of the opinion that nationalism in general, and Jewish nationalism (Zionism) in particular, are compatible with democracy and with civic equality. Hence did Navon support the Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People while, at the same time, conceding that the principle of civic equality should be explicitly enshrined in Israel's quasi-constitutional basic law. Navon is a fierce critic of anti- Zionist Jews such as Mike Marqusee and Eitan Bronstein Aparicio. He has published reviews of their books in which he challenges their arguments. = Judicial Activism and Electoral Reform = Emmanuel Navon addresses the 2020 Jerusalem Conference Navon is critical of Israel‚Äôs judicial activism and of Aharon Barak‚Äôs self-proclaimed ‚Äúconstitutional revolution.‚Äù In his book The Victory of Zionism: Reclaiming the Narrative about Israel‚Äôs Domestic, Regional, and International Challenges, Navon claims that Israel‚Äôs constitutional order and separation of powers were overhauled in the 1990s by five dramatic changes introduced unilaterally by the High Court of Justice under Barak‚Äôs leadership: 1. Proclaiming that everything is ‚Äújusticiable‚Äù and therefore that no public issue is immune from the court‚Äôs review; 2. Ending the ‚Äústanding‚Äù (or locus standi) requirement, thus allowing anyone to petition the court; 3. Declaring that the court is entitled to strike down legislation deemed inconsistent with Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúbasic laws;‚Äù 4. Overruling government decision for being ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù in the court‚Äôs opinion; 5. Turning the legal advice of the Attorney General into binding decisions by which the government must abide. Navon suggests legislating a Basic Law that would regulate, re- balance, and formalize Israel‚Äôs separation of powers and the court‚Äôs ability to strike down legislation and government decisions. While he does not oppose judicial review, Navon believes that its modus operandi in Israel has been shaped in a radical and unilateral manner and must be redrawn via a Basic Law supported by a large majority. Navon also suggests implementing two reforms in Israel‚Äôs electoral system to increase accountability and predictability: 1. Open lists; 2. Political alliances. According to Navon, open lists produce more accountability than first-past-the-post (FPTP) elections; he also claims that FPTP is not suited to Israel‚Äôs heterogenous society and would not gather enough support in the Knesset anyway. Navon also suggests formalizing political alliances via legislation to improve the correlation between the vote for a party and the choice of a prime minister.  Politics  In November 2012, Navon ran for Knesset on the Likud ticketGil Hoffman, \\"Self- described 'Franglo' running for Likud List\\" The Jerusalem Post, 24 August 2012. but he did not gather enough votes in the party's primary elections. He endorsed Fran√ßois Fillon for the first round of the 2017 French presidential elections and Emmanuel Macron for the runoff.I24News Interview, 24 November 2016 In December 2019, Navon endorsed Gideon Sa'ar for the leadership of Likud.  Personal life  Navon grew-up in a secular Jewish family but became Modern Orthodox in his early 20s. He is married to Sima Herzfeld and has four children. Navon is the brother of French author Val√©rie Mr√©jen and the brother-in-law of US rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld. Navon's maternal grandfather was an officer in the French army and a secret agent in the French resistance, whose life was saved by a German officer.

He was a preeminent figure in the study of discomycetes and made significant contributions to the field of fungal nomenclature and taxonomy. Korf was Professor Emeritus of Mycology at Cornell University and Director Emeritus of Cornell University's Plant Pathology Herbarium.  Early life and education  Korf was born on May 28, 1925, to an upper-middle-class family with homes in Westchester County, New York, and New Fairfield, Connecticut. While attending the prestigious Riverdale Country School in New York City, Korf was placed in charge of his biology class after their teacher joined the military. \\"In retrospect,\\" Korf wrote, \\"I am convinced that this experience had an enormous impact on my future and on my decision to enter the teaching profession.\\" In 1942, shortly after his 17th birthday, Korf enrolled at Cornell University \\"with the vague notion that [he] might like to become a gentleman farmer.\\" At the suggestion of botany professor Loren C. Petry, Korf began studying plant pathology under Herbert Hice Whetzel. Korf continued his training under mycologist Harry Morton Fitzpatrick, whom he nicknamed \\"Prof Fitz.\\" Korf completed his B.S. in botany in 1946 and doctorate in plant pathology and mycology with minors in genetics and general botany in 1950.  Contributions to mycology  = Professorship = Following the completion of his doctorate, Korf spent a year teaching mycology at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He returned to Cornell in 1951 as a faculty member in the Department of Plant Pathology. He was named Associate Professor in 1955 and Professor of Mycology in 1961. He retired in 1992 but continued to teach until 1998, when he was replaced by Kathie Hodge. Korf trained and advised 27 PhD students, including Lekh Raj Batra, William C. Denison, K. P. Dumont, James Kimbrough, Donald H. Pfister, Martin A. Rosinski, Robert L. Shaffer, Robert A. Shoemaker, and Wenying Zhuang. = Herbarium = Korf was Director Emeritus of the Cornell University Plant Pathology Herbarium (CUP), one of the largest fungal herbariums in the United States. Korf traveled globally over the course of his career, collecting fungi in Belgium, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Macaronesia, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Scotland, Singapore, Sweden, and Taiwan. The Richard P. Korf Herbarium within CUP boasts nearly 5000 specimens, including 257 type specimens. This collection is dominated by taxa of particular interest to Korf: Arachnopeziza, Calycella (now Bisporella), Cheilymenia, Chlorosplenium, Dasyscyphus, Hyaloscypha, Hymenoscyphus, Mollisia, Orbiliaceae, Peziza, Rutstroemia, Scutellinia, and Trichophaea. = Mycotaxon = Korf co-founded Mycotaxon, an international peer-reviewed journal of taxonomy and nomenclature of fungi and lichens, with co-worker Gr√©goire L. Hennebert in 1974. Korf oversaw journal preparation, final editing, and subscription management as Managing Editor & English Language Editor (1974-1991) and Business Manager (1991-2006). He served as Assistant to the Editor-in-Chief from 1998 to 2003 and as Treasurer of the Corporation from 1999 to his passing in 2016. Mycotaxon reached 131 published volumes in 2016. = Taxa described = Korf described or reclassified hundreds of species of fungi. The standard author abbreviation Korf is applied to taxa he described.  Personal life  While on sabbatical in Japan in 1957, Korf met his wife Kumiko \\"Kumi\\" Tachibana. Her younger sister was a student in his English conversation group at Yokohama National University. They married and had four children together: Noni, Mia, Ian, and Mario. Kumi is a fine artist specializing in printmaking. In the 1960s, Korf chaired the Liberal Party of Tompkins County, New York. In 1972, Korf purchased Exe Island on Big Rideau Lake in Portland, Ontario, Canada. He later transferred the three acre island with cottage to Mycotaxon, Ltd. as Exe Island Biological Station. Korf enjoyed the card game Crazy Eights, and is remembered for organizing tournaments at mycological conferences and during holidays on Exe Island. Korf passed away on August 20, 2016 at the age of 91 at home in Ithaca, New York.  Thespian activity  Korf was an active thespian with a lifelong enthusiasm for theatre arts. Performing in plays since childhood, he acted on Cornell and Ithaca stages and in the recording studio. Korf performed under the pseudonym \\"Jonah Webster\\" as a student to hide his \\"favorite avocation\\" from professor Harry Morton Fitzpatrick, who disapproved of non-mycological pursuits. Korf served part-time as chair of Cornell's Department of Theatre Arts from 1985 to 1986.  Honors, awards, and memberships  In November 2015, the journal Ascomycete.org published a Jubilee tribute issue in honor of Korf's 90th birthday. = Eponymous taxa = * Anthracobia korfii S.

This list of birds of Kentucky includes species documented in the U.S. state of Kentucky by the Kentucky Bird Records Committee (KBRC) of the Kentucky Ornithological Society through November 2019. As of September 2020, one more species has been documented but not yet assessed by the KBRC. Of these 391 species, 105 are classed as accidental and six were introduced to North America. Four are extinct and three have been extirpated. An additional nine species are hypothetical as defined below. Birds that are considered probable escapees, although they may have been sighted flying free, are not included. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following tags are used to designate some species: *(A) Accidental - A species on the Kentucky review list, for which the KOS requires documentation *(E) Extirpated - a species which no longer occurs in Kentucky but exists elsewhere *(X) Extinct - a recent species that no longer exists *(I) Introduced - a species established solely as result of direct or indirect human intervention *(H) Hypothetical - species with only sight records or questionable reports, which also require documentation Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Canada goose Wood duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, bills which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to special oils.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single white or cream-coloured flower with red markings and black tips on the sepals and petals. Description Caladenia anthracina is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber surrounded by a fibrous covering. A single hairy, dull green, lance-shaped leaf, long and wide appears above ground in May or June, following rain. A single flower, in diameter is borne on a densely spike high. The dorsal sepal is erect, linear to oblong, long, wide and tapers near the end to a thick, black tip. The lateral sepals are lance- shaped, long, wide and taper towards a black tip similar to the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, wide and also taper to a black point. The labellum is a broadly egg-shaped when flattened and curves forward, long and wide and is strongly curved towards the tip. It is white to cream-coloured and there are four to six rows of dark reddish-purple calli along in the centre part and short, blunt teeth along the edge. The column is long and translucent with reddish markings and narrow wings. Flowering occurs between late September and early November. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by David L. Jones in 1998 and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected near Ross. The specific epithet (anthracina) is a Latin word meaning \\"coal-black\\" referring to the glands on the ends of the sepals and petals. Distribution and habitat Caladenia anthracina is only known from an area of in the Midlands where it grows in grassy woodland in sandy soil.

Therefore, a jurist's score will continuously change, unlike static measures of ideology such as the Segal‚ÄìCover score and Judicial Common Space score. Martin-Quinn scores are among the most commonly used measures of judicial ideology. History and method  The concept of the Martin-Quinn score was published in a 2002 paper by Andrew D. Martin and Kevin M. Quinn. The Martin- Quinn score uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit a Bayesian model of ideal points. The ideal points can change over time due to the item response model. MQ scores are theoretically unbounded (have no minimum or maximum values). MQ scores are dynamic, as each decision made by a judge creates another data point that can be integrated into the model. The MQ score places the justices on a continuum of more liberal to more conservative. As of 2007, scores roughly ranged between -6 and 4, with the lowest score of about -6 attributed to William O. Douglas (tenure on the USSC from 1939 to 1975) and the highest score of about 4 attributed to Clarence Thomas (tenure from 1991 to present). Ward Farnsworth wrote that while the MQ model has ingenuity and promise, it falls short of proving what it aims to. He criticized the methodology of MQ scores, saying that MQ scores only take into account whether a judge affirms or reverses a ruling, and not the ideological outcome their action supports. In part, \\"the relationship between the spectrum generated by the [Martin-Quinn] model and the spectrum of policy decisions in the real world is a matter of guesswork. There is no inherent relationship between them. Application MQ scores were initially developed to measure and compare current and former US Supreme Court justices. They have since been applied to the judicial systems of other countries, including Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

Major works  Upholding Justice - Society, State, and the Penal System in Quito (1650-1750) In this 2004 revised edition of her first book Herzog is using a combination of legal and historical analysis and challenges the traditional paradigm of an all powering colonial state. Her research reveals a dynamic interaction between the administration and society, where social network, reputation, and morality guide the work of individuals involved in making justice. Upholding Justice demonstrate the impossibility of studying crime without understanding the system that administered its prosecution and punishment. Defining Nations - Immigrants and Citizens in Early Modern Spain and Spanish America In this 2003 book Herzog explores early modern categories of citizenship and belonging. Challenging the theories that communities were either the natural result of common factors such as language or religion, or that they were artificially imagined, Herzog reexamines how Spaniards constructed their communities on both sides of the Ocean. She argues that the distinction between Spaniards and foreigners came about as local communities distinguished individuals who were willing to take on the rights and duties of membership in that community from those who did not. She demonstrates that, rather than states replacing local communities, local citizenship persisted in the early modern period, the Spanish state in both Europe and the Americas consisting of a conglomerate of local communities, each defining its own citizens. Herzog also argues that if we followed her analysis, which reads from conflict what ordinary life were like, we may be able to apply this reinterpretation also to the English, Italian, and French cases, which so far were studied by using a different methodology. Frontiers of Possession - Spain and Portugal in Europe and the Americas In this 2015 book described as \\"ground breaking work\\"http://digitalcommons.asphs.net/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1207&context;=bsphs and \\"pioneering approach\\", Herzog asks how territorial divisions were established in Europe and the Americas during the early modern period and challenges the standard view that boundaries between polities were largely determined by military conflicts or treaties. Focusing on Spanish and Portuguese claims in the New and Old Worlds, Herzog reconstructs the different ways land rights were discussed and enforced, sometimes violently, among ordinary people who vindicated old rights or envisioned obtaining new ones. Questioning the habitual narrative that starts with Europe in order to understand the Americas, Herzog begins in the Americas, where settlers, military men, governor and missionaries had to decide who could settle the land, who could collect fruit, and who had river rights. She examines how these individuals dealt with the presence of indigenous peoples, whom they classified as enemies to vanquish or allies to befriend. In Europe, meanwhile, the formation and re-formation of boundaries could last for centuries, as demands to respect ancient entitlements clashed with changing economic, political, and legal conditions. Herzog demonstrates that territorial control was subject to ongoing negotiations confronting members, neighbors, and outsiders. A Short History of European Law: The Last Two and a Half Millennia In this engaging book, Herzog offers a comprehensive, yet brief, summary of the development of European law from Roman times to the emergence and establishment of the European Union. Herzog embraces the history of both common and civil law, and demonstrates how colonialism contributed to their emergence and expansion. This great journey across time and space targets both specialists and non-specialists, both historians and lawyers. The aim is to give students, scholars and even a broader audience a solid and at the same time inspiring introduction to the political, social, and cultural roots of law as well as the impact of law upon society. In this survey, Herzog stresses the constructed character of the law and its context-dependency. She makes a powerful case for why this history is important not only to understand the past, but also to acquire instruments to understand the present.  Academic awards  * James A.

Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, and John Hannah. A central action scene sees a car chase featuring Coulson's flying car Lola and Robbie Reyes's (recurring guest Gabriel Luna) \\"Hell Charger\\" Lucy. The episode also guest stars Jos√© Z√∫√±iga as Reyes' uncle, as backstory for the Ghost Rider character is explored, as well as seeing Axle Whitehead return as J.T. James to continue the season's Inhuman and Watchdogs storyline. It is part of the first \\"pod\\" of eight episodes for the season, subtitled Ghost Rider. \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\" originally aired on ABC on October 18, 2016, and was watched by 4.78 million viewers within a week of its release. The episode received a positive critical response, with praise going to the car chase, the episode's use of James, and its balance of the season's various storylines.  Plot  While looking at apartments for herself and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Leo Fitz, agent Jemma Simmons comes across former agent Daisy Johnson, now the Inhuman vigilante Quake, injured. Simmons tends to Johnson's injuries while the latter explains that she has been tracking the Watchdogs terrorist group, who she believes has hacked into S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äôs list of registered Inhumans. Johnson wants access to the list as well, to see who the Watchdogs' next target is. Agent Phil Coulson visits Elias Morrow in prison to ask him about his work at Momentum Energy labs; Morrow's co-workers there appear to have been killed in an explosion and returned as ghosts. Coulson promises to get Morrow released if he cooperates, but Morrow refuses. Outside the prison, Morrow's nephew Robbie Reyes arrives to also ask his uncle about Momentum, but agent Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie recognizes Reyes as the vigilante Ghost Rider, and he and Coulson chase Reyes in Coulson's car. The chase ends when Reyes drives into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s invisible quinjet, and the agents take Reyes into custody. Coulson convinces Reyes to help their investigation into Momentum by speaking to Morrow on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s behalf, and he learns that Momentum's misfortunes came about from studying a mysterious book, the Darkhold. With Simmons' help, Johnson discovers that the Watchdogs have hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list using tracking wristwatches given to all registered Inhumans. The next Inhuman on the list is J.T. James, an Inhuman with explosive abilities who spent time with Johnson under the influence of the parasitic Inhuman Hive. Johnson and Simmons remove James's wristwatch, but he betrays them to the Watchdogs with the promise that they would kill him once he helped destroy the other Inhumans‚ÄîJames hates himself and his Inhuman identity. Before they can investigate the Darkhold, Coulson and Mack are alerted to James's wristwatch being removed, and arrive along with Reyes to help Johnson and Simmons fight off the Watchdogs and arrest James. Coulson, Mack, Simmons, Johnson, and Reyes join up with agent Melinda May, who has been recovering from a mysterious illness, to go find the Darkhold. Her recovery was overseen by Aida, the new assistant of S.H.I.E.L.D. ally Holden Radcliffe, and Simmons immediately recognizes Aida as an android.  Production  = Development = Promotion for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s fourth season at San Diego Comic Con featured flaming chains, leading to speculation that the series would be introducing the character of Ghost Rider. Though this speculation turned out to be true, with Gabriel Luna cast in that role and introduced with the start of the season, some commentators noted that the series already featured a character who wielded a flaming chain, Axle Whitehead's James. In October 2016, Marvel revealed that James would also be returning for the season alongside Luna's Ghost Rider, with both characters set to appear in the fourth episode of the season. Titled \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\", a line from the Jimi Hendrix song \\"Fire\\", the episode was written by Matt Owens, with Brad Turner directing. Owens previously wrote for the Marvel Netflix series Luke Cage. \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\" is part of the season's Ghost Rider \\"pod\\" of episodes, consisting of the first eight episodes. = Casting and writing = In October 2016, Marvel confirmed that main cast members Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, Ming-Na Wen as Melinda May, Chloe Bennet as Daisy Johnson / Quake, Iain De Caestecker as Leo Fitz, Elizabeth Henstridge as Jemma Simmons, Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, and John Hannah as Holden Radcliffe would be starring in the episode. Following the airing of the previous episode, executive producer Jed Whedon teased that \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\" would explore the dynamic between Luna's Ghost Rider, Robbie Reyes, and Elias Morrow, his uncle, but would be \\"pivoting from the storyline in the comics. We‚Äôre pulling the characters, the character names and the relationships, but I think you can already feel that we‚Äôve changed it. Those dynamics will be entirely different. We‚Äôre using them as inspiration.\\" Guest star Axle Whitehead returns from the third season as the Inhuman J.T. James. In addition to Luna as Reyes and Whitehead as James, guest stars for the episode include Mallory Jansen as Aida, Jos√© Z√∫√±iga as Morrow, Kerr Smith as Joseph, Phil Tyler as watchdog #1, Sergio Enrique as guard, Tanner Fontana as Elliot and Lilli Birdsell as Lucy. Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from earlier in the series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are \\"still in our world, so we still have some of these people in the mix ... but right now we‚Äôre on the Ghost Rider kick.\\" On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy \\"for everyone involved. Daisy has made it very clear that she doesn‚Äôt want to be with our team. There‚Äôs all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this is a guy who has never had a team, and probably doesn‚Äôt function well within one. We‚Äôll see pretty quickly that it‚Äôs an uneasy alliance and it‚Äôs going to cause a lot of drama.\\" Discussing Simmons' actions in the episode, Henstridge noted that the previous episodes in the season had established the character's new position high in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy so that this episode could see her abuse that power, using her position to help her friends, including the now ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Johnson, rather than the agency of its director. Henstridge said that \\"this is the whole reason that she [got herself into a position of power] but it is a turning point for because in that moment she could've gone the other way\\" and chose to protect her new position. Henstridge appreciated the episode exploring the relationship between Simmons and Johnson, feeling that there was \\"so much bad blood\\" between them after the events of the third season that could be explored. She compared this to a relationship between sisters. = Filming and effects = The episode's central car chase features Coulson's flying 1962 Chevrolet Corvette, Lola, chasing Reyes' fiery \\"Hellcharger\\", a 1969 Dodge Charger nicknamed Lucy. The sequence was filmed in Los Angeles, with location scouting for the sequence beginning by searching for an ideal corner for the Charger to make \\"a big hard left\\". The streets around the corner were then augmented with directed traffic in a \\"near-miss configuration\\", to make the sequence more dynamic‚Äîit sees the Charger weaving between the other vehicles, and them veering away in the opposite direction for added effect. One stunt sees a large truck backing out of a driveway, with the stunt team timing it so that the Charger can drive around the back, but the much smaller Lola has to drive underneath it. In the episode's climactic fight between Reyes and James in a fireworks factory, a moment sees James burn through a brick wall, and the two falling into the factory below. The sequence was choreographed with two stunt doubles descending through a fake wall on wires, but on the day the filming schedule was changed and there was no longer time to set up the wire rig. Instead, the stunt team had the doubles fall through the wall without wires, and land on pads below, which stunt coordinator Tanner Gill said ultimately \\"worked really effectively\\". For the subsequent fireworks factory explosion, a practical explosion was created by the series effects team, and then CG fireworks were added by Pixomondo. The practical explosion shook all the stages around the ABC Studios lot.  Release  \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on October 18, 2016. Ahead of the episode's airing, Marvel released a teaser poster depicting Ghost Rider and his Hellcharger, with the pod's promotional title Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Ghost Rider. The poster was drawn by comic book artist Francesco Francavilla. Luna promoted the episode as Lola vs. Lucy, referring to the episode's car chase. The episode began streaming on Netflix, along with the rest of the fourth season, on June 15, 2017.  Reception  = Ratings = In the United States the episode received a 0.7/3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.7 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 2.34 million viewers. Within a week of its release, \\"Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire\\" had been watched by 4.78 million U.S. viewers, above the season average of 4.22 million. = Critical response = Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe praised the chemistry between the series' main characters and the performance of Jansen as Aida, but said \\"most of this is just preamble to the sight of two guys with a lot of attitude and similar pyrokinetic powers unleashing holy hell on one another in a building chock full of explosives. I am than okay with this.\\" The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy graded the episode a 'B', praising the episode for focusing the season's overarching storyline and for the emotional reunions between Johnson and the core S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. He was positive of the ongoing Ghost Rider storyline and the episode's action sequences, but thought Aida's story was \\"the much more intriguing long-term story ... it offers the unusual opportunity for Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. to dig into some juicy subtext and weighty concepts\\". Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt the line \\"had to see that coming\\" applied to many elements of the episode, but said \\"there‚Äôs a lot of fun to be had\\" and praised the use of the character James, dealing with the character's \\"self-loathing\\" well while acknowledging his status as the series' pre-Ghost Rider Ghost Rider. Fitzpatrick added that he was \\"still not crazy about whatever‚Äôs going on with ‚ÄúLucy‚Äù and her terrible ghost effects\\", and felt the Aida story was being pushed aside in favor of a seemingly corporate- mandated Ghost Rider focus. Terri Schwartz at IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.5 out of 10, praising the executive producers for their timing in bringing the season's different groups of characters together in this episode. Schwartz praised the car chase, the handling of the relationship between Simmons and Fitz in regards to his keeping Aida a secret from her, and the use of James, taking advantage of the audience's familiarity of him from the previous season. At Den of Geek, Marc Buxton scored the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, praising the episode for balancing all of its different plot lines. He appreciated the time spent with Johnson and Simmons, and called the car chase \\"an absolute blast\\". He felt the newly introduced origin for Ghost Rider was diluting the \\"elegance\\" of the source material, while Aida's storyline was \\"more effective\\" (though he said it \\"seems so redundant when compared to the utter perfect exploration of the same subject on Westworld). Collider's Evan Valentine gave the episode a \\"very good\\" 4 stars out of 5, calling it \\"wall- to-wall fun\\" and praising the car chase as \\"probably one of the highlights of the season so far for me\\", and calling the Ghost Rider vs. Hellfire fight \\"a blast to watch\\". Valentine also praised the episode's handling of Aida, and its balancing of the different stories and characters.

He began abstract art in the 1930s when he was a student at the Bunka Gakuin art school in Tokyo. Interacting with avant-garde artists and participating actively in Jiyu-ten (Free artist's exhibition) and other societies, YYK was at the mainstream of Japanese modern art movement. After the liberation of Korea, YYK led Korean abstract art as the founder of Neo Realism Group and Association of Modern Artists (AMA) along with Whanki Kim, Lee Kyusang, Han Mook, Hwang Yumsu and Park Kosuk. Mountain was his favorite motif and he earned the reputation as \\"the painter of mountains.\\" Often he was admirably called as \\"the magician of colors\\" because of the bold usage of vibrant colors in his paintings. In his paintings, nature is presented in non-figurative forms using strong lines and colorful planes, and elements of the painting; vibrant colors, metaphysical patterns, and well-planned structural composition are all integrated into a whole that shows the sublimity and solemnity of nature and even makes one to feel the absolute beauty. He had been a member of Korean Academy of Arts since 1979, and he persistently pursued his unique art world and strong work ethic as an artist. Early life YYK was born in Uljin County in the mountainous Gangwon province in 1916. He was from a relatively well-to-do family and his father Yoo Moonjong(‚Äì1946) was a landlord who provided substantial military provisions to general Shin Dolsuk at the end of the Korean Empire(1906) and established Jedong Elementary School (1922‚Äì1943) at Uljin. After the elementary education at Uljin, YYK moved to Seoul to enter Chei Kobo(The Second High School, currently Kyungbok Middle and High School). Under the Japanese occupation, Korean students were highly disciplined and keenly watched for misdemeanors by Japanese teachers and YYK was not an exception. However, Sato Kunio, the art teacher at Chei Kobo earned much respect from Korean students because of his open- minded and liberal personality, and it was his influence that the school produced many masters in Korean modern art. Student beating was not uncommon those days. On one occasion YYK was beaten by his teacher over refusing to spy fellow students, and he became more disenchanted with the repressive atmosphere of the school. Days after, he quit the school even though he was on his graduation year and went to Japan with the intention of entering a merchant marine academy at Yokohama to become an officer of the commercial cargo ship travelling the world. After realizing that high school diploma was required to apply for the school, he decided to enter the oil-painting department of the Bunka Gakuin College in Tokyo, an art school known for her liberal atmosphere and policies. Tokyo Period (1935‚Äì1943) The avant-garde movement of Japan started in the 1920s and by the time YYK arrived at Tokyo Russian futurism and constructivism were already widely permeated to the Japanese art scenes. Hasegawa Saburohttp://www.artnet.com/artists/saburo-hasegawa/past-auction- resultsHasegawa Saburo and Murai Masanarihttp://www.muraimasanari.com/Murai Masanari who had studied abroad in Paris were leading Japanese avant-garde movement after their returning to Tokyo. Work R3, 1938 (restored in 1979 by YYK's daughter Yoo Lizzy), mixed media, 65x70cm =Abstract Art= At Bunka Gakuin YYK decided to major in abstract painting even though there was no professor who could teach abstract art. However, he determined to study something completely different from the traditional painting, so he pursued his way to abstract art on his own. YYK made debut as an artist at the 7th exhibition of Independent Artists Association in 1937 and participated in Jiyu-ten by the association of free artists from the beginning, and won the grand prize at the second exhibition(1938) and became a fellow of the society. It was the prize that made him to participate in the mainstream of the Japanese avant-garde movement. Unfortunately, his works during this period were all lost during the Korean War except some of his relief works remaining in the form of postcards later reproduced by his daughter Yoo Lizzy(1945-2013), a metal craft artist herself. Those original reliefs were made in the late 1930s almost at the same time with Piet Mondrian and Jean Arp who led the Abstraction-Cr√©ation group in Paris, showing that YYK was keenly aware of the artistic movements around the world and participated in the cutting-edge movement. =Photography= YYK learned photography at Oriental Photography School in Tokyo and his photo works were exhibited at the Jiyu- ten. During the outbreak of the World War II, artists were forced to work on documentary war paintings in Japan and an artist such as Hasegawa Saburo, unwilling to comply with the policy, chose to work on photography. This might have affected YYK to some degree, but he later recollected that he learned photography as a means of living for the future. His photo works portrayed mostly historical remains of Gyengju the old capital of Silla (B.C.57‚ÄìA.D.935). The Blank Period (1943‚Äì1955) As the WW II neared to its end, YYK came back to Korea (1943) and married Kim Kisoon the following year. During the chaotic period of Korea to be liberated from the Japanese empire (1945) and to become an independent country, YYK captained a fishing boat owned by the family with about ten men crew and went out to the sea for fishing for years. In 1947, he was offered a job to work as a full-time instructor at the fine art department of the Seoul National University and moved to Seoul to resume his career as a (fine) artist. =Sinsasil-pa( Neo realism Group)= With Kim Whanki and Lee Kyusang, YYK started Sinsasil-pa and held the 1st exhibition at the Hwashin department store gallery in Seoul (1948), and the group activity continued till 1953 (the 3rd exhibition was held at Busan due to the breakout of Korean War in 1950). Even though the group was quite small in size, all the group members were experienced artists in Tokyo and their vision and manifesto left lasting impact on the Korean art circle. YYK was a key figure in establishing the character of Sinsasil-pa and also leading figure in overall Korean art scenes from the late ‚Äò50s to the early '60s in contextualizing and fixating modern art in Korea. Nature, and to be more specific mountains, began to appear as the motif of his work. Work, 1963, oil on canvas, 130x162cm =Korean War: The Dark Period= During the first three months when Seoul was occupied by the North Korean Army (June 28-Sep 28, 1950) and the following several months after the liberation of Seoul, YYK and his family had to endure extreme hunger and poverty. On the brink of the second occupation of Seoul by the North Korean Army in January 1951, YYK and his family escaped to his hometown, Uljin, but the economic situation was no better. There, YYK took over the brewery factory and a fishing boat of the family that were not operating for years and worked as an entrepreneur as well as a laborer. With good business skills and almost fierce efforts, YYK became one of the most prosperous men of the town within few years. However, YYK quitted the business at the peak of financial success and moved up to Seoul to paint again. During the ages between late twenties to early forties, YYK was out of his profession just to survive and support his family in the tumultuous social environment. Later, YYK regretfully recollected the period as \\"a lost decade\\". However, the brewery business, that he left to his younger brother, Yoo Youngjin, to manage, provided his family basic income through the years when his abstract painting was not a feasible means of making a living at all and allowed him to concentrate in his artwork. All of YYK's art works before the Korean war were destroyed during the war except two and the works exhibited at the 3rd Sinsasil-pa exhibition at Busan in 1953 were later found in deteriorated shapes and subsequently restored. Pursuing the Abstract Art When YYK returned to Seoul in 1955 and tried to resume his career as a painter, Korea during this period was close to an isolated country where neither information about world trend in fine art nor basic materials necessary for painting were available. YYK once mentioned that he colored his painting in red because it was the only available color. It was a metaphor that materials shortage of the time was quite severe, but it was also a period of radical polarization. Right after the paranoid of the Korean war, McCarthyism of the society was such that red color in painting was often confused with the support of communism. After serious thoughts on the future, YYK chose the mountain as the motif of his future work and pursued it in his own way. Artists in general moved to abstract art after experiencing figurative art, but YYK started abstract art from the beginning. He dissected natural image into basic forms and composed certain patterns when no Korean artists actually paid attention to abstraction Having not expected abstract paintings ever to become a source of income in his lifetime, he was virtually nonchalant to the need of local art market and used to say, \\"I will study painting up to sixty years old. After that, I will paint whatever I want\\". In fact, his paintings were sold for the first time when he became sixty years old and that was the moment when the Korean economy started to prosper. It was only after the 1960s that information on the artistic movement around the world became available through the art books imported from Japan. Becoming more aware of the greater arenas abroad, he participated in the Sao Paulo biennial in 1963 and the Congress for Cultural Freedom Invitational Exhibition in 1964. When Kim Whanki, who immigrated to U.S. the previous year, wrote him that in N.Y. artist work almost mechanically from nine to six at their studios as salary men do at their company, which was a rather admonishing remark on loose work habit and morale of Korean artists at the time, YYK responded that he could do the same at home. In fact, he had been already quite punctual with his painting schedule and put ten hours a day into his work until deteriorating health prevented him from doing so much later. YYK made regular trips, for four or five days about every five weeks, to Uljin to supervise the brewery firm, travelling through mountains of Kangwon-do and along the coastline of the East sea, and the travel gave him refreshments as well as artistic inspirations. However, extensive work in the standing posture damaged his hip joint, which combined with severe heart attack in 1976 virtually confined him to work sitting on a wheelchair. Work, 1963, oil on canvas, 130x162cm YYK was elected as the representative of Association of Modern Artists in 1961, but he resigned the post not long after to focus on the first solo exhibition scheduled in 1964. In the similar vein, he once held a teaching position at the Hongik university as a chairman of oil painting department (1966-1969), but resigned few years later and never returned to university again. YYK did not regard education as a mission of his life and all in his mind was to concentrate on painting to compensate for the lost decade. =1955‚Äì1958: Search in the dark= YYK became a founding member of Modern Art Society (from 1957) and the works made in this period showed several characteristics; complicated yet diverse dimensional composition, thick and strong outlines making rigid but geometrical forms, heavily painted primary colors delivering unique texture. Even though abstraction was the major focus that YYK delved into, semblance to the landscapes of Uljin and Jukbyun could be found in his works. =1958-1967: Absoluteness and freedom= Since 1958, the thick and strong lines disappeared and vivid color phases appeared on the canvas. The keen strokes often resembled the outbreaks of the Earth's crust and sharp diagonal lines brought dynamics on the canvas. The sharp contrast of colors and density of compositions are the main characteristic of YYK's work. Kim Byungki, the art critic and artist, once mentioned about this characteristic of YYK's work that \\"the energy, like when lava explodes from the crate, bursting out from the painting delivers inexplicable emotions to the viewers.\\" The lines traversing the canvas like flash of light enhance this sensation. Lee Il, the critic, wrote that the balance and harmony of colors in paintings suggested that YYK's usage of color reached a certain level of mastery, and Kim Youngjoo also depicted that his works carried the essence of our era. Compared to the previous works portraying the nature with strict composition, the works in this period deliver tensions with dynamics and motional senses freed from any rules that YYK explored in the previous era. Work, 1964, oil on canvas, 130x194cm =1968‚Äì1973: Geometric abstraction= In his 50s, YYK started to explore geometrical forms and primary colors. The thick and rough texture of the paints of the previous era disappeared and over all the calmness and stability were brought to the canvases. Primary and complementary colors were used to escalate the visual sensation, and lines intersecting the spaces diagonally, vertically, and horizontally imparted a sense of dynamism to the canvas where essential figurative elements of natural objects were extracted in their simplest forms and repeatedly duplicated to provide depth and perspective to the painting. Shades of the sunlight and spatial composition drawn as straight lines or main figures appearing as negative exposition inside the primary color field were typical characteristics of YYK's work of this period =1973‚Äì1979: Pastoral color fields= In 1977, YYK moved from Yaksu-dong where he lived for thirty years to Deungchon-dong, which was an outskirts of Seoul. The newly built house was very quiet and surrounded by a little hill at the back with many trees, and through the windows of the atelier he could see pheasants coming to rest in his backyard. Works belonging to this period were painted in gentler colors using softer lines, which provided intimacy and comfort rather than tension and rigor, compared to those made in previous years. Trees were often depicted as ‚ÄòY‚Äô shapes and mountains showed softer and rounder angles. =1978‚Äì1999: Peace and comfort= In his later years, YYK suffered from many kinds of illnesses. He used to be hospitalized for months at a time; for myocardial infarction (1976), thighbone fracture (1979), heart surgery(1983), hip joint surgery(1984), several strokes and so on. Even though deteriorating health severely limited his activities, YYK remained serene and sharp to the end. Almost defiantly, YYK refused to rest and said in an interview, \\"Now that I am getting old, I need more enthusiasms and stimuli to continue. When I stare at my paintings, I feel passionate tension, which fills me with some ardor and enthusiasm. I will train myself and paint with this kind of passion and enthusiasm to the end.\\" In his final days, he could work less than few hours a day on a wheelchair. The works created around this time, when he lived in Deungchon-dong and Bangbae-dong, bring the sense of tenderness and comfort because they are painted in pure colors and figures are presented in softer and gentler way more than ever. The screen has been flattened and the basic patterns; such as circles, triangles, and rectangles depicting sky, mountain, Sun, trees, etc. are repeated to deliver joy and delights of life. Work, 1994, oil on canvas, 66x91cm Death Even though YYK suffered quite severely from health problems after he became sixty years old, his work of this period remain in peace. That is more in conformity with the nature of YYK. In many occasions that could lead him to death, he was always calm and quiet. Kim Kisoon, his wife, recalled that YYK lived a life of his own and pursued his own way of living without clinging to longevity or reputation. He used to say, \\"I became a painter to live a free life not interfered by others. Why should I worry now?\\" YYK died on November 11, 2002, and the epitaph inscribed on his tombstone says, \\"the mountain stays in my mind.\\" YYK was a true pioneer in Korean abstract painting and modern art in general who insisted on absoluteness and freedom through the most turbulent years of modern history.

It is, in part, a continuation of Ethics & Animals (E&A;), a journal which ran from 1980 to 1984. Between the Species was founded as a print journal in 1985, published by the Schweitzer Center of the San Francisco Bay Institute/Congress of Cultures. The print version ceased publication in 1996. It was revived as an open access online- only journal in 2002. It is published by the Philosophy Department and Digital Commons at the California Polytechnic State University; Joseph Lynch is the current editor-in-chief.

A real-world journal by the name was first published from 1971‚Äì72. This had a small distribution not extending beyond the United States, and most of its contents were works by Abbe. The journal was revived, \\"in modified form\\", in 1985, with the publication of volume 1, issue 1 of Between the Species, a quarterly scholarly journal of philosophy, also featuring interviews, artwork of various forms, and autobiographies. The journal was published by the Schweitzer Center of the San Francisco Bay Institute/Congress of Cultures with funding from the Animal Protection Institute, and was initially edited by Abbe, Steve F. Sapontzis and John Stockwell.Stockwell, John (1985). \\"Editorial\\". Between the Species 1 (1): 1‚Äì2. In its early years, the journal had financial problems and issues were often released late. The editors were responsible for much of the production, which was done by hand: Stockwell explained that \\"In late 1984 [Sapontzis] bought a new ball for his dot-matrix printer, and dedicated part of his sabbatical year to typing out the articles that would appear in BTS. These he would print out in three inch wide continuous columns, which I would then cut with scissors and strip into pages, afterwards adding the graphics and titles.\\"Stockwell, John (1994). \\"Editorial\\". Between the Species 10 (1‚Äì2): 3, 80. The journal was primarily distributed to readers who were themselves a part of the animal rights movement.Shapiro, Kenneth (1994). \\"The caring sleuth: Portrait of an animal rights activist\\". Society & Animals 2 (2): 145‚Äì65. . Between the Species is partially a continuation of a journal named Ethics & Animals.

Ethics & Animals 1 (1): 1. Jeanne Keister and Suzie J.

Cave, Sidney Gendin, and Steve F. Sapontzis.\\"History\\". Society for the Study of Ethics and Animals. Accessed July 9, 2020. The journal was quarterly, and ceased publication in 1984 with issue 4 of volume 5. In his final editorial, Miller noted that mainstream philosophical journals would potentially publish ethical work on animals, and noted that readers of Ethics & Animals were specifically invited to submit manuscripts to Between the Species.Miller, Harlan B. (1984) \\"Editor's page\\". Ethics & Animals 5 (4): 87. The Society for the Study of Ethics and Animals says that Ethics & Animals \\"evolved into\\" Between the Species, though Between the Species is not published by the society.

Volumes 15 and 16, published in 2012 and 2013 respectively, were the journal's first special issues, publishing peer-reviewed versions of selected papers from two interdisciplinary conferences in animal studies. Volume 17, published in 2014, included the journal's first interview. 2018's volume 21 was a special issue dedicated in memory of Regan, who died in 2017.

Is he a poet or only a very subtle versifier? He seems at first to partake of both, but the lines which appear to lay most claim to the title 'poetry' are few and far between. He is illusive and allusive. His imagination always outstrips his verses. Either he cannot keep pace with the thoughts that race through his brain, or, having caught them, he lacks the complete art of putting them into expression. But now and again he gets very near to the perfect interpretation of a mood. And it is that near approach that bears a promise that the day is not far distant when Roderic Quinn will take a place in the front rank of Australian poets.\\"\\"Literary : The Hidden Tide\\", The Queenslander, 8 April 1899, p634 In The W.A. Record the reviewer was rather more enthusiastic: \\"Small in size is Mr. Roderic Quinn's \\"Hidden Tide\\" but the book contains an abundance of poetry of a very high order and poetry of an artistic class seldom produced in Australia. Amongst Australian poets Mr. Quinn holds a place of his own 'distinct and apart, for although he has strong points of resemblance to Henry Kendall and Mr. Daley, he has still stronger points of contrast. The poems in this booklet are preeminently the work of an artist soul; but the artist never loses the singer and the seer. Picturesque they are, but into the woof of his vivid art, Mr. Quinn has woven the weft of high emotion, an emotion that has been touched into life by the vivifying love of Nature, animate and inanimate.\\"\\"Review\\", The W.A.

Like their contemporary the 13th Floor Elevators, Leo and the Prophets experimented with psychedelic music and generated some controversary with their on-stage actions and attire. The band is best-remembered for their lone single \\"Tilt-a-Whirl\\", which also was subjected to scrutiny at the time of its original release on Totem Records in 1967. In more recent times, the song has been considered a classic of Texas garage music. History Former jazz guitarist Leo Ellis (lead guitar, vocals), in an effort to become popular with teenage audiences and immerse himself in rock music, formed the Prophets with garage rock group J.C. and the Boys. J.C. and the Boys (J.C. stood for Jesus Christ for an ironic play on the group's religious community) was established in 1965, and featured members Rod Haywood (bass guitar), Bill Powell (drums), Dan Hickman (rhythm guitar), and Travis Ellis (tambourine). The band, renamed Leo and the Prophets, performed regularly at the Jade Room in Austin and the Living Eye club in Houston, and also toured in other states such as Arkansas and New Mexico. Much of the group's psychedelic-tinged setlist and casual attire -- which both mesmerized and frustrated conservative audiences -- was inspired by their contemporary the 13th Floor Elevators, who often shared the bill with Leo and the Prophets. In April 1967, the band recorded and released the single \\"Tilt-a-Whirl\\", backed by \\"The Parking Meter\\", on Totem Records. Envisioned by Leo Ellis to be a dance-orientated song, \\"Tilt-a-Whirl\\" was banned by local radio stations for the lyric \\"I‚Äôve got a feeling/banana peeling/and the monkey‚Äôs showing through\\", which made an underlining reference to recreational drug use. The lack of publicity by pop radio stations ironically served to boost record sales and audiences at Leo and the Prophet's live performances hoping to hear the banned song. In early 1967, the band was recorded by deejays Bill Josey Sr. and Rim Kelley, just as the two were establishing their record label Sonobeat Records. Three original instrumentals, \\"Ozone Forest\\", \\"Prophecy of Love\\", and \\"Flowers on the Hill\\", were partially complete; however, no further recording sessions were scheduled for unknown reasons. Nonetheless, Kelley began promoting \\"Tilt-a-Whirl\\" on KAZZ-FM radio in the latter half of 1967 and \\"Flowers on the Hill\\" has since become accessible. Unexpectedly, Leo Ellis at an important gig in the New Orleans club, had a breakdown on stage and abruptly left before the band's performance concluded. Leo and the Prophets disbanded soon after. Although short-lived, the group has since been recognized for their lone single on multiple compilation albums. The band appears on albums such as Pebbles, Volume 10, Flashbacks, Volume 4, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 12, and Wyld Sides, Volume 5.
