A successor of the Mesolithic Kunda culture, Narva culture continued up to the start of the Bronze Age. The time span is debated. Zinkeviƒçius and the Fin.wikipedia assign it from ( to 1750 BC) (indirectly cited), Saag (2020) from 4410 to 4286 BC. The technology was that of hunter-gatherers. The culture was named after the Narva River in Estonia. Technology and artifacts Pottery of the Narva culture The people of the Narva culture had little access to flint; therefore, they were forced to trade and conserve their flint resources. For example, there were very few flint arrowheads and flint was often reused. The Narva culture relied on local materials (bone, horn, schist). As evidence of trade, researchers found pieces of pink flint from Valdai Hills and plenty of typical Narva pottery in the territory of the Neman culture while no objects from the Neman culture were found in Narva. Heavy use of bones and horns is one of the main characteristics of the Narva culture. The bone tools, continued from the predecessor Kunda culture, provide the best evidence of continuity of the Narva culture throughout the Neolithic period. The people were buried on their backs with few grave goods. The Narva culture also used and traded amber; a few hundred items were found in Juodkrantƒó. One of the most famous artifacts is a ceremonial cane carved of horn as a head of female elk found in ≈†ventoji. The people were primarily fishers, hunters, and gatherers. They slowly began adopting husbandry in the middle Neolithic. They were not nomadic and lived in same settlements for long periods as evidenced by abundant pottery, middens, and structures built in lakes and rivers to help fishing. The pottery shared similarities with the Comb Ceramic culture, but had specific characteristics. One of the most persistent features was mixing clay with other organic matter, most often crushed snail shells. The pottery was made of wide clay strips with minimal decorations around the rim. The vessels were wide and large; the height and the width were often the same. The bottoms were pointed or rounded, and only the latest examples have narrow flat bottoms. From mid-Neolithic, Narva pottery was influenced and eventually disappeared into the Corded Ware culture. Historiography and research For a long time archaeologists believed that the first inhabitants of the region were Finno-Ugric, who were pushed north by people of the Corded Ware culture. In 1931, Latvian archaeologist was the first to note that artifacts found near the Zebrus Lake in Latvia were different and possibly belonged to a separate archaeological culture. In early 1950s settlements on the Narva River were excavated. and grouped the findings with similar artifacts from eastern Baltic region and described the Narva culture. At first, it was believed that Narva culture ended with the appearance of the Corded Ware culture. However, newer research extended it up to the Bronze Age. As Narva culture spanned several millennia and encompassed a large territory, archaeologists attempted to subdivide the culture into regions or periods. For example, in Lithuania two regions are distinguished: southern (under influence of the Neman culture) and western (with major settlements found in ≈†ventoji). There is an academic debate what ethnicity the Narva culture represented: Finno-Ugrians or other Europids, preceding the arrival of the Indo-Europeans. It is also unclear how the Narva culture fits with the arrival of the Indo-Europeans (Corded Ware and Globular Amphora cultures) and the formation of the Baltic tribes. Genetics A genetic study published in Current Biology in February 2017 examined the remains of male of the Narva culture buried c. 5780-5690 BC. He was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1b1b and the maternal haplogroup U2e1. People of the Narva culture and preceding Kunda culture were determined to have closer genetic affinity with Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHGs) than Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs). In a genetic study published in Current Biology in July 2017, the mtDNA from an Narva male was extracted. He was found to be carrying haplogroup U5a2d. In a genetic study published in Nature Communications in January 2018, the remains of ten individuals ascribed to the Narva culture was analyzed. Of the four samples of Y-DNA extracted, one belonged to I2a1a2a1a, one belonged to I2a1b, one belonged to I, and one belonged to R1. Of the ten samples of mtDNA extracted, eight belonged to U5 haplotypes, one belonged to U4a1, and one belonged to H11. U5 haplotypes were common among Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHGs) and Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHGs). Genetic influence from Eastern Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs) was also detected. A genetic study published in Nature in February 2018 included an analysis of a large number of individuals buried at the Zvejnieki burial ground, most of whom were affiliated with the Kunda culture and the succeeding Narva culture. The mtDNA extracted belonged exclusively to haplotypes of U5, U4 and U2. With regards to Y-DNA, the vast majority of samples belonged to R1b1a1a haplotypes and I2a1 haplotypes. The results affirmed that the Kunda and Narva cultures were about 70% WHG and 30% EHG. The nearby contemporary Pit‚ÄìComb Ware culture was on the contrary found to be about 65% EHG. And individual from the Corded Ware culture, which would eventually succeed the Narva culture, was found to have genetic relations with the Yamnaya culture.

It publishes the Australian Journal of International Affairs. It is one of the oldest active private research institutes in Australia. The institute has branches in seven Australian states and territories and its National Office is located in Deakin, Canberra. The institute's primary mission is to promote \\"interest in and understanding of international affairs, including politics, economics and international law\\". The current National President of the AIIA is Allan Gyngell AO.  History  The origins of the institute can be traced to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that followed the First World War. Participants at that conference believed public opinion was vital in the development of foreign policy. To help create an informed public debate a number of organisations, including the American Council of Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in the United Kingdom, were established to promote an understanding of international affairs. Richard Boyer, an early president of the AIIA, stated that \\"international affairs have ceased to be the sole preserve of foreign offices and specially trained diplomats, and have become not only the concern but the responsibility of the people of the world, and most directly of the people of the democracies\\". The institute was formed in the 1920s as an affiliate of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. It became a federal body in 1933 and was established to provide an \\"objective, scientific study of international affairs. Its purpose is to stimulate interest in and promote understanding of international affairs, including politics, economics and international law\\". The institute adopted the Chatham House Rule to encourage free and frank discussion. In the early decades of its existence, the AIIA received significant research funding from the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR), an American non-governmental organisation that provided a forum for the discussion of political issues facing the countries of the Pacific rim. Some AIIA members were concerned that the IPR was \\"a vehicle for American influence which, in zero-sum terms, was assumed would displace that of Britain\\". Prior to the separation of the Department of External Affairs from the Prime Minister's Department, the institute \\"filled a gap by providing a forum for the discussion of Australia's external interests. Accordingly, the 1930s and 1940s were the period of greatest influence for the AIIA\\". During the 1970s, when Australian foreign policy and the Asia-Pacific region were undergoing considerable change, the institute failed to expand. Gough Whitlam, the Australian Prime Minister at the time, wrote a message to the institute in 1972 that actively encouraged it to help inform public opinion on the rapid changes underway in Australia's neighbourhood.

The Y axis represents intensity measured in decibels and the X axis represents frequency measured in hertz. The threshold of hearing is plotted relative to a standardised curve that represents 'normal' hearing, in dB(HL). They are not the same as equal- loudness contours, which are a set of curves representing equal loudness at different levels, as well as at the threshold of hearing, in absolute terms measured in dB SPL (sound pressure level). Audiograms are set out with frequency in hertz (Hz) on the horizontal axis, most commonly on a logarithmic scale, and a linear dBHL scale on the vertical axis. For humans, normal hearing is between ‚àí10 dB(HL) and 15 dB(HL), although 0 dB from 250 Hz to 8 kHz is deemed to be 'average' normal hearing. Hearing thresholds of humans and other mammals can be found with behavioural hearing tests or physiological tests used in audiometry. For adults, a behavioural hearing test involves a tester who presents tones at specific frequencies (pitches) and intensities (loudnesses). When the testee hears the sound he or she responds (e.g., by raising a hand or pressing a button. The tester records the lowest intensity sound the testee can hear. For children, the tester looks for a response from the testee such as a head turn or using a toy. Children have to learn what to do when they hear the sound, for example they are taught that when they hear the sound they can put a toy man in a boat. This is referred to as conditioned play audiometry. Visual reinforcement audiometry is also used with children. When the child hears the sound, he or she looks in the direction the sound came from and are reinforced with a light and/or animated toy. A similar technique can be used when testing some animals but instead of a toy, food can be used as a reward for responding to the sound. Physiological tests do not need the patient to respond (Katz 2002). For example, when performing the brainstem auditory evoked potentials the patient's brainstem responses are being measured when a sound is played into their ear, or otoacoustic emissions which are generated by a healthy inner ear either spontaneously or evoked by an outside stimulus. In the US, the NIOSH recommends that people who are regularly exposed to hazardous noise have their hearing tested once a year, or every three years otherwise.Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention: Frequently Asked Questions. NIOSH Safety and Health Topic.  Measurement  Audiograms are produced using a piece of test equipment called an audiometer, and this allows different frequencies to be presented to the subject, usually over calibrated headphones, at any specified level. The levels are, however, not absolute, but weighted with frequency relative to a standard graph known as the minimum audibility curve which is intended to represent a 'normal' hearing. This is not the best threshold found for all subjects, under ideal test conditions, which is represented by around 0 Phon or the threshold of hearing on the equal-loudness contours, but is standardised in an ANSI standard to a level somewhat higher at 1 kHz. There are several definitions of the minimal audibility curve, defined in different international standards, and they differ significantly, giving rise to differences in audiograms according to the audiometer used. The ASA-1951 standard for example used a level of 16.5 dB(SPL) at 1 kHz whereas the later ANSI-1969/ISO-1963 standard uses 6.5 dB(SPL), and it is common to allow a 10 dB correction for the older standard. Audiograms and diagnosing types of hearing loss Most commonly, \\"conventional\\" audiometry (utilizing audiograms up to 8 kHz) is used to measure hearing status. For research purposes, or early diagnosis of age- related hearing loss, ultra-high frequency audiograms (up to 20 kHz), requiring special audiometer calibration and headphones, can be measured. Ideally the audiogram would show a straight line, but in practice everyone is slightly different, and small variations are considered normal. Larger variations, especially below the norm, may indicate hearing impairment which occurs to some extent with increasing age, but may be exacerbated by prolonged exposure to fairly high noise levels such as by living close to an airport or busy road, work related exposure to high noise, or brief exposure to very high sound levels such as gunshot or music in either a loud band or clubs and pubs. Hearing impairment may also be the result of certain diseases such as CMV or M√©ni√®re's disease and these can be diagnosed from the shape of the audiogram.

Otosclerosis results in an audiogram with significant loss at all frequencies, often of around 40 dB(HL).pure tone audiometry in otosclerosis from General Practice Notebook.

Created by Yasumi Matsuno and designed by Akihiko Yoshida, he first appeared in Itadaki Street Special and then appeared in Final Fantasy XII as the protagonist. Final Fantasy XII establishes Vaan as an orphaned teenager from Rabanastre who dreams of becoming a sky pirate. He and his best friend Penelo join Dalmasca Princess Ashe in her fight against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire. Vaan also takes a more active role in the sequel Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings and has also been featured in few Final Fantasy crossover games. Vaan was conceptualized as the main character for Final Fantasy XII in order to contrast the older hero from Square's previous title Vagrant Story as a result of negative feedback received by fans. Critical reception to Vaan's character has been mixed as a result of his lack of involvement with the Final Fantasy XIIs plot although various video game publications still found him likable. Appearances Vaan was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game Itadaki Street Special for the PlayStation 2. He also appears in Itadaki Street Portable for the PlayStation Portable. The protagonist of Final Fantasy XII, Vaan is a 17-year-old orphaned street urchin who lost his parents in a plague when he was 12 years old. His only brother, Reks, died two years prior to the start of the game, during the Archadian invasion of Dalmasca. He makes a living as Migelo's assistant, running various errands for him, while at the same time pickpocketing from Archadian soldiers while claiming to take back what is Dalmasca's. He is a cheerful and energetic boy. Vaan dreams of someday becoming a sky pirate in command of his own airship. He trains to meet this goal by killing dire rats in the sewers of Rabanastre on a daily basis, for which Dalan gave him the nickname \\"Vaan Ratsbane.\\" Despite nominally being the protagonist, the majority of the game focuses on the events and conflicts of the world as a whole and of Ashe, rather than Vaan's individual problems, with his character instead used as a narrative device to allow the player to follow the events as an outside observer. During the course of the game, Vaan comes to understand that he has spent his time running from his problems and blaming the Archadian empire for them, rather than moving on with his life after his brother and parents' deaths. Vaan ends the game as a sky pirate, traveling the world along with Penelo. He also reprises his role from Final Fantasy XII in the manga adaptation by Gin Amou. During the events of Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, Vaan becomes captain of the Airship Galbana and uses it to travel to Lemur√©s, meeting old friends while making new ones. By Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift Vaan's and Penelo's adventures take them to the Jylland region of Ivalice, where they get caught up in events surrounding Clan Gully and a boy from another world named Luso Clemens, eventually joining up with the clan for a time. Vaan also appears in the PlayStation Portable fighting game, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, as one of Cosmos' warriors who seek to eliminate creatures known as Maninkins. He returns in the game's sequel, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, as one of Materia's champions. He is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy and its sequel, Curtain Call, as the main character representing Final Fantasy XII. Concept and creation Kouhei Takeda's work as Vaan's voice actor and motion capture affected his characterization Yasumi Matsuno added Vaan and Penelo to be male and female avatar characters for the player in Final Fantasy XII. They would see and learn about Ivalice in sync with the player over the course of the game but would not be deeply connected to the story. The development team explained that their previous game, Vagrant Story, which featured a \\"strong man in his prime\\" as the protagonist had been unsuccessful and unpopular; the change regarding Final Fantasy XII from a \\"big and tough\\" protagonist to a more effeminate one was thus decided after targeting demographics were considered. Although originally conceived as more \\"rugged\\", Vaan was changed during development of the game to be more effeminate after \\"taking into consideration the target demographic\\". He was designed by character designer Akihiko Yoshida to look Asian. In response to criticism from Western fans regarding Vaan's design executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu noted that while several members from the development team were not feeling Vaan was the right main character owing to his young age, it was common for Japanese RPG to start with an inexperienced characters who grow across the game. Motomu Toriyama, the writer and director of Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings, picked Vaan as his favourite character in the game. In the making of the high-definition of Final Fantasy XII, the staff reflected on how \\"weak\\" and unreliable he was in the original game. However, they jokingly discussed together that ten years later, he could become more appealing than Balthier, a character Square found appealing. Wanting characters who could appeal to long-term fans and new fans, the team incorporated Vaan and Penelo in Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift. Vaan's appearance, which was supposed to mirror that of Balthier, was suggested by Hiroaki Kato. In Dissidia, he is featured in his Final Fantasy XII design, while alternative ones depict him as in Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift, a new one by Yoshitaka Amano and another one featuring him as sea pirate by Akihiko Yoshida. Another Final Fantasy XII centered-title, only known as Fortress, was in plans by Square Enix but was cancelled; in this video game, Vaan would remain with Penelo and live quiet lives due to the plot being more focused on other characters from the previous games, most notably Ashe, Larsa and Basch. Vaan was voiced in Final Fantasy XII by Bobby Edner in English and by Kouhei Takeda in Japanese. With the casting of Takeda for the voice acting and motion capture, Vaan became a little less feminine and more \\"active, upbeat bright and positive\\" than planned. In the making of the English version, some lines involving Vaan had to changed for its release but without the loss of the real information. When asked how he compares to other Final Fantasy protagonists, Hideo Minaba stated that due in part to being designed by a different character designer than before, he did not feel he could be compared to any other Final Fantasy character. Vaan's inclusion in Dissidia 012 met difficulties due to the fact Takeda was busy with other works to voice him. However, following a Japanese popularity survey, the staff in charge hired Kensh≈ç Ono to replace Takeda as fans wanted him to appear in Dissidia 012. Reception The similarities between the design of Vaan and Tetsuya Nomura's have been criticized, which artist Akihiko Yoshida noted was likely due to the similar colours used. In the book Final Fantasy and Philosophy: The Ultimate Walkthrough, he is described by Greg Littmann as a pick pocket and, unlike many of Final Fantasys protagonists, lacking in a \\"sense of honesty and justice\\". GameSpot editor Greg Kasavin described Vaan as the \\"token androgynous male lead\\", also describing him as an \\"Aladdin-type\\". G4 TV editor Greg Orlando described him as \\"eminently likable\\" due to the game's focus on \\"political intrigue\\" and Vaan trying to understand it all. Cyril Lachel of GamingNexus.com stated that while he was not a fan of Vaan, he was surprised by how his story turned out. 1UP.com editor Andrew Pfister stated that while everyone was expecting to hate what he describes as an \\"angsty teen\\", this is \\"tempered by the presence of Balthier and Basch\\", two fellow characters. Kotaku's Jason Schreir considered Vaan and Penelo the game's weak points as they compared them with other characters such as Balthier and Asche whose actions were \\"interesting\\". Christian Nutt of GamesRadar made fun of the character in an article about the best Final Fantasy heroes stating that Vaan would definitely not be included. Meanwhile, US Gamer simply described him as a stereotypical character often seen in anime series aimed at young people. Jason Schreier, another Kotaku writer, went harsher, to the point of making a podcast titled \\"Vaan Really Sucks\\" as he and his partner interacted about video games. Edner's English voice acting of Vaan was met with positive response. His lessened involvement with the plot compared to protagonists from preceding Final Fantasy titles was met with mixed reception. Destructoid editor Aaron Linde described him as \\"arguably the most uninspiring character in the game\\". Play.tm editor Andrew Macarthy described Vaan as an \\"undescribing figure\\". Eurogamer editor Rob Fahey stated that while \\"players may initially be somewhat dismayed to find themselves largely following around the cheerful prettyboy Vaan\\", the game introduces new characters who \\"fill out the cast superbly\\". PSX Extreme editor Cavin Smith commented that due to the game not focusing on just one character, Vaan \\"spends the entire game as an observer of the events unfolding in front of him\\", adding that it is a \\"far different take on the protagonist compared to Nomura's egocentric tendencies\\". Daily Collegian was harsher to the point of listing him as one of the most useless characters in the franchise due to his lack of appeal most notably in comparison to the party members from his game. PALGN editor Phil Larsen called him a \\"rogue-ish bad boy with a heart of gold\\", adding that \\"while this may seem clich√©d at first, Vaan is always presented as extremely young and never tries to control every situation\\", citing Tidus as an example of someone who does. Worthplaying editor Agustin described the set-up as being \\"Dragon Quest-like\\", and that while he acts as a vehicle for players to view the plot through, he compared him to critically acclaimed characters Crono and Link from the Chrono Trigger and The Legend of Zelda series respectively. Bobby Edner's portrayal of Vaan has been met with mostly positive reception. Cavin Smith praised his acting, stating that he sounds like an actual teenager without sounding whiny. Agustin praised the developers for giving Vaan a voice actor, commenting that it prevents any awkward silences from a silent protagonist. He added however that Vaan is \\"decidedly quiet\\", owing to many of the conversations not requiring his input, which Agustin called a \\"brilliant interactive storytelling device\\". His design change from Final Fantasy XII to Revenant Wings was criticized by RPGFan editor Patrick Gann, for going from a teenage design to what appears to be the design of a 10-year-old Vaan.

Soviet M38 Mosin‚ÄìNagant carbine. On a firearm or other tools, the pistol grip is a distinctly protruded handle underneath the main mechanism, to be held by the user's hand at a vertical (and thus more ergonomic) angle, similar to the how one would hold a conventional pistol.Vladimir Chichkov, Grip & Gripping / USA Shooting news March/April 2011 In firearms, the pistol grip is located behind the trigger and generally hold by the hand that operates the trigger. Rifles and shotguns without pistol grips are generally referred to as having \\"straight\\" or \\"upland\\" (shotguns only) style stocks. Some firearms, such as some versions of the Thompson submachine gun, have a second frontal pistol grip (or foregrip) on the firearm's fore-end to be used by the support hand for better stability in operation. Pistol grips can also serve multiple functions, such as a magazine housing (in semi-automatic pistols), bipod (in some foregrips) or tool storage device (for spare batteries, gun oil/cleaner, hex keys, etc). In some firearms, like the Finnish Kk 62 light machine gun, the pistol grip is also used as a handle to charge the weapon. Pistol grips are regarded as a defining feature in United States gun law. A foregrip on a pistol is restricted under the National Firearms Act. Pistol grips that protrude below the weapon but are not integrated with the shoulder stock (i.e. as part of a thumbhole stock) are currently regulated in some states and were regulated by the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Tools with pistol-style grips run the range from hand tools such as bar clamps and hand saws, to power tools such as electric drills and pneumatic surgical sternal saws. Often the word \\"gun\\" appears in the name of pistol gripped tools such as the glue gun, caulking gun and nail gun. Spray painters and grinders also often include this feature for added precision control. One of the reasons the pistol-style grips are so common in machinery is because it is possible to ergonomically position the operating controls for with minimal hand movement. For example, on self-loading rifles such as the AR-15 and M16 rifle, the user's grip hand can manipulate the trigger and magazine release with only the index finger, while using the thumb to control the safety or selector switch, all without needing to remove the palm from the grip.

Boston City Hall Plaza picnic area on artificial turf in front of mural in September 2019. Mural itself. Mural marker. John Frederick Collins (July 20, 1919 ‚Äì November 23, 1995) was the Mayor of Boston, Massachusetts from January 4, 1960 to January 1, 1968 whose property tax assessor's office redlined the city and under whose tenure the Boston Housing Authority actively segregated its public housing developments. Collins also opposed the University of Massachusetts Boston locating its campus permanently in Park Square or elsewhere in Downtown Boston, having the Boston Redevelopment Authority propose locating the campus permanently at the former Columbia Point landfill closed in 1963 instead (and where the school would ultimately move to in 1974). His Associated Press obituary noted that the urban renewal policies Collins implemented in Boston were emulated across the United States. In 2004, nine years after his death, the city government commissioned a mural of Collins on the exterior of Boston City Hall adjacent to Government Center station and dedicated City Hall Plaza to him as well. Early life John Collins was born in Roxbury on July 20, 1919 to an Irish Catholic family.O'Connor, T.H. (1997). Boston Irish: A Political History. New York: Back Bay Books. His father, Frederick \\"Skeets\\" Collins, worked as a mechanic for the Boston Elevated Railway. Collins graduated from Roxbury Memorial High School, and in 1941, from Suffolk University Law School. He served a tour in the Army Counterintelligence Corps during World War II, rising in rank from private to captain. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus. In 1946, Collins married Mary Patricia Cunniff, a legal secretary, who Collins had met through his work as an attorney. She would later campaign for Collins when he was incapacitated by polio. The couple had four children. Early political career In 1947, Collins was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, representing Jamaica Plain, and, in 1950, to the Massachusetts State Senate. Collins spent two terms as senator and then ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in 1954, losing to George Fingold. While campaigning for a seat on the City Council in 1955, Collins and his children contracted polio. Collins' children recovered and he continued with his campaign despite warnings from his doctors. As a result of the disease, Collins was forced to use a wheelchair or crutches for the rest of his life. He was elected to the Council and the following year was appointed Register of Probate for Suffolk County. Mayor of Boston In 1959, he ran against Massachusetts Senate President John E. Powers for Mayor of Boston. Collins was widely viewed as the underdog in the race. Collins ran on the slogan \\"stop power politics\\", and was widely seen as independent of any political machine. Collins' victory in the 1959 mayoral election was considered the biggest upset in city politics in decades. Boston University political scientist Murray Levin wrote a book on the race, titled The Alienated Voter: Politics in Boston, which attributed Collins' victory to the voters' cynicism and resentment of the city's political elite. Collins inherited a city in fiscal distress. Property taxes in Boston were twice as high as in New York or Chicago, even as the city's tax base was declining. Collins established a close relationship with a group of local business leaders known as the Vault, cut taxes in five of his eight years in office and imposed budget cuts on city government. Collins' administration focused on downtown redevelopment: Collins brought the urban planner Edward J. Logue (who had been serving as the administrator of the New Haven Redevelopment Agency) to Boston to lead the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Collins' administration supervised the construction of the Prudential Center complex and of Government Center. However, in March 1965, an investigative study of property tax assessment practices published by the National Tax Association of 13,769 properties sold within the City of Boston from January 1, 1960 to March 31, 1964 found that the assessed values in the neighborhood of Roxbury in 1962 were at 68 percent of market values while the assessed values in West Roxbury were at 41 percent of market values, and the researchers could not find a nonracial explanation for the difference. Also under Collins' tenure as Mayor, the Boston Housing Authority segregated the public housing developments in the city as well, moving black families into the development at Columbia Point while reserving developments in South Boston for white families who started refusing assignment to the Columbia Point project by the early 1960s. In 1962, upon receipt of a lawsuit filed by a civil rights group, the West Broadway Housing Development was desegregated after having been designated by the city for white-only occupancy since 1941. In the same year, the Mission Hill project had 1,024 families (all white), while the Mission Hill Extension project across the street had 580 families (of which 500 were black), and in 1967, when the city government agreed to desegregate the developments, the projects were still 97 percent white and 98 percent black respectively. In August 1965, Collins publicly requested that University of Massachusetts Boston Chancellor John W. Ryan not consider a permanent campus at its current site in Park Square or elsewhere in Downtown Boston but a suburban campus or one located in an underdeveloped section of Roxbury, while University of Massachusetts President John W. Lederle insisted on a campus inside the city limits of Boston. In May 1966, following organized opposition from residents, Collins spoke with Chancellor Ryan and a proposal to locate the UMass Boston campus near Highland Park was cancelled. In 1967, the Boston Redevelopment Authority proposed locating the campus permanently at the former Columbia Point landfill closed in 1963. In response, in November 1967, 1,500 faculty and students organized a rally on Boston Common demanding a location in Copley Square, and before his resignation as UMass Boston Chancellor in February 1968, Ryan proposed a 15-acre campus over the Massachusetts Turnpike and south of where the proposed John Hancock Tower was to be built which the Boston Redevelopment Authority rejected. On February 28, 1963, Collins met with President John F. Kennedy at the White House. Kennedy had supported John Powers during the 1959 mayoral election. Collins won re-election in 1963, easily defeating City Councilor Gabriel Piemonte. However, Collins' budget priorities led to a decrease in city services, particularly in residential neighborhoods outside of downtown. As a result, Collins became unpopular among city residents. In 1966, Collins ran for the United States Senate seat being vacated by the retiring former Senate Republican Conference Whip Leverett Saltonstall, but lost in the primary to former Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody (who in turn would lose to Massachusetts Attorney General Edward Brooke). Despite receiving 42 percent of the vote statewide, Collins lost 21 out of Boston's 22 wards. Weakened politically, Collins declined to seek reelection in 1967 and was succeeded by Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Kevin White. Retirement and legacy After leaving office in 1968, Collins held visiting and consulting professorships at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 13 years. In the early 1970s, Collins drifted away from the Democratic Party. He chaired the group Massachusetts Democrats and Independents for Nixon and, in 1972, attacked Democrats for \\"their crazy policies of social engineering and abortion.\\" Collins was considered for the position of Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon administration. In December 1968, the UMass Boston board of trustees voted 12 to 4 to accept the Columbia Point campus proposal from the Boston Redevelopment Authority. In April 1969, the Students for a Democratic Society rallied more than a hundred students protesting the decision to move the university campus to Columbia Point, denouncing the institution as \\"a 'pawn' masking the Boston Redevelopment Authority's plan to remove poor people from Columbia Point\\" and that \\"the university is planning a prestigious dormitory school with high tuition which students from low- and moderate-income families‚Äìwhom the university was designed to serve‚Äìwill not be able to attend.\\" In January 1974, the university moved to the current Columbia Point campus. In 1977, the Massachusetts General Court formed a special legislative committee led by Amherst College President John William Ward that found that the Columbia Point campus was negligently constructed (in addition to extortion payments made to Massachusetts State Senators Joseph DiCarlo and Ronald MacKenzie by McKee-Berger-Mansueto, the company contracted to supervise the construction of the campus). In July 2006, UMass Boston Chancellor Michael F. Collins ordered the immediate and permanent closure of the parking garage underneath the main campus, causing a loss of 1,500 parking spaces and requiring the university to begin developing a 25-year plan to renew the campus the following October, which was ultimately proposed by Chancellor J. Keith Motley and approved by the UMass Boston board of trustees in December 2007. In April 2017, Chancellor Motley resigned amidst a $30 million structural operating budget deficit caused by the construction costs of the renewal plan, which required the university to begin cutting courses required for graduation during the upcoming summer and fall semesters as well as other academic spending. In 1963, when UMass System President John W. Lederle endorsed expanding the system to Boston before the state legislature, there were 12,000 freshman applications to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst with only 2,600 slots, yet the majority of the applicants lived in the Greater Boston area. In the late 1960s, UMass Boston reportedly had the largest population of Vietnam War veterans than any university in the United States (many of whom had been recently discharged), and the largest population of African American students of all universities in Massachusetts. As of April 2018, the UMass Boston campus remained the sole majority-minority campus in the UMass system, and during the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year, UMass Boston served 650 military veterans, managed $4 million in federal G.I. benefits, and was ranked by multiple publications as being among the best universities in the United States for veteran students. Death and burial Collins died of pneumonia in Boston, on November 23, 1995. Five days later, he was buried at St. Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury following a funeral Mass at Boston's Holy Cross Cathedral celebrated by Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, Archbishop of Boston (1984‚Äì2002).http://www.nndb.com/people/751/000163262/ Obituaries of him published in MIT Tech Talk and by the Associated Press in The New York Times did not mention that the Boston Housing Authority actively segregated the public housing developments in the city during his tenure, nor the redlining practices of his property tax assessor's office, but the latter noted that the urban renewal policies Collins implemented in Boston were emulated across the United States. In 2004, the same year Illinois State Senator Barack Obama gave the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, the city government commissioned a mural of Collins on the exterior of Boston City Hall adjacent to Government Center station and dedicated City Hall Plaza to him as well. The caption engraved in the mural's marker does not mention the segregationist and redlining policies of the Collins mayoral administration either.

Powers and abilities Ghaur is the result of crossbreeding of his forebearers supervised by Deviant priests trained in genetics over centuries. His superhuman powers include the psionic ability to manipulate the minds and actions of any other Deviant whose genetic code is known to him. Since he also has a photographic memory, that effectively means every Deviant in existence, with the sole exception of the Warlord Kro and Ransak the Reject. Ghaur has a gifted intellect, and is a master politician and cunning strategist. Deviant scientists have supplied him with \\"Brain Mines\\", which can render even an Eternal unconscious, bracelets containing cybernetic circuitry which paralyze the wearer's will (turning the wearer into a slave), and various Deviant vehicles. Ghaur briefly possessed the body and attributes of a Celestial, but lost most of those powers upon returning to his original form. He retained a degree of superhuman strength and durability, the ability to survive without oxygen, and low level energy manipulation powers for a short time but then lost these superhuman powers entirely.

After Sierra Leone became independent, he served as Military Attach√© to the United States. Lansana was one of the most distinguished officers in the history of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces. He was one of the first Sierra Leoneans to train at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Berkshire, United Kingdom. Through his marriage to Komeh Gulama Lansana, the daughter of Paramount Chief Julius Gulama of Kaiyamba Chiefdom he was a relative of Paramount Chief Ella Koblo Gulama and her husband Paramount Chief Bai Koblo Pathbana II, two of the nation's most influential politicians. On 21 March 1967, Lansana staged the first coup d'√©tat in the history of the independent state of Sierra Leone. Lansana was charged with treason, tried and found guilty. He was executed on 19 July 1975. Early life and education Lansana was born on 22 March 1922 in Baiima, Mandu Chiefdom, Kailahun District, British Sierra Leone. He was a Mende. In 1947, he enlisted as a private and began his training in the Sierra Leone Army. Lansana was the bearer of Sierra Leone's colours during the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. =Royal Military Academy Sandhurst= Lansana was one of a small, elite group of Sierra Leoneans to be educated at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Berkshire, United Kingdom during the colonial period. As a Lieutenant, he was a frequent and popular visitor to the home of Sir Robert de Zouche Hall, Governor of Sierra Leone from 1952 to 1956. Marriage and family He was married to Komeh Gulama Lansana, the daughter of Paramount Chief Julius Gulama of Kaiyamba Chiefdom and Madame Lucy Gulama.Tribute to the Honourable PC Ella Koblo Gulama The Gulamas are Mende royalty and among the most important ruling families in Sierra Leone. His father-in-law was a founding member of the Sierra Leone People's Party, the first and oldest political party in the country. His sister-in-law was Paramount Chief Ella Koblo Gulama. His brother- in-law was Paramount Chief Bai Koblo Pathbana II. Lansana and his wife had five children Sheku, Judy, Tala, Foday, Kornya. Lansana also had a son, Daniel, from another relationship. =Force Commander of the Sierra Leone Military= He was appointed army commander of Sierra Leone in 1964.Political leadership in Sierra Leone by John R. Cartwright page 80. When his close friend and ally Prime Minister Albert Margai came to power, Brigadier Lansana took control of the army from British colonial adviser, Brigadier R.D. Blackie. Margai promoted a one party (non-democratic) state. Both Lansana and Margai came from the Mende tribe which exacerbated existing conflicts with the northern tribes and the Krios. Northern and Krio officers were systematically purged from the armed forces. Sierra Leone's first coup d'√©tatThe 1967 General Election= On 17 March 1967, Margai was defeated in the general election. The All People's Congress (APC) won 32 seats in parliament while Margai's SLPP held on to just 28 seats. =Martial Law= Sierra Leone was the first country in postcolonnial Africa to hold a successful democratic election. This distinction lasted only four days. On 21 March 1967, Lansana instructed Samuel Hinga Norman conduct the extrajudicial arrest of the new, democratically elected prime minister Siaka Stevens. The arrest took place prior to the announcement of the election result. Lansana then seized control of Government House as well as the national radio and television channels and declared martial law in Sierra Leone. On 22 March 1967, Lansana made a second radio broadcast reiterating his declaration of martial law. =Counter coup= Lansana's unilateral decision was unpopular with many of his fellow Mende officers who did not believe the army should be a tool of internal government.Political leadership in Sierra Leone by John R. Cartwright pages 80-81. In addition to this, before to the coup d'√©tat his influence with his subordinates had been compromised by accusations of \\"drunkenness\\" and \\"womanizing\\". On 23 March 1967, Major Charles Blake and other senior military officers relieved Lansana of his command. They established the National Reformation Council (NRC) and took control of the government. Subsequently, Lt.-Colonel Andrew Juxon-Smith, of the Krio community, who was abroad when the coup took place, was asked to return and head the NRC military regime in 1968. =Arrest= Both Lansana and his sister-in-law Paramount Chief Ella Koblo Gulama were arrested on charges of treason and detained at Padema Road Prison. Both were charged of conspiracy with former Prime Minister Albert Margai. The claim was based on a meeting between Gulama and Margai on 19 March 1967 in which Margai is said to have express his wish not to lose his office. He was said to be weighing his options, including military intervention. Gulama was a minister without portfolio in Margai's government. She was also the hereditary ruler of Kaiyamba District, the most powerful Mende chiefdom in Sierra Leone. She reportedly advised him not to stand down from the office of Prime Minister in spite of the APC victory. She was also reported to have offered him her formidable support and suggested that both Margai bribe Lansana to stage a coup d'√©tat. The charges against Gulama could not be proven and she was released from prison after one and a half year. =Incarceration and execution= Lansana was detained at Pademba Road Prison, Freetown, Sierra Leone. On 19 July 1975, Lansana was executed by hanging with former Minister of Finance Mohamed Forna, Lieutenant Habib Lansana Kamara, Ibrahim Bash Taqi, and Paramount Chief Bai Makarie N‚Äôsilk were executed at Pademba Road Prison. After their executions, their bodies were displayed for an hour.

A related concept is the drift rate, which is the rate at which the average changes. For example, a process that counts the number of heads in a series of n fair coin tosses has a drift rate of 1/2 per toss. This is in contrast to the random fluctuations about this average value. The stochastic mean of that coin-toss process is 1/2 and the drift rate of the stochastic mean is 0, assuming 1 = heads and 0 = tails. Stochastic drifts in population studies Longitudinal studies of secular events are frequently conceptualized as consisting of a trend component fitted by a polynomial, a cyclical component often fitted by an analysis based on autocorrelations or on a Fourier series, and a random component (stochastic drift) to be removed. In the course of the time series analysis, identification of cyclical and stochastic drift components is often attempted by alternating autocorrelation analysis and differencing of the trend. Autocorrelation analysis helps to identify the correct phase of the fitted model while the successive differencing transforms the stochastic drift component into white noise. Stochastic drift can also occur in population genetics where it is known as genetic drift. A finite population of randomly reproducing organisms would experience changes from generation to generation in the frequencies of the different genotypes. This may lead to the fixation of one of the genotypes, and even the emergence of a new species. In sufficiently small populations, drift can also neutralize the effect of deterministic natural selection on the population. Stochastic drift in economics and finance Time series variables in economics and finance ‚Äî for example, stock prices, gross domestic product, etc. ‚Äî generally evolve stochastically and frequently are non- stationary. They are typically modelled as either trend-stationary or difference stationary. A trend stationary process {yt} evolves according to :y_t = f(t) + e_t where t is time, f is a deterministic function, and et is a zero-long-run-mean stationary random variable. In this case the stochastic term is stationary and hence there is no stochastic drift, though the time series itself may drift with no fixed long-run mean due to the deterministic component f(t) not having a fixed long-run mean. This non-stochastic drift can be removed from the data by regressing y_t on t using a functional form coinciding with that of f, and retaining the stationary residuals. In contrast, a unit root (difference stationary) process evolves according to :y_t = y_{t-1} + c + u_t where u_t is a zero-long-run-mean stationary random variable; here c is a non-stochastic drift parameter: even in the absence of the random shocks ut, the mean of y would change by c per period. In this case the non-stationarity can be removed from the data by first differencing, and the differenced variable z_t = y_t - y_{t-1} will have a long-run mean of c and hence no drift. But even in the absence of the parameter c (that is, even if c=0), this unit root process exhibits drift, and specifically stochastic drift, due to the presence of the stationary random shocks ut: a once- occurring non-zero value of u is incorporated into the same period's y, which one period later becomes the one-period-lagged value of y and hence affects the new period's y value, which itself in the next period becomes the lagged y and affects the next y value, and so forth forever. So after the initial shock hits y, its value is incorporated forever into the mean of y, so we have stochastic drift. Again this drift can be removed by first differencing y to obtain z which does not drift. In the context of monetary policy, one policy question is whether a central bank should attempt to achieve a fixed growth rate of the price level from its current level in each time period, or whether to target a return of the price level to a predetermined growth path. In the latter case no price level drift is allowed away from the predetermined path, while in the former case any stochastic change to the price level permanently affects the expected values of the price level at each time along its future path. In either case the price level has drift in the sense of a rising expected value, but the cases differ according to the type of non- stationarity: difference stationarity in the former case, but trend stationarity in the latter case.

History On October 31, 1862, Congress authorized the construction of Fort Sumner. General James Henry Carleton initially justified the fort as offering protection to settlers in the Pecos River valley from the Mescalero Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche. He also created the Bosque Redondo reservation, a \\"Fort Sumner Historic Site/Bosque Redondo Memorial\\", New Mexico Historic Sites website area where over 9,000 Navajo and Mescalero Apaches were forced to live because of accusations that they were raiding white settlements near their respective homelands. The fort was named for General Edwin Vose Sumner.https://www.newmexico.org/fort-sumner/, New Mexico website The reservation was to be self-sufficient, while teaching Mescalero Apache and Navajo how to be modern farmers. General Edward Canby, whom Carleton replaced, had first suggested that the Navajo people be moved to a series of reservations and be taught new skills. Some in Washington, D.C. thought that the Navajo should not be moved and that a reservation should be created on their own land. Some New Mexico citizens encouraged killing the Navajo or at least removing them from their lands. The 1865 and 1866 corn crop was sufficient, but in 1867 it was a total failure. Army officers and Indian Agents realized that Bosque Redondo was a failure, as it had poor water and too little firewood for the numbers of people who were living there. The Mescalero soon ran away; the Navajo stayed longer, but in May 1868 were permitted to return to their native lands. When the Bosque Redondo was established, Gen. Carleton ordered Col. Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson to do whatever necessary to bring first the Mescalero and then the Navajo there. All of the Mescalero Apache had been relocated by the end of 1862, but the Navajo were not resettled in large numbers until early 1864. The Navajo refer to the journey from Navajo land to the Bosque Redondo as the Long Walk. More than 300 Navajos died making the journey.Brown, Dee. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West. Thirtieth Anniversary Edition. Henry Holt and Company, 2000. pp. 28-29. It was a bitter memory to many Navajo. One man described it as follows: \\"By slow stages we traveled eastward by present Gallup and Shushbito, Bear spring, which is now called Fort Wingate. You ask how they treated us? If there was room the soldiers put the women and children on the wagons. Some even let them ride behind them on their horses. I have never been able to understand a people who killed you one day and on the next played with your children...?\\"Very Slim Man, Navajo elder, quoted by Richard Van Valkenburgh, Desert Magazine, April, 1946, p. 23. U.S. troops at Fort Sumner. In April 1865 there were about 8,500 Navajo and 500 Mescalero Apache interned at Bosque Redondo. The Army had planned only 5,000 would be there, so lack of sufficient food was an issue from the start. As the Navajo and Mescalero Apache had long been enemies, their enforced proximity led to frequent open fighting. The environmental situation got worse. The interned people had no clean water; it was full of alkali and there was no firewood to cook with. The water from the nearby Pecos River caused severe intestinal problems, and disease quickly spread throughout the camp. Food was in short supply because of crop failures, Army and Indian Agent bungling, and criminal activities. In 1865, the Mescalero Apache, or those strong enough to travel, managed to escape. The Navajo were not allowed to leave until May 1868 when the U.S. Army agreed that Fort Sumner and the Bosque Redondo reservation was a failure. The 1868 Treaty of Bosque Redondo was negotiated with the Navajo and they were allowed to return to their homeland, to a \\"new reservation\\". They were joined by the thousands of Navajo who had been hiding out in the Arizona Territory hinterlands. This experience resulted in a more determined Navajo, and never again were they surprised by raiders of the Rio Grande valley.Indian Depredations in New Mexico, John S. Watts, Wash. D.C., 1858, 66 pages. In subsequent years, they have expanded the \\"new reservation\\" into well over 16 million acres (65,000 km¬≤). Fort Sumner was abandoned in 1869 and purchased by rancher and cattle baron Lucien Maxwell. Maxwell rebuilt one of the officers' quarters into a 20-room house. On July 14, 1881, Sheriff Pat Garrett shot and killed Billy the Kid in this house, now referred to as the Maxwell House.  Fort Sumner Historic Site  In 1968‚Äîone hundred years after the signing of the treaty that allowed the Navajo people to return to their original homes in the Four Corners Region‚ÄîFort Sumner was declared a New Mexico State Monument. The property is now managed by the New Mexico Historic Sites (formerly State Monuments) division of the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs. On June 4, 2005, a new museum designed by Navajo architect David N. Sloan was opened on the site as the Bosque Redondo Memorial. Congress had authorized the establishment of the memorial by the Secretary of Defense in 2000, making federal funds available for construction. The Bosque Redondo Memorial and Fort Sumner Historic Site are located southeast of Fort Sumner, New Mexico: east on U.S. Route 60/U.S. Route 84, then south on Billy The Kid Road.

It replaced the Kings of Wrestling as the dominant heel faction in TNA in February 2005, and remained prominent until totally disbanding upon the commencement of Jarrett's leave of absence from TNA television in October 2006. The stable was also known as (Jeff) Jarrett's Army. HistoryKevin Nash and Diamond Dallas Page= NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett was left alone following the dissolution of the Kings of Wrestling in early 2005, with Scott Hall sidelined due to personal problems and Kevin Nash newly turned face and pursuing Jarrett's title. At Against All Odds on February 13, Jarrett defended his title against Nash. In the course of the match, Billy Gunn (who was released by World Wrestling Entertainment in November 2004) entered the ring and gave Nash a chair shot, thus shifting the momentum of the match towards Jarrett and enabling him to defeat Nash and retain his title. Jarrett was accompanied by Gunn (identified as \\"The Outlaw\\") on the February 18 episode of TNA Impact!, when TNA Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes forced Jarrett to defend his title against Diamond Dallas Page at Destination X. Over the following weeks, Jarrett assembled a force to counter Page's allies, recruiting Larry Zbyszko, his lawyer Mr. Daggett, Tim Welch, Chris Candido and The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas). The build-up of forces on each side culminated in a \\"Ringside Revenge match\\" on March 13 at Destination X, with Jarrett's allies and Page's allies both surrounding the ring during the title match. After Daggett entered the ring towards the end of the match, \\"The Alpha Male\\" Monty Brown entered the ring, apparently in order to stop Daggett from interfering in the match. Brown, at that point arguably the most over face in TNA, turned on Page, however, and sided with Jarrett, hitting Page with his signature \\"Pounce\\" maneuver and enabling Jarrett to retain his title once more. Jarrett held a celebratory party on the March 18 episode of Impact!, which was attended by Daggett, Brown, Candido and The Naturals. Later that night, Jarrett explained that Brown had been frustrated at not receiving a title shot, and so had aligned himself with Jarrett. Brown then announced that he, Jarrett and The Outlaw were going to \\"take over\\" TNA. On the March 25 episode of Impact!, Dusty Rhodes announced that, at Lockdown, Jarrett, Brown and The Outlaw would face Nash, Page and Nash's friend Sean Waltman in a \\"Lethal Lockdown match\\": a six man tag match held inside a steel cage, with two wrestlers starting in the ring and another (randomly determined) wrestler entering the ring every two minutes. Moreover, the usage of weapons throughout the match would be perfectly legal. Over the next several weeks, Planet Jarrett had several confrontations with Nash and his allies. Nash overpowered Candido and The Naturals on the April 8 episode of Impact!, leaving Candido using a wheelchair with a cast on his leg. The following week, Daggett informed Nash that he would be thrown out of the arena by security if he approached Candido or any other member of Planet Jarrett. This led to Nash being evicted from the building, allowing Brown and The Outlaw to defeat Page and Waltman in a tag match (with the assistance of Jarrett, who broke a guitar over Waltman's head). Nash was unable to wrestle at Lockdown on April 24 due to a staph infection, and was replaced by B.G. James. Jarrett and Waltman began in the cage, with The Outlaw entering after five minutes. Waltman was thus outnumbered for two minutes, until Page entered the ring, wielding a kendo stick. However, Brown entered the ring two minutes later, once again giving Planet Jarrett a numerical advantage. James was the last entrant, and his presence enabled Waltman and Page to fight back and defeat Planet Jarrett. Following Lockdown, Planet Jarrett began to dwindle in number. Daggett and Zbyszko disappeared without explanation, while Candido unexpectedly died as a result of a blood clot following complications that arose during a surgery to correct an ankle injury he sustained during Lockdown. As a result of Candido's death, The Naturals became de facto faces, as the sudden loss of their manager generated a degree of sympathy for the young tag team. The Outlaw remained in Planet Jarrett, but was distracted by his rivalry with the 3Live Kru. =A.J. Styles and Raven= At Hard Justice on May 15, Jarrett defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against perennial challenger and long-term enemy A.J. Styles, while Brown and The Outlaw faced Diamond Dallas Page and 3Live Kru member Ron \\"The Truth\\" Killings. Brown pinned Page to win the tag match, but Jarrett lost his title to Styles following botched interference from Brown (who accidentally \\"Pounced\\" Jarrett) and a knockout punch from guest referee Tito Ortiz, who responded forcefully when a frustrated Jarrett pushed him during the match. After three months, Planet Jarrett had lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 20 episode of Impact!, Jarrett complained to Styles that Ortiz had been a biased referee. Jarrett and Brown then attacked Styles until Abyss entered the ring. The perpetually mute Abyss initially looked as though he would attack Jarrett and Brown, but instead delivered his signature \\"Black Hole Slam\\" maneuver to the already hurt Styles, much to the delight of Jarrett and Brown. After Abyss defeated Chris Sabin in the main event of the evening, Jarrett entered the ring to celebrate with his supposed teammate. However, Abyss promptly delivered the Black Hole Slam to Jarrett, indicating that he was not part of Planet Jarrett. The following weeks, Styles and Waltman defeated Jarrett and Brown in a tag match when Jarrett accidentally hit Brown with a guitar. The announcement by Dusty Rhodes that at Slammiversary Styles would defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match which included both Jarrett and Brown appeared to further exacerbate the cracks developing in the unity of Planet Jarrett. At Slammiversary on June 19, Styles defended his title in a King of the Mountain match which included Raven, Abyss, Brown and Waltman. Jarrett was scheduled to be in the main event, but was removed from the main event and replaced with Raven after he assaulted a \\"fan\\" who was heckling him. Raven went on to win the match, climbing the ladder after subduing Brown with a Raven Effect DDT. Abyss, who was close to winning at Slammiversary before he was knocked off the ladder by Raven, was awarded a title shot at No Surrender, much to the chagrin of Jarrett. Jarrett was furious at having been \\"overlooked\\", and began taking out his frustrations on the TNA roster, hitting Zach Gowen with a guitar on the July 8 episode of Impact!. While Jarrett was preoccupied with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Brown was drawn into the ongoing feud between The Outlaw (who had by now renamed himself \\"Kip James\\") and the 3Live Kru. =Rhino= At the outset of No Surrender on July 17, an increasingly paranoid Jarrett, by now convinced that he would be imminently fired and replaced, questioned play-by-play commentator Mike Tenay, asking him when the sixteen wrestlers fired from WWE that month would arrive in TNA. Tenay informed Jarrett that Rhino was scheduled to debut in TNA that night. Throughout No Surrender, Jarrett approached other wrestlers backstage and warned them that their jobs might also be in peril, thus gaining the support of Team Canada. Jarrett also instructed Larry Zbyszko (by now the TNA Director of Authority, having replaced Dusty Rhodes) to warn Rhino that Jarrett was waiting for him. Following the main event, in which Raven defeated Abyss to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Jarrett entered the ring and threatened to give Raven a \\"reality check\\". At that point, Rhino entered the ring and \\"Gored!\\" Raven before celebrating with Jarrett. Rhino was the newest member of Planet Jarrett. After Jarrett and Rhino attacked the outnumbered Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, Sabu made his return to TNA on July 29, helping Raven fight off Jarrett and Rhino. This led to a tag match between Raven and Sabu and Planet Jarrett (Jarrett and Rhino) at Sacrifice on August 14. At the beginning of Sacrifice, Jarrett asked Zbyszko for a title shot. Zbyszko agreed that Jarrett would receive a title shot if he pinned Raven, but warned him that, should he be pinned by Raven, he would be banned from receiving a title shot for a year. Later that night, Jarrett tried to convince The Naturals to rejoin Planet Jarrett, but they refused. In the main event of Sacrifice, the suspended Jeff Hardy returned to TNA by attacking Jarrett and hitting him with a swanton bomb. When Raven tried to take advantage and put the Raven Effect DDT on Jarrett, Rhino Gored! Raven and pinned him. An irate Jarrett then learned that Rhino would be the one who received a title shot at Unbreakable on September 11. On the August 19 episode of Impact!, Jarrett demanded that Rhino give him his title shot, but Rhino refused, instead offering Jarrett a title shot if he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Raven. Later in the program, Monty Brown mocked Kip James's unsuccessful attempts to recruit B.G. James into Planet Jarrett. On August 26, The Alpha Male exhorted James to follow his leadership and \\"hunt together\\". Jarrett then warned Brown that Planet Jarrett were in fact \\"the hunted\\". While James affirmed his loyalty to Jarrett, Brown left Planet Jarrett by claiming that he had never trusted Jarrett, and that the agreement they had made was broken. At Unbreakable, Brown and Jarrett both demanded a title shot at Bound for Glory from Zbyszko, with Kip James (unsuccessfully) attempting to defuse the situation and persuade Brown to apologize to Jarrett. That same night, Jarrett's attempt to help Rhino defeat Raven was foiled by Jeff Hardy. =The \\"Controversy in Canada\\"= Having suffered several defeats, Jarrett devised a new way to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. At an untelevised Border City Wrestling show with several TNA wrestlers in attendance, Jarrett defeated Raven for the title following the unanticipated interference of America's Most Wanted, thus becoming a four-time champion. TNA Championship Committee Member Larry Zbyszko, who was in attendance at the time, declared the title change official. Events on the October 1 episode of Impact! saw the beginnings of a feud between America's Most Wanted and the debuting Team 3D, while the returning Kevin Nash challenged Jarrett to a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound For Glory. The following week, the debuting Gail Kim interfered on the behalf of America's Most Wanted during their scheduled tag team match with Team 3D, apparently joining Planet Jarrett. On October 15, a vignette aired on Impact! showing a \\"funeral\\" delivered for the careers of Team 3D. Father James Mitchell presided, with America's Most Wanted delivering a eulogy. Jarrett, Kim, Team Canada and Abyss were also in attendance, and the guest book was signed with the names of several key WWE officials (\\"Vince and Linda\\", \\"Paul and Stephanie\\", \\"Paul H.\\" and \\"Pat and Sylvan\\", the last of which was an inside reference to rumors surrounding the circumstances in which \\"Sylvan\\" was hired by \\"Pat\\"). At the end of the funeral, Planet Jarrett claimed that they would return to the funeral parlour the day after Bound For Glory to bury the career of Kevin Nash as well. Planet Jarrett were, however, denied the opportunity to \\"bury\\" Nash at Bound For Glory after he was withdrawn from the event due to the onset of an illness during the afternoon before the pay-per-view. Jarrett brought a casket to the event regardless, claiming that he would \\"bury\\" someone that night. In light of the circumstances, Championship Committee Member Larry Zbyszko announced that Jarrett would defend his title against the winner of a ten man over-the- top rope gauntlet match. The winner of the gauntlet match was Rhino, who went on to defeat Jarrett despite heavy interference, presumably leaving Planet Jarrett in the process. Following the match, Jarrett, America's Most Wanted and Team Canada attacked Rhino and threw him into the casket. However, Rhino was saved by the 3Live Kru - now being openly assisted by Kip James - and the returning Team 3D. The event ended with Team Canada member Eric Young trapped in the coffin, while Rhino celebrated with the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On a special two-hour episode of Impact! on November 3, Jarrett defeated Rhino to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, once again with the assistance of America's Most Wanted (who, earlier that night, had attacked and handcuffed Team 3D to prevent them from foiling their interference). =Christian Cage and Sting= Jarrett and America's Most Wanted lost to Rhino and Team 3D in a six-man tag team match at Genesis on November 13. That same night, the debuting Christian Cage opted not to join Team Canada, instead assaulting Scott D'Amore before helping Team 3D drive Jarrett through a table. On the November 26, 2005 episode of Impact!, Jackie Gayda debuted in TNA, immediately confronting Jarrett. She later claimed to have information on the \\"Controversy in Canada\\", and began attempting to blackmail Jarrett using the (undisclosed) information. With the assistance of Team Canada, Jarrett successfully defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Rhino at Turning Point on December 11. Immediately following the match, the arena lights dimmed and images of scorpions appeared on the arena screens. When the lighting returned, the baseball bat, boots and trench coat of Sting were draped on a chair in the center of the ring. The debut of Cage and scheduled return of Sting at Final Resolution appeared to frighten Jarrett. On the December 17 episode of Impact!, Jarrett appealed to Monty Brown, claiming that their positions in TNA were being endangered by the incoming wrestlers. Brown agreed with Jarrett, apparently reforging their alliance. At Final Resolution, Jarrett and Brown were defeated by Cage and Sting, with Sting pinning Jarrett following a Scorpion Deathdrop. On the following episode of Impact!, Sting announced his retirement (although Team Canada member Eric Young would later claim that Sting had not left). At Against All Odds on February 12, Christian Cage defeated Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The guest referee for the match was former WWE official Earl Hebner. Shortly before Against All Odds, Jarrett recruited Alex Shelley to obtain footage of Jackie Gayda and Sting using his \\"Shelley-cam\\". Shelley later presented Jarrett with (unseen) footage of Gayda, informing Jarrett that \\"she's a kinky dame!\\" Jarrett used the film to blackmail Gayda, forcing her to join his stable. At Destination X on March 12, Christian Cage successfully retained the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match with Monty Brown. Following the match, Jarrett demanded a rematch against Cage, but he refused. Jarrett and Abyss then attacked Cage, with Monty Brown assisting them. After Rhino attempted to save Cage, Team Canada and the remainder of Planet Jarrett also entered the ring, leaving Cage and Rhino outnumbered. Cage and Rhino were assaulted until Sting made his return, clearing the ring with a baseball bat and locking Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock. He maintained the hold until the debuting Scott Steiner knocked him down and placed him in the Steiner Recliner, joining Planet Jarrett. In response, Sting recruited Samoa Joe to team with him in a tag match against Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner at Sacrifice, where Joe scored the pin on Jarrett to win. The following month, Jarrett emerged as the only member of the faction present in the main event King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. Jarrett won the match, utilizing help from referee Earl Hebner and official Larry Zbyszko. Jarrett would retain the title against Sting at Hard Justice thanks to interference from Christian Cage before losing it to Sting in a Title vs Career match at Bound for Glory.

The maximum new publication is \\"Dark Loaders-The Devil's works-(3)\\" of July 25, 2005 sale.  World of \\"Mandora\\" and \\"Darklo\\"  *\\"Mansions (meaning of Apartments) & Dragons\\", \\"Dark Loaders -The Devil's works-\\", \\"Sarara's Little Shop\\"... these are the comics in which the view of the world of a table talk RPG has appeared strongly. *These three manga have a view of the world and a fundamentally common setup. Although the world of \\"kotonoha (meaning of \\"the leaf of language\\")\\" is made into the stage and it is based on a setup called that the race of orthodox Hero and an evil spirit fights, not only the depiction that made the Hero= justice side the subject but the deployment from a viewpoint by the side of the dangerous race = villain is prepared.Not extremely serious deployment but the work with which it came out dimly and agreeable deployment maintained exquisite balance. *\\"Sarara's Little Shop\\" serves as contents which do business against various people, such as Hero and the Devil candidate student, in the world (a name is not \\"Kotonoha\\"), or venture such each one and a dungeon. = Mansions & Dragons = *The world \\"Kotonoha\\" of a sword and magic is a stage. The girl \\"Nuts\\" which aspire for Hero, and the adventure tale which the friends create. It is mainly drawn from the viewpoint by the side of Hero. A total of six volumes.Taiwan version and Thai version were also put on the market there. = Dark Loaders -The Devil's works- = *The world \\"Kotonoha\\" of a sword and magic is a stage. \\"Yusis\\" of the friend \\"Nuts\\" who determined becoming the Devil since it met with \\"Hero Nuts\\" left in order to beat the Devil again.The Devil is aimed at with girl \\"May\\" of Hero wish, managing the \\"Devil store\\" of the store for an adventure person.\\"Yusis\\" is making unrequited love \\"Nuts\\".

It is located within the deep white matter of each cerebellar hemisphere, and it is the largest single structure linking the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.Sultan, F., Hamodeh, S., & Baizer, J. S. (2010). THE HUMAN DENTATE NUCLEUS: A COMPLEX SHAPE UNTANGLED. [Article]. Neuroscience, 167(4), 965‚Äì968. It is the largest and most lateral, or farthest from the midline, of the four pairs of deep cerebellar nuclei, the others being the globose and emboliform nuclei, which together are referred to as the interposed nucleus, and the fastigial nucleus. The dentate nucleus is responsible for the planning, initiation and control of voluntary movements. The dorsal region of the dentate nucleus contains output channels involved in motor function, which is the movement of skeletal muscle, while the ventral region contains output channels involved in nonmotor function, such as conscious thought and visuospatial function.  Development  The dentate nucleus is highly convoluted, with gyri (ridges on the cerebral cortex) and sulci (furrows or grooves on the cerebral cortex). Its formation is coincident with a critical period of extensive growth in the fetal dentate. The dentate nucleus becomes visible in the cerebellar white matter as early as 11‚Äì12 weeks of gestation, containing only smooth lateral (towards the side(s) or away from the midline) and medial (towards the midline) surfaces. During this time, the neurons of the dentate nucleus are similar in shape and form, being mainly bipolar cells.Milosevic, N. T., Ristanovic, D., Maric, D. L., & Rajkovic, K. (2010). Morphology and cell classification of large neurons in the adult human dentate nucleus: A quantitative study. [Article]. Neuroscience Letters, 468(1), 59‚Äì63. During 22‚Äì28 weeks of gestation, which is the critical period in fetal development of the dentate nucleus, gyral formation occurs extensively over the entire surface. Here, neurons mature into various forms of multipolar cells,Yamaguchi, K., & Goto, N. (1997). Three-dimensional structure of the human cerebellar dentate nucleus: a computerized reconstruction study. [Article]. Anatomy and Embryology, 196(4), 343‚Äì348. and the most frequent neuronal types are medium sized to large neurons.  Structure  Location = Micrograph of the dentate nucleus (pale pink). H&E; stain. The architecture of cerebellum has a form that resembles the structure of a crystal, so a slice anywhere in the cerebellum gives repeated architecture. The eight cerebellar nuclei, located within the deep white matter of each cerebellar hemisphere, are grouped into pairs, with one of each pair in each of the two hemispheres. As a chunk of tissue, the dentate nucleus with overlying cerebellar cortex makes up a functional unit called the cerebrocerebellum. Thus, there is a part of cerebellum that communicates exclusively with the dentate nucleus.Saab, C. Y., & Willis, W. D. (2003). The cerebellum: organization, functions and its role in nociception. [Review]. Brain Research Reviews, 42(1), 85‚Äì95.  Deep cerebellar nuclei  *Dentate: The dentate nucleus is the largest, most lateral, and phylogenetically most recent of the cerebellar nuclei. It receives afferent, or incoming, signals from the premotor cortex and supplementary motor cortex via the pontocerebellar system. Efferent, or outgoing, signals travel via the superior cerebellar peduncle through the red nucleus to the contralateralhttp://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/cere/text/P5/dentate.htm ‚Äì opposite side ‚Äì Ventroanterior/Ventrolateral (VA/VL) thalamus.Ristanovic, D., Milosevic, N. T., Stefanovic, B. D., Maric, D. L., & Rajkovic, K. (2010). Morphology and classification of large neurons in the adult human dentate nucleus: A qualitative and quantitative analysis of 2D images. [Article]. Neuroscience Research, 67(1), 1‚Äì7. *Interposed: The globose and emboliform nuclei together make up the interposed nucleus. The interposed nucleus is the smallest of the cerebellar nuclei. It is located between the denate and fastigial nuclei. It receives afferent supply from the anterior (toward the front) lobe of the cerebellum and sends output to the contralateral red nucleus through the superior cerebellar peduncle. This nucleus is the origin of the rubrospinal tract that mainly influences limb flexor muscles.http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rswenson/NeuroSci/chapter_8B.html *Fastigial: The fastigial nucleus is the most medial. It receives afferent input from the vermis, and efferents travel via the inferior cerebellar peduncle to the vestibular nuclei. The deep cerebellar nuclei receive the final output from the cerebellar cortex via Purkinje cells in the form of inhibition. Neurons in the cerebellar nuclei generate spontaneous action potentials despite ongoing inhibition from Purkinje cells. The cerebellar nuclei receive afferent projections from the inferior olive, lateral reticular nucleus, upper cervical and lumbar spinal segments, and the Pontine nuclei. Together, the deep cerebellar nuclei form a functional unit that provides feedback control of the cerebellar cortex by cerebellar output. = Morphology = The dentate nucleus is highly convoluted and can be divided into dorsal (motor) and ventral (nonmotor) domains. The ventral half is much more developed in humans than in great apes, and it appears to play an important role in fiber connection. Further, the ventral domain mediates higher cerebellar functions, such as language and cognition, as well as versatile and coordinated finger movement.Matano, S. (2001). Brief communication: Proportions of the ventral half of the cerebellar dentate nucleus in humans and great apes. [Article]. American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 114(2), 163‚Äì165. While it is generally accepted that the ventral region is more recent on an evolutionary timescale, current 3-Dimensional imaging raises questions regarding this assumption, as a third axis, the rostrocaudal axis, can now be analyzed. In addition, current images show that the ventral region is not physically larger than the dorsal region in humans, as would be predicted if size increases with cognitive function. The neurons of the adult dentate are divided based on size, morphology, and function into large principal and small local circuit neurons.  Large principal neurons  The large principal neurons have been classified into four primary types according to position within the dentate, shape of soma (cell body), and dendritic branching. These neurons are responsible for communication between the dentate nucleus and the cerebellar cortex. *Central neurons: The central neurons are located in deeper parts of the nuclear mass, away from the periphery. They have round and prickly somata, and numerous dendritic trunks emerge from every direction of the soma. These dendrites have complex branching patterns and spherical dendritic fields. *Border neurons: The border neurons are concentrated at the boundary of the nuclear lamina and have elliptical somata. They have a stout axon directed into the surrounding white matter, as well as four to six primary dendrites that branch from the opposite end. The dendritic fields of these neurons have a tetrahedron shape with the cell body in one corner. *Intermediate asymmetric neurons: The intermediate asymmetrical neurons are evenly distributed throughout the nuclear mass, and they have large, elliptical somata. They have five to nine dendrites branching in all directions, with one or two much longer than the others. *Intermediate fusiform neurons: The intermediate fusiform neurons are scattered throughout the dentate, and they have elongated and elliptical somata which are tapered at both ends. They include three to five primary dendrites which divide into several long dendrites. The upper part of the cell body is parallel to the apical dendrites, which are oriented toward the nuclear core.  Small local circuit neurons  Small local circuit neurons include signaling pathways that are contained within the dentate. These neurons provide feedback to the dentate and allow for fine control of signaling. Currently, less research has been conducted on the specific shape and role of these neurons, as the dentate nucleus is composed primarily of large principal neurons.  Function  Projections = The dentate contains anatomically separate and functionally distinct motor and nonmotor domains (dorsal and ventral, respectively), and projections are organized from the dentate nucleus to distinct areas in the ventrolateral thalamus. In addition, the dorsal parts of the dentate project to the primary motor and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex, while the ventral parts of the dentate project to prefrontal and posterior parietal areas of the cerebral cortex.Dum, R. P., & Strick, P. L. (2003). An unfolded map of the cerebellar dentate nucleus and its projections to the cerebral cortex. [Article]. Journal of Neurophysiology, 89(1), 634‚Äì639. The motor and nonmotor domains make up approximately 50‚Äì60 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the dentate. It is estimated that the human dentate proportions are comparable. All cerebral cortical areas that are targeted by the dentate project back on the cerebellum via efferents to Pontine nuclei, and cortical areas that do not project onto the cerebellum are not targets of dentate output. The motor domain in the dorsal portion of the dentate contains output channels that control both generation and control of movement, as well as neurons that innervate premotor areas in the frontal lobe. The nonmotor domain contains output channels involved in cognition and visuospatial function, and projections to the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortical areas within this region are clustered into distinct regions with little overlap. These areas are activated during tasks involving short-term working memory, rule-based learning, and higher executive function-like planning. Although the ventral aspect of the dentate has been shown to be involved in acquisition of information, whether it is involved in retention and storage remains unclear.Mediavilla, C., Molina, F., & Puerto, A. (2000). Retention of concurrent taste aversion learning after electrolytic lesioning of the interpositus-dentate region of the cerebellum. [Article]. Brain Research, 868(2), 329‚Äì337. = Pathways = There are three distinct routes from the dentate nucleus to the ventrolateral thalamus, including a direct, posterior, and anterior route. The direct route passes in the anterolateral direction under the thalamus and enters from the ventral side. Axons following the posterior pathway turn dorsally from the midline at the posterior side of the thalamus, entering the thalamus from various positions. Axons following the anterior route pass laterally in the subthalamus and enter the external medullary lamina. Within the lamina, fibers turn posteriorly and enter the dorsal side of the thalamus. Therefore, as a result of these various pathways, the neurons of the dentate nucleus are able to traverse all thalamic nuclei, with the exception of those at the midline and anterior nuclear groups.Mason, A., Ilinsky, I. A., Maldonado, S., & Kultas-Ilinsky, K. (2000). Thalamic terminal fields of individual axons from the ventral part of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in Macaca mulatta. [Article]. Journal of Comparative Neurology, 421(3), 412‚Äì428. Dentate nucleus axons can be divergent or convergent. Convergent branches include those that originate from entirely different axons and traverse different routes, yet overlap on the same terminal field. Divergent pathways originate from the same axon but travel different routes and target different terminal fields. Although no point-to- point connectivity has been observed between the dentate nucleus and the thalamus, it is believed that there is a pre-wired connectivity between a single dentate site and several body part representations in the thalamus. Three modalities are received by cerebellum, including proprioception, nociception, and somatic input, and all of these stimulate the dentate nucleus. The dentate nucleus is mostly responsible for planning and execution of fine movement. Since any motor function requires sensory information, it can be assumed that the dentate nucleus receives and modulates this sensory information, though the specific mechanism of this remains unclear. For example, the act of lifting an object requires sensory input, such as the size of the object and where it is located in space. While the primary role of the dentate nucleus is control of the movement, it does play a role in sensory processing as well. = Role = The role of the dentate nucleus can be described in two basic tenets: # The dentate nucleus is involved in basic circuitry work, including input to the cerebellum from everywhere else. Any function that needs coordination, including thoughts and motor behavior, must go through the cerebellum to be smoothened. This input travels in two parts, to the surface of the cerebellar cortex as well as collateral input to the cerebellar nuclei. # The whole cerebellum has only one output, which necessarily leads from the deep cerebellar nuclei. There is output from the cerebellar cortex, so this output must go through the cerebellar nuclei and send output to rest of nervous system. Thus, the cerebellum communicates to the outside world via the cerebellar nuclei. Input that reaches the cerebellar cortex is processed in many ways; eventually whatever happens in cerebellar cortex exits the cerebellum through a synapse in the cerebellar nuclei. The dentate nucleus is responsible for the planning, initiation and control of voluntary movements. The dorsal region of the dentate contains output channels involved in motor function, while the ventral region contains output channels involved in nonmotor function, such as cognition and visuospatial function. The dentate nucleus sends commands and information to the motor and premotor areas in the forebrain.  Clinical significance Several pathological processes involve the dentate nucleus including metabolic, genetic, and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as some infections. = Metabolic disorders = Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD): An inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism in newborns, MSUD results in neurological deterioration. Myelin edema is seen in the cerebellum, including the dentate nucleus, brain stem, and corticospinal tracts.McErlean, A., Abdalla, K., Donoghue, V., & Ryan, S. (2010). The dentate nucleus in children: normal development and patterns of disease. [Article]. Pediatric Radiology, 40(3), 326‚Äì339. Leigh disease: Clinical and pathological symptoms usually appear in the first year of life and include psychomotor retardation and brain stem dysfunction. Bilaterally symmetric defects are seen in the periaqueductal grey matter, brain stem, basal ganglia, and dentate nucleus. Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1): An autosomal recessive disease, GA1 is due to glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. Abnormalities are seen in the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus. Canavan's disease: Canavan's disease is a white matter disease due to aspartoacylase deficiency. The dentate nucleus is not affected until late in disease progression. = Miscellaneous disorders = Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): NF1 is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder. The hallmark of NF1 is the development of numerous tumors. Cerebellar white matter and dentate nucleus lesions usually occur in children less than ten years of age. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): LCH is an aggressive disorder due to proliferation of Langerhans cell hystiocytes, and the dentate nucleus is believed to be involved in up to 40 percent of patients. Alzheimer's disease (AD) with myoclonus: There is an increase in mean volume of large neurons and a decrease in mean volume of small neurons in the dentate nucleus in AD with myoclonus. Morphological changes in the dentate nucleus may contribute to the pathological substrate of myoclonus in AD.Fukutani, Y., Cairns, N. J., Everall, I. P., Chadwick, A., Isaki, K., & Lantos, P. L. (1999). Cerebellar dentate nucleus in Alzheimer's disease with myoclonus. [Article]. Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders, 10(2), 81‚Äì88.

To represent it, the understroke diacritic in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is used, . It may be instead represented by an overstroke, if the symbol that it modifies has a descender, such as in .International Phonetic Association, Handbook, pp. 14‚Äì15. Syllabic consonants in most languages are sonorants, such as nasals and liquids. Very few have syllabic obstruents, such as stops and fricatives in normal words, but English has syllabic fricatives in paralinguistic words like shh! and zzz. ExamplesGermanic languages= In many varieties of High and Low German, pronouncing syllabic consonants may be considered a shibboleth. In High German and Tweants (a Low Saxon dialect spoken in the Netherlands, more Low Saxon dialects have the syllabic consonant), all word-final syllables in infinite verbs and feminine plural nouns spelled -en are pronounced with syllabic consonants. The High German infinitive ' (to walk) is pronounced or (in some accents) even and its Tweants counterpart ' is pronounced . Tweants scholars even debate whether or not this feature should be incorporated in spelling, resulting in two generally accepted spelling forms (either loopn or lopen). Many dialects of English may use syllabic consonants in words such as even , awful and rhythm , which English dictionaries' respelling systems usually treat as realizations of underlying sequences of schwa and a consonant ().For example, see the Pronunciation guide of the Merriam-Webster dictionary. In Danish, a syllabic consonant is the standard colloquial realization of combinations of the phoneme schwa and a sonorant, generally referred to as schwa-assimilation, e.g. ' (the cat) = , ' (lady) = , ' (bike) = , ' (ant) = , ' (sleep) = , ' (shrimp) = , ' (the house) = . In all four dialect groups of Norwegian, a syllabic alveolar nasal, /n/, may be heard. It is syllabic when following other alveolar consonants and occurs most often in the definite singular form of masculine nouns (see Norwegian grammar) where the schwa has elided, e.g. ' (the car) , where it was originally . With some speakers, the schwa may be have been reinserted, especially for words already ending in /n/ where the syllabic /n/ may have been entirely elided afterward, e.g. ' (the man) can either be pronounced like , or Sand√∏y, H. (1993) \\"Talem√•l\\", Novus forlag, Oslo. .Skjekkeland, M. 1997 \\"Dei norske dialektane - Tradisjonelle s√¶rdrag i jamf√∏ring med skriftm√•la\\", H√∏yskoleforlaget AS, Kristiansand S. . . In addition to this, a syllabic /n/ always occurs in words like (water) and (bottom) . This syllabification of alveolar nasals also appears in some Swedish dialects . In all cases where the alveolar sound becomes retroflex, /n/ also becomes retroflex /…≥/, e.g. ' (the moustache) (see Norwegian phonology#Consonants). A contrastively syllabic retroflex /…≥/ can also be seen in words like ' (the bar) and (child) . In some Norwegian dialects, a syllabic alveolar lateral approximant /l/ may be heard in the same circumstances as syllabic /n/, e.g. ' (poodle) , though it is not as common as syllabic /n/. A syllabic /l/ may also be heard in Bergen, where a following syllabic /n/ has elided completely, e.g. ' (the sun) .Pettersen, E. 1990 \\"Bergens bym√•l\\", Novus Forlag AS, Oslo. In dialects that have palatalisation of some alveolar consonants like Northern Norwegian and Tr√∏ndersk, the following syllabic /n/ is also palatalised, e.g. ' (the ball) . Obstruents All of the consonants syllabicized in Germanic languages are sonorants. However, the only time obstruents are used syllabically in English is in onomatopoeia, such as sh! (a command to be quiet), sss (the hiss of a snake), zzz (the sound of a bee buzzing or someone sleeping), and tsk tsk! (used to express disapproval or pity), though it is not certain how to define what a syllable is in such cases. =Sanskrit= Sanskrit ‡§ã and ‡§å are syllabic consonants, allophones of consonantal and . This continues the reconstructed situation of Proto-Indo- European, where both liquids and nasals had syllabic allophones, . =Slavic languages= Many Slavic languages allow syllabic consonants. Some examples include: * Czech and Slovak r and l , as in the phrase ' 'stick your finger through the throat' (in both languages). Slovak also has long versions of these syllabic consonants, ≈ï and ƒ∫, e.g.: ' 'joint', ' 'willow', ' '(of) spots'. Czech also has mÃ© and nÃ©, e.g.: ' 'seven'. * Slovene , and in non- native words, e.g. Vltava.Topori≈°iƒç, Jo≈æe. 1992. Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika.

In Serbian dialects between the Kupa river and Velebit of pre-war Croatia, other consonants are also syllabic.

In Cantonese, the former is most often used in the word meaning 'not' (, ) while the latter can be seen in the word for 'five' (, ) and the surname Ng (, or , , depending on the tone), among others. Syllabic fricatives A number of languages have syllabic fricatives or fricative vowels. In several varieties of Chinese, certain high vowels following fricatives or affricates are pronounced as extensions of those sounds, with voicing added (if not already present) and a vowel pronounced while the tongue and teeth remain in the same position as for the preceding consonant, leading to the turbulence of a fricative carrying over into the vowel. In Mandarin Chinese, this happens for example with sƒ´, shƒ´, and rƒ´. Traditional grammars describing them as having a \\"buzzing\\" sound. A number of modern linguistsJerry Norman (1988). Chinese (Cambridge Linguistic Surveys). Cambridge University Press. P. 142.S. Robert Ramsey (1987). The Languages of China. Princeton University Press. P. 45. describe them as true syllabic fricatives, although with weak frication. They are accordingly transcribed respectively.San Duanmu (2008). \\"Syllable Structure in Chinese\\" (ch. 4). In Syllable Structure. Oxford. 304 pp. Accessed Feb 21, 2013. However, for many speakers, the friction carries over only into the beginning of the vowel.UCLA Phonetics Lab Data: . The tongue and teeth remain where they were, but the tongue contact is lessened a bit to allow for a high approximant vowel with no frication except at the beginning, during the transition. John Wells at University College LondonJohn Wells (March 15, 2007). \\"Chinese apical vowels. John Wells's phonetic blog. Accessed Feb 21, 2013. uses the detailed transcriptions for si and for shi (ignoring the tone), with the superscript indicating the \\"color\\" of the sound and a lowering diacritic on the z to indicate that the tongue contact is relaxed enough to prevent frication. Another researcher suggests and for si and shi, respectively, to indicate that the frication of the consonant may extend onto the vowel.Kwan-hin Cheung, 1992. \\"Âåó‰∫¨Ë©± 'Áü•' 'Ë≥á' ‰∫åÈüªÂúãÈöõÈü≥Ê®ôÂØ´Ê≥ïÂïÜÊ¶∑\\" [IPA transcription of the so-called 'apical vowels' in Pekinese], in T. Lee, ed., Research on Chinese Linguistics in Hong Kong, Linguistic Society of Hong Kong. Some speakers have even more lax articulation, opening the teeth and noticeably lowering the tongue, so that sƒ´ shƒ´ rƒ´ are pronounced , with the same vowel in each case and no r-coloring. Standard Liangshan Yi has two similar \\"buzzed\\" vowels that are described as syllabic fricatives, . The former may even be trilled . Sinologists and linguists working in the Chinese analytical tradition frequently use the term apical vowel ( Sh√©jiƒÅn yu√°n yƒ´n) to describe the sounds above and others like them in various Sino-Tibetan languages. However, this is a misnomer, as the tongue is actually laminal. The nonstandard symbols are commonly used to transcribe these vowels in place of or , respectively. The term apical vowel should not be taken as synonymous with syllabic fricative, as e.g., the bilabial syllabic fricative in Liangshan Yi is not pronounced with the tongue. =Other languages= Berber, Salish, Wakashan and Chemakuan languages have syllabic obstruents in normal vocabulary, such as Nux√°lk , \\"northeast wind\\", or \\"seal blubber\\", \\"wet\\", \\"dry\\", or \\"we () used to () sing ()\\". In Standard Yoruba, the consonants m and n may be syllabic and carry tone like vowels. However, they always stand alone as syllables and cannot stand as syllable nuclei. In Baoul√©, m or n may be syllabic. As a stand-alone word, it means \\"I\\" (first person subject pronoun), as in ' \\"I speak Baoul√©\\". Its quality varies with the consonant following it, as in ' \\"I will come tomorrow\\". The Hungarian word ' , a high-register variant of √©s \\"and\\", is a syllabic consonant. Japanese is frequently described as having a syllabic N, which has its own \\"syllabic\\" letter in Japanese kana, but it is actually moraic. The only actual syllabic consonant is a syllabic nasal as an informal variant of un \\"yeah\\", similar to syllabic nasals with similar meanings in English.

He won the 1972 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography for his portfolio of photographs of the Vietnam War, Cambodia, East Pakistani refugees near Calcutta, and the Ali-Frazier fight in Madison Square Garden. He has photographed every American president since Lyndon B Johnson. He is the first Presidential Scholar at the University of Arizona.  Early life  Kennerly is the son of O.A. \\"Tunney\\" Kennerly, a traveling salesman, and Joanne Hume Kennerly. His parents are deceased. He also has three younger sisters, Jane and Chris, the youngest, Anne, is also deceased. His interest in photography started when he was only 12, and his career began in Roseburg, where his first published picture was in the high school newspaper The Orange 'R in 1962. Kennerly graduated from West Linn High School in West Linn, Oregon, in 1965. He briefly attended Portland State College but left at 19 to become a staff photographer for The Oregon Journal. In 1967 he entered the Oregon National Guard and was sent to Fort Leonard Wood Missouri for basic training and then advanced training at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana. After completing six months of active duty in the US Army, he was hired as staff photographer by The Oregonian. During his early career in Portland he photographed some major personalities, including Miles Davis, Igor Stravinsky, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, The Rolling Stones, and The Supremes. That encounter with Sen. Kennedy gave him the determination to become a national political photographer. In late 1967, Kennerly moved to Los Angeles to become a staff photographer for United Press International (UPI). On June 5, 1968 he took some of the last photos of Senator Robert F. Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel as he declared victory in the California presidential primary. Moments later Kennedy was gunned down by the assassin Sirhan Sirhan. That night Kennerly also took a memorable picture of Ethel Kennedy in the back of an ambulance. The following year Kennerly moved to New York for UPI, where among many other assignments he photographed the \\"Miracle\\" New York Mets winning the 1969 World Series. In early 1970, Kennerly was transferred to the Washington, D.C. bureau of UPI. At age 23 he took his first ride on Air Force One with President Nixon as a member of the traveling press pool. However Kennerly believed he was missing out on the biggest story of his generation, the Vietnam War. He said, \\"I felt like that scene in Mr. Roberts where Henry Fonda, an officer on a supply ship, watched the destroyers sail into battle while he was stuck in some South Pacific backwater port.\\" Kennerly was sent to Saigon in early 1971 as a combat photographer for UPI. Unbeknownst to Kennerly, UPI photo editor Larry DeSantis started a portfolio of his favorite Kennerly photographs of the year, beginning with the Ali-Frazier fight photo that ran on the front page of the New York Times on March 9, 1971, (and also happened to be Kennerly's 24th birthday). DeSantis submitted that photograph along with images of the Vietnam and Cambodia wars and refugees escaping from East Pakistan into India to the Pulitzer Prize Board for consideration. It was only when the winners were announced that Kennerly, who was still in Vietnam, learned he had been awarded the 1972 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography. The committee noted that he \\"specialized in pictures that capture the loneliness and desolation of war.\\" Kennerly became the photo bureau chief for UPI in Southeast Asia, but still spent most of his time in the field covering combat operations. In September 1972 he was one of three Americans to travel to the People's Republic of China to cover the state visit of Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. During that assignment he photographed Premier Zhou Enlai, one of the most influential Chinese leaders in modern history. While still in Vietnam, he joined Life in November 1972 as a contract photographer. After the classic picture magazine folded a few weeks later, Kennerly stayed on as a contract photographer for Time. Among the many stories he covered for them while still in Asia was the last American prisoner of war release in Hanoi, March 30, 1973. Kennerly returned to the United States in the summer of 1973 for Time, right in the middle of the Watergate story. He photographed the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew, and the selection of Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford as Agnew's replacement. Kennerly's first Time cover was of Congressman Ford, a photo he took the day before Nixon selected Ford, and it was also Ford's first appearance on the front of Time. That session with Ford led to a close personal relationship with him and his family. After Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9, 1974, the new president selected him to be his Chief Official White House Photographer. Kennerly was only the third civilian to ever have that position, (the first was President Lyndon B. Johnson photographer Yoichi Okamoto, and Nixon's photographer Oliver F. Atkins). Kennerly enjoyed unprecedented entree during the Ford Presidency, and photographed major meetings, events, and trips during Ford's tenure in office. He also arranged unique access for photographic colleagues from the magazines, newspapers, and wire service during that period. More than 50 photographers were granted exclusives with President Ford. There had never been that kind of access for outside photographers to a president before, or since. It was one of Kennerly's proudest achievements. His staff consisted of four other photographers who divided coverage of the First Lady and Vice President, as well as presidential duties. He also directed the White House photo lab that was run by the military as part of the White House Communications Agency. Kennerly's White House photographs and negatives are physically housed at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on the campus of Ford's alma mater, the University of Michigan. Many of his photos are also on display at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In late March 1975, Kennerly accompanied U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Frederick Weyand who had been dispatched on a presidential mission to South Vietnam to assess what was becoming a rapidly deteriorating military situation. The president privately told Kennerly he wanted his view of what was happening. In his autobiography Ford wrote, \\"I knew David wouldn‚Äôt try to give me any propaganda about ‚Äòenemy body counts‚Äô or ‚Äòlight at the end of the tunnel.‚Äô He had been shot at many times by the North Vietnamese. As an American, he felt ashamed that we weren't doing more to help a loyal ally, and he thought that once I saw the photographs he took of the suffering there, I would have a better feel for what we had to do.\\" Kennerly flew around the country, escaped from Nha Trang before it fell to the advancing communists, was shot at by retreating South Vietnamese soldiers at Cam Ranh Bay, and landed under fire in Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a quick visit and assessment of the situation. When he returned from the trip, both Weyand's and Kennerly's assessments were bleak. The President ordered that Kennerly's stark black-and- white photos of the tragedy be put up in the halls of the West Wing of the White House to remind the staff just how bad things were. Saigon fell a month later. Before the fall, Ford had ordered the evacuation of the last Americans and many Vietnamese who had been working for the United States. The photos that Kennerly took on that mission helped convince Ford to open the doors to allow tens of thousands of other Vietnamese refugees into the country. The day before the Fords were turning over the keys to the White House to incoming President Jimmy Carter, Kennerly accompanied Betty Ford around the West Wing as she said goodbyes to the staff. They walked by the empty Cabinet Room and a mischievous look came across her face. \\"I've always wanted to dance on the Cabinet Room table,\\" she said. The former Martha Graham dancer kicked off her shoes, jumped up on the middle of the table, and struck a pose. The photo was published for the first time 15 years after he took it in Kennerly's book Photo Op. During the Carter presidency there was no official White House photographer, in part because Carter did not like Kennerly's high public profile during Ford's Administration. Kennerly who was 27 when he took the job, and single, dated several high-profile women, including the actress Candice Bergen and the Olympic skier Suzy Chaffee, and was regularly mentioned in gossip columns popular media. After the White House, Kennerly went back on contract for Time Magazine, where he covered some of the biggest stories of the 1970s and 1980s for them; Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's trip to Israel, the horror of Jonestown, exclusive photos of President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's first meeting in Geneva in 1985, the Fireside Summit, and many other stories around the world. When Life Magazine made a brief comeback for Desert Storm in 1991, he shot an inside story on Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell for them called \\"Men of War.\\" In 1996, Kennerly became a contributing editor for Newsweek where he produced inside stories on President Bill Clinton, Senator Bob Dole, the Impeachment Hearings, special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, the 2000 elections, the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon, and other top stories. Kennerly also had a contract with John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s magazine George. While still working for Newsweek, Kennerly was assigned to cover the 2000 Presidential election campaigns, initially covering the candidacy of Senator John McCain until his withdrawal on March 9, 2000. On election night November 7, Kennerly was at the Governor's Mansion in Austin with Gov. George W. Bush after Vice President Al Gore first conceded the election and later recanted. Kennerly has covered every presidential campaign from 1968 through 2020 with the exception of 1972, when he was in Vietnam. Throughout his journalism career, Kennerly has photographed more than 35 covers for Time and Newsweek, and covered assignments in over 130 countries. Kennerly was a Fellow in the American Film Institute directing program in 1984‚Äì86. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy as executive producer of NBC's The Taking of Flight 847, and was the writer and executive producer of a two-hour NBC pilot, Shooter, starring Helen Hunt, based on his Vietnam experiences. Shooter won the Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography. He was executive producer of the Academy Award short-listed documentary Portraits of a Lady for HBO, directed by Neil Leifer and starring former Justice of the Supreme Court Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor. In 2013, Kennerly collaborated with Emmy Award-winning filmmakers Gedeon Naudet, Jules Naudet, and producer Chris Whipple on a documentary The Gatekeepers, a four- hour Discovery Channel documentary about the White House chiefs of staff. The team joined forces again in 2015 to produce The Spymasters, a documentary for CBS/Showtime about the directors of the CIA. In 2016, Kennerly covered the presidential election for CNN, and took an exclusive of President-elect Donald Trump for the cover of their book Unprecedented. Trump tweeted that it was \\"the worst cover photo of me!\\" even though he had told Kennerly he liked it when he saw it in the back of the camera during the shoot. Kennerly is a frequent public speaker, and has appeared at events such as TEDx, RootsTech, the University of Arizona, and a multitude of corporate events. In addition to his photojournalism work, Kennerly has also worked as a corporate photographer, and for the last ten years his main client has been Bank of America. In 2010, Kennerly photographed a campaign for the Girl Scouts of America that included new images for the outside of the Girl Scout cookie boxes, pictures that endured for more than ten years. In October 2018, University of Arizona President Robert C. Robbins named Kennerly as the university's first Presidential Scholar. \\"The images captured by David Hume Kennerly document some of the most important moments in history over the past 60 years, and they have changed how several generations have viewed the world. We are honored to have David share his experience with our students and community.\\" The following year, UA's Center for Creative Photography (CCP) announced the acquisition of the David Hume Kennerly Archive, which features more than one million images, prints, objects, memorabilia, correspondence and documents dating back to 1957. In announcing the acquisition CCP Director Anne Breckenridge Barrett said \\"Adding the Kennerly Archive to our collection allows the Center to connect the relevance of Kennerly‚Äôs work to the photographic legacies we house. It is a critical contribution to the Center‚Äôs commitment to expanding the understanding of the role photography plays in today‚Äôs society.\\" The acquisition highlights the decades long relationship between Kennerly and Ansel Adams, one of the co-founders of CCP. The two first became acquainted when Kennerly invited Adams to the White House to meet with President Ford in 1975. In 1979 Kennerly photographed Adams for the cover of Time, the only time a photographer has been featured on the cover of the magazine. =Personal life= He was married to Susan Allwardt in 1967‚Äì69, actress Mel Harris from 1983‚Äì1988, actress Carol Huston in 1989‚Äì92, and Rebecca Soladay from 1994 to the present. =Accomplishments= Kennerly at the White House in 1981 *Trustee, The Gerald R.

It has yellow flowers with a scent which some find objectionable. Since there were no yellow roses native to Europe, its introduction from Persia was an important addition to the cultivation of roses, and R. foetida is now an important contributor to the stock of cultivated roses. Name The rose is named for its smell--foetida is Latin for \\"having a bad smell\\"‚Äîwhich is reminiscent of boiled linseed oil, a smell which some find objectionable. However, according to others \\"the smell is not all that bad.\\" Cultivation history Rosa foetida was imported to Europe from Persia (R. foetida 'persiana' being the name of one of its varieties), and was important to European horticulture since it had no native yellow roses. It was described (in 1583) and successfully cultivated by Carolus Clusius; he grew them in the imperial garden of Rudolf II in Vienna. Its popularity was aided by Clusius's contemporary, Flemish painter and engraver Joris Hoefnagel, who contrasted it with the Eglantine rose in a manuscript illustration. An important rose, inasmuch as it is the source of yellow in modern-day hybrids, most famously 'Soleil d'Or' (R. foetida x 'Antoine Ducher'; 1900), was bred by Joseph Pernet-Ducher. One variety, Rosa foetida var. 'bicolor' , the Austrian Copper rose, blooms early in the season and has flowers with petals that are red or orange on the upper interior surface but yellow on the lower exterior surface. Rosa foetida has exerted great influence on the modern stock of cultivated roses, contributing also its susceptibility to black spot. Description and cultivation The rose is described as a \\"spindly bush, not terribly vigorous\\", requiring a stake or a wall, growing up to six feet tall.

It is affiliated with the Church of the United Brethren in Christ and a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU).  History  Huntington University opened as \\"Central College\\" in 1897 after the General Board of Education of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ proposed a new institution of higher learning in Huntington, Indiana. This came soon after the closure of Hartsville College, the denomination's college in Hartsville, Indiana.Twenty-Eighth Biennial Report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for the School Years Ending July 31, 1915, and July 31, 1916 (Fort Wayne, 1917), 156-8. United Brethren Bishop Milton Wright, father of Orville and Wilbur Wright, served as professor of theology at Hartsville in 1868-1869 and later presided over the dedication ceremony of Central College on September 21, 1897. Hartsville supplied the initial faculty and students for Central College, which offered a coeducational program for both men and women and attracted international students from Sierra Leone, Japan, and elsewhere. In its earliest decades, the college developed a curriculum in the liberal arts tradition, with courses leading to the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Philosophy degrees. Programs in the fields of oratory, music, education, and business were included as well. The college's approach to education was both classical and progressive, as reflected in early endeavors such as a campus performance of Shakespeare's \\"As You Like It\\" in 1906, directed by professor of oratory Nellie Binning. Among the first student publications and organizations were the Central Literary Data (later The Huntingtonian), the Philomathean Literary Society, the Zetalethean Literary Society, and the Debating Club, as well as student singing clubs and athletic teams for both sexes.The Mnemosyne, The Yearbook of Huntington College, Huntington Indiana, 1923. Japanese student Matajeiro Umeeda completed requirements for the college's new master's degree in 1903 with a thesis titled \\"Confucianism and Christianity.\\"\\"Centennial Alumni Directory\\" (Huntington College, 1997). In addition to its classical program of study, the college staffed courses in the applied sciences, and courses aimed at professional training for teachers and ministers. Botanist Dr. Fred A. Loew (1874-1950; A.M, Michigan State; Sc.D. Huntington College) built a herbarium (1903), agricultural research station (1914), and botanical garden (1937) at the college, signaling the institution's commitment to theoretical science as well as the practical application of scientific research.Julie Crothers, \\"University Herbarium Unlocks Lessons for Students,\\" The Indianapolis Star, January 5, 2014; \\"Fred Aaron Loew,\\" Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science, Volume 61 (1951): 21-22. The college and its students also benefitted from the early involvement of Jacob L. Brenn (1896-1967), a Jewish chemist from Poland who started Huntington Laboratories (now Ecolab) in 1919 and served as founding President of the Huntington College Foundation (1938), which provided financial support for the institution. The Brenn family donated a large sum to help build the college's first major science building, Brenn Hall of Science (1963). Having changed its name to Huntington College in 1917, the institution further clarified its mission as a traditional, four-year liberal arts college in the 1920s. The pre-collegiate Academy was closed and its two-year academic tracks were developed into four-year baccalaureate programs. Furthermore, the college secured state accreditation for its teacher training program. These positive trends were checked by the onset of the Great Depression when enrollment dwindled and funding became scarce. Although the denomination's Board of Education voted to suspend operations in 1932, they ultimately reversed their decision and opened as usual. World War II further challenged student recruitment efforts, with fall enrollment in 1942 bottoming out at 83 students (only 28 men).Jeffrey B. Webb, \\"Huntington College, Liberal Education, and the Struggle for 'Christian Democracy' in the World War II Era,\\" in Denominational Higher Education in World War II, edited by John Laukaitis (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), 219. The G.I. Bill brought increased enrollment in the late 1940s and 1950s, and the administration began to pursue accreditation for the institution as a whole. This was achieved when the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (now the Higher Learning Commission) conferred accreditation in 1961. Further validation of the quality of Huntington's academic programs arrived in 1971 when the college was admitted to the Associated Colleges of Indiana (now the Independent Colleges of Indiana). The 1970s was a formative era in the modern history of the college. Future Vice President Dan Quayle of Huntington taught as an adjunct instructor and served on the Board of Trustees. On campus, Steve Platt led the nation in collegiate scoring for two seasons and eventually set the record for collegiate scoring in the state of Indiana (3,700 points). He was inducted in the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996. The careers of Quayle and Platt put Huntington in the national spotlight, and in the 1970s the college received its first gift from Ruth and Orville Merillat, a $1 million donation to help build a new physical education, athletics, and recreation facility. Over the next twenty years, the college benefitted greatly from the philanthropic efforts of the Merillat family as the campus expanded and new buildings appeared to serve a growing student body. Key facilities at Huntington bearing the Merillat family name include the Merillat Complex, the Merillat Centre for the Arts, and the RichLyn Library (named in honor of Lynette and Richard Merillat). In the 1980s and 1990s the college enjoyed increasing recognition for its academic programs and its commitment to excellence in Christian liberal arts education. Faculty who earned Huntington College a heightened appreciation for its intellectual rigor included Dr. R. William Hasker (1935- ; Ph.D. Edinburgh), author of God, Time, and Knowledge (Cornell, 1989) and The Emergent Self (Cornell, 1999) and Dr. Paul Michelson (1945- ; Ph.D. Indiana), a prolific author and leading expert in the field of southeastern European history. Michelson served as past president of the Society for Romanian Studies and won the Balcescu Prize for History by the Romanian Academy (2000). The college also recruited James O'Donnell (MBA Columbia) to serve as executive-in-residence, and he brought a career's worth of experience in finance at Fidelity and Dreyfus to his courses and mentorship. O'Donnell authored several books on investments, and his essays have been featured in Barron‚Äôs, The Wall Street Journal, Fortune, and America. The institution adopted its current name in 2005, and expanded graduate offerings in occupational therapy (OTD) in 2014 and business (MBA) in 2017 to add to existing master's level programs in counseling, ministry, organizational leadership, and education. This program of expansion also included locating campuses in Fort Wayne for its doctoral program in occupational therapy, and in Peoria, Arizona for its undergraduate film, broadcast media, and animation programs. Campus Founded in 1897 by the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Huntington University is located on a contemporary, lakeside campus in northeast Indiana. The campus comprises 160 acres with grassy areas, trees and Lake Sno-Tip. Thornhill Nature Preserve is a nature preserve that provides outdoor educational opportunities through the Reiff Nature Center, ropes course, and various community events. The Merillat Centre for the Arts is a fine arts center that includes the Robert E. Wilson Gallery, as well as the Huntington University departments of art, music, and theatre. There are seven residence halls on Huntington's campus. They are Wright, Hardy, Roush, Baker, Miller, Meadows and Livingston Halls. Students can also live in Forester Village, an upperclassmen apartment complex. The institution also supports academic programs at the Parkview Hospital Randallia campus in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and at the Huntington University Arizona Center in Peoria, Arizona. Organization Huntington University has a \\"strong historic and ongoing relationship with the Church of the United Brethren in Christ,\\" an evangelical denomination headquartered in Huntington, Indiana.  Academics  Huntington University offers graduate and undergraduate programs in more than 80 academic disciplines.  Athletics  The Huntington University Foresters compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Crossroads League,Mid-Central Conference Membership List formerly known as the Mid-Central College Conference (MCC). The Foresters also compete as a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field and volleyball.Official web site: Huntington University athletics Student life Huntington University students have the opportunity to participate in a number of activities and service opportunities throughout the year. The Friesen Center for Volunteer Service provides students with a range of service projects and programs, including local blood drives and short-term mission experiences. Students may also run for office on Student Government Association and represent their classmates. Student Government Association \\"serves as a liaison between students and faculty/staff/administration, and addresses issues that pertain to the student body.\\" Huntington University's Student Activities Board, more commonly known as SAB, is a student-led organization responsible for planning and facilitating student events. The board plans and hosts more than a dozen annual events at Huntington University, including hoedowns, mud volleyball, laser tag, movies and concerts. SAB also facilitates Olympiad, a popular 4-day event composed of various athletic games and challenges. There are nearly 30 other student organizations available to students at Huntington University, from academic groups and honors societies to interest groups and clubs.

It is located in the roof (dorsal aspect) of the fourth ventricle, lateral to the fastigial nucleus. It receives its afferent supply from the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and sends output via the superior cerebellar peduncle to the red nucleus. The interposed nucleus is located in the paravermis of the cerebellum. It receives input from the ipsilateral posterior external arcuate fibers (cuneocerebellar tract) and the dorsal spinocerebellar tract, which originate in the accessory cuneate nucleus and the posterior thoracic nucleus, respectively. The interposed nucleus is responsible for coordinating agonist/antagonist muscle pairs, and therefore a lesion in this area causes tremor. The interposed nucleus is smaller than the dentate but larger than the fastigial nucleus. Function Functionally, it modulates muscle stretch reflexes of proximal limb muscles. The cerebellar interpositus nucleus is also required in delayed Pavlovian conditioning.

The station is on Station Drive, to the northeast of Ludlow town centre. History The station opened on 21 April 1852, as the southern terminus of the first section of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway. Trains travelling to or from the south of the station pass through the short Ludlow Tunnel ( long), which passes under Gravel Hill and has its tunnel entrance immediately south of the platforms. A quarter of a mile to the north of the station was Clee Hill Junction, where from 1864 to 1962 a branch line ran to the quarries in the nearby Clee Hills to the east of Ludlow. The engine shed closed in 1951 and the goods yard on 6 May 1968. In the late 1960s, the Victorian buildings at the station were demolished and the last signal boxes closed. Accidents and incidents *At 3.15 am on 6 September 1956, a northbound parcels train overran signals and ran into the rear of a Penzance to Manchester express passenger train carrying 150 passengers but caused no deaths and only one serious shock casualty. The passenger train had halted because a lorry that had crashed into a level crossing at Onibury station had blocked the track.'Nostalgia' special report by Toby Neal. Passenger services Passenger services are currently provided by Transport For Wales. The station is served by one to two trains per hour in each direction Mondays to Saturdays, and around fifteen trains each way on Sundays. There are direct trains to , Manchester Piccadilly, Shrewsbury, Hereford, , , Milford Haven, and . The only passenger services running on the line that do not call at Ludlow are the two North-South Wales express services that run Monday to Friday in each direction.GB eNRT December 2015 Edition, Table 131 Ludlow is the fourth busiest station by passenger numbers in Shropshire after Shrewsbury, Telford Central and Wellington. Facilities and access Looking south towards Ludlow Tunnel, with the ticket office on the right. There are two platforms ‚Äî platform 1 is the northbound platform (for Shrewsbury) and platform 2 is the southbound platform (for Hereford). Whilst there is level access to the ticket office and platform 1, the footbridge can only be reached by steps from that platform, and level access to platform 2 is via a ramp down from Quarry Gardens; a long path provides a level access route that runs over the tunnel entrance between the platforms. Facilities include a staffed ticket office (where railway-related books and light refreshments are available to buy), car parking, weatherproof platform shelters, and an accessible adapted toilet. The station is served by Ludlow's two frequent 'town' bus services, the 701 and 722.

The open campus occupies a site in the centre of the town of Dollar in the county of Clackmannanshire, at the foot of the Ochil Hills. Overview As of 2020, there are over 1200 pupils at Dollar Academy, making it the sixth largest independent school in Scotland. On a single campus, it is divided into three separate schools: the Prep School (Preps I to V for ages 5‚Äì10), the Junior School (Juniors I and II for ages 10‚Äì12) and the Senior School (Forms I to VI for ages 12 going on 18). Around 90 of the pupils are boarders; the rest are day pupils, either from the village of Dollar itself or from the surrounding counties of Clackmannanshire, Stirlingshire, Perth and Kinross and Fife. Almost 50% of the boarding pupils are from overseas, with the rest being British nationals. The overall share of international students is relatively low at about 20% of all students. Dollar Academy has over 70 sports and recreational activities on offer to pupils after the school day and over the weekend. Academic Dollar Academy follows the Scottish education system, with pupils sitting National 5 examinations at the end of Form IV and Highers at the end of Form V/VI. Most courses in Form VI are at Advanced Higher level and a number of pupils study the Scottish Baccalaureate. All standard subjects are on offer at Dollar Academy. The school also teaches Classical Studies, Latin, Greek and Mandarin. IT training is provided to all, and music, art, and drama are compulsory for Forms 1 and 2.  Combined Cadet Force  Dollar Academy's CCF (Combined Cadet Force) have won the Scottish Schools' CCF Military skills competition (formerly the Highland CCF Tactical Competition) several times and most recently in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Dollar Academy's CCF was also the first Scottish CCF to win the Welbeck DSFC Cadet Leadership Challenge in 2013 and repeated this in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019. The CCF First Aid team has also enjoyed great success with the cadet team winning at Scottish and National level every year since 2003. The school is also the only Scottish school in the last fifty years to win the Ashburton Shield at Bisley, winning in 2005 and 2013. The school has two main pipe bands. The \\"A\\" band won the Scottish Schools CCF Pipes and Drums competition every year from 2000 to 2012 and 2014 and 2015, as well as winning the RSPBA World Pipe Band Championships in 2010, 2014 and 2015. In 2013, the band was placed first at the last \\"Major\\" of the season, the Cowal Gathering. In 2015, the band won the Scottish, British, United Kingdom, European and World Championships, leading to them being awarded the title \\"Champion of Champions\\". Additionally, the Novice, or \\"B\\" band won the British, Scottish and European Championships in 2015, and was crowned \\"Champion of Champions\\" as a result of their success throughout that season. History The memorial to John McNabb, Dollar Academy The Revd Dr Andrew Mylne, First Rector of the Academy Dollar was founded in 1818 after Captain John McNab or McNabb. He captained, owned and leased out many ships over the decades and it is known that at least four voyages transported black slaves to the West Indies in 1789‚Äì91, forty years before the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. McNabb bequeathed part of his fortune ‚Äì ¬£65,000, ‚Äì to provide \\"a charity or school for the poor of the parish of Dollar where I was born\\". McNabb died in 1802 but it took another sixteen years before the school opened it doors after much debate about how to use the bequest. The lands were granted by the local laird, Craufurd Tait of Harviestoun (d.1832). It was in 1815 that the Rev Dr Andrew Mylne DD (1776-1856), minister of Dollar, along with fellow trustees conceived of an academy to educate the boys and girls of the parish, and also pupils from outside Dollar, who would board with teachers. Full fees would be charged to 'non-residenters', while parish pupils would pay fees on a sliding scale, with some receiving free education. To attract pupils from outside the parish, excellent teachers would be appointed. Mylne engaged the architect William Henry Playfair who designed a fitting structure with a splendid Doric fa√ßade. John McNabb's School or Dollar Institution (later Dollar Academy) was finally completed in 1821. In 1818, teaching started, with Rev Andrew Mylne as the first school Rector. The original campus was landscaped into several gardens including two ponds. In the 19th century the school had a strong emphasis on horticulture, and all pupils were allocated plots in the extensive school grounds. Several curious rarities exist in the school grounds in arboricultural terms, including several sequoias. In the 19th century, Dollar pupils sat the Cambridge Examinations or the Indian Civil Service Examinations. John McNabb's coffin was discovered in the early 1930s in the crypt under Old Gravel Lane Meeting House in London. Former pupils had his remains cremated, and the ashes of Captain John McNabb now rest above the Bronze Doors of the school founded in his name. Architecture Main (west) facade of Dollar Academy The library before the fire of 1961 The principal school building was designed by Edinburgh architect William Henry Playfair. The interior originally included stepped seating as might be found in university lecture theatres of the day.Plans of W H Playfair The interior of the Playfair building was gutted by a fire in 1961, but Playfair's Greek-style outer facades remained intact. The interior was rebuilt on a plan based on central corridors with equal sized classrooms on both sides. An extra (second) floor was cleverly concealed, greatly increasing the total available space. The school was re-opened in 1966 by former pupil Lord Heyworth, having been visited by The Queen and Prince Philip in 1963. The assembly hall was rebuilt after the fire. The school library is a \\"whispering gallery\\" because of its domed ceiling. There are numerous other buildings on the campus, including the Dewar Building for science, the Younger Building for mathematics and business studies, the Gibson Building for music, the Iona Building for home economics, the Maguire Building for sport, art and drama and the most recent building the Westwater building . There are also several rugby, cricket and football pitches, and new all-weather surface for hockey and tennis. Sport is supported by the Boys' and Girls' pavilions, the Games Hall and the swimming pool. In 2005, the new Maguire Building was opened with facilities for Art, PE and Drama and with the circular Captain's Room for conferences and meetings. In 2016 the Westwater Building was added, named after Pte George Philip Westwater, an FP killed in the First World War at Gallipoli. This building contains the Modern Languages department and two Economics classrooms.http://www.dollaracademy.org.uk/news/776-the-westwater-building  Boarding houses  The library dome, Dollar Academy Morning Assembly The original boarding accommodation was built at the same time as the original Playfair Building. These houses were situated in Academy Place to accommodate teachers and boarders. Over the years these buildings have been modernised and study bedrooms introduced. The existing boarding houses are all refurbished period buildings. There are spaces for 90 boarders in the Academy's three boarding houses. Both weekly boarders (Monday ‚Äì Friday) and full boarders are accepted. *Argyll House ‚Äì girls aged 10‚Äì18 *Heyworth House ‚Äì girls aged 10‚Äì18 *McNabb‚ÄìTait House ‚Äì boys aged 10‚Äì18 Though the majority of pupils do not board, every pupil belongs to a House. Originally there were five boys' houses, instituted in 1911, hence the term quint. The Quint Cup and House Cup are awarded annually at Prize-Giving. Today there are four quints: =Quints= * Atholl (Red) * Mar (Yellow) * Stewart (Blue) * Argyll (Green) Former pupils' children are traditionally put into the same house as their father, mother, brother, or sister. The names of quints and houses were merged in 2009; previously, male quints followed the names: Castle (Atholl), Devon (Mar), Glen (Stewart), and Hill (Argyll). The fifth male quint was McNabb (purple) but this was dropped in 1937. Traditions The Maguire Building Each year full colours and half colours are awarded to senior pupils for achievement in sporting or cultural pursuits. These awards merit piping on the school blazer (blue for cultural, white for sporting) and/or a distinctive blazer badge. Internationalists' Award ties are presented to pupils, prep, junior and senior, who has represented their country in sporting or cultural activities. Sixth Form pupils are also given a distinctive silver tie, and prefects wear white and blue bands round the blazer sleeves. The senior six (or top six) are the most senior prefects in the school, elected by a ballot of Forms IV, V and VI. Those with the highest numbers of votes are selected for the \\"College of Cardinals\\", who vote among themselves to elect a Head Boy, Head Girl and two deputies for each. Two school songs were composed in 1912, but neither was officially adopted. \\"Here in a Fair Green Valley‚Ä¶\\" by the poet W. K. Holmes and music by Marc Anthony became the official school song sung at prize-giving each year between 1929‚Äì1993. This was then replaced by the Academy Hymn, \\"O God of Bethel!\\" until 2007, when the popularity and metaphorical significance of \\"Will Your Anchor Hold?\\" (Hymn 412) caused it to be adopted for this purpose.

Environmental concerns, nimbyism, and cost reduction were all cited by city officials as reasons for the move. = Demise = In 2015, after 22 years, the celebration was cancelled by event organizers. Rhythm and Booms has since been replaced by a new event, Shake the Lake.  Fireworks  30 minutes of fireworks were launched from Warner park on Madison‚Äôs north side.  Production  The show was owned and operated by a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, Madison Festivals, Inc. Some proceeds from Rhythm & Booms went to local charities, including American Family Children's Hospital.

Many Stellate cells are GABAergic and are located in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Stellate cells are derived from dividing progenitors in the white matter of postnatal cerebellum. Dendritic trees can vary between neurons. There are two types of dendritic trees in the cerebral cortex, which include pyramidal cells, which are pyramid shaped and stellate cells which are star shaped. Dendrites can also aid neuron classification. Dendrites with spines are classified as spiny, those without spines are classified as aspinous. Stellate cells can be spiny or aspinous, while pyramidal cells are always spiny. Most common stellate cells are the inhibitory interneurons found within the upper half of the molecular layer in the cerebellum. Cerebellar stellate cells synapse onto the dendritic arbors of Purkinje cells and send inhibitory signals. Stellate neurons are sometimes found in other locations in the central nervous system; cortical spiny stellate cells are found in layer IVC of the V1 region in the visual cortex. In the somatosensory barrel cortex of mice and rats, glutamatergic (excitatory) spiny stellate cells are organized in the barrels of layer 4. They receive excitatory synaptic fibres from the thalamus and process feed forward excitation to 2/3 layer of V1 visual cortex to pyramidal cells. Cortical spiny stellate cells have a 'regular' firing pattern. Stellate cells are chromophobes, that is cells that does not stain readily, and thus appears relatively pale under the microscope. Cerebellar stellate cells are inhibitory and GABAergic. Stellate and basket cells originate from the cerebellar ventricular zone (CVZ) along with Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia Due to their similarity, basket and stellate cells are grouped together when examined during migration, especially given they follow the same pathway. After mitosis, these cells start in the deep layer of the white matter and migrate up through the internal granular layer (IGL) and purkinje cell layer (PCL) until they reach the molecular layer. During their time in the molecular layer, they change orientation and positioning until they eventually end up in the middle portion of this layer, facing the rostrocaudal direction. Once in this layer, the stellate cells are guided to their correct placement by Bergman glial cells. Aspinous stellate cells are GABAergic cells are found in somatosensory cortex. Apart from visual classification of the aspinous dendrites, they can be immunohistochemically labelled with glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) because of their GABAergic activity, and occasionally colocalize with neuropeptides.

A plumber's snake or drain snake is a slender, flexible auger used to dislodge clogs in plumbing. The plumber's snake is often reserved for difficult clogs that cannot be loosened with a plunger. It is also sometimes called a toilet jack. A plumbers snake is often used by plumbers to clear a clogged drain pipe or sanitary sewer. Auger varieties Plumber's snakes have a coiled (helix- shaped) metal wire with a broader gap between the coils at the terminal end. The operator turns a crank to rotate the helix as it moves through the pipe. If the clog is caused by a dense, but shreddable obstacle, such as tree roots or glass wool, the auger might break it up enough to enable flow. A small, lightweight obstruction might be snagged or corkscrewed by the auger, enabling the operator to pull it away. As the auger rotates, it also flails against the interior walls of the pipe, scraping off minerals and oil. =Hand auger / hand spinner= Hand auger Hand augers are useful for clearing sink and bathtub drains. They are unsuitable for sending through flush toilets, because the wire might damage the bowl; also, flush toilets have relatively large drain pipes in which the narrow snake can become tangled. (A -inch cable, for example, should never be used in a drain with a calibre of more than two inches.) =Closet auger / toilet auger= The closet auger (named after water closet) feeds a relatively short auger through a hook-shaped length of metal tubing. The hook shape makes it easier to feed the auger into the toilet. A plastic boot on the end of the auger protects the finish of the visible porcelain. Since most toilet clogs occur in the trap built into the bowl, the short cable is sufficient to break up or retrieve the greater majority of clogs. =Drum augers= Drum auger A drum auger is a motorized auger with modular blades designed for various gauges of pipe. A drum auger is powerful enough to cut through tree roots. Used unskillfully, they can also damage plastic pipework and even copper tubing. =Roto-Rooter= The Roto-Rooter is an electric auger invented in 1933 by Samuel Blanc, an American. His wife called the invention a Roto-Rooter, because the cable and blades rotated as they cut through tree roots inside sewer pipe. Competing companies made imitations after Blanc's patent expired in 1953, but the machine is manufactured by and for a United States company called the Roto-Rooter Plumbing & Drain Service.

They were first identified as inhibitory by Eccles et al. in 1964. It was also the first example of an inhibitory feed back network, where the inhibitory interneuron was identified anatomically. These cells synapse onto the dendrite of granule cells and unipolar brush cells. They receive excitatory input from mossy fibres, also synapsing on granule cells, and parallel fibers, which are long granule cell axons. Thereby this circuitry allows for feed-forward and feed-back inhibition of granule cells. The main synapse made by these cells is a synapse onto the mossy fibre - granule cell excitatory synapse in a glomerulus. The glomerulus is made up of the mossy fibre terminal, granule cell dendrites, the Golgi terminal and is enclosed by a glial coat. The Golgi cell acts by altering the mossy fibre - granule cell synapse. The Golgi cells use GABA as their transmitter. The basal level of GABA produces a postsynaptic leak conductance by tonically activating alpha 6-containing GABA-A receptors on the granule cell. These high-affinity receptors are located both synaptically and extrasynaptically on the granule cell. The synaptic receptors mediate phasic contraction, duration of around 20-30ms whereas the extrasynapatic receptors mediate tonic inhibition of around 200ms, and are activated by synapse spill over. Additionally the GABA acts on GABA-B receptors which are located presynaptically on the mossy fibre terminal. These inhibit the mossy fibre evoked EPSCs of the granule cell in a temperature and frequency dependent manner. At high mossy firing frequency (10 Hz) there is no effect of GABA acting on presynaptic GABA-B receptors on evoked EPSCs. However, at low (1 Hz) firing the GABA does have an effect on the EPSCs mediated via these presynaptic GABA-B receptors. Type I A Golgi I (or Golgi type I) neuron is a neuron which has a long axon that begins in the grey matter of the central nervous system and may extend from there. It is also known as a projection neuron. They include the neurons forming peripheral nerves and long tracts of brain and spinal cord. Golgi II neurons, in contrast, are defined as having short axons or no axon at all. This distinction was introduced by the pioneering neuroanatomist Camillo Golgi, on the basis of the appearance under a microscope of neurons stained with the Golgi stain that he had invented. Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal postulated that higher developed animals had more Golgi type II in comparison to Golgi type I neurons. These Golgi type 2 neurons have star-like appearance. These Golgi type 2 neurons are found in cerebral and cerebellar cortices and retina. Type II A Golgi II or Golgi type II neuron is a neuron having either no axon or else a short axon that does not send branches out of the gray matter of the central nervous system.

The Giants' telecasts on CSN Bay Area feature Duane Kuiper as play-by-play announcer with Mike Krukow as color analyst. On KNTV telecasts, Miller teams with Krukow for innings 1-3 and 7-9 while Kuiper moves to the radio booth alongside Flemming; the two then switch places for innings 4-6. Through 2010, Miller held a second job as play-by-play announcer for ESPN Sunday Night Baseball, and therefore usually missed weekend Giants games. On these occasions, Greg Papa would take Miller's place on either the television or radio side; however, on weekends when the Giants were featured on Fox television (Saturday) or ESPN (Sunday) and therefore not on local TV, Kuiper and Krukow would join Flemming on the radio, and Miller would generally work the Saturday game if ESPN was in San Francisco that weekend. Since leaving ESPN, Miller also calls select games on CSN Bay Area. On July 14, 2006, for a Friday night home game, Flemming made his television broadcast debut for the Giants. Since then, Flemming and Kuiper have taken turns calling all weekend road games on the radio and on CSN Bay Area (Flemming calling innings 1-3, 7-9, and Kuiper calling innings 4-6 on the radio; and vice versa on TV). However, Flemming solely calls all weekend home games and road games against the Oakland A's on the radio. (It is noted that Miller would fill in for Flemming for Saturday's game only if the Sunday game is on ESPN.) After every game all of the announcers come together on the radio side for the \\"post game (w)rap\\", recapping the game's key plays and selecting players-of-the-game in humorous fashion. Additional broadcasters F.P. Santangelo, now with the Washington Nationals, assisted Flemming on some broadcasts, and retired broadcaster Lon Simmons (died 2015) was usually present several times a season. Since May 2007, and only during weekend home games and road games against the A's, retired Giants first baseman J.T. Snow has performed color analyst duties alongside Flemming. In the 2010 season, Doug Greenwald (son of former Giants broadcaster Hank Greenwald and regular announcer for the AAA (Fresno Grizzlies) called several Giants radio broadcasts as a substitute for Flemming. Former Giants reliever Jeremy Affeldt joined Kuiper for a radio broadcast on September 15, 2016 Spanish-language radio broadcasts are handled by Erwin Higueros, who calls the play-by-play, and Tito Fuentes, who performs color analyst duties. Marvin Benard also serves as a color analyst for road games.  Past broadcasters  Over the years, the Giants have employed numerous other on-air broadcasters, including Hall of Famers Russ Hodges and Lon Simmons, as well as Al Michaels, Hank Greenwald, Ron Fairly, Lindsey Nelson, Ted Robinson, and Joe Angel, among others in English, and Amaury Pi-Gonzalez, in Spanish.

Name The name Belle Poule derives from an incident in 1533. Francis I was presented with the keys of Toulouse by Paule de Viguier, the baroness Fronteville. Paule was a young girl known for her beauty, and Francis nicknamed her la belle Paule. The name became altered over time to belle poule through the difference between French and Occitan pronunciation.Belle poule at esperso-orange The name was later adopted by a Gironde corsair for his vessel, giving rise to it as a ship name in the French navy. Another version of the story is that Francis called her belle poule, as a play on words.

Other phrases which were once used in the early 1800s and have the same meaning were toe the mark and toe the plank.  Origins  Toeing the Line, Byam Shaw The expression has disputed origins, though the two earliest known appearances in print are from the British Army, and the third from the Royal Navy. Those suggested are from public school, the armed services, Bare Knuckle Boxing, or possibly the British House of Commons. =Armed services= In the earliest known appearance of the phrase in print, The Army Regulator, 1738, an officer forming ranks of soldiers says: \\"Silence you dogs, toe the line...\\".https://books.google.ca/books?id=z79lAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PR1&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwihjKWOpvLnAhX3l3IEHRLHAtwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q;=toe The phrase next appeared in 1775's An Easy Plan of Discipline for a Militia, in which parading soldiers are instructed to \\"...bring their toes to the line c g, at the second step they toe the line c h...\\" https://books.google.ca/books?id=iDxYAAAAcAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=An+Easy+Plan+of+Discipline+for+a+Militia&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwinvZfcpvLnAhX_g3IEHWRSDcgQ6AEIKDAA#v=snippet&q;=toe%20the&f;=false The phrase appeared in as a naval term in 1831, describing events of 1803: \\"..on the quarter deck we were arranged in a line, each with his toes at the edge of a plank...\\" to be subjected to \\"scoldings technically called 'toe-the- line' matches.' \\" https://books.google.ca/books?id=BWEYAQAAIAAJ&pg;=PA340&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiR_7HlnfLnAhVqknIEHXIHCOUQ6AEIUTAF#v=onepage&q;=toe The most likely origin of the term goes back to the wooden decked ships of the Royal Navy during the late 17th or early 18th century. Barefooted seamen had to stand at attention for inspection and had to line up on deck along the seams of the wooden planks, hence to \\"toe the line\\". The first mention of this use in literature stems from a story about navy life widely published in 1831 and written by Captain Basil Hall RN.\\"Fragments of Voyages and Travels\\" (reprinted from the London Literary Gazette and written by Captain Basil Hall RN), /The Atheneum - Fourth Series, Volume 1 - April to October 1831, Kane & Co, Boston, page 188 Hall served in the Royal Navy from 1802. On some military parade-grounds there are white lines marked, along which soldiers form up, with their toes just touching the line. =School= It is common practice in many long-established schools for roll-call to be taken twice a day, at which the pupils line up with their toes exactly along a particular line on the floor, while their names are called out for them to respond to, indicating their presence. Reference to toeing the line in schools appeared in 1845: \\"...the class formed themselves, 'toed the line'...‚Äù https://books.google.ca/books?id=iuERAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA685&dq;=%E2%80%8E+the+class+formed+themselves,+toed+the+line,&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiAx9bqsPLnAhWElnIEHcQEDF8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q;=toed&f;=false =House of Commons= It is commonly and erroneously thought that its origins lie in the British House of Commons where sword-strapped members were instructed to stand behind lines that were two sword-lengths apart from their political rivals in order to restore decorum. However, there is no record of a time when Members of Parliament were allowed to bring swords into the Chamber. Historically, only the Serjeant at Arms carries a sword as a symbol of his role in Parliament. There are loops of pink ribbon in the Members' cloakroom for MPs to hang up their swords before entering the Chamber to this very day as a result of this rule. In fact, there were not any lines in the Chamber in the days that gentlemen carried swords.Robert Rogers and Rhodri Walters, How Parliament Works, 6th ed (Longman, 2006), p. 14 and Robert Rogers, Order! Order!: A Parliamentary Miscellany (London: JR Books, 2009), p. 27 =Boundary line= A slightly different use of the term was found in an 1816 magazine, which stated, The Thalweg of the Rhine shall toe the line of separation between France and the German States; ....\\"State of public affairs in December\\", The Monthly magazine, Number 277 Volume 40, R Phillips, 1 Jan 1816, page 548 The meaning in this context was marked the line of separation. An earlier 1813 publication had used the term toe the mark which had the same meaning as toe the line's modern usage, where the author wrote He began to think it was high time to toe the mark.The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan, 1813, by \\"Hector Bull-Us\\" - known to his family and friends as James Paulding An 1828 publication also used toe the plank with a similar meaning.Cogitations; Henry James Finn, Moses Whitney, James William Miller, Oliver C. Wyman; Whimswhams, A K Newman and Co, London, page 155 =Other suggested origins= Over the years the term has been attributed to sports, including toeing the starting line in track events and toeing a center line in boxing, where boxers were instructed to line up on either side of to start a match. However, the earlier boxing term was toeing the scratch, referring to a scratch mark on the floor. One of the earliest references related to an English prize fight in 1840.\\"Fight between Nick Ward and Deaf Burke for ¬£50 a side\\", Editor of Bell's Life in London, Fights for the Championship and other Celebrated Prize Fights, Bell's Life, London, 1855, page 155 Byan Shaw's painting Toeing the Line, depicting a scene at Ascot, alludes to it being a term used in horse racing. =Misspelling as \\"tow the line\\"= \\"Toe the line\\" is often misspelled \\"tow the line\\", substituting a familiar verb \\"tow\\" for the unfamiliar verbal use of \\"toe.\\" \\"Tow\\" does not accord with any of the proposed etymologies, so \\"tow the line\\" is a linguistic eggcorn. Modern usage Its modern-day use includes the context of partisan or factional politics, as in, \\"He's toeing the party line,\\" the context of athletics where it describes runners poised at the starting line, and in the context of behavior where the miscreant is expected to \\"toe the line.\\" The first published use in a political context was in March 1826, where Willie Mangum of the United States House of Representatives proposed that \\"every member might 'toe the mark'.\\"Congress - March 18, 1826, Niles' Weekly Register, H Niles, March to September 1826 Volume VI - Third Series, Baltimore, page 48 The behavioral use also stems from around that time. The term continues to be used in the context of cross-country and track and field running, although sometimes also symbolically in bicycle races to be at your mark along the starting line before a race. Besides its quite literal use in middle and long distance running, the term is still in literal use in the military, particularly the US Army. Some barracks have two solid lines, each approximately three inches wide and placed five feet apart, either taped or painted, running down the center of the entire length of their floor. The soldiers are ordered to \\"toe the line\\". At this command they cease their activities and line up with their toes on the line.A Parallel of Words, Dr Anthony Lightfoot. Authorhouse, 2010, page 457, In the game of darts, many places where it is played have a line marked on the floor that shows the closest point that the player may stand when launching darts at the dartboard.

Analysis This work, which represents three vividly coloured blue horses looking down in front of a landscape of rolling red hills, is characterized by its bright primary colors and a portrayal that simplicity, and a profound sense of emotion. According to the 'Encyclop√¶dia Britannica', \\"the powerfully simplified and rounded outlines of the horses are echoed in the rhythms of the landscape background, uniting both animals and setting into a vigorous and harmonious organic whole.\\".\\"Blue Horses\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2012. Web. (retrieved 18 June 2012) It is thought that the curved lines used to depict the subject are to emphasize \\"a sense of harmony, peace, and balance\\" in a spiritually-pure animal world and that by viewing human beings are allowed to join this harmony.La Cava, Gabi. Review Article: The Expressionist Animal Painter Franz Marc (April 2004) Marc gave an emotional or psychological meaning or purpose to the colors he used in his work: blue was used for masculinity and spirituality, yellow represented feminine joy, and red encased the sound of violence and of base matter. Marc used blue throughout his career to represent spirituality and his use of vivid color is thought to have been an attempt to eschew the material world to evoke a spiritual or transcendental essence.Macke, Wolfgang (ed.) Briefwechsel: August Macke/Franz Marc. (Cologne: DuMont-Schauberg, 1964), 25-28; Partsch, Susanna. Franz Marc 1880-1916. (Cologne: Taschen, 1991), 26.La Cava, Gabi. Review Article: The Expressionist Animal Painter Franz Marc (April 2004)Compare this to Read, Herbert. A Concise History of Modern Painting. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974 ed.) at 193, describing Marc's associate and fellow Blue Reiter member Kandinsky's work of this time as \\"Lines fluctuate and represent not only movement, but purpose and growth. Colours are associative not only in the sense that they express human emotion (joy or sadness, etc.) but also in that they signify emotive aspects of our external environment-yellow is earthy, blue is heavenly; yellow is brash and importunate, and upsets people, blue is pure and infinite, suggestive of infinite peace.\\" This oil painting on canvas measures 41.625 inches by 71.3125 inches (unframed) and is unsigned. This is one of Marc's earliest major works depicting animals and the more important of his series of portraits of horses in various colors. It is often thought that Marc thought animals to be more pure and more beautiful than man and represented a more pantheistic understanding of the divine or of spirituality.Wankheit, Klaus and Steffen, Uwe.

Rationales \\"Suing for\\", in this older sense of the phrase, means \\"pleading or petitioning for\\". Suing for peace is usually initiated by the losing party in an attempt to stave off an unconditional surrender and may sometimes be favorable to the winning nation, as prosecuting a war to a complete victory may be costly. In this case, then, the word \\"sue\\" is being used in its original meaning of \\"to make petition to or for\\", rather than the usual meaning of \\"to take legal action against\\". Pressing for peace may sometimes, however, be started by the winning faction as a means to end the war for several reasons, such as where additional conflict would not be in the perceived best interest of the winning party. In this case, demands might be made, or the two nations may agree to a \\"white peace\\", or status quo ante bellum. Examples The First Sino-Japanese War (1 August 1894 ‚Äì 17 April 1895) was fought between the Qing Empire of China and the Empire of Japan, primarily over influence of Korea. After more than six months of unbroken successes by Japanese land and naval forces and the loss of the Chinese port of Weihaiwei, the Qing government sued for peace in February 1895. The archives abound with attempts to halt World War I, but most attempts were unofficial and of no effect. On 2 December 1916, prior to his coronation later that month, Charles I of Austria took over the title of Supreme Commander of the army from Archduke Frederick. In 1917, he secretly entered into peace negotiations with France. He employed his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary. The negotiations of the Sixtus Affair for a sued peace failed.

Approximately 130 km south of the city of Bahawalpur, the forty bastions of Derawar are visible for many miles in the Cholistan Desert. The walls have a perimeter of 1500 metres and stand up to thirty metres high. Derawar fort was first built in the 9th century AD by Rai Jajja Bhutta, a Hindu ruler of the Bhutta clan, as a tribute to Rawal Deoraj Bhati the king of Jaisalmer and Bahawalpur.Dawn News The fort was initially known as Dera Rawal, and later referred to as Dera Rawar, which with the passage of time came to be pronounced Derawar, its present name. In the 18th century, the fort was taken over by Muslim Nawabs of Bahawalpur from the Shahotra tribe. It was later rebuilt in its current form in 1732 by the Abbasi ruler Nawab Sadeq Muhammad, but in 1747 the fort slipped from their hands owing to Bahawal Khan's preoccupations at Shikarpur. Nawab Mubarak Khan took the stronghold back in 1804. 1,000 year-old catapult shells were found in the debris near a decaying wall in the fort. Nawab Sadeq Muhammad Khan Abbasi V, the 12th and last ruler of Bahawalpur state, was born in the fort in 1904. This historically significant fort presents an enormous and impressive structure in the heart of the Cholistan desert, but it is rapidly deteriorating and in need of immediate preventive measures for preservation.

That may be due to speech pathology but also occurs when the sinuses are blocked from a common cold, when it is called a nasal voice, which is not a linguistic term. The symbol in the Extended IPA is . When one speaks with a cold, the nasal passages still function as a resonant cavity so a denasalized nasal does not sound like a voiced oral stop , and a denasalized vowel does not sound like an oral vowel . However, there are cases of historical or allophonic denasalization that have produced oral stops. In some languages with nasal vowels, such as Paicƒ©, nasal consonants may occur only before nasal vowels; before oral vowels, prenasalized stops are found. That allophonic variation is likely to be from a historical process of partial denasalization. Similarly, several languages around Puget Sound underwent a process of denasalization about 100 years ago. Except in special speech registers, such as baby talk, the nasals became the voiced stops . It appears from historical records that there was an intermediate stage in which the stops were prenasalized stops or poststopped nasals .

Gillis (born December 19, 1952) is an American comic book writer best known for his work at Marvel Comics and First Comics in the mid-1980s, including the series Strikeforce: Morituri and the digitally drawn comic series Shatter. Biography Peter B. Gillis' first work in the comics industry was as a freelance writer for Marvel Comics. His first published comics story was \\"Saturday Night Furor\\" in Captain America #224 (Aug. 1978). and He then wrote various issues of Marvel Two-In-One, What If...?, and Super-Villain Team-Up from 1978 to 1980. The irregular publishing frequency of the final issues of Super-Villain Team-Up was due to a legal maneuver to prevent DC Comics from trademarking the term \\"supervillain\\". Gillis then worked as an editor for the Florida-based publisher New Media Publishing; he left that position in June 1981. He is best known for the digital comic Shatter (1985‚Äì1988) and First Comics' Warp (1983‚Äì1985). Gillis co-created Strikeforce: Morituri (1986‚Äì1988) with artist Brent Anderson. Gillis wrote the entire runs of Micronauts: The New Voyages (1984‚Äì1986) and Strange Tales vol. 2 (1987‚Äì1988); other Marvel work included numerous issues of What If (1980‚Äì1984), The Defenders (1984‚Äì1986), The Eternals vol. 2 (1985‚Äì1986), Doctor Strange vol. 2 #76‚Äì81 (1986‚Äì1987) and Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #1‚Äì4 (1988‚Äì1989). The Defenders was Gillis's first ongoing assignment; he recounted, \\"I had been working for a while at Marvel, and was constantly pumping for more work, and specifically a series of my own. So when I heard DeMatteis was leaving Defenders, I was in [editor] Carl Potts' office like a shot, and I got the gig.\\" His creations for other companies include Blaze Barlow and the Eternity Command and the Black Flame for First Comics; and Gammarauders, a tie-in to the Gamma World role-playing game, for DC Comics' short-lived TSR Games line. He also wrote the science-fiction miniseries Tailgunner Jo with art by Tom Artis for DC. Gillis returned to comics in 2010 when he wrote the six-issue comic adaptation of Peter S. Beagle's The Last Unicorn for IDW Publishing.

The game, which serves as a sequel to Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX, was released on August 13, 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. A Game Boy Advance port was developed by HotGen and released the same day as the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions. A GameCube port was developed by Gratuitous Games and was released on October 8, 2002. Gameplay Like its predecessor, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 uses the basic game structure carried over from Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series of video games. The goal of the game is to successfully perform and combine different tricks on a BMX bike, with successful executions adding to the player's score. The point value of the trick is based on time maintained, degrees rotated, number of tricks performed in sequence, and the number of times the tricks have been used (the more often a trick is used, the less it's worth). Successful tricks also add to the player's special meter, which, once full, allows for the execution of \\"signature moves\\" which are worth more than normal tricks. Grinds, lip tricks, and manuals (wheelies) are included in the game to help the player link tricks together into combos. Bails (falling off the bike due to poor landing) cause for no points to be awarded for the attempted trick or combo, and resets the special bar to empty. Enhancements over the previous installment include improved graphics, new tricks (including flatland tricks and a \\"trick tweaking system,\\" similar to the trick modifier featured in Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX), a balance meter for grind and lip tricks, more riders, a longer career mode, a larger soundtrack, and larger, more interactive environments. The player can choose from eleven different professional BMX riders, with each rider having their own unique stats, bikes, and trick sets. Eight levels are included in the game, set in and around various cities across the United States. The Xbox version features a total of twelve professional BMX riders and nine levels: rider Chad Kagy and the London level are exclusive to this release. =Game modes= Road Trip ‚Äî \\"Road Trip\\" is the equivalent to the previous game's \\"Career Mode.\\" In this mode, the player has to complete different tasks (such as getting a high score or collecting items) in an attempt to earn points and advance to new levels. Each level has twelve goals to complete (as opposed to five in the first game), broken up into three categories based on difficulty. Only four goals are available at one time, which must be completed before unlocking the next set of challenges. Advancing in this mode allows the player to unlock new levels, bikes, riders, and songs from the game's soundtrack. Videos are also unlocked which includes over 90 minutes of footage from a real BMX tour featuring the pros, which promoted the game. Session ‚Äî In this mode, the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, an available level, and rides for a one to five- minute session in an attempt to set a high score. Free Ride ‚Äî Free Ride is similar to the Session mode; the player chooses a BMX rider, an available bike, and an available level. Instead of a timed session, however, there is no time limit, allowing the player to practice or simply explore, searching for gaps and secrets areas. Tiki Battle ‚Äî After completing the Road Trip mode, a bonus game is unlocked, called the \\"Tiki Battle,\\" which acts as a first person shooter. The player attempts to defeat a large animated statue located in the Hawaii level of the game, collecting ammunition and health bonuses while avoiding fireballs thrown at the player. When this challenge is completed, a special character is unlocked and the \\"Tiki Battle\\" becomes available in the main menu of the game. Multiplayer modes ‚Äî The game features several new and returning multi-player modes including Horse, Trick Attack, Graffiti, Tag, and Push. Course Editor ‚Äî This mode allows the player to create their own level by arranging various ramps, rails, and other pieces. Gaps can be created and named, and the player's starting positions can also be chosen by the player. Once a created park is finished, the level can be accessed in the game's \\"Session\\", \\"Free Ride\\", and multiplayer modes. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms except the GameCube version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, where the PlayStation 2 version was ported and published by Capcom on May 27, 2004, Famitsu gave it a score of one six, two fives, and one six for a total of 22 out of 40.

The Hall was built around 1580, probably on the site of an earlier 12th-century medieval manor and manor house. During the Civil War it was garrisoned, and was a site of several skirmishes. The garden is largely the product of two tenants. George Maw (1832‚Äì1912), local pottery manufacturer and crocus enthusiast developed the garden from around 1865 onwards. Subsequently, the Victorian era Romantic painter and sculptor Robert Bateman (1842‚Äì1922), who was the son of a famous horticulturalist, added the rockeries and terraces of the current garden. The Restoration era church of St. Bartholomew, built 1667-68, stands close by the Hall. The Shropshire Way, a waymarked long- distance footpath, passes through the extensive woodland that lies to the north, between the estate and the River Severn. In Enola Holmes, Benthall Hall was used for the exterior shots of the Holmes' family estate.

Many variations of the recipe exist. They generally include liberal quantities of boiled potatoes, butter and salt. Potato scones are traditionally made as circles about 6 inches (15 cm) across and then cut into quarters, or farls. They may also be baked in small rounds.F. Marian McNiell; \\"The Scots Kitchen\\"; Birlinn; ; p.231 They are generally unleavened and are thinner, 3 mm or so, than what is usually considered a scone. They are often served as part of the full Scottish breakfast with fried eggs, bacon and lorne sausage. Alternatively, they are often eaten in a roll, usually accompanied with either lorne sausage, bacon, or fried egg. They can also be eaten like a wheat scone with jam and a cup of strong tea. A typical potato scone is made with mashed potato (potato and butter‚Äîno milk is used‚Äîwith salt to taste) and plain flour is added to make it into a dough which is then rolled out and put on a griddle to cook. They are traditionally served hot, and cold potato scones are often reheated by toasting or frying. Potato scones contain a small proportion of flour to a large proportion of potatoes: one traditional recipe calls for two ounces of flour and half an ounce of butter to a pound of potatoes.F.

The population in 2011 was 782,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 88.29 km¬≤. History The Megalithic monuments of the Cromlech of Xerez Due to its geographic position, the hilltop of Monsaraz always occupied an important place in the history of the municipality, having been occupied by different peoples since the pre- historical record. It is one of the oldest Portuguese settlements of the southern Portugal, occupied since pre-history, whose examples of permanent habitation include hundreds of megalithic monuments. These include the neolithic remains of: Megalithic Monuments of Herdade de Xerez, Olival da Pega Dolmens, Menhir of Bulhoa, Rocha dos Namorados Menhir and Outeiro Menhir. The hill, on which the main settlement is located, was a pre-historic fortification, or castro, that was the basis of pre-Roman occupation and funerary temples, carved from the local rock. Monsaraz was reorganized during the Roman occupation, and was later successively occupied by the Visigoths, Arabs, Mozarabs, Jews, and, after the Reconquista, Christians loyal to Afonso Henriques. In the 8th century, Monsaraz fell under the dominion of Arab forces who occupied the Iberian Peninsula, becoming known as Saris or Sharish, and following the control of the Taifa of Badajoz (one of the more prominent Arab centres at the time). The name Monsaraz originates from the word Xarez or Xerez, the Iberian transliteration of the Arabic Saris or Sharish, for the Gum Rockrose (Cistus ladanifer L.), a plant that still today prospers in poor, dry, acidic slate-based soil that surrounds Monsaraz. The Iberian words Xarez/Xerez latter evolved to the Portuguese Xaraz and to the Spanish (Castilian) Jerez (the Spanish name for the sherry wine). The settlement therefore came to be known as Monsaraz, originating from Monte Xaraz, i.e., fortified hill surrounded by Gum Rockroses. Its naturally prominent position, being the highest hill in the area as well as its proximity to the deep Guadiana valley, made it a location of strategic importance. The Castle keep of Monsaraz, centre of tourism in the parish In 1167, the Castle and medina was taken by Geraldo Sem Pavor, in an expedition that came from √âvora (which had just been retaken, about the same time). After, Afonso Henriques' defeat in Badajoz, Monsaraz was once again taken by Muslim forces. In 1232, supported by the Knights Templar, King Sancho II definitively retook the citadel and town, placing it under the control of the Templars, and obligating them to establish a garrison that would protect the border. The Christian repopulation of Monsaraz ended around the reign of Afonso III, when it was assigned an alcalde, the knight Martim Anes, and first letter of foral. In 1263 it was already an important fortress, being the head of a municipality, with large privileges. The local economy was fundamentally based on agriculture and livestock, existing some small artesnal industries producing terra cotta earthenware and hammered copper. After the Portuguese Interregnum (1383-1385), the town of Monsaraz was integrated into the dominions of the House of Braganza under Nuno √Ålvares Pereira. By 1412, it is inherited by Fernando, his son, becoming one of the more precious profit centres in the Ducal estates. In 1512, King Manuel of Portugal issued a foral (charter) to the Vila de Monsaraz, reformulating the public and jurisdictional administration of the municipality. The demographic crises created by the plague forced the Duke of Bragan√ßa, in 1527 to carry out small land reforms in order to promote the settlement Monsaraz. The small plots were established in the area surrounding this village. Following the Portuguese Restoration War, in 1640, the castle received new tactical defenses, that included a new walled bastion, that allowed the city-fort to be integrated into the system of defences that connected Elvas, Juromenha, Oliven√ßa and Mour√£o. View from Monsaraz, Portugal The condition of the walled medieval city, the growth of the farm estates of Reguengos, the richness of the artesnal production and vineyards, and more importantly, the loyalty towards the Miguelist forces during the Liberal Wars were all factors that contributed to the shifting of the municipal seat from Monsaraz to Vila Nova de Reguengos in 1838, a fact that became permanent after 1851. Geography The parish of Monsaraz is located in the northeast corner of the municipality of Reguengos de Monsaraz fronting the Guadiana River and Alqueva Dam to the east, Corval to the west and Campinho to the south in the municipality of Reguengos de Monsaraz. Across the reservoir to the east is the parish of Mour√£o (in the municipality of Mour√£o) and to the north the parish of Capelins (in the municipality of Alandroal).

She was born Janet Monach Whytock in London in 1842. She had a fine alto voice, which developed into a contralto, and she studied singing under John Wass, Ciro Pinsuti and Emma Lucombe (wife of Sims Reeves). Whytock's first appearance, in 1860, was made at Birmingham under the name Ellen Andrews. Her first regular engagement was in 1865, in the provinces. From 1866, in which year she sang at the Worcester Festival, and married John Patey, a bass singer, she was recognized as one of the leading contraltos; and on the retirement of Helen Sainton-Dolby in 1870 Patey was without a rival whether in oratorio or in ballad music. She toured in America in 1871, sang in Paris in 1875, Australia in 1890, and New Zealand in 1891. She died at Sheffield on 28 February 1894 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

He has written ten novels. He is best known for his 1992 novel Jumper, which was adapted into a film released in 2008. Biography Steven Charles Gould was born in Fort Huachuca, Arizona on February 7, 1955, to James Alan and Carita Louise Gould. His father was an Army officer; when Gould was in junior high his father was stationed at Fort Shafter in Hawaii for three years. The whole family learned to scuba dive there and Gould went diving frequently. Gould attended Texas A&M; University and has set much of his writing in Texas. Aggiecon, which is held in College Station on the Texas A&M; campus, was the first science fiction convention Gould attended, and he was chair of Aggiecon V in 1975. Gould submitted the first short story he wrote to Analog; it was rejected with a personal note from then-editor Ben Bova, who encouraged Gould to let him see his future work. The second story Gould wrote, \\"The Touch of Their Eyes,\\" was read aloud by Theodore Sturgeon at a writing workshop at AggieCon in 1979. Sturgeon made one correction (\\"Calvary and Cavalry are two different things\\") and suggested that Gould submit it to Stan Schmidt, who had become editor at Analog in late 1978. Gould did, and the story was published by Analog in 1980. Gould was director of the south/central region of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) from 1986‚Äì1989. He was also a guest lecturer at Texas A&M; in 1990. Gould was president of SFWA for two years through June 2015. Gould practices and teaches aikido, which is featured prominently in his books 7th Sigma and Helm. The young protagonists of both books become proficient at the martial art and eventually embrace it as a full lifestyle. His scuba diving hobby informed scenes in his novels Greenwar and Blind Waves.\\"Green Dreams, with Explosions\\"; interview of Laura J. Mixon and Steven Gould by Jayme Lynn Blaschke. Interzone 160 (October 2000). Greenwar was a collaboration with his wife, Laura J. Mixon. Writing workshops Gould has been an instructor at the annual one- week speculative fiction workshop Viable Paradise since 2000. Personal life In 1989 Gould married Laura J. Mixon and moved with her to New York City, where her job supported them while he finished his first novel, Jumper. The couple currently live in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They have two daughters.

Hudgens and co-written by Hudgens, Denny Humbard, and Men in Black creator Lowell Cunningham. Made for around $1000, it is a spoof of Star Wars and The Apprentice, with Emperor Palpatine filling the Donald Trump role in his search for a new apprentice. The final candidates in the film are Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Count Dooku, and Jar Jar Binks. While the film primarily spoofs the Star Wars universe in the format of The Apprentice, there are several other notable targets, including swipes at The Princess Bride, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Dracula, and The Lord of the Rings. In the film's standout sequence, Darth Vader takes to the stage, dancing Riverdance-style with a squad of stormtroopers. At one point in the film, Vader cuts off Dooku's head and hands in a scene staged similarly to one in Revenge of the Sith where Anakin, not yet Vader, cuts off Dooku's hands and then proceeds to cut off his head. However, Sith Apprentice was written and filmed months before Revenge of the Sith premiered. The film has proven popular with Star Wars fans, and won the Audience Choice Award in the Lucasfilm-sponsored 2005 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards. In August 2010, Time magazine listed it as one of the Top 10 Star Wars fanfilms. Cast * Robert Alley ... Darth Sidious * Robert E. Bean ... Darth Vader * Kristen Caron ...

In 1982, he became the national champion of Sweden, and went on to finish fourth overall at the first official Rubik's Cube World Championships held in Budapest, Hungary. He later published his method, known as the Petrus system, on the Internet. It became a fairly popular method among intermediate and upper-level speedcubers, although its more recent use has diminished considerably due to the increased predominance of methods such as ZZ, Roux, and CFOP. Petrus won the 3x3x3 Fewest Moves category at the 2005 World Championships held in November 2005 at Lake Buena Vista, Florida, USA claiming the US$500 prize. He currently (since 1995) resides in SF Bay Area, California, USA. The Lars Petrus System The Petrus System was designed as an alternative to the popular layer-based solutions of the early 1980s. Petrus reasoned that as a solver constructs layers, further organization of the cube's remaining pieces is restricted by what one has already done. In order for a layer-based solution to continue after the first layer had been constructed, the solved portion of the cube would have to be temporarily disassembled while the desired moves were made, then reassembled afterward. Petrus sought to get around this quagmire by solving the cube outwards from one corner, leaving him with unrestricted movement on several sides of the cube as he progressed. This method is often used to solve the cube in a fewest-moves solution. =The Method= The system uses seven basic steps to solve a Rubik's Cube. # Build a 2x2x2 block # Expand to a 2x2x3 without destroying the 2x2x2 block # Correct edge orientation # Solve two complete layers # Permute the remaining corners # Orient the remaining corners # Permute the final edges Petrus invented three simple and flexible algorithms to complete the last three steps, which he named Niklas, Sune, and Allan. While the method stands alone as an efficient system for solving the Rubik's Cube, many modifications have been made over the years to stay on the cutting edge of competitive speedcubing. Many more algorithms have been added to shave seconds off the solution time, and steps 5+6 or 6+7 are often combined depending on the problems each case presents.

Although the album was completed in the summer of 1984, it was not released until 1985 due to issues with Exodus and their record label. It is considered one of the most influential thrash metal albums of all time. It is also the only full-length studio album of Exodus to feature Paul Baloff on vocals, though he was also on their 1982 Demo. Baloff was back in Exodus for five years (from 1997 to his death in 2002), and appeared on their 1997 live album Another Lesson in Violence. In 2008, Exodus re-recorded Bonded by Blood and re-released it as Let There Be Blood, featuring a new line-up of members aside from drummer Tom Hunting and guitarist Gary Holt who played on the original. Album information Bonded by Blood was originally titled A Lesson in Violence, but had its name changed when a suitable cover idea could not be found. An advance cassette copy of the album (with the original title) was widely distributed through the tape-trading network upon the record's completion late in the summer of 1984, creating an immense underground buzz prior to the official release of the LP. The release was delayed, however, due to problems with the artwork. The song \\"Impaler\\" was originally to be featured on Bonded by Blood, but it was abandoned when Kirk Hammett took the main riff with him to Metallica (it was used on \\"Trapped Under Ice\\"). Album cover The original album cover art was an illustration of good and evil conjoined twin infants. For the 1989 reissue this cover was replaced with the band logo on a red and black image of a crowd. The album was remastered and re-issued by Century Media in 1999 in Europe only, with two live tracks from its Combat re- release in 1989, featuring Steve Souza on vocals. This reissue from Century Media restored the original twin cover artwork. Reception and legacy Bonded by Blood received a positive review from Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic, who states: \\"Had it been released immediately after it was recorded in 1984, Exodus' Bonded by Blood might be regarded today alongside Metallica's Kill 'Em All as one of the landmark albums responsible for launching the thrash metal wave\\" and adds that \\"Exodus were left to wonder what kind of impact they may have had without these setbacks.\\" Rivadavia also described Bonded by Blood as \\"an album whose influence far exceeds its actual notoriety, and it remains a crucial piece of the thrash metal puzzle ‚Äì essential.\\" Bernard Doe of Metal Forces in 1985 defined it \\"a classic album in the thrash metal sense which is sure to be sneered at by the unconverted and mainstream media.\\" In 2013, Bonded by Blood was ranked number 80 on Metalrules.com's 'Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums'. In August 2014, Revolver placed the album on its \\"14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own\\" list. The album was ranked number one on Loudwire's top ten list of \\"Thrash Albums NOT Released by the Big 4\\". In 2017, Rolling Stone ranked Bonded by Blood as 45th on their list of \\"The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\\". Thrash metal revival act Bonded by Blood named themselves after the album.

Publication history Created by Jack Kirby, Kro first appeared in Eternals vol. 1 #1 (July, 1976). The character subsequently appeared in Eternals #3 (September 1976), Iron Man Annual #6 (1983), Eternals Vol. 2 #5-6 (February‚ÄìMarch 1986), #8 (May 1986), Quasar #12 (July 1990), Eternals: The Herod Factor #1 (November 1991), The Avengers #370-371 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1994), Fantastic Four Unlimited #10 (July 1995), The Avengers Vol. 2 #45 (October 2001), #49 (February 2002), and Eternals Vol. 3 #2-3 (September‚ÄìOctober 2006). Kro received an entry in the original Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #6 and in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #7, and the All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #3 (2007). Fictional character biography In the Marvel Universe, Kro is the leader of the Deviant race, an evolutionary offshoot of the human race created by the Celestials. He is one of the first Earth Deviants created. Besides being a shapeshifter, he is immortal. He hides this from his fellow Deviants by pretending to be a long line of fathers/sons. Also hidden from the Deviants is his long-standing (20,000 years) on-off relationship with Thena, leader of the Eternals and mother of their twin children, Donald & Deborah Ritter. This relationship unravels during the course of the story. In the past, Kro has disguised himself as the Devil in order to try to influence or frighten humans. His control over his own molecules renders him immune to the genetic manipulations of Ghaur. After the death of Brother Tode, Kro became a figurehead monarch for the Deviants and have a power struggle with Priestlord Ghaur. After the disintegration of Ghaur, Kro remained as unique leader of the Deviants.Eternals 1985-1986 miniseries - Vol. 2 #2 However he becomes depressed and adbicated the throne to search Thena again.

Ghaur won when he promised the deviants the return of the fertility with the help of the kidnapped eternal Phastos. The Asgardian god Thor rescued Phastos and battled Ghaur. Kro approached Ereshkigal and activated the Asgardian Unbiding stone, but it got out of control, threatening all reality . When Thor destroyed the stone, Ghaur and Ereshkigal disappeared and Kro was left leading the Deviants.Thor: the Deviants Saga Vol. 1 #1-5 (2012). Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Despite his Deviant heritage, Kro possesses a number of superhuman traits characteristic of an Eternal. Kro maintains a virtually unbreakable mental control over the processes and structure of his body even when he is asleep or unconscious. As a result, Kro has a lifespan that has already lasted over 20,000 years and is immune to disease and aging. His mental control over his body enables him to maintain a youthful, vigorous physical condition. Kro is not as nearly indestructible as the Eternals. (For example, Ikaris nearly killed Kro once by strangulation.) But while sufficient force can kill Kro, he can use his mental control over his body to heal himself after being injured. Kro also possesses the power of physical malleability, which is atypical for a Deviant. At will he can cause most of the tissue of his body to become pliant, enabling him to shape it mentally like putty into different configurations. Once the tissue is set in an altered form, Kro has only to stop concentrating and his body will retain that shape until such time as he concentrates upon changing it again. This ability enables him to disguise himself and take the appearance of others (with cosmetic help for skin color, body hair, and so forth). One of Kro's favorite ploys is to pass himself off among ordinary humanity as a demon by fashioning horns on his head. However, Kro's shape- changing powers are limited. He cannot alter the shape of his skeleton in more than minor ways. Moreover, he cannot eliminate any of his mass while transforming; he can only redistribute his 320 pounds of weight. Hence, he usually only uses his shape-changing power to alter his facial features. He can mentally mold the shape of his skull somewhat. Kro has about three times the physical endurance of an ordinary human athlete. His heart is not located in the same place as an ordinary human being's; its true location is unrevealed.

The town is close to the mouth of the River Dwyryd on the A487 nearly east of , and had a population of 2,150 at the 2011 census, increased from 2,031 in 2001. The community includes Minffordd and Portmeirion. History An older settlement of a few cottages at Upper Penrhyn was originally called Cefn Coch ('Red Ridge') and that name is perpetuated by the Penrhyndeudraeth primary school, which is known as Ysgol Cefn Coch; but the town proper is comparatively modern. The ground on which it stands was a malarial swamp encircling a huge stagnant pool. The present town owes its existence as a commercial centre to a local landowner, David Williams of Castell Deudraeth near Minffordd, who in the mid-19th century drained the swamp and dried the pool and constructed many streets. Adopting a scheme of town planning evolved by the builder of Tremadog and his Italian craftsmen, Williams gave Penrhyndeudraeth broad streets and wide open spaces. The main square is a road junction with choice of four roads - one leading to the station, one to Porthmadog, one to Maentwrog and the other to Llanfrothen and the Pass of Aberglaslyn. Williams' daughter Alice Williams built the first Institute Hall for one of the first British Women's Institutes in the country in Penrhyndeudraeth. The lower half of Penrhyndeudraeth used to be a lake, which was then drained to create the area where the village's High Street is today. The names of terraces in Penrhyndeudraeth, such as Glanllyn (\\"lakeside\\") and Penllyn (\\"end of the lake\\"), refer to a time when the site was underwater. There is also an area named Penlan ('the end of the tide'), which may point to the reason why the lower half of Penrhyndeudraeth is flat. It is believed that the lower half of Penrhyndeudraeth was founded on a spot behind the Royal Oak pub where the old Pierce & Sons garage is located. Prior to the many 19th century land reclamation projects (including The Cob at Porthmadog) and the building of the Ffestiniog Railway, both of which spurred economic growth, the few local inhabitants relied on agriculture and small-scale copper mining. Some men worked boats on the River Dwyryd, carrying slate from Maentwrog to the sea for export. Local women at that time gathered cockles in the estuary for sale in local markets. Penrhyndeudraeth is still known locally, especially by the people of Blaenau Ffestiniog and Porthmadog, as Penrhyn Cocos (or \\"Cockletown\\" in English). Halfway between Penrhyndeudraeth and Minffordd, next to the Snowdonia National Park Headquarters, but standing apart, is Hendre Hall, where in 1648 Humphrey Humphreys was born. He became Bishop of Bangor from 1689 to 1701 and then of Hereford. He died in 1712. One of the family carvings at the Holy Trinity Church Penrhyndeudraeth is of him and there is also an oak chest which Richard Humphreys gave to Llanfrothen Church whilst working as its warden in 1690. The property named \\"Cae Ednyfed\\", between Penrhyndeudraeth and Minffordd, was once the property of Ednyfed Fychan, commander-in-chief to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. The town has not always been very religious. Early in the history of the Methodists, they established chapels, and fellowship meetings (seiadau) were established. There is a history of revivalists such as Daniel Rowland who held meetings at Tyddyn Isaf and the poet Dafydd Si√¥n Si√¢ms who publicly cursed the new religion before himself being converted. He chastised the Methodists mercilessly before burning all their critical poetic works in a public bonfire in the village square. The Old Methodists' original communion chalice is to be seen in the National Library in Aberystwyth. The town was originally in two Anglican parishes, Llanfrothen and Llandecwyn. Holy Trinity church was built in 1858 and a new parish of Penrhyndeudraeth was created in 1897. For 130 years, the explosives works were the economic backbone of the town. Historically, the population depended on employment offered by the slate industry at Blaenau Ffestiniog and the trade in raw materials through the busy harbour at Porthmadog. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward extends north to Llanfrothen with a total population of 2,587. IndustryExplosives= The first explosives factory in Penrhyndeudraeth was established in 1865 as the Patent Safety Guncotton Company. It was licensed in 1875 and became part of the New Explosives Company, manufacturing explosives from guncotton, starch and India rubber. By 1908 it was the Steelite Explosives Company Ltd.http://www.heneb.co.uk/ww1/cookes.html In 1915, the vast majority of the then factory was destroyed by an explosion. Along with this accident and another at Nobel‚Äôs Explosives in Scotland, Britain faced fighting the First World War with a shortage of much needed munitions. The then newly appointed Minister for Munitions, David Lloyd George, ordered a Government requisition of the factory, which led to it being rebuilt to produce munitions and was known as HM Factory Penrhyndeudraeth, employing 349 workers. Following the end of the First World War, production continued at the factory, but in 1921, it was closed and put up for sale. This was merely just the beginning and not the end for the factory however. Durham born businessman, R.T. Cooke, who had coal mining interests in the north-east of England and was also the majority shareholder of the Essex based Miner‚Äôs Safety Explosives Company was keen to capitalise on growing demand for explosives in the mining industry and wanted to start production of the much safer Nitroglycerine. This however was found to be impossible at his site in Stanford le Hope due to the factory being too close to a Shell petrol refinery. Cooke knew he‚Äôd need to locate a new factory if his venture was to succeed. On his train journey back from Essex to Durham, Cooke came across a newspaper advertisement listing government owned factories that were up for sale following the war. HM Factory Penrhyndeudraeth drew his eye immediately and Cooke decided to visit the site and found it was perfect for the production of Nitroglycerin due to it being located in a series of valleys. In 1922, the production of explosives restarted in Penrhyndeudraeth and became known as Cooke‚Äôs Explosives Limited. Such was the site‚Äôs success, R.T. Cooke expanded the factory and subsequently decided to move the Miner‚Äôs Safety Explosives Company from Essex, to Penrhyndeudraeth. In 1927, the factory in Penrhyndeudraeth suffered another explosion, destroying the whole southern section of the site, which saw it unable to produce Nitroglycerin. Facing the potential failure of his business being unable to fulfil orders, R.T. Cooke had no option but to seek the assistance of his then rivals, who were the only other producers of Nitroglycerin, the newly formed industrial giant, Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). ICI agreed to fulfil Cooke‚Äôs Nitroglycerine orders whilst the factory in Penrhyndeudraeth was rebuilt, on the condition that they could buy a majority stake in Cooke‚Äôs Explosives Company. Cooke agreed and was allowed to stay on at the company as a Managing Director. The outbreak of the Second World War ensured that Cooke‚Äôs explosives company was once again at the forefront of the war effort, producing an estimated 17 million hand grenades between 1939 and 1945. Following the war, the factory returned to producing Nitroglycerine once again, employing over 300 people. 1957 saw the site‚Äôs third serious accident since its inception, leading to further damage to its production facilities. In 1958, R.T. Cooke retired and ICI bought the remaining shares in Cooke‚Äôs Explosives Company, now making it a fully owned ICI subsidiary within the ICI Explosives division known as Nobel‚Äôs Explosives Company Ltd which also had an extensive production site in Ardeer, Ayrshire. Although now a part of ICI, the factory was still known as ‚ÄúCooke‚Äôs Works‚Äù. The Cooke name lives on in Penrhyndeudraeth, as the name of a small industrial estate on part of the former factory site. ICI‚Äôs priority following its full acquisition of Cooke‚Äôs Explosives was to introduce safer methods of working and heavily investing in modern technology, leading to some automation and remote control of production processes, with the aim of preventing another catastrophic accident that had blighted the factory over the decades. This unprecedented level of investment in the factory led it to be the world‚Äôs most advanced nitroglycerin factories. Its success saw ICI relocate its nitroglycerin production from its site in Ardeer, Scotland and base it exclusively at Penrhyndeudraeth. By the 1970s the factory in Penrhyndeudraeth supplied 90% of the explosives for the British coal industry in the form of nitroglycerine-based explosive products. The prolonged miners' strike of 1984 and the competition from foreign coal imports resulted in wholesale pit closures which, in turn, reduced the demand for mining explosives to the point where production was no longer economic and the site was finally closed in 1995 and cleared in 1997, bringing nearly 130 years of explosives production at the site to an end. The site is now in the hands of the North Wales Wildlife Trust as a nature reserve notable for the presence in summer of nightjars. The nature reserve is officially known as ‚ÄúGwaith Powdwr‚Äù (Powder Works) a befitting homage to its explosive industrial past, ensuring its continued place firmly in the history books. Many lives were lost in accidents at the works, and there is a slate plaque at the top of the factory site known locally as ‚ÄúKlondike‚Äù to commemorate them and everyone who worked there. =Granite= Another 19th-century industry in the district is Garth Quarry at Minffordd, established in 1870 to make granite setts for road building in towns and cities. Like the explosives industry, the quarry relied heavily on the coming of the Cambrian Railways in 1872. The quarry is still operational, and owned by Breedon Group, producing roadstone and railway ballast. Transport The town is at the junction of the A487 with the A4085 which connects with Beddgelert and Caernarfon. The first section of this road is very narrow and rises steeply through Upper Penrhyn. In places it is so narrow that only a single vehicle can pass. To the south is the new Pont Briwet bridge providing a short-cut to the Harlech road. The bridge is also shared with the Cambrian Coast railway mainline. A new ¬£20m road and rail bridge was opened in 2015, replacing the old wooden structure. For generations, the Grade II listed Pont Briwet carried the Cambrian Coast Railway, allowing people to cross Afon Dwyryd from Penrhyndeudraeth to Llandecwyn along a narrow road suitable for cars only. The new bridge allows all road vehicles to cross and the original toll is no longer applied. The town has two stations, Penrhyndeudraeth railway station on the southern side of the village on the Cambrian Coast Railway from Pwllheli to Shrewsbury and to the north, Penrhyn railway station, on the A4085 near the top of the hill, on the Ffestiniog Railway.  Culture and heritage  According to the 2011 Census, Penrhyndeudraeth is the 19th most Welsh-speaking community in Wales, with approximately 76% of its residents aged three years or older stating that they could speak Welsh. According to the latest Estyn inspection report of the village's primary school, Ysgol Cefn Coch, 79% of pupils come from homes where Welsh is spoken. In an incident in June 2011, with new English landlords of the Royal Oak pub in Penrhyndeudraeth, customers left the pub in anger and were threatened with an airgun after being told to stop ordering their drinks in Welsh. The pub subsequently had a change of management. The Penrhyndeudraeth Children and Young People's Chaired Eisteddfod is held annually at the Memorial Hall. The village is home to the Snowdonia National Park Authority headquarters. There are many language traces of Old Welsh to be found in the place names in the Penrhyndeudraeth area, such as ‚ÄúPont Briwet /Briwet Bridge (Briwet is cognate with the Breton word \\"Brued\\" meaning bridge). Remains of old huts can be found near Ty‚Äôn y Berllan, which date back to the Bronze Age. Penrhyndeudraeth's Alun 'Sbardun' Huws wrote a song, Strydoedd Aberstalwm (approximately \\"streets of long ago\\"), in tribute to the village. His well-known band Y Tebot Piws also recorded their farewell album at Penrhyndeudraeth Memorial Hall in 2011. Football Penrhyndeudraeth F.C. has a senior team and several junior teams. The senior team are currently in their second season in the 2nd Division of the Welsh Alliance League, after finishing third in their first season at this level in 2012-13 and also winning the Take Stock Van Hire Cup (for Division 2 clubs), runners-up in the Mawddach Challenge Cup and also receiving a trophy for the best official matchday programme in the League's 2nd Division. This followed a very successful campaign in the Gwynedd League (2011‚Äì12) when they finished as League Champions and also won the \\"Gwynedd Safeflue\\" and \\"Bob Owen Memorial\\" Shields. The junior teams (under 14, 12, 11, 9 and 7s) all play in the Llyn and Eifionydd Junior Football League.

History A B&M; freight train passes the unused Durham station in 1976. The Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) began service to Durham in 1841, and by the end of the 19th century included 7 to 12 trains per day. The tracks through Durham originally followed a course slightly east of the current alignment, with a station at Main Street. On January 22, 1905, an express train derailed in downtown Durham, injuring 11 passengers and prompting concerns about future crashes in the downtown area. In 1912, prompted by the town and the need to add a second track, the railroad moved its tracks further west away from downtown. Edgewood Road is now built on the former right of way. The B&M; disassembled the underused 1896-built East Lynn station in Lynn, Massachusetts, and rebuilt it on the new alignment at Durham. In 1958, the B&M; was approved to discontinue all its interstate passenger services. The station was sold by the B&M; to UNH for $1 in 1960. On January 4, 1965, the railroad discontinued all service outside Massachusetts except for single round trips to Concord and Dover, the latter of which served Durham. On June 30, 1967, the Concord trip was cut back to Lowell and the Dover trip to Haverhill, ending service to Durham. Regular passenger service returned with the opening of the Downeaster on December 14, 2001. The depot was maintained as a restaurant and renovated in 2007-2008 by the university with funding assistance from the United States Department of Transportation. It reopened on August 11, 2008, featuring an upgraded Dairy Bar (a restaurant operated by UNH Hospitality Services).

It was released on 16 May 2005 by Babel Label. Background Last Chance Disco was created as a reaction to Pete Wareham's frustration with jazz, and his desire to fuse jazz with the \\"ethic and fun of punk\\". The album has been called a mixture of \\"the language of jazz with the rhetoric of instrumental rock\\" by The Guardian. The album has also been described as being \\"closer to thrash metal and grindcore than jazz\\" in an article describing the band as \\"an electric jazz band that plays dirty rock 'n' roll, or a dirty rock 'n' roll band that plays electric jazz\\". The band promoted the album on the UK television show Later... with Jools Holland shortly after the album's release. Last Chance Disco gained critical acclaim from reviewers on release, Jazzwise ultimately naming it the best album of 2005 in their end of year poll. The Observer also ranked the album in their end of year list, calling it the 85th best album of the 2005 (in any genre). As well as receiving praise for the album, the band themselves won 'Best Band' at the BBC Jazz Awards in the same year. Critical reception John L Walters in The Guardian calls the album \\"an all-out assault on the senses\\", stating that \\"this is the least \\"smooth\\" jazz album in years\\". All About Jazz write that Last Chance Disco is \\"a near seamless flow of rapid fire explosions, postmodern beats, raucous instrumental exuberance, passion, anger and, indefinably but unmistakably, hope and optimism\\" and say that this album is a \\"punk jazz orgasm you don't want to miss\\". The BBC review states that this album is \\"the first classic of the post-jazz movement\\" and descrive an album of \\"life-affirmingly dumb shrieks, stomps and power chords\\". Ian Mann writes that Last Chance Disco is \\"one of the albums of 2005 in any genre, and highly recommended to adventurous rock fans as well as hardcore jazz followers\\" in his review. Stylus Magazine wrote in their review that \\"the whole damn album is just great ... a relentless ska-punk-jazz-metal conglomeration that shouldn‚Äôt work but does\\".

It is at the foot of the hill at the eastern edge of the village, alongside the River Taff and adjacent to the Taff Trail. The station is on the Merthyr Line, and is also the northern terminus of the City Line. History Radyr was originally a major railway junction and the location of sidings forming a marshalling yard for freight trains used in the industries in the Glamorgan valleys. It was first opened by the Taff Vale Railway in June 1883\\"Railway Passenger Stations in Great Britain: a Chronology\\" The Railway and Canal Historical Society; Retrieved 25 May 2020, and was originally named Penarth Junction. At one time there were four running lines through the station, up and down passenger and up and down goods on the Taff Vale main line to the valleys northwards and via Llandaff to Cardiff and the docks to the south east. Immediately south of the station, the Cardiff City line diverged southwards and reached the east side of Cardiff via Waterhall Junction, en route to the harbour at Penarth. The marshalling yard was south of the station in the fork between the running lines. Following the down-turn in coal traffic; the marshalling yard closed (in 1993) and the sidings were greatly rationalised, becoming a permanent way depot. The platforms were also rationalised, from five to two, one up and one down. Redevelopment Radyr railway station in May 2000 In 1987 passenger services were introduced on the City Line by British Rail. This made Radyr a bottleneck, as the terminating trains coming from that line occupied the down platform and delays along the line to the Valleys were inevitable. It also allowed diversions for through trains which was beneficial. Redesigned as a commuter station in 1998, major renovations took place, resulting in the two freight lines being replaced by a third platform, eliminating the problem of congestion. Also, a new ticket office was built and modern shelters replaced the old waiting area. These renovations coincided with the upgrades along the Taff Main Line, where the most of the track was replaced between Cardiff and Pontypridd, and the old- fashioned semaphore signals were replaced with modern, colour light signals worked from a new panel box here (this supervises the Rhondda Line all the way to ). These renovation allowed the last of the old sidings to be removed, redeveloped for parking and as a housing developments. Present Ticket office and machine (2015) Today the station, operated by Transport for Wales, has three platforms. Radyr has six northbound services per hour, with a half hourly service to each of , and . There are eight southbound services per hour to , two heading along the City Line that continue to and six going via , with two terminating at Cardiff Central, and four continuing every 15 minutes to , three terminating at and one terminating at . Platform 1 is used by services to Cathays, platform 2 is used for those to and platform 3 for City Line services. Extensive upgrading and modernisation works were completed in late 2017 by Network Rail as part of the Metro project which included improved access to all platforms by a new footbridge. A larger car park has also been provided to supplement the original which provides Much better facilities including good lighting. Wheelchair access is now provided to all platforms via lifts. The ticket office is manned in peak morning hours. Travel time into is 15 minutes on all lines. In July 2007, members of the Radyr Comprehensive Green Flag Committee formally adopted the station and now frequently check that the station is clean and that all amenities are working. This link ties in with a community response to ensure that railway crime is stamped out. Services In Monday-Saturday daytimes, there are usually eight trains an hour from to destinations including , , and . There are eight trains an hour to (two via ) with some trains continuing beyond Cardiff to , (via the Vale of Glamorgan line) and (via the City line).GB eNRT December 2015 Edition, Table 130 (Network Rail) A reduced service operates on Sundays, with no trains on the City line.

The event was organized by the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade until 2009, more recently by the Government of Moscow and Aviasalon. The first show, Mosaeroshow-92, was held in 1992. Since 1993, the air show was renamed as MAKS and is held biennially on odd years. MAKS is an important event for the Russian aviation industry and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Although it started mainly as an entertainment event, the show soon became a marketplace where Russian aerospace companies could negotiate export contracts and Russian air carriers could make foreign contacts. Background and history Sukhoi Su-57 prototype at MAKS-2013 President Putin and Alexander Zelin at MAKS-2011 Tupolev Tu-160 at MAKS-2007 Sukhoi Su-47 Berkut flying in formation at MAKS-2005 Buran aerodynamic analogue BST-02 OK-GLI at MAKS-1999 The air show's history traces back to 1911, when one was held in Mikhailovskiy Square in Saint Petersburg. The Soviet Union held annual air shows on the Tushino Airfield in Moscow 22 years later. Its history in Zhukovskiy, however, began much later with the Engineering Show by TsAGI in 1990. The objective of the MAKS air show is to demonstrate leading technologies and to open up the Russian aerospace industry to the international market. A large portion of the show is dedicated to holding scientific conferences and symposia, under the auspices of Russia's Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute. The air show is held in the city of Zhukovsky, at Zhukovsky International Airport, which is the home of the Gromov Flight Research Institute. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many aviation companies eventually moved to Zhukovsky, using the Gromov Flight Research Institute's airfield for MosAeroShow-92 held on 11‚Äì16 August 1992. A second show was held in 1993, now renamed MAKS. Since then the air show has been held biannually. It lasts for six days, three of which are open to the general public. Most of previous MAKS air shows were systematic: it usually opens with the attendance of the President of Russia, followed by company talks, and concludes with aircraft demonstrations by aerobatic teams such as the Russian Knights, Swifts, and the foreign Patrouille de France as well as Frecce Tricolori. Some highlights include: * The first public unveiling of the forward-swept-wing S-37 (later Su-47) Berkut at MAKS-1999. * The handling of the corporate programs overall cost reductions scandal which made EADS (later Airbus) refuse to attend the same airshow, damaging the image of the airshow substantially. * The first inclusion of American aircraft at MAKS-2003. * The leasing of Plesetsk cosmodrome for launching 5 German SAR-Lupe satellites at MAKS-2003, the first aerospace contract signed throughout the MAKS history. * The unveiling of Kliper cosmic vessel at MAKS-2005. * The tribute flight of 4 Su-27s from the Russian Knights to pay tribute to the team's commander, Igor Tkachenko at MAKS-2009, who died in his aircraft after a collision with another Su-27 during a flight training 2 days prior to the opening of the airshow. * The unveiling of Sukhoi Su-57 prototype at MAKS-2011. * The first inclusion of other foreign aerobatic teams such as the August 1st from China and the Baltic Bees from Latvia at MAKS-2013. Interior criticism A main criticism of the airshow is the large influx of visitors (up to 300,000 people per day). According to some sources, the administration is not doing enough to withstand such a massive number of visitors, which, together with tight security, caused problems such as long queues, congestion and transportation problems. The high cost of public electricity and the lack of air conditioning in the exhibition halls are also subject to criticism. Some critics accused the organizers for still showing outdated Soviet-era aircraft. Critics believe that MAKS is still inferior to other leading airshows of the world, and do not agree with other parts of Russian and western press. Conversely, the Danish daily newspaper B√∏rsen has commented that MAKS is not worse than the Le Bourget and the Farnborough shows. Also, a number of authoritative international organizations such as the Union of Aerospace Industry in Germany and the Chamber of Commerce in France noted the high quality of the event in the official review for MAKS-2009. The airshow administration argues that the airshows are conducted in a highly organized fashion, and are a hallmark of Russia. From a financial perspective, the head of the state corporation \\"Rostekhnologia\\", Sergey Chemezov, has stated the price of participation in MAKS-2009 was quite acceptable as the rented space was about 10% lower than that at the Le Bourget airshow and 1.1 to 1.8 times lower than that at Farnborough. Other facts * The educational \\"MAKSyata\\" club for teenagers was established in 2001, bringing children born in Zhukovskiy in the days of the air show. * At MAKS-2009, employees from the Moscow department of the Federal Bailiff Service(FSSP) of the Russian Federation, in coordination with the staff of the Internal Affairs Directorate carried out a raid on debtors hiding among the visitors of the airshow. Bailiffs stationed near the Vereya village of the Ramenskoye village and intercepted debtors, with a poster that read: \\"Debtor, do you want to experience the feeling of flying?! Pay your debts and fly!\\". A total of more than 12 million rubles was recovered from debtors. Accidents * The prototype Beriev Be-103 amphibious aircraft crashed on the day before the opening of MAKS-1997. After takeoff at 11:14 local time, at an altitude of about 100 meters, the pilot attempted to stay in his designated flight zone by a steep turn, which unintentionally set the aircraft into a steep climb, causing a stall at a supercritical angle of attack without adequate altitude to recover. The pilot was killed. * On August 16, 2009, while preparing for the MAKS-2009, two Sukhoi Su-27s of the Russian Knights aerobatic team crashed into each other, killing the commander of the team and injuring several other people, including residents at \\"Belozyorikha\\" garden community. The death of the pilot was paid tribute to by a minute of silence at the opening of the airshow.

The terrorist Timothy McVeigh was framed. *Judaism is the most evil satanic cult that ever existed and Jews are conspiring to overtake the whole world through deceit and cultic worship. *Hillary Clinton is a doctrinaire Marxist who has recruited other America-hating subversives for key administration posts. Hillary Clinton also has Orwellian political ambitions. According to Marrs: \\"Bill Clinton is an establishment hack, a member of the traitorous Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, and Council of Foreign Relations.

Public behavior Marrs has been accused of being anti-Catholic. In 1999 he alleged that former United States President George H. W. Bush would be involved in a black mass in a chamber within the Great Pyramid of Giza during the 2000 millennium celebrations. ‚Äì \\"David Icke, a former British television sportscaster turned prophet of doom, and Texe Marrs, a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned pastor, have issued Web site warnings that, come millennium eve, former President George Bush and fellow members of a cult known as the Illuminati will summon oppressive evil forces at a black mass in a burial chamber deep inside the great Cheops pyramid.\\" Christian writer Constance Cumbey has accused Marrs of plagiarizing material from her book Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow. She requested her name never be associated with Texe Marrs because of his exaggerations and blatant anti-Semitism. Additionally, Texe Marrs has promoted a book, The Greatest Lie on Earth: Proof That Our World is Not a Moving Globe, by Edward Hendrie, which alleges that the planet Earth is immobile and flat. Marrs also offers Hendrie's book which asserts this argument through his ministry,Book as listed on Marr's website (7/2016) . and books by Hendrie alleging that the world is being manipulated by a vast Jewish-Catholic conspiracy.Although not indexed by author, Marrs is selling Hendrie's Solving the Mystery of Babylon the Great, Bloody Zion, and Anti- Christ: The Beast Revealed; there are at least four other religious-oriented books by Hendrie not being sold by Marrs.

There is no scheduled airline service available, but it once was served by Air New England. Although many U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, this airport is assigned UUU by the FAA and NPT by the IATA (which assigned UUU to Manumu, Papua New Guinea). Newport State Airport is one of six active airports operated by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the other five being T.F. Green State Airport, North Central State Airport, Westerly State Airport, Quonset State Airport, and Block Island State Airport.  History  At the turn of the 20th Century the site was home to Aquidneck Park, a horse racing track. Wealthy summer residents such as Willie K Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor and I. Townsend Burden would occasionally race automobiles of various types there. The airport site was acquired by the state in July 1960, and construction of the runways and taxiways was completed by September 1967. At least one runway was operational by July 1964, when the first aircraft accident at the Newport airport (a gear-up landing) was documented by the National Transportation Safety Board. The first fatal accident at Newport State Airport was a mid-air collision between two general aviation aircraft on April 23, 1969.

It is a spoof of Star Wars and The Crocodile Hunter, with Boba Fett sliding into the Steve Irwin role, hunting Jedi along with his wife \\"Terri Fett\\". While the film primarily spoofs the Star Wars universe in the format of a Crocodile Hunter special, there are several other notable targets, including swipes at Army of Darkness, \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee, Star Trek, Shaft, The Princess Bride, and Aliens. The film starts with a quick series of faux channel changes, opening with a cameo appearance by Crazy Watto and continuing with Star Wars versions of Cheers and The Six Million Dollar Man. The film bears the odd credit \\"Special Thanks to Peter Mayhew for giving us the inspiration ‚Äì that's right, blame the Wookiee!\\" According to Star Wars Insider, this credit is due to a missed dinner engagement with the Star Wars actor, which led the filmmakers to amuse themselves while waiting for him, eventually hitting upon the idea that became this film. They good-naturedly credit his not appearing at dinner with kick- starting the film. The film has played at many film festivals, and proven popular with Star Wars fans, winning several awards, including Best Visual Effects at the 2003 Dahlonega International Film Festival, and the Audience Choice Award in the Lucasfilm-sponsored 2003 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards.

Origin and growth of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty The dynasty's origin dates back to the 9th century, when the P≈ôemyslids ruled a tiny territory around Prague, populated by the Czech tribe of the Western Slavs. Gradually they expanded, conquering the region of Bohemia, located in the Bohemian basin where it was not threatened by the expansion of the Frankish Empire. The first historically-documented P≈ôemyslid duke was Bo≈ôivoj I (867). In the following century, the P≈ôemyslids also ruled over Silesia and founded the city of Wroclaw (German: Breslau), derived from the name of a Bohemian duke, Vratislaus I, father of Saint Wenceslaus. Under the reign of Prince Boleslaus I the Cruel (935) and his son Boleslaus II the Pious (972), the P≈ôemyslids ruled territory stretching to today's Belarus. The dynasty controlled vital trade routes during this time. The Bohemian lands and Prague were an important center of trade where merchants from all of Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the Hispano-Jewish merchant and traveller Ibrahim ibn Ya'qub. He wrote, \\"Prague is a city from the stone, the richest of all states north of the Alps.\\" After their rise to prominence, however, struggles within the family set in motion a decline in power and, in 1002, the Polish duke Boleslaus the Brave occupied Prague. Boleslaus III, son of Boleslaus II, escaped from Bohemia; decades of confusion and anarchy ensued. The decline ended in the reign of Prince Bretislaus I, grandson of Boleslaus II. He in turn looted Poland, including the cities of Krakow and Gniezno (1038), where he obtained the relics of St. Adalbert. He sought the establishment of the Prague archbishopric and a royal title. His son and successor Vratislaus II became the first King of Bohemia in 1085. Vratislav's son Sobeslaus I destroyed the Imperial army of King Lothar III in the Battle of Chlumec in 1126. This allowed a further strengthening of Bohemia, culminating during the reign of Vratislav's grandson, King Vladislaus II (1158). Vladislav II founded many monasteries and built the first stone bridge across the Vltava river, one of the earliest in Central and Northern Europe. Once again, internal struggles started the decline of the P≈ôemyslids. Many leaders from the dynasty alternated on the Bohemian throne, leading to their eventual bankruptcy. Finally, on his ascension to the throne, Ottokar I began a series of changes that brought Bohemia out of crisis, and began a period of success that lasted for nearly 220 years. At the height of its power Last three P≈ôemyslid kings according to illumination from the Chronicon Aulae regiae: P≈ôemysl Ottokar II (one crown ‚Äì Bohemia), Wenceslaus II (two crowns ‚Äì Bohemia and Poland) and Wenceslaus III (three crowns ‚Äì Hungary, Bohemia and Poland) Bohemian king Wenceslaus II as the King of Poland, a romantic drawing by Jan Matejko (1892) Ottokar I became the third King of Bohemia in the year 1198 but was the first King of Bohemia to acquire a hereditary royal title. This began significant growth of the P≈ôemyslids' dynastic power. There was also a large urban and crafts development in Bohemia. In the second half of the 13th century, the P≈ôemyslids were one of the most powerful dynasties in Central Europe. King P≈ôemysl Ottokar II, son of Wenceslas I, earned the nickname \\"Iron and Golden King\\" because of his military power and wealth. After several victorious wars with the Hungarian Kingdom, he acquired Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, extending Bohemian territory to the Adriatic Sea. King Ottokar II aspired to the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire. His ambitions started the conflict with House of Habsburg, who were, until then, little-known counts, which suited the interests of German noble houses better than the mighty king Ottokar. The representative of Habsburgs Rudolf was elected as King of Romans. In the Battle of Marchfeld (1278), Ottokar clashed with Imperial and Hungarian armies yet he was killed in battle himself. The Habsburgs acquired Austria, retaining it until the 20th century. Ottokar's son King Wenceslaus II was just seven when he came to the throne of Bohemia. Over time, thanks to deft diplomacy, he gained the Polish crown for himself and the crown of Hungary for his son. Wenceslas II brought together a vast empire stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Danube River and established numerous cities, among them Plze≈à in 1295. Bohemia became a wealthy nation during his reign thanks to a large vein of silver at Kutn√° Hora. He introduced the silver Prague groschen, which was an important European currency for centuries, and planned to build the first university in Central Europe. The power and wealth of the Kingdom of Bohemia gave rise to great respect, but also to the hostility of other European royal families. The dynasty began to collapse following the untimely death of Wenceslaus II (1305), and the assassination of his only son, Wenceslaus III in 1306, which ended their rule. On the distaff side, however, the dynasty continued, and in 1355, Bohemian king Charles IV, the grandson of Wenceslaus II, was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome. Legendary rulers The name of the dynasty, according to Cosmas in his Chronica Boemorum (1119), comes from its legendary founder, P≈ôemysl, husband of duchess Libu≈°e.Peter Demetz.

In 895, Bohemia gained independence from Great Moravia. Between 1003 and 1004, Bohemia was controlled by Boleslaus the Brave, Duke of Poland from the Piast dynasty, grandson of Boleslaus I the Cruel. In 1085, Duke Vratislaus II, and, in 1158, Duke Vladislaus II, were crowned King of Bohemia as a personal award from the Holy Roman Emperor. The title, however, was not hereditary. *Bo≈ôivoj I (c.870‚Äì889) *Spytihnƒõv I (895‚Äì915) *Vratislaus I (915‚Äì921) *Saint Wenceslaus (Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia) (921‚Äì935) *Boleslaus I the Cruel (935‚Äì972) *Boleslaus II the Pious (972‚Äì999) *Boleslaus III the Red-haired (999‚Äì1002) *Vladivoj (1002‚Äì1003) *Boleslaus IV (1003‚Äì1004) *Jarom√≠r (1004‚Äì1012) *Ulrich (1012‚Äì1033) *Jarom√≠r (1033‚Äì1034) *Ulrich (1034) *Bretislaus I (1035‚Äì1055) *Spytihnƒõv II (1055‚Äì1061) *Vratislaus II (1061‚Äì1092), king (1085‚Äì1092) as Vratislav I. *Conrad I of Brno (1092) *Bretislaus II (1092‚Äì1100) *Bo≈ôivoj II (1101‚Äì1107) *Svatopluk (1107‚Äì1109) *Vladislaus I (1109‚Äì1117) *Bo≈ôivoj II (1117‚Äì1120) *Vladislaus I (1120‚Äì1125) *Sobeslaus I (1125‚Äì1140) *Vladislaus II (1140‚Äì1172), king (1158‚Äì1172) as Vladislaus I *Frederick (1172‚Äì1173) *Sobeslaus II (1173‚Äì1178) *Frederick (1178‚Äì1189) *Conrad II Otto (1189‚Äì1191) *Wenceslaus II (1191‚Äì1192) *Ottokar I (1192‚Äì1193) *Henry Bretislaus (1193‚Äì1197) *Vladislaus Henry (1197) *Ottokar I (1197‚Äì1198) Kings of Bohemia Maximum extent of the kingdom under Ottokar II, c. 1276 Bohemia was the only princedom in the Holy Roman Empire which was raised to the status of kingdom prior to the Napoleonic wars. The reason for this was strength: as soon as Bohemia overcame its civil strife, the Czech duke became the principal ally for any candidate for the Imperial throne. The emperor could thus use Bohemian forces to punish any rebels who were Czech neighbours simply by raiding their lands. This is evinced by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV naming Prince Vratislaus II of Bohemia the first king of Bohemia, Vratislav I, in 1085. He was raised to this prominent position not long after his father Bretislaus pacified Bohemia after years of civil conflict. The kingship was disputed whenever Czech internal conflict increased. It was fixed, however, after the position of the emperor in Germany weakened. In 1198, Duke Ottokar I again gained the title of King of Bohemia as an ally of Philip of Swabia. This title was reconfirmed by Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor and later on in Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor's Golden Bull of Sicily (1212). *Ottokar I (czech P≈ôemysl Otakar I.)

He also founded the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. In 1300, King Wenceslaus II was crowned King of Poland. Prior to this, he held the title \\"High Duke of Poland (Duke of Krak√≥w)\\" since 1291 and became its overlord upon the death of Przemys≈Ç II of Poland in 1296. *Wenceslaus II (1300‚Äì1305) *Wenceslaus III (1305‚Äì1306), also King of Hungary (1301‚Äì1305) as Ladislaus V The royal line ended in 1306 with the death of King Wenceslaus III. The Bohemian throne went to the Luxembourgs, and the Polish throne returned to the Piasts. Dukes of Opava, Krnov, Ratibor and M√ºnsterberg In 1269, Nicholas, bastard son of King Ottokar II who was legitimized by pope Alexander IV in 1260, became Duke of Opava. In 1337, his son Nicholas II inherited the Duchy of Ratibor. His four sons divided the Duchy of Opava (the Duchy of Ratibor was inherited only by the eldest, John). Thus started the partition of a once-unified land between the descendants of Nicholas II. In 1443, William, Duke of Opava gained the Duchy of M√ºnsterberg, which was held by P≈ôemyslids until 1456. This line of Opavian P≈ôemyslids ended in 1521, with the death of Valentine, Duke of Ratibor.

His kinetic works (1959-1966) as well suggest the expression of movement, until it becomes incantatory hallucination. While adopting a minimalist approach in his quest for purity (19601963 and 1968-1971), he rejects its theoretical and formal constraints, to which he never totally submits. Let it be in his paintings, drawings or sculptures, his most simple compositions or most stripped forms ‚Äì from the abstract figures that inhabits them ‚Äì suggest movement, time passing by, a future to come. In that regard, his art constantly stands on the fringe of the aesthetic movements to which he relates to, imposing to the latter his own questionings, his own singular approach. All of his work translates, in its own mutations, a will to simultaneously grasp the present and forecast the future, reflecting the thought typical of his era. As a witness of his time, he broadens his art with new visions inspired from science and new technologies. His interest in psychoanalysis leads him to make use of the unconscious in his Automatist gestural works (1946-1957). From his observations using electronic optical instruments, he wanted to express the infinitesimal and the infinitely big in his Taschist paintings (1954-1956). In New York (1965-1968), he refines his kinetic studies by meeting with researchers working at Bell Laboratory. As a painter and sculptor, Barbeau has addressed most of the fields in visual arts. As a multidisciplinary artist, he tried to change the plastic language by transgressing disciplinary boundaries. His collages became paintings (1959-1963 and 1986-2005), art prints (1969) and sculptures (1984-1988). His drawings of poems, made of words and letters, have sometimes borrowed their medium and relief from painting (1957). His sculptures remind of drawings thrown in space (1971-1977) or look like small shelters, almost architectural (1985-1992). His performances, real stagings of the act of creation, materialized through paintings, drawings and, under his directive with the complicity of photographers or film directors, through photographs, films and videos, giving some permanence to otherwise ephemeral artistic gestures (1972-1980). Curiosity leads Barbeau to study the main contemporary artistic trends originating from other disciplinary fields. His interest for those art forms encourage him to draw on their problematics, structures or writing processes in order to find some convergences, connivances, anchor points or to confirm aesthetic intuitions. He thus uses poetry, music, dance and architecture to renew his art, but not as subjects nor models. For example, his phonic calligraphies (1957-1960) inspired from his friend Claude Gauvreau‚Äôs poetry, his drawings inspired from Grupen by Stockhausen (1957-1960) or his interdisciplinary events from the seventies and the eighties. He even created works that fall under these disciplines: his phonic chants from the mid-eighties, which appear in the portrait film by Manon Barbeau entitled Barbeau, Libre comme l‚Äôart; his dances-action paintings from the seventies; the choreography he created for the opening dance part of his exhibit at Domaine Cataraqui (1999). Despite its diversity and its profusion, his work reveals a profound unity in its writing, which materializes in his preference for diagonal axes, for compositions showing fragile equilibrium and in his spatiotemporal approach to the visual world. Barbeau thus expresses his fascination for movement as a bearer of desire and of time measure. He also stands out for the symbolic dimension and irony that translate from the title of his purest abstractions. As a \\"baroque\\" artist, his work falls within a fusional approach to artistic creation, while revealing his search for formal perfection and plastic equilibrium. Economy of means and aesthetic perfection being of great concern for him, Barbeau still needs to express emotions in an elated way and refers to the unconscious, even in his paintings, let them be optical, geometrical, minimalist or serial. Thus, his work reveals itself as a permanent and utopian quest in reaching the synthesis of opposites.Ninon Gauthier, PhD, historienne de l'art, Marcel Barbeau : Then and now, 2013.

I. Go Pop is the second studio album by English post-rock band Disco Inferno, released on 28 February 1994. After forming as a post-punk band in 1989, the band subsequently worked towards an innovative production approach that incorporated found sound elements through extensive use of digital samplers. The band released several critically acclaimed EPs in this vein from 1992‚Äì93, and recorded D. I. Go Pop concurrently with some of those preceding EPs, working with producer Charlie McIntosh. The album cover, designed by Fuel and featuring photography by David Spero, has been described as \\"one of the most indelible album cover images in the '90s.\\" The album was released by Rough Trade Records in the United Kingdom and by Bar/None Records in the United States. It did not chart and was mostly overlooked on release, bar some positive reviews. However, it has since gone on to be considered an innovative and influential album and a key release in the history of post-rock. Numerous bands have cited it as an influence. It has been featured in several lists of the greatest albums of the 1990s and of all time. The album was remastered and re-released by One Little Indian Records in March 2004, bringing the album renewed attention from both critics and music buyers. Background Disco Inferno formed in 1989 in Essex by teenagers Ian Crause (guitars and vocals), Paul Willmott (bass), Daniel Gish (keyboards) and Rob Whatley (drums), although Gish soon quit the band to join Bark Psychosis, leaving Disco Inferno to become a trio. They were initially a post-punk band heavily influenced by bands such as Joy Division and Wire, releasing their first album Open Doors, Closed Windows (1991) alongside the \\"Entertainment\\"/\\"Arc in Round\\" single, also from 1991, and 1992's Science EP, all of which were compiled onto the compilation In Debt (1992). However, Crause soon became infatuated with the unique sounds of bands My Bloody Valentine and the Young Gods, as well as the Bomb Squad's revolutionary production and sampling on the music of Public Enemy, and with the release of the Summer's Last Sound EP, released later on in 1992, the band's musical style shifted towards sample-based electronic sounds. The band \\"hit upon a seemingly simple but ultimately world-opening idea\\" with the EP: to write their instruments through samplers, and unlike their contemporaries who only sampled elements of music, film dialogue or other media, Disco Inferno \\"engaged with the whole world\\", using their set up to record additional sounds as well, ranging from running water, the wind, whistling birds, boots, car crashes and angry voices. Crause had purchased a Roland S-750 sampler with his savings and started programming towards the band's sound for six months. In a 2011 interview, Wilmott recalled of the era: The production style of Public Enemy and the Bomb Squad was an important influence on Disco Inferno. Summer's Last Sound was praised for its uncompromising, innovative and experimental sound, and the group expanded the approach with their subsequent EPs A Rock to Cling To (July 1993) and The Last Dance (November 1993), both of which were released on Rough Trade Records after their previous label Cheree closed. According to Andy Kellman of AllMusic, the new label \\"saved the band's life, as the members believed that they were too challenging for anyone else to understand or care for.\\" Kellman commented that, \\"disorienting, confusing, and highly schizophrenic, the challenging releases were in direct contrast to the prevailing Britpop scene of the time,\\" taking \\"A.R. Kane's futurist pop a couple steps further and secured a devout and small following that found solace in their wildly imaginative, peerless nature.\\" The band became characterized as one of the first post-rock bands. Recording The band began work on their second studio album concurrently with some of the band's later EPs in 1993. However, despite the critical success of the band's EPs, the band had not been commercially successful. A journalist at The Quietus recalled that \\"the sparse tiny-numbered disconnection of DI's audience, the rarity of finding anyone else who understood just how great they were, became disheartening,\\" despite the praises of the band written by David Stubbs, Taylor Parkes, Lucy Cage, Jon Selzer and Simon Price in the British music press. Crause recalled, \\"I remember our manager once telling us we had enough good reviews to wallpaper our houses with but we needed to pay our bills. It did start to become apparent in the last year or so that the reviews, especially in Melody Maker, counted for absolutely nothing in sales terms, which I belatedly came to realise were the be all and end all of being in a band if we needed to survive.\\" As such, the band recorded D. I. Go Pop under Crause's increasing tension, working with producer Charlie McIntosh, seeking to continue the evolution of the band's sample-based sound. Although the time between writing and recording was usually very short for the band, not leaving \\"much time to fully evolve each cycle,\\" the writing and recording of D. I. Go Pop was the longest time that the band had spent outside a studio concentrating on a spread of songs. Wilmott recalled in 2011 that he finds it difficult when he hears \\"about Ian's issues throughout this period, as they are usually horribly remembered and pay little or no attention to his own behaviour which can at best be described as erratic.\\" Tracks from the album had been worked on in conjunction with songs from the earlier-released EPs. Some of the album's tracks were worked on by the band at the same time as \\"Summer's Last Sound\\" and \\"Love Stepping Out\\", the two songs from the Summer's Last Sound EP in 1992, their first sample-based release. Crause recalled that \\"Summer's Last Sound\\" and those particular D. I. Go Pop songs \\"sounded much more exciting\\" than \\"Love Stepping Out\\". Ned Raggett of The Quietus noted that the band's following EP, A Rock to Cling To, was recorded at the same time as the songs that would eventually form D. I. Go Pop. Wilmott recalled that the title track of A Rock to Cling To was \\"very much a part of the D. I. Go Pop sessions\\" and was originally intended to appear on the album. Crause and Wilmott had also both read The Timelords' \\"how to have a number one single\\" book The Manual, which \\"bizarrely\\" had an effect on the way that they approached this batch of songs, and the title Go Pop reflected that. Music D. I. Go Pop furthers the band's sample-based innovative sound, and is often said to be the band's most uncommercial and least \\"pop\\" album, bringing irony to the album title. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters said that, after the innovative post-rock sound established on the EPs, \\"the band was quickly moving toward something big, and it would all come to a head on [D. I. Go Pop]\\". According to Scott Plangehoff of Pitchfork, the album is \\"the most challenging and least 'pop' full-length in the band's catalog,\\" adding that it \\"retains the arpeggios and fractured melodicism of their then-recent singles, and adds increasing layers of disorienting samples and paranoia.\\" He commented that \\"D. I. Go Pop is an album of contradictions: Prescient, uneasy ballads like 'Even the Sea Sides Against Us' and 'A Whole Wide World Ahead' recoil from the potential cruelty of human nature but are tethered by an aching off-kilter beauty.\\" Critics have described D. I. Go Pop as a post-rock and experimental rock album. Ned Raggett of The Quietus said the album was an album of \\"urban sound with seaside and seasonal reveries that aren't quite that, a burst of activity that could also be a last gasp.\\" Writing for AllMusic, he said that \\"pop hooks existed on the record, but only in the most spare, hard-to-find of forms; otherwise, Disco Inferno was out to create an album to challenge as many listeners as possible without fully embracing a noise approach.\\" Begrand said that \\"one would expect that the end result would wind up being nothing more than a chaotic, noisy, haphazard, cut-and-paste attempt at musical assemblage, and yeah, there is a fair bit of cacophony on this album, but like My Bloody Valentine‚Äôs timeless classic Loveless, underneath the din is an album of such startling beauty, and even more surprising structure, that once you notice it, it seems like a huge revelation.\\" Raggett also commented that Rob Whatley was \\"transformed\\" from being \\"just\\" a drummer to \\"someone also playing percussive samples and other sounds\\", which \\"took the man/machine focus of a figure like Stephen Morris and ratcheted it up into a different realm,\\" whilst Crause was described as writing \\"angry\\" lyrics for the album. Crause, \\"an admitted misanthrope,\\" often delivered a \\"very bleak, Morrissey-esque worldview\\" in his lyrics on the band's early singles, and Begrand noted that \\"although you do hear bits and pieces of a similar sentiment on this album (‚ÄúChameleon skin/Is what you need to be in/When nothing's as it appears/Why should you be?‚Äù), his vocals are buried so deeply in the mix, it's impossible to tell just exactly what he's singing most of the time.\\" The plaintive, melancholy \\"Even the Sea Sides Against Us\\", one of the more instantly accessible songs on the album, revisits the more post-punk sound of their earlier material, as Crause's lyrics \\"sound as charmingly morose as ever (\\"We're waiting for a future to come and sweep us away\\").\\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork said that \\"on much of the album, Crause's bitterness and aggression seems trapped in a swirl of larger sounds, his voice and fears struggling to be heard or comprehended above the dins of abstract noise and the weight of the world around him.\\" =Composition= According to Raggett, opening song \\"In Sharky Water\\" begins with water sounds, a basic bass and a drum's low pulse, before leading into \\"the drowsy swing of the band followed by the most abstract aggression anyone had ever come up with since Wire on 154.\\" \\"New Clothes for the New World\\" features Crause's \\"distorted and fragmented\\" vocals playing against \\"ragged\\" church bell samples and a jaunty whistle. Raggett noted his voice and lyrics project \\"the electronic paranoia which Radiohead polished up very well for OK Computer, but he's all the much more intense, crackling with a nervous energy and lingering horror for what will be just around the corner.\\" \\"Starbound: All Burnt Out & Nowhere to Go\\" features \\"camera clicks\\" and a looping, \\"squiggly 'everybody everybody' chant\\" alongside \\"deliberate guitar pluckings\\". \\"A Crash at Every Speed\\" features a \\"guitar grind\\" playing \\"amidst the trebly chaos of keyboards, cars, glass shards [and] planes.\\" \\"Even the Sea Sides Against Us\\" \\"floats on an acoustic guitar bed endlessly looping around a series of wave sounds and odd keyboard touches, and so forth.\\" Raggett noted how the song \\"turns to the profoundly, coldly, electrically beautiful, soft strum-like sounds, high twinkles, an unexpected balm even as Crause pitilessly notes 'You don't expect to be seen, you don't expect to be heard.'\\" \\"Next Year\\" features \\"plaintive\\" vocals performing as \\"an odd voice of hope amidst wheezing, clattering sounds and crunch.\\" Raggett said that \\"A Whole Wide World Ahead\\" conjures up \\"the acoustic guitar/rain combination in newer, stranger ways, odd unexpected rhythms, [with] Crause noting, 'There's not enough shelter from all the madness around' as the melancholy flow gets more desperate and lost.\\" The album finishes with \\"Footprints in Snow\\", which \\"sparkles and twinkles\\" and was the described as the album's only moment \\"of hope\\". Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine called it one of the \\"loveliest songs of D.I.‚Äôs career.\\" The song ends with a found sound tape recording of a landlady of a Stratford, London pub asking the band to turn the volume down, taken from one of the band's early concerts. Album cover The album cover was the second sleeve designed by design agency Fuel, following on from The Last Dance EP and being continued by the Second Language EP, and as with the EPs, it features a landscape photograph by David Spero with the Disco Inferno radar logo superimposed. Fuel were originally contacted by the band's manager Mike Collins, who had seen their work through a piece about them in The Sunday Times, and thought their aesthetic matched that of the band. Crause recalled that, \\"at first, [Fuel] used to call us in and have a chat about some ideas they'd had, but after a couple of releases we were so headfucked by their covers that we just let them do exactly what they wanted. I have always thought we had some of the best record sleeves of the 90s. In that period, Fuel are about the only people I'm aware of who equaled those extraordinary Factory and 4AD sleeves from the 70s and 80s.\\" Fuel desired to design a bold logo for the band to give them a strong identity from the start, with the original symbol dating back to the 1930s and having a \\"simultaneous clarity and ambiguity that complimented their sound.\\" For all three releases, they worked with photographer David Spero, whose landscape photographs were described as \\"quite unusual for a record sleeve at the time; they were beautiful images of nothingness. The direction of the logo changed with each sleeve to suit the image and echo the idea of sound traveling in different directions. Both the music and art had an ambiguity about them; the band had taken a step into a creative unknown, and the covers reflected this.\\" Andrew Swainson, who had designed the pre-Last Dance album sleeves, said although he \\"was gutted at the time\\" that the band had switched sleeve designers for The Last Dance, he still bought D. I. Go Pop. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters said the album cover become better known than the album itself in North America, saying \\"if you lived in North America, far away from a good record store, the only thing you would know about Disco Inferno‚Äôs album D. I. Go Pop would be its distinctive cover art. That photograph of a pastoral English setting, bluntly obscured by a white circle in the center, with three arcs extending outward, looking like monstrous sound waves emitting from the middle of a lake, was one of the most indelible album cover images in the '90s, yet so few people actually heard the music inside.\\" Release D. I. Go Pop was released on 28 February 1994 on Rough Trade Records in the United Kingdom as a CD and LP and Bar/None Records shortly afterwards in the United States as only a CD. The LP edition featured a sticker of the band's logo on the cover bearing the album title and band name to identify it from the front. No singles were released to promote the album, and it charted in neither country, but the good press of the band in the UK nonetheless increased interest in the band, and in the United States, the album still found an audience despite its near-total lack of promotion. Neil Kulkarni of The Quietus said that \\"weirdly for such an elementally British band, DI have long been of almost mythical status in the US. My old Maker/Metal Hammer mucker Jon Selzer recalls wearing a rare orange DI shirt to Washington DC and being stopped every five minutes by someone insistent on telling him how much DI meant to them.\\" The album title shares its name with the second song on the band's 1993 EP The Last Dance. One Little Indian Records remastered and re-released D. I. Go Pop and the band's following album Technicolour on CD on 9 March 2004 in the UK and 20 April 2004 in the US, coinciding with the tenth anniversary of D. I. Go Pop. In the US, this re-release was part of One Little Indian's \\"Crossing the Pond\\" series of remastered editions of British albums that were never released domestically in the United States. PopMatters said that \\"a full decade after D. I. Go Pop's initial release, it's the perfect opportunity for people to discover one of rock's most innovative, tragically overlooked bands, and might I add, it's about bloody time.\\" Pitchfork considered the remasters of the two albums to be \\"the jewels in the crown of One Little Indian's 'Crossing the Pond' reissue campaign\\" alongside A.R. Kane's 69 (1988) and i (1989). D. I. Go Pop was reissued on vinyl for the first time since its original release by One Little Indian Records on 1 December 2017. Critical reception The album was mostly overlooked at the time of release by music critics. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters said the album \\"didn't get heaps of press\\" in either the UK or North America. However, he did note that \\"if you read British music magazines around 1994, there was a good chance you probably came across a small article or two about a young band called Disco Inferno. You'd read quotes about how their album was unlike anything anybody had done before, how utterly incredible it was.\\" An early review came from David Landgren of the online magazine Consumable in November 1994, who rated the album eight out of ten, saying \\"this is altogether a brilliantly executed album, a lonely outpost on the darker reaches of rock'n'roll. Once again, this shows just how innovative the English can be when in comes to rock music. This deserves to be in the collection of anyone who prides themselves on owning a diverse and well- rounded range of music.\\" Spanish magazine Rockdelux ranked the album at number 22 in their \\"Albums of the Year\\" list at the end of 1994, but Begrand recalled that \\"the album was completely shut out when the major publications made their year-end lists\\" in the UK or North America. In January 1995, it caught the attention of American magazine Alternative Press, who reviewed the album very favourably, saying \\"this uncheerful British trio are forging challenging music that threatens to break free of rock's shackles. This frigid, melancholy music bristles with a contrary adventurousness. Amazing stuff that will sadly hit too few ears.\\" The album has gone on to receive increasing attention and critical acclaim, especially after the release of its 2004 remastered edition which Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine said led to the album being \\"formally embraced by, in some cases, the critics who neglected it the first time around.\\" Ned Raggett, in a review for AllMusic, rated the album four-and- a-half stars out of five, saying that \\"Go Pop resembles no other album so much as Wire's 154 for the modern day--very English, encompassing a variety of styles and approaches, seemingly totally cryptic yet more touching to the mind, body and soul than anyone might have expected,\\" and concluding that, \\"probably one of the only bands truly worthy of the term 'post-rock,' Disco Inferno is heading in a direction that no previous band has fully embraced.\\" Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Adrien Begrand was very positive. He said that although the band's sample-based EPs are just as essential, \\"it's the band's irreverent genius and the meticulous arrangements on D. I. Go Pop that stick in your mind the longest\\" and commented that \\"unlike that grouchy landlady [featured at the end of the album], you'll be wanting to turn this music up, not down.\\" In the May 2005 issue of Spin, Andrew Beaujon, reviewing Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, told readers to \\"also try\\" D. I. Go Pop, describing it as \\"English goofballs [finding] beauty in frustration, futility and a computer lab's worth of obsolete machines losing their shit.\\" David James of Optimistic Underground said in 2009 that he \\"won't try to describe the sounds [on the album] other than, generally speaking, they were far ahead of their time in the use of sampling, presaging everything from Matmos to The Books to Animal Collective's later albums,\\" calling it a \\"truly worthy yet well-hidden gem.\\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said the album was a \\"shot heard 'round the corner, if that: a lost masterpiece of evocative blur channeling Joy Division's melodic gloom through My Bloody Valentine's blissful noise-swarms, with sample loops outgunning the guitars.\\" Tiny Mix Tapes were also very positive, saying \\"Disco Inferno simply wanted to shine on us the light of a fundamentally strange hue, a new context in which to enjoy pop music forms. This won't decimate society and crush your religion. It will tweak your eardrums, and may just plant a knowing grin on your face.\\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork rated the album 9.3/10, saying \\"D. I. Go Pop retains the arpeggios and fractured melodicism of their then-recent singles, and adds increasing layers of disorienting samples and paranoia\\" and said it was \\"nearly as urgent and key\\" as the band's sample-based EPs. In 2011, Eye Plug noted that Pitchforks review resulted in a swell of activity across internet message boards, and \\"appears to have left a continued wake of interest.\\" Andrew Unterberger of Stylus Magazine, although a fan of the album, found it imperfect without the inclusion of several of the songs from the prior EPs, and chose the album for a \\"Playing God\\" feature for the magazine in which he picked a definitive, personalised track list for the album. Aftermath and legacy Disco Inferno released two more EPs later on in 1994: Second Language, which became \\"Single of the Week\\" in Melody Maker, and It's a Kid World, whilst they recorded their third and final album Technicolour shortly afterwards following the theft of the band's samplers, but the band ultimately split up, leaving Technicolour unreleased until mid-1996. Wilmott said that he found the band's dissolution to be frustrating, since they were \\"finally getting some recognition\\" when they split, recalling that \\"the last gig that we had played was our biggest, headlining at The Purcell Room which was also featured as a Mixing It session on Radio 3.\\" Technicolour moved the band towards a slightly more accessible and pop-influenced sound than D. I. Go Pop, although it still retained the band's trademark experimental sound. It was well received by music critics but not as well as D. I. Go Pop. Despite the underground status of D. I. Go Pop, it has gone on to become considered by critics and musicians to be a groundbreaking and innovative release and an important post-rock album. Bands such as The Avalanches, Deerhunter, Animal Collective and MGMT have acknowledged the band and the album as a big influence, with MGMT's Ben Goldwasser rhapsodizing that they \\"still sound like the future.\\" However, the album's unique approach is said to have been seldom replicated, with PopMatters stating in 2005 that \\"as current artists like Manitoba and Four Tet have the technology to assemble albums much more easily these days, the painstaking lengths that Disco Inferno went to perfect their sound in those pre-folktronica days is only occasionally duplicated today.\\" David James said that \\"this batch of tunes was far ahead of its time in the use of sampling, presaging everything from the cut-and-paste electronica of Matmos to Animal Collective‚Äôs pop breakthrough Merriweather Post Pavilion.\\" Johnny Mugwamp of Fact considers the album to be \\"absolute fucking bedlam\\" and \\"the most important album of the 1990s.\\" Writing for The Quietus in 2014, Ned Raggett said that \\"to me D. I. Go Pop is itself still fresh. And it IS fresh, a knotted twisted agglomeration of approaches from the time when post rock as a term made a certain sense, the idea that a kind of form had been perfected, so why not explode it?\\" He opined that Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer was \\"a far more glossy take on what D. I. Go Pop was trying to articulate, far more glossy and far less specific, far more comfortable. And I do speak as a Radiohead fan,\\" adding that \\"time itself points out other comparisons to me ‚Äì one friend described what Disco Inferno were doing here and elsewhere as being 'a digital This Heat', looking back to an earlier set of UK prophets without honour; another explicitly made a connection to the maniacal vivisections of sound by Australian legends Severed Heads, who Crause later spoke about hearing well after the fact ‚Äì sometimes the connections are out there, but implied rather than direct. A similar sense of seeing a limit then wondering, 'Why stop?' Destructive or self-destructive in some cases, but when talking about art rather than dissipation, a very understandable impulse.\\" Commenting on the album's relevance in 2014, he said: D. I. Go Pop is often considered to be the best of the band's works alongside the sample-based EPs, which were later gathered together for release as The 5 EPs in 2011. Nonetheless, in a 2011 interview with The Quietus, Crause said \\"I like the fact there seems to be no consensus about what our best recordings are. Some people like D. I. Go Pop most, some the EPs and some Technicolor. All will say they have proof of why X is the best as opposed to the others. I like that and I have no favourite.\\" =Accolades= In 1999, music journalist Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 5 on his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties\\" for Freaky Trigger. In 2000, Rockdelux ranked the album at number 101 in their list of \\"The 150 Best Albums from the 90s,\\" and in 2014, they ranked it at number 235 on their list of \\"The 300 Best Albums from 1984‚Äì2014.\\" In 2011, music critic Neil Kulkarni named it \\"the 2nd greatest British LP of the 90s\\" in an article about the band for The Quietus. In 2015, Fast 'n' Bulbous ranked the album at number 182 in their list of \\"The 1000 Best Albums of All Time.\\" Javier Bl√°nquez and Omar Morena included the album in a list of 16 significant \\"encounters between electronica and pop music\\" between 1989‚Äì2002 in their 2002 book Loops, a History of Electronic Music. The Vinyl Factory included the album in its 2015 list \\"Storm Static Sleep: The Evolution of Post-Rock in 12 Records,\\" saying \\"D. I. Go Pop was a protest against those utopian, vacuum- sealed bubbles of radio pop, in which only real instruments and complimentary harmonies were permitted to thrive. This is the sound of music fighting against the flux of the real world. [...] If there‚Äôs any justice, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before D. I. Go Pop acquires the widespread recognition it deserves.\\" Treble included the album in its 2013 list of \\"10 Essential Post- Rock Albums,\\" saying that, \\"heavily incorporating samples amid dense and dreamy melodies, D.

Manley currently draws two syndicated comic strips, Judge Parker and The Phantom. He is also known for co-creating the Marvel Comics character Darkhawk. Personal life Manley was born in Detroit, Michigan. Manley's grandfather was a commercial artist, and Manley was therefore aware as a child that one could make a living at drawing. He says he always liked comics and cartooning, and recalls being impressed when The Wonderful World of Disney showed the [animation] artists working behind the scenes. As a youth in Michigan, Manley visited a comic book store every day after school, and became a serious collector and reader. By the time he was a teenager, Manley had decided he wanted to be a comic book artist or animator or illustrator. \\"Frank Frazetta seemed to be able to do everything, so he was my role model,\\" Manley said. \\"How could you escape him, he so influenced the art world that you would still get influenced by him through other artists who were influenced by him even if somehow you never knew his art.\\" A commercial art class in high school in Ann Arbor enabled Manley to assemble a portfolio, which led to his start in commercial printing at age fifteen. He attended Washtenaw Community College, but found the art education he was receiving there to be unsatisfying. At age twenty-one, Manley began working for the Detroit Metro Times as art director. Two years after, he had his first comic book art assignment at DC Comics. He cites other artists in addition to Frazetta as inspiration: Alex Raymond, Stan Drake, Leonard Starr, John Prentice, and Al Williamson. In his late twenties, Manley would have the opportunity to work for a brief but intensely formative time alongside Williamson, in that artist's Honesdale, PA studio. Manley lives in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania just outside Philadelphia. CareerComic book artist= Mike Manley has worked as an artist for major publishers such as Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and Dark Horse Comics. Manley, with writers Danny Fingeroth and Tom DeFalco, co-created in 1991 the Darkhawk series, which he drew for the first half of its run. He has also contributed to other comic book titles such as Batman, Quasar, Captain America, Marvel Universe, and The Power of Shazam!. His extensive bibliography in comic books includes a large number of short runs and fill-in issues on a wide variety of titles. In his run on the Batman series, Manley was one of the artists of Batman #500 in which the character Azrael replaced Bruce Wayne as Batman.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 260: \\"By Batman #500, the last chapter of the 'Knightfall' saga by writer Doug Moench and artist Jim Aparo and Mike Manley, Azrael was truly his own [version of] Batman.\\" He drew the series during the \\"KnightsEnd\\" storyline and the Zero Hour: Crisis in Time crossover.Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dougall, p. 208: \\"In this issue [#0] by writer Doug Moench and Mike Manley, Bruce's life was recalled.\\" In 1995, Manley formed Action Planet Inc. as a home to publish his own comics and ideas, starting with the anthology Action Planet Comics, featuring his character Monsterman. In early 1996 he founded ActionPlanet.com, which has grown to include his award-winning on-line web comic, G.I.R.L. Patrol. In 2007, while primarily working as an art teacher, Manley illustrated a new Secret Agent Corrigan story for the Swedish publisher Egmont Publishing (Manley's mentor Al Williamson had famously drawn the character's syndicated strip). =Book illustrator= Concurrently with some of his time at Marvel Comics, between 1985-1990, Manley illustrated children's books utilizing licensed characters. For Macmillan Publishing, he illustrated books in their Raggedy Ann and Andy series. For Golden Books and Western Publishing he worked on several children's fun and activity books, with Barbie, He-Man, Captain Power, Tiny Toons, Ghost Busters and the Muppets as some of the characters featured. In 1989 Manley worked for West End Games on role-playing game books in the Star Wars line. =Animation artist= In 1996 Manley moved into the animation field, first working as a storyboard artist on Superman: The Animated Series for Kids' WB. The first of the seven episodes that included his work featured Lobo, and was titled \\"The Main Man, Part 2\\". Manley also worked on the storyboards team for three episodes of The New Batman Adventures between 1997 and 1998. Throughout the 2000s, Manley created storyboards as a freelance artist on TV cartoons such as: Samurai Jack (on which series he also received two writing credits); Kim Possible; The Fairly OddParents; The Venture Brothers; Growing Up Creepie; and The Secret Saturdays. Other projects in this period included: Spy Groove for MTV; Spawn for HBO; ABC's One Saturday Morning; Clerks: The Animated Series, based on the Kevin Smith movie; and Justice League: The New Frontier. Between 1998 and 2001, Manley was a background key designer for Superman: The Animated Series (nine episodes, following his time as a storyboard artist on that series), and background key designer then background designer on Batman Beyond (thirty-three episodes overall). He is also credited as character designer on eight episodes of Batman: The Brave and the Bold between 2008 and 2009. =Art teacher= While working in both comics and animation, Manley created and edited Draw! Magazine, a twice Eisner-nominated \\"how-to\\" magazine published by TwoMorrows Publishing. The magazine features step-by-step demos and articles on artists working in comics, cartooning, and animation. Manley also co-produced a how-to DVD along with Danny Fingeroth, How to Create Comics from Script to Print, also distributed by TwoMorrows. In 2000, Manley started a new career as an art teacher. He taught in the animation department at the Delaware College of Art and Design (DCAD) until 2009 and became a senior lecturer at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. Manley then enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, finishing his certificate in painting on his way toward completing his master's degree. =Comic strip artist= Manley was hired to draw the serial newspaper comic strip Judge Parker for four weeks beginning March 15, 2010, filling in for regular artist Eduardo Barreto during an illness. The syndicate essentially held a \\"two-man tryout\\" for Barreto's replacement, with Manley's audition following John Heebink's; Manley was offered the full-time job after he turned in his second week of art for the strip. Manley and Heebink had known each other since high school. Manley draws the strip for all seven days of the week. In late March 2016, it was announced that Manley would succeed Paul Ryan, who had died unexpectedly, as artist on The Phantom daily strips (the Sundays would continue to be drawn by the incumbent, Terry Beatty). Manley's tenure began with the strip dated May 30, 2016. Manley noted that he and Paul Ryan are numbered among a small and notable group of artists who have professionally drawn the adventures of both Batman and The Phantom. The others have been Jim Aparo, Terry Beatty, Don Newton, Carmine Infantino (as a ghost for Sy Barry), Joe Giella (ghosting for Bob Kane) and Graham Nolan. The choice of Manley to take on the Phantom received a meandering endorsement from Comic Strip of the Day.com: \\"He's one of the few who has found a way to maintain some detail in an ever-shrinking print medium that has driven most artists to a simplified style that works better in shrinky-dink mode than when the comics are read on line, at least on a real computer with a real monitor.\\" BibliographyDark Horse Comics= * Aliens Vs.

She has published several books of short stories and her first novel was published in 2014. She is a leading figure of the Fr√§uleinwunder (\\"girl wonder\\") of women writers.  Life  Hermann was born in St. Joseph's hospital in West Berlin. She grew up in the West Berlin neighborhood of Neuk√∂lln and remained there until the mid- nineties, when she moved to the district of Prenzlauer Berg in the former East Berlin. She holds a master's degree in German and Philosophy and attended the Berliner Journalistenschule, a highly selective professional academy for journalists. During this training she did an internship with the German language newspaper Aufbau in New York. While she was in America she worked on some of her first literary texts and realized that short stories were \\"her\\" genre. In an interview she explained that her training as a journalist helped her to write concisely, although she knew that journalism was not suitable for her.Interview on 18/06/09 in Freiburg (Germany) during a lecture of her book Alice. After returning to Berlin, she worked briefly as a free-lance journalist before she was awarded the Alfred-D√∂blin stipend from the Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1997. Recipients of this stipend are financed for three to twelve months while they live and work in the Alfred-D√∂blin House in Wewelsfleth. In 1998 her first volume of short stories, Sommerhaus, sp√§ter, was celebrated by critics, who felt they had discovered in her work the \\"sound of a new generation\\" (Spiegel 12/1999). Hermann quickly became a leading figure of the Fr√§uleinwunder (\\"miracle of the young women\\"), a term coined by German literary critic Volker Hage of Spiegel that grouped together female authors like Jenny Erpenbeck, Felicitas Hoppe, Zoe Jenny, Juli Zeh and Julia Franck who were gaining success at the time. Although \\"Fr√§ulein\\" is an old fashioned term, not politically correct, and rejected by the authors themselves, the term worked well as a marketing tool and has been adopted in Literary Criticism.http://www.uni- goettingen.de/de/document/.../ExposeBlumenkamp.pdf Judith Hermann received both the Hugo Ball Prize and the Bremer Literatur-F√∂rderpreis. In 2001 she was awarded the Kleist Prize. Her second collection of stories, Nichts als Gespenster, followed in 2003, but to some extent was unable to fulfill the high expectations of critics. In 2009, her latest collection of short stories, Alice, was published. Alice comprises five connected stories about the death of five men, each story sharing a common protagonist, Alice. Iris Radisch, a famous critic for the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit titled her review of Hermann's book \\"Das gro√üe M√§nnersterben\\" (The death of many men).http://www.zeit.de/2009/19/L-Hermann Despite the melancholic subject, these stories are also about life must go on after death. In this respect, Alice is different from Hermann's earlier works, which had a much darker tone. Hermann's most recent work, her first novel Aller Liebe Anfang, was published in 2014. It depicts a stalking scenario, in which the protagonist Stella is terrorized by a neighbor, Mister Pfister, when she is alone in her home during the day while her husband and daughter are at work and school. Mister Pfister appears one day on Stella's doorstep, wishing to speak with her and, after being denied, becomes fixated on her, leaving increasingly encroaching and aggressive messages in her mailbox and threatening to destroy her quiet family life. Hermann's novel is chilling, in part because of the restrained language she employs and in part because the stalking scenario nods to contemporary social fears about security and vulnerability.

He ruled from AD 755 until 797 or 804. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet and the establishment of the Nyingma or \\"Ancient\\" school of Tibetan Buddhism. The empire Trisong Detsen inherited had declined somewhat from its greatest extent under the first Dharma King, Songtsen Gampo. Disintegration continued when, in 694, Tibet lost control of several cities in Turkestan and, in 703, Nepal broke into rebellion. Meanwhile, Arab forces vied for influence along the western border lands of the Tibetan empire. Trisong Detsen and his support for Buddhism Trisong Detsen is very important to the history of Tibetan Buddhism as one of the three 'Dharma Kings' (Tibetan:ch√∂gyel) who established Buddhism in Tibet. The Three Dharma Kings were Songtsen Gampo, Trisong Detsen, and Ralpacan. The Skar-cung pillar erected by Sadnalegs (ruled c. 800-815) says that during the reign of Trisong Detsen, \\"shrines of the Three Jewels were established by building temples at the centre and on the borders, Bsam-yas in Brag-mar and so on\\".Richardson, Hugh. A Corpus of Early Tibetan Inscriptions (1981), p. 75. Royal Asiatic Society, London. . The first edict of Trisong Detsen already mentions a community of monks at Bsam-yas (Samye), consisting of the former army.Beckwith, C. I. \\"The Revolt of 755 in Tibet\\", p. 3 note 7.

Proceedings of the Csoma de K≈ër√∂s Symposium Held at Velm-Vienna, Austria, 13‚Äì19 September 1981. Vols. 1-2.] Vienna, 1983. =Indian traditions= Trisong became emperor in 755 and, in post-imperial sources, is claimed to have invited Padmasambhava, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita, Vimalamitra, and various other Indian teachers to come to Tibet to spread the latest understanding of the teaching. The two pandits began by establishing Samye as the first vihara in Tibet. Several Tibetans were eventually initiated as monks and a vast translation project was undertaken translating the Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Classical Tibetan.Stein, R. A. (1972) Tibetan Civilization, p. 66. Stanford University Press. (cloth); (pbk) Yeshe Tsogyal, previously either the consort or wife of Trisong Detsen, became a great master after studying with Padmasambhava, and is considered the Mother of Buddhism. =Chinese traditions= The first documented dissemination of Chan Buddhism to Tibet, chronicled in what has become known as the Statements of the Sba Family, occurred in about 761 when Trisong Detsen sent a party to the Yizhou region to receive the teachings of Kim Hwasang, a Korean Chan master, who they encountered in Sichuan. The party received teachings and three Chinese texts from Kim, who died soon after.Ray, Gary L.(2005). The Northern Ch'an School and Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates in China and Tibet. Source: (accessed: December 2, 2007) Trisong Detsen patronised a second party to China in 763. This second expedition was headed by a high minister, Sba Gsalsnan. There is scholarly dissent about whom Gsalsnan encountered in Yizhou. Early scholarship considered Kim, but this had been revised to Baotang Wuzhu (714-774), head and founder of Baotang Monastery in Chengdu. Both Kim and Baotang Wuzhu were of the same school of Chan, the East Mountain Teaching. Debates Trisong Detsen, hosted a famous two-year debate from 792-794, known in Western scholarship as the \\"Council of Lhasa\\" (although it took place at Samye at quite a distance from Lhasa) outside the capital. He sponsored a Dharma debate between the Chan Buddhist Moheyan, who represented the third documented wave of Chan dissemination in Tibet, and the scholar Kamala≈õƒ´la, a student of ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita. Effectively the debate was between the Chinese and Indian Buddhist traditions as they were represented in Tibet. Sources differ about both the nature of the debate as well as the victor. Stein (1972: p. 66-67) holds that Kamala≈õƒ´la disseminated a \\"gradualist approach\\" to enlightenment, consisting of purificatory sƒÅdhanƒÅ such as cultivating the pƒÅramitƒÅs. Kamalashila's role was to ordain Tibetans as Buddhist monks and propagate Buddhist philosophy as it had flourished in India. Stein (1972: p. 66-67) holds that Kamala≈õƒ´la was victorious in the debate and that Trisong Dets√§n sided with Kamala≈õƒ´la.Stein, R. A. (1972) Tibetan Civilization, pp. 66-67.

During the reign of Trisong Dets√§n the combined efforts of Padmasambhava, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita and Kamala≈õƒ´la established both the Indian Buddhist philosophical interpretation and Buddhist tantra in Tibet. Political and military activities In 763 Trisong Detsen sent an army of 200,000 men to the border with Tang China, defeating the forces there and then continuing on to take Chang'an, the Tang Chinese capital, forcing Emperor Daizong of Tang to flee the capital.Stein, R. A. (1972) Tibetan Civilization, p. 65. Stanford University Press. (cloth); (pbk) In 783 a peace treaty was negotiated between China and Tibet giving Tibet all lands in present-day Qinghai. The Tang Empire had declined greatly due to the An Lushan Rebellion which was finally quelled in 763. The King also formed an alliance with Nanzhao in 778, joining forces to attack the Chinese in Sichuan. Trisong Detsen next sought to expand westward, reaching the Amu Darya and threatening the Abbasid Caliph, Harun ar-Rashid. The Caliph was concerned enough to establish an alliance with the Chinese emperor. King Trisong Detsen would be preoccupied with Arab wars in the west, taking pressure off his Chinese opponents to the east and north, until his rule ended in 797. Retirement, death and succession Trisong Detsen had four sons: Mutri Tsenpo, Mun√© Tsenpo, Mutik Tsenpo, and Sadnalegs. The eldest son, Mutri Tsenpo, died early. Trisong Detsen retired to live at the palace at Zungkar and handed power to his second son, Mun√© Tsenpo, in 797. From this point there is much confusion in the various historical sources. It seems there was a struggle for the succession after the death of Trisong Detsen. It is not clear when Trisong Detsen died, or for how long Mune Tsenpo reigned. The Testament of Ba, a Tibetan historical text which may date back to the 9th century, claims that Mun√© Tsenpo insisted that his father's funeral be performed according to Buddhist rather than traditional rites.dBa' bzhed: The Royal Narrative Concerning the Bringing of the Buddha's Doctrine to Tibet.

She is most famous for her duel with the British frigate on 17 June 1778, which began the French involvement in the American War of Independence. 1768 ‚Äì 1777 Belle Poule was built in Bordeaux between March 1765 and early 1767. She served in two campaigns in the West Indies, where due to her good sailing performance she was selected for the first French attempt at covering her hull with copper to resist marine growths. From 1772 to 1776, she was sent on hydrographic missions, during which the young La P√©rouse came to the attention of his superiors. On 12 December 1776, she left India to return to Brest. At the time, France was not yet engaged in the American War of Independence, but there had been numerous incidents involving French and British ships. Indeed, on 27 April 1777, Belle Poule was chased by a British ship of the line, which she easily evaded to reach Brest. In December 1777, Belle Poule was selected to ferry Silas Deane back to America, along with news of the French-American Alliance.Ferreiro, p.97 1778 ‚Äì 1801 A painting by Auguste-Louis de Rossel de Cercy depicting the fight of Belle Poule and Arethusa On 7 January, the British ships of the line and stopped her and demanded to inspect her. In spite of the overwhelming superiority of the British forces, her captain, Charles de Bernard de Marigny, answered: The British offered apologies and let the frigate sail through. However, opposing winds prevented the ship from crossing the Atlantic, and after 36 days, Belle Poule had to return to Brest. Franklin later sailed to America aboard Sensible. =Fight of Belle Poule and Arethusa= When war broke out, Belle Poule was sent on a reconnaissance mission, along with the 26-gun frigate , the corvette , and the smaller Coureur, to locate the squadron of Admiral Keppel. They encountered the British squadron, which chased them. Coiffure Belle-Poule caught up with the French and a furious battle ensued. Eventually, Arethusa had to break off the fight, having lost her main mast. The British captured the smaller French ships, but the two frigates escaped the numerous ships of the line pursuing them. Belle Poule lost 30 killed and 72 wounded, among which her captain, Lieutenant Jean Isaac Chadeau de la Clocheterie. Arethusa had eight men killed and 36 wounded. The battle was so famous that ladies of the high society invented the hairstyle \\"Belle Poule\\", with a ship on the top of the head. Between September and October 1778, Belle Poule teamed up with French ship Vengeur and captured five privateers. In 1779, Belle Poule served as coast guard and convoy escort. Capture On the evening of 14 July 1780 Captain Sir James Wallace of the 64-gun ship of the line was off the Loire where her boats were burning the French frigate Legere. He observed three vessels to the north west, signalling each other and immediately gave chase. At about midnight Nonsuch caught up with one of the three off √éle d'Yeu and commenced a two-hour action. When the French vessel struck she turned out to be Belle Poule. She was armed with thirty-two 12-pounder guns, had a crew of 275 men and was under the command of Chevalier Kergariou-Coatl√®s.Levot, p.257 In the engagement Belle Poule lost 25 men killed, including Kergariou, and 50 other officers and men, including her second captain, wounded. Nonsuch had lost three men killed and ten wounded, two of whom died later. The two French vessels that escaped were the frigate Aimable, of thirty-two 8-pounder guns, and the corvette Rossignol, of twenty 6-pounder guns.

Calonne was only two years old, a fast sailer, and well equipped for a voyage of three months and a crew of 200 men. She was armed with twenty-two 9-pounder guns, six 4-pounder guns and six 12-pounder carronades. Belle Poule participated in the 1781 battle of Dogger Bank. Hollandia, one of the Dutch ships-of-the-line, sank after the battle. Belle Poule took away her flag, which was kept flying, and carried it to Admiral Parker.Allen, p.319.

The height of the mountain was in 1909, but now the height of the mountain is . It is the highest mountain in the Indochinese Peninsula (comprising Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia), hence its nickname \\"the Roof of Indochina\\". It is located in the L√†o Cai Province of the Northwest region of Vietnam, 9 km southwest of Sa Pa in the Hoang Lien Son mountain range. Administratively, it is shared between Tam ƒê∆∞·ªùng district, Lai Ch√¢u and Sa Pa town, L√†o Cai. Etymology View from Fansipan The origin of the name Phan Xi PƒÉng is unclear. The most accepted theory is that the name evolved from H·ªßa Xi Pan (the tottering giant rock) - the name that the locals called the mountain based on its shape. Another theory suggested that the name came from Hmong people as the name means Azalea Mountain in their language due to the prevalence of azalea and other species of Rhododendron genus on the mountain. It has also been suggested that the name could have derived from Phan VƒÉn S∆°n, a geography official in the Nguyen dynasty who helped the French to map the area and define the border with China in 1905. Due to the inaccurate local pronunciation, the name generally evolved into Phan Xi PƒÉng. Geography Fansipan is the tallest mountain in the Hoang Lien Son Range, situated on the border of Lao Cai Province and Lai Chau Province with its peak located on Lao Cai side. The mountain is part of the Ho√†ng Li√™n National Park. It has a topographic prominence of , ranking 6th in Vietnam. Geology Fansipan was formed around 250‚Äì260 million years ago, between the Permian period in the Paleozoic era and the Triassic period in the Mesozoic era. The Himalayan orogeny since Late Mesozoic has further uplifted Fansipan and the Hoang Lien Son Range and created the Red River Fault to the east.  Summit mark  The initial metal pyramid was made and installed here by Soviet engineers from H√≤a B√¨nh in 1985. The amateur mountaineering expedition was the first one since the end of the colonial period and was officially timed to the 40th anniversary of the Victory Day of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany.  Climbing Hiking= Fansipan can be climbed in a steep and fairly strenuous hike. Previously, it would take about 5‚Äì6 days from Sa Pa to reach Fansipan peak and return. Now the total time is usually only about 3 days, even 2 days, or for experts and strong, healthy people, it can be done in one day. Tour companies in the area will arrange hikes to the summit taking from one to three days.

Born in Wolseley, Saskatchewan, he received a B.A. in economics from the University of Saskatchewan in 1939. He won a scholarship to Clark University where he obtained his M.A. in 1941 and he received a Ph.D. in 1952 from the University of Minnesota. He taught economics at the University of Manitoba from 1949 to 1982 and served as head of the department from 1963 to 1972. Barber also taught at McMaster University, Queen's University, McGill University, and the University of Victoria. His professional interests included macroeconomic theory, international economics, and monetary theory. Barber's best known theoretical contribution was his formulation of the concept of the effective rate of protection. Effects of the Great Depression in his youth motivated Barber to study economics . In 1978, Barber wrote \\"On the Causes of the Great Depression\\" where he made a link between demographics and economics. He cited how demand for housing in the U.S. began to drop beginning in 1926. Early in 1929, demand for housing dropped precipitously. The stock market crash in October of that same year was preceded by a decline in demand, Barber argues, that began with a lower formation of households concomitant with lower rates of marriage. After World War I, a birth dearth had resulted; a dearth that demographers have shown did not end until World War II ended. (see Causes of the Great Depression) The death of young men as soldiers in World War I, coupled with the Flu Pandemic of 1918 wrought their eventual harm to the economy as a whole. The increase in secularization during the 'Roaring Twenties', as automobiles became widespread, and availability of electricity and electrical appliances and such, may have had its effect too. Barber showed in \\"On Causes...\\" that lower demand for mortgages and other loans preceded by some years a shortage of loan availability as the Great Depression deepened towards 1933. After the Winnipeg flood of 1950, he was economic adviser and director of research for the Manitoba Royal Commission Flood Cost-Benefit from 1957 to 1959. The result of which led to the construction of the Red River Floodway. In 1987, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2001, he was awarded the Order of Manitoba. In 1947, he married Barbara Anne Patchet. They had four children: Paul, Stephen, David, and Alan. From 1982 to 1985 Clarence served on the Royal Commission on Economic Union and Development Prospects For Canada, more commonly known as the Macdonald Commission. It was on this commission where he argued for free trade with the United States.

Structure The Internal Security Act 1960 was consisted of 4 Parts containing 85 sections and 3 schedules (including 21 amendments). * Part I: Preliminary * Part II: General Provisions Relating to Internal Security ** Chapter I: Prohibition of Organizations and Associations of a Political or Quasi-Military Character and Uniforms, etc. ** Chapter II: Powers of Preventive Detention ** Chapter III: Special Powers Relating to Subversive Publications, etc. ** Chapter IV: Control of Entertainments and Exhibitions ** Chapter V: Other Powers for the Prevention of Subversion ** Chapter VI: Miscellaneous * Part III: Special Provisions Relationg to Security Areas ** Chapter I: Proclamation of Security Areas ** Chapter II: Powers Relating to Preservation of Public Security ** Chapter III: Offences Relating to Security Areas ** Chapter IV: Powers of Police and others ** Chapter V: General ** Chapter VI: Power to make Regulations * Part IV: Miscellaneous Provisions * Schedules History Preventive detention was first implemented in Malaya by the British in 1948 to combat the armed insurgency of the Malayan Communist Party during the Malayan Emergency. The Emergency Regulations Ordinance 1948 was enacted by the British High Commissioner Sir Edward Gent. It allowed the detention of persons for a period not exceeding one year. This ordinance targeted acts of violence and only imposed temporary detention. The Malayan Emergency ended in 1960 and the ordinance was repealed. However, preventive detention was retained and remains a feature of Malaysian law today. In 1960, the government passed the Internal Security Act (ISA) under the authority granted by Article 149 the Malaysian Constitution. The stated purpose of the ISA was to deter communist activity in Malaysia during the Malayan Emergency and afterwards. The first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, defined the purpose of the act as to \\"be used solely against the communists...My Cabinet colleagues and I gave a solemn promise to Parliament and the nation that the immense powers given to the government under the ISA would never be used to stifle legitimate opposition and silence lawful dissent\\". The third Prime Minister, Tun Hussein Onn, stated at the same time that his administration had enforced the act only with a view to curbing communist activity, and not to repress \\"lawful political opposition and democratic citizen activity\\".Saravanamuttu, Johan. \\"REPORT ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN MALAYSIA\\". Retrieved 16 October 2006. In response to criticism that the ISA was not democratic or was too open to abuse, the first internal security minister, Ismail Abdul Rahman, stated: However, partly due to massive street protests involving the public and politicians from both sides which portrayed the ISA as draconian and unnecessary in view of Malaysia's progress to \\"developed nation\\" status, on 15 September 2011, Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that The Internal Security Act will be abolished. Two new laws will be introduced instead to safeguard peace and order. Reform The government is in the final stages of revising the Internal Security Act. Home Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein has stated that ISA amendments will revolve around five areas ‚Äì the length of detention, rights and treatment of detainees and their families, the power of the Home Minister, the use of ISA for political reasons and detention without trial. In revising the ISA, the government met with key stakeholders to discuss amendments. Hishammuddin and Home Ministry's officials met for about three hours with representatives from the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Bar Council, the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club, the National Council for Women's Organisations and the National Civics Bureau. The Home Minister said that during the discussions, all parties agreed that there should be a law in place to protect the people against terrorism and militancy. The Law Reform Committee set up to review detentions under the Internal Security Act (ISA) has submitted its amendment proposals to the Cabinet. Parliament is expected to conclude its review of the amendments during its current sitting. Law Graffito in Kuala Lumpur advocating abolition of the Internal Security Act. Some notable sections of the legislation include: Section 73(1) Internal Security Act 1960: \\"Any police officer may without warrant arrest and detain pending enquiries any person in respect of whom he has reason to believe that there are grounds which would justify his detention under section 8; and that he has acted or is about to act or is likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or any part thereof or to maintenance of essential services therein or to the economic life thereof.\\" Section 8 ISA: Power to order detention or restriction of persons. \\"(i) If the Minister is satisfied that the detention of any person is necessary with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or any part thereof or to the maintenance of essential services therein or the economic life thereof, he may make an order (hereinafter referred to as a detention order) directing that that person be detained for any period not exceeding two years.\\" Section 8(1) theoretically restricts detention to a period not exceeding two years but this limit is readily circumvented because under Section 8(7), the duration of the detention order may be extended indefinitely in increments of up to two years The extension of the detention order may be made on the same grounds as those on which the original order was based or on different grounds. In delivering the judgment of the Court, Steve L.K. Shim CJ (Sabah & Sarawak) in Kerajaan Malaysia & 2 Ors. v Nasharuddin bin Nasir (2003) 6 AMR 497 at page 506, ruled that the powers extended to the Home Minister are valid under the Malaysian Constitution. In addition, preventive detention is also now allowed by the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act 1985 and the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM) has recently recommended that the ISA be repealed and replaced by new comprehensive legislation that, while taking a tough stand on threats to national security (including terrorism), does not violate basic human rights. A detenu can make representations against his/her detention if an order of detention has been made against the detenu by the Minister under Section 8(1) of the ISA but under Section 73 however, the detenu seems to have no such right. Generally, the attitude of the Malaysian courts in respect of detention under Section 73 is that the courts have jurisdiction only in regard to any question on compliance with the procedural requirements of the ISA and they seldom grant any substantive rights to the detenu. Article 151 of the Malaysian Constitution gives to any person detained without trial (under the special powers against subversion) certain administrative rights. By the terms of Article 151 the authority, on whose order a person is detained, shall, as soon as may be, inform the detainee of the grounds of detention and the allegations of fact on which the order is based. The detainee shall also be given an opportunity within three months, of making representations against the order to an Advisory Board . The Advisory Board as the name implies is not a court. Its determinations are also mere recommendations that the government is under no obligation to accept. It may also be handicapped in its deliberations by the discretionary power of the government to withhold facts, the disclosure of which would, in the executive‚Äôs opinion be against national interest. Any person may be detained by the police for up to 60 days without trial for an act which allegedly threatens the security of the country or any part thereof. After 60 days, one may be further detained for a period of two years each, to be approved by the Minister of Home Affairs, thus permitting indefinite detention without trial. In 1989, the powers of the Minister under the legislation was made immune to judicial review by virtue of amendments to the Act, only allowing the courts to examine and review technical matters pertaining to the ISA arrest. The Reid Commission ‚ÄòAnti-government‚Äô has at times been simply equated to being ‚Äòanti-national‚Äô. In their Report, the Reid Commission (that was entrusted with the job of drafting the Merdeka Constitution) mentioned that the rights they were recommending had already been firmly established throughout Malaya and the guarantee of the fundamental rights would be provided by the mechanisms of: the Constitution being the supreme law; ‚Äòthe power and duty of the Courts to enforce these rights‚Äô; and, ‚Äòthe Courts would annul any attempt to subvert any of them whether by legislative or administrative action or otherwise‚Äô. [See Chapter IX, Fundamental Rights: Constitutional Guarantees, Para 161 p. 70 of the Report.] Hardial Singh Khaira [Is it the ISA per se or the Interpretations Given by the Judiciary that Makes it Such a Draconian Law Now?], in his analysis of judgments related to the ISA maintains that 'not only have the Malaysian courts failed to annul the encroachments on the fundamental rights but their lack of judicial activism has in fact subverted those rights further. The failure of the Malaysian courts in relation to the ISA starts with the fact that they have generally accepted the subjective satisfaction of the executive for justifying the detention of an individual.' He further adds that the 'current approach of the Malaysian courts only serves to reduce executive accountability and respect for human rights under the rule of law.' Release Although the government may release detainees unconditionally, in some cases, it has required those being released to make a public confession on television and radio.Tan, Chee Koon & Vasil, Raj (ed., 1984). Without Fear or Favour, p. 27. Eastern Universities Press. . The case of Raja Petra Kamarudin, a well known blogger of Malaysia Today website, detained under the Internal Security Act on 12 September 2008 and was subsequently released 56 days later, was due to the habeas corpus filed by his lawyer citing unlawful detention by the Home Ministry. The High court, on 7 November 2008, over-ruled that detention and he was set free on the same day. Criticism Due to the alleged draconian nature of the ISA, several human rights organisations and opposition political parties have strongly criticised the act and called for its repeal. Foreign governments, notably that of the United States, have also pressured the government to repeal the act. After the promise to repeal the ISA made in September 2011, there was nonetheless cynicism about the timing and delay of the repeal. =Domestic= Several opposition parties such as the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), the Democratic Action Party (DAP) and Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) have spoken out against the ISA. Many of them have leaders or prominent members who were held under the ISA, such as Mohamad Sabu of PAS, Lim Kit Siang, Karpal Singh and Lim Guan Eng of the DAP, and Anwar Ibrahim of the PKR. Previously in the 1960s, the law had been denounced by such opposition leaders as Tan Chee Khoon, who said: However, several politicians from the Barisan Nasional coalition, including its largest component party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO or Umno), that has governed Malaysia since independence have also criticised the ISA. The fifth Prime Minister of Malaysia, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, went on the record in 1988 to state \\"If we want to save Malaysia and Umno, Dr Mahathir (then Prime Minister) must be removed. He uses draconian laws such as the Internal Security Act to silence his critics.\\" The year before, he had also stated \\"Laws such as the Internal Security Act have no place in modern Malaysia. It is a draconian and barbaric law.\\" In 2003 when he became Prime Minister, however, Abdullah called the ISA \\"a necessary law,\\" and argued \\"We have never misused the Internal Security Act. All those detained under the Internal Security Act are proven threats to society.\\" But opposition parties believe it is a threat to Umno rather than a threat to the country. Prior to becoming Prime Minister, Mahathir had also adhered to a critical view of the ISA. In 1966, when Mahathir spoke out in support of the Internal Security (Amendment) Bill 1966 as a backbencher, he stated that \\"no one in his right senses like[s] the ISA. It is in fact a negation of all the principles of democracy.\\" After becoming Prime Minister however the former premier had little if any hesitation using the law to suppress what he termed racialism but was seen by some as a move against his political opponents, the most notable of events being the infamous Operasi Lalang in 1987. Recently former rapporteur to the United Nations Param Cumaraswamy, who is on record for his opposition of the ISA, suggested its use on former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir for alleged racial incitement by the latter at a speech in Johor Bahru on 17 May 2008, arguing that the reasoning of the former premier in the use of the law would be applicable against him now in light of his own racial excesses Such tit for tat justification however was condemned by various groups, notably PAS for inconsistency and double standards shown by the former rapporteur in his position as regards the ISA.HarakahDaily.Net ‚Äì PAS Batu kecam cadangan Param tahan Mahathir bawah ISA In Kota Kinabalu, United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO) led by its Secretary- General Datuk Wilfred Madius Tangau, on 23 September 2008, joined its 3 other Barisan Nasional (BN) counterparts MCA, Gerakan and MIC, petitioning Government review of ISA. Madius said the party supports former de facto Law Minister Datuk Zaid Ibrahim's position that the ISA should only be used against those who posed a threat to national security, such as terrorists: \\"Clearly in the case of Seputeh MP, Teresa Kok, Raja Petra Kamaruddin, and Sin Chew Daily reporter, Tan Hoon Cheng, there are so many other public order laws that can be used against them if, at all, there is a case to do so.\\" Notable uses of the ISA Since 1960 when the Act was enacted, thousands of people including trade unionists, student leaders, labour activists, political activists, religious groups, academicians, NGO activists have been arrested under the ISA. Many political activists in the past have been detained for more than a decade. As of 2005, 10,662 people have been arrested under the ISA in the previous 44 years, 4,139 were issued with formal detention orders and 2,066 were served with restriction orders governing their activities and where they live. In addition, 12 people were executed for offences under the ISA between 1984 and 1993. Source: Figures were provided in a written answer by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is also Minister for Internal Security, to parliamentary opposition leader Lim Kit Siang, whose statement was quoted by AFP in newsreports dated 3 February 2005 The ISA has been consistently used against people who criticise the government and defend human rights. Known as the \\"white terror\\", it has been the most feared and despised, yet convenient tool for the state to suppress opposition and open debate. The Act is seen by some as an instrument maintained by the ruling government to control public life and civil society. The ISA was used extensively during the 1987 Operation Lalang in which Opposition members were silenced by the UMNO government through the use of ISA. Many opposition leaders were detained and the ISA was also used to detain Anwar Ibrahim. The ISA was also used against militants. In August 2011, 3 Indian nationals who were members of the Babbar Khalsa International were arrested and deported. A Jemaah Islamiah member arrested in 2009 under the ISA was deported to Indonesia. One of the most recent application of ISA was against Hindu activists belonging to the group HINDRAF who voiced out against the government policies that resulted in Malaysian Indians being marginalised and sidelined from the country's development. In response, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi personally signed the detention order that allows the leaders of HINDRAF to be detained without trial for two years, with the option for the detention order to be renewed indefinitely. The government of Prime Minister Najib Razak has used the similar Emergency Ordinance on several occasions. Repeal Prime Minister Najib Razak first announced the proposed repeal of the ISA on 15 September 2011 when he claimed that the repeal was made \\"to accommodate and realise a mature, modern and functioning democracy; to preserve public order; enhance civil liberty and maintain racial harmony.\\" The ISA is to be repealed and replaced by the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 which was passed and given the royal assent on 18 June 2012 but is not yet in force as of July 2012 as it is still waiting for the date of commencement to be announced by the Minister of Home Affairs, Hishammuddin Hussein. On 9 July 2012, Najib Razak was reported to have said that the ISA was scrapped because it did not help the ruling government politically.

It has about 12,000 inhabitants. There is developed production of glass artifacts, small precision motors and, increasingly, tourism. History The town is placed between Lusatian Mountains and Central Bohemian Uplands. First written document mentions this place in 1471 as village Arnsdorff (Arnultovice). During 17th and 18th century it slowly grew into small town. In 1757 it got elevated into status of town, which was called Haida. In 1783 engineer Emanuel Kleinw√§chter had created plan for the new town with many gardens. Since end of 18th century Nov√Ω Bor became known for its large glass industry (as happened in the whole region). From 1938 to 1945 it was one of the municipalities in Sudetenland. Climate The town is located on the edge of a mountainous region, which influences the local climate. Average annual temperatures vary from 5 to 7 ¬∞C and the annual rainfall is also relatively high at 800 to 1000 mm. The area gets a fair bit of snow in the winter, especially north of the town, in the mountains, making it a popular destination for cross country and downhill skiing. Large parts of the area are covered with forests, unfortunately the original mixed deciduous forests have been largely replaced with evergreen pine monocultures over the last few hundred years. Attractions The town is sought after for its natural scenery and extensive forests in summer as well as winter. Hiking, cycling and cross-country skiing in the winter are made pleasant by many well marked tourist trails as well as many pubs, camps and B&B.; The town dominant is the mountain Kl√≠ƒç (759 m), offers panoramic views over a large part of Northern Bohemia, all the way to Germany and Poland on the North and Krkono≈°e mountains in the east to almost the outskirts of Prague in the south. The town is also the location of the regional Glass Museum,http://www.glassmuseum.eu/en/ a renovated baroque church from 1792 and many historical buildings. Hundreds of small glass factories in the surrounding picturesque villages offer tourists a chance to see the making of various glass products, often made to order on the spot. Economy The town is especially known for its glass production. Already in the year 1930 there were 68 companies, which conducted trade, production and ennoblement of glass.

In the late 1880s, Williams turned his interest to Europe and Africa. After having been impressed by meeting King Leopold II of Belgium, he traveled in 1890 to the Congo Free State (then owned by the king) to see its development. Shocked by the widespread, brutal abuses and slavery imposed on the Congolese, he wrote an open letter to Leopold in 1890 about the suffering of the region's native inhabitants at the hands of the king's agents. This letter was a catalyst for an international outcry against the regime running the Congo, which had caused millions of deaths.Hochschild, Adam, King Leopold's Ghost, Pan Macmillan, London (1998). , p. 102. Life and work George Washington Williams addressing the Ohio Legislature Williams was born free in 1849 in Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania, to two African Americans, Thomas and Ellen Rouse Williams. The state had abolished slavery after the American Revolution. He was the oldest of four children; his brothers were John, Thomas and Harry Lawsom Williams. The boys had limited educations. For a time Williams lived in a \\"house of refuge\\", where he learned barbering, considered a skilled and advantageous trade at the time. During the American Civil War, Williams ran away to enlist at the age of 14 in the Union Army under an assumed name; he fought during the final battles. After the war, Williams went to Mexico, where he was among Americans who joined the Republican Army under the command of General Espinosa, fighting to overthrow Emperor Maximilian. He was commissioned as a lieutenant, learned some Spanish, and earned a reputation as a good gunner. He returned to the U.S. in the spring of 1867. In the United States, Williams continued his military career, enlisting for a five-year stint in the Army. Assigned to the 10th Infantry, which served in the Indian Territory, he was wounded in a lung in 1868. Williams was hospitalized until his discharge that year.Berlin, Ira (August 15, 1999), \\"Soldier, Scholar, Statesman, Trickster\\" (review of new edition of John Hope Franklin's biography of George Washington Williams), The New York Times. Retrieved October 26, 2018. =Education= After returning to civilian life, the young veteran decided to attend college. He was accepted at Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, DC, but did not stay long. In 1870, Williams began studies at the Newton Theological Institution near Boston, Massachusetts. In 1874 Williams became the first African American to graduate from Newton. =Marriage and family= He met Sarah A. Sterrett during a visit to Chicago in 1873. They were married the following spring, when he graduated from Newton Theological. They had one son together. Career After graduation, Williams was ordained as a Baptist minister. He held several pastorates, including the historic Twelfth Baptist Church of Boston. Williams served a pastorate in Washington, DC. While there, with support from many of the leaders of his time, such as Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, Williams founded The Commoner, a weekly journal. (This had no relation to William Jennings Bryan's later publication of the same title). Williams published eight issues.Chronicling America, Library of Congress. Williams moved with his family to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he continued as a preacher. In addition, he studied law under Alphonso Taft (father of President William Howard Taft), reading the law with an established firm. He passed the bar. He became the first African American elected to the Ohio state legislature, serving one term from Cincinnati for 1880 to 1881. According to his biographer, historian John Hope Franklin, he offended his constituents by offering a bill that \\"threatened to deny members of a local African Methodist church the right to bury their dead in what was becoming an exclusive suburb\\" of the river city. Although the bill died in committee, Williams was not re-elected and his state political career abruptly ended. He turned to practicing law. Franklin noted Williams' ability to persist and pick up new endeavors after he had closed off some fields. =Nominated to state post= In the last weeks of his administration, President Chester A. Arthur nominated Williams as \\"Minister Resident and Consul General\\" to Haiti and Santo Domingo in early 1885, but he was not confirmed, as he was not considered qualified. Grover Cleveland, the president elected in 1884, nominated Democrat John E. W. Thompson to the positions soon after taking office in 1885. Thompson was confirmed by the Senate. In 1887, Williams was given an honorary doctorate of law by Simmons College of Kentucky, a historically black college, where he spoke at a commencement ceremony.[No Headline] Washington Bee (Washington, DC), June 4, 1887, p. 3. Retrieved November 8, 2016. In 1888 Thompson was a delegate to the World's Conference of Foreign Missions at London.Washington, T. Booker, The Story of the Negro: The Rise of the Race from Slavery. New York: Doubleday 1 (1909), pp. 324‚Äì325. Although he failed to gain entry as a delegate to an anti-slave trade conference in Brussels in the spring of 1890, he made other arrangements to visit the city and the continent. (See below) =Historian= Williams' most substantial achievement was as an historian. He wrote groundbreaking histories about African Americans in the United States: The History of the Negro Race in America 1619‚Äì1880 was published in 1882. It is considered to be the first overall history of African Americans, showing their participation and contributions from the earliest days of the colonies. In addition, he wrote a history of the United States Colored Troops and African-American participation in the American Civil War, A History of Negro Troops in the War of Rebellion (1887). =Travel to Europe and Africa= In 1889, Williams arranged to go to Europe to write articles as a representative of S. S. McClure's Associated Literary Press. He was granted an informal interview with King Leopold II of Belgium, with whom he was initially very impressed. He became interested in traveling in the Congo Free State, which the King personally owned and discussed his interest in developing. Williams got additional support from President Benjamin Harrison's administration and traveled to the Congo in 1890. He was appalled at what he found, as the King employed a private militia to enforce rubber production by the Congolese. Williams found evidence to support the widespread rumors of harsh abuses against workers and their families, that had resulted in a state of near slavery for many families, physical mutilation of workers who could not meet production goals, and a high rate of deaths. From Stanley Falls, Williams wrote \\"An Open Letter to His Serene Majesty Leopold II, King of the Belgians and Sovereign of the Independent State of Congo\\" on July 18, 1890. In this letter, he condemned the brutal and inhuman treatment of the Congolese at the hands of Europeans and Africans supervising them for the Congo Free State. He mentioned the role played by Henry M. Stanley, sent to the Congo by the King, in deceiving and mistreating local Congolese. Williams reminded the King that the crimes committed were all committed in his name, making him as guilty as the perpetrators. He appealed to the international community of the day to \\"call and create an International Commission to investigate the charges herein preferred in the name of Humanity ...\\". The King and his supporters tried to discredit Williams, but he continued to speak out about the abuses in the Congo Free State, helping to generate actions in Belgium and the international community. Eventually the Belgian government took over supervising the Congo Free State and tried to improve treatment of the Congolese. =Death in England= George Washington Williams' grave, Layton Cemetery, Blackpool, England While traveling back from Africa, Williams died in Blackpool, England, on August 2, 1891, from tuberculosis and pleurisy. He is buried in Layton Cemetery, Blackpool. In 1975 a tombstone was placed at his grave by an American historian and local supporters, commemorating Williams as an \\"Afro- American historian\\".

Its common names, Modjadji('s) cycad or Modjadji's palm, allude to the female dynasty of the Lobedu people, the Rain Queens, whose hereditary name is Modjadji. The queen resides near a valley (of late a nature reserve) which is densely forested with these cycads, which they protected and hold sacred. The species name transvenosus refers to the fine network of veins between the main veins. These can be seen when the leaf is held up to the light. Description The tree grows up to twelve metres tall with a thick trunk deeply scored in a netted pattern. This is crowned by nearly straight, shiny, spiny pinnate leaves up to two and a half metres long.

It provides an illustrated overview of the history and development of black hole theory, from its roots in Newtonian mechanics until the early 1990s. Overview Over fourteen chapters, Thorne proceeds roughly chronologically, tracing first the crisis in Newtonian physics precipitated by the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, and the subsequent development of Einstein's theory of special relativity (given mathematical rigor in the form of Minkowski space), and later Einstein's incorporation of gravity into the framework of general relativity. Black holes were quickly recognized as a feasible solution of Einstein's field equations, but were rejected as physically implausible by most physicists. Work by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar suggested that collapsing stars beyond a certain mass cannot be supported by degeneracy pressure, but this result was challenged by the more prestigious Arthur Stanley Eddington, and was not fully accepted for several decades. When the reality of objects which possess an event horizon finally achieved broad acceptance, the stage was set for a thorough investigation into the properties of such objects, yielding the surprising result that black holes have no hair‚Äîthat is, that their properties are entirely determined by their mass, spin rate, and electrical charge. Proceeding separately from theoretical research into relativity, and with the refinement of radio astronomy, astrophysics began to produce unusual observations of extremely intense radio sources, which were apparently located outside of the Milky Way. In consultation with theoretical physicists, it became apparent that the only sensible explanation for these sources were extremely large black holes residing in the cores of galaxies, producing intense radiation as they fed and, in the case of quasars, blasting out incredibly powerful jets of material in opposite directions, heating the surrounding galactic gas until it glowed in radio frequencies. Thorne describes the much less mature search for gravitational waves, phenomena predicted to result from supernovae and black hole collisions, but as yet unobserved in 1993 (and, indeed, not directly observed until 2015, a discovery that led to Thorne being awarded a share of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics). In the 1970s came Stephen Hawking's startling prediction of black hole evaporation, powered by quantum fluctuations near the event horizon. Toward the end of the text, Thorne deals with the much more speculative question of the nature of the core of a black hole; the so-called gravitational singularity predicted by Einstein's field equations. By introducing quantum behavior to curved spacetime, several physicists have suggested that black holes do not possess a true mathematical singularity, but rather a region of chaotic space, in which time does not exist. The behavior of this space and the material which approaches it are not well understood, with a complete marriage of relativity and quantum physics yet to be achieved. In the final chapter, Thorne delves into even more speculative matters relating to black hole physics, including the existence and nature of wormholes and time machines. The book features a foreword by Stephen Hawking and an introduction by Frederick Seitz. In addition to the main text, the book provides biographical summaries of the major scientists in the text, a chronology of key events in the history of black hole physics, a glossary of technical terms, twenty-three pages of notes, a bibliography, and alphabetical indices of subjects and people referred to in the text. Reception Of the book, The New York Times wrote, \\"the close and sometimes difficult reasoning it embodies is lightened by a deft, anecdotal approach, and by the author's whimsical drawings and diagrams.\\" Kirkus Reviews opined that \\"the reader has to wade through many, many pages of theory and diagrams‚Äîobvious to the expert but too difficult for the lay reader. Thorne in fact is strongest for the novice reader when dealing with the history of the physics community\\".

The mountain was named in honour of Joseph Charles Bishop, the first president of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club (BCMC), who died in 1913 after falling into a crevasse whilst climbing on Mount Baker. History The first ascent of Mount Bishop was made in 1909 by a party of climbers from the British Columbia Mountaineering Club led by Fred Mills. The mountain was approached by boat to the top of Indian Arm, opposite Crocker Island, where the group camped overnight. In the morning they broke into two groups, the others climbing Mount Elsay (then known as Mount Jarrett) and headed up Bishop Creek. Among the Bishop party was a Mr Cromie, former owner of the Vancouver News-Advertiser (which became the Vancouver Sun). Upon reaching the summits of the two mountains at about 9.30am, the two parties of climbers called to each other.http://bivouac.com/PhotoPg.asp?PhotoId=5260 Hiking Routes Although Mount Bishop is very close to Vancouver, it is seldom climbed. Hikers now approach this mountain from either the BCMC trail on the west shoulder of Mount Elsay, or the North Shore Rescue trail which runs up from the East side of the Seymour Dam.

It is one of the four deep cerebellar nuclei (the others being the nucleus dentatus, nucleus emboliformis and nucleus globosus), and is grey matter embedded in the white matter of the cerebellum. It refers specifically to the concentration of gray matter nearest to the middle line at the anterior end of the superior vermis, and immediately over the roof of the fourth ventricle (the peak of which is called the fastigium), from which it is separated by a thin layer of white matter. It is smaller than the nucleus dentatus, but somewhat larger than the nucleus emboliformis and nucleus globosus. Although it is one dense mass, it is made up of two sections: the rostral fastigial nucleus and the caudal fastigial nucleus. Structure The Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex project into the deep cerebellar nuclei and inhibit the excitatory output system via GABAergic synapses. The fastigial nucleus receives its input from Purkinje cells in the vermis. Most of its efferent connections travel via the inferior cerebellar peduncle to the vestibular nuclei, which are located at the junction of the pons and the medulla oblongata. The fastigial nucleus sends excitatory projections beyond the cerebellum. The likely neurotransmitters of fastigial nucleus axons are glutamate and aspartate. =Rostral fastigial nucleus= The rostral fastigial nucleus (rFN) is related to the vestibular system. It receives input from the vestibular nuclei and contributes to vestibular neuronal activity. The rFN interprets body motion and places it on spatial planes to estimate the movement of the body through space.Brooks & Cullen, [Multimodal integration in rostral fastigial nucleus provides an estimate of body movement], 2009 It deals with antigravity muscle groups and other synergies involved with standing and walking. =Caudal fastigial nucleus= The caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN) is related to saccadic eye movements. The Purkinje cell output from the oculomotor vermis relays through the cFN, where neurons directly related to saccadic eye movements are located.Kleine, Guan, & Buttner, [Saccade-related neurons in the primate fastigial nucleus: what do they encode?], 2003 References *Online Medical Dictionary entry External links * * https://web.archive.org/web/20150621011739/http://www.mona.uwi.edu/fpas/courses/physiology/neurophysiology/Cerebellum.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20080405062814/http://www.lib.mcg.edu/edu/eshuphysio/program/section8/8ch6/s8ch6_29.htm * NIF Search - Fastigial Nucleus via the Neuroscience Information Framework Category:Cerebellum ","title":"Fastigial nucleus"},{"id":"2486862","text":"The five elements philosophy in Japanese Buddhism, , is derived from tantric Buddhist beliefs. It is perhaps best known in the Western world for its use in Miyamoto Musashi's famous text Gorin-no-sho (The Book of Five Rings), in which he explains different aspects of swordsmanship by assigning each aspect to an element. The elements The five elements are Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Void. As such, these may describe an individual's response to direct confrontation, such as in martial arts (including associations with physical center of tension and movement, body vibrations, footwork, one's response to attack, and the attacker's emotional response): #Chi: stability/stubbornness; holding ground and using strength and presence (source: strength) #Sui: flexibility/emotionalism; defensive angling and footwork to overextend the attacker before counterattacking (source: power) #Ka: aggression/fear; using high energy attacks defensively (source: energy) #Fu: wisdom/love; evasive, elusive methods that redirect attacks away from their targets (source: resiliency) #Ku: creative/communicative; spontaneous and inventive fighting =Earth= upright=0.5 Âú∞ Chi (sometimes ji) or tsuchi, meaning \\"Earth\\", represents the hard, solid objects of Earth. The most basic example of chi is in a stone. Stones are highly resistant to movement or change, as is anything heavily influenced by chi. In people, the bones, muscles and tissues are represented by chi. Emotionally, chi is predominantly associated with stubbornness, collectiveness, stability, physicality, and gravity. It is a desire to have things remain as they are; a resistance to change. In the mind, it is confidence. When under the influence of this chi mode or \\"mood\\", we are aware of our own physicality and sureness of action. This is a separate concept from the energy-force, pronounced in Chinese as q√¨ (also written ch'i) and in Japanese as ki, and written alternatively as Ê∞ó, Ê∞£, or Ê∞î. =Water= upright=0.5 Ê∞¥ Sui or mizu, meaning \\"Water\\", represents the fluid, flowing, and the formless things in the world. Outside of the obvious example of rivers and the lake, plants are also categorized under sui, as they adapt to their environment, growing and changing according to the direction of the sun and the changing seasons. Blood and other bodily fluids are represented by sui, as are mental or emotional tendencies towards adaptation and change. Sui can be associated with emotion, defensiveness, adaptability, flexibility, suppleness, and magnetism. =Fire= upright=0.5 ÁÅ´ Ka or hi, meaning \\"Fire\\", represents the energetic, forceful, moving things in the world. Animals, capable of movement and full of forceful energy, are primary examples of ka objects. Bodily, ka represents our metabolism and body heat, and in the mental and emotional realms, it represents drive and passion. Ka can be associated with security, motivation, desire, intention, and an outgoing spirit. =Wind= upright=0.5 È¢® F≈´ or kaze, meaning \\"Wind\\", represents things that grow, expand, and enjoy freedom of movement. Aside from air, smoke and the like, f≈´ can in some ways be best represented by the human mind. As we grow physically, we learn and expand mentally as well, in terms of our knowledge, our experiences, and our personalities. F≈´ represents breathing, and the internal processes associated with respiration. Mentally and emotionally, it represents an \\"open- minded\\" attitude and carefree feeling. It can be associated with will, elusiveness, evasiveness, benevolence, compassion, and wisdom. =Void (Aether)= upright=0.5 Á©∫ K≈´ or sora, most often translated as \\"Void\\", but also meaning \\"sky\\" or \\"heaven\\", represents those things beyond our everyday experience, particularly those things composed of pure energy and beyond; the emptiness that the energy is made up of. Bodily, k≈´ represents spirit, thought, and creative energy. It represents our ability to think and to communicate, as well as our creativity. It can also be associated with power, creativity, spontaneity, and inventiveness. K≈´ is of particular importance as the highest of the elements. In martial arts, particularly in fictional tales where the fighting discipline is blended with magic or the occult, one often invokes the power of the Void to connect to the quintessential creative energy of the world. A warrior properly attuned to the Void can sense their surroundings and act without using the mind, and without using their \\"physical senses\\". Representations of the godai Kawase Hasui's \\"Evening Glow at Yanaka\\" (1921) The most common representations today of the five elements, outside of martial arts and fictional references, are found in Buddhist architecture. Japanese gorint≈çes (go-rin-to, the Japanese word of 'go' means 'five', 'rin' means 'ring shape', and 'to' means the 'tower'.) as seen in Zen gardens and Buddhist temples, represent as a Stupa. These have five divisions which represent the five elements, although the five segments can be hard to discern. The bottom-most piece, touching the ground, represents chi; the next section represents sui; ka is represented by the section encasing the lantern's light or flame, while f≈´ and k≈´ are represented by the last two sections, top-most and pointing towards the sky. It is composed from bottom to top of a cube, a sphere, a pyramid, a crescent and something resembling a lotus flower, shapes that also have the meaning described above. The stone lanterns, that is very similar to the gorinto, is a stone tower of modest size put on a center line for the approach mainly to the Buddhist temples and cemeteries, but the functional meaning of toro is different from the gorinto, to illuminate the approach to the temple as like lighthouses, for the strict Buddhist ceremony at night .

Between 2002 and 2004 the school was upgraded under the PRIME programme, enlarging and improving the school facilities. In 2002 and 2003 Damai came 49th in Singapore in its express stream results. In 2002 it was awarded the People Developer Standard (this was renewed in 2005 for another three years.) Its technical stream was awarded the 30th Singapore NUTMEG Prize. This was presented by the managing director, Chang Yeng Yong. The school has strong emphasis on National Education and was awarded the Outstanding Development Award NE from 2006-2010. Its NE framework includes student leadership development, student-centric processes, NE integrated curriculum & establishing strategic partnerships with the community. The school was successful in creating a Borderless Learning environment in 2010 using mobile devices, WiFi & Bluetooth technology. The school's inter-disciplinary Project Work is integrated with the use of ICT. In 2008, the school introduced the use of mobile learning, using Bluetooth- enabled handphones to engage its lower and upper secondary students.

It had since been relocated again on 4 December 1999 to its current premises at 20 Jalan Damai in order to accommodate the increasing number of staff and students. Due to a fall in enrollment, Bedok North Secondary will be closed on 1 January 2018, with operations merged with Damai Secondary.22 secondary schools to merge over next 2 years due to falling demand  Culture & Identity Uniform and discipline= Damai students wear an all-white uniform: white shirt (with maroon school tie), white trousers and maroon coloured skirt for girls, white shoes and socks. Boys in secondary 1 and secondary 2 must wear short trousers, graduating to long trousers in secondary 3. The disciplinary system is based on a demerit points system for minor offences. Students earn demerit points each time their shirt is not tucked in or they are not wearing their tie or for being late to class, eating in class, etc. If they reach 10 points they must serve a detention. At 20 points there is another detention, and the student's parents are informed. Students who reach 30 demerit points in one term are suspended for a number of days (girls) or spanked on the bottom with a big cane (boys) and their conduct is marked \\"Fair\\". Detentions are also given out for latecoming for a number of times. The detention lasts 2 to 4 hours and must be served the following day. Students who fail to turn up for the allotted detention receive suspension (girls) or spanking (boys). Boys who are caught smoking in school uniform are disciplined with two smacks of the cane and are also referred to the health authority to attend smoking cessation clinic. For other serious offences such as fighting or vandalism, the student, if male, must receive a \\"public caning\\" whereby he is brought in front of an assembly of the full student body either in the hall or on the parade square. Normally a public caning at Damai involves several boys punished in turn. The spanking ceremony is performed by the school's Discipline Master, with a minimum of two strokes across the buttocks for each offender. This serves as a deterrent and it is often only necessary to hold one or two public canings each term.Damai Discipline Procedures page (2008) . In 1997, then-principal James Ong told the Los Angeles Times that caning was administered at Damai for offences including fighting or disrespecting a teacher. \\"We do not seek permission from parents\\", he said. \\"We will cane first and inform you later. Parents must trust us to give the child a good education. We have the welfare of the children in mind.\\"\\"Clinton to US schools: Catch up with Singapore\\", The Straits Times, Singapore, 9 March 1997. = School Logo = Designed by Samuel Teo Gek Seng, the DMSS logo incorporates the initials DSS of Damai Secondary School, forming the seed of education which is of primary importance in the formative years of young people and which when carefully planted will grow into flames of faith, hope, and charity, the three components of the school motto. = House Affiliations = DMSS house of the year trophy From 1994-2015, to encourage a competitive spirit, Damai Secondary School has a house system comprising four houses. They are the Achievers (Red), Strivers (Blue), Victors (Green), and Winners (Yellow). At the start of every year, each new student starting in Secondary 1 is allocated by the PE department into one of these houses, based on his/her index number in class. There are regular house meetings for the selection of new house leaders, and allowing the house members to decide if they want to join in a particular sports events on sports day. Following the house meetings there are house-related activities such as sports or quizzes. There is a cumulative points system, strengthened by participation in sport or other events. At the end of the year, the house that has accumulated the most points is declared \\"house of the year\\", winning the trophy of the house of the year.  Campus  Damai has a main building including a general-purpose hall, about 40 to 50 classrooms (including the Geography and History Rooms), an AV Theatre, Media Resource Library, 4 Computer Labs, 2 Physics Labs, 2 Biology Labs, 2 Chemistry Labs, Staff Common Rooms, a Canteen, a bookshop, general office, conference room, two FCE (home economics) kitchens, Retail Operations room, Design and Technology staff room, D&T; Innovation Lab, a T&L; lab, and a cafeteria. There is a \\"Harmony Room\\" with exhibits on the different races in Singapore and their unique cultures, and the school's history. Damai has developed a \\"wireless mobile learning environment\\" through the use of Bluetooth or WiFi technology. This allows students to use their smartphones (with the teachers' permission) in class to send answers to questions that their teachers sent using their own mobile phones or notebooks. This also allows a Damaian student to complete assignments as many projects are to be done online, on Microsoft or PowerPoint.  Academic Information  Being an integrated secondary school, Damai Secondary School offers three academic streams, namely the four-year Express course, as well as the Normal Course, comprising Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) academic tracks. = O Level Express Course = The Express Course is a nationwide four-year programme that leads up to the Singapore- Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examination. = Normal Course = The Normal Course is a nationwide 4-year programme leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Normal Level examination, which runs either the Normal (Academic) curriculum or Normal (Technical) curriculum.  Normal (Academic) Course  In the Normal (Academic) course, students offer 5-8 subjects in the Singapore- Cambridge GCE Normal Level examination. Compulsory subjects include: * English Language * Mother Tongue Language * Mathematics * Combined Humanities A 5th year leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examination is available to students in Normal (Academic) course who perform well in their Singapore-Cambridge GCE Normal Level examination. Students can move from one course to another based on their performance and the assessment of the school principal and teachers.  Normal (Technical) Course  The Normal (Technical) course prepares students for a technical-vocational education at the Institute of Technical Education. Students will offer 5-7 subjects in the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Normal Level examination. The curriculum is tailored towards strengthening students‚Äô proficiency in English and Mathematics. Students take English Language, Mathematics, Basic Mother Tongue and Computer Applications as compulsory subjects. = Twinning and Exchange projects = In view of rising globalisation, Damai has realised the need for interaction with other schools all over the world, for more resources and better strategies. To this end, in June 2006 Damai entered a bilateral \\"sister schools\\" link with Dongpo Experimental Middle School (DEMS) (in Emeishan, Sichuan, China) in March‚ÄìJune 2006. In the process, two department heads from Damai were sent to China to visit the school, and to sign the agreement. Twinning immersion projects have been held for some DEMS students visiting Singapore. Their activities in Singapore included curriculum immersion lessons, CCA hands-on, and NELJ. Meanwhile, administrative staff accompanying the students learned about the Singapore's education system, and the mode of operation in a typical Singaporean secondary school. In 2009 Damai has established an Internationalization Committee to further develop cross-cultural learning and relation-building with people of other countries. Co-curricular activities (CCAs) Damai Softball Team As an integral part of Singapore's educational system, Damai has planned for suitable CCA programmes to teach pupils skills, inculcate in them the correct values and desirable social attitudes, and provide for healthy recreation. Performing groups include , Guzheng , Modern dance , School choir (Damaivoice) and Symphonic band (DamaiWindz) . Sports and Games includes canoeing , netball , softball and rugby . Uniformed Groups includes The Boy's Brigade , Girl Guides , NCC , NPCC , Scouts and SJAB . Clubs and Societies includes The Art Club , Library and The Media Club . = Student Parliament = Members of the Student Parliament are known as student councillors, or simply \\"councillors\\". Entry is based on a teacher's recommendation or nomination when the student is in Secondary 1. Councillors obtain LEAPS CCA points under the \\"Leadership\\" category, and are given certain rights over other ordinary students' discipline. Councillors must wear a special school tie and a name badge with the word \\"Student Councillor\\" on it. With effect from 2008, Student Councillors, Peer Leaders and National Education Ambassadors merged to form the Damai Student Leadership body, known as Student Leaders. The Student Leaders represent the student population of Damai Secondary School and have organized many school events. The Student Leaders organize events like the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp and Teachers‚Äô Day celebrations yearly. The Student Leaders are also actively involved in other events like the Sports Day, Meet-the-Parents sessions and Prom Ball. The Student Leaders also assist in the running of the school, which includes morning and weekly assembly duties. Student Leaders actively spread National Education messages to the student population, extend community and national outreach and promote the school image and pride.

He appeared on eight full-length albums, three EPs and a live album with the Bosstones, as well as touring continuously throughout the world, until the band's announcement of a hiatus in December 2003. The band's 1997 release, Let's Face It, would prove to be the band's biggest break, mostly due to the first single \\"The Impression That I Get,\\" which charted at number one on the Billboard charts. In 2003, Barrett began working on an untitled solo album. The album was said to be a radical departure from the ska-core sound made popular by the Bosstones. Barrett was quoted as saying that the album will be \\"more sombre, darker\\". Fellow Bosstone, Lawerence Katz, was said to be assisting Barrett with the recording of the album. However, there has been no further mention of the album, and it's uncertain whether the album will be released.

Chinlone (, ), also known as caneball, is the traditional, national sport of Myanmar (Burma). It is non-competitive, with typically six people playing together as one team. The ball used is normally made from handwoven rattan, which sounds like a basket when hit. Similar to the game of hacky-sack, chinlone is played by individuals passing the ball among each other within a circle without using their hands. However, in chinlone, the players are walking while passing the ball, with one player in the center of the circle. The point of the game is to keep the ball from hitting the ground while passing it back and forth as creatively as possible. The sport of chinlone is played by men, women and children, often together, interchangeably. Although very fast, chinlone is meant to be entertaining and fluid, as if it were more of a performance or dance.Dir. Hamilton, Greg (2006). Mystic Ball. Film, Black Rice Productions. History One of the first photographs of men playing chinlone, taken around 1899 Chinlone has played a prominent role in Myanmar for about 1,500 years. Its style is performance-based because it was first created as a demonstrative means of activity for entertaining Burmese royalty. Chinlone is heavily influenced by traditional Burmese martial arts and dance, another reason as to why so much importance is placed upon technique. As it is such an old game, many variations have been made to it, including hundreds of moves for maneuvering the ball. In addition to the original form of chinlone, there is a single performance style called tapandaing. While chinlone had been widely considered by Europeans to be more of a game than an actual sport, international interest in chinlone grew rapidly. By 1911, chinlone teams were performing in parts of Europe and Asia. As spectators of chinlone, Europeans derisively deemed it to be merely an entertaining game of indigenous people, too passive and not violent or masculine enough to be considered a sport. After Myanmar's independence from British colonial rule in 1948, many British influences and cultural practices lingered, including those British sports such as cricket and polo. British colonialism dominant culture still weighed heavily upon Burmese life. From the 1960s onward, the government strongly promoted traditional and historical preservation in an effort to renew native cultural pride. Myanmar needed to focus on traditions that were unique to Burmese culture, free from any colonial influence. Chinlone fit this role perfectly, playing a key part in establishing Burmese nationalism. Myanmar began implementing physical education in schools, teaching children from a young age about traditional activities and sports like chinlone as a way to educate and increase pride in their own culture. This was a small yet effective way in reestablishing unique Burmese life after many generations of colonial rule. With this newfound nationalism, chinlone was finally considered a real and cooperative sport. The head of the Burma Athletic Association, U Ah Yein, was ordered by the Burmese government to write a rulebook for chinlone in 1953. These rules forced chinlone to become more competitive, and the first official chinlone competition was held in Yangon that same year. In addition to providing chinlone with an official set of rules, U Ah Yein's chinlone rulebook claimed chinlone to be unique to Myanmar only, as the birthplace of the game. While chinlone does distinctively go back far into Burmese tradition, there are many similar sports closely related to it across many other Southeast Asian countries, such as da cau (Vietnam), kator (Laos), sepak raga (Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia), sipa (Philippines) and takraw (Thailand).Watercolor painting of a chinlone game from the 19th century. = In the 2013 Southeast Asian Games = The 2013 Southeast Asian Games were hosted in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw, the first Southeast Asian Games in Myanmar since 1969. Chinlone was included as a separate sport within the competition, and was also featured in the closing ceremony. The inclusion of chinlone was controversial, as other countries were not adequately prepared to compete in a uniquely Burmese sport.

It is owned and operated by the Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc., a subsidiary of the Church of Scientology International. The hotel has 11 stories and features 220 rooms, three restaurants, a swimming pool and a ballroom. The building is connected by a skywalk to the Flag Building. History The hotel opened in 1926 as the \\"New Fort Harrison Hotel\\", replacing the former Fort Harrison Hotel. It was built by developer Ed Haley and was used as a community center for many years. The hotel was operated by Ransom E. Olds, inventor of the Oldsmobile, from 1926 until his death in 1950. The name comes from a Seminole War-era U.S. Army fort, built in the 1830s south of today's downtown Clearwater. The fort was named for William Henry Harrison and was the western counterpart of Fort Brooke in what became Tampa. (See also the history of Clearwater.) In 1953, the hotel was bought by the Jack Tar Hotels and became known as the \\"New Fort Harrison Hotel, a Jack Tar Hotel\\". The company added a cabana area to the building. By the 1970s, the hotel began to fall into disrepair. In 1975, the Church of Scientology purchased the building under the names \\"Southern Land Development and Leasing Corp\\" and \\"United Churches of Florida Inc\\". In 1976, the Church of Scientology's connection and the named purchasers was reported by the St. Petersburg Times, as was the Church's plan for a $2.8 million restoration and upgrade of the hotel. In 2007, the Church announced that the hotel would undergo another $20 million restoration project, but not when the project would begin. Use in Scientology The Fort Harrison Hotel is used by the Church of Scientology as an area in which to feed, train and house visiting practitioners. It provides both accommodation and \\"course & auditing\\" rooms, for Scientologists studying at high levels of Scientology. The Fort Harrison is joined by a walkway bridge over South Fort Harrison Avenue to the Flag Building on the other side of the street. The hotel was used for the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF), a program used to punish members of the Church of Scientology Sea Organization for \\"serious deviations.\\" Members of the church in this institution are subject to prison-like conditions, forced labor and other human rights violations.\\"Scientology ‚Äî Is This a Religion?\\" Scientology‚ÄîIs This a Religion?

Notable incidents In December 1926, daredevil Henry Roland scaled the building blindfolded. The Fort Harrison Hotel has been the site of at least three suspicious deaths since 1975, most notably the death of Lisa McPherson, who died on December 5, 1995, after spending 17 days in room 174 of the building. The officially reported cause of death was a blood clot caused by dehydration and bedrest. The Church later challenged the findings of the autopsy in court. In 1997, a church spokesman acknowledged that McPherson died at the Fort Harrison, rather than on the way to the hospital. The church later retracted its spokesman's statement. In February 1980, prior to McPherson's death, a Scientologist named Josephus A. Havenith was found dead at the Fort Harrison Hotel. He was discovered in a bathtub filled with water hot enough to have burned his skin off. The officially reported cause of death was drowning, although the coroner noted that, when he was found, Havenith's head was not submerged. In August 1988, Scientologist Heribert Pfaff died of a seizure in the Fort Harrison Hotel. He had recently stopped taking his seizure medication in favor of a vitamin program. In 1997, Clearwater police received over 160 emergency calls from the Fort Harrison Hotel, but they were denied entry into the hotel by Scientology security. Trivia In 1965, the Rolling Stones wrote their hit song \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" at the hotel. The hotel was once the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies.

The administrative part of Ro≈æany has a border crossing to Sohland an der Spree. HistoryEarly history= During the middle of the 14th century, on the site of the town, a Slavic settlement named Slanknov was established by the noble family of Berka z Dub√©. The family's coat of arms is, to this day, the inescutcheon in the town's coat of arms. Schluckenau was struck, in 1710 and 1830, by two large town fires. In 1813, the town was plundered by a 200,000 man army during the Napoleonic wars. Until 1918, Schlukenau (Schluckenau since the end of the 19th century) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district of the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 =Nazi era= In 1930, Schluckenau was home to 5578 inhabitants who were largely ethnic German. Prior to the Second World War, Schluckenau was a center in Czechoslovakia for the pro-Nazist Sudeten German Party (SdP) led by Konrad Henlein. This was one reason why, in March 1939,Not in October 1938, as other parts of the Sudetenland?? Adolf Hitler chose the town as the first stop of the Wehrmacht during the German annexation of Sudetenland. The Wehrmacht continued on to occupy Prague and establish the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Following the invasion by the Wehrmacht some Czechs were driven out of Schluckenau into the interior of Bohemia. From 1938 until 1945 Schluckenau was the seat for the district administrator of the County of Schluckenau in the Nazist German Sudetenland, the district of Aussig (). =Modern history= After the war, in 1945, the town returned to Czechoslovakia and the German inhabitants were expelled under the terms of Bene≈° decrees.

The aircraft is capable of landing on short and unpaved runways and operating under extreme conditions from to . By 2016, 1,200 L-410s had been built, and over 350 are in service in more than 50 countries. Development Walter M601 engine installation Commuter cabin Development of the L-410 was started in the 1960s by the Czechoslovak aircraft manufacturer Let Kunovice. The Soviet airline Aeroflot was looking for a turboprop-powered replacement for the Antonov An-2 aircraft, initiating the design development by Let. After preliminary studies of an aircraft called the L-400, a new version was introduced called the L-410 Turbolet. The first prototype, designated XL-410, flew on April 16, 1969. Because of delays in the development of a suitable Czech engine (Walter M601), the prototype and first production version were powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-27 engines. After M601 development was completed, the PT6 engine was replaced by M601 engines coupled with Avia V508 three-blade propellers and the next variant was introduced, the L-410M. A further version for Aeroflot was the L-410 UVP. This has improved performance in take-off and landing due to increased wing and tail area - STOL. However, due to an increased empty weight and a shift in the center of gravity, the aircraft had a decreased seating capacity: 15 passengers. The L-410 UVP-E (the most common variant of the L-410) has increased maximum take-off weight to 6400 kg, M601E engines with increased power, new five-blade propellers designated V 510 and the provision for wing tip tanks to increase fuel quantity. First flight was made in 1984, and production started in 1986. The L-410 UVP-E9 and UVP-E20 are versions which vary from each other only by minor changes arising from various certification regulations. The last L-410 family member is the L-420 which uses the new Walter engine variant, the M601F. Currently produced L-410 UVP-E20s are powered by next derivative of M601 engine designated as GE H80-200 and new Avia Propeller AV-725 five blade propellers. The L-420 was first approved by the US FAA on March 11, 1998, then the L-410 UVP-E20 on June 30, 2015. The L-410 UVP-E20 was EASA certified on 4 February 2005 on the other variants on 28 March 2007. On 3 September 2013 the Russian company UGMK (Iskander Machmudov) became the wholesale owner of LET Kunovice Aircraft Industries. They announced that they would produce the L-410 also in Russia within the year. On 7 July 2015 UGMK represented first L 410 NG aircraft manufactured in Russia.  Design  Landing on snow The L-410 UVP-E is an unpressurized all-metal high-wing commuter aircraft, with Avia V 510 five- blade propellers. It is equipped with a retractable undercarriage. The aircraft uses two hydraulic circuits: main and emergency. The main electrical system operates with 28V DC. The de-icing system is leading edge pneumatic deicers and electrical heating of propellers, cockpit windshields and pitot- static system heads. Maximum take-off weight of the L-410 UVP-E is 6400 kg with the possibility of an increase to 6600 kg for the E9 and E20 variants, seating capacity 17 to 19. Cruise speed is 170 KIAS, maximum range about . The airplane is certified for IFR operation, CAT I ILS approach, and flights in icing conditions. The L 410 UVP-E20 is certified on the basis of FAR 23 either Amendment 34 or Amendment 41. It is certified by the EU, the Russian Federation, the US, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Cuba, India, Nepal, Philippines, Korea, Indonesia, Republic of South Africa, Algeria, Australia, Taiwan, Turkey, and many other countries accepting some of the previous certificates. The aircraft has also been approved for operation in a number of other countries, such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Tunisia, Colombia, Venezuela, South Korea and others.

With at least 20 fatal crashes from 2003 to 2013, it is one of the most accident- prone aircraft. However, the operator's safety rating and operations procedures are more important than the aircraft design, and the L-410 operate where most aircraft cannot, in rugged mountains and jungles, often onto grass or gravel runways; the latest L-410 UVP-E20 and L-420 produced since 1990 have an excellent safety record.

The airport provides the Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area and surrounding towns with access to international and domestic flights. The airport was built over the mountains surrounding the Bucaramanga plateau. A mountain road connects the city with the airport, which is located at about 1,200 m above sea level (The city of Bucaramanga is located at 950 m above sea level). The airport bears the name of the nearby area, \\"Palonegro\\". This was the place of a famous battle of the Thousand Days War, which happened in the early 20th century. The airport receives flights from major cities in Colombia as well as international flights from Panama City. The main terminal is 25 minutes from the city in the fast lane of the highway west to Giron. It is currently positioned as the eighth largest airport in Colombia in terms of passenger movement. The Bucaramanga VOR-DME (Ident: BGA) is located on the field.Bucaramanga VOR  History  Palonegro International Airport, located in the Municipality of Lebrija, marked a new stage of progress for the Department of Santander and its capital, the city of Bucaramanga. The work was directed by the Administrative Department of Civil Aviation, who also were responsible for the construction of new airports and Pitalito Monteria and remodelling in Leticia and Eldorado in this period. The modern facility that was opened by the President Misael Pastrana in August 1974 just before leaving office, they replaced the old airport \\"Gomez Ni√±o\\". The inaugural flight took place on a Boeing 727 Avianca Company, commanded by Captain Alvaro Barrera G√≥mez. G√≥mez Ni√±o Airport, located within the urban area of Bucaramanga was for 25 years who attended the air traffic in the city with significant limitations, given their geographical location and its adverse conditions for security and air navigation. In fact, there were several fatal air accidents brought mourning to the city and country. The old airport, located in the current Ciudadela Real de Minas, was built by the company Scadta in late 1938, when operations began in Junkers F-13 aircraft in its wheels. Child G√≥mez Airport was purchased by Empresa Colombiana de Aerodrome in 1954 and was one of the few airports in Colombia that operated two runways simultaneously, built in a configuration of X, which allowed their use depending on the prevailing winds. Aerotaxi Avianca and had a great hub and other airlines such as Taxader, had its headquarters at the airport. The site of the Palonegro Airport was the historic setting of political strife and the battle of the same name, which took place on 25 May 1900, during the War of the Thousand Days. The land where existing facilities are located and the runway was formed by a series of no less than seven hills of considerable height and six canyons with depths exceeding 60 metres. That is why it was necessary to move at least 14 million cubic metres of earth in successful operation and a great engineering work that began in 1969. The location of the airport has an elevation of 1190 m relative to sea level and an average temperature of 21 degrees Celsius, and distant 18 kilometers from Bucaramanga on the main road that passes through the historic town of Giron. The airport facilities were designed to address the movement of aircraft and the growth of passenger and cargo traffic projected until 1990 and thereafter. A taxiway parallel to the runway was built later, along with the facilities, apron, and hangars to serve general aviation.  Renovation  The airport was renovated from 2014 to 2018. The newly renovated airport was inaugurated by president Juan Manuel Santos in February 2018. The cost of the renovation was approximately $70 million colombian pesos. The renovation also increased the capacity from 1.8 to 2.5 million people per year, and consisted of the expansion of the departures hall, check-in areas, baggage claim areas, airline offices, and new jet bridges. The terminal was doubled in square footage, going from 80,000 to nearly 200,000 square feet.  Structure and capacity  The planning of the passenger terminal building is 7000 square meters of construction, took into account the uneven terrain where this arises. This allows passengers arriving to Palonegro able to be mobilized by first level smoothly. In this first level is the baggage room, which communicates with the parking lot. In turn, passengers leave the city with easy access to the terminal by a wide road that communicates with the dispatch hall airlines. From there down wide stairs to the waiting room have a boarding capacity for 400 people. The terminal building also has a restaurant, a popular caf√©, stores, offices of Civil Aviation and Meteorology and tourism services, Telecom, the National Police, Customs, airport security and aviation fire station. The Control Tower has a height of equivalent to 10 floors, where one can see widely the length of the runway in its entirety and platforms for parking of passenger and cargo aircraft. The Colombian company Terpel was responsible for building and operating storage tanks and supply facilities. A road links the terminal with the main road from Bucaramanga to Barrancabermeja. The total cost of Palonegro International Airport was $230 million pesos in 1974. For the year 2007 was ranked among the 10 top airports in Colombia, and for this reason the Civil Aviation decided to invest in expanding and building a new boarding area national and international. 70-80 daily flights are now carried out by scheduled airlines in five domestic destinations: ADA, Avianca, Copa Airlines Colombia, EasyFly, Aires and Satena. The airport has international flights to Fort Lauderdale International Airport through Spirit Airlines and Tocumen International Airport through Copa Airlines. Palonegro currently ranks eighth in passenger traffic in the country. The National Government through its Ministry of Transport and continuing with the policy of granting airports, airport included in the so- called Group Palonegro Northeast. The airport group comprises the airports in C√∫cuta, Barrancabermeja, Valledupar, Santa Marta and Riohacha.  Airlines and destinations  The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport: Accidents and incidents *On 14 December 1977, Vickers Viscount HK-1267 of TAC Colombia was damaged beyond repair while landing.

Pink Five), a fast-talking Valley Girl-type dropped into an X-wing cockpit during the Battle of Yavin, and presents familiar events and story points from Episode IV from a very different point of view.  Reception  The film has proven popular with Star Wars fans, winning rave reviews and the George Lucas Selects Award in the AtomFilms- and Lucasfilm-sponsored 2003 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, and even played at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. In August 2010, Time magazine listed it as one of the Top 10 Star Wars fanfilms.  Sequels and other appearances  The success of the first short film inspired sequels: Pink Five Strikes Back (2004), Return of Pink Five, Vol. 1 (2006) and Return of Pink Five, Vol. 2 (2007). With each successive installment, the chapters grew in length and in sophisticated visuals. Unfortunately, the increased expense meant that funding to complete the final chapter (and resolve the cliffhanger at the end of Vol.2) was unavailable for nearly a decade. Finally, after a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, Return of Pink Five, Vol. 3 was finished, and the complete 59-minute Pink Five Saga was screened at conventions around the country in 2013. Later, the saga was released online in 2016. Originally available on Vimeo, the saga has been available on Amazon Video since July 2016. Stacey appears in Timothy Zahn's 2007 Star Wars novel Allegiance, making her one of the few fan-created Star Wars characters ever to become part of the Star Wars expanded universe. Stacey also has a brief cameo in the fan film Sith Apprentice, directed by John E. Hudgens. Additionally, Stacey has now been immortalized on a Topps 30th Anniversary Trading Card. Card #117 (\\"Fan Films\\") details the exploits of the Valley Girl X-wing Pilot and her faithful droid, R5-DD. An original Pink 5 poster also appears in The Star Wars Vault by Steve Sansweet.

It was directed by David Zucker, written by Jim Abrahams, Craig Mazin, and Pat Proft, and produced by Robert K. Weiss and Craig Mazin. The film marks the final franchise appearances of the main stars, Anna Faris and Regina Hall (who portray Cindy and Brenda, respectively), and concludes the original story arc. This was initially intended to be the final film in the Scary Movie franchise, until Scary Movie 5 was released by The Weinstein Company on April 12, 2013, in a different storyline, with Simon Rex, Charlie Sheen, and Molly Shannon in different roles. Plot Shaquille O'Neal and Dr. Phil wake up to find themselves chained to pipes in a bathroom. Their host, Billy the Puppet, reveals that the room is slowly filling with nerve gas with the only way out being to make a basket and get the saws, which have to be used on their feet. Unfortunately, Dr. Phil saws the wrong foot and faints, leaving the two to die. Meanwhile, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) visits her brother-in-law, Tom Logan (Charlie Sheen) in New York City. Her husband George (Simon Rex) has died, and her nephew Cody has enrolled in military academy, leaving her broke and lonely. Tom's attempted suicide results in his ingesting viagra, which greatly swells his penis and causes his death when he falls off the railing. Afterwards, Cindy takes a job to care for Mrs. Norris (Cloris Leachman), who lives in a haunted house. Next door is Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko), who runs into George's friends Mahalik (Anthony Anderson) and CJ (Kevin Hart), learning about their homosexual one-night stand. He is greeted at home by the arrival of his estranged children, Robbie (Beau Mirchoff) and Rachel (Conchita Campbell). Over the following day, Cindy bonds with Tom, confiding to him about George's death in a fateful boxing match. The two realize their newfound love, but are interrupted by a gigantic triPod which disables electricity and starts vaporizing the town residents. Cindy converses in mock Japanese with the haunted house's ghost, Toshio (Garrett Masuda), learning that the answer of the invasion is his father's heart. While Tom leaves the city with his children, Cindy reunites with her friend, Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), miraculously alive after her death (having been pieces back together by Mahalik). Following Toshio's directions, the two head to the countryside and end up in a mysterious, isolated community. They are captured and put to trial headed by Henry Hale (Bill Pullman). The result allows them to live but never leave the village. Meanwhile, an emergency United Nations meeting, headed by the eccentric U.S. President Baxter Harris (Leslie Nielsen), who is reluctant to stop reading \\"My Pet Duck\\", goes awry when a weapon scavenged from the aliens renders everyone stark-naked. Tom and his children drive and find themselves in the middle of a war between the U.S. military and the aliens. Excited with the conflict, Robbie runs away, while Tom and Rachel are taken by the triPod. Back at the village, Henry is killed by the village loon, Ezekiel (Chris Elliott), revealing to Cindy that he fathered Toshio, who was killed during Cindy's boxing match. Cindy and Brenda are soon taken by the triPod and sent to the bathroom seen in the prologue, and they get stuck into the Venus flytrap. Cindy manages to get through Billy's challenge, but is threatened with the safety of Tom and his children, who are put to traps. Looking at a toilet with the \\"heart\\" nearby, Cindy realizes that Billy, through Henry's wife, is the true father of Toshio. Seeing how far Tom would go to save his children, Billy apologizes for the invasion and releases them. Robbie and Rachel are successfully returned to their mother (Molly Shannon), who is revealed to have married a much older man. Brenda also becomes romantically involved with Billy's brother, Zoltar. An epilogue set nine months afterward, narrated by James Earl Jones who is subsequently hit by a bus, reveals Brenda's giving birth to her child with Zoltar, Mahalik and CJ resuming their relationship, and President Harris being contented with his duck. Meanwhile, Tom appears in The Oprah Winfrey Show and wildly professes his love for Cindy by jumping around, throwing Cindy, and crushing Oprah's wrists and hitting her with a chair.

Two vessels, the left aorta and the pulmonary artery, exit the right ventricle. Blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, as in mammals and birds.

When the heart is relaxed, some oxygenated blood from the left ventricle, sitting in the right aorta, can flow into the left aorta across the foramen of Panizza.

She achieved fame for bringing the remains of Napoleon from Saint Helena back to France, in what became known as the Retour des cendres.  Career  Construction and early career = Although construction was started in 1828, Belle-Poule was launched only in 1834. She was one of the first ships to be built in a covered shipyard, which allowed the builders to delay construction while the political and financial circumstances were not favourable. Her design was inspired by .La victoire de la fr√©gate BELLE POULE She was commissioned in July 1835, and displayed very good sailing properties. On 1 August 1839, under command of the Prince of Joinville, third son of King Louis-Philippe, she left Cherbourg to join the Eastern fleet of Admiral Lalande. In October, she ran aground on the Taches Blanches, in the Dardanelles and was damaged. She was refloated and taken into Constantinople, Ottoman Empire for temporary repairs before sailing to Toulon for permanent repairs. = Retour des cendres = On 27 July 1840, she set sail with special equipment for Saint Helena to bring back the remains of Napoleon. She had been painted black for the occasion. On 30 September, she arrived back in Cherbourg, where, on 8 December, the Emperor's remains were transferred to the steamship Normandie. Normandie transported the remains to Le Havre and up the Seine to Rouen, for further transport to Paris. The transfer of the remains from Belle-Poule to Normandie in the road of Cherbourg was executed in much ceremony, and became a subject of choice for marine and romantic painters. = Canada and Morocco = In 1841, Belle-Poule cruised along the Canadian coast, landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia and visited New York City, where the Prince of Joinville visited the President of the United States. Belle-Poule was back in Toulon on 14 July 1842. In 1844, Joinville, then vice-admiral, was sent to Morocco to support the action of General Thomas Robert Bugeaud in Algeria, with , Jemmapes, Triton, and the frigate Belle-Poule. Tanger came under attack on 6 August, and Mogador was taken on 15 August. Afterwards, Belle-Poule cruised the Indian Ocean, where a cyclone left her with serious damage. She was repaired in Sainte-Marie de Madagascar, and returned to Brest. = Crimean War and late career = She took part in the Crimean War, mostly as a transport; she stayed in the East until August 1856, and sailed back to Toulon on 1 September. In 1859, she was used to transport ammunition, and was decommissioned on 19 March 1861. She was still used to store gunpowder until 1888.

Plot The story opens with Mustafa of Mudge, a turbaned desert monarch with blue whiskers, who collects lions. Mustafa demands one more lion ‚Äî he already has nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and a half lions, but there are no more lions in Mudge, and Mudgers are forbidden by Ozma, on penalty of death, to travel beyond the desert borders of Mudge. However, when Notta Bit More, a clown from the circus in Stumptown (somewhere in the humdrum backblocks of the United States of America), and a serious-minded orphan boy called Bobbie Downs (but renamed as Bob Up, by the cheerful Notta) drop into Mudge together, this seems to Mustafa to be his chance to send a non-Mudge person out to bring the famous Cowardly Lion to be the ten thousandth lion in Mudge. Using a magic ring, he enchants Notta and Bob and compels them to set out on a quest to capture the Cowardly Lion. Meanwhile, in the Emerald City, the Cowardly LionJack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 46. believes that he has depleted the reserve of courage imbued in him by the Wizard (as told in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). The mischievous Patchwork Girl, Scraps (who was first introduced in an earlier Baum-written title), misdirects the Lion into thinking that he can replenish his courage by eating a courageous man. Since the Lion dislikes the notion of harming anyone, he resolves to do the deed as quickly as possible, and so embarks on his quest to find, and eat, the bravest man in Oz. Unbeknownst to the Cowardly Lion, he is being hunted by Notta Bit More and Bob Up.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 22, 146. Accidentally, the three meet each other. Concealing their objective from the lion, Notta and Bob resolve to trick him into going to Mudge.

The feathery, bird-headed people of Un are all thoroughly ‚Äúunish‚Äú, or negative: unfriendly, unkind, ungrateful, and so on. The travellers meet a remarkable bird called Nickadoodle who tells them that if they remain on the isle of Un, they will grow feathers and become bird-like creatures themselves. Together, they escape the Island of Un in a flyaboutabus, which is a flying machine fitted with whirling feathered wheels. The Cowardly Lion, Notta, and Bob become fast friends, and reveal their secret plans to each other. The Cowardly Lion rejects his former plan to eat a brave man, and the travelers separate, the lion making his way to Mudge to appease Mustafa and prevent him from using his magic ring against Notta and Bob. Notta and Bob set out for the Emerald City to appeal to Ozma for help. The Cowardly Lion encounters Crunch, a stone giant, who joins him. Together they reach Mudge, where the giant transforms the Cowardly Lion into a stone statue to keep him company. However, Notta, Bob, Ozma, and the Wizard of Oz arrive and reverse the giant's transformation. Ozma takes away Mustafa's magic ring and order is restored.

In 1654 the community had 36 farm houses and 60 craftsman houses, mainly linen weavers. John Barnes, an English expert on textile industry, was hired in 1731 to found a spinning factory in the town.

The term was coined in 1939 in a talk by folklorist Benjamin A. Botkin who, along with Alan Lomax, became the foremost proponent of this approach over the next thirty years. Applied folklore is similar in its rationale and approach to applied anthropology and other applied social sciences, and like these other applied approaches often distinguishes itself from \\"pure\\" research, that which has no explicit problem-solving aims. Botkin's development of the approach emerged from his work on the collecting by the Federal Writers' Project of oral narratives of former slaves, when he worked for the Library of Congress. He saw the dissemination of these materials as having the potential to improve race relations in the United States and to combat prejudice. The abolition movement had similarly used the oral narratives of escaped slaves, such as those collected by William Still in his Underground Railroad Records, to draw support for their cause. Botkin's landmark work, Lay My Burden Down (1945) was the first American book to treat oral testimonies as historical evidence, and it was another thirty years before this became accepted practice. Botkin also worked with Quaker activist Rachel Davis DuBois to develop public programs to improve race and ethnic relations by incorporating cultural practices and materials into neighborhood events, such as festivals and block parties. Independent of this, Myles Horton, Zilphia Horton, Guy Carawan, Candie Carawan, and others at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee incorporated folk song and folk dance into the training of civil rights activists, such as Rosa Parks and John Lewis. In the 1960s, other American folklorists began to apply knowledge gained from folkloric sources to address social issues, most notably drawing on folk medicine in the teaching and practice of holistic and cross-cultural approaches to medicine and public health. Folklorists also began to work as consultants in city planning, gerontology, economic development, multicultural education, conservation, and other fields.

It was chartered in 1983 to operate a short section of ex-New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in northwestern Connecticut, and has since expanded north and south, as well as west into New York State. The Housatonic Railroad was also a company chartered in 1836 and leased by the New Haven in 1892. It followed much the same route as the current company, but did not run west into New York. HistoryRegional railroad: 1836-1898= Railroad tunnel which still exists, unused, in Newtown, Connecticut, as pictured in a postcard sent in 1905 The Housatonic Railroad, originally (mis)spelled as 'Ousatonic Railroad', was chartered in May 1836 to build a line from Bridgeport, Connecticut, north to the Massachusetts state line, along the Housatonic River valley. On February 19, 1840, regular service began from Bridgeport to New Milford, and on December 1, 1842, it opened to the state line. On the other side of the line, the Berkshire Railroad was incorporated April 13, 1837, to continue the line north to West Stockbridge, where it would connect to the West Stockbridge Railroad (see below) and the never-built Lee and Hudson Railroad. Construction began in February 1841, and it was completed on December 1, 1842, the same day the line in Connecticut opened. The Housatonic Railroad leased the Berkshire Railroad on January 1, 1843. The West Stockbridge Railroad was chartered in 1831 and incorporated April 5, 1836 to run from West Stockbridge west to State Line, where it would continue to the Hudson River in New York State as the Hudson and Berkshire Railroad. The line opened on August 10, 1838. On February 6, 1844, the Berkshire Railroad (then leased to the Housatonic) leased the West Stockbridge and Hudson and Berkshire Railroads. On November 21, 1854, the Western Railroad bought the Hudson and Berkshire, which became a branch from the Western's line (later the Boston and Albany Railroad) from Chatham to Hudson, and was abandoned east of Hudson. The West Stockbridge Railroad stayed part of the Housatonic system. The final section of main line was incorporated March 20, 1847, as the Stockbridge and Pittsfield Railroad. This line split from the original main line at Van Deusenville in Great Barrington and ran east and north to Pittsfield. The full line opened on January 1, 1850, under operation of the Housatonic, and was formally leased January 25. For a time the Housatonic operated the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad, running north from the Western Railroad east of Pittsfield to North Adams, but it was returned to the Boston and Albany Railroad, the successor to the Western, in the early 1870s. The Danbury and Norwalk Railroad opened in 1852 from Danbury south to Norwalk. The New York, Housatonic and Northern Railroad was chartered in 1863 to run from White Plains, New York, northeast via Danbury to Brookfield, Connecticut, on the Housatonic. It was only built north of Danbury, and on May 1, 1874, the Housatonic leased and opened it. On May 6, 1881, the Housatonic outright bought it, and on July 27, 1887, the Housatonic leased the Danbury and Norwalk, by then including branches to Ridgefield and Hawleyville (the latter on the Housatonic's main line) and a southern extension to Wilson Point. Penn Central Railroad Form 110 effective February 1, 1971, showing the final schedule for train service on the former Housatonic Railroad between Danbury, Connecticut and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. At that time the service has been cut down to one train per week. In the meantime, the New Haven and Derby Railroad was chartered in 1864 to run from New Haven west to Derby, Connecticut, and north to Ansonia, planned as part of the route over the never-built Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge. It opened in 1871. On November 14, 1888, a 3.79-mile (6.10 km) extension from Derby Junction to a point in Shelton was opened. The rest of the extension, 9.79 mi (15.76 km) from that point to the Housatonic Railroad at Botsford, was built by the Housatonic and opened on November 28. On July 9, 1889, the Housatonic leased the New Haven and Derby. On July 1, 1892, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the Housatonic, forming the Berkshire Division; it was merged on March 29, 1898. =New Haven's Berkshire Division: 1892-1969= Weekend New York-Pittsfield train on the New Haven's Berkshire Division, October 13, 1968 By the end of the New Haven's life, the Housatonic's original main line had been abandoned south of Botsford, where the old New Haven branch ran only east to Derby. The main line was also gone between Brookfield and Hawleyville, with traffic using the branch to Danbury and old New York and New England Railroad. The Danbury and Norwalk was still in use, but most branches, including the original main line to State Line, Massachusetts, were gone. On January 1, 1969 the New Haven was merged into Penn Central, which named the lines as follows: *Pittsfield Branch: Berkshire Junction near Danbury north to Pittsfield *Maybrook Branch: Derby Junction west via Danbury and other New Haven lines to Campbell Hall, New York *Danbury Branch: Danbury and Norwalk Railroad =Penn Central and Conrail: 1969-1983= The last passenger train ran over the route on April 30, 1971, the day before Amtrak took over Penn Central's passenger operations. At that time, the travel time from Danbury to Pittsfield required two hours and 45 minutes. By 1974 the middle section was abandoned, between Boardman Bridge in New Milford and Canaan, Connecticut, and was not made part of Conrail on April 1, 1976, instead being bought by the State of Connecticut. In 1982 the Boston and Maine Railroad bought the line north of Canaan, renaming it the Canaan Running Track. Conrail continued to operate the line south of New Milford, and the old Danbury and Norwalk Railroad was conveyed to the Metro-North Commuter Railroad on January 1, 1983, becoming their Danbury Branch. The New Housatonic Railroad (1983-present) Housatonic Railroad EMD GP35 #3604 at Canaan CT in 2004 A new Housatonic Railroad was chartered in 1983 by John Hanlon, Jr. to lease 34 miles of the former line, from Boardman Bridge in New Milford north to Canaan, Connecticut, from the State of Connecticut. Excursion trains began operating between Canaan and just south of Cornwall Bridge (at Belsprings Siding) in November 1984. The rest of the line, south into New Milford, was made serviceable in 1989, giving the company two connections - the Boston and Maine Railroad (Guilford Rail System) in Canaan and Conrail in New Milford. In April the Housatonic began to serve Becton, Dickinson and Company, a plastics plant in Canaan, but almost immediately the line was severed at Falls Village by a washout, not repaired until 14 months later. =Expansion into Massachusetts and New York= The Housatonic Transportation Company was incorporated in Delaware on January 2, 1991 as a holding company for the railroad's properties, including the newly formed Danbury Terminal Railroad (an operating company) and Maybrook Properties (a land-owning company). That month the Housatonic bought the connecting Guilford trackage (Canaan Running Track) north to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where it obtained another interchange with Conrail. In December 1992 the Danbury Terminal Railroad acquired trackage and rights belonging to Conrail in southwestern Connecticut and southeastern New York. Maybrook Properties bought the former New Haven line (then the Danbury Secondary Track) from Beacon, New York (MP 0.0), east to Hopewell Junction (MP 12.8) (former Newburg, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad), Hopewell Junction (MP 42.9) east to Derby, Connecticut (MP 104.8), (former Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, Housatonic Railroad and branch to Derby). The Danbury Terminal operated this Maybrook Properties-owned trackage. The Danbury Terminal also obtained Conrail's former trackage rights to serve freight on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad's Harlem Line from White Plains (MP 22.0) to Dover Plains (MP 76.6), and north to Wassaic (MP 81.6) over trackage still owned by the New York and Harlem Railroad and leased to Conrail, crossing the east-west line at Dykemans. Finally, it obtained overhead trackage rights over Metro-North's Waterbury Branch from the east end of this line at Derby (MP 8.9) south to Devon, Connecticut (MP 0.0), (operated for freight by the Providence and Worcester Railroad). The Housatonic also acquired the final part of the main line, from New Milford south to the east-west line at Berkshire Junction near Danbury. With this acquisition, the Housatonic gained a much expanded system and several new customers. These new acquisitions were first operated January 2, 1993. While freight customers remained on Metro-North's Harlem Line, the HRRC was not allowed to serve them directly. A few freight shipments were forwarded from Danbury by Metro-North crews, but this arrangement was only temporary until the remaining customers converted to truck transportation. On December 31, 1996, the Danbury Terminal Railroad was merged into the Housatonic Railroad. In 1984, the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum began operating passenger excursions between Lee and Great Barrington, over tracks owned by the Housatonic Railroad. Due to deteriorating track conditions, passenger operations were suspended in 1989. The museum successfully campaigned for state assistance funds to upgrade the tracks. The excursion trains returned in 2003, based out of the restored station in Lenox, with regular schedules to Lee and Stockbridge. =Excursions end, freight shipments decline= In 2008 HRRC considering the possibility of resuming commercial passenger service along the entire line from Danbury to Pittsfield, and in May 2010 began a formal study of the same. The estimated cost of upgrading the railroad to support passenger trains was estimated to be between $100 million and $150 million, not including the cost of the required equipment. In 2011, the Housatonic Railroad decided it would not renew its agreement with BSRM to continue operating passenger excursions over their railroad. Colin Pease, spokesperson for HRRC, said, \\"The Housatonic Railroad has determined that the continued operation of the Berkshire Scenic Railway on Housatonic-owned tracks is no longer possible.\\" Despite millions invested by the state, track conditions grew worse and freight shipments declined. In July 2014, Massachusetts Department of Transportation's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of 37 miles of the railroad's Berkshire Line. MassDOT's purchase is intended to extend rail services to New York City, following track improvements for passenger and freight service between Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Entrance. The Residencia de Estudiantes, literally the \\"Student Residence\\", is a centre of Spanish cultural life in Madrid. The Residence was founded to provide accommodation for students along the lines of classic colleges at Bologna, Salamanca, Cambridge or Oxford. It became established as a cultural institution that helped foster and create the intellectual environment of Spain's brightest young thinkers, writers, and artists. The students there included Salvador Dal√≠, Luis Bu√±uel and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Distinguished guests and speakers included Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez or Rafael Alberti. It was one of the most vibrant and successful experiences of scientific and artistic creation and exchange of interwar Europe. Its activities were stopped during the Spanish Civil War. After the civil war the academic policies of Francoist Spain created around the Residencia de Estudiantes the Spanish National Research Council, where it was integrated as the guest house. Since Spain's transition to democracy, efforts have been made to reinvigorate the institution. History The Residencia de Estudiantes was founded in Madrid in 1910 by the Junta para Ampliaci√≥n de Estudios. It became the first cultural center of Spain and until 1936 the Residencia remained a vibrant, fruitful hub for scientific and artistic work and exchange in Europe. In 1915, it was moved to its permanent site, the Hill of Poplars. Its director, Alberto Jim√©nez Fraud, ran the Residencia as a meeting place open to creativity, intellectual and interdisciplinary dialogue. The Residencia and the Junta para Ampliaci√≥n de Estudios were the product of the innovative ideas generated by the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza, founded by Francisco Giner de los R√≠os in 1876. The mission of the Residencia was to complement university education by fostering an exciting intellectual and living environment for its students. It strongly encouraged the constant dialogue between Science and the Arts, welcomed the avant-garde ideas from abroad, and became the focal point for spreading modernity in Spain. Some of its residents were among the leading figures of Spanish culture in the twentieth century, such as the poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, the painter Salvador Dal√≠, the film maker Luis Bu√±uel, and the Nobel Prize winner, scientist Severo Ochoa. Writers and artists such as Miguel de Unamuno, Alfonso Reyes, Manuel de Falla, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Pedro Salinas, Blas Cabrera, Eugenio d¬¥Ors and Rafael Alberti were frequent visitors and lodged at the Residencia during their stay in Madrid.  Notable guests  The Residencia was also a forum for discussion and dissemination of intellectual ideas in Europe. Many prominent figures came to the Residencia for that purpose, people such as Albert Einstein, Paul Val√©ry, Marie Curie, Igor Stravinsky, John M. Keynes, Alexander Calder, Walter Gropius, Henri Bergson and Le Corbusier. These personalities were often invited by two private associations, the Sociedad de Cursos y Conferencias and the Comit√© Hispano-ingl√©s, which worked closely with the Residencia and served as link to a broader sector of society.  Spain's \\"Silver Age\\"  The first decades of the twentieth century in Spain are known as the Silver Age - a period of rich intellectual expansion of ideas, when words and images gained a new power of expression, both artistically and politically. This Silver Age is divided into three generations: *Generation of '98 *Generation of '14 *Generation of '27 The influence of the Residencia de Estudiantes was particularly strong from its foundation in 1910 until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. During this time, many Spanish artists and writers, members of the Generation of '98 and Generation of '27, visited, studied and lectured at the Residence, including Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Luis Bu√±uel, Juan Cazador, Salvador Dal√≠, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Rafael Alberti, D√°maso Alonso, Luis Cernuda, Miguel de Unamuno, Antonio Machado and Ram√≥n del Valle-Incl√°n, and other innovative thinkers such as Albert Einstein, Howard Carter, Gilbert Keith Chesterton, Paul Val√©ry, Marie Curie, Igor Stravinski, Paul Claudel, Louis de Broglie, Herbert George Wells, Max Jacob, Le Corbusier, John Maynard Keynes, etc. The Residencia was one of the most important institutions of the time because it allowed the great thinkers of the time to come together and fulfil their enlightened ideas. The intellectuals at the Residencia de Estudiantes also began an institution known as tertulias - groups of artists and writers who would gather together daily, during day or night, at cafes, bars and houses to discuss their ideas and opinions. The Spanish Civil War indicated an end to this intellectual period. Scientific progress was derailed; many artists and writers were exiled from the country, and censorship increased in Francoist Spain.  Today  Nowadays, the Residencia de Estudiantes is one of the most prominent cultural centres in the city of Madrid. It hosts concerts, conferences and exhibitions. In 2015, the Residencia de Estudiantes was awarded the European Union‚Äôs European Heritage Label due to the significant role it has played in the history and culture of Europe. The Residencia de Estudiantes is also inhabited by around 20 young outstanding artists and researchers, which keep alive the historical legacy of this place. Some of these prestigious creators are Mercedes Cebri√°n, David Mayor, Miguel √Ålvarez-Fern√°ndez, Joaqu√≠n P√©rez Aza√∫stre, and Eva Mendoza. Today, the Residencia is again a unique center in Spain‚Äôs cultural life. The Spanish State through an independent foundation manages and owns the Residencia, which is one of the associated research bodies of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). Trustees of the Residencia include government officials at the state, regional and local level, as well as notorious private benefactors. The Residencia's honorary president is the Prince of Asturias. All throughout the year, the Residencia organizes numerous public events with the participation of leading figures in the Arts and Sciences, such as Mario Vargas Llosa, Pierre Boulez, Martinus Veltman, Ram√≥n Margalef, Jacques Derrida, Blanca Varela and Massimo Cacciari, among others. Conferences, workshops, round-table discussions, concerts, poetry readings, exhibitions, etc., make the Residencia a place for open debate, critical thinking and creativity, centered on the trends of our times. Each year, over 3,000 scholars, artists and other professionals from all over the world live for short periods of time in the Residencia. The Centro de Documentaci√≥n (library and archives) holds a unique collection of documents and books, with especial emphasis on the intellectual and scientific history of Spain during the first third of the twentieth century. These documents include the private archives of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Luis Cernuda, Jes√∫s del Bal y Gay, Fernando de los R√≠os and Le√≥n S√°nchez Cuesta. The archives of the Junta para la Ampliaci√≥n de Estudios and the Museo Pedag√≥gico Nacional are also kept here. Descriptions of those documents, the library and digitalized materials are available on the Red de Centros and Archivo Virtual de la Edad de Plata de la cultura espa√±ola (1868‚Äì1936 ), a project led by the Residencia with financial support from the Fundaci√≥n Marcelino Bot√≠n. The Residencia is currently developing several research projects focused on two main areas: the study and dissemination of the archives and the analysis of current intellectual trends in order to explore how our culture is evolving and where is it going. In 1990, the Residencia re-established its publishing house, which publishes research works, critical editions of the historical texts kept in its archives, poetry readings, lecturers and seminars held at the Residencia. Exceptional testimonies, such as the Archivo de la Palabra and the periodical Residencia are among its publications. Media interest The biopic Little Ashes (2009) depicts the Residencia in the 1920s, and the relationship of Lorca, Dal√≠, and Bu√±uel who were there at the time.

Family head of and partner of Demasduwit, born on the island of Newfoundland (present-day Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada). Sometimes referred to as Chief Nonosbawsut, his stature within the last remaining Beothuk would better be described as that of a headman or leader. Biography Nonosbawsut was one of a group of Beothuk who was encountered by David Buchan on January 24, 1811 at Red Indian Lake. Buchan had left two marines at the native camp while he, Nonosbawsut and three other Beothuk went to retrieve a cache of presents Buchan had left behind. Fearing the worst, Nonosbawsut became suspicious of being captured; he and the two Beothuks fled. While back at the camp they had convinced the rest of the group that the intentions of Buchan and his marines were hostile. The two marines were beheaded and the camp was then dispersed. Another expedition authorized by Governor Charles Hamilton to recover stolen property was led by John Peyton Jr. in March 1819. Apparently some items were stolen by the Beothuk from nearby fishing stations in the Bay of Exploits. The fate of the last remaining Beothuk was very much a concern at that time and the expedition was also requested to establish friendly relations with them. On March 5 the party of Peyton's armed soldiers had surprised a small party of Beothuk at Red Indian Lake who attempted to escape. Peyton captured Demasduwit, the wife of Nonosbawsut. Nonosbawsut approached the party of armed men holding the tip of a pine branch, a symbol of peace, and through words and gestures asked Peyton to release the Demasduwit. A scuffle broke out when Peyton had refused to release her, and Nonosbawsut was shot and killed. Later, Peyton and his men were absolved of Nonosbawsut's murder by a grand jury in St. John's, the judge concluding that \\"... (there was) no malice on the part of Peyton's party to get possession of any of (the Indians) by such violence as would occasion bloodshed.\\" Nonosbawsut's body was placed in a sepulchre, later to be joined by his infant son and eventually Demasduwit herself. Legacy In 1828, the sepulchre was found by William Cormack, who at that time removed the skulls and some of the grave goods. Among the items taken by Cormack was Nonosbawsut's skull which was sent to the Royal Museum, Edinburgh, Scotland. Genetic testing In 2007, DNA testing was conducted on material from the teeth of Nonosbawsut and his wife Demasduit. The results assigned them to Haplogroup C (mtDNA) and Haplogroup X (mtDNA), respectively, which are also found in current Mi'kmaq populations in Newfoundland.

It consists of a mosaic of sand dunes rising about above low peat bogs that lie between the dunes. The barrens are covered with mixed northern hardwood forests, meadows, and wetlands. About are protected in conservation preserves. Pine barrens are typical of seacoasts; the Rome Sand Plains is one of only a handful of inland pine barrens remaining in the United States. A second inland pine barrens, the Albany Pine Bush, is also found in New York, located north and west of state's capital Albany. E. W. Russell has described the Sand Plains as follows, \\"The landscape today forms a sharp contrast with the surrounding flat, fertile farmland, which is almost all cleared of trees and planted in crops. Uplands, including some dunes, support forest vegetation of American beech, white oak (Quercus alba), red and sugar maples, white and pitch pine (Pinus strobus and P. rigida), gray birch (Betula populifolia), hemlock, aspen (Populus spp.), American elm, and other northern hardwood species. Some uplands are also characterized as pitch pine heaths, dominated by pitch pines with an understory of blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) and other related (ericaceous) shrubs. Pitch pine is the characteristic tree of the wetlands, along with aspen, gray birch, and red maple, along with an ericaceous shrub layer.\\" Among the several rare species in the Sand Plains are the purple pitcher plant and a sundew (both of which are carnivorous plants), red-shouldered hawks, martens, and the frosted elfin butterfly, which is a threatened species in New York State. Other species to be found include wild blue lupine (also rare, and the food for the frosted elfin), barrens buckmoth (Hemileuca maia), whippoorwill, pine warbler and pitch pine, normally indigenous to coastal areas. The Rome Sand Plains were owned privately through about 1980. The sand was mined to make molds and cores for metal casting. An application for a permit to mine sand around 1980 triggered a regional effort to protect the area. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) began purchasing lands, working with The Nature Conservancy and other organizations. Approximately of the Sand Plains have been purchased by the NYSDEC, and are designated as the Rome Sand Plains Unique Area. The Nature Conservancy holds another . The Izaak Walton League holds about , Oneida County holds an additional as a County Forest, and a few acres are held by the City of Rome. A map showing these holdings was released by the NYSDEC in 2008; the map shows the location of three foot trails maintained by the NYSDEC and one by the Izaak Walton League. A consolidated management plan involving all five preserves, and addressing the entire Sand Plains area, was published in 2006. The sand plains are considered by geologists to be a relic of Lake Iroquois, which was a somewhat larger version of the present Lake Ontario that existed near the end of the last ice age about twelve thousand years ago. The level of Lake Iroquois was about higher than Lake Ontario's present level. Lake Iroquois drained to the Atlantic Ocean through the Mohawk and Hudson rivers, and its outlet was near the present Sand Plains. The work of Anderson and Lewis (1985) is the basis for these authors' views on the history of the post-glacial water levels. Lake Ontario's outlet is near the Thousand Islands, and the lake drains through the Saint Lawrence River; this outlet was dammed by ice in the period when Lake Iroquois existed.

He played college football at Boston College. Early years Born in Prienzing near Cham, Bavaria in Germany, Stautner's family immigrated to East Greenbush, New York when he was three years old. He attended Columbia High School and the Vincentian Institute. He served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II (1943-46). After the war, he enrolled at Boston College, where he was a four-year starter as an offensive and defensive tackle. He also handled the team's kickoff and extra point duties. One of his teammates was future Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Donovan. He earned a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1950. In 1973, he was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career Stautner was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round (22nd overall) of the 1950 NFL Draft. He played his entire career with the Steelers from 1950 to 1963. Despite being small even for his day at 6-1 and 235 pounds, he distinguished himself as one of the best defensive linemen of his era as he became the cornerstone of the Steelers bruising defense. He was named to nine Pro Bowls in his 14-year career and only missed six games. He also made All- NFL in 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959. He retired as the career leader in safeties with 3 and ranked third in fumble recoveries with 23. He moved to defensive end in the later years of his career and also saw spot service at offensive guard. In the book Passion for Sports by The Sporting News, former teammate Andy Russell shares an anecdote that highlights Stautner's elite toughness. Russell, then a rookie playing on a team that would eventually finish in fourth place in what would be Stautner's final season, sees the grizzled veteran return to the huddle holding one of his hands in the other. Russell looks down and sees that Stautner has a compound fracture of the thumb; one of his thumb bones is visibly sticking out of his skin. Russell is the only one who notices, and Stautner says only, \\"What's the play?\\" Then he plays the rest of the defensive series. When the defense returns to the sideline, Russell watches Stautner, thinking that surely he must seek medical attention now. Instead, Stautner says to someone, \\"Give me some tape.\\" Then Stautner taped up his hand into a club, and he played the rest of the game. The NFL didn't recognize quarterback sacks as an official stat at the time he retired, but he still finished with 3 career safeties (tied for the lead in league history) and 23 recovered fumbles (third in league history). The Steelers never made the playoffs during his career. He only missed 6 games during his 14-year career, despite suffering multiple cracked ribs, nose fractures, broken fingers and 2 broken shoulders. On October 25, 1964, Stautner became the first player to have his number (70) formally retired by the Steelers. He was elected to the Steelers 50th anniversary team in 1982 and posthumously by the Pittsburgh Steeler fans to the Steelers 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in November 2007. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the Steelers' Hall of Honor in 2017. On September 13, 1969, Stautner was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Coaching career From 1963 to 1964 he was a player-coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers. In 1965 he was the defensive line coach for the Washington Redskins. From 1966 to 1988, he was an assistant coach with the Dallas Cowboys, and served as the team's defensive coordinator from 1973 to 1988. He was instrumental in the development of defensive players such as Randy White and Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones. He also contributed to the emergence of the team's famed \\"Doomsday\\" and \\"Doomsday II\\" defenses. Stautner stayed on with the Cowboys from 1988 to 1989 as a scout. He coached the Dallas Texans, an Arena Football League team in their first season of play in 1990, guiding the franchise to an appearance in the ArenaBowl IV and earning the league‚Äôs Coach-of-the-Year award. Stautner was the defensive line coach for the Denver Broncos from 1991 to 1994. While with the Broncos, he coached under both Dan Reeves and Wade Phillips. From 1995 to 1997, he returned to Germany to become head coach of the Frankfurt Galaxy of NFL Europe. He would guide the team to two consecutive World Bowls in 1995 and 1996, winning in 1995. Head coaching recordPersonal life Stautner died at a Carbondale, Colorado nursing home at age 80 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He is buried in Texas.

The band formed in 1998 and disbanded in 2013. Biography Cataract was formed in 1998 by guitarist Simon F√ºllemann, guitarist Greg M√§der and drummer Ricky D√ºrst. Their first self-titled demo was recorded in six hours and mixed in another four hours in the bed room of vocalist Christian 'Mosh' Ebert. This hardcore/metal demo CD sold over 2000 copies. Cataract recorded their first album Golem with producer Alessandro Azzali in April 2000, the Ferret Music label got to listen to it and released Golem onto the hardcore punk/metal community in December that year.

The band played at Hellfest, and various shows with Poison The Well, Bane, Unearth, NORA, 18 Visions and Most Precious Blood on Cataract's first US tour. Most of 2002 was dedicated to working on the second full-length album, Great Days of Vengeance, which was released through Lifeforce Records in March 2003. The new album was more metal oriented than Golem. Cataract caught the attention of Metal Blade Records and was ultimately signed to their roster in 2004. In March they entered the Antfarm Studios and worked on their next release with producer Tue Madsen. With Triumph Comes Loss was welcomed warmly thanks to the aggressive sound and the groovy songs. The release was followed by a multitude of festivals and weekend trips to promote the album. In May 2006 Cataract released Kingdom, the band's fourth full-length album.

She was built in 1932 as a replica of a cod fishing vessel used off Iceland, as a training ship of the students of the √âcole navale. During the Second World War, Belle Poule sailed to the United Kingdom after the Fall of France and was used by the Free French Naval Forces, returning to Brest in 1945. The schooner as well as her sister ship are still used by the √âcole Navale as training ships in European waters. Design and construction In the early 20th century, the French Navy scrapped its aging traditional sailing ships, in 1904, and Borda in 1914. In the following years, it emerged that student officers would benefit from at least some sailing training. Since it would consist only in short cruises around Brest rather than long cruises, the school decided not to build a three-masted ship. Instead, it chose a replica of a cod fishing schooner, which had the advantage of being both maneuverable, and strong enough to sustain the weather of the winter around Brest. in 1931, the Ministry of the Navy ordered two such ships, as to allow enough of the students to embark at the same time. The first was Belle Poule, and the second, . The Navy ordered the ships from Chantiers de Normandie at Fecamp. Construction was supervised by Lieutenant Richard for the Navy, and engineers Chantelot and Lemaistre for the shipyard. The ships could accommodated 30 student officers, 5 petty officers 12 seamen and 3 officers. Construction of Belle Poule began in late July 1931, and she was launched on 8 February 1932. During her trials, Belle Poule managed on engines. With sails, she achieved close-hauled and broad reach.  Characteristics  FNFL flag, still flown today. Belle Poule is a replica of a type of fishing vessel that was used until 1935 off Iceland for catching cod. The ship has a standard displacement of and at full load. The schooner is long with a beam of and a draught of . Belle Poule is propelled by of sails and an auxiliary Baudouin DNP 8 diesel engine turning one shaft rated at , replacing her original a Sulzer diesel engine, rated at . Her maximum speed in on diesel engine. The propeller has only two blades, and can be stopped and locked vertically, as not to hinder the nautical qualities of the hull. As a former ship of the Free French Naval Forces (French: Forces Navales Fran√ßaises Libres, or FNFL), Belle Poule still flies the flag with the Cross of Loraine in honour of her role during the Second World War. Career From September 1932 Belle Poule and √âtoile served with the √âcole navale in their normal role. In the morning of 18 June 1940, Lieutenant-Commander Cros, in charge of both schooners, was ordered to prepare for evacuating the students of the school in the face of the German invasion. By 1400, both ships were manned, and they departed at 1500. At 1700, they had joined Pr√©sident- Th√©odore-Tissier, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric and Notre-Dame-de-France. The ships crossed the English Channel during the night, and arrived at Falmouth on 19 June around 1700. The British boarded Belle Poule in the night of 2 July as part of Operation Catapult, taking the French personnel prisoner. They restituted the ships to the FNFL on 20 September. Both ships were demagnetised as a precaution against mines, and armed with two Hotchkiss Mle 1914 machine guns. On 16 November 1940, Belle Poule and √âtoile left Falmouth and sailed to Portsmouth to join the Free French naval school, held on Pr√©sident-Th√©odore- Tissier. On 18 November, they came under attack from a bomber, but the four bombs that it released fell hundreds of metres away and did not cause damage. From November 1940, Belle Poule sailed each day of the week to train gunners, helmsmen, gabiers and commandos for the FNFL and for the Royal Navy, with Ensign Walmeyer acting as a liaison officer. Because she was moored next to the battleship , Belle Poule was regularly under attack from German planes. On 10 January 1941, she sustained two hits from incendiary bombs, and an officer, Blonsard, was seriously wounded fighting the fire. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth paid the ships a visit, and Blonsard was awarded the Croix de Guerre for saving Belle Poule. On 15 April 1944, Belle Poule and √âtoile departed for West Hartlepool, √âtoile towing Belle Poule for most of the journey due to an engine failure. They arrived on 13 May and were placed in reserve. In late September 1945, Belle Poule and √âtoile returned to Brest. From October they were appointed to the √âcole navale again, but were in such bad condition that they stayed under refit until mid-1947. Their engines were replaced with Deutz AG engines taken from German trucks. Belle Poule and √âtoile now sail around Brest during the winter, and occasionally participate in meetings during the summer, mainly in European waters. In 1975, they had a refit, and the engines were replaced with Baudoin DNP8. In 2009, they crossed the Atlantic to New York. Since 13 May 1978 Belle Poule has been sponsored by the city of Pauillac. Belle Poule underwent a refit in 2006.

The neighborhood is named after the Meyer family, who bought and owned 6,000 acres (24 km¬≤) of land in southwest Houston. Meyerland is the center of Houston's Jewish community; the Meyerland area is the home of Houston's Jewish Community Center, Congregation Beth Israel, Congregation Beth Yeshurun, and several smaller synagogues. The area is also home to Meyerland Plaza, a large outdoor shopping center. Meyerland is almost entirely located within the 100-year floodplain, and houses are prone to flooding during heavy rain events. Meyerland was inundated during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and stories and images of the flooded community were prominent in media coverage of the natural disaster in Houston. Large scale flood mitigation projects are underway which will greatly benefit Meyerland. Chief amongst such projects is Project Brays, a $400m mega scale flood mitigation project which will remove several Meyerland homes from 100 year flood plain. Circa 2018 several new homes are being built in Meyerland and the neighborhood is seeing strong new home construction. Luxury homes over $1m in value are being built several feet above the minimum base flood elevation. History The subdivision was formerly rice fields. Joseph F. Meyer Sr. originally acquired the land in sections beginning around 1885. The land was unused for many years, although part of it was leased to farmers and cattlemen. Joseph Meyer was confident that one day his holdings would be within the Houston city limits. After Joseph‚Äôs death in 1933, the land was divided among his three sons, George, Frank and Joseph Jr. It was not until 20 years after the father‚Äôs death that George Meyer decided to develop his share of the land.

The bank initially believed it lost $62,211, which would have made it the most severe bank robbery in Houston at the time. The bank staff later realized that $13,000 of that was in the wrong location and was not in fact stolen, which meant it was Houston's second-most severe bank robbery. According to Chris Lane of the Houston Press, while many Houston neighborhoods that were considered desirable in 2014 had experienced a period of decline before being gentrified, Meyerland itself had never declined even though Meyerland Plaza had experienced turmoil in the 1980s.

A string of over twelve robberies affected Meyerland from April 23, 1989 until June 19, 1989. On June 20, 1989 a suspect, Timothy Dion Morant, had been arrested, and confessed to the crime spree. The group of robbers targeted Meyerland since the houses had valuables, and the community was in proximity to the 610 Loop and other major thoroughfares, providing easy avenues for escape.

In December 1991, before Christmas, an HISD document was given to an attendance boundary committee convened by the district. The document, labeled as a \\"draft\\", illustrated Meyerland being moved into the attendance zone of Westbury High School. This caused panic in Meyerland as the community feared that moving to Westbury, which was less prestigious than Bellaire High, would cause a decrease in property values. On May 21, 1992, the HISD board adopted attendance boundary committee recommendations stating that the Bellaire High attendance zone would not be altered.McAdams, p. 55. Bellaire High School was remodeled in the 1992-1993 period. The current Herod Elementary building opened in mid-January 2011. The current Lovett building opened in August 2011. The rebuilds of Herod, Lovett, and Horn Elementary of Bellaire together had a cost of $49 million and were a part of a $1 billion bond program approved by HISD voters in 2007.Foster, Robin. \\"Horn, Herod and Lovett schools benefit from upgrades .\\" Houston Chronicle.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the fifth written by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was Illustrated by John R. Neill. Thompson's approach As she sometimes does in her books,David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 61. Thompson exploits a detail in Baum's work to generate her story. Baum mentions Pastoria, Ozma's father and former ruler of Oz,Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 156. only briefly in the twentieth chapter of The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904); Thompson spins Baum's hint into a full tale of Pastoria's exile and rescue. Thompson dedicated The Lost King of Oz to her invalid mother. She suggested to her publishers that the dedication be made in the form of a crossword puzzle -- but Reilly & Lee rejected the idea.Greene and Martin, p. 72. Plot summary Old Mombi, formerly the Wicked Witch of the North, is now a cook in the land of Kimbaloo. One day she comes across Pajuka, the former prime minister of Oz, transformed by Mombi into a goose years before. She sets out to find Pastoria, the king of Oz, whom she also enchanted in the past. However, she has forgotten what shape she transformed Pastoria into. She kidnaps a local boy called Snip as her unwilling assistant and bearer of burdens. Eventually deciding, however, that he knows too much, Mombi throws Snip down a well; he ends up in Blankenburg, populated by the invisible Blanks. Snip meets and soon rescues Tora, an amnesiac old tailor. Tora has been held prisoner for many years by the Blanks, to do their tailoring; he has compensated by sending his detachable ears flying about the countryside to hear the news. Meanwhile, Dorothy is accidentally transported to Hollywood, where she meets Humpy, a live stunt dummy, whom she brings back to Oz. They escape the Back Talkers in Eht Kcab Sdoow (by running backwards), and meet the Scooters who help scoot them on their way. Kabumpo the Elegant Elephant shows up to provide transport (of the mandane sort). Dorothy's party encounters Snip and Tora, and Mombi and Pajuka too. They come to the conclusion that Humpy the dummy is the enchanted Pastoria. Eventually, matters are clarified and settled: Pajuka is restored to humanity, but Humpy proves not to be the missing king after all. Old Tora is disenchanted and turns out to be Pastoria. He spurns any notion of returning to his throne, however; he is content to settle down as a humble tailor in the Emerald City, with Snip as his apprentice and Humpy as his tailor's dummy. In a rare act of Ozite capital punishment, Mombi is ruthlessly doused with water and melts away like the Wicked Witch of the West, so that nothing is left of her but her buckled shoes. Promotion Reilly & Lee took a new approach to publicizing its Oz books in 1925. Thompson wrote a short play for child actors titled A Day in Oz, with songs composed by Norman Sherrerd. The play was performed in bookstores and department stores by local children, with costumes provided by Reilly & Lee. The performances promoted each year's Oz book, and continued through the 1920s.Greene and Martin, p. 68.

Crime Pays Character timeline In Gorky Park, the first novel, he is a chief investigator for the Soviet Militsiya in Moscow, where he is in charge of homicide investigations. In the sequels, he takes on roles varying from a militiaman to a worker on a fish processing ship in the arctic. Born into the nomenklatura, Arkady is the son of Red Army General Kiril Renko, an unrepentant Stalinist also known as \\"the Butcher\\", who sees Arkady as a bitter failure for choosing the simple life of a policeman over a military career, or even a career in the Communist Party. Arkady was also never able to forgive himself for indirectly and unwittingly helping his mother commit suicide (he helped her gather the rocks she used to drown herself with in the lake at their family estate when he was a young boy). Wary of the official lies of Soviet society, Arkady exposes corruption and dishonesty on the part of influential and well-protected members of the elite, regardless of the consequences. When exposed to Western capitalist society, he finds it to be equally corrupt and returns to the Soviet Union. Despite this, and his own tough nature, he emerges as a man capable of displaying both compassion and a faith in the future. The first three books published between 1981 and 1992 form a trilogy culminating with the fall of the Soviet Union, at the August Coup in 1991. The action in Gorky Park takes place in the Soviet Union and in the US, Polar Star on board a Soviet fishing vessel in the Bering Sea, and Red Square in West Germany and the Glasnost-era Soviet Russia. Havana Bay is set in Cuba; Wolves Eat Dogs is set in Moscow and in the areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster.

The company also licenses brands such as BCBG Max Azria, Sean John, Kenneth Cole New York, JOE Joseph Abboud, and Michael Kors. PVH is partly named after Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen, who in 1910 invented a new process that fused cloth on a curve. Organization PVH is headquartered in Manhattan New York, with policy-making offices in Las Vegas, Nevada, Los Angeles, California and Bridgewater, New Jersey and handling plants in Reading, Pennsylvania, Brinkley, Arkansas, Jonesville, North Carolina, Chattanooga, Tennessee and McDonough, Georgia all in the United States. As of April 2014, globally, PVH had over 120,000 employees and was positioned in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Indonesia, Mongolia, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Honduras. In September 2020, PVH announced that Stefan Larsson will be named CEO on February 1, 2021, succeeding Emanuel Chirico, who remains as chairman. HistoryTrade names and early mergers= The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded the shirt manufacturing company D. Jones & Sons, c. 1857. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones & Sons merged with M. Phillips & Sons in 1907 under the name Phillips-Jones after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen), and in the subsequent acquisition of Van Heusen by Phillips-Jones and its renaming to Phillips-Van Heusen in 1957. In 2011, Phillips-Van Heusen is renamed to PVH. =Acquisitions= The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002. In 2004, PVH began manufacturing clothing for the Donald J. Trump Signature Collection as part of a licensing agreement with Donald Trump. After acquiring Superba, Inc., in January 2007, PVH now owns necktie licenses for brands such as Arrow, DKNY, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis, Ted Baker, Michael Kors, JOE Joseph Abboud, Original Penguin and Jones New York. The corporation began making men's clothing under the Timberland name in 2008, with women's clothing following in 2009, under a licensing agreement. On March 15, 2010, Phillips- Van Heusen acquired Tommy Hilfiger for $3 billion. In the third quarter of 2010 losses made on the \\"Van Heusen\\" brand led to the decision to pull it out of all European trading markets. the company sells no products under that name in Europe. All European staff became redundant as a result. In February 2013, PVH acquired Warnaco Group, which manufactured the Calvin Klein underwear, jeans and sportswear lines under license, thus consolidating control of the Calvin Klein brand. The Warnaco acquisition also added the Warner's and Olga intimate apparel brands, as well the Speedo swimwear brand (the latter in North America only). In November 2013 PVH sold the G.H. Bass brand and all of its assets, images and licenses to G-III Apparel Group. PVH ended its licensing agreement with Trump in July 2015, after Macy's discontinued sales of his Trump Signature Collection due to controversial comments that he made regarding illegal immigrants. In 2017 Forbes ranked PVH, 25 out of 890 companies on the \\"Just company\\" list. In March 2017, PVH acquired lingerie brand True & Co. In June 2018, PVH acquired the Geoffrey Beene clothing brand, which PVH previously produced under license. On August 28, 2018, PVH announced that it would expand the Izod brand to portions of Europe beginning with the Fall/Winter 2018 collection. In January 2020, PVH sold back the rights for the Speedo swimwear brand, previously marketed under \\"Speedo USA\\" and \\"Speedo North America\\", back to Speedo's international parent, the British Pentland Group. The deal was in exchange for $170 million in cash. Distribution PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, Belk, and Dillard's as well as online retailer Amazon both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, Tommy Hilfiger, and Calvin Klein. The Calvin Klein stores sell the full range of products at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. These stores are range from to . Phillips-Van Heusen closed its Geoffrey Beene outlet retail division in 2008. Approximately 25 percent of the Geoffrey Beene outlet stores became Calvin Klein stores, while the remaining 75 percent of stores closed entirely. The company continued to license the Geoffrey Beene brand name for Geoffrey Beene brand dress shirts and men's sportswear until 2018 when it acquired the brand outright. In 2015, PVH closed its Izod retail division due to an increasing competitive environment driven by more premium brands in the outlet retail channel; this did not affect Izod's wholesale business to department stores and online retailers. Select Izod products are now available at some Van Heusen stores; initially this only included the golf line, but now includes products from Izod's other lines (mostly from the Advantage and Saltwater lines). In July 2018, PVH launched a direct online sales platform on the Izod and Van Heusen websites where both brands are featured and can be cross-shopped on each other's site. On July 14, 2020, PVH announced that it would close its remaining Heritage Brands retail outlets operating mainly under the Van Heusen/Izod Golf names. The Izod and Van Heusen brands are not being discontinued; the wholesale business, which sells their product to department stores, warehouse clubs, and online retailers, is not affected. The fate of the Izod and Van Heusen online direct sales platform is currently unknown. Marketing In October 2007, PVH took over naming rights to the Meadowlands Sports Complex arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The arena's name was changed to the Izod Center, and the change became effective on October 31, 2007. PVH paid about $1.4 million a year for two years, then paid $750,000 a year and included the arena employees IZOD uniforms. In 2015 IZOD center was permanently closed. ControversyEnvironmental practices= In July 2011, PVH‚Äîalong with other major fashion and sportswear brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch‚Äîwas the subject of a report by the environmental group Greenpeace entitled \\"Dirty Laundry\\". PVH is accused of working with suppliers in China who, according to the findings of the report, contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, perfluorinated compounds, and perfluorooctane sulfonate. In 2020, PVH announced for its sustainability policy for its Izod and Van Heusen brands to eliminate single use plastic from packaging by 2024, use 100% sustainable cotton by 2021, and use 100% sustainable polyester and nylon by 2025. = Use of animals = Concerns have also arisen about PVH's practices with regards to animal testing. In 2020, PVH announced that as part of their animal welfare policy, the company does not use exotic skins and would be banning their use in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein collections when \\"our annual update of that policy is released.\\" Rosemary Feitelberg,\\"PVH Corp.

Released in November 2005, rFactor did not have much competition in this market, but it featured many technical advances in tire modeling, complex aerodynamics and a 15 degrees of freedom physics engine. rFactor was developed by Image Space Incorporated (ISI), which has been developing simulators since the early 1990s for both commercial and military purposes. The isiMotor2 on which the game is based is a direct successor to the engine used in previous titles developed by ISI, most notably F1 Challenge '99‚Äì'02, released through EA Sports. The isiMotor2 engine was also used in many other simulation games.  Gameplay  Two mods depicting a Formula 1 car skidding at the Lime Rock Park circuit rFactor has a detailed interface during offline race sessions or online games, allowing players to control the mechanical setup of their cars, chat to other players and enter the racing arena in their vehicle. The player's car can be driven from multiple viewpoints, but the two most popular are termed the cockpit view (from the driver's eye) and swingman view (above and behind the vehicle). Most players say vehicles are best controlled using a computer steering wheel, although a joystick or even keyboard can be used. The keyboard is also used for some actions, like requesting pit service and adjusting brake bias. This is analogous to buttons on modern racing car steering wheels and most computer wheels have buttons that can be mapped to keystrokes. The player can jump directly from the racetrack to the control interface by pressing the escape key (ESC), or entering their pit box.  Modding  In addition to the stock vehicles and circuits available in rFactor, a steady stream of unofficial mods has become available. A large number of modifications were released, including ones that recreated seasons from Formula One, NASCAR, IndyCar and V8 Supercars. Cars from the racing games Forza Motorsport, Need for Speed: Shift, Shift 2 Unleashed, Simulador Turismo Carretera, Top race 2009 Simulator, TC2000 Racing and Test Drive Unlimited were also converted into rFactor with the mod Shift Street. With the release of the SDK, many new venues were created and released as unofficial addons to the game. Many of the circuits for rFactor were converted from other games, including GTR, GT Legends, TOCA Race Driver, Grand Prix 4 and Grand Prix Legends.  Development  BMW Sauber vehicle in a promotional image rFactor is an evolution of F1 Challenge '99‚Äì'02, but without the licensing of Formula One circuits and teams. As such, rFactor's initial release only included four fictitious circuits (seven as of v1.087), with about a dozen layouts within these facilities and there were about six vehicle classes, including two open wheel and four sedan classes. Among its most notable features was a rich interface for creating custom game contents, which made it possible for amateurs to create additional vehicles and tracks for the game. On August 1, 2006, ISI released the full update, with many changes and new features, including the new 2006 BMW Sauber F1 and a much requested manual. Another notable and often requested feature was driver-swapping, which allowed to change drivers during the race, enabling up to 24 hour events like Le Mans. A feature was added to allow the AI to \\"learn a track\\", which teaches the AI the ideal way to drive a particular circuit. As of v1.150, the AI was improved, leading to notably faster driving styles. rFactor also advertises an advanced tire model, aiming to be much better than the Pacejka model previously used in most simulators. rFactor's tire model simulates a non-linear tire use cycle according to temperature and wear. F1 Challenge proved to be popular for online racing over the Internet through GameSpy, which allowed any player to find available games. rFactor has extended this in several ways. The central server is handled by ISI themselves, so finding other games is effectively the same. However, the central server will show all races and practice sessions over a web interface known as Racecast. There are also career statistics available for registered drivers. The game server can be run from a dedicated program, free from the need to render graphics. It can run mixtures of human and computer controlled (AI) vehicles. In an evolution from F1 Challenge, the circuits now include all layouts at a particular facility, which greatly reduces the need to duplicate track geometry. The game can easily accommodate different sorts of vehicles and games between multiple classes of vehicles are possible. rFactor also has a plugin-interface for third-party addons to hook in, which allows for features like screen-overlays or radio chatter.  Reception  In the first review of rFactor, published on AutoSimSport, Jon Denton stated: \\"What the tire model in rFactor does very well is that it models the relationship between slip angle, self aligning torque and cornering force - and it does this better than anything that has come before\\". Writing on HonestGamers, Paul Josua concluded: \\"It's a little unfair to hold rFactor's lack of accessibility against it as it has clearly set out to be a simulation racer. It does a fine job of that, but those who don't demand flawless simulation are better served looking elsewhere\\". rFactor was a finalist for PC Gamer US's \\"Best Racing Game 2005\\" award, which ultimately went to GTR: FIA GT Racing.  Sequel  In March 2009, ISI announced the development of rFactor 2, which includes weather effects, reflections and accurate shadows on a variety of textures. It was released on March 28, 2013.

She was built in 1932 as a replica of a cod fishing vessel used off Iceland, as a training ship of the students of the √âcole navale. During the Second World War, √âtoile sailed to the United Kingdom after the Fall of France and was used by the Free French Naval Forces, returning to Brest in 1945. The schooner as well as her sister ship are still used by the √âcole Navale as training ships in European waters. Description and design In the early 20th Century, the French Navy scrapped its aging traditional sailing ships, Melpom√®ne in 1904, and Borda in 1914. In the following years, it emerged that student officers would benefit from at least some sailing training. Since it would consist only in short cruises around Brest rather than long cruises, the school decided not to build a three-masted ship. Instead, it chose a replica of a cod fishing schooner, which had the advantage of being both maneuverable, and strong enough to sustain the weather of the winter around Brest. in 1931, the Ministry of the Navy ordered two such ships, as to allow enough of the students to embark at the same time. The first was Belle Poule, and the second, √âtoile. √âtoile was launched on 7 July 1932, at the unusual hour of 1 in the morning. Lieutenant Richard, who oversaw construction for the Navy, was worried that √âtoile would not be completed for the launch date, and had had an argument with Lemaistre, the engineer in charge of construction. Lemaistre proceeded to the launch in the night of the day chosen for the ceremony, and officials coming for the occasion were surprised to find √âtoile already afloat. Career From September 1932 Belle Poule and √âtoile served with the √âcole navale in their normal role. In the morning of 18 June 1940, Lieutenant- Commander Cros, in charge of both schooners, was ordered to prepare for evacuating the students of the school in the face of the Nazi invasion. By 1400, both ships were manned, and they departed at 1500. At 1700, they had joined ', Jean-Fr√©d√©ric and Notre-Dame-de-France. The ships crossed the Channel during the night, and arrived at Falmouth on 19 June around 1700. The British boarded Belle Poule in the night of 2 July as part of Operation Catapult, taking the French personnel prisoner. They restituted the ships to the FNFL on 20 September. Both ships were demagnetised as a precaution against mines, and armed with two 8mm Hotchkiss Mle 1914 machine guns. On 16 November 1940, the Belle Poule and √âtoile left Falmouth and sailed to Portsmouth to join the Free French naval school, held on Pr√©sident-Th√©odore-Tissier. On 18, they came under attack from a bomber plane, but the four bombs that it released fell hundreds of metres away and did not cause damage. From November 1940 √âtoile underwent a refit, when she was painted grey, and she was used as a store ship for the gunnery school HMS Excellent. On 15 April 1944, Belle Poule and √âtoile departed for West Hartlepool, √âtoile towing Belle Poule for most of the journey due to an engine failure. They arrived on 13 May and were put in the reserve. In late September 1945, Belle Poule and √âtoile returned to Brest. From October they were appointed to the √âcole navale again, but were in such bad condition that they stayed under refit until mid-1947. Their engines were replaced with 120-hp Deutz AG engines taken from German trucks. Belle Poule and √âtoile now sail around Brest during the winter, and occasionally participate in meetings during the summer, mainly in European waters. In 1975, they had a refit, and the engines were replaced with 245-shp Baudoin DNP8. In 2009, they crossed the Atlantic to New York.

During the course of World War I, he became a propagandist for MI7, in which role he held the rank of Major.Director 'M.I.7(b)(1)' from April ‚Äì November 1918 After the armistice, he alternated between Dublin and London during the Irish War of Independence as Information Officer for Dublin Castle, working closely with Lionel Curtis.The Administration of Ireland, 1920 Reprint, 2001 by Athol Books. Introduction by Dr. Pat Walsh p5 He later earned his living as a prolific writer of detective novels.  Novelist  John Street produced two long series of novels; one under the name of John Rhode, the majority featuring the academic Dr. Priestley,; another under the name of Miles Burton, the majority featuring the retired naval officer Desmond Merrion; and a third under the name Cecil Waye. The Dr. Priestley novels were among the first after Dr Thorndyke to feature scientific detection of crime, such as analysing the mud on a suspect's shoes. Desmond Merrion is an amateur detective who works with Scotland Yard's Inspector Arnold. Critic and author Julian Symons placed \\"John Rhode\\" as a prominent member of the \\"Humdrum\\" school of detective fiction. \\"Most of them came late to writing fiction, and few had much talent for it. They had some skill in constructing puzzles, nothing more, and ironically they fulfilled much better than S. S. Van Dine his dictum that the detective story properly belonged in the category of riddles or crossword puzzles. Most of the Humdrums were British, and among the best known of them were Major John Street ...\\". Symons' opinion has not however prevented the Rhode and Burton books becoming much sought after by collectors, and many of the early ones can command high prices. Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor in their A Catalogue of Crime offer a different perspective to Symons, praising several of the Rhode books in particular, though they only review a small proportion of the more than 140 novels written by Street. Curt Evans has written the only detailed account of Street's life and works: \\"I wrote my new book, Masters of the \\"Humdrum\\" Mystery: Cecil John Charles Street, Freeman Wills Crofts, Alfred Walter Stewart and the British Detective Novel, 1920‚Äì1961 (published by McFarland Press) in part to give a long overdue reappraisal of these purportedly \\"humdrum\\" detection writers as accomplished literary artists. Not only did they produce a goodly number of fine fair play puzzles, but their clever tales have more intrinsic interest as social documents and even sometimes as literary novels than they have been credited with having.\\" Bibliography This bibliography has been confirmed against a standard reference.

The development of DMI, 2.0 version June 24, 1998, marked the first move by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) into desktop-management standards. Before the introduction of DMI, no standardized source of information could provide details about components in a personal computer. Due to the rapid development of DMTF technologies, such as Common Information Model (CIM), the DMTF defined an \\"End of Life\\" process for DMI, which ended on March 31, 2005. From 1999, Microsoft required OEMs and BIOS vendors to support the DMI interface/data-set in order to have Microsoft certification. DMI and SMBIOS DMI exposes system data (including the System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) data) to management software, but the two specifications function independently. DMI is commonly confused with SMBIOS, which was actually called DMIBIOS in its first revisions. Optional additional services: MIF data and MIF routines When software queries a memory-resident agent that resides in the background, it responds by sending data in MIFs (Management Information Format) or activating MIF routines. Static data in a MIF would contain items such as model ID, serial number, memory- and port-addresses. A MIF routine could read memory and report its contents. DMI and SNMP DMI can co-exist with SNMP and other management protocols. For example, when an SNMP query arrives, DMI can fill out the SNMP MIB with data from its MIF. A single workstation or server can serve as a proxy agent that would contain the SNMP module and service an entire LAN segment of DMI-capable machines.

But in nearly every case Dr. Priestly's interest in the problem ceased when he had solved it to his own satisfaction. The fate of the criminal was a matter of complete unconcern to him. He treated detection much as he would have treated a game of chess. The pieces in the game had no more than a passing interest to him. Not that he was unsympathetic by nature, as many people had good cause to know. But, in the problems which Hanslet set before him, he purposely took a detached and impersonal attitude.

In later books Dr. Priestley becomes an armchair detective and the bulk of the legwork is done by Superintendent Jimmy Waghorn of Scotland Yard and Priestley's secretary and companion, Harold Merefield. Harold Merefield, whom Dr Priestley had cleared of a murder charge in the first book The Paddington Mystery, is engaged to Dr. Priestly's daughter April.

It won the American Institute of Steel Construction's Class \\"A\\" Award of Merit as the \\"Most Beautiful Steel Bridge\\" in 1934. Most traffic approaching from the west follows Massachusetts Route 25 which ends at the interchange with US 6 and Route 28 just north of the bridge. The highway provides freeway connections from Interstate 495 and Interstate 195. There is a six-foot wide sidewalk for pedestrian and bicycle access on the west side of the bridge. The sidewalk is slightly raised, but there is no fence or barrier between it and car traffic, and cyclists are recommended to walk their bicycle. The bridge road is plowed in winter, although the sidewalk is sometimes unplowed and unpassable. Bridges to the Cape are sometimes closed for safety during high winds. History The bridge and its sibling the Sagamore Bridge were constructed beginning in 1933 by the Public Works Administration for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which operates both the bridges and the canal. Each bridge carries four lanes of traffic over a 616-foot (188 m) main span, with a 135-foot (41 m) ship clearance. Construction ended in early 1935 and the bridge opened on June 22, 1935. The approaches to the main span of the Bourne Bridge are considerably longer than those of the Sagamore Bridge due to the topography of the land. The bridge replaces an earlier 1911 drawbridge, and the original drawbridge's approaches are still accessible. The current structure was built to accommodate the widening of the canal. The bridge commences at a major rotary on the Cape Cod end. On the mainland side, New York Central Tugboat 16 sat on dry land at the approach to the bridge from the rotary from 1982 to 2006, serving as a local attraction. In October 2019, the Army Corps of Engineers recommended replacing the bridge with a wider bridge with six travel lanes, bike and pedestrian paths, shoulders, and a median. The recommendation said that replacement was more cost-effective than upgrading the existing bridge in order to reduce long summertime backups.

During the 16th century, the Qom inhabited a large part of what is today northern Argentina, in the current provinces of Salta, Chaco, Santiago del Estero, Formosa and the province of Gran Chaco in the southeast of the Department of Tarija in Bolivia (which the Qom have inhabited since the 20th century). Currently, many Toba, due to persecution in their rural ancestral regions, live in the suburbs of San Ram√≥n de la Nueva Or√°n, Salta, Tartagal, Resistencia, Charata, Formosa, Rosario and Santa Fe and in Greater Buenos Aires. Nearly 130,000 people currently identify themselves as Toba or Qom. With more than 120,000 Qom living in Argentina, the Qom community is one of the largest indigenous communities in the country. Like most indigenous groups in South America, the Qom have a long history of conflict and struggle following the arrival of the Spanish. While the Qom incorporated some aspects of European society into their culture, such as horseback riding, violent conflicts were fairly common. The Toba people, in particular, opposed the ideas of Christianity and the systems of forced labor that were imposed upon the Qom during the lives at Jesuit reductions. In some cases, attempts to assimilate the Toba people to Spanish society were accomplished with force and, when met with resistance from the indigenous group, resulted in massacres such as the Massacre of Napalp√≠. In more recent history, the Qom have struggled with problems such as poverty, malnutrition, discrimination and Tuberculosis due to a lack of support from the community and the inequalities they have endured. In 2010, a historic protest for land rights developed in the province of Formosa when the government announced it would build a university on lands traditionally claimed by the Qom. After the Tobas' roadblock of National Route 86 was met with violence on behalf of the Argentine police, resulting in the death of one Toba man and one police officer, the protest sparked national controversy and attention. Led by chief F√©lix D√≠az, the Qom community, joined by other indigenous groups, began the Qopiwini organization and built an encampment in the middle of the city of Buenos Aires in order to continue protests and gain further recognition. While the protests have gained support from famous artists such as Gustavo Cordera, as well as international organizations such as Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Qom's struggle for land rights and the Formosa case is still developing. History Early history = An approximate map of the Chaco region where the Qom would have historically inhabited. At the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the Qom primarily inhabited the regions known today as Salta and Tarija and from there, Qom communities extended in territory until the Bermejo River and the Pilcomayo River, overlapping with other indigenous communities. The large demographic growth of the Wichi put pressure on the Qom and forced them to displace themselves farther east, to the territories that they largely inhabit today. Traditionally, the Qom and the Mocov√≠ peoples regarded each other as allies while the Abipon peoples were typically treated as enemies to the Qom.Saeger, J. (1999).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CHOL9780521630764.006 Like other Guaycuru peoples, the Qom organize themselves into bands composed by up to 60 families that would establish relationships with other bands. The principal groups among the Toba were the sheu‚Äôl‚Äôec who inhabited the northern or sheu region, the dapigueml‚Äôec who inhabited the western or dapiguem region, the l‚Äôa√±agashec who inhabited the southeastern or l‚Äôa√±aga region, the tacshic who inhabited the eastern or tague√±i region and the qollaxal‚Äôec who inhabited the southernmost region known as qollaxa.Wright, P. (1983, 1984). Nota sobre gentilicios toba. Relaciones de la Sociedad Argentina de Antropolog√≠a, 16, pp. 225-233. = Contact with Europeans = The first written record of Spanish interaction with the Qom appears at the beginning of the 1700s but no formal study of the Qom people was done until Father Jos√© Card√∫, a Spanish Franciscan missionary, estimated that there were at least 4,000 Tobas living in the western or dapiguem region. The first missionaries to make contact with the Qom did not immediately try to introduce them to an agricultural lifestyle, an approach that was adopted in almost every other part of Latin America in order to \\"civilize\\" the indigenous group. Instead, the limited resources and the difficulties presented by the landscape of the Chaco forced missionaries to accept the Qom's hunter-gatherer lifestyle as the only sustainable option. The presence of the Spanish resulted in a great revolution for the Qom, in part because the Qom encountered a new and powerful enemy and in part because the Spanish involuntarily provided the Qom with a great contribution to their culture: in the 17th century the Qom began to utilize horses and soon developed a powerful equestrian complex in the center and southern part of the Grand Chaco region, known as the Chaco Gualamba. The Qom became competent horsemen despite the fact that their territory was in large part covered in woodlands forests. When riding their horses through the trees the Qom used to fasten pieces of leather to their heads in order to prevent injuries from the spines of the trees and attacks from jaguars and pumas that would jump from the tree branches to attack them. As enemies of the Paraguayan state, on nights of the full moon, the Qom and other neighboring guaicurue groups would cross the Paraguay River on horse in order to carry out raids. With the adoption of horseback riding, the Qom could extend the reach of their raids, transforming themselves into the dominant indigenous group of the Central Chaco. Furthermore, their command of the horses permitted the Qom to advance further west and even conduct raids in the northeast zones that correspond to what is today known as the Pampas. From their horses, armed with bows and arrows, the Qom hunted not only indigenous animals but also cattle that had been imported from Europe. While the horse played a revolutionary role in changing the way in which the Qom travelled and participated in hunts and raids, some historians believe that some bands of Qom maintained more traditional hunting methods. Here, the Qom would use horses to approach their targets but would dismount and stalk their prey on foot in order to avoid notice. In 1756 the Jesuits founded the Toba reduction, San Ignacio de Ledesma, near the Ledesma fort in the province of Jujuy. At the time of the expulsion of the Jesuits from Latin America in 1768, there were 600 Qom living at the reduction. The Qom became one of the most resistant indigenous groups that opposed attempts at transculturation and usurpation of the white man in the Chaco region. Led by famous chiefs such as Tayolique, the Qom frequently used guns to oppose European intervention and continued to update their rifles in order to better defend themselves and their territory. In 1858, the Qom even threatened the city of Santa Fe. However, after 1880 they could not confront the Argentine Army that confined them to the so-called \\"Impenetrable Chaco\\", a densely forested area of the Chaco that was difficult to navigate and survive due to the scarcity of water. Communion at Misi√≥n Laish√≠ In 1901, the government, led by Julio Argentino Roca, as well as Franciscan missionaries from the convent of San Carlos Borromeo of San Lorenzo in Santa Fe agreed to found two indigenous reductions in the National Territory of Formosa. One of the missions, San Francisco Solano de Tacaagl√©, was initiated by the Franciscan friar Terence Marcucci on March 21, 1901 with 150 Qom and Pilag√° people largely coming from the northern Chaco in Paraguay. The mission occupied 20,000 hectares of land near the Pilcomayo River, inside of which the mission itself was moved various times. The second reduction, San Francisco de Laish√≠ was founded with the Qom people on March 25, 1901 in the southeast region of Formosa by Father Seraf√≠n Iturralde and Father Ghio. This mission was composed of 74,000 hectares of land in which there was a sugar factory that operated until 1946. When Formosa became an official province in 1955, the two missions were given civil control, resulting in the towns of Misi√≥n Tacaagl√© and San Francisco de Laish√≠. The indigenous people of the Gran Chaco, in general, maintained their sovereignty until the late 19th century. The conquest of the territory and the subjugation of their people during the Conquest of the Gran Chaco decimated the population. In the second half of the 20th century, when the Qom stopped working as agrarian labor, a massive expulsion of indigenous people from the area resulted. The first conquest over the territories began in 1884 and is remembered as the Conquest of the Gran Chaco. One of the principal protagonists of this campaign was General Victorica. During this mission that began in 1911, General Victoria led his men into the Chaco region, ultimately ending a revolt led by the Qom in 1916.Langer, Erick. (2002). The Eastern Andean Frontier (Bolivia and Argentina) and Latin American Frontiers: Comparative Contexts (19th and 20th Centuries). The Americas, 59(1), 33-63. Afterwards, the Qom remained marginalized in the poorest areas and as a result of the reduction in the size of their territories, survival became even harder. In 1924, when the government led by Marcelo Torquato de Alvear wanted to increase farming areas by giving land to foreigners and Creoles while concentrating the Qom on reservations, the Qom fought their last military resistance in the Indigenous Colony of Napalp√≠ in the province of Chaco.Lenton, Liana; Slavsky, Leonor; Bigot, Margot; Rodr√≠guez, Graciela B.; V√°zquez, H√©ctor; Tamagno, Liliana; Fraguas, Mim√≠; Radovich, Juan Carlos; \\"Problem√°tica ind√≠gena: estudios antropol√≥gicos sobre pueblos ind√≠genas de la Argentina\\"; Buenos Aires: Centro Editor de Am√©rica Latina, 1992 p 23. This battle resulted in the death of 200 Qom, an event that is known as the Massacre of Napalp√≠. Many Qom were forced to work on cotton plantations or in manufacturing plants. On July 19, 1924, during the presidency of Marcelo Torquato de Alvear, 200 ingenious people from the Qom and Mocav√≠ communities died at the hands of the Chaco police and estancia owners. More the 700 people were injured, including women, children and the elderly. Those who were not killed by police gunfire had their throats‚Äô slit with machetes and axes on behalf of troops from the National Police, sent by Torquato de Alvear.Las masacres del olvido. Napalpi, la genealog√≠a del genocidio y el racismo de Estado en la Argentina. Revista Runa - . = Recent history = In 2006, the primary groups of the Qom were located in the western part of the province of Formosa, the center and eastern sections of the Chaco province and the northern part of the province of Santa Fe, as well as the Chaco Boreal in Paraguay. In Argentina, there are 69,462 registered Qom, with 59,800 members of the tribe who speak the indigenous language. In Paraguay, there are around 700 Qom. In the western region of the province of Formosa, the Qom have mixed with the Pilag√° community and are referred to as the Toba-Pilag√°. There is currently an intense internal migration of the Qom to Gran Rosario. There, the Qom gather especially densely in the neighborhood of Toba and in the northeastern part of the province of Santiago del Estero. Another settlement is found in the jurisdiction of La Plata in the province of Buenos Aires. The Supplementary Survey of Indigenous Communities (Encuesta Complementaria de Pueblos Ind√≠genas) 2004‚Äì2005, complementary to the Argentina's National Census of 2001 recognized 69,452 people living in Argentina as Qom or first generation Qom descended, of which 47,591 lived in the provinces of Chaco, Formosa and Santa Fe, 14,466 lived in the city of Buenos Aires, 24 living in the province of Buenos Aires and 7,395 living in the rest of the country. The National Census of 2010 in Argentina revealed that 126,967 people self-identified as Qom in the country. A breakdown of the survey results showed that 35,544 lived in Gran Buenos Aires, 30,766 in the province of Chaco, 13,475 in the province of Buenos Aires, 12,246 in Formosa, 4,117 in C√≥rdoba, 3,845 in the city of Buenos Aires, 3,427 in the province of Salta, 1,630 in the province of Entre R√≠os, 947 in Santiago del Estero, 928 in Mendoza, 927 in Tucum√°n, 905 in Corrientes, 681 in Chubut, 419 in Catamarca, 221 in Tierra del Fuego, 210 in La Rioja, 209 in Neuqu√©n, 189 in La Pampa and 157 in Santa Cruz. The economic situation for the majority of the Qom is precarious. Many Qom live in areas associated with poverty, or in Argentine slum communities known as villas miserias. Members of the Qom community who maintain their ancestral lands live in rural communities regulated by neighboring commissions, community association or run by traditional leaders, sometimes referred to as caciques. There are some positive indicators such as the fact that 1000 hectares of land were donated to the Qom. This land was used to build houses, supply potable water and establish new bilingual schools were children learn their ancestral history and receive instruction about their culinary traditions. Today, the Qom suffer from a lack of adequate medical care, seen in January 2015 when many Qom died of malnutrition and Tuberculosis. During Roy Nikisch's time as governor, the situation with the Qom in the province of Chaco was declared a \\"true humanitarian emergency\\" by senator Rosa Chiquichano and legislation was passed to confirm the humanitarian situation after dozens of Qom died due to a lack of nutrition. The bishop of Resistencia, the capital of Chaco, arrived to ask for intervention on behalf of the governor when ten indigenous people also died due to a lack of proper nutrition. In 2015, the death of N√©stor Femenia, a seven year old Qom child, gained national attention when the child died of multi-organ failure as a result from complications stemming from malnutrition and tuberculosis. The government has recently built two new hospitals, Laguna Blanca and Hospital El Espinillo, in Qom communities in the province of Formosa. Laguna Blanca is located 15 kilometers from Argentina's border with Paraguay and about 2000 kilometers from the capital of Formosa. The Nam Center for Primary Health Care for Qom, located on National Route 11 in the city of Formosa, was also established in an attempt to provide better healthcare for Qom people. = Land protests = From 2008 to the present, the Qom have participated in a series of protests, in both the province of Formosa as well as the city of Buenos Aires, in order to raise awareness of the discrimination the group has encountered and demand rights to their traditional lands that are guaranteed by the Argentine Constitution.  Roadblock of Route 86  Since 2008, many indigenous people have joined the \\"Movimiento Nacional Campesino Ind√≠gena\\" (National Movement of Indigenous Peasants) and fight for the legal right to their land and against agribusiness. In 2010 this movement became especially powerful when the governor of Formosa, Gildo Insfr√°n, began to push for the construction of the University Institute of Formosa as part of the National University of Formosa, near the Pilcomayo National Forest. However, the La Primavera Qom Community alleges they possess the title to land, which resulted in territorial conflicts when construction began.Cardin, Lorena. En di√°logo con el l√≠der qom F√©lix D√≠az Voces en el F√©nix. Consultado el 19 de febrero de 2015. F√©lix D√≠az, chief of the Qom Felix D√≠az, the chief of the Qom, together with other Qom, decided to cut off the National Route 86 in Argentina in order to protest construction of the University Institute. The Qom claim that the Argentine Constitution establishes that indigenous communities have the right to their ancestral lands, as does the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which acknowledges the relationship between these communities and their lands. Throughout this period, there were incidents of shootings and accusations of aggression towards both the Qom and the police. As a result of the protests, construction of the University Institute was suspended awaiting a decision from the Argentine National Supreme Court of Justice. On November 23, the situation deteriorated when police were called in to forcibly disband the protest. The police burned down temporary shelters built alongside the road and violence erupted, resulting in the arrest of nearly 30 people, including some children. The same day, the Cel√≠a family would also come forward to claim the lands in question, bringing police with them to enforce their claim.Amnist√≠a Internacional (Diciembre de 2012). Transformar dolor en esperanza. Defensores y defensoras de derechos humanos en Am√©rica By the end of the night, two people, a policeman as well as a Qom man named Roberto L√≥pez, had been killed and several others were hospitalized due to the conflict.Los qom, reclamos y di√°logo P√°gina 12. Consultado el 3 de marzo de 2015. D√≠az and other Qom protestors were even shot at by both the police and supporters of the Cel√≠a family. As a result of the violent events that occurred on November 23, D√≠az, as well as 23 other members of the Qom community, were accused of crimes of illegal occupation and usurpation of land and became involved in criminal proceedings against them. In order to further protests and raise awareness of these inceidents, D√≠az and other Qom moved their protest to the city of Buenos Aires. However, no public or governmental entity received the Qom other than Florencio Randazzo, an Argentine politician who worked as the Minister of the Interior from 2007 to 2015. D√≠az was also received by Pope Francis who was concerned over the severity of the incidents. Despite this, threats towards the Qom community did not stop.Luis Gasulla. El negocio de la impunidad: La herencia K The Supreme Court planned a public forum for March 7, 2012, in which all parties involved could come and express their positions. Members of the provincial government, officials from the Institute for Indigenous Affairs, CELS (the Center for Legal and Social Studies), and Felix D√≠az, who served as a representative of the Qom community, were all invited. Stella Maris Zabala de Copes, the district attorney for the province of Formosa would attend the forum in place of the governor of Formosa. The two primary issues discussed during the forum were the controversy over land rights and the increasing acts of violence towards indigenous members.La lucha de los qom lleg√≥ a la Corte Plaza de Mayo. In August 2012, concern for violence towards indigenous members was especially apparent after D√≠az was run over by a truck while traveling on his motorcycle. According to witnesses, the vehicle that ran over D√≠az was owned by the same Cel√≠a family that had also claimed land in Formosa. Defense attorneys for D√≠az and CELS argued that the district attorney's office refused to listen to evidence presented by D√≠az and instead only listened to testimonies brought forward by the police. In April 2012, the charges against D√≠az and the other 23 Qom members were dismissed due to a lack of evidence. In November, the Chamber of Appeals for Resistance withdrew charges against D√≠az and Amanda Asikak. The judges stated that the roadbloack of the National Route 86 was the only measure the indigenous group had at their disposition in order to protest the construction of the National Institute.Amnist√≠a Internacional. Informe 2013 Amnist√≠a Internacional. El Estado de los Derechos Humanos en el Mundo However, the Penal Council ordered that the investigation continue into D√≠az's supposed violent acts that occurred November 23. Despite orders to continue investigating the events of November 23, the court has never investigated the attacks perpetrated against D√≠az and his community. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked Argentine authorities to take measures in order to guarantee security and safety for F√©lix D√≠az and his family. Due to the increased police presence, other threats against the community were observed. In 2012, while D√≠az travelled along the intersection of Route 2 and Route 86, he was hit by an all-terrain vehicle (known commonly as a 4x4). The vehicle then fled the scene. The vehicle that caused the accident was recognized by inhabitants of the area as that of the Cel√≠a family, who besides being close friends to government officials in Formosa, had already been accused of a previous attack against D√≠az during the roadblock of the Route 86. After the incident gained public attention, D√≠az was moved to an intensive therapy program and would publicly claim that the incident was an attack against his life and a direct result of the Qom's land dispute. Over the next year, several Qom would be killed in car accidents along the Route 86, a result of what many indigenous members claimed to be homicide. In January 2013, Juan Daniel Asijak, the 16-year-old nephew of D√≠az, died in an accident on Route 86. He had been hit with a piece of oxidized iron that did not seem to be a result of the accident and could not be explained as belonging to the car or any nearby structures.Denuncian que otro joven qom fue asesinado con un golpe en la cabeza Perfil. The same month, Imer Ilbercio Flores, a young Qom child, was killed in a car accident in Villa R√≠o Bermejito, in the province of Chaco. A month before, a similar accident had occurred when a truck charged a motorcycle driven by a Qom woman named Celestina Jara, resulting in her death and that of her granddaughter Lila Coyip√©.Qom: un muerto m√°s Plaza de Mayo.  Qopiwini and Buenos Aires Protests  By the end of February, 2015, the Qom, Pilag√°, Wichi and Nivacl√© communities (grouped together under the Qopiwini organization) established a camp at the intersection of the Avenida 9 de Julio and Avenida de Mayo in the city of Buenos Aires. Here, they hoped to denounce the actions taken by the government of Formosa and obtain more signatures of those who supported their land claim.¬´F√©lix D√≠az vuelve a acampar en la 9 de Julio ¬ª Notas Periodismo Popular. Consultado el 28 de febrero de 2015. D√≠az also claimed that the government had not cooperated with any of the previously established treaties during the past four years that would protect the different communities. Amnesty International asked the Argentine government protect and ensure the physical safety of the communities. The camp gained international attention, including that of The Guardian and other famous news groups.Argentina indigenous chieftain leads fight to reclaim ancestral land The Guardian. In April, the camp suffered an attack when a person on board a motorcycle threw a Molotov cocktail into one of the camp tents and at nearly the same time, various unidentified people in the state of Formosa broke into the Qom Radio Station, FM 89.3, and destroyed much of the equipment.Ataques a la comunidad qom en Formosa y Buenos Aires Notas.org On July 1, 2015, more than one hundred members of the Federal Police surrounded the campsite. D√≠az met with one of the deputies and was presented with an order of eviction. In September, Gustavo Cordera, a famous Argentine musician, visited the campsite and expressed public support for the Qom cause.Cordera visito el acampe qom y se sumo al reclamo TN.com.ar Additionally, Cordera and D√≠az made an appearance on the TV show Intratables, a program that analyzes the most important and controversial news stories.Cordera dej√≥ mudo a los panelistas de Intratables Truncadonoticias. On November 3, 2015, Mauricio Macri, at the time a presidential candidate for the Cambiemos political coalition, visited the campsite and interviewed D√≠az. Marco signed an act of compromise, promising to comply with several of the indigenous communities‚Äô demands should he win the ballotage on November 22.Mauricio Macri se reuni√≥ con F√©lix D√≠az en el acampe Qom de la 9 de Julio Diario La Naci√≥n. According to D√≠az, Macri never asked for votes or support in exchange for his cooperation.F√©lix D√≠az: \\"Macri no nos pidi√≥ votos, ni apoyar su candidatura\\" Diario La Naci√≥n. Instead, Macri signed the act in order to promote indigenous rights. D√≠az publicly asked Daniel Scioli, the other presidential candidate, to visit the campsite and meet with leaders but this ultimately never happened.  Qom Protests under Macri Administration  With the knowledge that Mauricio Macri had won the presidency, the Qom and other indigenous groups from the Qopiwini were able to have an interview with Claudio Avruj, the secretary for Human Rights, who confirmed that the new government would issue a response to the indigenous groups‚Äô claims. Following this interview on Tuesday, December 1, the Qopiwini announced in a press conference that they would be clearing the campsite on December 6. One of the reasons given for the abandonment of the campsite was the fear of further attacks on the campsite by supporters of former president Cristina Fern√°ndez Kirchner on December 10, the day of Macri's inauguration, given that attacks had already been perpetrated by pro-Kirchner supporters.Desmantelaron la carpa de los qom tras un acuerdo con Macri Diario La Naci√≥n. F√©lix D√≠az meets with Argentina President, Mauricio Macri. On December 17, a week after officially being recognized as the President of Argentina, Macri held talks with D√≠az and other indigenous leaders such as Relmu √ëamku.Mauricio Macri: \\"Vamos a trabajar juntos para atender las necesidades de los pueblos originarios\\" Diario La Naci√≥n. In February 2016, it was rumored that D√≠az could be chosen to serve as president of the National Institute of Indigenous Affairs (INAI). This rumor was confirmed by Relmu √ëamku, one of those present during initial talks between D√≠az and Macri.Relmu √ëamku: ‚ÄúHasta ahora la figura de consenso para el INAI es F√©lix D√≠az‚Äù Kaos en la red. However, Ra√∫l Eduardo Rudiaz was assigned as president of the institute instead. In an interview, D√≠az confirmed that one of the points of the agreement that had been signed by Macri was that the INAI be presided over by an indigenous person. Despite the seeming lack of progress, D√≠az continued to express hope that Macri would abide by the compromise act he had signed. D√≠az, together with other indigenous communities, returned to Buenos Aires on March 15, 2016 to rebuild the camp and raise awareness of the struggles of indigenous communities once again.¬´F√âLIX D√çAZ VOLVI√ì A ACAMPAR POR LOS DERECHOS DE LOS QOM ¬ª El Federal. However, this time, the indigenous communities decided to set up camp in the former Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics, a controversial site that had once been used as a clandestine detention center for the disappearance and torture of political prisoners during the Argentine military dictatorship, and known popularly as the ex-ESMA. The Qom and other communities hoped that by protesting in this historically important site, they would gain more attention and ultimately be received by the Secretary of Human Rights, Claudio Avruj. At the end of March, the Department of Human Rights proposed the creation of a process of Consultative and Participative Advice of Indigenous Peoples (Consejo Consultivo y Participativo de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas) which had been formed and supported by various indigenous leaders. Claudio Avruj, the secretary of Human Rights, affirmed that the agreement had been the result of meetings of the Council of Work and Dialogue between Indigenous Peoples and the National Government. Avruj also stated that D√≠az promised to dismantle the campsite at the ex-ESMA provided that the government continued to consult indigenous communities and move forward with Macri's previously signed compromise. On July 15, 2016, the Consultative and Participative Advice of Indigenous Peoples program was officially created. During the next two days, nearly 300 indigenous community members and leaders attended meetings and debates in order to establish internal rules and design an executive commission within the program. Relmu √ëamku was designated Secretary General while F√©lix D√≠az was chosen as president of the organization. Besides these two leaders, four vice-presidents were selected in order to represent the four historic regions of Argentina: Faustino Lencina in Central Argentina, Jorge Palomo in Northeast Argentina, Margarita Mamani and Rolando Flores in Northwest Argentina and Rub√©n Huanque in Southern Argentina.  Culture Language= The language of the Qom is referred to as qom l‚Äôaqtac and from a linguistic point of view, it is assumed to belong to the Guaicuruan language group that many authors consider that, along with the Matacoana languages that form the mataco-guaicuruan linguistic family. In the Toba Qom language, the Qom originally referred to themselves as the ntok√≥it, but since the end of the 20th century, this indigenous group began to utilize the self-given name, Qom, that is derived from the personal pronoun qomi, meaning we.UNA REVISI√ìN DE LOS ETN√ìNIMOS DE LOS TOBA (QOM) DEL CHACO ARGENTINO EN FUNCI√ìN DE LA CATEGOR√çA DE \\"PERSONA\\" Y DE LA \\"VIDA SOCIAL\\"1. Por Dra. Florencia Tola In a restricted sense, this name refers only to the Qom people and in a more ample context, it can refer to all indigenous groups. Also, although less frequently, the Qom refer to themselves as the qom‚Äôlek or qom‚Äôlik. Despite being an indigenous group from the Pampas region and not from the Andean region, since the 1980s, it is common to see the word written as qom where the \\"q\\" denotes a voiceless uvular stop that appears in Andean languages such as Quechua and Aimara and sounds similar to a \\"k\\".Los sonidos de la lengua (fonolog√≠a), texto de Cristina Messineo que forma parte de los materiales de trabajo del Taller de Lengua y Cultura Toba. Inicio de la segunda p√°gina: la postvelar oclusiva sorda \\"q\\" que se articula con el posdorso de la lengua sobre la √∫vula: qoto (/kjoto/, que significa ‚Äòpaloma‚Äô), qolleguesaq (/kjolegues√°kj/, que significa ‚Äòiguana‚Äô), pero kom (‚Äòtoba‚Äô). As it commonly occurs in the spelling of indigenous names, there are many variations in spelling for indigenous words. \\"Toba\\" is an initially pejorative name of Guarani origin, but it is of ample use among the Qom themselves, in the self-naming of their communities and in the national census of Argentina. The name tov√° (forehead) came to be as a result of the idea that the Qom, according to some sources, used to shave the hair off of the front part of their scalps. Other sources attribute it to a custom, not currently practiced, of removing the hair from one's eyebrows.Balmori, C. (1957). Notas de un viaje a los toba. Revista de la Universidad, 2, pp. 23-36. For these motives, the Spanish from Asuncion, called them frentones (meaning large forehead, a name also given to the Abip√≥n people and the Guaicurues) following the first encounter between the two groups in the 16th century. The generalization of the toba name did not occur among the Qom themselves until the beginning of the 18th century. In Paraguay, this group also used to call themselves the emok, a term in the Enlhet language that means friend or countrymen.Edgardo Civallero: ¬´Glosario de lenguas ind√≠genas sudamericanas¬ª. C√≥rdoba (Argentina): Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba, sin fecha. As of 2007, there were an estimated 40,000 people who spoke Toba Qom as native speakers. In 2010, the province of Chaco in Argentina recognized Toba Qom as one of the official languages of the province in addition to Spanish, Wichi and Moqoit. = Religion = The Qom's system of beliefs have been classified as animistic and shamanistic. The Qom worship all natural beings and possess a belief in a supreme being. The Qom maintain this religious system through oral traditions and transmission of their beliefs. Traditionally, the Qom built tamnaGaik√≠ that served as prayer huts where all members of Qom society were welcome to gather and pray together. In any case, even today, a large part of the Qom population turn to shamans or pio‚Äôoxonak which act as healers. Traditional medicine practiced by healers and shamans places a special emphasis on the use of animals ‚Äî and especially animal fat ‚Äî in the form of zootherapy. Studies show that Qom shamans have nearly 200 medicinal uses for almost 75 different species of animals, including birds, insects, reptiles and mollusks. While most of the animals used for medicinal purposes are native to the Chaco region, Qom shamans have also incorporated the medicinal use non-native species such as horses and bees. One possible explanation for the Qom's reverence of the use of animals in their medicine is seen through their animistic religious beliefs where animals were believed to have been gods and the original creators of the lands.Mart√≠nez, G. (2013). Use of fauna in the traditional medicine of native Toba (qom) from the Argentine Gran Chaco region: An ethnozoological and conservationist approach. Ethnobiology and Conservation, Ethnobiology and Conservation, 03/20/2013. In addition to their important role as spiritual leaders and healers, Qom shaman also serve as political leaders and as counselors to a band's chief. During colonization, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries viewed the Qom's religious beliefs as being inspired by the Devil, claiming that shamans, in particular, were weapons of Satan that prevented the successful evangelization of the Qom. Before the acceptation of Christianity, infanticide was frequent among the Qom, a custom that was a result of the scarcity of food and other resources that the Qom historically suffered. In return, the children who survived were treated with special dedication and affection. Today, most Qom have adopted Christianity. While the Qom practice a variety of different sects of Christianity, Anglican and Pentecostal groups are especially prevalent given that many shamans converted to Protestant priests. Unfortunately, inequalities among the Qom do exist as a result of religious beliefs, especially between Anglicans and those who maintain traditional beliefs and practices. Here, many Anglican practitioners look down upon traditional religious practices and beliefs as well as ancient Qom society as a whole, believing that it represents a period in which the Qom were not civilized or developed people. = Traditional clothing = A collage of images showing Qom people in their traditional clothing. Qom culture, with respect to their customs and traditions, is very efficient and functional in design. The Qom lived in log shelters covered in straw with living spaces that measured some two meters in diameter. The Qom made ceramic objects, wove baskets and knit clothes for mostly utilitarian purposes. During the warmest months, the Qom used almost no clothing, with the exception of simple loincloths. In the cooler months, the Qom used more complex clothing and on occasions such as ritual celebrations, the Qom adorned themselves elaborately. Here, they wore dresses called potos prepared with fibers from the Achmea distichantha plant also known as the Brazilian vaseplant, as well as leather and cotton, following the arrival of the Spanish. During the coldest months of the year, the Qom wrapped themselves in ponchos. Adult males adorned their heads with the opaga, a headdress made from feathers and cords made from the vase plant. Women and younger men decorated themselves with onguaghachik: bracelets originally made using teeth and claws from animals, seeds, feathers, shells and cochleas. It appears that the Qom obtained many of these elements through a system of barter and trade with other indigenous groups. Necklaces called colaq were also worn and made using similar items to the onguaghachik. Another item, known as the nallaghachik were eminently festive accessories that were brightly colored and made using feathers, flowers and leaves. = Gender roles = While there is a strict division of labor among the Qom, men and women are considered equally important and respected in social and political terms. Traditionally, a man's primary job within the tribe was to hunt while women primarily worked as gatherers and maintained small plots of vegetables. Both jobs were considered equally important among the Qom and there was no discrimination between genders. The only role in society that did not have an equivalent role for the opposite gender was that of the warrior. For the Qom, only men were permitted to actively participate in raids and battles as warriors although women were frequently involved in the aftermath. Even before the raids, women were not allowed to participate in rituals such as the Dance of Courage, in order to ensure that the warriors were focused and ready for war. Following the event, women often divided the winnings of the battle or raid, splitting up the resources received and finding families to raise children from foreign tribes that were taken prisoner. In the aftermath of victory, the Qom would participate in the Dance of the Scalps in which everyone celebrated, indulging in fermented, alcoholic beverages. However, as part of their duties, women did not drink and had to remain sober in order to prevent and de-escalate any quarrels that might result and act as mediators. Another difference in gender roles among the Qom appears in the way in which men and women display aggression. Traditionally, men would not engage in physical violence using their fists or weapons to hurt one another but rather would fight through a series of challenges to determine who was stronger. In the case that physical fighting did break out, other men would not interfere. In fact, only the intervention of a woman, particularly one with close ties to one of the men involved, could end the fight. However, for women, fights were often public and there was never any form of intervention. These fights were seen as spectacles and were often observed by various members of the group until one woman ceded or was sufficiently wounded. Additionally, women's fights differ from men's in the use of weapons. Traditionally, it was not uncommon for Qom women to use knuckle-dusters. These weapons were made from wood or pieces of hide and sharp objects such as piranha teeth or sharpened rocks could be added in order to cause more damage to one's opponent. Even among children, this difference between physical aggression between girls and boys has been observed in which young girls seem more aggressive and engage in physical fights more often than boys. Today, gender roles among the Qom have changed. In more rural areas, women are becoming increasingly involved in maintaining sheep and goat herds as well as in craftsmanship, weaving complex tapestries and handbags. While men are still involved in hunting and farming, the emergence of jobs in state agencies such as a municipality or other public sector jobs have resulted in a large change in Qom society. Increasingly, men are being seen as the primary income recipient in the household, resulting in increasingly unequal gender roles for the Qom. On a larger scale, this development has led to the development of a social hierarchy among the Qom where there was previously none, resulting in social inequalities and unrest among some Qom communities. = Nutrition and agriculture = Until the 19th century, the Qom were primarily a hunter-gatherer, semi-nomadic society that traveled in pursuit of dietary resources. There also existed a very strict sexual division of labor: the men, from a very early age, dedicated themselves to hunting and fishing and the women collected food and worked in incipient agricultural gardens that were in large part influenced by contributions from the groups from the Andean and Amazonian regions. In this way, the Qom women cultivated plants such as nachitek (squash), olta√±i (corn), avagha (beans), sweet potatoes and manioc on small and medium-sized plots. However, these products were only complementary to their diet and the Qom never produced a surplus of such items. One possible explanation for this is that between the months of August and September, the Qom went through what was known as the Hungry Season and the period of silence. This time, the end of winter and the beginning of spring, represents a period in weather in which it is hard to successfully support and produce agriculture and wildlife is often not as active as it might be due to periods of cold weather. During this time, Qom women would often gather what they considered to be emergency foods: such as prickly pears, tubers and reeds. Another ecological explanation for this apparent flaw is that the climate and soil of their territory did not have a high enough yield for agricultural production while the Chaco territory, in its natural state, was a great source for supplying the Qom's dietary needs, especially with respect to proteins. The Qom hunted principally tapirs, peccaries, deer, guanaco and a large variety of birds. Additionally, the Qom used to collect honey and large amounts of fruit and berries. Members of the Qom community in the early 1960s use an ox to plow the fields of their farm. During the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the Qom farmed small and medium-sized plots or worked as temporary laborers at rural jobs, such as being an axeman or a cotton picker. As incipient cultivators, their agriculture is primarily subsistence in nature where the cultivation of squash, manioc and sweet potatoes was most common. Another way in which the Qom obtained resources is the diversification of artisanal interests such as ceramics, Guaiacum products, and textiles. However, in the second half of the 20th century, many Qom were forced to migrate to the city, especially cities such as Roque S√°enz Pe√±a, Resistencia, Gran Santa Fe, Gran Rosario and Gran Buenos Aires, due to the destruction of their agricultural lands and the introduction of the soybean plant. In such urban nuclei, almost all Qom in their entirety live in poorer economic zones. One group on investigators from the Department of Agriculture in the University of Buenos Aires, together with members of the Qom community \\"La Primavera\\" are working to reintroduce some sixty indigenous types of corn that are not reproducing as they should. According to Juli√°n Hern√°ndez, \\"The objective is to reintroduce native corn varieties adapted to the environmental conditions of the northeast Argentina and the Chaco region, to support the availability of food and to better the economic earnings of an indigenous group in the region\\". Hern√°ndez has studied these varieties of corn for more than thirty-five years and will be the director of a joint initiative to lead a team of agriculturalists, anthropologists and biologists from the University of Buenos Aires.Ma√≠z argentino para los Qom Diario Clar√≠n. Consultado el 10 de noviembre de 2015.  Presence in culture  Gustavo Cordera and F√©lix D√≠az meet at the protest camp in Buenos Aires. Many Argentine authors and composers portray the Qom community as one of the themes of their works. One of such works is \\"Antiguo due√±o de las flechas\\" (\\"The Ancient Owner of the Arrows\\"), a song more frequently recognized by its opening line: \\"Indio toba\\".Ficha de la canci√≥n Indio toba en el sitio web de Sada√≠c. The lyrics to \\"Antiguo due√±o de las flechas\\" were written by historian and poet F√©lix Luna while the melody was composed by a pianist and composer from Santa Fe by the name of Ariel Ram√≠rez. The song was registered by SADA√çC (The Argentine Society of Authors and Composers) in 1974 and the most popular version of the song was performed by Mercedes Sosa. The duo Tonolec, a group composed of Qom singers and musicians, interpreted the song in the Qom's own language and mixed the released the new version with electronic rhythms. The chief of the Qom, F√©lix D√≠az, sang the song together with Gustavo Cordera at the Qom camp. The general history of the Qom community and other Guaicurue ethnic group was captured in the work Historia sagrada del pueblo qom en el pa√≠s chaque√±o (The Sacred History of the Qom Community in the Country of Chaco) by the Argentine Flavio Dalastto, who has published volumes one and two of a collection of five. The most famous Qom figure from the collection is the singer Charo Bogarin Tonolec. In 2008, Jorge Luis Nu√±ez and Gustavo Giorgetti directed a short documentary called Tierras prometidas: El periplo de los aborigenes Tobas (Promised Land: The Journey of the Toba Aboriginals). While the documentary begins with interactions between the Qom people and Spanish missionaries and discusses the various struggles the Qom have historically faced until the present day, the vast majority of Tierras prometidas focuses on the April 19th Qom Community that lives in Buenos Aires, in the neighborhood of Dock Sud. As one of the largest petrochemical hubs in Buenos Aires, Dock Sud is regarded as one of the most polluted areas in Buenos Aires, where heavy metals and chemical contamination are prevalent and endanger the lives of those living around the contaminated river. Chief Ruben Sarmiento describes the struggles the Qom people face living in this community, including poverty, discrimination, malnutrition, crime, Tuberculosis and Chagas disease.  Flags  The Qom flag The second Qom flag The Qom use three different flags in order to represent themselves and their culture. One flag, pictured to the right, shows yellow, green and red vertical stripes in a repeating pattern Here, the colors of the Qom flag represent the seasons in the Chaco region where the Qom traditionally live: yellow represents the flowers in the springtime, green represents all the trees in the summer and rusty-red color represents the ripe fruit of the fall. The repetition of the colors signifies the cycle of the seasons and the continuation of the Qom way of life. A second Qom flag shares similar color symbolism to the first. However, there are two major differences between the flags: their pattern and the use of blue horizontal stripes in the second flag. While there does not appear to be great significance with respect to the change in pattern between the two flags, the blue, horizontal stripes of the second flag represent water and its impact on life and the earth. The final flag used by the Qom is the Wiphala, a flag used by many indigenous communities in South America. The Qom, and other indigenous groups in Argentina, use the Qullasuyu version of the flag where the longest diagonal stripe of the flag is made using white squares. The Qom's use of this flag became especially popular during more recent land protests when various indigenous groups protested jointly in an attempt to regain their ancestral lands.  Communities  Argentina = Since 1995, the National Institute of Indigenous Issues (INAI) began to recognize legal capacity through the means of registration with the National Register of Indigenous Communities (RENACI) to indigenous communities in Argentina.

Conflicts between the Qom and the Spanish were common. In the early 1840s, the Qom revolted against Spanish soldiers led by General Manuel Rodr√≠guez Magari√±os after their attempts to build forts and reduce Toba territory. In 1880, the Mission of San Francisco was founded in Villa Montes with the goal of civilizing the Toba, Mataco (a Wichi tribe) and Chiriguanos. In 1882, the Toba were in conflict with the colonies of Caiza. On April 27, 1882, a group of Toba killed a French explorer by the name of Jules Crevaux who worked on behalf of the Bolivian government. Throughout the entirety of the 1880s, the Bolivian government sponsored and financially supported groups of colonists in the Chaco region to kill members of the Qom and other indigenous groups. After continued confrontations, many Toba immigrated to Paraguayan territory. In 1912, a massacre of Toba people by military troops led by Colonel Ponce occurred in San Francisco. The Qom who survived fled to Argentina.Estrategias de sobrevivencia entre los tapietes del Gran Chaco, p√°g 37-39. Autor: Eddy Arce Birbueth.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the sixth written by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was Illustrated by John R. Neill. Plot summary Thompson begins with a usurping tyrant, Irasha the Rough, the Pasha of Rash, a tiny kingdom in the southwest of Ev. The Pasha has a problem: his prison is too full to cram any more Rashers in. His Vizier's solution is to obtain a ferocious animal from nearby Oz to devour the luckless prisoners. Travelling to the Emerald City by his magical \\"hurry cane\\", the Vizier lures the Hungry Tiger (first seen in Ozma of Oz) to Rash. As might be expected from his history, however, the Hungry Tiger is too tenderhearted to eat prisoners. Meanwhile, through an unfortunate series of events involving a winding road and a pair of Quick Sandals, Betsy Bobbin (introduced in Tik-Tok of Oz) and her new acquaintance, Carter Green, the Vegetable Man, end up in Rash, and no sooner do they arrive than they're thrown into the crowded prison. There they meet the Scarlet Prince Evered (known as Reddy), the rightful ruler of Rash. Together with the Tiger, they escape, and have varied adventures with Big Wigs and Gnomes in their search for three magic rubies. Back in Oz, Princess Ozma has troubles of her own: she is confronted by Atmos Fere, a balloon-like being who lives in the upper stratosphere. His plan is to kidnap her up to his own kingdom, to prove to his skeptical fellows that living beings can exist on the surface of the Earth. Ozma, however, has a secret weapon (a pin). In time, the adventurers recover the magic rubies, and Reddy is restored to the Rashian throne. The Pasha and his evil Vizier end up stranded on a desert island in the Nonestic Ocean. Promotion Publisher Reilly & Lee mounted an imaginative promotional campaign for the book. The company returned to the tactic of issuing press releases in the form of the Ozmapolitan, the supposed newspaper of the Emerald City. They also formed a fan-club for children called the Ozmite Club -- though it lasted for only two years.David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 72.

It is a purpose-built complex for events and exhibitions. The building is featured on the 100 dirham bank note. The building is the first tallest building to be on record in the history of the United Arab Emirates from the period of 1979 to 1999. With over 1.3 million square feet of covered exhibition and event space, comprising 21 halls and over 40 meeting rooms across 3 floors, Dubai World Trade Centre hosts over 500 events annually. In 2015, the venue held 396 trade events and welcomed over 2.74 million visitors.  History  Built in 1979, designed by John R Harris and Partners (JRHP), the Sheikh Rashid Tower, as it was known back then, was amongst the earliest skyscrapers to be constructed in Dubai. Renamed after the late Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the 39-story Sheikh Rashid Tower no longer stands alone as it did when it was first built. Over the years, the Dubai World Trade Centre has been extended to include Exhibition Halls, Sheikh Rashid Hall and Maktoum Hall as well as the Al Mulaqua Ballroom, Sheikh Saeed Halls, Za‚Äôabeel Halls and the Trade Centre Arena. In addition, commercial buildings have been added including the Convention Tower and the One Central development with several mixed-use buildings. In April 2020, in efforts to counter the COVID-19 pandemic, the DWTC was converted into a field hospital with a capacity to treat up to 3,000 COVID-19 patients.

Sand was part of the League for Spiritual Discovery at the Millbrook estate in New York, has been credited as the \\"first underground chemist on record to have synthesized DMT\\" and is known for manufacturing large amounts of LSD.Wilcock, David. The Source Field Investigations Penguin Group. 2011.Lee, Martin A. Shlain, Bruce. Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of Lsd. Grove Press. 2007 Early life Sand was born in Brooklyn, New York City on May 10, 1941. His father Clarence Hiskey, was a researcher in the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory who attempted to spy for the Soviet Union. After his parents divorced, Sand took his mother's maiden name. Sand graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1959 and then spent a year working on a kibbutz in Israel. He graduated from Brooklyn College with a degree in anthropology and sociology in 1966. Career Sand became interested in the teachings of George Gurdjieff, the study of different cultures, and various Eastern philosophers.Lee, Martin A. Shlain, Bruce. Acid Dreams: The Complete Social History of Lsd. Grove Press. 2007 In 1961, he had his first mescaline experience. Shortly after graduating from college, Sand followed Leary and Alpert to Millbrook. During this time Sand also began synthesizing DMT in his bathtub, and he is credited with being the first to discover that it was active when volatized (smoked).http://www.dmtsite.com/dmt/information/history_discovery.html Sand later started a perfume company as a front for the production of mescaline and DMT.The Brotherhood of Eternal Love Drug Library.net Sand and David L. Mantell were arrested on April 1, 1967 when their truck failed to stop at the Dinosaur, Colorado Port of Entry. The truck was eventually searched and federal agents reportedly found 313,000 doses of LSD and a laboratory-on- wheels. In 1967 Sand was introduced to fellow chemist Tim Scully, who trained under Owsley Stanley until Stanley's legal troubles in December 1967. In December 1968 Sand purchased a secluded farmhouse in Windsor, California, at that time a small town in rural Sonoma County. There he and Scully set up a large LSD lab. Here they produced over 3.6 million tablets of LSD that was distributed under the name \\"orange sunshine\\". 1972 indictments  A joint state, federal and local strike force called \\"Operation BEL\\" was assembled in early 1972. On August 3, 1972 the Orange County, California Grand Jury returned an indictment against 29 alleged members of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, including Sand; the indictment was primarily aimed at the hashish smuggling arm of the Brotherhood. The investigation continued and on December 6, 1972 the Orange County, California Grand Jury returned another indictment, this time aimed primarily against the Brotherhood of Eternal Love's \\"orange sunshine\\" LSD system; Sand was included in that indictment too. 1973 arrest and prosecution  On January 19, 1973 \\"Leland H. Jordan\\" (later identified as Sand) and Judy Neal Shaughnessy were arrested on drug charges by Kirkwood, Missouri, police, shortly after they arrived from San Francisco. Their residence at 425 North Highway 21 in Fenton, Missouri, an elaborate hilltop home on 18 acres of land, had been found to contain hundreds of gallons of chemicals and elaborate laboratory equipment. On April 25, 1973, Sand, Tim Scully, Michael Randall, and four other major figures in the LSD operation were indicted by a Federal grand jury in San Francisco. On January 30, 1974 Sand and Scully were found guilty, partially due to the testimony of Billy Hitchcock and other informants. On March 8, 1974 Sand was sentenced to 15 years in a federal penitentiary. The defense presented at his trial claimed that the defendants had made ALD-52 instead of LSD-25. Sand's attorney appealed his conviction, based on four technical legal issues: pre-indictment delay, refusal to suppress bank records, lack of a taint hearing and use of Swiss bank records. The appeal was denied by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on September 13, 1976 and rehearing was denied October 8, 1976. LSD chemist William Leonard Pickard contributed to Sand's legal defense fund. Sand fled to Canada in 1976, evading imprisonment. LSD historian Mark McCloud reports that Sand then traveled to the ashram of so-called \\"sex guru\\" Rajneesh in west India. Sand eventually returned to North America, again producing large quantities of LSD. Sand was arrested for drug manufacturing in 1990 in British Columbia, but as he was living under an alias, police did not determine his identity and Sand fled while on bail. 1996 arrest Sand was arrested again in 1996 in Canada. Refusing to cooperate with the police, it took forensic investigators two months to determine Sand's real identity. Police found 43 grams of crystalline LSD at Sand's lab, approximately 430,000 doses of LSD. The bust also uncovered large quantities of DMT, 2C-B, MDMA, and $500,000 worth of cash and gold. Death Sand died of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Lagunitas, California on April 24, 2017 at the age of 75.

It is the more northeastern of two automobile canal crossings, the other being the Bourne Bridge. Most traffic approaching from the north follows Massachusetts Route 3 which ends at Route 6 just north of the bridge, and the bridge provides direct expressway connections from Boston and Interstate 93. There is a six-foot wide sidewalk for pedestrian and bicycle access on the east side of the bridge. The sidewalk is slightly raised, but there is no fence or barrier between it and car traffic, so cyclists are recommended to walk their bicycle. The bridge road is plowed in winter, although the sidewalk is sometimes unplowed and unpassable. The bridges to the Cape are sometimes closed for safety during high winds.Bourne, Sagamore bridges may close if Hurricane Sandy brings sustained winds of 70 mph History The bridge and its sibling the Bourne Bridge were constructed beginning in 1933 by the Public Works Administration for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which operates both the bridges and the canal. Both bridges carry four lanes of traffic over a main span, with a ship clearance. They opened to traffic on June 22, 1935. The design of the Sagamore and Bourne bridges was later copied in miniature for the John Greenleaf Whittier Bridge that connects I-95 from Newburyport to Amesbury, Massachusetts. The bridges replaced a drawbridge which was built before the canal was widened. The original bridge approaches are still visible to the north of the modern bridge, though both approaches are in low-traffic residential areas. In 2004, construction began to replace the rotary that connects Route 6 and Route 3 to the bridge with a trumpet interchange known as the \\"Sagamore Flyover\\". This project had been delayed for many years because of a controversy about the disruption of homes and businesses in the area. The project finally commenced because of the severe gridlock at the rotary, which was built to accommodate a much smaller amount of traffic. The flyover was completed in late 2006. The Army Corps of Engineers replaced the bridge deck, the sidewalk, and the lighting in May 2010. In October 2019, the Corps recommended replacing the bridge with a wider bridge with six travel lanes, bike and pedestrian paths, shoulders, and a median. The recommendation said that replacement was more cost-effective than upgrading the existing bridge in order to reduce long summertime backups.

Austin Freeman (1862‚Äì1943). Thorndyke was described by his author as a 'medical jurispractitioner': originally a medical doctor, he turned to the bar and became one of the first ‚Äî in modern parlance ‚Äî forensic scientists. His solutions were based on his method of collecting all possible data (including dust and pond weed) and making inferences from them before looking at any of the protagonists and motives in the crimes. Freeman ensured that his methods were practical by conducting all experiments mentioned in the stories himself. Attributes John Evelyn Thorndyke was born on 4 July 1870. He received his medical education at St Margaret's Hospital, where he got his primary degree. Instead of the leaving the hospital however, he remained there, taking up any small appointments that were goingassistant demonstratoror curatorships and such like. He hung around the chemical and physical laboratories, the museum and port mortem room and meanwhile qualified as an M. D. and a D. Sc. Then he got called to the Bar with an eye to getting an appointment as coroner, but the lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at St. Margarets retired unexpectedly, and Thorndyke applied for the vacant post. He was appointed to the post and then set himself up in chambers. His first case was when he appeared for the defence in Regina v. Gummer. Thorndyke resided at 5A King's Bench Walk, Inner Temple.In Meet Dr. Thorndyke, Freeman gives his address as 4 King's Bench Walk. In The Red Thumb Mark he directs Jervis to his rooms at 6A King's Bench Walk. In 5A King's Bench Walk Stone notes that apart from these lapses, the other books and stories give the address as 5a. Thorndyke's office and reception room were on the first floor (i.e. the first floor above the ground floor), with the workshop and laboratory on the second floor, and the bedrooms in the attic floor. He was often assisted by his friend and foil Christopher Jervis, who usually acts as narrator, and always by the resourceful Nathaniel Polton, his crinkly-faced lab technician. Thorndyke had rescued Polton from poverty, after he had been hospitalised for starvation. Polton helped Thorndyke set up the laboratory after he took the rooms at King's Bench Walk. Thorndyke tended to have a better relationship with the police (usually in the form of Superintendent Miller) than Sherlock Holmes did, despite proving them wrong on numerous occasions. Thorndyke, although tall, athletic, handsome, and clever, never married. Freeman wrote that Dr. Thorndyke was not based on any person, real or fictitious. He was deliberately invented. In a professional sense he may have been suggested to me by Dr. Alfred Swayne Taylor . . . but his personality was designed in accordance with certain principles and what I believed to be the probabilities as to what such a man would be like. Freeman put a great deal of effort into ensuring the accuracy of the Thorndyke stories, including carrying out the described experiments himself and visiting the locations described in the stories. Freeman had his own lab and workshop on the top floor of his house at Gravesend where he tested the methods used by Thorndyke. One example of his approach is in The Red Thumb Mark. The story revolves in part around the Thumbograph (actually called the Thumb o'Graphs as in authographs). This was launched on the market in 1904 by the stationer and publisher Dow & Lester. It consisted of a book of blank pages, with a single page of instructions, and an ink pad attached to one of the covers. Thorndyke noted on the fly-lead of his own copy of the Red Thumb Mark that the Thumbograph was available at all the railway book-stalls, and that he either bought one or got one as a gift. However, he considered it an dangerous invention, as his observations in the Finger-print Department, led him to think it possible to make false fingerprints from a copy of a fingerprint. He experimented with his own fingerprints and made a stamps that could reproduce them. Thus he tested the method that the villain uses in the book, and that Thorndyke uses to convince the court, before he wrote about it. Such is the accuracy of Freeman's writing that P. R. Gordon wrote to The Queenslander in 1913 to suggest that they should publish the description of the life history of the liver fluke that Freeman gives in The Eye of Orisis as it was so well and tersely told that it would be read with great interest by sheep owners and others.\\" Leadbeatter describes Thorndyke as on of the two pre-eminent fictional forensic pathologists, but notes that Thorndyke sometimes over- interprets the forensic evidence for the sake of the plot. Thus Leadbeatter faults Thorndyke for excluding the possibility that the odontoid process (a small bone in the neck) of a corpse had been broken by the collapse of the house during the fire in Mr Polton Explains. Works Between 1907 and 1942, Thorndyke appeared in 21 novels and 40 short stories. =Novels= #The Red Thumb Mark (1907) #The Eye of Osiris (1911), published in the US as The Vanishing Man #The Mystery of 31, New Inn (1912) #A Silent Witness (1914) #Helen Vardon's Confession (1922) #The Cat's Eye (1923) #The Mystery of Angelina Frood (1924) #The Shadow of the Wolf (1925) -- inverted mystery\\"R.

The first story was The Blue Sequin which appeared in the Christmas double number of the magazine in December 1908. The stories were illustrated by H. M. Brock with both pen and ink drawings and colour wash drawings (in black and white), as well as photographs showing the evidence in the cases. The stories were published as a book by Chatto and Windus in late 1909. It is not clear if this edition of the book was illustrated, but the later 1916 edition certainly was. However the book had far fewer illustrations than the magazines, with only the six drawings by H. M. Brock shown here and only nine photographs. File:Illustration by H.M.

The rumor Zerzura was long rumored to have existed deep in the desert west of the Nile River in Egypt or Libya. In writings dating back to the 13th century, the authors spoke of a city which was \\"white as a dove\\" and called it \\"The Oasis of Little Birds\\".The Book of Hidden Treasures In the Kitab al Kanuz, Zerzura is said to be a city in the Sahara full of treasure with a sleeping king and queen. The city is guarded by black giants who keep anyone from going in and coming out. However, this may be a reference to the black Tebu people, nomads in Chad and Libya whose ancestors used to raid oases out in the Sahara. \\"The first European reference to Zerzura is in an 1835 account by the English Egyptologist John Gardner Wilkinson, based on a report by an Arab who said he had found the oasis while searching for a lost camel. Placed five days west of the track connecting the oases of Farafra and Bahariya, the \\"Oasis called Wadee Zerzoora\\" abounded \\"in palms, with springs, and some ruins of uncertain date.\\" Although tales of secret desert locales found by searchers for stray camels were common enough, Wilkinson's account was bolstered when later explorers found a number of previously unknown oases that had been named in his account along with Zerzura. But they did not find Zerzura itself.\\" More recently, European explorers made forays into the desert in search of Zerzura but never succeeded in finding it. Notable twentieth-century explorers Ralph Bagnold of Britain, and the Hungarian L√°szl√≥ (Ladislaus) Alm√°sy led an expedition to search for Zerzura from 1929-1930 using Ford Model A trucks. In 1932 the Alm√°sy- Patrick Clayton expedition reconnaissance flights discovered two valleys in the Gilf Kebir. In the following year, Alm√°sy found the third of the \\"Zerzura\\" wadis, actually rain oases in the remote desert. On the other hand, Bagnold considered Zerzura as a legend that could never be solved by discovery. The participants of the Zerzura hunt created the Zerzura Club in a bar in Wadi Halfa upon their return in 1930. Many of the club's members remained friends and several went on to serve as officers in the British Army during World War II. Many served in the Long Range Desert Patrol during the North African Campaign. Only Alm√°sy served Rommel's Afrika Korps and assisted the Italians. Zerzura the white city According to the historical writings from the scribes of an emir in Benghazi, Libya in 1481, a camel driver named Hamid Keila came to Benghazi in bad shape and recounted to the emir that he had been to the city of Zerzura. Apparently Hamid Keila and a caravan had been heading out from the Nile River to the oases of Dakhla (Darkhla/Dakhilah) and Kharga (Kharijah) and were caught in a vicious sandstorm that killed everyone except Keila who apparently survived under the shelter of his dead camel. After the storm passed, the man had emerged from the camel to find himself confused by the lie of the land because the storm changed all the familiar landmarks. It was when Keila was becoming delirious from having no water that a group of strange men found him. The men were said to be tall with fair hair and blue eyes, carrying straight swords instead of Arab scimitars, who then took the camel driver back to a city called Zerzura to tend to him. Zerzura was indeed described as a white city that was approachable through a wadi (valley) that ran between two mountains, and from the wadi was a road that lead to the gates of the city which had a carving of a strange bird above them. Within the city were white houses of inner luxury, palms, springs, and pools that were used by fair-skinned women and children for washing and bathing. Hamid Keila recounted that the Zerzurans, or \\"El Suri\\", treated him with kindness and spoke a strange form of Arabic that was difficult for him to understand but was carefully explained to him by the Suri, who apparently weren't Muslim because the women wore no veils and no mosques could be found in the city, nor did Hamid Keila hear any calls to prayer by a muezzin. The camel driver told this story to the emir months after being in Zerzura, and the emir asked him how it was that he came to be in Benghazi at present. Hamid grew uncomfortable with the questioning and told him that he had escaped from Zerzura one night. The emir then asked why it was necessary to escape if the Suri treated him with kindness, and the camel driver had trouble explaining. The emir suspected something strange and had Keila searched by his guards, who found a precious ruby set in a gold ring hidden on the man. The emir then asked how he got the ring, but Keila couldn't say. Figuring he'd stolen it from the Suri, the emir had Keila taken out into the desert to have his hands cut off. The emir believed the man's story because he and his men later went out into the wasteland to find Zerzura, but never did, though it is possible that the emir did not look in the right area of the desert. According to unknown sources, the ring supposedly came into possession of Libya's King Idris, who was overthrown in 1969 by Muammar al-Gaddafi and his Revolutionary Command Council. It is said that the ring has been studied by many experts who claim it is of great value, and it is speculated that it was crafted by Europeans in the 12th century, suggesting that the Zerzurans who had it before Hamid Keila stole it may have been the remnants of early European crusaders who got lost in the Sahara on their way to or back from Jerusalem and set up their own habitat in the desert. However, there oddly seems to be no information about the supposed ring made available by any sources, nor is there any evidence of its existence. Furthermore, because Hamid Keila was the narrator of the Zerzura tale, it is possible that he may have been the anonymous author of the Kitab al Kanuz (Book of Hidden Treasures) since his plight occurred in the 15th century, as the manuscript was also published at that time.

The film is a parody of COPS, set in the Star Wars universe. In the film, Imperial stormtroopers from the infamous Black Sheep Squadron patrolling the Dune Sea on the planet Tatooine run into some very familiar characters while being filmed for the hit Imperial TV show Troops. In a Reddit AMA in January 2018, Rubio stated that Troops is acknowledged by George Lucas as a canonical installment in the Star Wars franchise.I'm The Creator of Tag and Bink -- AMA About Them The film jump- started the modern fan film movement, as it was one of the first short films to bring fan films into the digital age, taking advantage of internet distribution and affordable production and special effects equipment, as well as fans with movie-quality costumes. Rubio shot the film on location on the El Mirage Dry Lake. Rubio finished the film while working at the Fox Kids Network, and was able to use well-known voice talent in his cast, including Jess Harnell, Cam Clarke, and announcer Bill Farmer. Plot An example of the film's comedic tone comes in the opening monologue, which spoofs the opening of COPS: \\"TROOPS is filmed on location with the men of the Imperial Forces. All suspects are guilty--period! Otherwise, they wouldn't be suspects, would they?\\" Adding to the comic tone are the accents from the stormtoopers which is very reminiscent to the accents heard in the movie Fargo. A small visual gag near the beginning of the film is that the stolen Imperial droid recovered from the Jawas appears to be Tom Servo from Mystery Science Theater 3000. In TROOPS there is a notable alternate (tongue-in-cheek) take on the deaths of Luke Skywalker's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, presenting their fate as the end result of a domestic dispute gone too far, rather than execution at the hands of Imperial forces. Indeed, the spotlighted members of Black Sheep Squadron attempt to mediate the dispute before Beru makes a disastrous move with a thermal detonator. The film ends with an incoming message about a possible disturbance in Mos Eisley Cantina. Reception The film has proven popular with Star Wars fans, and was awarded the inaugural Pioneer Award in the Lucasfilm-sponsored 2002 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards. Fan Films Quarterly listed Troops as one of the 10 most pivotal moments in fan film history in its Summer 2006 issue. In August 2010, Time magazine listed it as one of the Top 10 Star Wars fanfilms. In 2005, a new film called I.M.P.S. was released, made by several of the actors from TROOPS. Originally planned as a sequel, the film was first billed as TROOPS 2, but was renamed after fans learned that not only was Rubio not involved with the project, but that over the course of writing and production, the film had evolved into something entirely different (with a serious tone as opposed to the comedic one in TROOPS). On DVD Troops was released on the free DVD given away with the inaugural edition of Total Movie magazine, complete with commentary track by Rubio. It was also included as a bonus feature on the 20th anniversary DVD of the TV series COPS.TheForce.Net - Fan Films - TROOPS : Ten Years Later  References External links * TROOPS at TheForce.Net * IMPS website * Troops Category:1997 independent films Category:1997 films Category:American mockumentary films ","title":"Troops (film)"},{"id":"2487186","text":"An inverted detective story, also known as a \\"howcatchem\\", is a murder mystery fiction structure in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning,Inverted Detective Story - Pearson's Magazine usually including the identity of the perpetrator. The story then describes the detective's attempt to solve the mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are explained or resolved during the story. This format is the opposite of the more typical \\"whodunit\\", where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story's climax. The first such story was R. Austin Freeman's The Case of Oskar Brodski published in Pearson's Magazine in 1912.  Origin  R. Austin Freeman described how he invented the inverted detective story in his 1912 collection of short stories The Singing Bone. > Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in > two parts. The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, > setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances. The > reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in > possession of all the facts. It would have seemed that there was nothing > left to tell. But I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the > crime that he would overlook the evidence. And so it turned out. The second > part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers > the effect of new matter.This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled > \\"The Art of the Detective Story \\", which appeared e.g. in Dr. Thorndyke's > Crime File (1941). This was perhaps more common by the 1930s. Ngaio Marsh included a foreword on the subject in her 1935 novel Enter a Murderer. > When I showed this manuscript to my friend, Chief Detective-Inspector Alleyn > of the Criminal Investigation Department, he said: > > 'It's a perfectly good account of the Unicorn case, but isn't it usual in > detective stories to conceal the identity of the criminal?' > > I looked at him coldly. > > 'Hopelessly _vieux jeu_ , my dear Alleyn. Nowadays the identity of the > criminal is always revealed in the early chapters.' > > 'In that case,' he said, 'I congratulate you.' > > I was not altogether delighted.  Examples  One early and prominent example of this subgenre is Malice Aforethought, written in 1931 by Anthony Berkeley Cox writing as Francis Iles. Freeman Wills Crofts's The 12:30 from Croydon (1934) is another important instance. The 1952 BBC television play Dial M for Murder by Frederick Knott (later adapted for the stage and then adapted again in 1954 as a theatrical film by Alfred Hitchcock) is another example. Tony Wendice outlines his plans to murder his wife Margot in the opening scenes, leaving the viewer with no questions about perpetrator or motive, only with how the situation will be resolved. In Alfred Bester's 1953 novel, The Demolished Man, the reader learns in the first chapter that Ben Reich plans to murder a man; the rest of the novel is concerned with whether he will get away with it. The 1954 US film Dragnet uses this format as the viewer witnesses the killing of a small-time hoodlum and watches as police led by Sergeant Joe Friday work to apprehend the man's killer and the criminal leader at its heart. The short stories written by Roy Vickers about the Department of Dead Ends are nearly all of the inverted type. They deal with the eccentric methods used by Inspector Rason, a detective in a fictional division of Scotland Yard assigned to investigate cold cases, to solve crimes where more conventional methods have failed. Several of the Lord Peter Wimsey novels by Dorothy Sayers, such as Unnatural Death and Strong Poison, come near to inclusion in this category. In both books, there is from the start only one real suspect, whose guilt is more or less taken for granted by the middle of the book and who indeed turns out to be the murderer. In both books‚Äîas in some other Sayers detective novels, including her last, Busman's Honeymoon, the mystery to be solved is mainly, \\"why did this person have any motive to commit this murder\\" and \\"how did he or she do it\\" (which makes this format more similar to the majority of police investigations). Also, the short story, \\"The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers\\", had the villain not only discovered, but dead at the beginning. Lord Peter explained his investigation in detail, complete to the villain's stumbling into a vat of cyanide-and-copper-sulphate electroplating solution. The term \\"howcatchem\\" was coined much later, by American magazine TV Guide in the 1970s, after the United States television series Columbo popularized the format. The 1989 theatrical play Over My Dead Body, by Michael Sutton and Anthony Fingleton, depicts three elderly detective story writers committing a real-life locked room murder in Rube Goldbergian fashion. The audience is in on it every step of the way. In a variation of the typical inverted form, in this case the miscreants want to be caught and made to pay their debt to society. In the 1990s, some episodes of Diagnosis: Murder were presented in the howcatchem format, usually when featuring a \\"big name\\" (or at least recognizable) guest star. TV shows Monk, Criminal Minds, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent have frequently featured episodes structured as howcatchems, in which the viewer typically witnesses the killer commit the crime (during which the killer's identity is revealed to the audience), and then watches as the detectives try to solve it. (In at least one Monk episode, they had to prove that a crime has been committed). The shows have also used the whodunit format at times. The British television crime series Luther also made regular use of the inverted detective story structure. In the manga Death Note, Light Yagami, Misa Amane, and Teru Mikami are villain protagonists, known to be killers from the start. The series chronicles L, Mello, and Near as they gradually uncover the truth.

Photographers who participate in this genre may find themselves placed in harm's way, and are sometimes killed trying to get their pictures out of the war arena. HistoryOrigins= Roger Fenton was one of the first war photographers. He captured images of the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856) With the invention of photography in the 1830s, the possibility of capturing the events of war to enhance public awareness was first explored. Although ideally photographers would have liked to accurately record the rapid action of combat, the technical insufficiency of early photographic equipment in recording movement made this impossible. The daguerreotype, an early form of photography that generated a single image using a silver-coated copper plate, took a very long time for the image to develop and could not be processed immediately. Since early photographers were not able to create images of moving subjects, they recorded more sedentary aspects of war, such as fortifications, soldiers, and land before and after battle along with the re-creation of action scenes. Similar to battle photography, portrait images of soldiers were also often staged. In order to produce a photograph, the subject had to be perfectly still for a matter of minutes, so they were posed to be comfortable and minimize movement. A number of daguerreotypes were taken of the occupation of Saltillo during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, in 1847 by an unknown photographer, although not for the purpose of journalism.Daguerrotypes of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War John McCosh, a surgeon in the Bengal Army, is considered by some historians to be the first war photographer known by name. He produced a series of photographs documenting the Second Anglo-Sikh War from 1848‚Äì49. These consisted of portraits of fellow officers, key figures from the campaigns, administrators and their wives and daughters, including Patrick Alexander Vans Agnew, Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough; the British commander General Sir Charles James Napier; and Dewan Mulraj, the governor of Multan. He also photographed local people and architecture, artillery emplacements and the destructive aftermath. McCosh later photographed the Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852‚Äì53) where he photographed colleagues, captured guns, temple architecture in Yangon and Burmese people. The Hungarian-Romanian K√°roly Szathm√°ry Papp took photographs of various officers in 1853 and of war scenes near Olteni≈£a and Silistra in 1854, during the Crimean War. He personally offered some 200 pictures albums to Napoleon III of France and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in 1855.Carol Popp de Szathm√†ri's 1854 war photos: http://archweb.cimec.ro/scripts/PCN/Clasate/detaliu.asp?k=0F09ED4E21424AA580A2C07E81236E42 ‚Äì http://archweb.cimec.ro/scripts/PCN/Clasate/detaliu.asp?k=60BD72B84B1846309395BB55F437C925 Stefano Lecchi between 1849 and 1859 took photos of the battle locations of the Roman Republic using the Calotype processMemory documented =Establishment= Valley of the Shadow of Death, 1855, by Roger Fenton The first official attempts at war photography were made by the British government at the start of the Crimean War. In March 1854, Gilbert Elliott was commissioned to photograph views of the Russian fortifications along the coast of the Baltic Sea. Roger Fenton was the first official war photographer and the first to attempt a systematic coverage of war for the benefit of the public. Hired by Thomas Agnew, he landed at Balaclava in 1854. His photographs were probably intended to offset the general aversion of the British people to the war's unpopularity, and to counteract the occasionally critical reporting of correspondent William Howard Russell of The Times.Susan Sontag, Regarding the Pain of Others (2003; ) The photos were converted into woodblocks and published in The Illustrated London News. Due to the size and cumbersome nature of his photographic equipment, Fenton was limited in his choice of motifs. Because the photographic material of his time needed long exposures, he was only able to produce pictures of stationary objects, mostly posed pictures; he avoided making pictures of dead, injured or mutilated soldiers. Fenton also photographed the landscape ‚Äì his most famous image was of the area near to where the Charge of the Light Brigade took place. In letters home soldiers had called the original valley The Valley of Death, so when in September 1855 Thomas Agnew put the picture on show as one of a series of eleven collectively titled Panorama of the Plateau of Sebastopol in Eleven Parts in a London exhibition, he took the troops' epithet, expanded it as The Valley of the Shadow of Death and assigned it to the piece.The valley, called the \\"North Valley\\" by the British military, was just less than a mile wide and about a mile and a quarter long: = Further development = Ruins of Sikandar Bagh, 1858, by Felice Beato Fenton left the Crimea in 1855, and was replaced by the partnership of James Robertson and Felice Beato. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction.Baldwin, Gordon, Malcolm Daniel, and Sarah Greenough.

It is believed that for at least one of the photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow, the skeletal remains of Indian rebels were disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact. Fort Taku, 1860, by Felice Beato In 1860 Beato left the partnership and documented the progress of the Anglo-French campaign during the Second Opium War. Teaming up with Charles Wirgman, a correspondent for The Illustrated London News, he accompanied the attack force travelling north to the Taku Forts. Beato's photographs of the Second Opium War were the first to document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images.Lacoste, Anne. Felice Beato: A Photographer on the Eastern Road. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2010. . pp. 10‚Äì11. His photographs of the Taku Forts formed a narrative recreation of the battle, showing the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers.

During the American Civil War, Haley Sims and Alexander Gardner began recreating scenes of battle in order to overcome the limitations of early photography with regard to the recording of moving objects. Their reconfigured scenes were designed to intensify the visual and emotional effects of battle.Marien, Mary Warner, Photography: A Cultural History second edition (NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2006), pp. 99, 111. Gardner and Mathew Brady rearranged bodies of dead soldiers during the Civil War in order to create a clear picture of the atrocities associated with battle. In Soldiers on the Battlefield, Brady produced a controversial tableau of the dead within a desolate landscape. This work, along with Alexander Gardner's 1863 work, Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter, were images which, when shown to the public, brought home the horrific reality of war.Stokstad, Marylyn, Art History vol 2 revised 2nd edition (NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005), 1009.

Cook captured what is likely and sometimes believed to be the world's first photographs of actual combat, during the Union bombardment of Confederate fortifications near Charleston ‚Äì his wet-plate photographs taken under fire show explosions and Union ships firing at southern positions September 8, 1863. By coincidence, northern photographers Haas and Peale made a photographic plate of in combat September 7, 1863. The most lethal war in South American history was the Paraguayan War of 1865‚Äì1870. It was also the first occasion for South American war photography. In June 1866, the Montevideo firm of Bate y Compa√±√≠a commissioned the Uruguayan photographer Javier L√≥pez to travel to the field of battle.Until 1997 it was believed, wrongly, that the author of the Bate & Cƒ´a photographs was Esteban Garc√≠a. The identity of the real author was discovered by Alberto del Pino Menck (\\"Javier L√≥pez, fot√≥grafo de Bate y C√≠a. en la Guerra del Paraguay\\", Bolet√≠n Hist√≥rico del Ej√©rcito 294‚Äì297, 1997). See also L√≥pez used the wet-plate collodion process, making and developing his plates in a portable darkroom. The plates were sensitive to blue light only; his darkroom was an orange tent. This was the first time photography had covered South American warfare and his images became iconic.Mauricio Bruno, Fotograf√≠a Militar, in Fotograf√≠a en Uruguay: historia y usos sociales 1840‚Äì1930, (2011, Montevideo), Centro Municipal de Fotograf√≠a, ; accessed online , 21 May 2015. The firm did send a photographer to cover the Siege of Paysand√∫ the year before, but he arrived after the fighting was over. He captured images of the ruined town and corpses in a street. The Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878‚Äì1880 was photographed by John Burke who traveled with the British forces. This was a commercial venture with the hope of selling albums of war photographs. =20th century= Battle of Vimy Ridge, 1917, by Jack Turner World War I was one of the first conflicts during which cameras were small enough to be carried on one's person. Canadian soldier Jack Turner secretly and illegally brought a camera to the battlefront and made photographs.CBC News, P.E.I. photographer's secret documentation of WW I goes on display, November 10, 2015, CBC News In the 20th century, professional photographers covered all the major conflicts, and many were killed as a consequence, among which was Robert Capa, who covered the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, the D-Day landings and the fall of Paris, and conflicts in the 1950s until his death by a landmine in Indochina in May 1954. Photojournilst Dickey Chapelle was killed by a landmine in Vietnam, in November 1965. The Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima in 1945 was taken by photojournalist Joe Rosenthal. Unlike paintings, which presented a single illustration of a specific event, photography offered the opportunity for an extensive amount of imagery to enter circulation. The proliferation of the photographic images allowed the public to be well informed in the discourses of war. The advent of mass-reproduced images of war were not only used to inform the public but they served as imprints of the time and as historical recordings.Kriebel, Sabine, \\"Theories of Photography: A Short History\\", in James Elkins, ed., Photographic Theory (New York and London: Routledge, 2007), pp. 7‚Äì8. Mass-produced images did have consequences. Besides informing the public, the glut of images in distribution over- saturated the market, allowing viewers to develop the ability to disregard the immediate value and historical importance of certain photographs. Despite this, photojournalists continue to cover conflicts around the world. Profession today Journalists and photographers are protected by international conventions of armed warfare, but history shows that they are often considered targets by warring groups ‚Äî sometimes to show hatred of their opponents and other times to prevent the facts shown in the photographs from being known. War photography has become more dangerous with the advent of terrorism in armed conflict as some terrorists target journalists and photographers. In the Iraq War, 36 photographers and camera operators were abducted or killed during the conflict from 2003‚Äì2009.Committee to Protect Journalists, July 23, 2008 Several have even been killed by US fire; two Iraqi journalists working for Reuters were notably strafed by a helicopter during the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike, yielding a scandal when WikiLeaks published the video of the gun camera.Video posted of Apache strike which killed Reuters employees, Agence France-Presse, Apr 5, 2010 Hilda Clayton was killed when the mortar she was photographing accidentally exploded. War photographers need not necessarily work near active fighting; instead they may document the aftermath of conflict. The German photographer Frauke Eigen created a photographic exhibition about war crimes in Kosovo which focused on the clothing and belongings of the victims of ethnic cleansing, rather than on their corpses. Eigen's photographs were taken during the exhumation of mass graves, and were later used as evidence by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

Based in Queensland, the regiment is currently assigned to the 8th Brigade. The regiment's history can be traced back to 1932 when the University Rifles was formed. During World War II, the regiment's predecessor unit did not serve overseas, but many of its personnel were deployed as part of the 7th Brigade or within units of the Second Australian Imperial Force. After the war, the regiment was formed under its current designation. Since then, its size has fluctuated as its role has changed. Currently, it is responsible for providing training for Reserve officer cadets, officers and soldiers. Role and organisation The regiment is headquartered at the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus in Brisbane. Staffed by a cadre of Regular Army personnel, it is tasked with training officers and soldiers of the Army Reserve and currently provides pre-appointment training for officer cadets for 11th Brigade units, as well as promotion courses for all Reserve officers up to the rank of major. The regiment also provides driver training, and response force and high readiness courses for 11th Brigade soldiers. The regiment has a sub-unit, known as the North Queensland Company (NQC), which is based at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. QUR is spread across three main locations and currently consists of the following sub-units: * Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) ‚Äì St Lucia * Training Company ‚Äì St Lucia * Jacka Company of Staff Cadets (JCC) ‚Äì St Lucia * Administration Company ‚Äì Enoggera * North Queensland Company ‚Äì Lavarack Barracks, Townsville QUR conducts field training at the Enoggera Close Training Area (ECTA), Greenbank Training Area (GBTA), Wide Bay Training Area (WBTA), High Range Training Area (HRTA) and Canungra. History QUR was initially formed in 1932 as the \\"University Rifles\\" by two UQ graduates ‚Äì Captain Thomas Fry and Lieutenant James Mahoney ‚Äì who were officers of the Citizens Military Forces. Fry had been serving in the 9th/15th Battalion (the Oxley Regiment) and Mahoney had served in the 26th Battalion (the Logan and Albert Regiment).Smith 2002, p. 17. Previously university students had to complete their compulsory military training other units of the Citizens Military Forces, and the university had a long tradition of its members serving in the military.Smith 2002, p. 5. The University of Queensland was unable to raise enough men to form an entire unit, with its total strength only several hundred men. As a consequence in 1933 university sub-units were attached to existing militia units, with the first platoon attached to the 9th/15th Battalion (Moreton and Oxley Regiment).Smith 2002, pp. 17‚Äì18. In 1935, the 9th/15th was delinked and the university platoon became part of the 9th Battalion. The following year the detachment was raised to two platoons and the 9th Battalion was linked with the 49th Battalion; they subsequently remained linked until 1941.Smith 2002, p. 20. During World War II, the 9th Battalion, along with the rest of the 7th Brigade was sent to New Guinea to help stem the tide of the Japanese advance. At the Battle of Milne Bay a number of university men played an instrumental part in the first major Allied land victory in the Pacific. One of these was Mahoney who served as the brigade major and was mentioned in despatches, while Captain Jack Kelly served as adjutant of the 9th Battalion and Captain Murray Brown served in the 2/10th Battalion. Lieutenant Ron Dark, the first man to gain a commission through the university detachment, also served along the Kokoda Track with the 2/33rd.Smith 2002, p. 25. Later in the war, the 9th Battalion took part in the Bougainville campaign in 1944‚Äì45 where it took part in significant actions at Pearl Ridge, Artillery Ridge and along the Numa Numa Trail.Smith 2002, pp. 26‚Äì27. In all, throughout the war, a total of 120 men who had previously served in the university detachment were killed. Their names were later inscribed upon the Forgan Smith Building in the university grounds.Smith 2002, p. 28. In May 1948, QUR was formed, initially as an independent company designated as 'A' Company.Smith 2002, p. 33. An increased number of recruits arrived in 1950 and as a result in May that year the regiment was established as a full infantry battalion. This resulted in the raising of Support Company, consisting of Mortar, Medium Machine Gun and Assault Pioneer Platoons. An Anti-Tank Platoon was later added.Smith 2002, p. 42. Later the following year the regiment began training members to receive commissions as officers; the first member to graduate was Second Lieutenant Pat Shanahan.Smith 2002, p. 43. QUR was presented Queens and Regimental Colours on 19 July 1959 by His Excellency, The Governor of Queensland, Colonel Sir Henry Abel Smith.Smith 2002, p. 51. By the end of the 1950s the role of officer training became the focus of the regiment's existence.Smith 2002, p. 52. Following the end of the national service scheme resulted in a reduction in the number of parading members and as a result during the early 1960s regimental strength was no more than 160 at any given time.Smith 2002, p. 54. Following the re-establishment of the scheme in late 1964 following the commitment of Australian troops to South Vietnam, the regiment's ranks swelled and by late 1965 the regiment had a frontage of 438 personnel.Smith 2002, p. 63. This trend continued and by mid-1967, the regimental strength was 40 officers and 603 other ranks.Smith 2002, p. 64. At that time the regiment was made responsible for providing officers to all Northern Command units and was tasked with delivering training over the course of a two-year cycle; under this model 'A' Company took over the role of recruit training while 'B' Company became the officer training company.Smith 2002, pp. 65 & 71. The end of the national service scheme in 1972 resulted in a sharp decline in the regiment's strength; 92 personnel remained at the end of the year. Two years later there were only 37.Smith 2002, p. 74. During the 1974 Brisbane flood caused by Cyclone Wanda the regiment's depot in Walcott Street was damaged as were the regimental colours. The regiment was still able to mount an annual camp, however, further declining numbers resulted in discussions about disbanding the regiment. These were put off, although the regiment's existence continued to be tenuous as it was only able to graduate three officers in 1975 and two more the following year.Smith 2002, p. 77. That year women were officially permitted to join the regiment in support roles and after this the regiment began to recover.Smith 2002, p. 80. A major focus of the next two years was the recruitment and training of enough soldiers to put together a creditable parade for the presentation of new Queen's and Regimental Colours, which occurred on 9 July 1978. The colours were presented by Governor-General Sir Zelman Cowen, who had recently been the Vice-Chancellor of Queensland University. These replaced the old colours that had been damaged four years earlier, which were subsequently laid up in Emmanuel College Chapel located at the University of Queensland.Smith 2002, pp. 82‚Äì83. By 1982 the regiment had grown once more to about 600 members as it began recruiting from a number of different universities including Griffith University, the Queensland Institute of Technology and the Brisbane College of Advance Education.Smith 2002, p. 92. Two years later, the regiment consisted of a regimental headquarters, two rifle companies, a training company, support company (mortars, signals, demonstration and employment platoons and intelligence section), and an administration company, with an authorised strength of 540 personnel.Smith 2002, pp. 94‚Äì95. On 12 July 1986, the regiment exercised the Freedom to Enter the City of Brisbane and paraded before the Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson; later that year it exercised for the first time in Shoalwater Bay, deploying by air.Smith 2002, p. 100. The late 1980s saw a period of change as the regiment lost its mortar and machine-gun platoons and the way in which officer training was delivered in the regiment was changed. Instead of having officer trainees serve in the ranks and then as NCOs prior to commissioning a new system required such members to be \\"appointed\\" as officer cadets. This resulted in a reduction in the number of soldiers and NCOs in the regiment and the requirement to establish a new mess.Smith 2002, pp. 101‚Äì102. In 1992, the regiment's role became solely focused upon officer training when it became part of the 1st Officer Training Unit (OCTU). It was restructured at this time to consist of a regimental headquarters, an administration company and an officer training company.Smith 2002, p. 104. Changes in the way in which officer training was delivered resulted in a modular system that saw the regiment's involvement in the delivery of courses reduce during this time, and as a result the regimental began detaching personnel to instructional roles at places like the Royal Military College, Duntroon, the Land Warfare Centre and the School of Infantry in Singleton.Smith 2002, p. 110. During the early 1990s a number of former QUR personnel were involved in Australian peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bougainville and East Timor. Other members took part in the Gulf War.Smith 2002, p. 105. In 1996 and 1997, OCTU and the Regional University Regiment of Queensland (RURQ), formally based at Gatton were disbanded and their role subsumed by QUR. As a result, for a while QUR maintained a detachment at Gatton. In 1997 all the University Regiments were brigaded under the Royal Military College, Australia. In October 2000, the formerly independent North Queensland Company (NQC) came under the command of the Regiment. In July 2008 all University Regiments became part of the 2nd Division, with QUR being assigned to the 11th Brigade. Later, in 2017‚Äì18, all University Regiments, including QUR, were moved under the command of a dedicated training formation, the 8th Brigade.

It was formerly treated in a closely related but separate family Epacridaceae, but the various genera within Epacridaceae including Epacris have been revised in their relationships to each other and brought under the common umbrella of the Ericaceae. The genus Epacris is native to eastern and southeastern Australia (southeast Queensland south to Tasmania and west to southeast South Australia), New Caledonia and New Zealand. The species are known as heaths or Australian heaths. Description Plants in the genus Epacris are shrubs with simple leaves that are a similar colour on both surfaces and with flowers arranged singly in leaf axils near the ends of the branches, sometimes extending along the branches. Each flower is surrounded by many bracts and five, usually glabrous sepals. The petals are joined to produce a cylindrical or bell-like tube with five lobes on the end. There are five stamens which are mostly enclosed in the tube, and a single style which protrudes from the tube. The fruit is a capsule. Taxonomy and naming The genus Epacris was first formally described in 1797 by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles, who published the description in Icones et Descriptiones Plantarum. Cavanilles did not specify a type species but in 1983 Edward Groesbeck Voss nominated Epacris longiflora as the lectotype. The genus name (Epacris) is derived from an Ancient Greek word meaning \\"pointed at the end\\". Distribution Species of Epacris are found in all Australian states except the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Two species are found in New Zealand and one in New Caledonia.

The plot The tiny kingdom of the Ozure Isles, perched on five islands in Lake Orizon, surrounded by high mountains in a remote region of Munchkin Land, has little contact with the outside world--of Oz. The evil witch Mombi has turned her malice in the Ozure direction. After kidnapping Queen Orin, Mombi has left a fire-breathing lake monster named Quiberon in Lake Orizon to keep the natives prisoner.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 139, 149, 172. Even after Mombi was vanquished, Quiberon remains. Conditions grow worse when Quiberon orders the Ozurites to kidnap a mortal maiden to keep him company. Since Oz is a fairyland, the only mortal maidens are three American girls living in the Emerald City: Dorothy Gale, Betsy Bobbin, and Tiny Trot.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 16, 58-9, 221. Two Ozurites respond to the crisis in two separate ways. The heroic Prince Philador escapes from the islands to seek the aid of the Good Witch of the North, whose name is Tattypoo. The unheroic Akbad, the Ozure Isles soothsayer, steals a pair of magic wings, flies to the Emerald City, and kidnaps Trot. He also accidentally kidnaps the Scarecrow and an animated statue called Benny (short for \\"public benefactor\\") along with Trot.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 6, 15, 160-1, 209. In his search for Tattypoo, Prince Philador teams up with High Boy, a giant horse with telescoping legs, Herby the Medicine Man, an eighteenth-century doctor with a medicine chest in his own chest due to an incomplete disenchantment,Who's Who in Oz, pp. 92-3. and Jo King, a monarch with a sense of humor. Various adventures ensue, in strange locations like Cave City, and with even stranger beings like the Roundabouties and Shutterfaces. Eventually, matters are sorted out satisfactorily: the Wizard turns Quiberon into a great bronze and silver statue, and the good Witch Tattypoo is revealed to be the missing and amnesiac Queen Orin. She is restored to her family and kingdom. Trot becomes a princess of the Ozure Isles, welcome in their Sapphire City whenever she chooses to visit. By Ozma's decree, Jo King is made ruler of the entire Gillikin Country of Oz.

A member of the family Salamandridae, it is closely related to the spotless paddle-tail newt (Pachytriton labiatus). The spotted paddle-tail newt lives in streams and is characterized by its long, paddle-shaped tail used for propulsion.  Description  Pachytriton species are stout-bodied, smooth-skinned aquatic newts. Their heads are large and flattened, and they have conspicuous labial folds and short, stubby legs and toes. They breathe through both lungs and skin. P. brevipes ranges from 5.5 to 7.5 in as an adult. It has prominent labial folds, long digits, and smooth skin, which differs from the tuberculate skin typical of newts. The head, back, and tail of P. brevipes range in color from light brown to a dark chocolate brown and are covered in dark spots. The underbelly color varies considerably, from a very light brown to a solid black. Breeding males may develop bluish-white spots on the tail.  Behavior  Pachytriton spp. are known for their aggressive and territorial behavior, seen mainly in males, but occasionally in females, as well. P. brevipes is an aggressive hunter and feeder. It is carnivorous and will eat worms, insects, and small fish. The breeding behavior of P. brevipes is unknown.  Ecology  Pachytriton brevipes is native to the freshwater streams of southeastern China, and it thrives in cool, clean water high in oxygen. Current distribution is shrinking, most likely due to pollution and human encroachment on habitat. It is almost exclusively aquatic, though it will leave the water if bullied by a more aggressive individual.

Toying with the coin and thinking of Oz, he wishes himself back in the magic land -- and suddenly finds himself there, in the front yard of Jack Pumpkinhead.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 105-6. The sensible thing for Peter to do is to head for the Emerald City; and Jack is ready to act as his guide. They lose their way in the Quadling Country, where they blunder into Chimneyville and Scare City. By chance, Peter finds that his empty sack will fly from his hand and consume objects and creatures that are scooped into its open mouth, protecting him from danger. The two also find the magic dinner bell of Jinnicky the Red Jinn, which supplies Peter with needed provisions. The travelers adopt a third member for their party when they meet the doggerel-spouting Snif the Iffin (he's a griffin who has lost his \\"gr-\\" and is no longer able to growl). The three then encounter the unfortunate Baron Belfaygor of Bourne. He has been accidentally cursed with a rapidly growing beard that he must constantly cut away. Even worse, his fianc√©e, the princess Shirley Sunshine, has been kidnapped by the local villain, Mogodore the Mighty, the Baron of Baffleburg. Belfaygor had wanted a beard to have for his wedding to Shirley.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 15, 139, 190, 196-7.

The name came from QUBE's interactivity allowing viewers to select one of five films to be aired on the channel with their QUBE remotes. Viewer's Choice expanded with QUBE as the service launched in additional cities. Warner satellite-linked their QUBE systems, and Viacom, partnered at the time with Warner-Amex with the merger of their competing pay-TV services, Showtime/The Movie Channel Inc., joined the venture, adding Viewer's Choice to their own cable systems. By 1985 however, the QUBE project had come to an end amid huge financial losses, resulting in the sale of the Warner-Amex assets to Viacom. The PPV arm was split off from the rest of the Warner-Amex assets (which became known as MTV Networks) and instead was placed under the Showtime/TMC division. The service was launched nationally via satellite to cable companies in six states on November 27, 1985 with one channel of pay-per-view content, still under the Viewer's Choice name. A second channel, utilizing cassette tapes delivered to cable operators, was also available; this eventually evolved into Viewer's Choice II in 1988, which has since been rebranded and refocused as the Hot Choice service. Also in 1988, VC merged with a competing PPV service, Home Premiere Television, a joint venture of multiple cable companies. The service (which Viacom eventually gave up its stake in) retained the Viewer's Choice name, but utilized HPT's legal name, Pay-Per-View Network, Inc., until the rebrand to In Demand. Viewer's Choice continued to expand in the 1990s as it acquired other pay-per-view systems, along with cable companies deciding to outsource their pay-per-view systems rather than maintain them internally. As a result of this, as well as its various competitors gradually ceasing operations (including Cable Video Store and Request TV), the Viewer's Choice name was gradually phased out from on-air reference towards the end of the decade, generally only being referred to as \\"pay-per-view\\" in promos, on-screen graphics and voiceovers; the name remained in on-screen copyright graphics and on listings services such as the Prevue Channel until late 1999 when it was eventually renamed \\"PPV1\\". On January 1, 2000, the service changed the name and on-air look to iN DEMAND. The first program upon relaunch was Rave Un2 the Year 2000, a New Year's Eve concert performed by Prince, which was taped a couple weeks prior. Traditional analog service was eventually discontinued, and it is currently an all-digital service. In addition to Hollywood films and a limited selection of adult films, along with live and recorded concert programming, the service mainly distributes ring sports through pay-per-view, including the events of the WWE, All Elite Wrestling, Impact Wrestling, Ring of Honor, boxing events through HBO Boxing and Showtime Boxing, and independent circuits such as those with lucha libre. It also distributes out- of-market sports packages such as MLB Extra Innings, NBA League Pass, MLS Direct Kick, NHL Center Ice where provided (and formerly distributed ESPN Full Court/ESPN GamePlan until they were brought in-house in 2015 as ESPN College Extra), along with Too Much for TV, a service which features 'uncensored' content from the series of American Television Distribution and NBCUniversal Television Distribution's tabloid talk shows. It was the former distributor of Howard Stern's Howard TV component of his self-titled Sirius XM radio show until 2013. The UFC ended their relationship with all traditional wireline pay-per-view providers with UFC 235 (including iN DEMAND), choosing to go with a new distribution model through ESPN+, which is now its exclusive pay-per- view provider as of April 2019. Since this network's first inception, the first main Viewer's Choice/iN DEMAND channel (usually labeled as 'IN1' or 'PPV1' since 2000), signs off weekday mornings from 8AM to 11AM (Eastern Time) to feed promotions of upcoming movies and events of the next month to its headend affiliates. These are now sent digitally, though the channels continue to maintain routine maintenance periods in these low-purchased timeslots one or two days per month. Former iN DEMAND ident used until 2014. This was the latest variant. In 2010, iN DEMAND began providing a free movies on demand service, Vutopia, offered on Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. The service offered uncut older movies organized in themes. It was closed down on June 1, 2015. As of early 2012, as cable providers use more channel bandwidth for high-definition, video-on-demand and broadband services which do not require starting films at several intervals on several channels, providers such as Spectrum and Xfinity have removed most of iN DEMAND's linear channels - beyond 1-3 standard-definition and one high-definition channel for mostly event programming - from their public channel lineups, though the service offers up to 31 standard definition and 19 high definition channels, many of which are used internally within cable companies to distribute content to their VOD servers. In Demand shut down its final three linear movie channels on May 31, 2016.

Blanchflower, 150 N.H. 226 (2003), is a landmark decision by the New Hampshire Supreme Court which ruled that sexual relations between two females, one of whom is married, does not constitute adultery because it is not technically sexual intercourse. Background In 2003, David Blanchflower, a professor from Dartmouth College, filed for divorce from his wife on the grounds that she was having an adulterous affair with Ms. Robin Mayer of West Windsor, Vermont. As in most cases of divorce involving alleged adultery, the professor was seeking an \\"at fault\\" ruling against his wife. His wife admitted that she was having an affair with Mayer, but Mayer argued that the affair did not constitute adultery under New Hampshire law. Ruling After a lower court initially sided with David Blanchflower, the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled in favor of the two women, concluding that adultery must meet the definition of sexual intercourse under New Hampshire law. In the 3-2 ruling, the majority determined that sexual relations between two females cannot constitute sexual intercourse and, therefore, the affair was not adultery. The decision was based on the 1961 edition of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, which defines sexual intercourse as coitus (penile- vaginal sex). Reactions Reactions to the ruling were mixed, with some gay- rights groups condemning the ruling for its failure to recognize sex between people of the same gender. Other gay rights groups viewed the ruling as a victory under the law for one lesbian couple after many years of discrimination. Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), an LGBT legal rights advocacy group, stated: \\"Both the majority opinion and the dissent made clear that this case was not about the status of same-sex relationships in society or any formal recognition same-sex relationships receive, and the opinions were both, on the whole, respectful of same-sex intimacy.\\" See also *Lawrence v.

Filmography In 1925, with the advent of television on the horizon, William Fox of the Fox Film Studio empire envisioned a \\"grand\\" cinema experience to keep the public coming to the movie theaters. As such, he soon put full efforts behind enhancing the silent 35mm film showings by the addition of sound to be coupled to a wider than 35mm end product, with the hoped for result being a grand and lifelike experience for the viewers. This wide screen vision of William Fox soon resulted in his creating a partnership with Theodore Case and his assistant, Earl Sponable, pioneers of Sound on Film, with the partnership to be named the Fox-Case Corporation. The result was, first, the advent of Movietone Sound, then soon combined with the 70mm \\"Grandeur\\" wide screen camera, with the Grandeur film process becoming the first theatrically successful wide screen film process when Fox Film Studio's released their epic made-for-Grandeur film, The Big Trail, in October of 1930. The 70mm Fox Grandeur cameras were manufactured by Mitchell Camera Corporation, and were based on the Mitchell Studio Standard 35mm camera, enlarged to accommodate 70mm 4-perf film. The cameras were designated as Mitchell Model FC cameras, the FC designation most likely originally standing for Fox-Case, as the technical specifications and orders for the cameras were submitted to Mitchell by the Fox-Case Corporation. The first three Fox Grandeur production cameras to be delivered were FC-1, FC-2, and FC-3, delivered to Fox-Case Corporation in New York on May 1st, 1929, eventually followed by a total of 8 or 9 Fox Film Studio Grandeur Cameras. An additional four Grandeur cameras were delivered to MGM in 1930, plus one additional camera that was delivered to Feature Productions, also in 1930. William Fox himself had purchased the Mitchell Camera Corporation in mid 1929, with expectations of cornering the market on the cameras and equipment necessary for producing wide screen cinema. A small number of shorts and features were produced in 70mm wide Fox Grandeur in 1929, while Fox Studios prepared for their big release of a film specifically created to be shot in 70mm widescreen. The 1929 shorts and features included several issues of Fox Movietone News called Fox Grandeur News first shown May 26, 1929. Features shot in Grandeur include Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, the musical Happy Days (1929), directed by Benjamin Stoloff, Song o‚Äô My Heart (1930), a musical feature starring Irish tenor John McCormack and directed by Frank Borzage (Seventh Heaven, A Farewell to Arms). By April of 1930, Fox Film Studios was prepared to begin filming for their greatest Grandeur epic film and Western The Big Trail (1930), directed by Raoul Walsh, cinematography by Arthur Edeson ASC, in which John Wayne at age 22 played his first starring role. Song 'o My Heart was double-shot in both conventional 35mm and Fox Grandeur, with all action and singing performed separately for the two processes. Production began in November 1929, and the 35mm version debuted on March 11, 1930, in New York. The Grandeur version, however, shipped from the labs on March 17, 1930, was never released and may no longer survive, according to film historian Miles Kreuger., where Kreuger lays out an interesting history of early sound film recording techniques, and the audio advantages of Fox Grandeur. Filming of The Big Trail, which began in April 1930, was shot simultaneously in Grandeur and conventional 35mm movie film. Both versions survive, and differ significantly in composition, staging and editing. When the film was released on October 2nd, 1930, the only theaters equipped with the Grandeur projectors and wide screen were Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles and the Roxy Theatre in New York City. The Fox Grandeur process was first and foremost of a small number of widescreen processes which were developed by the major Hollywood studios alongside sound in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Although the format proved to be successful, due to the Great Depression that began with the fall of Wall Street in October of 1929, the Grandeur format then proved financially unviable for an industry still struggling to invest in the switch to talking pictures. Other theatres were resistant to making the large investment necessary, and the onset of the Great Depression put paid to the system's prospects. Ultimately, the widescreen aspect ratio did become established by the early-1960s. Fox used the Grandeur name again on a re- release of The King and I; this re-release was a Todd AO compatible 70mm reduction of the original CinemaScope 55 negative, advertised as being in ‚ÄúGrandeur 70‚Äù. Unlike the later Todd-AO system (which printed onto 70mm film), Grandeur did not use the same perforations as 35mm film, but instead had larger perforations on a longer pitch of 0.234 inch (5.95mm) compared to the 0.187 inch (4.75mm) pitch used by both 35 mm film and modern 70mm film. Although Grandeur used a four perforation pulldown (i.e. each frame occupied the height equivalent to four perforations on the film) rather than the five of Todd-AO, because of the longer pitch the height of the image, at 0.91 inch (23.1mm), was slightly greater than that of the 0.816 inch (20.73mm) Todd AO image. The image width was 1.84 inch (46.74mm) giving an aspect ratio of 2:1 and providing enough space for a Fox Movietone variable-density optical soundtrack of approximately double the width of that used on a 35mm print.Lobban, Grant \\"Preserving Wide Film History\\", , Journal of the BKSTS, 67:4, April 1985 See also *List of film formats *List of 70 mm films *Super Panavision 70 *Super Technirama 70 *Ultra Panavision 70 *Widescreen References * John Belton, Widescreen Cinema (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992), External links *Magnified Grandeur - The Big Screen, 1926-31, David Coles, 2001 * \\"Wide Film Cinematography:Some Comments on 70mm Camerawork From a Practical Cinematographer,\\" Arthur Edeson, A.S.C., American Cinematographer - September 1930 Category:Motion picture film formats Category:70 mm film Category:Fox Film Category:20th Century Studios ","title":"70 mm Grandeur film"},{"id":"2487316","text":"Magnolia dawsoniana, known as Dawson's magnolia, is a magnolia species native to the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan in China, usually at altitudes of 1400 to 2500 m.

It is licensed as a community-based campus radio station by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. The station broadcasts from Room 250 of the University Community Centre of the University of Western Ontario. History The station has its roots in a weekly radio show that was broadcast overnights on CFPL-FM starting in 1971. The University Students' Council subsequently launched a carrier current station, which was added to the city's cable FM service in 1978 and was available on AC radios in some university buildings at 610 kHz. The station was available on 91.5 through the Rogers cable service until it was moved to digital channel 943 in 2007. In January 1980 the station formally organized as CHRW and applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for an FM license, which was granted in 1981. The station moved to the public airwaves in October of that year, with 50 watts at 94.7 on the FM dial. CHRW's chief announcer, John R. Quain, played CHRW 94.7 FM's first song, \\"On the Air\\" by Peter Gabriel, on October 31, 1981. In 1987, CHRW increased its power from 50 to 5,000 watts and decreased it from 5,000 to 3,000 watts in 1990.Decision CRTC 87-100Decision CRTC 90-470 In November 2003, the station increased power again, to 6,000 watts, moved to its current frequency, (94.9 FM) and its tower was moved to One London Place from its previous location in the city's Cherryhill area.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-404 The station can be heard across London, and through several counties in southwestern Ontario, reaching past Woodstock, St. Thomas and surrounding communities between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. The station regularly broadcasts Western Mustangs sports games. One of CHRW's first on-air broadcasts in 1981 was Saturday afternoon football. CHRW continues regular live coverage of men's and women's basketball, and men's hockey, during the regular season and throughout the playoffs. In 2000, CHRW was recognized for Outstanding University Sports Coverage with the Fred Sgambati Media Award.CHRW wins Fred Sgambati Award The station is operated primarily by volunteers from both Western and the greater London community, although it is managed by a small team of industry trained staff and governed by a Board of Directors. In January 2018, the Western University Students' Council held a referendum to determine if the station was still relevant to students' funding. The vote resulted in a decrease in student tuition funding from $12 to $10.50 over a period of three years.

Pirates in Oz (1931) is the twenty-fifth in the series of Oz books created by L. Frank Baum and his successors, and the eleventh written by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was illustrated by John R. Neill. Plot Peter returns for a third time, washing up on the Octagon Isle after a shipwreck. He joins King Ato of the Octagon Isle, who has been abandoned by his subjects, and Captain Samuel Salt, who has been abandoned by his crew of pirates. Together, they sail on the Nonestic Ocean (which surrounds the continent which includes Oz and its neighbor countries). Meanwhile, Ruggedo, the deposed Gnome King, is back.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 145, 159, 185. He had been cursed with loss of speech by a magical \\"Silence Stone\\" at the end of his previous appearance in The Gnome King of Oz, and is scraping out a living as a peddler and beggar. He decides to answer an advertisement for the position of King of the Land of Menankypoo, whose people are also mute. These people demand \\"a dumb king\\" and Ruggedo meets this requirement. While serving as king, he recovers his ability to speak, joins forces with an ambitious magician, and also becomes leader of Captain Salt's mutinous pirates and Ato's rebellious subjects. He trains these followers into a military force, and attempts once again to conquer Oz. This is one of the few Oz books in which Ruggedo appears as a sympathetic character. The reader faces danger, overcomes obstacles, and experiences gratifying moments of triumph with him. Of the two narrative threads in the book, his is the more complex and suspenseful. (The other is Peter and Captain Salt and King Ato sailing around the Nonestic Ocean, visiting small islands.) Besides Captain Salt, this book introduces two notable characters: Clocker, a clockwork man who is not as trustworthy as Tik- Tok, and Pigasus, a flying pig whose riders are magically compelled to speak in rhyming jingles. Pigasus returns as a principal character in The Wishing Horse of Oz while Captain Salt and King Ato return in Captain Salt in Oz.

The company was established in 1976 as a direct marketing company, and later expanded into newspaper printing, as well as newspaper and magazine publishing outright. In the mid-2010's, Transcontinental began to exit the mass media industry by divesting its consumer-oriented publications, local newspapers, and its financial industry publications. In turn, the company began to make a number of acquisitions in the packaging sector to diversify beyond its existing printing business. Transcontinental is publicly-traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and has over 9,000 employees‚Äîthe majority of which are based in Canada, the United States and Latin America.  History  The company was founded in 1976 by R√©mi Marcoux and partners Claude Dubois and Andr√© Kingsley as a flyer-printing business. It generated $2.9 million in revenue in its first year of operations. In 1978, the company was renamed GTC Transcontinential Group, and it established a Door-to-door distribution division known as Publi-Home Distributors. In 1979, the company entered the publishing industry after acquiring Les Journal des Affaires and SIC. It also purchased the Imprimerie Chartier printing plant. In 1984, the company went public on the Montreal Exchange, and later the Toronto Stock Exchange. Transcontinental subsequently performed a number of acquisitions over the decade that followed, including 20 Telemedia-owned community newspapers in the Montreal area, The Hockey News, and a number of commercial printing companies (including Southam Inc.'s plants and printing division), among others. In November of 1999 Transcontinental acquired Canada's Information Technology publishing house Plesman Communications Inc., publishers of Computing Canada, CDN Computer Dealer News and Direction Informatique, among others. On January 29, 2000, GTC Transcontinental announced its acquisition of the publishing business of Telemedia for $150 million, including Canadian Living, Homemakers, and the Canadian editions of Elle and TV Guide. In 2002, Transcontinental acquired 12 newspapers and two printing plants in Atlantic Canada and Saskatchewan from CanWest Global for $255 million, in what was one of the company's largest transactions to date. In 2003, after receiving the contract to print La Presse, the company established its new Transcontinental M√©tropolitain printing plant. In 2011, Transcontinental reached an agreement to exchange assets with the U.S. printer Quad/Graphics, acquiring six of its Canadian plants (dating back to its predecessor Quebecor World) and a prepress in Markham, Ontario, in exchange for Transcontinental's Mexican operations, and a stake in a black-and-white book printing operation owned by the company. In 2012, R√©mi Marcoux stepped down as chair of the board, and was succeeded by his daughter Isabelle Marcoux. In December 2013, Quebecor Media subsidiary Sun Media announced that it would sell 74 of its community newspapers in Quebec to Transcontinental in a deal valued at $75 million. The Competition Bureau approved the sale in May 2014, under the condition that Transcontinental divest 34 of its Quebec newspapers for competition reasons. To comply with the conditions, Transcontinental sold 14 newspapers to other parties (however, only 3 of them were slated to remain as print operations, as the remainder were to become online-only publications under their new owners), and shut down 20 of them entirely. In March 2014, Transcontinental acquired U.S. packaging supplier Capri Packaging; CEO Fran√ßois Olivier considered flexible packaging to be a diversification into a \\"new promising growth area\\", amidst softening revenue in advertising, and decreases in its core printing businesses. In November 2014, TC sold 15 of its consumer magazines, including Canadian Living and The Hockey News, to Quebecor's Groupe TVA for $55.5 million. Transcontinental also received a contract to print magazines and marketing materials for TVA through 2021. The company stated that it wanted to focus more on its local properties. In May 2016, Transcontinental sold its 13 newspapers in Saskatchewan to Star News Publishing of Alberta. As a result, a TC plant in Saskatoon was also shut down. On December 1, 2016, Transcontinental Media acquired Rogers Media's financial industry publications, including Advisor's Edge, Avantages, Benefits Canada, Canadian Insurance Top Broker, Conseiller, Canadian Investment Review and the Canadian Institutional Investment Network. Rogers intended to focus more on its consumer publications. On April 13, 2017, Transcontinental announced that it had sold all of its properties and four printing plants in Atlantic Canada to SaltWire Network, a newly-formed parent company of The Chronicle Herald. On April 18, 2017, Transcontinental announced that it planned to place 93 of its remaining newspapers in Ontario and Quebec (including Montreal's M√©tro) for sale, in order to \\"contribute to the continued sustainability of local media and to foster greater connections with the advertisers and communities they serve\\", and to focus more on its educational publishing and specialty media operations. In April 2018, Transcontinental announced that it would acquire Coveris Americas for US$1.3 billion, its largest acquisition to-date, as part of an effort to bolster its flexible packaging business. Isabelle described the proposed purchase as one that would \\"[crystalize] our strategic shift toward flexible packaging and solidifies our commitment to profitable growth\\". The purchase would make Transcontinental the seventh-largest packaging company in North America.  Current operations  Packaging = Transcontinental established its packaging business in 2014 with the purchase of Capri Packaging, as part of a move to diversify beyond its declining print and advertising businesses. The division focuses primarily on the production of flexible packaging for consumer goods, such as bags and pouches. The division has grown primarily via the acquisitions of other vendors, having consolidated into one of the largest converters of flexible packaging in North America.  Acquisitions  * 2015: Ultra Flex Packaging, based in Brooklyn, New York * 2016: Robbie Manufacturing, based in Lenexa, Kansas, and Flexstar Packaging, based in Richmond, British Columbia * 2017: Les Industries Flexipak * 2018: Coveris Americas, Multifilm Packaging = Printing= Transcontinental Printing is the largest commercial printing companies in Canada, and one of the largest in North America.. In January 2016, the Toronto Star announced it would outsource its newspaper printing to Transcontinental with a five-year contract beginning in July 2016. The operations were shifted to its Vaughan plant, which led to the closure of the Toronto Star Press Centre. The same month, TC announced the closure of its Quebec City printing plant, resulting in the loss of 140 jobs. This was followed in November 2017 by the announced closure of its M√©tropolitain plant, primarily due to La Presse ceasing print and moving to a digital-only model. In May 2019, Transcontinental announced that it would close its Brampton plant by the end of 2019, resulting in the loss of 125 jobs. = Media = Transcontinental Media primarily published specialty business-to-business publications, particularly within the construction and financial industries (such as Les Affaires, and the former B2B publications of Rogers Media). It also publishes French-language educational resources under the √âditions Transcontinental, √âditions Caract√®re, and Groupe Modulo imprints. On September 19, 2019, the company announced that it would sell its financial industry publications to two companies. Several, including Les Affaires and Benefits Canada, were divested to Contex Media‚Äîa new company led by Transcontinential president Pierre Marcoux. The former Rogers B2B publications were sold to the Toronto-based Newcom Media, leaving only Transcontinential's construction industry unit Groupe Constructo, and its book publishing unit.

He was a student of Mikhail Lomonosov, whose works he frequently parodied. He was also a translator and editor at the Russian Academy of Sciences. Biography Ivan Barkov was born in 1732 in the family of an Orthodox priest. In 1744 he entered an Orthodox Seminary where he spent 5 years. In 1748 at Lomonosov's recommendation he was admitted to the Academic Gymnasium. Language and poetry were his fields of study. He was an uneven student, and he repeatedly was subjected to corporal punishment (whippings) for drunkenness, insolence, and slander against the rector. In 1751 he was \\"demoted\\" to a typesetter at the Academy's printing workshop, and in 1753 he was promoted to the position of a scribe in the Academy's administrative office. In 1755-56 he was Lomonosov's personal secretary, and in this period he wrote \\"A Brief History of Russia\\", which was published in 1762. In 1759-60 he edited the medieval \\"Nestor's Chronicle\\" for publication. In 1756 he was dismissed from the Academy for drunkenness and insubordination, after several reprieves, and reinstated until final dismissal in 1766. Barkov translated Horace's Odes into Russian in 1763, Phaedr's Fables in 1764, and Ludovico Lazzaroni's \\"Il Mondo degli Eroi\\" in 1763. He died in 1768. According to widespread legends tells that he died either in a suicide, with the autoepitaph –ñ–∏–ª –≥—Ä–µ—à–Ω–æ –∏ —É–º–µ—Ä —Å–º–µ—à–Ω–æ (lived sinfully and died ridiculously) \\"on a piece of paper inserted into his anus\\", or in an outhouse drowning. Poetry Barkov was highly regarded as an able interpreter and a poet. Since poetry was his hobby more than his job, he could afford to use simpler language in his work. Most of his poems are outrightly obscene or even pornographic, although very funny. Written copies of his work circulated Russia since their creation. Several works commonly yet erroneously ascribed to Barkov actually date from the 1840-60s. Legacy Ivan Barkov had a major impact on Russian language and later literati. His name is being brought up in any dispute on introduction of slang words into language, and, although his verses were unpublished for a very long time for being immoral, written copies of his work could always be found in student environments.

Haiku. Volume 1, Eastern culture. The Hokuseido Press, 1981. p123ff. From the time of Matsuo Bash≈ç (1644‚Äì1694), the hokku began to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in haibun (in combination with prose). In the late 19th century, Masaoka Shiki (1867‚Äì1902) renamed the standalone hokku as \\"haiku\\",Higginson, William J. The Haiku Handbook, Kodansha International, 1985, , p.20 and the latter term is now generally applied retrospectively to all hokku appearing independently of renku or renga, irrespective of when they were written.Van den Heuvel, Cor. The Haiku Anthology, 2nd edition, Simon & Schuster, 1986, p357. The term hokku continues to be used in its original sense, as the opening verse of a linked poem.  Content  Within the traditions of renga and renku, the hokku, as the opening verse of the poem, has always held a special position. It was traditional for the most honoured guest at the poetry-writing session to be invited to compose it and he would be expected to offer praise to his host and/or deprecate himself (often symbolically) while superficially referring to current surroundings and seasons. (The following verse fell to the host, who would then respond with a compliment to the guest, again, usually symbolically).Haruo Shirane, Traces of Dreams, Stanford University Press, 1998, , p.125  Form  Typically, a hokku is 17 moras (or on) in length, composed of three metrical units of 5, 7 and 5 moras respectively. Alone among the verses of a poem, the hokku includes a kireji or \\"cutting-word\\" that appears at the end of one of its three metrical units. Like all of the other stanzas, a Japanese hokku is traditionally written in a single vertical line.  English-language hokku  Paralleling the development of haiku in English, poets writing renku in English nowadays seldom adhere to a 5-7-5 syllable format for the hokku, or other ch≈çku ('long verses'), of their poem. The salutative requirement of the traditional hokku is often disregarded, but the hokku is still typically required to include a kigo (seasonal word or phrase), and to reflect the poet's current environment.  Example  Bash≈ç composed the following hokku in 1689 during his journey through Oku (the Interior), while writing renku in the house of a station master in Sukagawa at the entrance to Michinoku, in present-day Fukushima: Hearing the rice-planting songs in the fields, Bash≈ç composed a poem that complimented the host on the elegance of his home and region‚Äîwhich he associated with the historical \\"beginnings\\" (hajime) of f≈´ry≈´ or poetic art‚Äîwhile suggesting his joy and gratitude at being able to compose linked verse or \\"poetry\\" (f≈´ry≈´) for the \\"first time\\" (hajime) in the Interior (oku).

Matt LeCroy singled to lead off the sixth, then scored on a triple by Torii Hunter, who himself scored on Yankees second baseman Alfonso Soriano's error. The Yankees scored a run in the ninth on Soriano's two-out single with runners on second and third off Eddie Guardado, but Nick Johnson then grounded out to end the game as the Twins, despite using five pitchers, took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 2= Yankee Stadium (I) in Bronx, New York The Yankees loaded the bases with no outs on three singles in the first off Brad Radke, but scored just once on Bernie Williams's sacrifice fly. The Twins tied the game in the fifth on Torii Hunter's leadoff home run off Andy Pettitte. Radke hit Nick Johnson to lead off the seventh. After Juan Rivera's sacrifice bunt, LaTroy Hawkins relieved Radke and allowed an RBI single to Alfonso Soriano. Hawkins's error on Derek Jeter's ground ball put him at second and Soriano at third. Both scored on Jason Giambi's single and Mariano Rivera pitched two perfect innings for the save. The Yankees' 4‚Äì1 win tied the series heading to Minnesota. =Game 3= Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota The Yankees struck first in Game 3 on Hideki Matsui's two-run home run in the second off Kyle Lohse. They added another run next inning on Bernie Williams's single that scored Juan Rivera from second. A. J. Pierzynski's leadoff home run in the bottom of the inning off Roger Clemens cut the lead to 3‚Äì1, but neither team scored after that with Mariano Rivera again pitching two perfect innings for a save as the Yankees took a 2‚Äì1 series lead. =Game 4= Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota In the fourth, Jason Giambi doubled with one out, then scored on Bernie Williams's double. After Jorge Posada singled, Hideki Matsui's ground-rule double scored Williams. Aaron Boone popped out before Juan Rivera was intentionally walked to load the bases. Nick Johnson's double scored two more and knocked Johan Santana out of the game. Juan Rincon in relief allowed a two-run single to Alfonso Soriano, then walked Derek Jeter and Giambi to load the bases again. Eric Milton relieved Rincon and got Williams to ground out to end the inning. The Twins got on the board in the bottom of the inning on three consecutive singles off David Wells, the last of which by Michael Cuddyer scored Torii Hunter, but could not score again off Wells or Gabe White. The Yankees added a run in the eighth off LaTroy Hawkins when Boone hit a lead off single, stole second and scored on Juan Rivera's bunt single that was misplayed by Hawkins. Jeter's home run in the ninth off Eddie Guardado put the Yankees up 8‚Äì1 as they secured their place in the American League Championship Series with a blowout win. =Composite box= 2003 ALDS (3‚Äì1): New York Yankees over Minnesota Twins Oakland vs. BostonGame 1= Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland, California The Red Sox went up 1‚Äì0 in the first on Todd Walker's two- out home run off Tim Hudson, but in the third, Erubiel Durazo drove in two runs with a double off Pedro Martinez before Durazo himself scored on a single from Miguel Tejada, who was tagged out at second to end the inning. The Red Sox cut the Athletics' lead to 3‚Äì2 in the fifth on Jason Varitek's home run. In the seventh, Hudson allowed a two-out single to Nomar Garciaparra and was relieved by Ricardo Rincon, who allowed a home run to Walker to put the Red Sox up 4‚Äì3. In the ninth, Byung-hyun Kim walked Billy McMillon, then hit Chris Singleton with a pitch. After Mark Ellis struck out for the second out, Alan Embree relieved Kim and allowed a game-tying RBI single to Durazo, sending the game into extra innings. Oakland won it in the 12th when catcher Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez laid down a two-out, bases-loaded bunt single off Derek Lowe, scoring Eric Chavez from third base. This was Oakland's ninth consecutive playoff win over Boston in the wake of ALCS sweeps in 1988 and 1990, breaking the record for consecutive playoff wins against one team set by the New York Yankees against the Chicago Cubs with World Series sweeps in 1932 and 1938. Incidentally, the Yankees nearly got a chance to extend that streak the same year. =Game 2= Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland, California The Athletics won Game 2 with a five-run outburst in the second inning off Tim Wakefield. Jose Guillen walked with one out, moved to second on a passed ball, and scored on Ram√≥n Hern√°ndez's single. After Jermaine Dye was hit by a pitch, Eric Byrnes's double scored both runners. After a walk and ground out, Todd Walker's errant throw to first on Eric Chavez's ground ball scored two more runs. The Red Sox scored their only run of the game in the third on back-to- back doubles by Doug Mirabelli and Johnny Damon off Barry Zito. The Athletics were one win away from a trip to the ALCS. =Game 3= Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts In Game 3, three errors in the second allowed the Red Sox to go up 1‚Äì0 on Damian Jackson's fielder's choice. The Athletics had a potential rally stifled by controversial outs. Eric Byrnes was tagged out after failing to touch home plate after a collision with catcher Jason Varitek. Miguel Tejada was similarly retired after being obstructed by Bill Mueller while rounding third base. Obstruction was called by umpire Tim Welke. However time was not called by the umpire and Tejada stopped running thus giving the Red Sox time to tag him.The New York Times, sports page. Pete Thamel, published 10/5/2003 https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/05/sports/baseball-absorbing-a-blow- and-delivering-one-in-dramatic-fashion.html The one run scored in the inning sent the game into extra innings, where Boston won on a two-run walk-off home run by Trot Nixon off Rich Harden. This loss ended Oakland's playoff-record winning streak against the Red Sox at ten games, a record the Red Sox themselves would break in 2008 when they won their 11th consecutive playoff game against the Angels. =Game 4= Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts After Oakland starter Tim Hudson left with a strained left oblique after only one inning, the A's bullpen held the Sox to only three runs over the next seven innings. The Athletics went up 1‚Äì0 in the second on Jermaine Dye's bases loaded RBI single off John Burkett, but Johnny Damon's two-run home run after a walk in the third off Steve Sparks put the Red Sox up 2‚Äì1. In the sixth, Burkett allowed a leadoff single to Scott Hatteberg, who scored on Adam Melhuse's triple one out later, then Dye's home run put the Athletics up 4‚Äì2. Todd Walker's home run in the bottom of the inning off Ricardo Rincon cut the lead to 4‚Äì3. In the eighth, closer Keith Foulke allowed a one-out double to Nomar Garciaparra, then a two-out single to Manny Ramirez before both scored on David Ortiz's double. Scott Williamson earned the win with two shutout innings to close as the Red Sox's 5‚Äì4 win forced a Game 5 in Oakland. =Game 5= Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland, California The Athletics struck first in Game 5 in the fourth off Pedro Martinez when Scott Hatteberg walked with two outs and scored on Jose Guillen's double, but Jason Varitek's lead- off home run in the sixth tied the game off Barry Zito. Following a walk and hit-by-pitch, Manny Ramirez's three-run home run put the Red Sox up 4‚Äì1. The Athletics cut it to 4‚Äì2 in the bottom of the inning when Erubiel Durazo doubled with one out and scored on Miguel Tejada's double one out later. They cut it to 4‚Äì3 when Chris Singleton hit a leadoff double off Martinez and scored on Billy McMillon's single in the eighth. The A's loaded the bases on three walks in the ninth inning, but temporary closer Derek Lowe struck out Terrence Long looking to end the game. The win was marred by a violent collision between outfielder Johnny Damon and second baseman Damian Jackson. Damon was sent to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a concussion.

Without a good reference test theory, these experiments can be difficult to construct. Different theories often define relationships and parameters in different, often incompatible, ways. Sometimes, physical theories and models that nominally produce significantly diverging predictions can be found to produce very similar, even identical, predictions, once definitional differences are taken into account. A good test theory should identify potential sources of definitional bias in the way that experiments are constructed. It should also be able to deal with a wide range of possible objections to experimental tests based upon it. Discovery that a test theory has serious omissions can undermine the validity of experimental work that is designed according to that theory.

Early life Metcalf was born in Webster Groves, Missouri. As a youth he first trained on the drums but switched over to cornet permanently. As a teenager in St. Louis, Missouri he played with Charlie Creath. Career Metcalf moved to New York City in 1923 and participated in the fertile jazz scene there, playing with such legends as Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, Jelly Roll Morton, Benny Carter and King Oliver. In 1926 Duke Ellington hired Metcalf to play in his seminal orchestra, where his mellow tone contrasted with Bubber Miley's. In the 1930s Metcalf led his own bands and joined Fletcher Henderson's. In 1946 Metcalf moved to Montreal and formed the International Band, the first to play the nascent bebop style in Canada. Under his leadership the Caf√© Saint-Michel was the hub of the jazz scene in Montreal for a few years, with local musicians such as the young Oscar Peterson and visiting Americans such as Art Pepper, Fats Navarro and Sonny Rollins sitting in with the band. A drug bust prompted Metcalf to return to New York City in 1951. He released an album entitled \\"I've Got The Peace Brother Blues\\" in 1966 where he demonstrates that his style had indeed evolved since his days with Ellington. Death Metcalf was less active after falling ill in 1968 and died in 1981. Metcalf was survived by his wife, Shirley Metcalf, and his children, Louis Metcalf, Charles Metcalf, Jay Metcalf, Patrick Metcalf, and Savannah Metcalf.

The system is used primarily to save progress and unlockable content between games, participate in internet high score lists, access other exclusive features depending on the game, and access the Paseli digital currency service. The system uses online user accounts tied to a contactless smart card system called the \\"e-Amusement Pass\\". Users log into an e-Amusement enabled game by holding their pass up to the card reader and using a PIN. The system is similar to parts of the functionality of the rival Taito NESYS and SEGA ALL.Net systems.  Cards  Magnetic cardsOne of the five Entry Pass designs from DrumMania V2. The design is based on the background movie for the song, Magic Words. Prior to 2006, e-Amusement used magnetic stripe cards called Entry Passes that were sold separately for each game using the platform, either from an arcade desk or through a vending machine. Each card held data for one player, and typically came in 5 designs specific to the game (usually featuring character artwork). \\"Special\\" cards were also distributed from time to time, often alongside the console versions of certain games; these cards could sometimes be used to unlock special content in their respective game.  e-Amusement Pass  Older e-Amusement Pass design. In 2006, Konami began to phase out the original magnetic card system in favor of the e-Amusement Pass; a contactless smartcard that works across all games that were upgraded to use the new system. The new cards also use a 4-digit PIN for security. In event the pass is lost, its existing data can be transferred over to a new pass through Konami's website. The pass can also be linked to a mobile phone \\"Konami NetDX\\" account, allowing players to access their scores and other data on their mobile phone. On some games, customization of the game can also be done through the NetDX system. A smartphone with NFC support cannot be used as means for replicating an eamusement pass, due to the card's internal security codes. e-Amusement in Beatmania IIDX Beatmania IIDX is one of the prominent games using the e-Amusement service. It allows players to register scores and records, use a live Internet ranking system, and unlock new songs. When registering an e-Amusement Pass for the first time with a Beatmania IIDX machine, the player is issued a \\"IIDX ID\\". The IIDX ID can be used to select other players as rivals and track your progress compared to them. Users subscribed to the Konami NetDX service can also customize the game UI, by changing the graphics, system music, displayed categories and combo counter. Beatmania IIDX 9th Style was the first version to use e-Amusement, and is the only version which allows use of the card readers without a live network connection. All subsequent versions require a direct connection to Konami's e-Amusement service for the card readers to function. Beatmania IIDX 13: DistorteD was the first version to use the new \\"e-Amusement Pass\\", previous versions used the magnetic card system. e-Amusement in Dance Dance Revolution DDR SuperNOVA was the first ever DDR title to support the e-Amusement Pass. e-Amusement is used for a Rival system and for automatic uploading of scores to Internet Ranking. The boss songs Fascination MAXX, Fascination ~eternal love mix~, Healing-D-Vision and CHAOS were unlocked to machines with access to e-Amusement, but e-Amusement functionality was not available in America at the time. However, Fascination ~eternal love mix~ was unlocked on SuperNova in the US with a patch CD which also fixed sync issues. The song Beautiful Life by ARIA and the Nonstop course Back Dancers were also e-Amusement exclusives, only appearing from September to October to promote the release of the film Back Dancers. e-Amusement can also display player's high scores (similar to home versions) as well as display the overall machine, regional, or global high scores which would be presented during the loading screens. Most of e-Amusement functionality from SuperNOVA is retained on SuperNOVA 2. The game extends the functionality by adding the \\"My Groove Radar\\", a personal Groove Radar that is formed based on player's scores which can be used to track the player's advantages and weakness and a new level-up unlocking system called \\"Enjoy Level\\" . Workout feature, which was previously exclusive to home versions is integrated within arcade series using e-Amusement. e-Amusement is required to participate in certain events, such as \\"Zukin Wars\\". Players are also offered with \\"Original Courses\\", custom Nonstop (or Challenge) courses that can be created through e-Amusement mobile site. A North American e-Amusement network tested for DDR SuperNOVA2, with the first (and only) connected unit located at the \\"Brunswick Bowling and Billiards\\" location in Naperville, Illinois. In DDR X, along with the reintroduced Edit Data feature (which was absent in SuperNova series), players can transmit the edits to other machines with active e-Amusement that are frequently played by players. Players can also pay fees to e-Amusement mobile site to enable certain options, such as displaying player's high scores during gameplay and change the position of combo counter. Outside of Asia, no DDR X machines were connected to the e-Amusement network. The new cabinet design for X also introduced a revised card reader that supports data from e-Amusement. From DDR SuperNOVA2 to DDR X2, unlock codes were required to unlock hidden content in North American and European builds of DDR. In DDR X3 vs 2ndMix, the Target Score function is introduced which can display the machine's (and regional) high scores during song selection screen. The North American release of DanceDanceRevolution A is the first game to support e-Amusement outside of Asia. Since June 2017, an e-Amusement pass is now required to access CHALLENGE-only charts, which removes DDRMAX2's Challenge remixes, the GROOVE RADAR Specials and X-Specials from being playable without using an e-amusement pass. e-Amusement in GuitarFreaks/DrumMania and GuitarFreaks 8th Mix DrumMania 7th Mix were the first GF/DM games to support e-Amusement. GuitarFreaks and DrumMania V3 was the first version to use the new \\"e-Amusement Pass\\". The two games support rivals, unlocks, and also allow players to battle against other players over the e-Amusement network. e-Amusement support was also provided outside Japan during a location test of an English build of GuitarFreaks and DrumMania V4 at the same Naperville bowling alley e-Amusement made its American debut at with DDR SuperNOVA 2. e-Amusement in Otomedius The use of e-Amusement will allow Internet Ranking and players will be accumulate special and powerful items as the player increases experience. e-Amusement in Pop'n Music Pop'n Music uses e-Amusement extensively throughout the recent releases. Since the release of Pop'n Music 9, unlocks have been exclusively remained available to arcades which subscribe to the e-Amusement service. It allows players to save scores, unlock new modifiers, songs, and characters, all varying from one card to another. Pop'n Music 14: Fever was the first version to use the new \\"e-Amusement Pass\\", previous versions used the magnetic card system. e-Amusement in Silent Hill: The Arcade The use of e-Amusement will allow Internet Ranking and players will be able to start at stages where they previously cleared, instead of playing the game from scratch. e-Amusement in World Soccer Winning Eleven 2008 Arcade The use of e-Amusement is much similar to the usage of the magnetic cards in Virtua Striker series, allowing players to configure strategies and formations on the move.

It is situated on the North Sea coastline in an area known as Holderness, lying approximately south of the seaside resort of Hornsea. The civil parish is formed by the village of Mappleton and the hamlets of Cowden, Great Cowden and Rolston. According to the 2011 UK census, Mappleton parish had a population of 342, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 249. The parish church of All Saints is a Grade II* listed building. History In 1823 Mappleton was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Holderness and the Liberty of St Peter's. The ecclesiastical parish and church living was under the patronage of the Archdeacon of the East Riding A public school was established in 1820 by subscription and run under the ideas of educationalist Andrew Bell. Population at the time was 187, including the hamlet of Rolston (then 'Rowlston'). Occupations included six farmers, a carpenter, a corn miller, and a schoolmaster who was also the parish clerk. Two carriers operated between the village and Hull twice weekly. In 1991, sea defences were built in order to protect the village and B1242 main road from intense sea erosion that had threatened it - Holderness is the most rapidly eroding coastline in Europe. The cliffs had been eroded at a rate of between per year on average. The ¬£2 million project created two large rock groynes to trap materials that are carried in the waves during longshore drift as well as revetments to break the waves. In order to protect the cliffs from undercutting, their gradient was also reduced artificially. The success of this project has created a larger higher sandy beach for Mappleton, and the erosion has slowed to a point where it is no longer a threat to the settlement. Due to these sea defences, the area directly south of the village now suffers from an even greater rate of erosion.

After the Battle of White Mountain Ladislav Velen of ≈Ωerot√≠na lost all his manors. Consequently, one of the emperor's favourites Karl Eusebius of Liechtenstein, second prince of Liechtenstein and founder of today's renowned Liechtenstein art collection, gained power over the lordship in 1624 and united it with his lordship of Ruda nad Moravou. The 18th century saw the greatest incidences of Black Death (1700, 1705) and twice the march-through of looting Prussian troops, burning down many villages in both Silesian Wars. The area reobtained stability. 1833 a wooden pilgrimage church was erected on K≈ô√≠≈æov√° mountain right above ƒåerven√° Voda and the village's elementary school got a second class. In 1846 the village gained the right to hold markets. In implication of the Revolution of 1848 came the fall of the patrimonial regime. The land reform of 1850 made ƒåerven√° Voda part of the political district of Hohenstadt. Did most of the villagers made a living from agriculture till than, the second part of the 19th century was molded by the commencing industrialization, foremost by textile fabrication in 1850. In 1865 ƒåerven√° Voda was connected to the state's primary road network with the inauguration of the Kaiserstra√üe (today's state road 11). By 1866 Prussian troops once more passed through the village without causing greater damages. After the Reichsvolksschulgesetz (Imperial Law of Elementary School) was passed in 1869, ƒåerven√° Voda saw the foundation of the first B√ºrgerschule (Citizen or Secondary School) in all of Moravia in 1875.Villages in Grulicher (Kr√°l√≠ky) Land \\"Eagle Mountain Society\\" website (German), Retrieved 4 March 2012 With the opening of a branch line from Kr√°l√≠ky to ≈†t√≠ty, ƒåerven√° Voda was connected to the railway network in 1899 and concurrently experienced its economical and social heyday. 1910 existed several cotton spinneries (and a total of 44 textile productions). After the World War I Moravia and thus Rothwasser/ƒåerven√° Voda became part of the newly formed First Republic of Czechoslovakia. While, due to cut historical trade- ties commercial development halted, mild tensions aroused among the majoritarian German speaking population towards the newly Czech-dominated administration. A Czech-Minority School was formed 1919 and an Old Catholic Church was erected in 1929. In 1930 the market town had a population of 2,526. =World War II= After the shameful Munich Agreement, part of the Appeasement Policy against Nazi Germany, in 1938, ƒåerven√° Voda was occupied by the Nazi's Wehrmacht arriving from Mittelwalde (today Miƒôdzylesie/Silesia) between 1 and 10 October 1938. ƒåerven√° Voda was incorporated into the newly formed province of Sudetenland, as a part of the Hohenstadt District (which was congruent with the Czechoslovakian district of Z√°b≈ôeh). Thus Czechoslovakia had lost all her heavily fortified borderlands, leaving her indefensible.

Yet even before first unlawful expulsions and cruelties occurred against the German-Moravians, irrespective from their political attitude during the war. Between 23 April and 25 October 1946, 2,156 people were deported in seven transports, leaving only 37 German-Moravians in ƒåerven√° Voda. The village was resettled by Czech- Moravians from Ti≈°≈àov. On K≈ô√≠≈æov√° mountain arouse a military training ground, (1960 demolition of the devastated small wooden pilgrimage church was carried out), used by the Red Army 1969-1990, which maintained a military foothold in all of the Warsaw Pact states, such as the ƒåSSR. In 1949, ≈†anov u ƒåerven√© Vody was merged strawith ƒåerven√° Voda municipality. By the adminitive reform of 1960 ƒåerven√° Voda was greatly enlarged by affiliating its surrounding villages.

Trampier (April 22, 1954 ‚Äì March 24, 2014) was an artist and writer whose artwork for TSR, Inc. illustrated some of the earliest editions of the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. Many of his illustrations, such as the cover of the original Players Handbook, became iconic. Trampier was also the creator of the Wormy comic strip that ran in Dragon magazine for several years. At the height of his career in the late 1980s, Trampier suddenly withdrew from the gaming world and became a social recluse. Although the reasons for this break were unclear, a disagreement with TSR is possible; it is clear that later in life, Trampier wanted nothing to do with TSR or its successor, Wizards of the Coast. For many years, Trampier's location was unknown to anyone and rumors circulated that he had died; his brother-in-law Tom Wham denied this, although Wham admitted that even he did not know where Trampier was or what he was doing. Trampier was rediscovered by accident, working as a taxi driver in Carbondale, Illinois, when a local reporter did a ride along and‚Äîwithout knowing Trampier's background‚Äîsubsequently published Trampier's name and photograph. Several companies and individuals immediately approached Trampier to commission new pieces of art, re-publish some of his most iconic pieces, or have Trampier appear as a guest of honor at conventions; Trampier refused and indicated he wished to be left alone. A decade later, when Trampier's taxi company went out of business and he discovered he had cancer, he began to entertain the idea of republishing some of his best known artwork in book form. He also agreed to end his long isolation from the gaming community by appearing as a special guest at a Carbondale gaming convention scheduled for April 2014, but he died three weeks before the convention. Career Cover of original AD&D; Players Handbook, art by Trampier In 1977, TSR, Inc. started to develop a new version of their popular Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game called Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;). Unlike TSR's previous rulebooks, which had been low-quality paperback booklets, the rulebooks for AD&D; would be high-quality lithographed hard covers featuring full color wrap-around cover art and many interior black & white illustrations. The first book to be published was the Monster Manual in 1977, and Trampier, along with fellow artists David Sutherland and Tom Wham, provided artwork for the manual. Tim Kask, editor of Dragon magazine, stated in a review that the book's profuse illustrations were \\"outstanding\\", and that the illustrations \\"in themselves would warrant the cover price\\". It was the next hardcover rulebook, the Player's Handbook, that would secure Trampier his reputation while he was still in his mid-twenties. Trampier's cover depicted a temple dominated by a huge, devilish statue, being looted by a group of adventurers; the back cover included a representation of the book's author, Gary Gygax. The cover image became synonymous with the game until the cover art was replaced with a new illustration in 1982. Trampier also created several pieces of interior art for the Player's Handbook. He continued to be an important contributor to the TSR brand in the company's early years. Some of his more notable works included: * Cover art and some of the interior illustrations for Gamma World role-playing game (1978). * Map board for the wargame Divine Right (1979). * Cover art for the Dungeon Master's Screen (1979). [Winner of the Gamer's Choice Award for 1979] * Cover art for the AD&D; adventure The Village of Hommlet (1979) * Interior art for the third and fourth hardcover rulebooks, Dungeon Masters Guide (1979) and Deities & Demigods (1980). * Interior art for many AD&D; adventures. =Wormy= The September 1977 issue of Dragon (Issue #9) featured a new 6-panel comic, Trampier's Wormy. The first frame featured the title character, a cigar- chomping, pool hustling, wargaming dragon, and subsequent issues revealed the cast of goblins and ogres who were his neighbors and friends. The stories were told from the point of view of the antagonists of the Dungeons & Dragons game; the wizards, warriors and other protagonists that players would be expected to portray were inevitably presented as unwelcome intruders. Wormy continued to appear in Dragon for the next 10 years, until Issue #132 (April 1988). =Titan= In 1980, Trampier and Jason McAllister co-designed a \\"monster slugathon\\" wargame called Titan, for which Trampier also executed the artwork. The purpose of the game was simply to defeat other players' armies, using the victories to advance in power until there was only one army left. Trampier and McAllister self-published the game through Gorgonstar Company. It was re- published by Avalon Hill in 1982 and gained a measure of popularity. Articles about Titan were featured in several issues of Avalon Hill's General magazine, and it remained in print until Avalon Hill's demise in 1998. In 2008, Valley Games printed a new edition of Titan without Trampier's artwork. Disappearance In the late 1980s, David Trampier suddenly disappeared. The last installment of Wormy appeared in the April 1988 issue of Dragon (#132); despite the fact that the comic was in the middle of an unfinished storyline, no further Wormy comics were ever published. In the August 1988 issue of Dragon, (issue #136), in response to a reader letter, the Dragon editors wrote, \\"We regret to announce that 'Wormy' will no longer be appearing in Dragon Magazine. We are looking into the possibility of adding another graphic series in the future.\\" Kim Mohan, then editor of Dragon, told Phil Foglio that payments for Wormy and other royalty payments sent to Trampier had been returned unopened. Foglio explained that \\"When an artist's checks are returned uncashed, he is presumed dead.\\"Foglio related this conversation to Chris Adams at Dexcon 4 in 1995 (Adams 1998) Reappearance In February 2002, Arin Thompson did a night-shift ride along with a local Yellow Taxi driver for an article for Southern Illinois University's student newspaper. The taxi driver was David Trampier, who told Thompson he had moved to Carbondale from Chicago about eight months previously. Thompson, who did not know of Trampier's work as an artist, published the story and Trampier's photograph in The Daily Egyptian on February 15, 2002. Word circulated that Trampier was still alive; several companies and individuals contacted him to inquire about commissioning new artwork, republishing old artwork, or appearing at conventions. Trampier rebuffed all attempts to draw him back into the fantasy gaming world and continued to drive his taxi. In 2003, Wizards of the Coast stated that Trampier was \\"alive and well\\" but \\"not currently working in gaming or comics\\". In 2004, Trampier's fellow artist and brother-in-law Tom Wham stated that he believed Trampier \\"still exists somewhere in Illinois\\". In 2008, Trampier visited Castle Perilous Games & Books, a game store in Carbondale, to see the new edition of Titan that had been published by Valley Games. That was the only contact he made with the games community until several years later. Death In late 2013, several misfortunes struck Trampier. He suffered a mild stroke, he lost his job when the Yellow Taxi Company went out of business, and he discovered that he had cancer. Needing money, Trampier contacted Scott Thorne, the owner of Castle Perilous Games & Books, and offered to sell eight of his original pieces of artwork, including the original cover art for the 1979 Dungeon Master's Screen. Thorne bought the artwork, and tried to convince Trampier to have his Wormy comics republished. Trampier was suspicious of the offer, and wanted to ensure that TSR would not have any part of the publication; he seemed surprised by the news that TSR had been taken over by Wizards of the Coast almost 20 years previously. Thorne suggested that Troll Lord Games might be a good publisher to approach. Trampier accepted an invitation to display some of his original artwork at Egypt Wars, a local games convention; it would be his first public connection to fantasy gaming since his disappearance 25 years before. Representatives of Troll Lord Games were also scheduled to be at the convention, and Thorne hoped Trampier might talk to them about a publishing deal. However, Trampier suddenly died on March 24, 2014, three weeks before the convention. Influence Rich Burlew (creator of The Order of the Stick) has voiced great respect for the place Wormy held as an early D&D; comic strip, indicating in an interview that he felt awed at his comic being published on Dragon's back page, where Wormy once ran, adding that he felt he was \\"not worthy to shine Wormy's feet.\\" In the last issue of Dragon magazine (#359, September 2007), Burlew included in his OOTS comic a number of references to comics that had appeared in the magazine over its long run, including a Wormy-like dragon (complete with hat and cigar) fleeing before Wizards of the Coast turned the dungeon electronic.

Purpose Twin-scaling is practiced by professional growers and skilled amateurs to increase bulbs that would naturally propagate very slowly, or to speed up the production of desirable cultivars. Using twin-scaling it is possible to multiply one bulb into 16 to 32 (or more) viable bulbs in a couple of years, whereas natural propagation might only lead to a doubling every two years or so. It is one of a number of propagation techniques (such as \\"scooping\\", \\"scoring\\" and \\"chipping\\") based on the fact that an accidentally damaged bulb will often regenerate by forming small bulblets or bulbils on the damaged surface. Commercial growers have obtained as many as 100 twin-scales from a single bulb. Method The dormant bulb which is to be twin-scaled has its surface sterilized by removing its dry tunic and carefully trimming off its roots and any dead tissue, while leaving a layer of sound basal plate intact, then dipping the clean bulb in dilute bleach (or another suitable disinfectant). The bulb is then sliced cleanly from top to bottom several times, creating 8 or 16 segments, depending on the size of the bulb. At this stage the segments are called \\"chips\\" (many growers are content with simply chipping a bulb into 4 or 8 and do not divide the bulb further). True twin-scaling involves further subdivision of the chips to create pairs of scales, joined together by a small part of the basal plate. The twin-scales are then treated with fungicide before being mixed with moist, sterile Vermiculite, sealed in plastic bags and left in a fairly warm, dark location until new bulblets form. Some species may require alternate periods of warm and cool storage to initiate bulblet growth. The tiny bulbs are planted into pots or trays of compost and allowed to grow on for a year or more, until they are large enough to survive in individual pots or the open ground. They usually take several years to reach flowering size, although some bulblets of Galanthus have been known to flower in their first year.

The area is located just off Junction 14 of the M50 motorway. Neighbouring areas include Sandyford, Kilternan, Ballyogan, Leopardstown, Carrickmines, Belarmine and Glencullen. Stepaside village developed in the 18th and early 19th centuries when the adjacent medieval settlement of Kilgobbin was bypassed by a new stretch of the Enniskerry Road, built from what is now Lamb's Cross through to Kilternan. Stepaside became a new staging post along this route, while Kilgobbin Road with its coaching inn (now Oldtown House) was no longer used by goods traffic or stagecoaches. Stepaside is served by Dublin Bus routes 44, 47 and 118 and Go-Ahead Ireland 63 and 63a. The Luas Green Line has been extended to Cherrywood and the nearest stops (Glencairn and The Gallops) are approximately from the centre of Stepaside. Development Kilgobbin Cross is a 10th century cross in Stepaside Previously a separate rural village, as of the early 21st century, Stepaside has been absorbed by the Dublin conurbation to the north and east, and has seen accompanying residential development and population growth.

According to traditional accounts, during the 2nd century BCE a subgroup of Rishikas migrated to southwestern India and settled there, crossing Afghanistan, Balochistan, Sindhu and Sovira. Theories regarding historical identityKamboja‚ÄìRishika connection= Sanskrit scholar Ishwa Mishra believes that the Rishikas were synonymous with the Parama Kambojas. V. S. Aggarwala also relates the Parama Kambojas of the Pamir Mountains to the Rishikas of the Mahabharata,See: The Deeds of Harsha: Being a Cultural Study of BƒÅ·πáa's Harshacharita, 1969, p 199, Dr Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala. located in Shakdvipa.India as Known to PƒÅ·πáini: A Study of the Cultural Material in the Ash·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´, 1953, p 64, Dr Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala ‚Äì India. According to B. N. Puri, the Kambojas were a branch of the Tukharas.Buddhism in Central Asia, p. 90.

The Sabhaparava of the Mahabharata describes the Lohas, Kambojas and Rishikas as neighboring tribes west of the Himalayas.MBH II.27.25 The Adiparva of the Mahabharata compares the Kambojas and the Rishikas, describing them both as \\"despised\\" people. The Kambojan king Chandravarma is described as an incarnation of Daitya Chandra and the sage, Rishika (\\"from the Rishika tribe\\"), is described as an incarnation of Danva Arka. In one version of the Mahabharata Chandravarma is a Rishikan, rather than a Kambojan, king. The Kambojas and Rishikas appear side- by-side in a verse.MBH 1/67/31-32. In the Udyogaparava of the Mahabharata,Mahabharata 5.5.15, see the verse above. the Kambojas and Rishikas are described as one people (Kambojarishika). A scholarly class of people is implied, according to some authorities, by the name \\"Rishika\\" in the Matsya and Vayu Puranas. The Kambojas, in the Dronaparava section of the Mahabharata, are also described as a scholarly people: :Sanskrit: :ye tvete rathino rajandrishyante kanchanadhvajah. :ete durvarana nama Kamboja yadi te shrutah.43 :shurashcha kritavidyashcha dhanurvede cha nishthitah. :sa.nhatashcha bhrisha.n hyete anyonyasya hitaishinah.44 :akshauhinyashcha sa.nrabdha dhartarahhtrasya bharata. :‚Äî (MBH 7.112.43‚Äì44) :English translation: Those other car-warriors with golden standards, O king, whom you see, and who, like the wild elephants are difficult of being resisted, they are called the Kambojas.

They constitute a full Akshauhini of wrathful warriors. =Other theories= Some scholars have proposed that the Rishikas are the Yuezhi of ancient Chinese sources,India as Known to PƒÅ·πáini: A Study of the Cultural Material in the Ashtadhyayi, 1953, p 321, Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala. or the Asii cited by the ancient Greeks.Chandra Chakraberty ‚Äì Ethnology; Literary History of Ancient India in Relation to Its Racial and Linguistic Affiliations, 1953, pp 148, 152, Chandra Chakraberty ‚Äì Sanskrit literature.

Pliny only borrowed the information earlier prepared by Megasthenese, who is believed to have been a Greek ambassador in the court of Chandragupta Maurya after the Chandragupta Maurya had won war against Seleucid in about 302 BCE. The Taxillae and Peucolaitae are Gandharans of the Indian traditions while the Asoi, Osii/Orsi and Aseni appear yet other variants of the Assaceni (Aspasioi) and Assacani (Assakenoi)‚Äîthe Asvayana and Asvakayana of PƒÅ·πáini and Katyayana).

It is one of the oldest rug weaving centers and makes a huge diversity of types of carpets. The range starts at Bazaar quality of 24 raj (Number of knots per 7 cm of the widths of the rug) and on up to the incredibly fine 110 raj. Raj is the unit of knot density. It shows the rigidity of the rug which based on the number of strings used for the foundation of the rug. Strings materials are usually made of cotton or silk which is used for very fine rugs. Tabriz has one of the most diverse displays of designs from medallion, Herati/Mahi, to figural, pictorial, and even 3-d shaped rugs. The major producers in Tabriz today include: Alabaf of Tabriz, Galibafi Nassadji Tabriz, and Miri Brothers. Tabriz has been a large and worldwide famous carpet making center in the Iran and the world. It played a significant role in development the rich traditions of the decorative and applied arts. The art of Tabriz carpet was in its zenith in the 12th-16th centuries. About 200 Tabriz school masterpieces of the classical or \\"golden\\" period of the 14th century are characterized by a harmonic merge of the arts of miniature paintings and weaving, by a high level of craftsmanship demonstrated by artists and carpet weavers. The Tabriz school can be divided into 2 subgroups: Tabriz and Ardabil.  Ardabil carpets  \\" Ardabil\\", \\"Sheikh Safi\\", \\"Sarabi\\", \\"Shah Abbasi\\" and \\"Mir\\".  Tabriz carpets  \\"Tabriz\\", \\"Heris\\", \\"Lachak-turanj\\", \\"Afshan\\", \\"Agajaly\\", \\"Dord Fasil\\", \\"Sardorud\\". Tabriz Different types of carpets were made here, including pile and flat-weave, with simple and complex composition. The carpet making art was passed on from generation to generation and was considered the most valued heirloom. The traditional topics for the Tabriz carpets are the ornamental patterns, with the following dominant background colors: cream, red or navy blue. The most typical for this school are rugs and carpets grouped under the common name ‚ÄúLachak turanj‚Äù. In the middle of the center field and in the corners of the carpet (‚Äúlachak‚Äù)( triangle) there are ‚Äúturanj‚Äù( Citron). The turanj in the center of the carpet is a symbol of the Moon, and the pattern formed by lozenges with the toothed leaves on the edges symbolizes the scales of the fish, which rise to the surface of the water at midnight to admire the Moon reflection. The origin of this composition dates back to the 9th-10th centuries. Often the topics for the Tabriz carpets are drawn from the works of the great Oriental poets. The carpets often depict the scenes of falconry or images of a ferocious lion. Well known are also Tabriz carpet- pictures with images of fragments of palaces and mosques, scenes of battles. Often, in creation of this or that ornamental pattern carpet weavers were inspired by the hand-painted covers of ancient books. Heris The name of these carpets is associated with the village of Heris or Herez to the North East of Tabriz. The stylistic decoration of the ‚ÄúHeris‚Äù carpets is rather unusual. The composition and common shapes of the details are created on the basis of the composition ‚Äúlachak turanj‚Äù, which is formed by the foliate curve-linear patterns. However, with time the patterns of this composition became dotted and created an independent carpet pattern. Normally, the carpet was woven from memory, without a sketch. There is not surprising because since the beginning of the 16th century till the present day the craftsmen in Heris have traditionally been making only this type of carpet, and they know perfectly well its design and pattern. Note that the residents of Heris are also renowned for production of flat-weave rugs ‚Äì palases and kilims. Four seasons The ‚ÄúDord fasil‚Äù (‚ÄúFour Seasons‚Äù in Azerbaijani) is famous in Azerbaijan and other parts of Iran. The carpets of this type combine ancient elements of the decorative art, traditional symbolism dating back to the spiritual conceptions of the early farming age, and religious scenes. Each of the four parts of the carpet field is independent in terms of its composition. It depicts scenes of each season and represents the images of the peasants‚Äô way of life. Autumn pictures: harvesting, tillage and sowing. Winter images: the peasants sweep the snow off the roofs, whip up the loaded donkeys to the village, in the foreground there is a worker with a spade offering his services while the background depicts the masterpiece of the Azerbaijani architecture of the 15th century ‚Äì the ‚ÄúBlue Mosque‚Äù in Tabriz. The spring landscape is woven in vivid colors: trees in bloom, a shepherd with a flock of sheep, a girl listening to the sounds of his reed-pipe, and an old man with a tobacco pipe, talking to a peasant. The summertime picture: harvesting, women and children bind sheaves and take them off the field. The background shows a camelcade. Despite the independence of each of the scenes, they are unified in terms of composition and style. The illusion of space is achieved through the three-plane reproduction of the topic motifs. The dominating colors are of golden and red hues, which help to ensure a common rhythm. Trees or Tree of Life It is their composition that gave the name to these carpets rather than the place of production. In other parts of Iran, these carpets are widely known under the name of ‚ÄúDerakhti‚Äù, in Afghanistan ‚ÄúBagghi‚Äù and in Azerbaijan ‚ÄúAgajly‚Äù. The composition of the center field the ‚ÄúAgajly‚Äù carpet consists largely of one or several trees and bushes, in rare cases ‚Äì of a cluster of trees. The trees are of different appearance. In ancient times such compositions were based on some legendary events, love scenes, mythological and sometimes even religious and fanatical plots. The weeping willow was a symbol of love, the oak represented strength and courage, and the pomegranate personified abundance and luck. This type of design is used in Qum, Tabriz, Isfahan, Kashan Subject carpets While the carpets with abstract patterns obviously prevail, there were subject carpets as well. The most ancient of them is mentioned by Nizami, the outstanding Iranian poet of the 12th century, whose work served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration not only for numerous miniature painters but for the carpet art as well. One of the most ancient subject carpets was the Sasanid carpet called ‚ÄúZimistan‚Äù (Winter), which was taken by the Arabs as a trophy after the devastation of the Sasanid empire. Contrary to its name, this carpet is said to depict spring landscapes. It was called ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù because it was laid in the palace during wintertime and its vivid patterns brightened the winter interior with the luxuriant colors of the gardens and fields in bloom. Perhaps Khosrov Parviz, the Sasanid King, reminisced about spring when looking at this carpet in winter. Seasons constitute the most favorite carpet subjects. Normally, they form the background for the famous Oriental buildings, including forts, palaces, mosques, temples ‚Äì the Nature blossoms and withers but the stones remain intact‚Ä¶ Khosrau, Farhad, Shirin, BahrƒÅm G≈çr, Iskander, Layla and Majnun ‚Äì these characters created by Ferdosi, Nizami and Fizuli, as well as scenes from their poems are often depicted in the carpets, whose style reminds you of the miniatures by the painters of the celebrated Tabriz school flourishing at the time of the Safavids. The subject carpets were based on various topics, the most favorite being those of hunting and animals, literature plots and religious themes. One of the traditional subjects is the image of Omar Khayam with his sweetheart. By virtue of the specific language of the miniature painting the carpet composition conveys the spirit and essence of Khayam‚Äôs poetry, and it does it with a great realistic force. The carpet bears the distichs and quatrains ‚Äì verses and sections from the poems by Ferdosi, Saadi, Hafez, Sheikh Attar, with some sage maxims and adages about love.

Speedy in Oz (1934) is the twenty-eighth in the series of Oz books created by L. Frank Baum and his successors, and the fourteenth written by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was Illustrated by John R. Neill. This book features yet another island which floats in the sky: Umbrella Island, which flies by virtue of a huge umbrella with lifting and shielding powers. The king is not very good at steering the flying island; he bumps it into a giant's head. For compensation, Loxo, the great brute, demands the King's daughter Gureeda, whom he mistakes for a boy, as a servant to lace his huge boots. However, he grants the Umbrella Islanders three months to train the child to be a bootlacer. Meanwhile, the boy Speedy (from The Yellow Knight of Oz) returns for another adventure. While inspecting a dinosaur skeleton, Speedy is blown by a geyser into the air. The skeleton comes magically to life and becomes Terrybubble, a live dinosaur skeleton. Terrybubble and Speedy land on Umbrella Island. Speedy develops a friendship with Princess Gureeda. He also becomes friendly with the island's resident wizard, Waddy. An unscrupulous minister, however, notices that Speedy and Gureeeda look very much alike and could pass for fraternal twins.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 87, 200, 210. He hatches a plot to compensate the giant by handing Speedy over to him as a slave instead of Gureeda. Terrybubble learns of this plot, and he parachutes off the island with Speedy and Gureeda. All three are captured by Loxo, and it is up to the wizard Waddy to save them. Aside from a brief consultation with Princess Ozma and her advisers, the book deals exclusively with characters of Thompson's creation.

He rose to fame in the early 1990s after he was asked to tour the US with Phil Coulter. He soon established himself as a solo artist and found his greatest success singing traditional Irish music, both old and contemporary. Fleming has toured extensively throughout Ireland, UK, United States, the Netherlands and Australia.http://www.sundayworld.com/showbiz/brunker-meets.php?aid=1624 Biography From an early age Fleming's natural singing talent was on show in local talent competitions and concerts. He sang in public for the first time in 1978 at a concert put on by Kilmactigue National School, which he attended. After finishing secondary school in 1990, he played the local scene with a couple of bands, but it was his meeting with composer Phil Coulter in Westport, County Mayo, that changed his career. Within a few short months of this meeting, he appeared at the Cork Opera House, and the National Concert Hall in Dublin. He then went on a tour of the United States, which included appearances at Carnegie Hall and the Boston Symphony Hall. After his return to Ireland, he joined the group De Dannan. (Mary Black, Maura O'Connell, and Dolores Keane had been previous lead vocalists of this group.) He performed his first show with De Dannan in the Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow in January 1994. With De Dannan, Fleming's voice was brought to Australia, China, Hong Kong, and, once again, the United States.https://www.independent.ie/life/family/family-features/singer-tommy- fleming-lost-his-parents-on-the-same-day-it-was-heart-breaking-looking-at-two- coffins-in-the-church-34448532.html Career When Fleming was asked how he would describe his genre of music he confessed that it is not opera nor rock 'n' roll. He said that he is just \\"very traditional and likes a song with a good story\\". When he is touring, he is accompanied by David Hayes, who plays piano and keyboard. Hayes produces Fleming's albums and is the musical director of his shows. Fleming's first solo effort after leaving De Dannan, Different Side of Life, was released in 1996. In 1998, Fleming released Restless Spirit. In early 1998 while on the promotional tour for this album he was almost killed in a car accident returning to his native Sligo. He escaped from the burning car with a broken neck which put his career in jeopardy. He ended up wearing a cranial halo for three months. After this incident Fleming was told there was a chance he might not be able to walk again. The woman who rescued Fleming at the time was his wife Tina. Fleming said \\"She took over my management and helped steer me in the right direction\\". Sand & Water and The Contender were the two albums that followed Restless Spirit. The Contender brought Fleming back to the roots of traditional Irish music. The continued successes of his albums throughout 2000 and 2001 would lead to his first tour of Japan.Tommy Fleming biography, courtesy of his website, 2006 On 12 December 2004, Fleming recorded a concert at Knock Shrine Basilica in Knock, County Mayo. This building has a capacity of 5,000 and had been host to Holy Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II on his visit to Ireland in September 1979. Fleming's was the first concert of its kind to be held there. PBS began broadcasting the recording of the concert under the title Voice of Hope in the United States in August 2005. Voice Of Hope was his first album to be released in North America. In 2006, Fleming released his first studio album in three years, entitled A Life Like Mine. It included songs that Fleming had wanted to record for some time, including Jimmy MacCarthy's \\"Mystic Lipstick\\" and Phil Coulter's \\"Scorn Not His Simplicity\\". The album went straight to number 5 in the Album charts. In 2007, Fleming recorded his new live show, A Journey Home, at Ireland's National Events Centre in Killarney to an audience of 2,000. Released on CD and DVD in 2008, it features 22 songs from Ireland's most celebrated and acclaimed writers and poets. A Journey Home includes classical Irish songs such as \\"The Cliffs of Dooneen\\", \\"Isle of Innisfree\\" (the theme of the film, The Quiet Man, written by Dick Farrelly), and \\"Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears\\". Upon the release of A Journey Home, Fleming was asked in an interview what would be next for him. He stated that he's going to work on his next studio album, as well as writing an autobiography.http://femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity_interviews/fleming-54364.html He participated in season 4 of Celebrity Bainisteoir in 2011, managing St Patrick's GAA Club Dromard, Sligo.\\"RT√â's Celebrity Bainisteoirs announced\\".

History and structure The Al Thanis can be traced back to Mudar bin Nizar, who settled at Gebrin oasis in southern Najd (present-day Saudi Arabia) before he moved to Qatar. Around the 17th century, the tribe lived in Ushayqir, a settlement north-east of Riyadh. They settled in Qatar around the 1720s. Their first settlement in Qatar was in the southern town of Sikak, and from there they moved north-west to Zubarah and Al Ruwais.Mohamed Althani, p. 26 They settled in Doha in the 19th century under their leader Mohammed bin Thani. The group was named after the father of Mohammad, Thani bin Mohammad. The family is made of four main factions: Bani Qassim, Bani Ahmed, Bani Jaber, and Bani Thamer. As of the early 1990s, the number of the family members was estimated to be about _6,000._ The leadership transitions in 1913, 1949, 1960, and 2013 were all abdications.

Early life Born Emanuel Herrick in Perry Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio on September 20, 1876, he moved with his parents, John Emanuel Herrick and Belinda Kale Herrick, to Greenwood County, Kansas in 1877. Herrick was self-educated and engaged in agricultural pursuits. Later, he settled in the Cherokee Strip in Oklahoma Territory. In 1893, Herrick moved to Perry and became interested in agriculture and stock raising. Congressional career At the age of forty-two, Herrick was elected as a Republican to the Sixty-seventh Congress. Herrick won the Republican nomination after the popular incumbent Republican congressman, Dick T. Morgan, died unexpectedly on the last day of filing, allowing Herrick to take the nomination unopposed. Herrick was elected in November 1920 based on the strength of Warren G. Harding's showing in his district. Herrick served from March 4, 1921 to March 3, 1923. He unsuccessfully ran for reelection in 1922, losing in the Republican primary. As a Congressman, Herrick was one of the more colorful members of that body. During his one-and-only term, Herrick scandalized his fellow legislators by soliciting marriage proposals from beauty queens, only to claim that he was gathering information for intended legislation banning beauty pageants. Herrick took a similar approach to his 1925 arrest for moonshining, claiming to be an undercover agent for the Internal Revenue Service. Herrick was also notable for his prowess as a barnstorming aviator, and for claiming to be Jesus Christ reborn (his given name was Immanuel). His mental health was often in question and his eccentricities and lack of knowledge of the governmental process overshadowed his diligence for constituents. Later life and death After leaving Congress, Herrick moved to California in 1933. He would settle in Plumas County, California in 1937 and ran unsuccessfully for Congress several times while in California. Herrick mysteriously disappeared during a Sierra blizzard on January 11, 1952, while on a trip to his mining claim eight miles northeast of Quincy, California. A month later, Herrick was found dead in a snowbank two miles from his cabin on February 29, 1952. His remains were cremated and the ashes interred in Quincy Cemetery in Quincy.

United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that certain interim provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. BackgroundThe Gun Control Act of 1968= The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA), Pub. L 90-618 and subsequent amendments established a detailed Federal program governing the distribution of firearms. The GCA prohibited firearms ownership by certain broad categories of individuals thought to pose a threat to public safety: convicted felons, convicted misdemeanor domestic violence or stalking offenders, persons with an outstanding felony warrant, fugitives from justice, unlawful aliens, persons with court-mandated protective orders issued against them, persons who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, adjudicated mentally ill by a court, and others. Persons disqualified from firearms ownership for mental health reasons can apply to have this disability removed. States that do not maintain an application process to allow persons disqualified for mental health reasons to obtain relief from firearms prohibition face Justice Assistance Grant penalties. Section 105 of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA), cited as Pub. L. 110‚Äì180, ¬ß 105, provides for restoration of firearm ownership rights in mental health cases. Under NIAA it is up to each U.S. state to come up with its own application process; thus the procedure to regain one's rights vary from state-to-state. =The Brady Act= On November 30, 1993, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, Pub. L. 103‚Äì159, amending the 1968 Gun Control Act. This \\"Brady Bill\\" required the United States Attorney General to establish an electronic or phone-based background check to prevent firearms sales to persons already prohibited from owning firearms. This check, entitled the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), went into effect as required on November 30, 1998. =Interim provisions= The Act also immediately put in place certain interim provisions until that system became operative. Under the interim provisions, a firearms dealer who proposes to transfer a handgun must receive from the transferee a statement (the Brady Form), containing the name, address and date of the proposed transfer along with a sworn statement that the transferee is not among any of the classes of prohibited purchasers, verify the identity of the transferee by examining an identification document, and provide the \\"chief law enforcement officer\\" (CLEO) of the transferee's residence with notice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form. When a CLEO receives the required notice of a proposed transfer, they must \\"make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days whether receipt or possession would be in violation of the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available and in a national system designated by the Attorney General.\\" =The plaintiffs= Petitioners Sheriffs Jay Printz and Richard Mack, the Chief Law Enforcement Officers for Ravalli County, Montana, and Graham County, Arizona, represented by Stephen Halbrook and David T. Hardy respectively, filed separate actions challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act's interim provisions. They objected to the use of congressional action to compel state officers to execute Federal law. =Lower court decisions= On May 16, 1994, United States District Judge Charles C. Lovell granted the Sheriff declaratory judgment, finding that the provision requiring CLEOs to perform background checks violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also concluding that provision was severable from the remainder of the Act, effectively leaving a voluntary background check system in place.Printz v. United States, 854 F. Supp. 1503 (D. Mont. 1994). On June 29, 1994, United States District Judge John Roll reached the same conclusion.Mack v. United States, 856 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Ariz. 1994). Those judgments were reversed on September 8, 1995, by United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Judge William C. Canby Jr., joined by Judge Herbert Choy, over the dissent of Judge Ferdinand Francis Fernandez.Mack v. United States, 66 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir. 1995). The Second Circuit also rejected a sheriff's challenge to the mandate,Frank v. United States, 78 F3d 815, 830 (2d Cir. 1996), vacated, 1I7 S. Ct. 2501 (1997) (mem.) but the Fifth Circuit found that the mandate was unconstitutional,Koog v. United States, 79 F.3d 452, 462 (sth Cir. i996) creating a circuit split.The Supreme Court, 1996 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 207 (1997). Supreme Court The Montana and Arizona Sheriffs‚Äô petition for a writ of certiorari was granted and one-hour of oral arguments were heard on December 3, 1996, where Hallbrook appeared for the sheriffs and Walter E. Dellinger III, the acting Solicitor General of the United States, appeared for the Government. =Opinion of the Court= On June 27, 1997, the last day of the term, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist alongside Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas found that the Brady Act's attempted commandeering of the sheriffs to perform background checks violated the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his opinion of the Court, Justice Scalia stated that, although there is no constitutional text precisely responding to the challenge, an answer can be found ‚Äúin historical understanding and practice, the structure of the Constitution, and in the jurisprudence of this Court.‚Äù Historical understanding and practice Founding era Acts of Congress imposing obligations on state judges are not evidence of federal power over state officials because, according to the Court, the Madisonian Compromise had agreed to leave the creation of lower federal courts optional.Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 907 (1997) citing C. Warren, The Making of the Constitution 325‚Äì327 (1928). The Court rejected the Government's argument that Federalist No. 36, Federalist No. 45, and Federalist No. 27 anticipated that Congress would \\"make use\\" of state officials.Printz at 910. Rather, the Court viewed ‚Äúalmost two centuries of apparent congressional avoidance of the practice‚Äù as strong evidence that Congressmen did not think they had the power to command state officials. The structure of the Constitution The Court explained that federalism in the United States is based upon \\"dual sovereignty\\", quoting Federalist No. 39's assurance that states retain \\"a residual and inviolable sovereignty\\". The Court stated that the Framers designed the Constitution to allow Federal regulation of international and interstate matters, not internal matters reserved to the State Legislatures. The Court expressed a worry that Members of Congress might take credit for \\"solving\\" a problem with policies that impose all the financial and administrative burden, as well as the blame, on local officials.Printz at 930 citing Merritt, Three Faces of Federalism: Finding a Formula for the Future, 47 Vand. L. Rev. 1563, 1580, n. 65 (1994). The Court quoted Federalist No. 51‚Äôs argument that by giving voters control over dual sovereign governments \\"a double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself.\\"Printz at 922 citing The Federalist No. 51, at 323.http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed51.asp The Court concluded that allowing the Federal government to draft the police officers of the 50 states into its service would increase its powers far beyond what the Constitution intends. The Court identified an additional structural problem with commandeering the Sheriffs: it violated the constitutional separation of powers by robbing the President of the United States of his power to execute the laws; contradicting the \\"unitary executive theory\\". The Court explained :We have thus far discussed the effect that federal control of state officers would have upon the first element of the \\"double security\\" alluded to by Madison: the division of power between State and Federal Governments. It would also have an effect upon the second element: the separation and equilibration of powers between the three branches of the Federal Government itself. The Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, \\"shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\\" Art. II, ¬ß3, personally and through officers whom he appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress may authorize to be appointed by the \\"Courts of Law\\" or by \\"the Heads of Departments\\" who with other presidential appointees), Art. II, ¬ß2. The Brady Act effectively transfers this responsibility to thousands of CLEOs in the 50 States, who are left to implement the program without meaningful Presidential control (if indeed meaningful Presidential control is possible without the power to appoint and remove). The insistence of the Framers upon unity in the Federal Executive--to insure both vigor and accountability--is well known. See The Federalist No. 70 (A. Hamilton); 2 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 495 (M. Jensen ed. 1976) (statement of James Wilson); see also Calabresi & Prakash, The President's Power to Execute the Laws, 104 Yale L. J. 541 (1994). That unity would be shattered, and the power of the President would be subject to reduction, if Congress could act as effectively without the President as with him, by simply requiring state officers to execute its laws Finally, the Court applied its past jurisprudence. The Government had argued that the anti-commandeering doctrine established in New York v. United States (1992), which held that Congress could not command state legislatures to either pass a law or take ownership of nuclear waste, did not apply to state officials. Rejecting the Government's argument, the Court held that the Tenth Amendment categorically forbids the Federal Government from commanding state officials directly. As such, the Brady Act's mandate on the Sheriffs to perform background checks was unconstitutional. Justice O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion, alone, highlighting that the Court's holding left local Chief Law Enforcement Officers free to voluntarily comply with the federal mandate. Justice Thomas also added a concurrence, alone, clarifying that, in his opinion, Congress's interstate Commerce Clause powers do not apply to purely intrastate firearms transfers. Thomas went on to encourage the Court to someday consider the ‚Äúcolorable argument‚Äù that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution grants individuals a personal right to own firearms. =Dissents= Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer, respectfully dissented. Justice Stevens suggested the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, giving the Federal government the right to regulate handgun sales, can be coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause, giving Congress the power to pass whatever laws are necessary and proper to carry out its previously enumerated power. The Tenth Amendment, Stevens explained, contains no additional limitations on federal power, serving merely to clarify that the Government has only those powers granted by the Constitution. Stevens extolled the benefits of cooperative federalism. Federal direction of state officials in this manner is analogous to ordering the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic, or directing state officials to respond to a terrorist threat. He was very concerned with the ability of the federal government to respond to a national emergency and did not believe that \\"there is anything in the 10th amendment 'in historical understanding and practice, in the structure of the Constitution, or in the jurisprudence of this Court,' that forbids the enlistment of state officers to make that response effective.\\" Moreover, the text of the Constitution does not support the Majority's apparent proposition that \\"a local police officer can ignore a command contained in a statute enacted by Congress pursuant to an express delegation of power enumerated in Article I.\\" Justice Souter filed a dissenting opinion alone, emphasizing that he read Federalist No. 27 as providing ample evidence that the Framers‚Äô original intent was to require states to act as auxiliaries of the Federal government. Justice Breyer filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Stevens, using international comparative law to observe that the federalism found in many foreign countries gives the central government some authority over sub-national jurisdictions. Subsequent developments The immediate effects of the ruling on the Brady Bill were negligible. The vast majority of local and state law enforcement officials supported the interim provisions and were happy to comply with the background checks. The issue ended with the completion of the federal background check database. However, Printz v. United States was an important ruling in support of States' rights and the New Federalism. Professor Ann Althouse has suggested that Printz applies to the U.S. government response to the September 11 attacks because \\"state and local government autonomy can exert pressure on the federal government to moderate its efforts and take care not to offend constitutional rights.\\"Althouse, The Vigor of the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine in Times of Terror, 69 Brook. L. Rev. 1231 (2004). In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court adopted the suggestion from Justice Thomas's concurrence that the Constitution grants individuals a personal right to own firearms. U.S. District Judge John Roll, who had originally declared the Brady Act unconstitutional, was shot and killed in the 2011 Tucson shooting, the same mass shooting where Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot in the head.

Harbour description The Mi'kmaq First Nation, long the occupants of this territory, called the harbour Jipugtug in their language. It was transliterated in English as \\"Chebucto\\". It runs in a northwest-southeast direction. Based on average vessel speeds, the harbour is strategically located approximately one hour's sailing time north of the Great Circle Route between the Eastern Seaboard and Europe. As such, it is the first inbound and last outbound port of call in eastern North America with transcontinental rail connections. The harbour is largely formed by a drowned glacial valley which succumbed to sea level rise since glaciation. The Sackville River now empties into the upper end of the harbour in Bedford Basin; however, its original river bed has been charted by the Canadian Hydrographic Service throughout the length of the harbour and beyond. The harbour includes the following geographic areas: * Northwest Arm: Another drowned river valley now used largely by pleasure boats. * The Narrows: A constricted passage to Bedford Basin. * Bedford Basin: A sheltered bay and the largest part of the harbour. =Islands= The harbour is home to several small islands. The harbour limit is formed by the northern end of its largest island - McNabs Island. The largest island entirely within the harbour limits is Georges Island, a glacial drumlin similar to its dryland counterpart at Citadel Hill. Several small islands are located in the Bedford Basin near Bedford and Burnside. In the Northwest Arm is a small peninsula known as Deadman's Island, named for being the burial location of War of 1812 prisoners of war.Deadman's Island. Ns1763.ca. Retrieved on 2013-07-23. Just 200 m west of Deadman's Island is the equally small Melville Island, which is connected to the mainland by road. Melville Island forms the eastern boundary of Melville Cove and is also the location of the Armdale Yacht Club. An adjacent residential community named itself after the cove. Although outside the defined harbour limits, Lawlor Island and Devils Island are also frequently included in descriptions of Halifax Harbour and the surrounding area. Navigation Halifax's official harbour limit for navigational purposes is delineated by a line running from Herring Cove on the west side of the main channel, to the northern end of McNabs Island, then from McNabs Island across the Eastern Passage to the actual community of Eastern Passage on the east side of the island. The harbour is marked by an extensive network of buoys and lighthouses, starting with Sambro Island Lighthouse at the harbour approaches, the oldest operating lighthouse in North America. Deep draught vessels must use the main channel into the harbour, which runs on the west side of McNabs Island. The west entrance point marking the beginning of the inner approach using this channel is located near Chebucto Head, approximately south of the limit. Shallow draught vessels (less than ) may use the Eastern Passage, which runs on the east side of McNabs Island; however, continuous silting makes charted depths unreliable. Large vessels have compulsory pilotage, with harbour pilots boarding at the pilot station off Chebucto Head. Vessels wishing to transit The Narrows between the outer harbour and Bedford Basin must travel one at a time; this rule was established after the disastrous Halifax Explosion of December 6, 1917 when a collision between the French munitions ship and the Norwegian ship destroyed part of Halifax and Dartmouth. The Royal Canadian Navy maintains a large base housing Maritime Forces Atlantic along the western side of The Narrows, as well as an ammunition depot on the northeastern shore of Bedford Basin, CFAD Bedford. There are strict security regulations relating to vessels navigating near Navy facilities and anchorages. There are two large suspension bridges crossing The Narrows: * the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge, opened in 1955 * the A. Murray MacKay Bridge, opened in 1970 Port facilities Halifax Harbour from the air looking South. Bedford is seen in the foreground, the Halifax Peninsula on the right, and Dartmouth on the left. After Confederation in 1867, boosters of Halifax expected federal help to make the city's natural harbor Canada's official winter port and a gateway for trade with Europe. Halifax's advantages included its location just off the Great Circle route made it the closest to Europe of any mainland North American port. But the new Intercolonial Railway (ICR) took an indirect, southerly route for military and political reasons, and the national government made little effort to promote Halifax as Canada's winter port. Ignoring appeals to nationalism and the ICR's own attempts to promote traffic to Halifax, most Canadian exporters sent their wares by train though Boston or Portland. Harbour promoters fought an uphill battle to finance the large-scale port facilities Halifax lacked, succeeding just before the First World War with the start of construction of the large docking facilities at Ocean Terminals in Halifax's South End. The war at last boosted Halifax's harbor into prominence on the North Atlantic.James D. Frost, \\"Halifax: the Wharf of the Dominion, 1867-1914.\\" Journal of the Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society 2005 8: 35-48. The Halifax Port Authority is a federally appointed agency which administers and operates various port properties on the harbour. Previously run by the National Harbours Board, the HPA is now a locally run organization. HPA facilities include: * South End Container Terminal - Piers 36-42 (currently operated by Halterm Limited, with several gantry and post- Panamax cranes) * Halifax Grain Elevator * Ocean Terminals - Piers 23-34 * Piers 20 -22: Pier 20, Halifax Seaport Farmers Market, The Cruise Ship Pavilion and Pier 21 Museum * Richmond Terminals - Piers 9 and 9A * Richmond Offshore Terminals - Piers 9B-9D (multi-user supply base for offshore oil and gas exploration/production) * Fairview Cove Container Terminal - (currently operated by Cerescorp) * National Gypsum Wharf - (currently operated by National Gypsum to serve Wrights Cove gypsum terminal) * Woodside Atlantic Wharf - (vessel lay-up and repair, oil platform servicing) * Imperial Oil Wharves - (currently operated by Imperial Oil to serve Dartmouth refinery) * Ultramar Oil Wharves - (currently operated by Ultramar to serve the petroleum storage facility) * Eastern Passage Autoport - (currently operated by CN) All HPA facilities are serviced by CN. It provides on-dock daily train service to Montreal, Toronto, Detroit and Chicago. The railway also operates the Halifax Intermodal Terminal (HIT) adjacent to the Richmond Terminals. In addition to HPA facilities, the following users have port facilities: * The Halifax Shipyard, operated by Irving Shipbuilding, a medium-sized vessel construction and repair yard operates on the north end of the Halifax side of the harbour. The yard contains a graving dock and various shore-based operations. * Until 2003 a marine railway called the Dartmouth Marine Slips operated in Dartmouth Cove until replaced by high rise residential development. * MARLANT operates the HMC Dockyard, Dockyard Annex, CFAD Bedford, and York Redoubt through CFB Halifax. There are also military docking facilities located adjacent to the Shearwater Heliport. * Canadian Coast Guard operated CCG Base Dartmouth, housing part of the Atlantic and Arctic fleets as well as pollution response and navigation aids maintenance facilities, until it was closed by 2012. All operations and vessels were shifted to BIO further North in the Harbour. The old base was transferred to the Provincial Government and is now operated as the COVE. * Bedford Institute of Oceanography maintains docking facilities for various government scientific vessels. Shannon Hill, above the BIO campus is also home to CCG's \\"Halifax Marine Communications and Traffic Services\\" which operates Halifax Coast Guard Radio and the Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) centre (\\"Halifax Traffic\\"), providing continuous radar coverage of all harbour activity. * There are several marinas on the harbour: ** Armdale Yacht Club (Northwest Arm) ** Bedford Basin Yacht Club (Bedford) ** Dartmouth Yacht Club (Wrights Cove)- Burnside ** Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron (Northwest Arm) ** Shearwater Yacht Club (Shearwater) ** St. Mary's Boat Club (Northwest Arm) ** Waegwoltic Club (Northwest Arm) * There are 2 Automated Weather stations within the harbour ** McNabs Island ** Weather buoy Station 44258 Pollution Fog creeping into the Halifax Harbour on a sunny day. Halifax Harbour has long been polluted as a result of two centuries of direct raw sewage discharge into its waters. The harbour's deep water, tidal dispersal of surface wastes and a relatively small population of the city of Halifax resulted in the harbour's presenting few health concerns until the late 20th century when sewage build-up caused the shut-down of all harbour beaches. The Harbour Solutions project, initiated in the year 2000, was the culmination of three decades of discussion and planning regarding how the urban area would solve the expensive problem of sewage treatment and disposal. The $400 million project was expected to be completed in late 2008 when the final of three new treatment plants was opened. Testing of harbour waters in July 2008, with two of the three sewage treatment plants on-line, indicated that they are safe for swimming. Municipal public beaches at Black Rock Beach in Point Pleasant Park and at the Dingle Beach in Sir Sandford Fleming Park were officially re-opened on Saturday, August 2, 2008 (Natal Day weekend) after a 30-year closure due to sewage contamination in the water. Lifeguards are now providing supervision during regular hours through to Labour Day weekend. However repeated breakdowns in the new system have resulted in swimming bans being regularly re-imposed and periodic resumption of raw sewage discharge. From early 2009 on swimming was no longer allowed in the harbour because the plant flooded and stopped working. On the weekend of July 4, 2010 some beaches (like Black Rock Beach) reopened. Shipwrecks Halifax Explosion blast cloud Halifax Harbour is noted for many shipwrecks both in the inner and outer harbour. A few ships were sunk at the edge of the harbour approaches during World War II by German U-boats but the vast majority were claimed by harbour accidents. Mapping of the harbour revealed about 45 shipwrecks in the harbour. Near the mouth of the harbour, over 50 magnetic anomalies have been discovered, most of which also represent shipwrecks with many others buried underneath the muddy sediments. All historic shipwrecks in Halifax Harbour are protected by Nova Scotia's Special Places Act which makes it illegal to remove artifacts without a permit.

On the second sonata, Schjelderup remarked: it is \\"the gift to the world of a man who has also shivered in the cold mists of night.\\" Also, due to the sonata's tragic qualities, he considered the piece more Norwegian than the first sonata and \\"a Norway without tragedy is not a complete Norway.\\" Finck. 195. When Grieg presented the sonata to his teacher Niels Gade, he proclaimed the work \\"too Norwegian\\" and professed that his next sonata should be less Norwegian. Grieg, reportedly, in defiance claimed that his next sonata would be even more Norwegian. = First movement = ew Dynamics { s2\\\\p } ew Staff = \\"down\\" { \\\\relative c' { \\\\key g \\\\minor \\\\time 2/4 \\\\clef bass \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"acoustic grand\\" \\\\stemDown 4--( q8-- q--)  8\\\\arpeggio r r4 4 q  q2 }} ew Dynamics { s2 s16\\\\sustainOn s4..\\\\sustainOff s2\\\\sustainOn s\\\\sustainOff } >> ;1st theme (G major) : \\\\relative c { \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"violin\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo \\"(Allegro vivace)\\" 4 = 178 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #67 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\override Score.SpacingSpanner #'common- shortest-duration = #(ly:make-moment 1 9) \\\\override TupletBracket #'stencil = ##f \\\\override TupletNumber #'Y-offset = #4.5 \\\\times 2/3 { g8(\\\\f a c) } b4.( a8)  \\\\times 2/3 { g( a fis) } d4.( fis8)  g[ r16 a( b8) r16 a( g8) r16 b](  d8[) r16 b]( a2)  } ;2nd theme (B minor) : \\\\relative c' ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"violin\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 144 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #88 \\\\bar \\"\\" r4 r fis_\\\\markup { \\\\dynamic p \\\\italic { \\"tranquillo ed espress.\\" } }  b2( cis4)  ais2( fis4)  b4.( d8\\\\< cis4)  ais2( fis4)  b4.( d8 cis4)  ais( fis ais)  a!2.(  fis'4)\\\\\\\\! r } ;3rd theme (D major) : \\\\relative c ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"violin\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 178 \\\\set Score.currentBarNumber = #135 \\\\bar \\"\\" \\\\override Score.SpacingSpanner #'common-shortest-duration = #(ly:make-moment 1 9) d8-.[\\\\pp^\\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"a tempo\\" } r16 e%?

Whereas the first two sonatas were written in a matter of weeks, this sonata took him several months to complete.Chris Woodstra, et al. All music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music. (San Francisco, CA: Backbeat Books, 2005). 531. The sonata remains the most popular of the three works, and has established itself in the standard repertoire. The work was also a personal favorite of Grieg's. The sonata premiered with Grieg himself at the piano with well-known violinist Adolph Brodsky in Leipzig. To a certain extent, Grieg built on Norwegian folk melodies and rhythms in this three-movement sonata. However, Grieg considered the second sonata as the \\"Norwegian\\" sonata, while the third sonata was \\"the one with the broader horizon.\\"Oelmann, Klaus Henning (1993): Edvard Grieg - Versuch einer Orientierung. Egelsbach K√∂ln New York: Verlag H√§nsel-Hohenhausen 1993, pp. 117, 366-373 This was the last piece Grieg composed using sonata form.Finck. 238. The sole notable exception is perhaps his String Quartet No. 2 in F major, EG 117 (1891), whose first two movements Grieg more or less finished in 1891 (and whose second pair he returned to in 1906 in another failed attempt. His friend Julius R√∂ntgen prepared an edition for Peters of the two movements Grieg finished, after Grieg's death, which were premiered at his home in November 1907 and published by Peters in 1908 (http://www.griegsociety.org/default.asp?kat=1022&id;=4767&sp;=2 ).) = First movement = The first movement is characterized by its bold and heroic introduction. The agitated opening theme is contrasted with a lyrical second theme. = Second movement = The second movement opens with a serene piano solo in E major with a lyrical melodic line. In the middle section, Grieg uses a playful dance tune. The second movement exists also in a version for cello and piano that Grieg composed during the same time as the violin version. The cello version was given to his brother as a birthday gift in May 1887, but appeared in print only in 2005 (by Henle). = Third movement = The finale is written in sonata form with coda but lacks a development section.

They are especially active in the King Country, ≈åp≈çtiki, Waikato and Hastings.\\"Police say Mongrel Mob still criminals\\". Daily Post, 14 December 2006. The Mongrel Mob's main rival is the Black Power gang; there have been several very public and violent clashes between the two gangs over the years. History The gang began with a group of mainly European youths from Wellington and Hawke's Bay in the 1960s. Legend within the gang holds that the name originated from the comments of a judge in the Hastings District Court, who referred to a group of men before him as \\"mongrels\\".\\"Chapter 3\\", Jarrod, Patched: The History of Gangs in New Zealand Whatever the origin, the group embraced the term. By the late 1960s loose groups of rebellious young men in Wellington and Hawke's Bay were calling themselves Mongrels. By 1966 they were wearing patches bearing the name 'Mongrel Mob'. By about 1970 the Mongrels were also known as the Mongrel Mob, and the gang had expanded to include numerous MƒÅori. Members consider Hastings in Hawke's Bay to be the gang's \\"Fatherland\\" or birthplace, and the gang first became known for its violence in Hawke's Bay. Later, similarly named groups sprang up around the country, forming their own independent chapters. In the 2000s and 2010s, the Mongrel Mob began expanding into parts of Australia. In 2018 they also expanded into Canada. =Chapters= According to Te Ara, in 2010 there were over 30 recognised chapters of the Mongrel Mob; including, *Mongrel Mob Hastings ‚Äì 1962 *Mongrel Mob Wellington ‚Äì 1962 *Mongrel Mob Auckland Maximum Security Prison ‚Äì 1979 *Notorious Mongrel Mob ‚Äì 1981 *Mongrel Mob Melbourne ‚Äì 2013 *Mongrel Mob Darwin ‚Äì 2016 *Mongrel Mob Gold Coast ‚Äì 2016 *Mongrel Mob Fatherland ‚Äì 2018 *Mongrel Mob Te Puke Insignia Mongrel Mob colours are predominantly red and black. The patches usually feature a British Bulldog wearing a German Stahlhelm, which supposedly is an image intended to offend as it is a British Bulldog wearing the helmet. The patch is worn on the back of \\"patched members\\": those considered 'loyal' and 'trustworthy' enough to be in the gang. The patch will also be tattooed on the member's body. Mob members are known for their tattooed faces and red bandannas. Membership The gang claims it offers a surrogate 'family' for young men, most of whom are often alienated from their family via joining. A majority of members are from New Zealand's MƒÅori, European or other Polynesian ethnic groups, with MƒÅori or part MƒÅori predominating. A \\"prospect\\" is a person who is loyal to the gang but is not a \\"patched member\\" yet and must normally do errands or \\"missions\\" to show his loyalty to his gang. A \\"prospect\\" normally has a \\"patched member\\" to report or \\"clock in\\" to. This \\"patched member\\" normally decides when it is time for the \\"prospect\\" to be \\"patched\\". The hierarchy is: captain or president, vice president, sergeant at arms, patched members, prospects. In some cases they use younger blood gangs as prospects. There were 934 members in prison in April 2013, making up more than a tenth of all New Zealand prisoners. In the Wellington region, there were an estimated 194 \\"patched members\\" in 2013. =Notable members= *Anaru \\"Fats\\" Moke ‚Äì Wellington member, often featured in the media *Dennis Makalio ‚Äì Senior member, often featured in New Zealand media *Frank Milosevic ‚Äì President of the Mongrel Mob Kawerau *Joe Edmonds ‚Äì Senior member, deported from Australia while attempting to establish a chapter *Roy Dunn ‚Äì Mongrel Mob President who died on 1 April 2016 *Tuhoe Isaac ‚Äì Former senior member often featured in the media *Sonny Fatupaito ‚Äì President of the reformist Mongrel Mob Kingdom chapter in the Waikato Criminal activityOrganised crime= *Operation Crusade In 2001, the New Zealand Police launched Operation Crusade, a long police surveillance operation of the Christchurch-based Mongrel Mob Aotearoa chapter. The main purpose of the Operation was to disrupt and destroy a suspected drug sales-ring controlled by the Mongrel Mob. Over a 15-month period, the Operation targeted the gang using taps on the phones of known Mongrel Mob Aotearoa members and undercover police buying drugs from the gang. The operation culminated in co-ordinated raids resulting in nearly 40 arrests and a \\"huge trial\\" in the High Court at Christchurch. Joseph 'Junior' Wiringi and most of the chapter's top hierarchy were arrested in 2003 as part of the police investigation on more than 70 charges, including dealing in methamphetamine and magic mushrooms and possessing firearms. The operation confirmed the suspicions of police and revealed brazen drug dealing from the gang's former headquarters on Wilsons Rd. *Operation Walnut Operation Walnut was a four-month long investigation targeting an organised methamphetamine supply-and-distribution ring operating out of the Mongrel Mob Porirua in the Wellington region. The investigation began in December 2016 when New Zealand Police officers infiltrated the Mongrel Mob via placing undercover officers as associates of the organisation, where they would buy methamphetamine from the gang. As well as undertaking 8 search warrants in the Wellington region, the Operation also targeted a property in the East Auckland suburb of Howick where the Mongrel Mob is suspected of importing the methamphetamine. The operation involved another 150 New Zealand Police officers, with 120 operating in the Wellington raids and the remaining 30 operating in the Auckland raids. From December 2016 to April 2017, it is thought that the Mongrel Mob had distributed over 20 kilograms of methamphetamine, valued at over $18 million. The first day of raids led to the confiscation of a Mercedes-Benz, a container property, 2 kilograms of methamphetamine, $450,000 in cash, two stolen motorbikes valued at $30,000, and over 13 vehicles, a jetski, 2 boats, valued at $1.8 million. The second day of the raids led to 7 arrests, as well as grenades, money, 2 kilograms of methamphetamine, locked safes, and 11 guns being found and confiscated. The Operation culminated in 14 arrests; 4 kilograms of methamphetamine, valued at $3.6 million; $2.3 million in property; and $500,000 in cash being confiscated. *Operation Notus Confiscated firearms positioned on a confiscated motorcycle In October 2017, Operation Notus was launched because of community concern in regards to the Mongrel Mob Kawerau and their alleged involvement in the 'commercial distribution of methamphetamine and cannabis' within the community. The six-month-long investigation involved over 300 New Zealand Police staff, including the Auckland-based National Organised Crime Group, Tauranga-based Armed Offenders Squads, and the locally based Asset Recovery Unit. The investigation proved the community concern to be accurate, and led to the arrests of over 30 members, and associates, of the Mongrel Mob Kawerau. The final number of arrested associates stood at 38 arrested, with more arrests likely to occur The investigation culminated with the raids of over 40 properties, in Kawerau, ≈åp≈çtiki, Whakatane; and 3 properties in Gisborne and Hastings; leading to the subsequent arrest of the 30 associates. Along with the arrests, the police confiscated over 25 firearms, over $2.6 million worth of methamphetamine, over $100,000 in bank accounts as well as over 100 cannabis plants. Also confiscated were residential property, boats, jet-skis, motorcycles, and cars. Eastern Bay of Plenty Area Commander Inspector Kevin Taylor said, \\"We are committed to protecting our communities from the harm caused by organised crime and today's arrests will go a long way to disrupting the supply of methamphetamine and cannabis in Kawerau and wider Bay of Plenty region.\\" Kawerau is commonly known as a 'red-town', a town that is known to be a Mongrel Mob stronghold. = Other incidents= *In June 1971, members of the Hells Angels, Highway 61, the Polynesian Panthers and the Mongrel Mob gangs engaged in a large gang-related brawl in central Auckland. *On 14 August 1981, Mongrel Mob Wellington leader Lester Epps awoke outside the gang pad. Epps had fought members of the Eastern Suburbs Rugby League Club at the Tramway Hotel the night before. Epps tried to flee through the Basin Reserve, however he was ultimately caught and beaten. He died later in hospital. All people involved eventually received 18-month prison terms for manslaughter. *In June 1987, Mongrel Mob member Sam Te Hei raped and murdered 16-year-old Colleen Burrows in Napier. *In 1988, a young woman was kidnapped by the Mongrel Mob and taken to a convention in Auckland, where she was subsequently raped by over 15 members of the gang. *In 2003, members of the Murupara Mongrel Mob, and the Tribesmen MC Murupara chapters were involved in multiple methamphetamine laboratories that were raided by police. *On 9 September 2011, a member of the Wairoa Mongrel Mob chapter fired a sawn-off shotgun at a local Rugby League match because there were Black Power gang members in attendance. *In August 2016, a 31-year-old with Mongrel Mob Aotearoa links and under the influence of methamphetamine and alcohol caused a crash with a taxi in Christchurch, injuring two people. *According to the Northern Territory News, between the establishment of the Mongrel Mob Darwin in September 2016 and January 2017, there were roughly four unreported assaults involving Mongrel Mob members, including a brawl with a member of the Australian Hells Angels. *On 13 January 2018, a gunfight erupted in Whakatane, Bay of Plenty, when a funeral procession of the Mongrel Mob Kawerau chapter was ambushed by members of the Outback Blacks ‚Äì a sub-chapter of Black Power. *On 10 March 2018, Joe Edmonds, a senior Mongrel Mob member, was deported from Australia, along with four others, for allegedly attempting to establish a Mongrel Mob chapter in Western Australia. *On 22 March 2018, police raided four houses in ≈åp≈çtiki, leading to three Mongrel Mob Barbarians members being arrested and charged with a connection to the supply of methamphetamine in Opotiki. Community services In 2005, the Mongrel Mob Notorious chapter and its President Roy Dunn started a labour-hire business to do painting, demolition, and other work. Dunn said, \\"We are setting this up for our kids, creating the employment, bringing them in.\\" A search on the New Zealand Companies Office showed that Dunn was a joint-shareholder in two companies, both named Rent A Bro Limited at one point, however the older company's name was changed to BRO 2007 Limited in 2011, just months before the second company was incorporated. BRO 2007 was incorporated in 2007 as Rent A Bro Limited and changed its name to BRO 2007 Limited in 2011 and subsequently removed from the company registry in 2012. Rent A Bro Limited was incorporated in 2011 and was removed from the company registry in 2013. In 2010, Dunn and his Mangere-based Notorious chapter announced the Hauora Programme partnership with the Salvation Army to combat methamphetamine drug use. By 2013, they had completed five intakes of 'P' users who wanted to rid themselves of addiction. In a press release via The Salvation Army, Dunn stated, \\"When our whanau arrive at rehab, we discover how some of them have been living‚Äîand the effects of this on their kids. Many onlookers could say that we do things to excess, and maybe that is true. Our journey so far has been about learning. We still do and get things wrong because we don‚Äôt necessarily know how to do things differently. I ask my leaders all the time to consider changing what they know for a different way. I haven‚Äôt always had total acceptance of this journey. It continues to be one step at a time... ...As our rehabs have progressed‚Äîwe have just had our fifth rehab programme‚ÄîI ask myself, has this journey been worth it? I guess my answer is that every time I bury another one of my bros, my gut turns, and so I keep going on this journey. I remind myself of where we have come from and our vision to see our children free. Our vision to know and understand values that see us embrace that which we are good at: being whanau, looking out for each other, and having a good future for our kids.\\" In media *Ross Kemp on Gangs (2005) ‚Äì Season 1, Episode 3 ‚Äì Episode documenting the history of the Mongrel Mob in New Zealand. *Jono Rotman (2007) ‚Äì a photographer; has featured members of the Mongrel Mob gang in a series of award-winning, traditional portraits.

His secular surname may have been Qian (). It is possible that Huaisu was a nephew of the poet Qian Qi (). He became a monk in his childhood, apparently out of poverty. Legend has it that he planted banana trees (or any genus of trees under Musaceae) in the courtyard of the temple he lived, and used the leaves as paper to practice his art.His contemporary Lu Yu wrote in his Life of the monk Huaisu (ÂÉßÊá∑Á¥†ÂÇ≥): \\"He was broke and had no paper for writing.

Originally there were two presumably identical carpets, and the London carpet, as restored and reconstructed in the 19th century, uses sections from both. It now measures 34‚Äô 6\\" by 17‚Äô 6\\" (10.51 m by 5.35 m). The other carpet, now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and smaller at 283 x 157 1/2 in. (718.82 x 400.05 cm), was made up of the sections in adequate condition unused for the London carpet. Both carpets are now smaller (shorter in particular) than they would have been originally, and there are other fragments in various collections that appear to come from the reconstruction process. The carpets have a typical Tabriz design, with one central medallion and smaller, ornate designs surrounding. Such medallions and shapes were central to the design and reality of Persian gardens, a common symbol of paradise for followers of Islam. A cartouche on the London carpet contains the date A.H. 946, or 1539-40, which is thought to be the earliest date on any Persian carpet.  Design  The foundation is silk with wool pile of a knot density at 300‚Äì350 knots per square inch (47‚Äì54 knots per cm2). The size of the London carpet is , which gives it about 26 million knots in total. The carpets have an inscription: a couplet from a ghazal by Persian mythic poet Hafiz Shirazi and a signature. The inscription reads: > I have no refuge in the world other than thy threshold. > There is no protection for my head other than this door. > The work of the servant of the threshold Maqsud of Kashan in the year 946. Translating this date into the Christian calendar shows that the carpet was woven around the years 1539‚Äì40 during the reign of Shah Tahmasp, one of the great patrons of carpet weaving.

The design of the central medallion resembles that of the interior side of the dome of the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan, with two differently sized lamp motifs surrounding the design, now seen as a deliberate use of graphical perspective, when looked at from the end with the smaller lamp the two appear the same size. However, a debate exists due to the fact that there is no proof that graphical perspective was used in 1530s Iran and other historians and critics instead believe the lamps are ones found in mosques or shrines at the time. The border is created from cartouches filled with decorations and calligraphy, adding even more details to the already accomplished style. Designs for prestige carpet commissions were supplied by the court atelier of artists, who also designed for manuscripts, tiling patterns on buildings and other media, giving a uniform style to elite Safavid art. The designs were then copied and adapted for smaller carpets for a wider market. The design of these carpets are not typical of later Ardabil rugs, but products of the finest Safavid weaving, with influence from manuscript painting.

According to the traditional story, now rather doubted by historians, when new they were placed in the Sheikh Safi al-Din KhƒÅnegƒÅh and Shrine Ensemble in Ardabil, but became heavily worn and were sold in 1890 to a British carpet dealer who restored one of the carpets using the other and then resold the restored one to the Victoria and Albert Museum.; . Many specialists are now dubious that the carpets were made for Ardabil; apart from anything else, they would not fit in the shrine there. They also do not match any carpets described in an inventory of the shrine from 1795. On the other hand, at their presumed original size, the two would fit into a space in the more important Imam Reza Shrine at Mashad.: \\"Judging from a small-scale plan of the shrine complex the two carpets, end to end, would fit into the sanctuary of the Gowhar-≈†ƒÅd mosque, and possibly elsewhere if used singly.\\" Reproduction of the Ardabil Carpet in Ardabil, Iran This carpet was sold by the dealer Edward Stebbing of Richardson and Company as \\"The Holy Carpet of the Mosque at Ardebil\\", stressing the \\"exceptionalism of the carpet and its provenance as a product of the Safavid royal atelier of Shah Tahmasp, made for the Safavid dynastic shrine at Ardabik‚Äù. William Morris advised the V&A; in the acquisition: \\"It was William Morris, in his capacity as one of the V&A;'s Art Referees, who persuaded the Museum to raise, with the aid of public subscription, the then vast sum of ¬£2000 to purchase the carpet in March 1893\\". Morris wrote in a letter to Thomas Armstrong that ‚Äúit has no counterpart‚Äù. Gradually, word came out that there was a second Ardabil carpet. When the Victoria and Albert Museum began to check out the piece in 1914, the historical consensus came to be that the modifications on the current Los Angeles Ardabil to repair the London Ardabil were managed by Ziegler and Company, the first buyer of the carpets from Persian resident Hildebrand Stevens, supposedly using Tabriz or Turkish craftsmen. The second Ardabil had visible changes in its structure, with its borders replaced into a newly woven narrow line while the London Ardabil was thoroughly over-restored. Historians of the time spoke to this, stating 'The highest market value was for complete carpets, rather than damaged ones or fragments. The London carpet was ‚Äòa remarkable work of Art‚Äô, and as Morris has said, of real historical importance, but it had been compromised to suit the market values of 19th century art connoisseurship.' The carpet was for decades displayed hanging on a wall. Since 2006, it has been shown flat in a special glass pavilion in the centre of the Jameel gallery, Room 42 of Islamic art. The lighting is kept very low to prevent fading, and is increased for a brief period each hour. The second \\"secret\\" carpet, smaller, now borderless and with some of the field missing, made up from the remaining usable sections, was sold to the American businessmen Clarence Mackay and was exchanged by wealthy buyers for years. Passing through the Mackay, Yerkes, and De la Mare art collections, it was eventually revealed and shown in 1931 at an exhibition in London. American industrialist J. Paul Getty saw it, and bought it from Lord Duveen for approximately $70,000 several years later. Getty was approached by agents on behalf of King Farouk of Egypt who offered $250,000 so that it could be given as a wedding present to his sister and the Shah of Iran. Getty later donated the carpet to the Los Angeles County Museum of Science, History, and Art in the Exposition Park in Los Angeles. Other fragments have appeared on the market from time to time. The knot density is actually higher on the Los Angeles carpet. It is now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles. In 2003 it was cleaned and restored by the Royal Collection's Textile Conservation Studios at Hampton Court Palace, near London.  Copies  The Ardabil Carpet was an original design, though in the style of some other Persian carpets of the same period. It has been the subject of numerous copies ranging in size from small rugs to full scale carpets. There is an 'Ardabil' at 10 Downing Street (office of the British Prime Minister), and even Adolf Hitler had an 'Ardabil' in his office in Berlin. Commercial copies of the carpet for sale range from prices of $200 to $45,000.

Synopsis The Gavriiliada is a satiric description of the beginning of the New Testament, primarily making fun of the virgin birth and God's ineptness. In Pushkin's narrative, Mary, the mother of Jesus, a young and attractive Jewish girl, is married to an old and impotent carpenter who has taken her as wife only to keep house. God chooses her to be the mother of Jesus and sends Archangel Gabriel to announce the good news. Satan learns about God's plan and arrives first in the form of a snake to seduce and deflower Mary. Gabriel arrives too late to save her from Satan but manages to drive him off with an illegal punch to testicles. Then he quickly has his way with Mary, who had already seen him in a vision and was impatiently waiting for him. The next morning, God in the form of a dove flies into Mary's bedroom and has intercourse with her, thus thinking He has conceived Jesus. Case of Gavrieliad The poem was written anonymously because the author could be prosecuted for blasphemy by the Holy Synod. In 1828, an official investigation of the alleged authorship by Pushkin started. After initially denying writing the poem, Pushkin admitted it in a letter to Nicholas I.

It is part of the Parish of Ecclesfield. It is historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire.  Geography  Railway bridge and road junction in the town centre Chapeltown is located approximately north of Sheffield city centre on the railway between Sheffield and Barnsley. Chapeltown railway station is served by the Penistone Line and Hallam Line. Two junctions of the M1 motorway also serve the area. The A6135 road passes through the town from north to south and is joined near the town centre by the A629 road from the south-east and the B6546 road from the west. Like much of Sheffield, there is a large amount of greenspace in and around Chapeltown. The town centre has a cricket ground and a wooded park on either side of it. Between Chapeltown and Ecclesfield the land is used for residential purposes on one side of the main road and agricultural on the other. There is also a brownfield site above the park.  History  Until industrialization, Chapeltown was a hamlet that originated at the intersection of the roads between Sheffield and Barnsley and between Rotherham and Wortley. In the late 16th century a blast furnace was installed there which initially used charcoal, and from 1780 was fired with coke. Chapeltown was part of the ecclesiastical parish of Ecclesfield and had a population of 4063 persons around 1870. Coal mining was one of the main occupations of the inhabitants. The works of Newton, Chambers & Company were first established in Chapeltown in 1793.Jones 1999:148 Initially they were an iron works specialising in cast iron products, but over time the company expanded into related mining industries and products from the fractional distillation of coal, including the Izal disinfectant range. In the Second World War they produced Churchill tanks. The site of this company is now Thorncliffe Industrial Estate where most of the industry in Chapeltown is located.

D.V.M. thesis, Veterinary Medical Faculty, Bern University 1984 as well as the domestic cat. Like many other mammalian secretion glands, the violet gland consists of modified sweat glands and sebaceous glands. It is used for intra-species signalling, scent marking, and contributes to the strong odor of foxes in particular. Although it secretes a mixture of volatile terpenes similar to those produced by violets (hence the name), the chemicals are produced in much greater quantity than in flowers, and the resulting strong smell can be quite unpleasant. By species In dogs, the violet or supracaudal gland is found approximately above the 9th caudal vertebra, but depending on breed it may be vestigial or entirely absent. The violet gland secretes protein and hydrophobic lipids, has wide excretory ducts, is connected with coarse hairs, devoid of cysts, and has no sexual dimorphism. In the dog and cat fancy it is often referred to as \\"stud tail\\", despite the fact that it occurs in all sexes, not just breeding males. However, for reasons still unknown the hair at a dog's violet gland tends to fall out when androgen levels are high over a prolonged time. In short-haired breeds the usually inconspicuous gland may thus appear as a noticeably sparsely haired patch, and it is this condition of the gland area that is most frequent in stud dogs. In foxes, the violet gland is found on the upper surface of the tail, at roughly one-third of the tail's length from the body, and measures about 25 by 7.5 millimeters in red foxes. Due to its role in steroid hormone metabolism (and possibly production), foxes cannot be \\"de-scented\\" by removing this gland. For unknown reasons, the gland's secretions are fluorescent in ultraviolet light; this may result from the presence of carotenoids.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the seventeenth written by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was illustrated by John R. Neill. Synopsis The book's heroine is an \\"honest and industrious\\" goat-girl named Mandy, who grazes her flock on the slopes of Mt. Mern (a location otherwise unidentified). The story opens with a bang and a splash: an underground spring erupts in a geyser that blasts Mandy into the sky. The force propels her across the Deadly Desert to Oz; she lands in the little principality of Keretaria in the Munchkin Country, her impact cushioned by the power of a magic blue daisy. Mandy finds a silver hammer, and meets a white ox with golden horns; she blunders into the court of King Kerr of Keretaria and his courtiers. They are outraged by the intrusion of such an outlandish figure -- for Mandy has seven arms and hands. As Mandy explains, :\\"This iron hand...I use for ironing, lifting hot pots from the stove and all horrid sort of hard work; this leather hand I keep for beating rugs, dusting, sweeping, and so on; this wooden hand I use for churning and digging in the garden; these two red rubber hands for dishwashing and scrubbing, and my two fine white hands I keep for holding and braiding my hair.\\" Mandy, for her part, is amazed to meet so many two-handed people; on Mt. Mern, everyone has seven hands. Mandy is reprieved from the dungeons by Nox the Royal Ox, who takes her as his personal slave. Mandy and Nox quickly become friends. (It is Nox who gives the girl her nickname, Handy Mandy.) Nox is preoccupied by the political situation of Keretaria: the rightful king, a boy named Kerry, has disappeared, and his throne has been usurped by his uncle Kerr. Mandy discovers that the Royal Ox' horns have magic powers: they can be unscrewed from his head, and when they are, the right horn grants wishes, and his left horn offers clues. When a clue indicates that King Kerry can be found at a place called the Silver Mountain, the enterprising Mandy leads Nox on a search for the missing monarch. They swim rivers and survive a flood on their way to the Gillikin Country. A doorway hidden under a waterfall leads them to a subterranean world under the Silver Mountain. The domain is ruled by an evil and ambitious tyrant called the Wizard Wutz. Wutz controls a subversive network of spies and secret agents located in many parts of the land of Oz. He is plotting to have his agents steal all the main magical artifacts of Oz. They actually do steal the Magic Picture, Glinda's Great Book of Records, and the jug that is the confinement vessel of Ruggedo, the Gnome King (he was transformed into a jug at the end of Pirates in Oz). Mandy and Nox learn that old King Kerr is one of Wutz' agents and that Wutz is holding the rightful King Kerry prisoner. Wutz's machinations have of course attracted the notice of Princess Ozma, the Wizard of Oz, Princess Dorothy, the Scarecrow,Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 58-9, 151-2, 186-7, 238-9. and their friends and allies. Yet their efforts to solve their difficulties are frustrated, since they lack the Magic Picture and Book of Records. When Mandy and Nox confront Wutz, he imprisons them in a dungeon under his mountain. Mandy accidentally liberates Ruggedo from the jug. Wutz and Ruggedo instantly become allies in evil and set off for the Emerald City to complete their conquest. Mandy's silver hammer, though, has proven to be magic; striking it calls forth a helpful purple elf named \\"Himself\\", who has formidable magic powers. With the hammer and elf, the blue daisy, and Nox's magical horns, Mandy and the ox escape confinement, find and rescue King Kerry, and reach Ozma's palace in time to frustrate the plans of Wutz and Ruggedo. Himself the elf transforms the two villains into potted cacti. (This is the last appearance of Ruggedo the Gnome King in the \\"Famous Forty\\" Oz books, though he does re-appear in the works of later Oz authors.) Ozma restores order and repairs damage with her Magic Belt. Wutz's spies and agents are transformed into moles; Kerry is returned to his throne. Mandy is rewarded with an emerald necklace and a luxury she has longed for -- gloves; Ozma gives her seven sets of seven gloves for her seven hands. After a month at home on Mt. Mern, Mandy returns to Oz (with her goats) via wishing pill, for a new life. The plot of this book strongly resembles that of Baum's The Lost Princess of Oz, in which Ugu the shoemaker steals magical artifacts and kidnaps a ruler in a conquest plot, just like the Wizard of Wutz. Indeed, Trot comments on the plot resemblance in Chapter 14 of Handy Mandy. The characters Thompson later wrote a 48-line poem that provides an origin for Mandy, though this origin is inconsistent with the novel. In the poem, Mandy is an artificial and created being, made of \\"wood and tin...wire and cloth and plaster....\\" She was built as a sort of domestic robot to perform housework.Ruth Plumly Thompson, \\"Handy Mandy: Solomon T. Wise's New Cook,\\" Oz- story Magazine, No. 1 (June 1995), p. 62. The novel, in contrast, clearly indicates that Mandy, despite her inanimate parts, comes from a race of seven- handed people. The principal villain, the Wizard Wutz, is another unusual character for Oz: a handsome, smooth, graceful but pure-evil villain who commands a hierarchical organization of subversives, with planted spies in positions of power all over the land of Oz, and a systematic collective strategy for overthrowing the government. Ruggedo the Gnome King makes his last appearance in the Oz-Canon of Forty here. It's very small, barely more than a cameo. He begins having been transformed into a jug (see Pirates in Oz) and ends transformed into a cactus.

History The Dialogue Mass was an intermediate development in the twentieth century liturgical reform that culminated in the reform of the Roman Mass authorised by the Second Vatican Council and promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969. Before the introduction of the Dialogue Mass, the people had little active participation in the Mass other than interior disposition. This was intended to emphasise the fact that Catholics gathered together to witness and participate in an action (i.e. the sacramental renewal of the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary) rather than merely participate in common prayer which was a hallmark of the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The introduction of bilingual hand Missals (Latin-vernacular) occurred in Germany in the 19th century in defiance of Church law which required the liturgical texts to be reproduced exclusively in Latin. Later given authorisation, they allowed the laity to quietly follow the Mass (\\"Pray the Mass\\") rather than the traditional practice of saying private prayers as the priest celebrated. The subsequent step was the people actually saying the Latin responses of the Mass called the Dialogue Mass. In 1922, the Holy See gave approval to the practice whereby \\"at least in religious houses and institutions for youth, all people assisting at the Mass make the responses at the same time with the acolytes\\", a practice that it declared praiseworthy in view of the evident desire expressed in papal documents \\"to instil into the souls of the faithful a truly Christian and collective spirit, and prepare them for active participation.\\" The practice was already established without authorisation in Belgium and in Germany before the First World War. Further approval was granted in 1935 and 1958. However, the Dialogue Mass was not obligatory and there were conflicting statements about the practice from the Vatican. The Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 1922, shortly after the incipient Dialogue Mass, replied to the question \\"May the congregation, assisting at the Sacrifice make the responses in unison, instead of the server?\\" by saying: \\"The norm is: Things that in themselves are licit are not always expedient. Owing to the difficulties which may easily arise, as in this case, especially on account of the disturbances which the priests who celebrate and the people who assist may experience, to the disadvantage of the sacred Action and of the rubrics. Hence it is expedient to retain the common usage, as we have several times replied in similar cases.\\" The Dialogue Mass never became prevalent in English-speaking countries and current celebrations of Tridentine Mass in these countries are in practice rarely structured as a Dialogue Mass. In other countries, however, such as France, and Germany, the Dialogue Mass met with a greater acceptance as the Church hierarchies of these countries in the 1940s and 1950s tended to be more progressive than the generally traditionally-minded bishops in English-speaking lands as became evident during the Second Vatican Council. A number of Tridentine Masses currently celebrated in these countries use the Dialogue Mass form. Forms of Dialogue Mass The minimum form of Dialogue Mass introduced in 1922 allowed the people to join with the servers in reciting the responses in the Ordinary of the Mass. In addition, the people were allowed to recite those parts of the Ordinary of the Mass that are sung by all at a Missa Cantata, the Gloria, Creed, Sanctus and Agnus Dei, and to recite with the priest the triple \\"Domine non sum dignus\\" that he said as part of the rite of Communion of the faithful. Rarely, the people were also allowed to recite the Introit, Offertory and Communion Antiphons sung by the choir at a Solemn or High Mass. The form to be used in a particular diocese was left to the discretion of the bishop.

I don't want to be proud and haughty.\\" Dorothy agreed to show him the way, but after a short time the two became inexplicably lost.

Nevertheless, eager to be a good subject to the princess, he agreed to Ozma's decree that the Love Magnet be donated to the Emerald City and hung over the city gates. In The Patchwork Girl of Oz, the Shaggy Man serendipitously arrived to rescue Ojo and his traveling companions from man-eating plants that attacked them along a yellow brick road in the Munchkin Country.Riley, p. 173. In Tik-Tok of Oz, it was revealed that the Shaggy Man had a long-lost brother who was being held prisoner by the Nome King.Riley, p. 182. Much of that book revolves about his efforts and those of his companions to rescue and disenchant this brother. Finally, the Shaggy Man decides to give up Oz to remain with his brother and other companions; the prospect of losing him from Oz persuades Ozma to allow these others to enter Oz.Riley, p. 184. Much like the Shaggy Man himself, this brother has no name which is ever revealed to the readers, and is simply identified as \\"the Shaggy Man's brother.\\" He was called Wiggy in the stage version. In The Shaggy Man of Oz, the love magnet has worn through the nail and broken, and the Shaggy Man must go to the creator of the love magnet, Conjo (a retcon) in order to have it fixed. To get there, he visits many of the places visited in John Dough and the Cherub. In the modern Oz book Queen Ann in Oz (1993), authors Carlson and Gjovaag give the Shaggy Man a personal name -- Shagrick Mann.Karyl Carlson and Eric Gjovaag, Queen Ann in Oz, New York, Emerald City Press, 1993; p. 114. Portrayal Although Baum used The Shaggy Man a great deal in his books from his first appearance onward, he did not appear in any productions of The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, nor did he appear much in the work of Baum's successors other than Jack Snow. Frank F. Moore would portray the role on the Los Angeles stage opposite James C. Morton as Tik-Tok in the 1913 play The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. The role was modeled on Fred Stone's Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz, and Moore would go on to play the Scarecrow in His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz. In comics, Shaggy Man appeared briefly in Eric Shanower's The Ice King of Oz and in issue #19 of Oz. In other media The Shaggy Man appears in Return to Oz. He is seen in the background at Princess Ozma's coronation.

Originally an actual label for Thirlwell's self-released early Foetus EPs and albums, Self Immolation became more akin to a vanity label for Thirlwell's releases on Some Bizzare Records and Wax Trax! Records. Most Self Immolation releases are identified by a call number beginning with a Foetal- inspired \\"WOMB\\" designator. Beginning in the early 1990s, Thirlwell began a second personal label, Ectopic Entertainment (often shortened to Ectopic Ents). Its exact relation to Self Immolation is unclear: initially called a \\"subsidiary\\" of Self Immolation, it appears to have later wholly replaced Self Immolation. Coming full circle, Thirlwell's self-released Manorexia project is released on Ectopic Ents.

Examples of bundles that contain executable code include applications, frameworks, and plugins. This kind of bundle usually contains one file representing executable code, and files that represent resources such as nibs, templates, images, sounds, and other media. On some other systems, such as Microsoft Windows, these resources are usually included directly in the executable file itself at compile time. On older Macintoshes, a similar technique is used, where additional metadata can be added to a file's resource fork. Similar in concept are the application directories used in RISC OS and on the ROX Desktop. Examples of bundles that do not contain executable code include document packages (iWork documents) and media libraries (iPhoto Library). Bundles are programmatically accessed with the \`NSBundle\` class in Cocoa, NeXTSTEP and GNUstep's Foundation frameworks, and with \`CFBundle\` in Core Foundation. Bundles often include an file for metadata. The Uniform Type Identifier (UTI) for an Apple bundle is \`com.apple.bundle\`. Application bundles Application bundles are directory hierarchies, with the top-level directory having a name that ends with a \`.app\` extension. In an application bundle, the first directory in the bundle underneath the top-level directory is usually named \`Contents\`. Within \`Contents\` there is usually another directory (called \`MacOS\` on Macs), which contains the application's executable code. Within the \`Contents\` folder there is usually also a directory called \`Resources\`, which contains the resources of the application. Among other things, the \`Resources\` folder contains localized versions of the application's nib files. Other common subdirectories include \`Plugins\`, \`Frameworks\`, and \`Shared Frameworks\`. The \`Frameworks\` directory contains frameworks used by the application, and are used even if another version of the framework exists on the system. The \`Shared Frameworks\` directory contains frameworks that can be used both by the application that contains them, and other applications; they are used only if a newer version does not exist elsewhere on the system. \`Plugins\` contains extensible code used by the application. By default, the Finder displays application bundles, which can also be referred to as packages, as opaque files with no underlying structure; the contents of the bundle can be shown with the \\"Show Package Contents\\" context menu item. GNUstep by default uses the name of the application to name the folder that contains application code. An alternative is to name them by the computer architecture and OS the code is intended for to form a fat binary, so the application can be opened on many platforms. macOS framework bundles macOS frameworks are also stored as bundles; the top-level directory of a framework bundle has a name that is the name of the framework followed by the extension \`.framework\`. In the top-level directory is a \`Versions\` directory, with subdirectories for one or more versions of the framework, each subdirectory containing the dynamic library code for the framework, in a file whose name is the same as the name of the framework, possibly with a \`Headers\` folder containing header files for the framework, and other subfolders such as \`Resources\`. The \`Versions\` directory also contains a symbolic link \`Current\` to the directory for the current version of the framework. In the top-level directory are symbolic links to the contents of \`Versions/Current\`. The Finder displays framework bundles as directories rather than as opaque files. Although GNUstep uses frameworks, they are not usually stored as bundles. This is because the full semantics of framework loading are considered too alien to other platforms. Loadable bundles Loadable bundles are bundles which contain code that can be loaded at runtime.Code Loading Programming Topics for Cocoa: About Loadable Bundles Loadable bundles usually have the extension \`.bundle\`, and are most often used as plug-ins. On macOS, there is a way to load bundles even into applications that do not support them, allowing for third party hacks for popular applications, such as Safari and Apple Mail. A feature inherited from NeXTSTEP, GNUstep has the interface too. By default, the Finder displays loadable bundles, which can also be referred to as packages, as opaque files with no underlying structure; the contents of the bundle can be shown with the \\"Show Package Contents\\" context menu item. Other bundle formats There are many third-party macOS applications which utilize their own custom bundle format (e.g. CandyBar \`.iContainer\`, Aperture \`.aplibrary\`, VMware Fusion \`.vmwarevm\`, etc.). .lproj An .lproj file is a bundle that contains localization files for OpenStep, macOS, or GNUstep software. It typically contains the \`.nib\` files for a given language along with \`.strings\` files and images if needed (for example, ReadMe or license files). These localized files are used by installer makers to customize install packages. They are also included in an application bundle.

Maninder Singh retired prematurely due to personal reasons. Singh holds the Test record for the most Tests in a complete career without aggregating 100 runs. Career Maninder Singh began his career playing against Pakistan at Karachi, in December 1982. His last match was against Zimbabwe in May 1993. He was regarded as an heir apparent of the legendary Bishan Singh Bedi, and at the height of his career, he was reputed to possess a huge variety in his arsenal. He is often credited to have bowled an over, in which each of the six balls would be different than the previous one juggling with flight, length and spin. His international career was however cut short due to lot of internal team politics. He took 88 wickets in his 35 Tests, with a best of seven wickets for 27 runs. He took 66 wickets in One Day Internationals and a best of four wickets for 22 runs. He is now mostly remembered for his dismissal in the Madras test resulting in a tie against Australia in 1986‚Äì87 series.

The station airs a hot adult contemporary format branded as Mix 96.7. History Cheer-FM logo (2001-2008) =710AM CJSP/Cheer Radio= The station was launched in 1955 by Sun Parlor Broadcasting at 710 AM, as a daytimer with a 250-watt transmitter, using the callsign CJSP. The principal shareholders in Sun Parlour Broadcasting were Al Bruner, John Garton Sr., Lou Tomasi and Art Gadd. The station increased its power to 1,000 watts in 1960. The \\"SP\\" in the call sign stood for \\"Sun Parlour,\\" a nickname for the Leamington/southern Essex County region of Ontario. CJSP was a small-town station typical of its era with a variety of programming including a Top 40 show; the station distributed a record survey called \\"The Fascinatin' Fifty\\" in that era. In late 1967, the station adopted its current callsign, and received approval from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to broadcast at nighttime; due to clear channel rules, the station remained on 710 during the day, but shifted to 730 at night. The switch in frequency was called fine tuning time, and was accompanied by a Lou Tomasi voiced 60-second audio bed series of varying-pitched beeps which helped the listener re-tune (hopefully) to the station where they would be told \\"you're back on the beam with Cheer Radio\\". The nighttime station also used a different callsign, CHIR, but retained the same Cheer branding. During its years of operation on two frequencies, the station had two licenses, one for each call sign. In 1968, the station was sold to Rogers Communications, although Sun Parlour Broadcasting continued to operate as a separate subsidiary. As \\"Channel Seven, Cheer Radio,\\" CHYR/CHIR aired a very contemporary and upbeat MOR music format bordering on Top 40, an approach that might be today considered Hot AC. In the mid-1970s, they started to spell out the daytime call letters on-air \\"C-H-Y-R\\" as well as use the phrase \\"Super Seven Cheer\\" and variations with a new Pepper/Tanner jingle package (reportedly as a light poke at the \\"Big 8\\" just up the road in Windsor), but overall the format approach and on-air policy was always \\"bright, tight, brief and real!\\" Original Studios, 23 Erie St. N (top floor) In 1974, the CHIR calls were quietly abandoned, and the nighttime transmitter's call sign instead became CHYR-7. The station increased its nighttime power from 250 to 500 watts that year. In 1975, Keith Dancy acquired Sun Parlour Broadcasting from Rogers, although two years later he sold the station back to Rogers, along with CKJD in Sarnia, in exchange for CHIQ in Hamilton. Combo announcer/news configuration, Talbot St. Studios, mid 1970s =Soft AC years/CHYR Country/Move to FM= In 1987, the station's ownership was spun off to Blue Water Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Maclean-Hunter. Four years later, the station dropped its longtime adult contemporary sound for a country music format, citing listener demand for Canadian country music as an impetus for the change. In 1993, the station received CRTC approval to move to FM.Decision CRTC 93-52 In preparation for the move, most of the AM transmitter towers had to be demolished to make room for the new FM tower; as a result, the 730 frequency was abandoned and the station operated full-time at reduced power on 710 for a few months. The move to FM was completed in July of that year. After a brief period of simulcasting, CHYR ceased operations on 710 kHz at 6 p.m. on September 10, 1993. In 1994, Maclean-Hunter was acquired by Rogers, and The Blue Water Group was sold to Blackburn Radio. Former logo used from 2008‚Äì2015 =96.7 Cheer-FM/Mix 96.7= On April 22, 2001, the station abruptly dropped its country format after 10 years and flipped to Hot AC branded as 96.7 Cheer-FM, reviving the heritage \\"Cheer\\" name. Market vet Tim O'Neill took over mornings and Corey Robertson arrived in late 2001 for afternoons. On January 3, 2007, CHYR moved its broadcast tower from just outside Point Pelee to a new tower in Cottam, making the signal available to over 70 thousand more homes.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2006-286 On March 3, 2008, the station rebranded as Mix 96.7. In 2016, a new station on 96.7 (WNUC- LP) signed-on in the New Center neighbourhood of Detroit, Michigan, causing a substantial reduction in CHYR's signal to Detroit, with interference stretching from Livonia and Redford to Warren and portions of the west end of Windsor.

It is sometimes confused with Sable Island. Historically, the Argyle, Nova Scotia region was known as Cape Sable and encompassed a much larger area than simply the island it does today. It extended from Cape Negro (Baccaro) through Chebogue. The island is situated in Shelburne County south of Barrington Head, separated from the mainland by the narrow strait of Barrington Passage, but has been connected since 1949 by a causeway. The largest community on the island is the town of Clark's Harbour. Other communities are listed below. At the extreme southern tip is Cape Sable. History Southern tip of Nova Scotia, showing Cape Sable Island. Cape Sable Island was inhabited by the Mi'kmaq who knew it as Kespoogwitk meaning \\"land's end\\". It was first charted by explorers from Portugal who named it Beusablom, meaning \\"Sandy Bay\\". =French Colony= Cape Sable and Cape Negro, Nova Scotia were first settled by the Acadians who migrated from Port Royal, Nova Scotia in 1620.M. A. MacDonald. Fortune and La Tour. Methuen Press. 1983.p.14 The French governor of Acadia, Charles de la Tour, colonized Cap de Sable giving it the present name, meaning Sandy Cape.Place Names of Nova Scotia Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management La Tour built up a strong post at Cap de Sable beginning in 1623, called Fort Lomeron in honour of David Lomeron who was his agent in France. (The fur trading post called Fort Lomeron was later renamed Fort La Tour although identified as Fort Saint-Louis in the writings of Samuel de Champlain.) Here he carried on a sizable trade in furs with the Mi'kmaq and farmed the land. During the Anglo-French War (1627‚Äì1629), under Charles 1, by 1629 the Kirkes took Quebec City, Sir James Stewart of Killeith, Lord Ochiltree planted a colony on Cape Breton Island at Baleine, and Alexander's son, William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling established the first incarnation of \\"New Scotland\\" at Port Royal, Nova Scotia. This set of British triumphs in what had otherwise been a disastrous war was not destined to last. Charles 1's haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant that the new North American gains would be bargained away in the Treaty of Saint-Germain- en-Laye (1632).Nichols, 2010. p. xix There were three battles in Nova Scotia during the colonization of Scots: one at Saint John; another battle at Balene, Cape Breton; and one on Cape Sable Island.

As an important landfall and base for seasonal New England fishing vessels working the rich fishing banks of Southwestern Nova Scotia, Cape Sable attracted several waves of pirate attacks in the Golden Age of Piracy. Pirates Ned Low and John Phillips raided fishing vessels off Cape Sable and Phillips met his death off the Cape in 1723.Dan Conlin, Pirates of the Atlantic (2009), Halifax: Formac Publishing, p. 34, 44, 52 In 1725 the British signed a treaty (or \\"agreement\\") with the Mi'kmaq of Cape Sable and other parts of Nova Scotia but the rights of the Mi'kmaq defined in it to hunt and fish on their lands have often been disputed by the authorities. =French and Indian War= The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour.John Grenier, Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia 1710-1760. Oklahoma University Press. 2008 The Acadians and Mi'kmaq from Cape Sable Island raided the Protestants at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia numerous times. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia. ‚Ä¢ In April 1756, Major Jedidiah Preble and his New England troops, on their return to Boston, raided a settlement near Port La Tour and captured 72 men, women and children.Winthrop Bell. Foreign Protestants, University of Toronto, 1961, p. 504; Peter Landry. The Lion and the Lily, Trafford Press. 2007.p. 555 In the late summer of 1758, the British launched three large offensives against the Acadians. One was the St. John River Campaign, another was the Petitcodiac River Campaign, and the other was against the Acadians at Cape Sable Island. Major Henry Fletcher led the 35th Regiment and a company of Joseph Gorham's Rangers to Cape Sable Island. He cordoned off the cape and sent his men through it. One hundred Acadians and Father Jean Baptiste de Gray surrendered, while about 130 Acadians and seven Mi'kmaq escaped. The Acadian prisoners were taken to Georges Island in Halifax Harbour.John Grenier, The Far Reaches of Empire, Oklahoma Press. 2008. p. 198 En route to the St. John River Campaign in September 1758, Moncton sent Major Roger Morris, in command of two men-of-war and transport ships with 325 soldiers, to deport more Acadians. On October 28, his troops sent the women and children to Georges Island. The men were kept behind and forced to work with troops to destroy their village. On October 31, they were also sent to Halifax.Marshall, p. 98; see also Bell. Foreign Protestants. p. 512 In the spring of 1759, Joseph Gorham and his rangers arrived to take prisoner the remaining 151 Acadians. They reached Georges Island with them on June 29.Marshall, p. 98; Peter Landry. The Lion and the Lily, Trafford Press. 2007. p. 555 =New England Planters= Following the Acadian Expulsion in the 1750s, the island was settled by the New England Planters from Cape Cod and nearby Nantucket Island. The waters off southwestern Nova Scotia had been well known to them since the days of French settlement in the early 17th century. While the tides of the Gulf of Maine may have brought a few exploring fishermen from Nantucket to the island, it was an entirely different tide that spawned the eventual permanent English settlement‚Äîa political tide. Many Cape New Englanders took advantage of the offer of of land to each male adult who would leave his home and live on those vacated lands in Atlantic Canada. Cape Sable Island was well known to Cape Cod fishermen and they moved north in 1760 to take advantage of a new life. The Cape Sable settlement soon became, and remains today, an important base for inshore fisheries. It is famous as the birthplace of the Cape Islander fishing boat, a motor fishing boat which emerged about 1905.\\"Nova Scotia Motorized Fishing Boats\\" by David A. Walker Ferry service provided transportation to the island in the early 20th century. A causeway was eventually constructed for pedestrian and automobile traffic, opening on August 5, 1949. Today the lobster fishery is the island's biggest industry. = American Revolution = Raid on Cape Sable Island (1778)  During the American Revolution, on September 4, 1778, the light infantry company of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants), under the command of Cpt. Ranald MacKinnon, was in the Raid of Cape Sable Island. American Privateers were threatening Cape Sable Island when the 84th Regiment arrived; they surprised the ship in the night and destroyed it. For his aggressive action, MacKinnon was praised highly by Brigadier General Eyre Massey. In response, one of his friends, Cpt. MacDonald, wrote to Major John Small, \\"McKinnon was embarrassed by the praise of the General and requested it not be inserted in the record since he only did his duty.\\"Kim Stacy (1994).

This traffic produced many shipwrecks such as the SS Hungarian in 1862 and the schooner Codseeker in 1877. Climate Cape Sable Island has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb), with significant continental influence. The surrounding waters result in cooler summers, but milder winters, with less snowfall, than the rest of Nova Scotia. Summer temperatures are very low for the latitude, and the climate borders the subpolar oceanic (K√∂ppen Cfc) type. At the peak of summer, in late August and early September, daily average high temperatures barely reach 15¬∞C. Winters are wet and windy, but warm for Atlantic Canada. Snowfall is moderately heavy, but winter brings less snow than in virtually all other locations in Atlantic Canada, which commonly average much more snow per winter season (for example, Sydney, Nova Scotia [283 cm] and St. John's, Newfoundland [335 cm]). Summers on Cape Sable Island are cool with much more stable weather when compared to winters. Due to surrounding cool ocean waters, summer thunderstorms are very rare, but low clouds and fog are common. The strong influence of the Atlantic Ocean also produces exceptionally strong seasonal lag. On average, the coldest month is February, while the warmest month is September, coming in slightly warmer than August, and October is much warmer than June. The island lies in the path of Nor'easters, which reach maximum frequency and intensity in winter, meaning this area's wettest months on average are December and January. Tropical weather systems, including, rarely, hurricanes can occur occasionally, generally entering the area from the south or southwest, with the greatest risk in September and October. Cape Sable Island is also prone to bouts of thick fog. Over the years the Cape's storms, and the close proximity of the island to shipping routes, has led to a substantial number of shipwrecks. The most tragic was the wreck of the SS Hungarian in February 1860 with the loss of over 200 lives. A lighthouse was established at the tip of Cape Sable in the next year.\\"SS Hungarian\\" Nova Scotia Museum Marine Heritage Database Residents In spite of what might seem to have been major deterrents to permanent settlement, many residents came and stayed. There were shiploads of Smiths, Nickersons, Atkinsons, Crowells, Newells, Townsends, Quinlans, Rosses, Swims, Kenneys, Brannens, Wickens, and many others; their descendants are still present some 250 years later. Archelaus Smith settled in Centreville, Michael Swim at Swims Point in Clark's Harbour, Newell families in Newellton, Daniel Vinson at Daniel's Head in South Side, Ross families at Stoney Island ‚Äì many of these surnames remain very common today. The Archelaus Smith Museum (1896) in Centreville, Nova Scotia is on the Canadian Register of Historic Places. Canadian Register of Historic Places Bird watching With the ocean lapping on all sides of the island, the climate is maritime - decidedly cool in summer but winters are considerably more moderate than interior parts of the province. The island is a notable birding destination, being an important migratory stopping point for birds such as the Atlantic brant and piping plover. It is this unique climate, its abundant tidal marshes and the island's geographical location on the north-south flight path of numerous migratory water fowl that has given it the international designation as an Important Bird Area. The annual brant geese fly-by during March and April is developing into a local birding event. The tens of thousands of brant make their spectacular fly by at dusk after spending the day feeding in local marshes. They spend the night bobbing in the Atlantic to the east of the island.Important Bird Areas of Canada page for Cape Sable Island See also * Cape Islander References Texts *Nicholls, Andrew.

A debut film by Jeffs, it was released in New Zealand in 2001 and internationally in 2002. It concerns the coming of age of 13-year-old Janey, and is based on the novel Rain, written by Kirsty Gunn. Rain was produced by Philippa Campbell.  Plot  Janey is on vacation with her brother Jim, mother Kate, and father Ed, at their beach house on the Mahurangi Peninsula in New Zealand. Ed and Kate, who are on the verge of divorce, sit in the backyard all day drinking whiskey, leaving their young children to amuse and fend for themselves. Cady, a local boatie who is having an affair with Kate, catches Janey's pubescent eye. In response to his wife's problems with alcohol and infidelity, Ed turns to alcohol, neglecting his children almost as much as his wife. When Janey sees Cady photographing Kate on his boat, she persuades him to take pictures of her as well. Then, like her mother, she wants something else from him. Leaving little Jim alone on the beach, Janey leads Cady high into the woods. After posing for him, she takes his camera and tells him how to pose. She adjusts his shirt and tells him to strip off. Then she puts his camera aside and starts touching him all over. They kiss, her head tilts back, and the screen goes black-and-white. In the next scene, A camera shot from far above shows Janey as she lies alone in the woods naked. She is next seen walking back down the woody hillside to the beach with her clothes on. Off in the distance she sees her brother's little body. She runs the length of the beach to him, screaming his name. When she reaches him she launches into frenzied CPR: \\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, breathe!\\" Her father arrives and takes over the CPR. Janey begs him, \\"Make him breathe!\\" and when he says he is trying, she yells at him that he isn't. They eventually have to realize that they are too late to save Jim and to save the family.

As a general practice, the British forces personnel socialised very much among themselves, according to their military ranks and status (i.e. officers as opposed to enlisted men). However, there were some instances when specific local Singaporean \\"guests\\" were invited to social functions hosted by the British. The term \\"Sarong party\\" came into use to describe social functions which included local invited \\"ladies\\" who wore the sarong, a native word for a wrap- around skirt popular among local Singaporean men and women of the time.https://goodyfeed.com/heres-the-reason-why-sarong-party-girls-are-called- sarong-party-girls/ Common stereotypes Historically, the stereotypical \\"Sarong party girl\\" had a false foreign accent, was provocatively dressed, and exclusively dated or preferred white men either resident in Singapore or foreigners. The Sarong party girl stereotype in local entertainment is usually portrayed as a gold-digging, husband-snatching Asian woman, and this perception contributed much to Singapore's decadent image in the 1970s, as seen in films such as Saint Jack. Due to these stereotypes, women who are classified as Sarong party girls often have to endure negative sweeping statements. The Sarong party girl stereotype was popularised by a series of humorous books by Australian writer Jim Aitchison in the 1990s, offering a satirical portrayal of the SPG and related aspects of Singaporean culture. Over time, the term has taken on a somewhat more derogatory meaning. Nowadays, Sarong party girls are no longer identified by a unique dress code or appearance, referring simply to any local woman who prefers to socialize with males of a Caucasian ethnicity, particularly for romantic or sexual relationships. A Sarong party girl is commonly perceived as a fetishist who is racist and discriminates against their own community and race stemming from self-hatred, while showing a favoritism towards white people and effectively abandoning their Asian identity.https://goodyfeed.com/heres-the-reason-why- sarong-party-girls-are-called-sarong-party-girls/  See also *Ang mo *Amejo *Asian fetish *Yellow cab (stereotype) *Pinkerton Syndrome Bibliography  ReferencesExternal linksDictionary definitions= *from the Coxford Singlish Dictionary *from A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English =Articles= *\\"Naked Blogger Attracts Thousands\\" (13 June 2005) from the Sydney Morning Herald Category:Pejorative terms for people Category:Singlish Category:Interpersonal relationships Category:Dating ","title":"Sarong party girl"},{"id":"2487727","text":"Kerry Talmage (March 23, 1963 ‚Äì June 17, 2004) was a Canadian comedian and actor, who developed a cult following in South Africa.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the nineteenth and last written by Ruth Plumly Thompson. It was illustrated by John R. Neill. The phrase \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was included in the title to coincide with the MGM film The Wizard of Oz, which was released the same year the book was published. As such, the focus of the story is on characters who appeared in the first book. Thompson focuses the book most strongly on Jellia Jamb,Thompson spells the name \\"Jam,\\" rather than Baum's \\"Jamb.\\" though that character was unnamed in the first book and was absent from the film. Synopsis The story opens with a dinner party, attended by seven of the characters from Baum's inaugural book, including the castle-housemaid Jellia Jam. After the dinner, the Wizard takes his guests to a glass-domed building that contains two gleaming silver aircraft, the newly created ozoplanes. The Wizard has named them the Ozpril and the Oztober. The guests enthusiastically pile into the craft to inspect them. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers is suddenly overcome by a violent stomach cramp from eating too many pickles. He slams into the control panel of the Oztober, causing it to take off. The Wizard, startled and appalled, takes the Ozpril in pursuit and in search of the Oztober, accompanied by Dorothy, Lion, and Scarecrow. Enduring a chaotic flight, the resourceful Tin Man eventually gets the Oztober under control; he lands in a previously unexplored sky-country called Stratovania. He enthusiastically but undiplomatically claims the place for Ozma as a colony of the Land of Oz. The ruler, Strutoovious the Seventh, also called \\"Strut of the Strat\\" for short, is outraged, and decides to turn the tables and conquer the land of Oz. He forces the Tin Woodman to fly him and his army to Oz, leaving Jellia and the Soldier behind in Stratovania. The Wizard and company arrive at Stratovania in the second ozoplane. But the plane is blown up by the Stratovanians, and the Ozites have to leap off the edge of the skyland to save themselves, riding on winged staffs stolen from two Stratovanians. (The Stratovanians all own winged staffs and use them for transportation.) The Wizard and his party land at Red Top Mountain in the Quadling Country. The place's rightful ruler, Princess Azarine, has escaped the clutches of the usurper Bustabo (an even worse villain than Strut) who captures the travelers. This villain sends the Wizard in search of Azarine, and holds the rest of the party hostage. The hostages escape, and meet up with the Wizard, Azarine, and her protectors, the great stag Shagomar and his wife Dear Deer. The group reaches the palace of Glinda, though the sorceress is absent with Ozma; the Wizard is able to use Glinda's magic to combat the Stratovanian invasion. Strut and his forces reach the Emerald City; the residents flee or hide. Strut tries to obtain Ozma's Magic Belt from her safe, but is frustrated; the Wizard has united with Ozma and Glinda to rescue the Belt, the most powerful magical talisman of Oz. Once in possession of the Belt, Ozma transports Strut's army home and ends his bid for conquest. She turns the usurper Bustabo into a red squirrel, so that Azarine can resume her rightful place. Thompson gives her protagonists some odd adversaries, including sky creatures called Spikers that are something like iridescent spiked blow-fishes, and a large fierce bugbear that is half insect and half bear. And she indulges in extravagant nonsensical tech talk, as with the Wizard's \\"elutherated altitude pills\\" and Glinda's \\"triple-edged, zentomatic transporter.\\" She also misuses the word \\"entomophagous\\" to mean insect-like; it actually means something that eats insects. \\"Airland\\" The stereotypical idea of landscapes in the clouds, \\"castles in the air,\\" cities and countries in the sky, can be found repeatedly in imaginative literature. Baum used it, most prominently in his Sky Island. Thompson included several sky countries in her Oz books,As with the Skyle of Un in The Cowardly Lion of Oz, or Atmos Fere's kingdom in The Hungry Tiger of Oz. and later Oz authors employed comparable materials (see Hightown in Jack Snow's The Shaggy Man of Oz for a pertinent example). Thompson's \\"splendid cloud mountains and cities\\" in this book shares in this established trope. In Ozoplaning, Thompson exploits current interest in developments in aeronautics and atmospheric science. She plays with the new terms \\"stratosphere\\" and \\"troposphere.\\"Webster's Dictionaries assign the earliest uses of both terms to 1909. (Similarly, the Wizard refers to \\"the outer stratosphere\\" in the 1939 MGM film.) Instead of lemonade, people in Stratovania drink \\"air-ade\\" (a pun on \\"air raid\\"), as well as \\"liquid air.\\" As the Tin Man struggles to control the Oztober on its wild first flight, he spies, in the light of dawn, what looks like a land in the clouds -- :\\"far ahead, between a bank of fog and an arch of platinum sun rays, loomed a long, lavender crescent. Nick even fancied he could see people moving about its glittering surface.\\"Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz, Chapter 4. Yet when he tries to land there, the plane crashes through a \\"frozen cloud.\\" Stratovania proves more substantial when they reach it; Thompson refers to the place as an \\"airland\\" or \\"skyland,\\" while the Tin Man calls it an \\"airosphere.\\" Its altitude is 101,867 feet; the controlled climate is so benign that the people live under canopies rather than in houses. The locale is described in brilliant terms -- :\\"Jellia saw a country of such dazzling beauty, she was almost afraid to breathe lest it vanish before her eyes. The trees were tall and numerous, with gleaming, prism-shaped trunks and a mass of cloudlike foliage. Some bore fruit that actually seemed to be illuminated -- oranges, pears, and peaches glowing like decorated electric light bulbs! Moon and star flowers grew in great profusion, and in the distance caves and grottoes of purest crystal scintillated in the high noon sun.\\"Ozoplaning, Chapter 6. The Stratovanians themselves are comparably impressive -- :\\"The Airlanders were a head taller than even the Tin Woodman. Their hair grew straight up on end, sparkling and crackling with electricity in a really terrifying manner. Their eyes were star-shaped and shaded by long, silver lashes; the noses and mouths were straight and firm, the foreheads transparent. Some shone as from a hidden sun, while across the brows of others tiny black clouds chased one another in rapid succession. Watching their foreheads would be a good way, decided Jellia Jam, to find out whether they were pleased or angry. Strut and his subjects wore belted tunics of some iridescent, rainbow-hued material, and silver sandals laced to the knee.\\" Their silver footwear recalls the silver slippers of the Wicked Witch of the East in Baum's first Oz book. Thompson's puns maintain the sky theme: the newspaper Strut reads is a \\"morning star.\\" His people live the \\"high life.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The novel's text online * On Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz Category:Oz (franchise) books Category:1939 American novels Category:1939 fantasy novels Category:1939 children's books ","title":"Ozoplaning with the Wizard of Oz"},{"id":"2487747","text":"Thomas and Jackie Hawks were a couple from Prescott, Arizona, United States, who were murdered in 2004.

At age 14, he appeared in the series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as an uncredited extra in the episode \\"Second Chance\\". As an adult, Deleon struggled to remember lines, and his career faltered as a result. At age 20, he joined the United States Marine Corps, but he went on Unauthorized Absence (UA) fifteen days later. He was later given an other than honorable discharge. = Others involved = * Jennifer Henderson, wife of Deleon. * Alonso Machain, former Seal Beach correctional officer who met Deleon while Deleon was serving time in prison for burglary. * John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Insane Crips gang member in Long Beach and former youth pastor, ex-convict for attempted murder, recruited the same day of the murder. * Myron Sandora Gardner, Sr., former Insane Crips gang member and ex-convict for involuntary manslaughter, who met Deleon at work after Deleon's release from prison, declined to participate in the crime but introduced Deleon to Kennedy.  Investigation  Police inquired into the couple's disappearance. On November 26, 2004, an attempt was made to access the Hawkses' bank account from Mexico. The family was notified and filed a missing-persons report with the Carlsbad police department. On November 29, the police interviewed Skylar Deleon. He told them that he bought the boat from the Hawkses and showed them proof-of-purchase documents. He stated to police that the Hawkses left in their car with their money, denied being in their car, and named Alonso Machain as witness to the purchase. The reason that he bought the boat, he claimed, was that he intended to launder money related to an armed burglary in 2002 for which he had been convicted. In March 2005, after initially fleeing to Mexico and then returning, Machain confessed to the crime. He was arrested in connection with the couple's disappearance along with Deleon and Deleon's wife Jennifer. Skylar Deleon initially maintained his innocence, claiming that he was not present at the time and speculating that the Hawkses were killed over a drug deal gone bad.  Trials  Authorities alleged that during a sea trial of the boat in Newport Beach Harbor a few days after meeting the Hawks, Deleon and his accomplices ‚Äî Alonso Machain and John Fitzgerald Kennedy ‚Äî bound and gagged the couple and threw them overboard, tied to the yacht's anchor. Deleon allegedly masterminded the plan to kill the couple for financial gain and enlisted Machain to help. Deleon's wife, Jennifer, was found guilty on two counts of first degree murder on November 17, 2006, after four hours of jury deliberation. In October 2007, Jennifer Deleon (now calling herself Jennifer Henderson, since her divorce from Skylar Deleon only a few months after the Hawkses' murders) was sentenced to two life terms without the possibility of parole. She is currently housed at Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, California. While awaiting trial in jail, Skylar Deleon was also charged with soliciting another inmate to murder his abusive father and his cousin. He was also accused of killing John Jarvi, a resident of Anaheim who was found dead in Mexico in 2003. Deleon's father and cousin (who was charged as an accessory to the Jarvi murder) are considered \\"important witnesses\\" in both murder cases. On March 13, 2008, Deleon partially severed his penis with a razor blade while being held in jail. After receiving medical attention, he was returned to jail the following day. In an interview with ABC's 20/20, Deleon indicated that he attempted to cut off his penis because he wanted to be a woman. Defense lawyers claimed that Deleon's need for money to finance a sex-change operation was the motivation for the Hawkses' murders. On September 22, 2008, jury selection began in the case against Skylar Deleon. In a consolidated case, Deleon was jointly tried for the murders of Thomas and Jackie Hawks as well as the murder of John Jarvi. Despite Deleon's earlier protestations of innocence, once her trial began, Deleon's attorney conceded that Deleon had indeed committed all three murders. The attorney said that he had taken the case to trial only to argue to a jury that Deleon should not be sentenced to death. On October 20, Deleon was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for financial gain and multiple victims and on November 6, 2008, the jury rendered a death verdict. Sentencing was originally scheduled for January 16, 2009, but was then rescheduled to March 20 on request by Deleon's attorney. On March 13, it was announced that sentencing would again be rescheduled, to April 10, so that the families of the victims could attend. On April 10, 2009, Deleon was sentenced to death by Orange County Superior Court Judge Frank Fasel. He is on death row at San Quentin State Prison. On February 19, 2009, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was found guilty on two counts of first degree murder after fewer than three hours of jury deliberation. He was sentenced to death on May 1, 2009. Like Deleon, Kennedy is on death row at San Quentin State Prison. Alonso Machain, after testifying against Deleon, Henderson, and Kennedy, pleaded guilty to two counts each of voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, and robbery. On June 15, 2009, he was sentenced to 20 years, 4 months. He likely will not be up for parole until 2023. He is currently serving his sentence at Valley State Prison in Chowchilla, California. In March 2009, after spending four years incarcerated, Myron Gardner pleaded guilty to \\"accessory after the fact\\" and the murder charges against him were dropped.

The crime is sometimes mentioned in connection with Jack the Ripper, and Pearcey has been posited as a Ripper candidate.Donald McCormick, The Identity of Jack the Ripper, Jarrolds, 1959William Stewart, Jack the Ripper: A New Theory, Quality Press, 1939 Early life Mary Pearcey was born Mary Eleanor Wheeler in 1866.Mary Eleanor Wheeler Pearcey. It has been erroneously stated that her father was a Thomas Wheeler who was convicted of and hanged for the murder of Edward Anstee. However, author Sarah Beth Hopton was unable to find any evidence of connection between the two people, and also found a retraction of the newspaper article in which the misinformation was first printed. Mary Wheeler took the name \\"Pearcey\\" from John Charles Pearcey, a carpenter with whom she had lived. He left her because of her infidelity. She later took up residence with a furniture remover, Frank Hogg, who had at least one other lover, Phoebe Styles. Styles became pregnant, and Hogg married her at Pearcey's urging. They lived in Kentish Town in London. Styles gave birth to a daughter also named Phoebe Hogg. Murder of Phoebe Hogg On 24 October 1890, Mrs. Hogg, with her baby, called on Pearcey at her invitation. At around 4:00 p.m., neighbours reportedly heard screaming and sounds of violence. That evening, a woman's corpse was found on a heap of rubbish in Hampstead. Her skull had been crushed, and her head was nearly severed from her body. A black perambulator was found about a mile away, its cushions soaked with blood. An eighteen-month-old child was found dead in Finchley, apparently smothered. After the adult body was initially speculated to be that of an 'unfortunate' in the press, it was eventually identified as Phoebe Hogg, with the toddler's body being that of her daughter. Mary Pearcey had been seen pushing baby Tiggy's perambulator around the streets of North London after dark. The police searched her house, and found blood spatter on the walls, ceiling, a skirt & apron, as well as matted hair & blood on a fireplace poker and carving knife. When questioned by the police she said that she, 'had a problem with mice and was trying to kill them'. Sir Melville Macnaghten wrote that Pearcey would later respond by chanting, \\"Killing mice, killing mice, killing mice!\\". Mary Pearcey was charged with murder. She maintained her innocence throughout the trial, but was convicted, and was hanged on 23 December 1890. Pearcey's murder case generated extraordinary press attention at the time. Madame Tussauds wax museum of London made a wax figure of Pearcey for their Chamber of Horrors exhibit, and also purchased the pram used in the murder and the contents of Pearcey's kitchen. When the Tussaud exhibit of these items opened, it attracted a crowd of 30,000 people. The noose used to hang Pearcey is on display at the Black Museum of Scotland Yard.  Execution  On 23 December 1890, Pearcey was hanged by James Berry. Berry noted her strong composure in the condemned cell, describing her as \\"the most composed person in the whole [execution] party.\\" When prompted to make a final statement Pearcey said, \\"My sentence is a just one, but a good deal of the evidence against me was false\\". At first she declined the assistance of female prison warders, but after further prompting, accepted their assistance saying, \\"Oh, well, if you don't mind going with me, I am pleased.\\" In his memoirs, Berry described Pearcey's execution as \\"quiet and painless.\\" Jill the Ripper? Mary Pearcey, like many other famous Victorian-era murderers, has been suggested as a suspect in the Jack the Ripper slayings. She was apparently the only female suspect mentioned at the time.Catalyst: Jack the Ripper Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes, speculated at the time that the Ripper might have been female, as a woman could have pretended to be a midwife and be seen in public in bloody clothing without arousing suspicion or notice.\\"DNA hints at Jill the Ripper,\\" Jade Bilowol, The Australian, 17 May 2006 This theory was then expanded upon in 1939 by William Stewart in his book Jack the Ripper: A New Theory, which specifically named Pearcey in connection with the crimes. All evidence given is circumstantial, and there is no physical evidence or eyewitness reports linking Pearcey to the Ripper crimes. F. Tennyson Jesse, the British criminal historian, explained the theory in her study of Pearcey's case: \\"It was no wonder that, simultaneously with the discovery of the crime, legends should have sprung up around her figure. The rumour even arose that the notorious Jack the Ripper had been at work in the locality, and though this was quickly disproved, yet the violence and horror associated with the crime was such as to make it understandable how the rumour arose in the first place. Even in the earliest paragraphs which announced the discovery of the crime, several false statements were suggested.\\" Gabriel Pombo, El Monstruo de Londres: La Leyenda de Jack el Destripador, Montevideo, Uruguay (2008), , pp. 203‚Äì204. In May 2006, DNA testing of saliva on stamps affixed to letters allegedly sent by Jack the Ripper to London newspapers, and thought by some modern writers to be genuine, appeared to come from a woman.The Independent This led to extensive discussion of Pearcey and her crime in the global press.

Ideally, rangatira were people of great practical wisdom who held authority on behalf of the tribe and maintained boundaries between a tribe's land and that of other tribes. Changes to land ownership laws in the 19th century, particularly the individualisation of land title, undermined the position of rangatira, as did the widespread loss of land under the colonial government. Etymology The word \\"rangatira' means \\"chief (male or female), wellborn, noble\\" and derives from Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian *langatila (\\"chief of secondary status\\"). Cognate words are found in Moriori, Tahitian, Cook Islands MƒÅori, Tuamotuan, Marquesan and Hawaiian. Interpretations A sign explaining the tangata whenua history of The Bricks, Christchurch Three interpretations of rangatira consider it as a compound of the MƒÅori words \\"ranga\\" and \\"tira\\". In the first case, \\"ranga\\" is devised as a sandbar and the \\"tira\\" a shark fin. The allegoric sandbar helps reduce erosion of the dune (or people). The fin reflects both the appearance of the sandbar, and, more importantly, \\"its physical and intentional dominance as guardian\\"(Gray-Sharp, 2011, p. 195). Rangatira reinforce communities, cease to exist without them (\\"for what is a sandbar without sand?\\"), and have a protective capacity.Gray- Sharp (2011, p. 195). Ethnographer John White (1826-1891) gave a different viewpoint in one of his lectures on MƒÅori customs. He said MƒÅori had traditionally formed two kahui who came together to discuss history or whakapapa. :\\"Each chief in the kahui had his place assigned to him, according to the amount of knowledge he possessed; and this place was given to him by the leader of the kahui of which he was a member. This act of the leader was called ranga, or putting in order. The people, as they came to the temple in a body, were called tira, or company; and as the leader had to assign, or ranga, a place to each of his tira, he was called the rangatira, from which we derive our word in Maori for chief, rangatira.\\"White, J.

NZETC, retrieved 13 November 2001. This interpretation fits well with a second translation where \\"ranga\\" is an abbreviation of rƒÅranga (or weaving) and \\"tira\\" signifies a group. A third interpretation fits equally well with this translation, interlinking concepts related to the identity of the ‚Äòtira‚Äô. In the first instance, the conditional hospitalityDerrida, J. (2000).

The vessel took part in several Engagements on Lake Ontario and was the flagship of the Provincial Marine at the First Battle of Sackett's Harbor. In 1814, the vessel was renamed Niagara. Following the war, the sloop was converted to a transport and sold in 1837. Description Royal George was designed by Master Shipwright John Dennis of the Provincial Marine. The vessel measured 330 tons burthen and was long at the gundeck and at the keel. The sloop had a beam of and a draught of . The vessel was quantified a \\"ship corvette, square-rigged with a flush upper deck.\\" Royal George was initially armed with twenty carronades. In early 1813, two of the carronades were replaced with two guns. Later that year two more 32-pounder carronades were replaced with two carronades and the 9-pounder guns replaced with guns. By 1814, the vessel's armament was eighteen 32-pounder carronades, two 18-pounder guns and one gun. By 1815 Royal George was armed with eight 24-pounder guns, two guns and ten 24-pounder carronades. The initial complement was 95, by 1830, it had grown to 175. Service history In 1808, the British learned that the United States was constructing the brig at Oswego, New York. Their response was to order the construction of a warship that could match the capabilities of the American ship. The vessel's keel was laid down at the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston, Upper Canada in February 1809 and launched in July 1809. Royal George remained in a non-commissioned state until 1811 after the American embargo on Great Britain was lifted. The vessel entered service only after the Americans began to ready themselves for war. In 1811, the Provincial Marine underwent a review by Major General Isaac Brock and command of the force was given to Lieutenant Hugh Earl, who was promoted to Master and Commander of Royal George, now the flagship of the Provincial Marine. The War of 1812 began in July of that year and at the outset of the war, the British fleet on Lake Ontario was more powerful than their American foe. On 19 July, Royal George, Earl of Moira, and and a fifth unnamed ship, appeared off Sackett's Harbor, New York intent on battling with Oneida. At 06:00 Oneida sailed out intending to separate the British fleet into groups, but the British kept together and Oneida returned to port. There it anchored near the naval yard. Royal George, Moira and Prince Regent then sailed into the bay. The wind faltered during the British fleet's approach, allowing time for the carronades aboard Oneida to be carried ashore and mounted in the fortifications. As the British approached, the Americans began firing, claiming to have hulled Royal George several times. The British broke off their attack and retreated from the First Battle of Sacket's Harbor. For the rest of the summer and autumn of 1812, Royal George would primarily be used as a transport service for men and ammunition for the British Army. On 1 October, Earl in Royal George anchored off the Genesee River and sent an armed party ashore to Charlotte, New York. There the 80 armed men seized the dismantled sloop Lady Murray and a revenue cutter. Departing that day, they returned on 2 October to demand the rigging and masts for the sloop. At the time of the raid, Royal George was crewed by fifty members of the Provincial Marine with 64 members of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment augmenting them. This was the only success during the Engagements on Lake Ontario that took place while the British fleet was under the sole command of the Provincial Marine. =Flight of Royal George= In November 1812, Royal George was the largest warship on the lake, operating under the command of Hugh Earl (or \\"Earle\\"). On 9 November 1812, an American fleet of seven vessels under the command of Commodore Isaac Chauncey surprised Royal George as the sloop passed near the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario. Royal George eluded the American vessels by slipping into the North Channel between Amherst Island and the mainland as night fell, making her way into the safety of her home harbour at Kingston by 02:00. The following morning, 10 November, the American fleet resumed the pursuit, burning a small commercial vessel near Bath and proceeding along the shore. As they approached Kingston, they came under fire from shore batteries. Chauncey directed his vessel, Oneida and the rest of the American squadron to bombard and attempt to seize Royal George within Kingston's harbour. Artillery fire from the shore batteries along the shoreline, including two batteries on Point Henry, attempted to prevent them from closing on the British vessel. Round shot from the American vessels penetrated into the town but they were unable to capture Royal George, which had retreated further into the harbour around 16:00. At the end of the day, they anchored out of sight of Kingston, intending to resume their attack the next day. However, an approaching storm caused Chauncey to withdraw back to the American base at Sacketts Harbor without seizing their prize. One sailor was killed aboard Royal George, but little damage had been done to the ship beyond torn up rigging. This would be the only American attack on Kingston during the War of 1812 as more personnel were sent to this important military and naval centre and strong fortifications were built on Point Henry to defend the dockyards. It was the only time that shots were fired from Point Henry in its history. =Arrival of Commodore Yeo= During the winter of 1812‚Äì1813, the condition of Royal George deteriorated and during an inspection, the vessel was found to be \\"filthy and disorganized.\\" In November Chauncey ordered the blockade of Kingston by gunboats which prevented Royal George and the rest of the British squadron from resupplying garrisons on the Niagara Peninsula. In May 1813, Commander Robert Barclay arrived to take command of the Lake Ontario squadron, replacing Earl who was made supervisor of the naval arsenal. Barclay's posting was temporary as Captain Sir James Lucas Yeo had been named to take command of the naval forces on the Great Lakes, and given the flag rank of commodore. Yeo arrived at Kingston on 16 May 1813, with Barclay departing to command the squadron on Lake Erie. The commands of the ships were shuffled, and Commander William Mulcaster was given command of Royal George, which was now manned by mostly Royal Navy personnel. The remaining Provincial Marine personnel were scattered throughout the squadron. On 27 May, Royal George was part of the squadron that set out to attack Sacketts Harbor with elements of British infantry. The squadron arrived on 28 May and promptly captured 115 American troops transiting the lake. Though Royal George did not directly participate in the following battle, the British managed to succeed in half of their objectives, destroying the American shipyard. Following this, the British withdrew into the lake. On 3 June, the squadron departed Kingston to resupply General John Vincent's forces in the Burlington Heights area. After anchoring overnight at York, Upper Canada, Yeo's force spotted a large American encampment near Forty Mile Creek. Yeo then ordered Beresford and Royal George to bombard the camp while the rest of the squadron resupplied Vincent. Confronted by Vincent's advancing force and Yeo's bombarding ships, the Americans withdrew quickly to Fort George. The squadron remained off Forty Mile Creek until 11 June and then set sail along the southern shore of Lake Ontario, trading fire with the fortifications at Fort Oswego and raiding Sodus. The squadron returned to Kingston on 26 June, transporting some of the Americans captured at the Battle of Beaver Dams. The squadron returned to Lake Ontario on 31 July. On 6 August, Royal Georges main powder magazine was flooded after the vessel sprang a leak. The sloop's store of powder was ruined and was only replenished from the other vessels of the squadron. However, the location of the leak was not found, with the pumps manned at all hours. The American squadron was spotted off Niagara River on 7 August at 04:30. Sailing southwest, the firing began at 07:30, but Chauncey turned east to keep his squadron under the protection of American shore batteries. In response, Yeo turned north, ending the engagement. On 10 August, the two squadrons came together again and Royal George, along with and , forced the surrender of two American schooners, and . Following the engagement, the British squadron anchored at York on 11 August. There, Royal Georges leak was found and repaired. The squadron departed on 13 August for Fort Niagara before heading for Kingston, arriving on 19 August. On 24 August, Yeo's squadron sailed again. They met the American squadron off the Genesee River on 11 September. Firing began at 14:30. Royal George and Lord Melville were the two British ships closest to the American battle line and suffered torn sails and rigging. Between the two vessels, they endured four killed and five wounded. At 16:00 the British retreated. Royal George was tasked with taking the schooner Hamilton under tow as Hamilton could not keep up with the rest of the squadron. The British returned to Kingston on 12 September. During the dockside period, Royal George received its circle-mounted 24-pounder long gun. Yeo and his squadron departed Kingston on 19 September, anchoring in Burlington Bay on 26 September. In what would become known as the \\"Burlington Races\\", Yeo engaged the Americans on 28 September. Trading shots with the American vessel , the British squadron's flagship Wolfe was crippled when the vessel's main topmast was brought down. Mulcaster placed Royal George between the two vessels, allowing Wolfe time to fix the problem. Royal George exchanged broadsides with General Pike, later joined by Lord Melville and Earl of Moira, forcing General Pike to turn away. Unable to fight aboard Wolfe, Yeo retreated to his anchorage in Burlington Bay, followed by the rest of the squadron. Once there, Royal George lost its foretopmast as it came into the anchorage. Once repairs were complete, the squadron sailed to confer with the British land forces commander, Major General Francis de Rottenburg at Four Mile Creek before returning to Kingston on 7 October. On 28 September, William Mulcaster was promoted to post captain and was awarded command of , under construction at Kingston. Royal George made one last patrol on 3 December before being laid up for the winter, during which the vessel was careened. =As Niagara and fate= Royal George was renamed Niagara on 22 January 1814. The vessel was reclassified from a sloop to a sixth rate and Captain Stephen Popham was awarded command. Once the Great Lakes became clear for navigation, Yeo intended to attack Fort Oswego. The squadron departed on 4 May with 400 Royal Marines and 550 soldiers embarked. They arrived on 5 May and during the night, Niagara and Montreal (the ex-Wolfe) slipped closer to shore, closing within . At 06:00 on 6 May, the two vessels opened fire attempting to enfilade the shore batteries. Niagara moved even closer to nearly within musket range and began trading fire directly with the fort. Niagara caught fire three times in the exchange. In the end, the British captured the fort and settlement, carrying away its supplies. The force returned to Kingston on 8 May. The squadron sailed again on 11 May along the south shore of the lake. On 19 May, the squadron imposed a blockade on Sackett's Harbor. Captain Popham was given command of two gunboats and ordered to intercept a flotilla of boats on 29 May. At Sandy Creek, Popham and nearly his entire command was either killed or captured by the Americans the next day. Niagara was manned only by a skeleton crew and to fill out the ship's company, personnel were shifted from HMS Magnet and . The blockade was lifted on 5 June and the squadron anchored in the Bay of Quinte. Captain Henry Davies was then given command of Niagara. The squadron returned to Kingston on 13 June and Niagara remained alongside for the better part of the summer. Following the launch of on 10 September, in the resulting command shuffle, Captain Edward Collier was given command of Niagara with Captain Davies being given command of . St Lawrence, Prince Regent, , Montreal and Niagara sailed from Kingston on 16 October and returned on 24 October. Upon the arrival of St Lawrence on Lake Ontario, the American squadron retired to Sackett's Harbor and did not venture forth again for the remainder of the war. Collier was then ordered to set up a naval base near Penetanguishene, Upper Canada. Niagara departed Kingston on 28 November carrying twenty of Princess Charlottes long guns to be used on ships constructed in the new base. Niagara arrived at York, where the supplies and guns were unloaded to be carried overland to the new base. On 24 December 1814, the Treaty of Ghent was signed, ending the War of 1812. Following the war, the vessel was used as a transport ship and was sold in 1837. =Historical reenactment= From 30 June to 1 July 2012, a 3-day reenactment of the flight of Royal George was performed from Bath, Ontario to Kingston in recognition of the Bicentennial of the War of 1812. The role of Royal George was played by the brig , one of the last two remaining tall ships with an 1812 heritage.

Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples.Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 98. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I. After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana returned to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under the administration of the French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the Europeans as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, Cameroonian scholars have rediscovered his story. Early life Atangana was born sometime between 1876 and 1885 in Mvoly√©, a small village in what is today Yaound√©, Cameroon.Sources disagree on Atangana's year and place of birth. Ahanda says c. 1883 in Yaound√©; DeLancey and DeLancey, p. 34, say 1885 in Mvoly ; Ngoh, 349, says c. 1882 and gives no birthplace; Nde says c. 1876 in Ongola (an early Beti name for Yaound√©); Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 485, and Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 90, say c. 1880 and give no place of birth. His parents gave him the drum name \\"He who is known by the nations\\".Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 486. He was the eleventh of twelve children born to Essomba Atangana, a headman of the Mvog Atemenge sublineage of the Ewondo ethnic group. Essomba Atangana was one of thousands of minor Beti leaders living between the Sanaga and Nyong rivers, each charged with providing for his compound and the extended family and slaves who lived there.Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 90. His father died when Ntsama Atangana was about six years old. Major Hans Dominik Little is known about Atangana's childhood. Like other Beti boys, he would have learned to fish, hunt, and trap, and would have memorised his family's genealogy and folk wisdom. Explorers from the German Empire appeared near his village in 1887 in search of a direct route to the ivory trade in the savannas to the north. They had claimed Beti lands as part of their Kamerun colony in 1884, and by February 1889 they had established a permanent base in the area, which they named Jaunde after the local people. The Ewondo opposed the foreigners at first, although Atangana was probably not yet old enough to participate in the fighting. After the defeat of Omgba Bissogo in 1895 and others like it, Ewondo resistance waned. The Germans randomly appointed chiefs and mayors to serve under them, and took local youths to perform menial tasks;Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 487. Atangana was among them, sent by his uncle to be a houseboy.Ahanda says this occurred in 1896, but this conflicts with other sources. Ewondo who learned were highly favoured in the early days of the colonial regime. Station commander Hans Dominik sent four such individuals to attend the mission school of the German Pallottine Fathers in Kribi, a settlement on the coast.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 487, says this happened in 1895; Ngoh, 349, and Ahanda say 1896; Nde says 1897. There, Atangana learned German language, history, and geography; mathematics; and Roman Catholicism. Father Heinrich Vieter especially liked the boy,Nde. and Atangana became the first Ewondo baptised a Roman Catholic; he took the Christian name Karl. Atangana's schooling had just ended when members of the Bulu ethnic group, one closely related to the Ewondo, invaded Kribi and sacked the school and church in 1899. Atangana waited out the revolt in Douala with the Fathers until the colonial militia defeated the rebels the following year. Early career In August 1900, the commander of German forces at Victoria (present-day Limbe) appointed Atangana interpreter for 500 Bulu hostages, who were being pressed into labour. Atangana kept the post for six months and took up extra duties as a nurse. The colonisers next sent Atangana to Buea to work as an office clerk. At some point between the end of his schooling in Kribi and the end of his service in Victoria, Atangana met Marie Biloa, a woman from a village called Mekumba. Although she was a little older and living as a kept woman by a German functionary, Atangana married her.Ahanda says he met her in Buea, but Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 487, says he met her in Kribi. She would eventually bear him two children: Jean Ndengue and Katerina (or Catherine) Edzimbi. Atangana was a devout Christian, and he supported the church throughout his life with land and gifts. He opposed popular Beti syncretist practices, and he was an opponent of an Ewondo initiation rite called the Sso; his efforts led to its eventual eradication from Beti society.Matateyou 45. In 1901 he secured land for the Pallottine Fathers to build a mission in Jaunde, thus opening East and South Kamerun to Catholic proselytisation. Nevertheless, Atangana supported traditional Ewondo customs on marriage. On widows, he said, > My colleagues and I . . . can only reply in demanding the upholding of > custom, which requires the widow to be the property of the heir until her > liberation, which can only take effect after the return of her bridewealth. > She must remain with him as long as this return is not made.Quoted in Guyer, > \\"Beti Widow Inheritance\\", 208. Early in 1902, the colonial government appointed him their representative to the Ewondo people, and interpreter and clerk for the Germans posted in Jaunde.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 487; Ngoh 349. He was tasked with organising a census and tax collection system. He chose 300 headmen to be tax collectors, of whom the Germans approved 233. Atangana negotiated a cut of 5% for the collectors, much to their delight. Atangana (foreground, right side) during the German colonial period Hans Dominik became the Jaunde post commander in 1904. For the next six years, Atangana accompanied him on at least fifteen administrative patrols and probative excursions.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 488. Atangana proved an astute diplomat, in one case negotiating with a group of rebellious Manguissa and thus averting a confrontation between the tribesmen and the Germans. Atangana helped open posts in such wide-ranging places as Bafia, Abong-Mbang, Mouloudou, Ngaound√©r√©, Garoua, and Maroua. The Germans largely kept themselves segregated from their African subjects, but Dominik and Atangana defied these standards and grew close, even dining together in the same tent on occasion. Back in Jaunde, Atangana gained responsibilities valued by the regime, such as overseeing a poll tax in October 1908.Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 91. In 1907, members of the Mvog Ada sublineage revolted against the colonial government over Atangana's appointment as their official interpreter. The plot included a conspiracy to poison Atangana, but word leaked to him. He informed his masters, and on 11 April, six plotters were put to death and two others imprisoned.Ngoh 111. Dominik died on 16 November 1910. That same year, Atangana returned to Jaunde and received an administrative post, perhaps as head of the Ewondo-Bane court, which presided over civil disputes and small claims and was the conduit through which the Germans transmitted communiqu√©s (and gauged the response to them).Ahanda and Nde say he was made paramount chief of the Ewondo and Bane at this time. However, Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 98, says that he was given a court appointment. Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 489, on the other hand, places the court appointment in 1913 or later. However, he resigned the post when the head of his sublineage died; Atangana took over as headman of the sublineage and Mvoly√© village.Ngoh 349. In late 1911, Atangana voyaged to Germany to teach Ewondo at the Colonial Institute of the University of Hamburg. He stayed there for about one year and transcribed Ewondo history and folklore for translation into German. His writings eventually became the Jaunde-Texte, an important source document on Ewondo history and culture. In 1913, he met Kaiser Wilhelm II in Germany and Pope Pius X in Rome. He returned to Kamerun the following year.Ahanda. Paramount chief Atangana as paramount chief The Germans had seen some success in uniting disparate groups under single individuals called paramount chiefs (Oberh√§uptlinge). Atangana was chosen for this position among the Ewondo and Bane either before his trip to Germany or soon after.Ahanda and Nde place this event in 1911; Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 489, and Quinn \\"Beti\\", 98, say 25 March 1914. This was technically only a temporary appointment; his subjects would have to approve it a year later to make it permanent. They had little alternative; Atangana was already the primary conduit of information to and from the Germans.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 489. Some emulation of European manners and dress was expected of all chiefs,Guyer 596. but Atangana seems to have genuinely preferred European styles to African ones. He endeavoured to fit himself into the German mould of an ideal administrator. He wrote, \\"To dare to approach the Germans it is necessary to abandon the traits which displease them, to become their friend and then be valued by them.\\"Quoted in Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 98. Accordingly, Atangana ate German food; formed a European- style, 20-piece orchestra; and ordered a large, Germanic mansion to be built. This latter project requiring construction of a brickyard and sawmill and earned Atangana another epithet, Mindili Ebulu, \\"the man whose house is so large that it had a roof divided into nine sections instead of the two sections of an ordinary dwelling.\\" The number nine has great significance in Beti folklore.Quinn, \\"Songs\\", 34. Atangana was suspicious of anyone who might supplant him as the Germans' favourite. He wrote, > A number of persons who associated themselves with Europeans and proved > themselves useful to white people achieved positions in the native society > through fraud and extortion. But the Europeans, having noticed it, stopped > it. They could discern natives of the noble class by their loyalty and > honesty.Quoted in Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 488. Atangana won over other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and intervention on their behalf.Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 99. He lavished attention on visitors from out of town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained a substantial amount of wealth.DeLancey and DeLancey 35. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 550 note 13. The paramount chief maintained some loyalty for his subjects. He persuaded the Germans to carry out infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider. Atangana's appointment irritated members of the Bulu ethnic group. They feared they might one day lose German favour, or worse yet, fall under the dominion of the Ewondo. This culminated in the 1912 Bulu uprising led by Martin-Paul Samba, a German-trained man much like Atangana. The rebellion was crushed and Samba executed.Ngoh 114. World War I The Allied West African Campaign of World War I reached Kamerun in 1914. Douala fell on 17 September, and the Germans regrouped at Jaunde. Beti informants alerted Atangana as to the Allies' progress, and as the loss of Jaunde seemed inevitable, Atangana prepared to escape with his masters.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 490. He and the chiefs under him gave their posts to weaker relatives so they could more easily take them back should the Germans return. They held out in Jaunde until 1 January 1916, when troops of the British Army captured the town,Ngoh 126. and the German soldiers and missionaries fled into the forest. Atangana and 72 Ewondo and Bane chiefs, along with 14‚Äì20,000 villagers (mostly soldiers and their families), led them through.Higonnet 151; Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 101. A Beti folk song, \\"Atangana Ntsama, the War Is Over\\", tells of the retreat and shows the conflict between those Beti who supported Atangana and those who opposed him: :Atangana Ntsama, the war is over . . . :H√®! Atangana Ntsama, the war is over! :The cannon are broken, :Go tell it to the son of Ndono Edoa, :To the great man who is the son of Ndono Edoa, :Run quickly, why do you languish there? :All you Ewondo, come and run quickly, :Come and run quickly, brothers; :Go tell it to Mindili Ebulu, son of Ndono Edoa. :How is it that you would like me to leave so many goods behind? :H√®! They will surprise you in your greed! :Such richness. I should take some! :You others, move off, what are you doing there? :Friend, there were as many goods as in a market; :Friend, we have marched through all of that without taking anything!Quoted in Quinn, \\"Songs\\", 34. They reached Spanish Guinea in February and surrendered to the unaligned representatives of Spain under the Restoration. The Spanish government of √Ålvaro Figueroa Torres gave the Beti land to settle and agreed to transport the Germans to the nearby island of Fernando Po. Atangana and members of his family accompanied them. In 1918, the Germans sent Atangana and six other chiefs to Spain, where they would witness if necessary that the Germans had treated their African subjects humanely.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 491. In September 1919, Atangana had an audience with King Alfonso XIII of Spain and urged him to support the Germans in these proceedings. Atangana remained in Madrid for two years and stayed a month in Barcelona to retrieve money he had deposited through the Basel Mission.Quinn, \\"Rain Forest\\", 102. Meanwhile, Ewondo lands came under the administration of the French Third Republic under a League of Nations mandate. Atangana, now known by the French version of his name, Charles, wrote the French government to swear his allegiance and demand readmittance to his homeland. He received his wish in June 1920 and arrived in Douala on 28 November 1920.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 491; Ahanda. Later life Atangana's unfailing loyalty and subservience to Germany prevented the French from ever fully trusting him. His first task under the new colonial regime was to supervise gangs of forced road-construction labourers in the town of Dschang. In Atangana's absence, the French had appointed a Beti headman named Joseph Atemengue as their local representative in Jaunde (now known by the French spelling, Yaound√©). However, Atemengue never enjoyed the popularity Atangana had among the Beti. Atangana tried to secure an alliance with him by sending his 20-year-old, German- educated daughter, Katerina, to marry him, but she eventually fled from the much older Atemengue and back to her father. Atangana's work performance convinced the French to let him return to Yaound√© in late 1921 or early 1922.Ahanda says 26 November, but Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 491, says December. Soon thereafter, Atemengue was made chief of the local court, and Atangana was again appointed paramount chief (chef sup√©rieur).Ahanda places these events in early 1922, but Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", says December 1921. He received a seat on the Council of Notables, a body the French had introduced to act as liaisons to their subjects and advisors to the administration.Fanso 349. Atangana set up a cabinet based on those he had observed in Spain, but he never allowed it to do much, and its members were not accustomed to European-style administration. It disbanded in 1925.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 492. The French granted the chiefs significantly less power than had their German predecessors. Atangana's major role was simple: to enforce the dictats of French rule.Geschiere 154. Governor General Van Vollenhoven wrote in 1917 that, \\"the chiefs have no power of their own of any kind because there are not two authorities in the circle: French authority and indigenous authority; there is only one. Only the commander of the circle commands.\\"Quoted in Geschiere 154. As a colonial administrator, Atangana was expected to collect taxes, help the French introduce cocoa and coffee plantations, and mobilise chiefs to secure the labour to work these estates. In 1924, the French introduced a requisition system to procure food for the Yaound√© urban community and for rail labourers; Atangana was responsible for rallying the chiefs to gather the necessary provisions from rural farmers; the exact methods used by the chiefs was left to them.Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 581, 583. Cocoa production in the South and Centre provinces increased even during the Great Depression, partially as a result of these efforts.Austen and Derrick 167. He reorganised the chiefs and their duties and tried to Westernise his subjects by encouraging them to wear European-style clothing, use new building methods and house styles, and work to improve roads. Most of the chiefs respected Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power.Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 584. A new system of status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. The entire class recognised its reliance on the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 584‚Äì5. Nevertheless, the Beti at large detested French forced labour practices and taxes. Some people fled to the bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out- of-town visitors or waiting until the last minute to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour.Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 589. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers. Nevertheless, his wealth continued to grow. In 1922, his salary was 6,000 francs per year, and in 1938, it had risen to 24,000 francs per year. Atangana also received 2% of all taxes collected by lower chiefs, pay for his legal role, and stipends for organising road construction. Oral informants have reported that as early as 1924, he owned enormous plantations with as much as 1 km2 of cocoa, 1.1 km2 of palms, 5 km2 of food crops, and 500 head of livestock. The amounts may be exaggerated, but Atangana was by all accounts a wealthy man.Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 595 and 595 note 78. Iliffe 221 reports that he had five square kilometres of oil palms and a square kilometre of cocoa trees at this time. He owned two lorries and a car by 1926, which he used to haul produce from his plantations. By the 1930s, important chiefs such as Atangana could earn more than 400,000 francs per year on tax collecting alone. The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control began to oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell especially among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, \\"We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For all the things that we have sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, we have received nothing.\\"R. Buell, The Native Problem, 327, quoted in Guyer, \\"Food Economy\\", 589.\\" They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana still head of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed. In 1925, the French reduced the number of Beti chiefs to 40 and removed the chiefs of Yaound√© from Atangana's direct control. However, in 1928 the Yaound√© chiefs were deemed quarrelsome and incompetent, and Atangana was once again placed over them. In 1929, he wrote a work on traditional Beti society in which he tried to hide his unremarkable childhood by taking the title of \\"King\\" and claiming descent from a fictitious line of Ewondo royalty.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 488‚Äì9. By the end of the decade, he was the head of perhaps 130,000 people, the chief of Mvoly√© village, and the supervisor of eight sectional chiefs and 72 village chiefs. In reality, his position was one of prestige but little actual power.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 493 Collecting taxes and finding labour grew increasingly difficult as the decade progressed, thanks to greater access to paying employment in Yaound√© and on the plantations.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 493‚Äì4. Atangana's 1938 proposal for the reorganisation of Yaound√©'s administration shows the frustration he experienced at that time: > the local people do not know what endurance means . . . [and] work with ill- > will for the administration or for private concerns, where they seek refuge > as a safeguard when the administration gives the chiefs an order in the > public interest or for their own good.Quoted in Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 493. He further complained, \\"Notables, with their diminished influence, are almost inert in relation to the growing number of their recalcitrant subjects\\" and suggested that a chief could hardly control more than 5,000 people.Quoted in Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 494. Atangana is not even mentioned in a French report on their African leaders from 1939. However, he retained the right to announce the appointment of new chiefs and to claim that both he and the French had selected them.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 494. Atangana travelled frequently in the French colonial period. He made a point of attending his subjects' weddings and funerals, for example. He had more opportunities to visit Europe, including the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and the French Colonial Conference in 1935. In 1938, his wife died. Atangana was a handsome man by Ewondo standards: strong, well groomed, with a reputation as a good fighter, dancer, and husband.Iliffe 103. He remarried on 6 January 1940 to Julienne or Yuliana Ngonoa, a young Beti woman of the Mvog Manga sublineage from the village Nkolafamba. She bore him two children: Marie-Th√©r√®se and Ren√© Gr√©goire.Ahanda; Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 494. Atangana seems to have adhered to Catholic strictures against polygamy, despite the fact that other Beti chiefs at the time had several hundred wives.Geschiere 170 note 10. Atangana lobbied in his later life for public health causes, such as the eradication of sleeping sickness. He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule.Quinn, \\"Atangana\\", 495. Atangana's health began to fail him beginning in August 1943. On 1 September, he died in Mvoly√©, Yaound√©. Legacy Charles Atangana statue in Yaounde No one took over as paramount chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional Cameroonian chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, Cameroonian ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Th√©r√®se became the new Ewondo paramount chief.Diagnostic 17. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaound√©, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francs CFA.\\"Le Ch√¢teau Charles Atangana sera enfin sauv√©\\". Beautiful surroundings of the Charles Atangana Monument The colonialism that Atangana had supported was ruinous in Cameroon. Production centred on enriching the chiefs, wooing of foreign investment, and the apparatus of colonial administration, and building only that infrastructure that would aid in the transport and export of cash crops.Guyter, \\"Food Economy\\", 597. Nevertheless, Atangana's story became part of Beti folklore. For example, Beti storytellers related his tale in oral poems and songs that took up to a full night to recite.Alexandre 2. His legacy was largely forgotten by the nation at large between his death and Cameroonian independence. However, the nationalist scholarship that blossomed after Cameroon's independence in 1960 resurrected his story. Charles Atangana Avenue in downtown Yaound√© is named for him.West 171. A statue in his likeness tops a hill nearby, which had fallen into disrepair by 2000.Asombang 26. NotesReferences *Ahanda, Marie-Th√©r√®se Assiga (2003): \\"Charles Atangana\\". Bonaberi.com.

Early in her first term she assembled a broad group of stakeholders into a forum called the Sustainable Business Initiative, one of whose recommendations was to create the city's Sustainability Commission, which Council officially created in 2007. In 2005 Piercy became an early signatory of the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement. over 900 mayors had signed the Agreement.  Eugene issues  West Eugene EmX = Piercy supported the west Eugene extension of Lane Transit District's bus rapid transit system, having voted for it in her capacity as city representative to the regional Metropolitan Planning Commission. All local jurisdictions have been proponents of the EmX system for over a decade. Two segments were completed and were successful. This mass transit system is built into all local planning documents. It is designed to be efficient and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Opponents to the project include citizens and business owners who say that the bus system is too expensive, is not needed, and will cause many businesses to lose business or have to close because of the construction. Proponents include local elected bodies, Lane Transit District, community members and the Eugene Chamber of Commerce. = Proposed city tax for schools = While Piercy was mayor, a local income tax to fund schools was proposed, but defeated. =Pledge of Allegiance controversy= While Piercy was mayor, a proposal to have Eugene council members begin saying the pledge of allegiance prior to council meetings on days of national patriotic importance was passed.

It was the first ship of the , which was the first operational submarine class in the world to use air-independent propulsion in the form of Stirling engines which use liquid oxygen and diesel as the propellant. It was built by Kockums, launched in 1995, and subsequently commissioned in 1996. In 2015, Sweden's Defense Material Administration (FMV) signed a contract with Saab Kockums which included a mid-life upgrade of two members of the Gotland class, Gotland and Halland, for SEK 2.1 billion. Gotland is expected to return to the FMV in late 2018 following a series of platform and combat systems upgrades. Construction The submarine Gotland was designed and built by Kockums in Malm√∂ and launched on 2 February 1995. The honor guard during the launching consisted of the amphibian company of the F√•r√∂sund Marine Brigade (FMB). Participants from Gotland included the Governor, the Municipal Council chairman, the commander of the Gotland Military Command and the commander of FMB. The submarine is essentially based on the V√§sterg√∂tland-class submarine, but with a lot of improvements. It has two diesel engines and two Stirling engines which gives air independence and doubled endurance compared with previous submarine types. A gas cycle drives a generator that charges the submarines battery which is connected to the propeller engine. For passive reconnaissance, she is equipped with circular sonar and flank array sonar.  Mid-life Upgrade  In 2020, HSwMS Gotland did undergo a mid-life upgrade, as her sister HSwMS Uppland before her. During the upgrade, a numer of sytems that will be used in the next generation submarines, the Blekinge-class (A26), was installed. More than 20 new systems on-board the new Gotland-class was implemented, which contributes to their de-risking for the A26. This also offers training opportunities for the crew when they in the future deploy onboard the A26. The upgrade process entails many new systems, such as the Stirling AIP, a complete new mast suite, sonars and sensors as well as management and communication systems. In order to host all systems, the submarine has gained length to 62 m and another 200 ton in weight, to erach a deplacement (surfaced) of 1580 tons.  Lease to the United States Navy  In 2004, the Swedish Government received a request from the United States of America to lease Gotland‚ÄîSwedish-flagged, commanded, and manned‚Äîfor one year for use in anti-submarine warfare exercises. The Swedish Government granted this request in October 2004, with both navies signing a memorandum of understanding on 21 March 2005. Gotland was loaded on board the Norwegian semi-submersible heavy-lift ship, MV Eide Transporter, on 10 May 2005, for a month-long voyage over the Atlantic Ocean and through the Panama Canal to Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California, where it arrived on 27 June 2005. After a couple weeks of getting accustomed to the new environment, the exercises with United States Third Fleet began on 18 July 2005. The lease was extended for another 12 months in 2006. Gotland managed to penetrate the defensive measures of Carrier Strike Group 7 undetected and snap several pictures of during the December pre-deployment Joint Task Force Exercise 06-2 (JTFEX 06-2) in the Pacific Ocean (probably in the California Operating Areas), effectively \\"sinking\\" the aircraft carrier. The exercise was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the US Fleet against modern diesel-electric submarines, which some have noted as severely lacking. In July 2007, Gotland departed San Diego for Sweden. Raid against Kockums In the early morning of 8 April 2014, the Defence Materiel Administration, known as FMV, with the help of the Swedish Army, raided the Kockums shipyard in Malm√∂, Sweden, then owned by German defense giant ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. The goal of the mission was to confiscate material belonging to the Swedish state, especially hardware relating to the Stirling engines used in HSwMS Gotland. Although the raid was performed by armed military forces it was not violent. After Kockums employees locked the gates blocking FMV's exit with the confiscated material, a long drawn-out negotiation ensued. A compromise was finally struck in which the hardware was to be stored at a shared secure area until further notice. Since FMV was only interested in the hardware rather than the blueprints, the show of force was more likely part of a long political confrontation between the State of Sweden and the owners of Kockums, rather than an attempt at discouraging espionage. Later in 2014, Kockums was sold to Saab Group. Gallery File:Gotland DN-SD-06-07476.JPEGHSwMS Gotland onboard MV Eide Transporter in San Diego.

Frank Baum and his successors. It was written by Eloise Jarvis McGraw and Lauren McGraw Wagner (her married name was dropped from reprinted editions after the marriage ended). It was illustrated by Dick Martin. Merry Go Round in Oz is the last of the \\"Famous Forty\\" and the last \\"official\\" Oz book. Reilly & Lee had declined offers from many other writers, including previous author Rachel R. Cosgrove, to publish a fortieth Oz book because of poor sales, but were persuaded by McGraw's two Newbery Awards to admit a fortieth book into the series. The first edition, the so-called \\"white edition,\\" is the rarest book in the series in its original printings. Synopsis Halidom and Troth are two adjacent principalities within the Land of Oz, both resembling medieval kingdoms. Heir to the throne of Halidom is Prince Gules. The people of Halidom have always derived their physical and mental abilities from three golden circlets worn by their ruler: the first around his forehead, the second on his right forearm, the third on his right thumb. The first circlet confers intelligence upon all the citizens of Halidom, the second confers physical strength and fighting prowess; the third confers manual dexterity and craftsmanship. The first and third circlets have been lost before the beginning of the book, with attendant loss of abilities by the subjects of Halidom. Fess is a young pageboy in the household of Prince Gules, but Fess was born in Troth, so the circlets have no effect on him. Awakening one day to discover that all the natives of Halidom are strangely languid, Fess learns that the second (and last remaining) circlet has been stolen. He embarks on a quest with Prince Gules, aided by a unicorn and a Flittermouse (a mouse with wings) to retrieve all three. Meanwhile, Dorothy Gale and the Cowardly Lion temporarily leave the Emerald City to place an order with the Easter Bunny, whose underground domain is conveniently accessible from Oz. Having placed the order, they get lost on the way back, and meet and join the Prince and Fess in their quest. Robin Brown, an orphan from Oregon, USA, rides a magic merry-go- round horse to the Land of Oz. The horse whisks him to the Quadling and Munchkin Countries of Oz, where Robin has adventures in View Halloo (a region dedicated to fox-hunting) and Roundabout (a land where everything is round, inhabited by Roundheads). The Roundheads mistake him for a new king foretold by a prophecy, and force him to remain there and serve as their king. Dorothy's party happens on Roundabout and help Robin to escape. Eventually, Robin must help find the missing magic circlets of Halidom.

Information He wrote and illustrated The Ozmapolitan of Oz, published in 1986. It and three previous Oz books published by the club were produced in an 8.5 x 11 format at his request so that he could draw fewer illustrations. The size format was unpopular with fans, and in 2006, they were reissued in a format closer to that of the other Oz books. In addition to books, he designed greeting cards, post cards, and posters. While His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz was eventually recovered in the 1990s for the American Home Entertainment VHS release, he designed new opening titles for His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz in which he incorrectly, according to Michael Patrick Hearn, proclaimed that L. Frank Baum was the director. These title cards appear on all current releases of the film, as the originals do not survive. He was co-author of The Oz Scrapbook (1977) and was an active Oz fan, serving as The International Wizard of Oz Club as president, vice-president, director, and editor of its magazine, The Baum Bugle.

Soheil Abedian of the Sunland Group visited the House of Versace in 1997 to propose the idea of a Versace branded hotel. He claims Palazzo Versace Gold Coast to be the first fashion-branded hotel. On his reasons for approaching Versace, Abedian says \\"Gianni Versace was a lover of architecture in the first place, a person who used in his fashion all the elements of the Baroque style. ... Also, Versace was the only fashion house at the time that had a home collection and everything that a hotel needed from the porcelain to cutlery, pillows to fabric.\\" The main building was designed in Postmodern architecture style in a broad interpretation of Neoclassical architecture. In 2005, Emirates International Holdings acquired 50% of Palazzo Versace Gold Coast at the same time entering into a joint venture to develop a chain of hotels including a similar hotel in Dubai.

Early years and military career The son of Jozef Grzegorz Mikolaj Piotr Taczanowski and Franciszka Drweska, as a youth Taczanowski was influenced by Polish poet and national hero Adam Mickiewicz, who lived at Chory≈Ñ in 1831 while Prussian authorities prevented him from returning to Russian-Poland to support the insurrection there. Originally a Prussian officer, Taczanowski resigned to participate in the Greater Poland Uprising 1846 and in the 1848 revolt against Austrian-Polish rule. Following the collapse of this planned military action, he served with Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Italian Risorgimento. Wounded, he was placed in French captivity, but he was later released and served as a General in the 1863 Polish revolt against Russian rule. With the collapse of this action and Czarist suppression of the revolution, Taczanowski fled to France and then to Turkey, where he unsuccessfully attempted to find support for the creation of a Polish liberation army and the establishment of an independent Polish state. Under an amnesty, the Prussian government allowed his return to Chory≈Ñ in 1870 where he remained with his family until his death nine years later. Today, his grave is considered a site of Polish national honour. The manor of Chory≈Ñ is now a historic landmark bearing plaques in remembrance of both Taczanowski and Mickiewicz.

Cosgrove, The Hidden Valley of Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1951; p. 120. Cosgrove, however, takes pains to cast her own child protagonist, Jam, in a more realistic vein. He often expresses fear at the strange goings-on and creatures around him, and longs to return to his home and parents; his part in the denouement of the plot is fairly modest.Hidden Valley, pp. 113, 118, and ff.

Cosgrove even offers oblique acknowledgement that Jam's parents miss him and worry about him through his days-long absence -- a rare element in the Oz literature.

In addition to Jam, neophyte author Cosgrove provides a range of new characters, including living books and snowmen, a mean-spirited giant, and a rhyming dictionary that spouts verse; but her most striking creations are Percy the white rat and the Leopard with the Changeable Spots.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 107, 128, 158, 178-9, 210. Cosgrove chose Percy based on her experience in laboratory work; she considered lab rats \\"fascinating\\" and \\"clever.\\"Rachel R. Cosgrove, The Hidden Valley of Oz, Kinderhook, IL, International Wizard of Oz Club, 1991; Afterword, p. 316. Percy, who calls himself \\"the personality kid,\\" is an extrovert, a classic American wise guy; he calls everyone \\"kiddo.\\" Cosgrove liked the character enough to use him again, in her second Oz book, The Wicked Witch of Oz, and in a short story, \\"Percy and the Shrinking Violet.\\"Rachel Cosgrove Payes, \\"Percy and the Shrinking Violet,\\" Oz-story Magazine, No. 1 (June 1995), pp. 4-16. The great visual and esthetic triumph in the book, though, is the Leopard with the Changeable Spots. (The other characters call him \\"Spots\\" for short.) As his title indicates, the markings on his coat change, both randomly and in response to his feelings. They shift \\"from pink diamonds, to violet hearts, to spinning pinwheels; and so on and on...from golden snow flakes to silver crosses,\\" plus \\"green apples\\" and \\"pink elephants,\\" \\"red dots\\" and \\"big, black exclamation marks,\\" \\"blue moons\\" and \\"electric lights.\\"Hidden Valley, pp. 129, 133, 155, 167, 189. When he's in doubt, he produces \\"blue question marks,\\" and when he is angry he has \\"brightly colored swords and muskets spinning madly on his back.\\"Hidden Valley, pp. 138, 153. His uniqueness has made the Leopard an outcast and a pariah in the jungle; but he fits right in with the unusual beings who are Dorothy's companions, is welcomed among them, and is grateful for their acceptance. Cosgrove used the Leopard again too, in her story \\"Spots in Oz.\\"Rachel Cosgrove Payes, \\"Spots in Oz,\\" Oz-story Magazine, No. 3 (July 1997), pp. 65-75. Synopsis Jonathan Andrew Manley, nicknamed Jam, is a boy from Ohio, the son of a biologist. At the start of the story, he is building a \\"collapsible kite\\" from plans he found in a popular magazine. Rather than cutting the pieces of his wooden frame to match the plans, however, he scales up the kite to match the size of his wood, yielding an extra-large result. The size of the thing inspires him to try to fly on it; he attaches a shipping crate, and gathers up three of his father's experimental animals (two guinea pigs and a white lab rat). A strong gust of wind lifts kite, crate, and passengers into the sky; Jam is on his way to Oz. Kite and crate thump down the next day, in the purple landscape of the Gillikin Country. Jam is amazed to find that his animals can now talk; the guinea pigs call themselves Pinny and Gig, while the white rat introduces himself as Percy. Jam meets some of the inhabitants, who inform him of local conditions. This remote valley of Oz is dominated by a wrathful giant, fifty feet tall, called Terp the Terrible, who enslaves the common people to work in his vineyards and his jam-making factory. Terp captures Jam, and is struck by his name; the giant threatens to spread the boy on his breakfast muffins the next day, and eat him. Terp imprisons the boy and his animals in the highest tower of his castle. The courtyard of Terp's castle contains a magic muffin tree, guarded by a fierce monster (it has an elephant's body, alligator's tail, and two heads, a nocturnal owl and a diurnal wolf). In the night, Percy is able to help Jam and friends escape the tower, with the aid of a handy grapevine. Jam and his pets flee, though Percy doubles back to steal one of the magic muffins. On the Gillikin plains, Jam and friends are menaced by the Equinots, hostile centaurs; Percy frightens away the Equinots when he eats some of the magic muffin, and grows to ten times his normal size. A local farmer and his wife provide shelter for the night; Pinny and Gig, who have little taste for adventure, decide to stay at the farm as pets of the farmer's children. Another kite flight takes Jam and Percy to the tin castle of the Emperor of the Winkies, the Tin Woodman. There, the party is soon joined by Dorothy Gale, the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Hungry Tiger.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 46, 58-9, 98-9, 186-7, 214. After hearing Jam's tale, the assembled party decide to defeat Terp and free the oppressed Gillikins. Their path from the Winkie Country to the Gillikin lands leads through a wilderness; a commotion in the jungle brings them a new friend, the Leopard with the Changeable Spots. They enter Bookville, where a hostile King and court condemn them to be pressed into books. (The animated books resemble the playing cards in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The idea of changing size by eating a food also links the two works.) Percy gnaws the travelers a way out of their bookshelf prison during the night. Another disagreeable adventure awaits them in Icetown; to escape an igloo prison, the Scarecrow volunteers his stuffing as kindling for a fire. (The Scarecrow made a similar sacrifice to placate the Hip-po-gy-raf in The Tin Woodman of Oz.) The travelers, with a re-stuffed Scarecrow, eventually reach the Gillikin Country and the Hidden Valley. Percy's shrinking-and-growing experiences with the magic muffin have made them realize that Terp needs a steady supply of muffins to maintain his giant stature. Jam and company, with local collaboration, lure Terp away from his castle, and hypnotize the guardian beast into harmlessness; The Tin Man chops down the magic tree, killing it. Terp is trapped in the smokestack of the jam factory until he shrinks to his normal size. The party travel to the Emerald City, where Jam is welcomed as a hero; after a celebratory banquet, Ozma and the Wizard send the boy home to Ohio once more. Percy remains in Oz, and convinces the Wizard to enchant him into his large size permanently. \\\\---- Cosgrove originally intended to have Jam travel to Oz by rocket, but the publishers informed her that that had already been done in The Yellow Knight of Oz. Cosgrove's original opening was published posthumously in an issue of Oz-story Magazine.Rachel Cosgrove Payes, \\"Rocket Trip to Oz,\\" Oz-story Magazine, No. 6 (September 2000), pp. 180-1. She later gave an account of how she wrote and revised Hidden Valley and worked with the personnel at Reilly & Lee. Her article appeared in The Baum Bugle,Rachel Cosgrove Payes, \\"Timetable for an Oz Book,\\" Baum Bugle, Vol. 35 No. 1 (Spring 1991), pp. 17-18. and was later included as an Afterword in the 1991 edition of Hidden Valley. Cogrove began work on a second Oz book soon after finishing the first; but Reilly & Lee declined it, due to low sales for Oz books in the 1950s. The work would finally appear in print forty years later.

As with other noir and pulp characters, both protagonists and antagonists of 100 Bullets are deeply flawed.  The Trust Notable members=Augustus Medici First appeared in issue #5. The Trust's most powerful member. Augustus is the de facto leader of the thirteen families and has plans to bring peace to the rivalries that plague the Trust. Since the death of Daniel Peres, Augustus became even more powerful and has consolidated his position by removing the Peres family from power. Other family heads are now plotting against him. Through Shepherd, Augustus monitored Graves and his schemes, as well as his son. Later events have forced him to deal directly with Graves and accede to Lono's suggestion to pardon Kotias and Vasco for their participation in a failed scheme to assassinate him. It seems that his power is ever increasing, with all the remaining houses dominated by his position. It seems that he had an agreement with Graves and Vasco about protecting Rothstein. It is eventually revealed that Augustus, Graves and Vasco were the masterminds behind a decades-long plan to assume control of the Trust, a plot which drove most of the series' events and many characters' motives. With the death of Vasco, both Augustus and Graves agreed to a sit down with the remaining houses, with Augustus prepared to discuss the terms of what he termed his \\"surrender\\" to the newly aligned Trust power of Megan Dietrich, Tibo Vermeer, and Joan D'Arcy. Augustus then negotiated the appointment of the House of Vasco to Agent Graves, before stepping down to hand the House of Medici to his son, Benito. In issue #100, Benito is killed by the remaining houses, minus Graves. Graves confronts Augustus, stating that he knew his actions would lead to his son's death, but before this can be confirmed, it is revealed Lono is in Augustus' chair. After Dizzy shoots Lono, Graves executes the unarmed Augustus. Benito Medici First appeared in issue #20. Augustus' son and heir apparent, mentored by Mr. Shepherd, Benito is a spoiled and reckless young man with a seeming excess of luck who is more interested in gambling than in his responsibilities towards life or the future of the Trust. A botched attempt made on his life on the orders of Fulvio Carlito, as well as Mr. Shepherd's death later on, led him to reassess his priorities. He was pursued by Megan Dietrich but appeared enamored of Dizzy Cordova, whom he tracked down to Mexico. There, he spent time living with Dizzy, Wylie Times and Mr. Branch. After his incapacitation at the hands of Victor Ray and an interrogation by Lono, Benito was reminded of his importance within the Medici Family, and to the Trust at large. Returning to the Medici estate in Florida, Benito seemed to have given his future inheritance more thought. He ordered Lono to capture a Minuteman as a gift for his father; however when Lono returned with a beaten and bound Dizzy Cordova, Benito shot Lono in the face: an attempt to kill his own family's warlord. Benito then tended to Dizzy's injuries. After Javier Vasco's assassination, Augustus returned home to meet with the remaining leaders of the Trust, from the houses of Dietrich, Vermeer and D'Arcy. The meeting resulted in Augustus' removal of himself from power, and the elevation of Benito to head of the House of Medici. Benito was then immediately found strangled and drowned to death in issue #100. Graves claims Benito's death was engineered intentionally by his father and the younger Trust did it, but it is also hinted that Lono killed him in revenge for Benito's shooting his face. Megan Dietrich First appeared in issue #4. The series' femme fatale; a charming, confident yet deadly member of the Trust. Megan had risen to become the head of the Los Angeles-based Dietrich family, also running the family securities firm following the death of her father. A seemingly staunch supporter of the House of Medici and a close friend of Augustus, Megan had a hidden agenda and was not above murder to protect her own interests, also displaying more than a passing interest in Benito Medici. Megan was shot in an intentionally unsuccessful assassination attempt by Victor in San Diego (in issue #66). Soon after, she consummated a deeper partnership with Augustus Medici, who was able to convince Megan to not seek retribution for the attempt on her life. Megan's relationship with Augustus appeared to be headed towards a possible marriage, but the relationship was terminated by Augustus. Megan then teamed up with Vermeer and D'Arcy as they plotted against Medici and Graves to realign the Trust under her leadership. In issue #99, she was seen seducing Benito (the brand new head of the house of Medici) in the pool where he would be found dead in the next issue. She was shown to be possibly both racist and sexist in issue #100, when she reacted to Graves' naming of Dizzy Cordova as the new Agent of the Minutemen. Megan was killed in an explosion engineered by Cole Burns (which also ultimately claimed his life as well) in issue #100. Roland Dietrich First appeared in issue #69 (in a flashback). Roland was Megan's father and the Head of the House of Dietrich around the time of the Atlantic City incident. He was present in the 1962 meeting at which he and Axel Nagel approved Graves's ascension to the role of Agent and leader of the Minutemen. He voted in favor of the Trust's dissolution of the Minutemen, on the advice of Graves and despite his reservations. Ultimately, this led to his capture and brutal execution at the hands of the Minutemen in Atlantic City. Javier Vasco First appeared in issue #25. Javier Vasco's Seattle-based family has historically been viewed as aggressors within the Trust. They have had problems with the Nagel family which were dealt with by the Minutemen, but a rivalry was still evident. Javier was seemingly quite suspicious of the intentions of the House of Medici in restructuring the Trust and eliminating the Minutemen. He had formed a trio of dissent along with Helena Kotias and Fulvio Carlito, planning to eliminate Augustus Medici with the apparent agreement of Graves, in return for his reinstitution. Javier persuaded Axel Nagel to commit suicide, apparently as a consequence of some obligation. It was recently revealed that Augustus, Graves and Vasco were the masterminds behind a decades-long grand plan that is only now becoming clear, which included Vasco feinting the opposition role. He was eliminated by Will Slaughter in issue #98, who was contracted for the hit by Joan D'Arcy. His House is eventually handed over to Graves in the Trust's realignment. Helena Kotias First appeared in issue #25. Based in Aspen, Colorado, Helena was unhappy with the leadership of the Trust. She was part of the alliance between the Kotias, Carlito and Vasco families determined to remove Augustus Medici from power. The trio met with Agent Graves, offering him to reinstitute the Minutemen in exchange for his help. It appeared that Helena was a very close ally of Javier Vasco and Lono even referred to her House as a wing of the House of Vasco. Killed by Victor in issue #86 along with another Trust head, Constance Von Hagen. Mia Simone First appeared in issue #24. Based in Dallas, she was another ally of Medici. Graves considered the Simones to be the weakest of the families of the Trust. Mia was close to both Megan Dietrich and the late Daniel Peres, and seemed dismissive of the aggressive influence of the Vasco family within their organisation. She was killed in issue #76 in a fatal fall mysteriously arranged by Remi Rome. Tibo Vermeer First appeared in issue #25. Based in Omaha, Nebraska, it was first speculated that the House of Vermeer was in alliance with the House of Vasco after Vermeer and Javier Vasco approached Lars Nagel in issue #72. Vermeer's true allegiances and motivations are unclear, but seem to be largely based in self-preservation. He was last seen with Megan and D'Arcy, preparing to sit down with Graves and Augustus. He is killed by Cole Burns in issue #100. Daniel Peres First appeared in issue #23. Daniel Peres was head of the Peres family and powerful within the Trust. During a summit meeting, Peres delivered a message to Augustus Medici from Graves. Peres tried hard to prevent a war between the former close friends, but was killed by Cole Burns in issue #25. The House of Peres was then absorbed by the other then-12 families. Peres was killed on the same bench in Atlantic City as Mr. Branch would later be. Anwar Madrid First appeared in issue #25. Based in New Orleans. Father of Rose Madrid and a supporter of Augustus Medici in the elimination of the Minutemen, Anwar also had a personal ax to grind against the Trust's former soldiers because of Wylie's doomed relationship with Rose and her subsequent death. Wylie Times killed Anwar Madrid (in issue #56) shortly after being reactivated as a Minuteman. Rose Madrid First appeared in issue #52 (in a flashback). Daughter of Anwar Madrid and heiress to the House of Madrid, Rose was also secretly romantically involved with Minuteman Wylie Times. This relationship, which broke the rules of both the Trust and the Minutemen, was doomed due to Rose's involvement with a conspiracy against the House of Medici. Rose was executed by Wylie upon Shepherd's orders, causing a rift between the two men. Rose's relationship with Wylie and her death was one of several reasons why the Trust voted in favor of eliminating the Minutemen. It was revealed in a flashback that Rose's plot against Medici was being manipulated by someone within the Trust, which prompted Wylie to agree to Graves' plan to fake the deaths of the Minutemen. Fulvio Carlito First appeared in issue #25. Fulvio Carlito had been openly critical of the direction in which the Trust was heading. He had formed an alliance with the Kotias and Vasco families to terminate Augustus Medici. The trio induced Agent Graves to not interfere with the achievement of their goals. It was revealed that Carlito was behind a failed assassination attempt of both Augustus and Benito in Miami. Lono's first overt action as the Trust's new Warlord was to capture and torture Fulvio for information concerning the alliance (in issue #65), and to subsequently to eliminate the House of Carlito upon his death. Axel Nagel First appeared in issue #25. An elder member of the Trust, he seemed as skeptical as Vasco about the abandonment of the Minutemen. His family apparently had disagreements with the Vascos which had to be adjudicated by the Minutemen (presumably in a brutal fashion). He was considered an ally of the House of Medici and his family was based in New York City. Axel was instrumental in approving Graves' elevation as the head of the Minutemen in 1962. This was against the wishes of the Trust's then liaison, Mr. Shore, who distrusted Graves' closeness to the Houses of Medici and Vasco. Axel Nagel died in issue #69 after willingly taking poison given by Vasco, who promised Axel to pass the House of Nagel onto his children rather than fold. Lars and Anna Nagel First appeared in issue #70, they were the twin heirs to the House of Nagel. Before they could decide who will lead the House of Nagel, Anna was deceived by Lono. After Lars finished an unexpected business dinner with Vasco and Vermeer, Lono told Anna that Lars was there trying to ally himself with the men who killed their father. Back at their hotel room, Lars unknowingly drank champagne that Anna spiked with lethal pills. When Lars tells his sister that he had decided that she should assume control over the House of Nagel, Anna tried to stop him from drinking his champagne. Already too late, she swallowed the rest of the pills after her brother's death, an act of suicide. The House of Nagel was absorbed by the other Houses soon after. Sigmar Rhone First appeared in issue #25. Based in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, Sigmar was a loving husband and father as well the head of the House of Rhone. He also had covert extramarital affairs with some of the female members of the Trust. Instantly recognisable by his white beard and love of cigars, he owned a casino, record label, media outlets as well as other business interests. He received confirmation of the duplicity of Graves and other Trust leaders from Megan's bodyguard, Kate (who was another one of Sigmar's sex partners.) Rhone was then forced to witness the cold blooded murder of Kate, as well as his wife and young children by Minutemen Victor Ray and Remi Rome, acting on Agent Graves' behalf. He himself was then executed. Joan D'Arcy First appeared in issue #25. The head of the Chicago-based House of D'Arcy was alleged to be allied to the House of Medici. In the wake of the elimination of eight Trust families, Joan D'Arcy approached retired Minuteman Will Slaughter to perform hits on Abe Rothstein, a covert ops specialist who assisted Agent Graves with intelligence, briefcases and \\"magic bullets\\", as well as Javier Vasco. She has survived two attacks by Remi, and was being targeted by Victor, until Graves called him off. She participated in a sit down with the remaining houses and Graves. She was apparently suffocated by Cole Burns in issue #100. Her name is derived from Joan of Arc.  Constance Von Hagen  First appeared in issue #25. She is killed by Victor in issue #86 along with Helena Kotias. Like Helena, she had a clandestine affair with the late Sigmar Rhone. Although her House's name was not mentioned in the book, Brian Azzarello confirmed the character's family name after the series had drawn to a close. The Minutemen Led by Agent Graves, the Minutemen are seven killing machines who policed The Trust, originally thirteen rich, corrupt, and powerful families. Mr. Shepherd, himself a former Minuteman, held the position of Warlord (liaison between the Trust and the Minutemen) and trained Lono and Wylie personally though it is unknown if he trained the rest. The Minutemen were supposed to be killed off on the Trust's orders - instead, their deaths were faked and the members hypnotically hidden in new lives by Graves and Shepherd. The \\"hibernating\\" Minutemen lived very different lives under widely different identities, some going back to the personal lives had before becoming Minutemen while others took on new identities and lifestyles entirely. The Minutemen could only be \\"reactivated\\" upon hearing a code-word known by Graves, chosen for its uncommonness and specificity to \\"the greatest crime in the history of mankind.\\" Additionally some sort of physical/mental trauma seems to play a role in the reactivation of several Minuteman, as some characters are subjected to extreme circumstances as an apparent part of their \\"waking up.\\" To what exact extent this trauma is tied to the reactivation process (or if it intrinsically is at all) is unknown, as the reader is not explicitly shown every character's specific reactivation process. =The Atlantic City Minutemen=Agent Phillip Graves The main character of much of the series, Agent Philip Graves is a mysterious and enigmatic old man who presents wronged individuals with the opportunity for revenge without consequences. He is first introduced in the eight-page story in the 1998 Vertigo Winter special \\"Silencer Night\\", before appearing in 100 Bullets issue #1. Graves is a man in his mid to late sixties who appears like a police or government agency official. Philip Graves was a Minuteman until he was elected to the position of Agent in the early Sixties after the death of Agent Neil Walker. His new position was contested by then-Warlord, Mr. Shore, who implicated Graves in the death of Walker and as being in league with other Trust members, but Shore was overruled by Trust leaders Roland Dietrich and Axel Nagel. As Agent, Graves was the head of the Minutemen up until their apparent demise in Atlantic City. Graves himself was believed dead by the Trust until his re- emergence, shortly before the beginning of the series. After his presumed death, Graves retained his access to the attach√© cases containing evidence of a crime, a gun with 100 untraceable bullets, and immunity from law enforcement to give to whomever he pleases. Many of the people he approached were being given an opportunity to deliver justice as they see fit. In some instances, the person was unknowingly used for the Trust's purposes. In other cases, Graves uses the attach√©s to test the person's morality and constitution for varying purposes (sometimes as a precedent to recruitment into the Minutemen). Graves' access to the attach√©s was eventually halted due to the death of his supplier, Abe Rothstein. His true motives were unclear for much of the series, but it became apparent that Graves was looking to avenge his betrayal by taking down the Trust. It eventually revealed that Graves, along with Augustus Medici and Javier Vasco, had masterminded a decades-long grand plan to assume power over the other houses of the Trust. After Vasco's death, Graves and Augustus agreed to sit down with the remaining members of the Trust where, as part of a peace agreement brokered by Augustus, Graves was forced to resign as Agent, only to assume rule over the vacant House of Vasco. Graves was required to select a new Agent from the remaining Minutemen: Cole, Victor, Jack, Dizzy, and Loop. In issue #100, Graves appointed Dizzy as the new Agent and tasked her with punishing those responsible for the death of Benito. He then goes to confront Augustus, blaming him for his son's death. When Graves finds Augustus he chooses to punish him personally, shooting the unarmed Medici in the chest. This accidentally sets off an explosion which kills Megan Dietrich and Cole Burns, and appears to seriously injure Dizzy. The series concludes with Graves cradling Dizzy's body in the middle of the burning household, as she claims that as a Minuteman, she must kill him for killing Augustus and moving against another family of the Trust. Their ultimate fates are not shown, but Graves' mood in the series' closing moments is one of despair, as he declares his life has been ruined, and he does not resist as Dizzy takes aim at his throat in a panel drawn to ape Michaelangelo's Piet√†. It seems extremely unlikely that he will survive. Throughout the series, Graves is always shown to be meticulous and calculating, rarely showing any outbursts of emotions. In some rare instances, he is shown to very much care personally for certain characters (such as in his almost fatherly relationship with Dizzy.) Although he does not appear in every issue or story arc, Graves' presence dominates most of the action and intrigue that occurs in the book. He is possibly an atheist, as when Lono asks him if he believes in God during issue #100, Graves responds, \\"No.\\" He was described by series creator Brian Azzarello as \\"the only character who never lies.\\" The character appeared as an easter egg in the panels of Azzarello's run of Batman \\"Broken City\\". He is based on a composite of actor Lee Marvin and writer Brian Azzarello's grandfather, a Massachusetts police officer. Lono (a.k.a. \\"The Dog\\") First appeared in issue #5. A dangerous, larger-than-life beast of a man born in Hawaii in 1962; Lono is generally presented as the series' most irredeemable character. A Minuteman at the time of the events of Atlantic City, Lono is an ultra-violent, sadistic man prone to enjoying committing such cruelties as torture and rape in the process of pursuing his own ends. He is preternaturally strong and extremely tough, and on multiple occasions is shown to have sustained apparently deadly injuries (such as multiple shootings at close range), only to reappear in a later issue. He is suggested at times to be genuinely psychopathic or even simply insane, but is shown as the series progresses to be somewhat more intelligent and cunning than he is first given credit for. Lono was the only Minuteman not present for the events of Atlantic City, a matter later revealed to have been engineered by Shepherd, who wanted Lono to succeed him as the Trust's Warlord in the event of his own death. Believing his comrades dead, Lono served his own interests until Graves' reappearance and subsequent activation/training of several Minutemen. Eventually, Lono was framed for robbing a bank by Shepherd at Graves' request as punishment for killing Milo Garret (whose true identity was unknown to Lono as he beat him to death - Milo was also the only Minuteman he actually cared about). While in prison, Shepherd told Lono that he was to train the already incarcerated Loop Hughes to become a Minuteman as his personal penance. Before his death, Shepherd told Lono to formally assume his place, revealing that he had never trained Lono to remain as a Minuteman and had always intended him to become Warlord of the Trust. Lono threw himself into his new role with characteristic enthusiasm and somewhat uncharacteristic brains and guile, covertly recruiting several Minutemen as his team and seeking to recruit new ones such as his former prison protege Loop Hughes. Lono even went so far as to attempt to bring Crete, the Medici family's unfailingly loyal bodyguard, into his group of new Minutemen, though ultimately was unsuccessful. Lono anticipated that Graves would attempt to kill Augustus Medici, and worked to position himself as a confidant to the Medicis with considerable influence over Benito. When Lono finally met Dizzy Cordova, he stated that he blamed her for killing Shepherd, which led to a brutal fight between the two. Lono captures Dizzy and offers her (bound and beaten) to Benito, oblivious of Benito and Dizzy's previous relationship and his fondness for her. Benito responds to Lono's act by shooting him in the face. However, the bullet fails to kill Lono, who then fled the Medici property, sustaining multiple severe injuries in the process. Lono contacted Loop while Loop was in the midst of a standoff with remaining Minutemen Victor, Cole and Jack, and in a rage encouraged them to kill each other if they were so inclined, since that's what Graves and the Trust had wanted them to do. In issue #100, Lono breaks back into the Medici grounds and confronts Graves before being shot several times by Dizzy and falling out of a window. The next time the window is shown, his body is absent and there is a trail of blood, leading away. Lono's fate was revealed in the miniseries Brother Lono. Milo Garret (a.k.a. \\"The Bastard\\") First appeared in issue #27 (and previously, in a flashback sequence in issue #10). After Atlantic City he was deactivated, and assumed the life of a hard-boiled and heavy drinking private detective in Los Angeles, reminiscent of the antihero character types popular in \\"pulp\\" stories and the classic Film Noir genre. His face appears fully wrapped in bandages for much of his part in the series, the result of a supposed recent car accident that left him badly disfigured. Milo was hired on a case involving a painting owned by Megan Dietrich that was targeted by Lono and Echo Memoria for purposes unknown. Neither Lono nor Megan recognized Milo, due some combination of the bandages that obscured his face, the long time since seeing one another and/or his frequent usage of assumed names and casual misdirection (a habit he presumably acquired in his new profession as an investigator). In the process of pursuing the case, Milo uncovers several clues associated with the series' greater conspiracy before eventually being awakened to his true nature as Minuteman and regaining his memories. However, having previously been quite open in his personal dislike and distrust of Graves, Milo was unwilling to return to the world of the Minutemen, preferring his new life and all that it involved to the prospect of returning to the group. To that end, Milo engineered his own demise being beaten by Lono's hand and ultimately shot in the mouth by the same Lono, the full story of Graves' intended role for him only becoming clear to Milo in his dying seconds. Milo was reputed to be perhaps the most ruthlessly \\"wicked\\" of the Minutemen, earning him the code name \\"The Bastard\\". Because of his personality he got on well with Lono; when Shepherd reveals to Lono that the man he killed was Milo (whom he didn't recognize due to the bandages on his face), Lono shows sincere regret. Milo was reactivated in issue #34 after seeing the painting \\"La Morte dil Cesare\\" (and its depiction of the word \\"Croatoa\\" above a doorway) in Megan Dietrich's house. Cole Burns (a.k.a. \\"The Wolf\\") First appeared in issue #9. Cole was the first Minuteman shown to be reactivated, shortly after he accepted Graves' offer to avenge his grandmother's untimely death. Prior to his reactivation, he worked as an ice cream salesman, and was running small deals for a local racketeer in New Jersey. He had a girlfriend, Sasha, but the events of his resumed life as a Minuteman apparently left anything between them finished. Cole spends much of the early series as Graves' \\"right hand man\\" and was shown to be fiercely loyal to him even when not fully understanding Graves' plans himself. It was Cole who carried out the murder of Daniel Peres, and assisting Remi Rome in the killing of Mia Simone under Graves' orders. He was also later sent with Mr. Branch to retrieve the La Morte dil Cesar painting from Ronnie Rome, only to find Branch dead once that mission was completed. Following the deaths of Branch (with whom Cole had become friendly) and Wylie Times (with whom Cole was, if not friendly, at least purported to mutually like and/or respect one another) he became disillusioned with Graves' plans. Cole took the painting, then met with Jack Daw and Loop Hughes, seemingly in consideration of changing sides. Lono, who refused to trust Cole after his years of loyalty to Graves, ordered Loop over the phone to terminate Cole on the spot. Loop's attempt to comply with this order is then halted by Jack. Cole and Jack led Loop to a secluded rural area, apparently to execute him. At this point Jack turned on Cole, knocking him out, and allowing Loop to escape. It is later revealed that Cole's intention was supposedly never to kill Loop and the two leave the woods together. A short while later, Cole and Loop run into Jack at a motel, where he is found with Echo Memoria. Cole shoots Echo whilst she and Jack are engaged in sexual intercourse, killing her to avenge Mr. Branch. A standoff ensues, and after assessing their predicament, as well as their roles in the motives of their respective bosses, Cole and the remaining Minutemen (Jack, Loop and Victor) set out to the Medici estate to confront Graves and the Trust. In issue #100, Cole covertly killed Tibo Vermeer and Joan D'Arcy, before confronting Megan Dietrich. Trapping her in a room doused with gasoline, he taunted her with his lighter. The sound of an unexpected gunshot, fired by Agent Graves in another room, caused Cole to accidentally drop the lighter, incinerating both Megan and himself. The lighter is seen to pass through his hand grasp before falling, and given his preternatural reflexes, it is possible that he was able to recover the lighter, but like some of the other Minutemen in the finale, chose his own ending. Cole's codename, \\"The Wolf\\", is reflected in his personal story arc in 100 Bullets. He is at first depicted as unquestioning and loyal to the assumed leader of his \\"pack\\" (Graves), but gradually becomes more independent as another leader (Wylie) dies and Cole finds himself with a greater degree of power. Eventually he seizes a powerful token (the much-sought-after \\"La Morte dil Cesar\\") for his own purposes, and ends the series as a Minuteman gone rogue, killing off Megan Dietrich's would-be alliance with the remaining Trust powers and looking every bit the predator circling his final kill before his death. Cole was reactivated in issue #9 when a junkie, paid by Graves, whispered the word \\"Croatoa\\" to him. He was fully \\"awakened\\" after his ice cream truck exploded and he was caught by the blast. Wylie Times (a.k.a. \\"The Point Man\\") First appeared in issue #28 (and previously, in Cole's flashback sequence in issue #10). A seemingly unimportant gas station attendant and part-time smuggler in El Paso, Texas, Wylie was revealed to have once been thought of as the most intelligent and focused of the Minutemen, as well as by far the best marksman and the deadliest of all the group with a gun. Before his deactivation, he was widely considered the most skilled of the group and served as their field leader. He attracted the attention of Dizzy Cordova after an unsuccessful attempt by Shepherd to reactivate him. Some time after that, Graves offered to Wylie an attach√© whose contents implicated Shepherd in the murder of Rose Madrid, his deceased lover and a member of a family of the Trust. After being reactivated by Graves in New Orleans, Wylie briefly flared with purpose in order to confront his demons, finally making peace with Shepherd (and his own part in Rose Madrid's death) shortly before Shepherd was slain. Soon however, Wylie reverted to his directionless ways, tagging along behind Dizzy through the Mexican desert. Wylie told Graves off when he requested Wylie bring Dizzy into the fold, and was forced to kill his old partner Coochie and his men when they confronted Wylie and Dizzy upon Graves' orders. After encountering Victor Ray, Wylie decided to meet with Graves and exchanged words with Cole and Remi, suggesting he had figured out Graves' plan after mentioning that Graves was possibly attempting an atonement for a dark deed in his past. Tragically, Remi mistook Wylie's reaching for matches in his pocket as him drawing a gun and shot his former leader through the chest (although Victor later suspected other possible motivations for the shooting.) Graves rushed to Wylie in shock and horror, but it was too late to save him. As Wylie died, he had a vision of Rose coming to greet him in the afterlife. Wylie was set apart from the other Minutemen by his skills and leadership. In the course of the series, it is revealed Wylie is the group's commander after Graves. These traits, along with his marksmanship, are likely the reason for his being codenamed \\"The Point Man.\\" Wylie is one of the more redemptive characters in the series, having shown a greater capacity for empathy and caring for other people than several of his fellow Minutemen. He became especially close with Dizzy Cordova, and their relationship carried several parallels to Wylie's with tragically lost love, Rose Madrid. Wylie was reactivated in issue #53 by a musician citing the title of a song he had written, \\"Blue Day for Croatoa.\\" The title was suggested to the musician by Graves. Victor Ray (a.k.a. \\"The Rain\\") First appeared in issue #50 (and previously, obscured in a Cole's flashback sequence in issue #10), where he recounted the story of Roanoke and the origins of the Trust. Graves activated Victor while on his way to meet Dizzy in Chicago for the first time, although this fact is only revealed much later on in the series. For an extended period of time, Victor remained unaffiliated with the rest of the Minutemen as they became reactivated, for reasons known only to him and Graves. Recruited by Lono and Loop shortly after they were released from prison, he carried out the apparent assassination attempt on Megan Dietrich in San Diego and escaped unnoticed. It was later revealed in issue #79 that Lono engineered the purposely botched assassination attempt to solidify power amongst members of the Trust. During this time, Victor also served as a mentoring partner of Loop in the ways of the Minutemen. Eventually, Victor deserted Lono's group in the Mexican desert in favor of Graves, apprehending Branch and Dizzy and leaving an unconscious Benito for his former comrades. Victor (along with Remi) struck again in issue #84, gunning down the wife, children, and associates of the House of Rhone before killing family head Sigmar Rhone himself. He also assassinated Helena Kotias and Constance Von Hagen. Later when Remi was horribly injured, Victor visited him in the hospital, and was the only witness to Remi's suicide. A short while later, Victor was also seen in Omaha, targeting a gun at the household where Tibo Vermeer, Megan Dietrich and Joan D'Arcy were meeting, but the attack was called off by Graves at the last minute due to Vasco's death. He was then made aware of Loop, Cole and Jack's whereabouts and confronted them in an armed standoff at Jack's motel. His loyalty to Graves shaken by Cole's defection, Victor teamed up with the remaining Minutemen to confront Graves. Victor leaves the series with Loop and his own father, Will Slaughter, driving away from the burning house of Medici as the series' climactic events unfold. Victor consistently shows complete control over his emotions and utter dedication to his work. He is notable among the Minutemen for his apparently high intelligence and tremendous precision in executing his missions. Victor is also a highly accurate shot, able to shoot Megan Dietrich just above the heart, as ordered. While Victor appeared the most unquestioningly loyal to Graves of anyone through most of the series, he ultimately chose to side with his intuition rather than follow Graves to his possible/probable death issue #100. Victor was reactivated immediately prior to the events depicted in issue #1. Agent Graves whispered the word into Victor's ear moments before he first approached Dizzy. Jack Daw (a.k.a. \\"The Monster\\") First appeared in issue #21 (and previously, obscured in a Cole's flashback sequence in issue #10). Jack's life was ruled by a heroin addiction while he worked occasional odd jobs as a bouncer in Boston. He was given an attach√© by Graves that was (apparently) the only one containing a picture of its recipient, essentially prompting him to commit suicide. After receiving the attach√©, Jack instead carried on with his life of addiction and crime. Jack and his friend Mikey later made their way toward Atlantic City, where they ran across a business run by Mikey's cousin: a zoo full of wild animals that, for a fee, could be \\"hunted\\" by mafiosi for thrills. When a caged tiger brought back vague memories of his previous life, it is revealed that Jack was a Minuteman at the time of the events of Atlantic City, and that after being deactivated, he had merely descended into a pattern of substance abuse fueled by depressive self- loathing that had been established much earlier in his life. After the personal revelation, Jack parted ways with Mikey, kicked his heroin habit once and for all, and took up bareknuckle street boxing in Atlantic City. Graves, openly scornful of the waste that Jack has made of his life, seemed reluctant to reactivate him before he could fully overcome his erratic and dangerous tendencies. Lono then fully reactivated Jack, though whether this was under direct instruction from Shepherd, Graves, or by his own inclination is unknown. After working for Lono for a while and traveling with Loop and Victor Ray, Jack bolted on his own after receiving the La Morte dil Cesar painting from Cole. He was later found with Echo Memoria by Loop and Cole. Jack then joined the surviving Minutemen as they went to confront Graves in the series' finale. In issue #100, Jack was confronted by Crete, who attempted to stop him from entering the Medici household. The two fought and ultimately tumbled into the alligator pit during their struggle, where it is strongly suggested that both were eaten. However, given the nature of the story and Jack's massive strength, his survival is not out of the question, leaving his future unknown. Jack is physically the largest of all the Minutemen which makes him able to inflict and sustain large amounts of pain. Lono himself stated that Jack was the one most capable of taking out any of the other Minutemen due to his massive size and skills as a fighter. This, paired with the ongoing struggle with his crippling heroin addiction, is the most likely inspiration for his nickname: \\"The Monster\\". Before the series' final issue, Jack reveals that he's developed a distaste for killing after having lived the life of a Minuteman. He nevertheless seemingly dies in the finale while engaged in hand- to-hand combat with the equally imposing Crete. This lends credence to Graves' suggestion that he is his own worst enemy, as Jack remains married to his self-destructive tendencies to the end. Jack was reactivated in issue #68/69, whilst facing Lono is an underground boxing match. Lono arrived for the fight with the word Croatoa freshly tattooed across his stomach, revealing it to Jack when he removed his shirt for the fight. Remi Rome (a.k.a. \\"The Saint\\") First appeared in issue #70 (and previously in Cole's flashback sequence in issue #10.) The seventh Minuteman was concealed by Graves himself, following the Atlantic City incident. Remi's life after being deactivated consisted of working as a meat packer and living at home with his mother and brother in Cleveland. Following his reawakening and an assault on some meat thieves, Remi rejoined Graves' fold. In his capacities as a Minuteman, Remi is shown to be remarkably sadistic, displaying cruel tendencies at times on the level of Lono, as when he volunteered to kill Mia Simone, and when executed the family (including young children) of Sigmar Rhone with Victor Ray. There seemed to be some bitterness between Remi and Cole as they both went out of their way at times to insult one another. In Mexico, Remi was responsible for murdering Wylie Times when he ostensibly mistook Wylie's reaching for matches to be the drawing of a gun. The subsequent elimination of the Rhone faction culminated in the murder of Rhone's family and mistress (both of which Sigmar Rhone was forced to watch, helplessly, until his own elimination occurred.) Remi lost both of his hands in an explosion during his second botched attempt to terminate Joan D'Arcy. Because of this career-ending injury and possibly due to some lingering guilt over Wylie's death, he jumped from the roof of the hospital he was admitted to, an act of suicide. Meanwhile, his brother Ronnie was being carted into the same hospital from an ambulance after an automobile accident. Prior to his suicide, Remi told Victor the incoming (and unknown to him as his brother) victim of the accident would be helpless for the rest of his life, but the hospital would still save him. Betting he'd never miss a target and assuming his mother (who had suffered a false heart attack days before his hospitalization) is dead, he says he'll see her soon and jumps as Ronnie opened his eyes just in time to see Remi descend. Although his impact not actually shown, Victor looks with surprise and utters a one syllable laugh. Remi's personality seemed to annoy lots of people with his couldn't-care-less attitude. His own brother, Ronnie, claimed to have hated him (even as he loved him), and Graves confronted Remi violently about his behaviors on at least one occasion. His immature behavior might be attributed to the fact that Remi was relatively young as a member of the Minutemen - likely the youngest member at the time of the group's dissolution in Atlantic City. His tendency not to over-think orders and ruthlessness in executing missions made him Graves' workhorse, and a natural partner for the disciplined and experienced Victor Ray. Remi was reactivated in issue #73 after Agent Graves paid a homeless person to write \\"Croatoa\\" in the snow on Remi's car. =New Minutemen= Isabelle \\"Dizzy\\" Cordova (a.k.a. \\"The Girl\\")  First appeared in issue #1. The first person to be visibly approached by Graves, Dizzy was an ex-gangbanger who accepted his offer to avenge the deaths of her husband and child at the hands of crooked cops after her release from prison. She was subsequently recruited by Shepherd on behalf of Graves and sent to Paris, ostensibly to be briefed by a reticent Mr. Branch on the nature of her employers. Dizzy was undergoing training by Shepherd to replace Milo as a Minuteman (perhaps the first female one), and was contested for control between Shepherd and Graves. When she refused to go with Graves, her apparently accidental activation by Wylie led to Shepherd's death at her hands. Grief-stricken, she sought solace in the desert surrounding Ju√°rez with thoughts of revenge against Graves until she was soon confronted by the attentions of three men: Wylie, Branch and Benito Medici. Graves later explains that if it was he who activated Dizzy - Shepherd would still be alive. Following Wylie's death, Dizzy was taken to Graves by Victor Ray, and agreed to become a Minuteman. From that time forward, she accompanied Graves until finally running into Lono at the meeting of Graves, Augustus Medici and Javier Vasco. Lono (who blamed her for Shepherd's death) attacked Dizzy, and after a fight subdued and delivered her personally to Benito. When Benito saw Dizzy beaten and bound, he shot Lono, and took Dizzy inside to tend to her injuries. In issue #100, Dizzy was named the new Agent of the Trust by Graves, and was tasked with punishing whoever killed Benito. She confronted Megan, but was interrupted by Cole, who had prepared to deal with Megan himself. After Dizzy left Megan to Cole, the pools of gasoline in the room were accidentally ignited by Cole's dropped lighter, and the resulting explosion seriously injured Dizzy. She was thrown from the balcony and fell onto a vase which shattered, possibly injuring her spine. Graves found her laying on the ground in the burning house, and told her that he had killed Augustus Medici. In the final scene of the series, Graves cradles Dizzy's body in the burning house, and she pressed a gun to his head. As an Agent, she says that she must punish him for taking action against another house. Their ultimate fates are not shown, but since Dizzy is unable to walk out of the burning, isolated house, her survival appears unlikely.  Louis \\"Loop\\" Hughes (a.k.a. \\"The Boy\\")  First appeared in issue #15. Loop was a relatively well adjusted teenager living in Philadelphia, foregoing the gangster life-style of his peers. Despite his being the target in Graves' attache, Loop decided instead to reconcile his differences with his estranged father. After their reunion, Loop was tutored by Curtis for a short while before Curtis' death. Soon after, he was implicated in a murder and sent to prison, an outcome intended by Graves, after Loop declined an offer to work for him. While imprisoned, he was trained to become a Minuteman under Lono, at Mr. Shepherd's request. The two were released following Shepherd's death, and Loop followed Lono in pursuing Sheperd's unfinished agenda. Loop's first assignment as a Minuteman was to act as spotter for Victor Ray in the failed assassination attempt on Megan Dietrich. With Lono promoted to Warlord of the Trust, Loop found a new mentor in Victor. He was ordered to kill Cole by Lono but was stopped by Jack. After several more attempts by Lono to break the remaining Minutemen apart, Loop eventually joined Victor, Cole and Jack to confront Graves and the Trust. In issue #100, Loop kills several body guards in the climactic events at the Medici residence before finally deciding that he did not want to be a Minuteman and, just as he intended to do after his father's death, Loop walks away. During the series' climactic events, he was shown driving away from the burning house of Medici with Victor Ray and Will Slaughter, having decided not to go down the violent path of a Minuteman. =Former Minutemen=Mr. Shepherd First appeared in issue #2. An equally mysterious associate of Graves, Joseph Shepherd was a former Minuteman who became their trainer and liaison with the Trust when he was appointed as its Warlord. He was ordered by the Trust to eliminate the Minutemen, but instead worked with Graves to conceal six of the seven that were present at Atlantic City. His true loyalties remained unknown as he maintained his own agenda somewhere between that of Graves' and the Trust's. Vying with Graves for control of Dizzy Cordova, Shepherd was mortally wounded when Wylie activated her, but he managed to appoint Lono as his successor and entrust him with Loop's training before succumbing to death in the desert somewhere near Juarez. He also cited Dizzy specifically as the replacement for Milo Garret, which suggests that Milo's death may have been manipulated more intentionally than previously thought. In the Tarantula story arc, Mr. Shepherd's origin story revealed him to be a New York park basketball player who had served in Vietnam before being dishonorably discharged (it is implied for reasons related to his homosexuality). Agent Graves recruited Shepherd for the Minutemen after he was unable to prove Shepherd murdered a young man whom the story intimates had beaten another man into a coma. Graves was impressed by Shepherd after his own inability to prove the young man's guilt, as Shepherd seemed totally unrattled by any intimidation. Graves' decision to recruit Shepherd despite his homosexuality proved to be the last straw for Loop's father Curtis Hughes, who was excluded from the Minutemen because of his race, but had remained in service to Graves in the apparent hope that an exception would eventually be made if he proved himself capable and loyal. Will Slaughter First appeared in issue #87. A retired Minuteman, Slaughter has been working as a contract killer in order to support his young wife and three girls. According to himself, his replacement as a Minuteman was someone he raised himself (a son or otherwise). He has recently been brought back into the activities of the Trust by Joan D'Arcy, following the elimination of three Trust heads within one week. He killed Mr. Rothstein on D'Arcy's orders, and later assassinated Vasco. He was next seen sneaking into Lono's room, and appeared ready to kill him, but Slaughter quietly walked away when he overheard Lono's phone conversation with the remaining Minutemen. Slaughter was revealed to be the father of Victor Ray in issue #100, and is seen leaving the Medici estate with Victor and Loop Hughes during the climactic melee. Mr. Shore Shore was the Trust's Warlord during the Fifties and Sixties, when the late Neil Walker was the Minutemen's Agent. Shore was described by Graves as a \\"Company Man\\", disliked by Graves and the likes of Vasco and Medici for his apparent loyalty to the traditional powers who led the Trust. Shore opposed Graves' elevation to the position of Agent in 1962, believing that Graves had allegiances with the young family heads, and a separate agenda of his own which would taint the Minutemen. Shore is no longer active, and probably dead, but this is not confirmed. Supporting charactersMr. Branch= First appeared in issue #12. Branch was a journalist who was offered the attach√© by Graves. He chose to investigate the origins of Graves' power and uncovered the existence of the Trust along the way. This earned him a traumatic visit from Lono, as well as an encounter with Shepherd, who revealed to him the deeper history of the Trust and the Minutemen. Branch fled to Paris, and continued to research his obsession at great personal risk. He was briefly scared off the case by Cole Burns during Dizzy Cordova's visit to Paris, but developed an infatuation for her, which led him to accept a dangerous request by Megan Dietrich to return to the States. Diverted from meeting with Megan, he was compelled by Cole to track down Echo Memoria in Europe, but reneged on the deal in order to chase after Dizzy. He found Dizzy in Mexico along with Wylie Times and Benito Medici. The quartet lived together until Victor captured Dizzy and Branch and brought them back to the States (with Branch losing a finger in the process). Cole then met Branch once more, and tasked him with the recovery the stolen La Morte dil Cesar painting from Ronnie Rome. Branch met his end in Atlantic City in issue #88, at the hands of Echo Memoria. Cole would later kill Echo to avenge Branch, with whom he had established an unlikely friendship. =Curtis Hughes= First appeared in issue #15. Curtis was the father of Loop Hughes. He left his family when Loop was very young, and eventually took up working as a collections man for small-time mobster Rego in Philadelphia. Curtis was a past acquaintance and operative of Graves, and he enjoyed at least token respect from most of the Minutemen. It is revealed that Curtis was once selected by Graves to become a Minuteman himself, but the Trust blocked his appointment because of his race, and as a consequence his role was restricted to assisting Graves in the recruitment and training of other Minutemen (including Mr. Shepherd). His disillusionment with the Trust based on their racism led to him eventually leaving Graves' service. After Graves' gave Loop an attach√© containing his father's picture, Curtis became reacquainted with his son, whom he mentored for a brief period of time. Curtis then refused Graves' offer of an attach√© of his own, and as well as another chance to become a Minuteman in his advanced age. Covering for his son Loop over some stolen money owed to Rego, Curtis was finally killed by Rego's henchmen in an arson attack. =Echo Memoria= First appeared in issue #26. An art thief of Italian origin, Echo was first seen in Paris, touting herself as a prostitute to Branch in order to extract information about the Trust from him. She was next seen with Milo Garret as part of a scheme to steal the La Morte dil Cesar painting. She disappeared with Lono and the painting after Garret's death, but soon left him as well. She was immediately arrested at the airport as she attempted to flee the country by purchasing a plane ticket with some of the stolen money used by Shepherd to set Lono up. Some time later, Echo was apparently released from custody and, according to Cole Burns, returned to Europe. Later, Graves sent Ronnie Rome to Europe to retrieve the La Morte dil Cesar painting from her. Echo was next seen in Atlantic City in issue 88 talking to Mr. Branch, and he is later found dead at the same spot where they met. Eventually, Echo then met up with Jack, who was in possession of the La Morte dil Cesar painting, before she was killed by Cole Burns in retaliation for the murder of his friend Branch. In the end, her body was wrapped in the painting she had so long sought, and both were dumped into a swamp. The entire significance of the painting to Echo is never fully made clear. =Ronnie Rome= First appearance in issue #70. The brother of Remi Rome, Ronnie was an enforcer for small-time mobster Mimo Pallidino in Cleveland. Ronnie was given an attach√© from Agent Graves, with Remi as his target. Remi found the attach√© before it could be used, and confronted Ronnie about it, but the gun was not actually fired until the pair find themselves in a shootout with meat thieves (a battle that left Ronnie crippled). Following the assault, Remi disappeared (to resume his life as an activated Minuteman) and Ronnie was eventually visited by Agent Graves. Graves made use of Ronnie, sending him to Italy to recover the La Morte dil Cesar painting from Echo Memoria. Ronnie delivered the painting to Cole Burns, who came close to shooting Ronnie in revenge for Remi killing Wylie. After finding out about Remi's accident, Ronnie was on his way to visit his brother in the hospital when his taxi was overturned in a road rage-related accident. Ronnie was last seen on a stretcher outside of the hospital where Remi committed suicide by jumping off the roof of the hospital. It is unclear if Remi fell on his brother or not, but it is made clear that Ronnie did witness his brother's fall. =Crete= First appeared in issue #23. Crete is the massive, quiet bodyguard of Augustus Medici. Crete is shown to possess great skills at his job, has tremendous physical strength, is an excellent fighter and tracker, and despite his size is preternaturally quick. He declined Lono's attempt to recruit him as a soldier when he was made Warlord of the Trust, preferring instead to continue to provide his services to the House of Medici. Crete seems to be incredibly loyal to the Medici family and will stop at nothing to protect them. He openly detests Lono and repeatedly states that he will kill him if he does anything to harm the Medicis. It is revealed that Crete was once recruited to join the Minutemen (presumably by Graves), but he chose to become the Medici's bodyguard instead. In issue #100, Crete stands in the way of Jack Daw from entering the Medici household, fighting him until they fall into the alligator pit, where they are both apparently eaten. = Abe Rothstein = A very well-connected arms dealer with substantial ties to local organized law enforcement, FBI, CIA and \\"higher\\". He was an ally of Graves, and is the apparent source of all of Graves' attaches, guns, untraceable bullets and legal immunity. He was tortured and killed by Will Slaughter in issue #91 at Joan D'Arcy's request, thus ending Graves' \\"game.\\"  References  External links  * 100Bullets.co.uk fan site, on material from which parts of this article were based 100 Bullets Category:100 Bullets ","title":"List of 100 Bullets characters"},{"id":"2487803","text":"Eastern Park on opening day 1894 Eastern Park was a baseball park in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York in the 1890s. It was bounded by Eastern Parkway‚Äîlater renamed Pitkin Avenue when Eastern Parkway was diverted‚Äîto the north (home plate); the Long Island Rail Road and Vesta Avenue (later renamed Van Sinderen Avenue) to the east (left field); Sutter Avenue to the south (center field); and Powell Street to the west (right field). The ballpark held 12,000 people. It was originally the home of the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders of the Players' League in 1890.Project Ballpark After the one-year Players' League experiment, the park became the part-time home of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1891 and then full-time during 1892‚Äì1897, between their stints at the two versions of Washington Park. Some sources erroneously say that it is here that the nickname \\"Trolley Dodgers\\", later shortened to \\"Dodgers\\", first arose, due to the need for fans to cross various trolley lines to reach the ballpark. Although the Dodgers played at Eastern Park in 1895 when the name \\"Trolley Dodgers\\" was first used, the name was based on the dangers of trolleys in Brooklyn, generally, and not trolley lines that needed to be crossed to get to the game. There were no trolley lines near Eastern Park at the time. Eastern Park was considered difficult to reach, and although the team survived there for seven seasons, the venture there was a failure. When Charlie Ebbets acquired the Dodgers, he moved the team back, to the second version of Washington Park, which was both closer to the city center and offered a lower rent. The park also hosted numerous college and amateur football games during its heyday, notably the Princeton-Yale game of 1890. There was also a track installed, and both bicycling and running races were held from time to time. It was also the home venue of the short-lived Brooklyn Bridegrooms Soccer Team in 1894. This was a spin-off of the Baseball Franchise that took part in an ill-fated attempt by six baseball franchises to fill their stadiums in the off season by running a soccer league. Brooklyn were top of the league when the uncompleted season was cancelled and play never resumed.

Frank Baum and his successors,John Neill's The Runaway in Oz was intended to be the thirty-seventh Oz book, but its publication was delayed until 1995. and the first written by Jack Snow. It was illustrated by Frank G. Kramer. The book entered the Public Domain in the United States, when its copyright was not renewed as required.US Copyright Office. http://www.copyright.gov/ A new \\"Royal Historian\\" Jack Snow was the fourth official chronicler or \\"Royal Historian\\" of Oz, after Baum himself, Ruth Plumly Thompson, and long-time Oz illustrator John R. Neill. Snow made a conscious attempt to return to Baum's inspiration for Oz; in both of the Oz books he wrote, The Magical Mimics and The Shaggy Man of Oz (1949), he deliberately avoided using any characters introduced by Thompson or Neill.David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 79. Snow crammed Magical Mimics with Baum's characters, sometimes presented in long rosters.Jack Snow, The Magical Mimics in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1946; pp. 32, 179-86, 237. Little room was left for original characters; Snow's main creations were his Mimic villains,Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 175, 226. plus the fairy Ozana, her kitten Felina, and her wooden puppet people the Hi-Los.Who's Who in Oz, pp. 67, 94, 150-1. Snow's approach was controversial among fans of Thompson's and Neill's works; yet it had the virtue of workability. Prior to their acceptance of Snow as an Oz author, publisher Reilly & Lee had solicited veteran children's-book writer Mary Dickerson Donahey for the job. Dickerson Donahey turned the publisher down, however, since she judged that \\"it would be too much of a struggle to keep track of all the characters and plots in the series.\\"Jack Snow, The Magical Mimics in Oz, with an Afterword by Michael Gessel, Kinderhook, IL, International Wizard of Oz Club, 1990; Afterword, p. 246. Snow drew upon a range of Baum's books for hints and inspirations. A talking Toto, for example, is important in Snow's narrative; Baum first made Toto speak at the end of Tik-Tok of Oz. Yet the work that Snow relied upon most heavily for Magical Mimics was Baum's sixth Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz. The Emerald City of OzMimics and Phanfasms= Snow based his villainous Magical Mimics on the Phanfasms in Baum's Emerald City. In the eleventh chapter of that book, Baum states that \\"the Erbs are the most powerful and merciless of all evil spirits, and the Phanfasms of Phantastico belong to the race of Erbs.\\" Snow makes his Mimics another type of Erb; they live within the hollows of Mount Illuso, a peak next door to Mount Phantastico. Like the Phanfasms, the Mimics are ugly and malevolent shape-shifters; they have the additional trick of being able to copy the appearance of humans, simply by stepping into their shadows. People duplicated in this way are paralyzed by the magic, but remain conscious. The Mimics' inherent malice orients them against all that is \\"good and happy and just in the world\\" -- which makes them an obvious danger to Oz. The fairy queen Lurline foresaw this: as soon as she had enchanted Oz into a fairyland, Lurline placed one of her followers in watch over the Mimics, to forestall their mischief. =Structure and nuance= Snow also structures his story as Baum did his Emerald City. In that book, Baum expanded upon the simple narrative type he often favors to tell a double story, shifting perspective between views of the good and the evil characters. Snow does the same in Magical Mimics. The two books are also united by subtle commonalities. One example: while General Guph is travelling to the Mountain of Phantastico in Emerald City, Chapter 11, a friendly talking squirrel advises him to \\"Look out!\\" As Dorothy and the Wizard walk to Ozana's cottage in the tenth chapter of Magical Mimics, they also encounter the advice of a friendly talking squirrel.Magical Mimics, pp. 102-4. Synopsis At the start of Snow's story, Princess Ozma and Glinda the Good are planning to leave Oz, to attend the Grand Council of the fairy queen Lurline, held in the Forest of Burzee every 200 years. Dorothy Gale is surprised when Ozma appoints her to rule Oz during their absence; but Ozma reminds Dorothy that she is a princess of Oz. (Ozma's choice is not well-motivated; but it is in keeping with Snow's \\"Baum-centric\\" approach, in that it places Baum's primary heroine Dorothy at the center of the coming action.) Chapter 3 shifts attention to the evil Mimics in their lair in Mount Illuso. The Mimics habitually shift \\"from one loathsome shape to another\\" -- an ape body with a head of an alligator, and a serpent with black butterfly wings, and a toad with a hyena's head are a few of their choices. Their rulers, King Umb and Queen Ra (a play on \\"umbra\\"), reveal their plan to counter Lurline's controlling magic and attack Oz. The shape-shifting royals and their minions fly to Oz as big black birds, and waylay Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz. By stepping into their shadows, Ra and Umb take the shapes of Dorothy and the Wizard; the originals are paralyzed by the magic, and are carried off to Mount Illuso by Mimics. Ra and Umb, in their stolen forms, search Ozma's library for the antidote to Lurline's magic spell. Umb and Ra are not capable of imitating the Wizard and Dorothy convincingly; people become suspicious, and Toto exposes them -- but not before the Mimic royals find what they are looking for. Back in Mount Illuso, they conjure a gigantic red spider that spins a magic web; this negates the influence of Lurline's spell, and allows the Mimics to launch a mass attack against Oz. Dorothy and the Wizard are imprisoned in a cave deep within Mount Illuso. There, however, they see a blaze of brilliant fairy light that restores their power of motion. The light stems from a button on the cave wall. They press the button, and a hidden door opens to expose an elevator and its attendant. Hi-Lo,For the name, compare \\"Earl Highlough\\" in Baum's short story \\"The Runaway Shadows.\\" a living wooden puppet, takes them to the top of the mountain. There, the two Ozites discover Pineville and are led to the fairy Ozana, who had been delegated by Lurline to watch over the malicious Mimics. Ozana has spent her lonely days and years creating her Story Blossom Garden and her wooden puppet people (one of whom has escaped to the outer world, to become Charlie McCarthy).The Magical Mimics in Oz, p. 98. Ozana is shocked to discover that the Mimics have evaded her guardianship; she leads Dorothy and the Wizard back to Oz, flying on giant swans.Glinda sometimes flies in a magic chariot pulled by swans. The attacking Mimics arrive in Oz disguised as beautiful birds, with gorgeous plumage of \\"Red, blue, green and gold....\\" The residents are seduced by their beauty, and the Mimics quickly duplicate and paralyze them. The trick works only on humans; fierce beasts like the Cowardly Lion and Hungry Tiger are magically sedated, while the Scarecrow, the Patchwork Girl and other non-human creatures are simply tied up. The Mimics have largely accomplished their ends when they confront the simultaneous arrivals of Ozma and Glinda, and Ozana, Dorothy, and the Wizard. Ozana's magic is powerful enough to subdue Ra and Umb and reverse their spells. The Mimics, back in their grotesque forms, are herded into the mirrored grand ballroom of Ozma's palace; good magic imprisons them in the ballroom's many mirrors, from where they are sent back to the interior of Mount Illuso. Order is restored to Oz, and celebrated with the usual concluding banquet. Ozana is rewarded with an invitation to live in Oz; her Pineville people and her Story Blossom Garden are magically transported to Oz so that she will not miss them. Story Blossom Garden One notable imaginative feature of Snow's book is Ozana's Story Blossom Garden.Gessel, Afterword, Magical Mimics, 1990, p. 248. Ozana's magically-bred human-faced talking flowers appeal to be picked, so that they can tell their stories into people's ears. Every flower tells its own unique tale, and each type of flower relates one kind of narrative. Roses tell love stories, though rambling roses tell travel stories. Tulips tell Dutch stories. Pansies yield fairy tales, while a tiger lily will recount \\"a thrilling story of splendid silken beasts in their sultry jungle lairs.\\" A \\"spicily-scented\\" pink carnation can provide \\"an exciting story of intrigue and adventure in high places.\\" Water lilies supply sea tales, while lotus blossoms and poppies offer their own seductive choices. Even the occasional weed offers a tale, about \\"Dick Superguy -- greatest detective in the world!\\"Magical Mimics, pp. 127-38. Reception; later editions The first edition of Magical Mimics was not a commercial success; a backlog of unsold copies delayed the next Oz book, originally projected for 1947, until 1949.Gessel, Afterword, Magical Mimics, 1990, pp. 250-1. Kramer's illustrations for Magical Mimics have been criticized as deficient.Gessel, Afterword, Magical Mimics, 1990, p. 249. Magical Mimics had been out of print for decades when the International Wizard of Oz Club issued a reprint in 1990, with a useful Afterword by Michael Gessel. Other editions followed, from Books of Wonder (1991) and Kessinger (2007).

These are usually racing competitions, but there are also aerobatic contests and on-line league tables. History of competitions A typical GPS logger used to record flights of sailplanes for competitions and badge claims. It also provides navigational information about the next turn-points and areas of controlled airspace. In the early days, the main goal was to stay airborne for as long as possible. However, flights could last for days and some pilots killed themselves by falling asleep. This type of duration contest was abandoned by 1939. From the earliest days of gliding there was also 'free distance' flying. Pilots launched themselves from a hill top, attempting to glide as far as possible. Once pilots learned to exploit ridge lift and thermals, flights could be extended further. Eventually they mastered flying from thermal to thermal, resulting in ever longer retrieves. As the pilots and gliders became better, the winner of a competition day might fly so far that they could not get back to the competition site for the next day. Turn-points were therefore used. Those pilots who managed to fly all the way to the turn-point and back would score the same distance as for free distance flights. When pilots and gliders became even better, most of the pilots would complete the task. Points were then awarded for speed. Initially, observers would be stationed at the turn-points to verify that the pilots rounded them. Large easily seen contest numbers (sometimes in addition to the glider's registration) were, and still are, located on the bottom of one wing, and each side of the fin, to ease identification. As the years progressed, pilots used (film) cameras to photograph each turnpoint from the air to prove that they had rounded each one and a barograph to prove that they had not landed en route. Today, all tracking methods have been totally replaced with GPS-based FAI approved flight recorders to (securely) log their positions and flight so that they can prove that the task was correctly completed. Present day Modern gliding competitions now comprise closed tasks where everyone races on an aerial route around specified turn-points, plus start and finish points, that brings everybody back to base. The weather forecast and the performance of the gliders, as well as the experience level of the pilots, dictate the length of the task. Today, most of the points are speed points. The general rule is to set the task so that all pilots have a fair chance of completing it, with the fastest pilot gaining the most points for that day. With the advent of GPS, new types of tasks were introduced such as speed or distance tasks within assigned areas, and speed or distance tasks with pilot-selected turn-points (during flight based on perceived advantages). Despite the use of pilot- selected turn-points made possible by GPS, tasks over a fixed course are still used frequently. In the European Gliding Championships in 2005, a task of 1,011 km was set in the open class; the longest task in an international competition. The FAI Sporting Code for gliders sets out the rules and procedures to be used to verify soaring performances in competitions and badge flights. The main objective of these rules is to ensure that a consistent level of proof is achieved for all flights.FAI Sporting Code: Section 3 - Gliders Levels of competition Competitions are held at the local, regional, national and international level. Strong performance at the regional level allows pilots to gain a high enough ranking to enter national championships. Thereafter international competitions are available for the most ambitious pilots: the European Gliding Championships, and the World Gliding Championships. There is also the prestigious Barron Hilton Cup, which is an invitation event for the top pilots. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes just for women, and two junior classes (See Glider Competition Classes). Some competitive classes (Sports Class in the US, Club Class elsewhere) have scoring systems that are handicapped based on the type of glider each pilot is flying. This allows pilots to compete on a relatively equal basis even if their gliders have widely varying performance. A typical competition day grid at Lasham Airfield in 2009 Gliding contests generally last one week, but international contests last two weeks. Sometimes days are allocated for practice before the contest to allow non- local pilots to familiarize themselves with the contest area. Each day an initial decision is made as to the likelihood that the conditions for the day are adequate to remain aloft. If so, the pilots are told to prepare (assemble) their gliders and move them onto the runway launch grid and prepare to launch. The order of the gliders on the grid is predetermined for each day and rotates amongst the pilots. The contest pilots gather at the start of each contest day to learn about the day's forecast weather conditions, to obtain briefings on operational and safety related issues, to hear about the previous day's results (if any) and possibly to hear from the previous day's winning pilot(s). Behind the scenes, the weather forecaster will discuss the local predicted conditions for the day with the task-setter (which is sometimes a committee). Once the task for the day has been decided, a pilot's briefing is held to describe the task and provide an update on forecast weather and any airspace restrictions. Often a non-competing pilot will make a preliminary flight to verify conditions aloft (known as a \\"sniffer\\"). Launching takes place when the director believes that the gliders can stay airborne. The task for the day is based on the predicted soaring and weather conditions of the day and is made up of a combination of a minimum time in the air (between 2 and 5 hours) coupled with a collection of locations (turnpoints) which must be overflown (within a specified radius). Some turnpoints may be mandatory, others may be optional, or a combination of both. Some days can simply not be flown and are referred to as \\"non-contest\\" days. In a typical 7 day regional contest, at least 3 days must be \\"contest days\\" to constitute a valid contest. If every day of the contest can be flown, then at least one day will not be flown (known as a \\"rest day\\"), in an effort to increase safety by preventing excessive fatigue. Launching all the gliders usually takes less than an hour. While gliders are being launched, the other gliders which are already airborne will attempt to remain aloft and stay in the vicinity. Gliders that land due to loss of lift are allowed to relaunch (\\"re-light\\") but must wait until all other gliders have been launched at least once. Once all gliders in a class are launched and have had time to get into a position to start, the launch director will announce that the \\"start gate is open\\" via radio. This means that pilots can begin flying their assigned task and can start immediately, or might delay their start for tactical or weather-related reasons. The pilot must announce his start time via radio. Each pilot will then attempt to fly the task as quickly as possible. Some pilots will be unable to find lift at the beginning of the flight and return to the airport for an additional tow (known as a \\"re-light\\") and start his attempted flight again - this is allowed any number of times. If the pilot is unable to find lift during some part of the task he may be forced to 'land out' in a farmer's field or at a distant airfield. Sometimes this is caused by deteriorating weather, sometimes because of rejecting an area of lift and flying on in the hope of finding even better lift (since the object is not to use every encountered lift source as this takes time without any gain in distance). The pilot will garner some contest points even if he does not completed the task for the day. For those that land out, the glider is either de-rigged and towed back in a trailer (always if landing at a non-airport), or (if at an airport) a tow-plane can be sent to re-launch the glider and so return it to base (both cases are known as a \\"retrieve\\"). Generally the start and finish locations are at, or quite near to, the home airfield for the contest. If there are severe weather conditions, an alternate \\"safety finish\\" location may have to be announced to the competitors. Scoring Part of one day's results from 2009 European Championships - Open Class Each glider carries a device for recording its GPS position every few seconds in a secure format. Following landing, the pilots hand in their loggers to the scorer for downloading. The scorer uses computer software to analyze the resulting GPS data. This provides evidence that the start, turn-points and finish have been legitimately reached. The winner on each competition day is the fastest around the task and is given the maximum score of 1000 points. This score can be devalued if very few gliders get around the task. This is because that luck was probably a key factor if only a few gliders get round the task. The scores for other pilots are then assigned according to their speed relative around the task of the winner. A small proportion of the maximum score is given for the distance covered so that competitors who do not complete the task, will still get a score. In some competitions handicapping that is based on the performance of the glider is used and so further factors are applied before determining each pilot's score for the day. Preliminary scores are usually available within a short time after the last landing, but there may be protests and penalties. The final scores are usually formally announced at the beginning of the next contest day during the pilot's briefing for the next day's task. Often the winning pilot in the each class is asked to speak about how they won. Water ballast It may seem counter-intuitive, but pilots put water ballast into compartments in the wings to make their planes heavier. Modern gliders can take large quantities of water (a Nimbus-3 can hold 272 kg). The objective is to increase the gliding speed, while maintaining the same gliding angle. The downside is that the glider will climb more slowly in thermals. However in the right conditions, the time lost in climbing more slowly is more than recouped by the increased speed to the next thermal. The benefits depend on three factors: the aerodynamic performance of the type of glider at various speeds and weights, the strength of the thermals on the day and the width of the thermals on the day. The increased sink rate will have a small percentage effect on the climb rate in strong thermals. The extra weight of ballast requires the pilot to bank more to stay in narrow thermals and this also increases the sink rate. Competition pilots usually launch with ballast. If the thermals are weaker and/or smaller, it may be better to continue the flight without ballast and so they may dump it soon after the start or part way round the course. However it is possible that conditions may strengthen and so sometimes keeping the ballast throughout the task may be advantageous. The airframe of a glider is not designed to withstand the stresses of a hard landing while the glider is loaded with water. Consequently, pilots start emptying the ballast tanks shortly before the gliders cross the finish line so they are empty when they land. This results in spectacular images when competition pilots cross the finish line at low altitude. Recent rules changes are making this practice less desirable for safety reasons. Racing strategy and tactics Races are won on the basis of speed over the day's course. Time on course is measured from when each pilot leaves the start zone until they finish. Each competitor may elect to start any time after the start opens. To allow all competitors sufficient time to get into a good position to start, competition rules specify that no competitor may start until twenty minutes after the last competitor has launched. The start can be a line, or it can be a cylinder several miles in radius. In both cases there is a specified maximum altitude for the start and competitors typically will attempt to start as close to the maximum start height as possible. One of the more important decisions of a flight is when to start. This decision is based mostly on each pilot's desire to be on course during the strongest weather conditions of the day. There are also competitive considerations. Often competitors will try to start just after other pilots, using them as \\"markers\\" for favorable lift conditions ahead on course. Using this technique, a skilled pilot can make up several minutes on the earlier starters during the early portion of the flight. Pilots who are being followed in this way may use a variety of tactics to shake off pursuers, such as doubling back after a start and starting again. Each pilot may start as many times as he or she chooses - only the last start counts. However, playing an endless game of \\"start gate roulette\\" can have disadvantages. Late starters can find themselves still out on course when the soaring weather becomes weak or wholly unsuitable. The best pilots are therefore also good weather forecasters. Landing out loses most of the points available on the day The most important factors influencing the overall speed at which glider can fly around a given course is the average strength of the rising air the pilot chooses for climbing and the directness of the route chosen around the course (no credit is given for deviations, but a detour to reach stronger lift can often more than make up in speed for the extra distance travelled). Experienced pilots typically pass by relatively weak lift, selecting only the strongest lift for climbing. However, being too selective runs the risk of getting too low to the ground and being forced to accept any available sources of rising air (no matter how weak) in order to avoid \\"landing out\\". This can cost the competitor valuable time. The best pilots also are expert at getting the most out of each source of lift by maneuvering their glider quickly to the center of the lift where the rate of climb is greatest. They also are highly skilled as using a wide variety of information (weather forecasts, terrain features, clouds, other gliders on course) to estimate what conditions are likely to be like ahead on course and adapt their flying tactics to maximize their overall speed. It is often possible to fly efficiently by merely slowing down in the rising air while flying straight ahead on course, instead of circling, then speeding up again when the air is no longer rising. This technique is known as 'dolphining'. If the conditions are favorable, the glider can gain enough energy from each source of lift and maintain its overall height for long distances without circling. Days with steady, moderate winds can be good for this, as the thermals often will line up into cloud streets, enabling the pilot to race without having to turn. Choosing a flight path directly on course line may not be the best tactic if a slight diversion can keep the glider in rising air for longer, or at worst keep out of the strongly sinking air. Throughout the task gliders will often fly together in 'gaggles', because a group of gliders is more likely to find better lift than one glider on its own. Pilots sometimes have to decide whether to stay with a gaggle or go on their own in another direction where they believe there will be better lift. On days when there are no cumulus clouds to indicate where there is lift, gaggle flying is the norm. However gaggle flying makes it more difficult for a pilot to gain significantly more points than the other competitors. One of the last key decisions that each competitor makes is determining when the glider is high enough to reach the finish line. This is a critical decision because, on the one hand, taking on unnecessary altitude wastes time because there are no points gained for arriving high at the finish. On the other hand, running out of altitude before the finish can result in a costly (and embarrassing) \\"land- out\\". For any given lift conditions, there is an optimal final glide speed to minimize the overall time required - the stronger the lift, the faster (and steeper) the final glide should be. Pilots use sophisticated glide computers to calculate the altitude required and to track progress along the way. Most pilots plan their final glide with extra altitude ranging from several hundred to more than a thousand feet as insurance in case unanticipated sinking air is encountered on the final part of the flight. Grand Prix In an attempt to widen the appeal of gliding contests, a new format contest, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring. Online contests Informal internet competitions are also popular where pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on factors such as distance, achieved speed and whether the task flown was declared in advance. In 2009, 13.424 pilots worldwide participated in a contest sponsored by a German aviation magazine, 'Aerokurier', though other countries also operate their own national 'ladders'. Aerobatics Aerobatic competitions are held regularly. In this type of competition, the pilots fly a program of maneuvers (such as inverted flight, loop, roll, and various combinations). Each maneuver has a rating called the \\"K-Factor\\". Maximum points are given for the manoeuvre if it is flown perfectly, otherwise points are deducted. Efficient maneuvers also enable the whole program to be completed with the height available. The winner is the pilot with the most points.

During the An Shi Rebellion, he surrendered to An Lushan and served as chancellor of An's state of Yan at Luoyang. After Tang forces recaptured Luoyang, he was forced to commit suicide.  Background  It is not known when Chen Xilie was born, but it is known that he was from S√≤ng Prefecture (ÂÆãÂ∑û, roughly modern Shangqiu, Henan). However, nothing else is known about his family, as no family tree was given for him in the table of the chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang.See New Book of Tang, vol. 71 Chen was known to be well-studied, particularly in Taoism-related mysticism, and was also a capable writer.  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  During the middle of Emperor Xuanzong's KƒÅiyu√°n era (713-741), Emperor Xuanzong was interested in the classic texts, and often had scholars explain the texts to him. Originally, this was done by the officials Ch«î W√∫li√†ng () and Yu√°n X√≠ngch≈çng (). After Chu died in 719 and Yuan died in 729,New Book of Tang, vol. 200 . Emperor Xuanzong engaged Chen Xilie and F√©ng Ch√°oy«ên () to frequently explain the Tao Te Ching and the I Ching to him.Old Book of Tang, vol. 97 . Chen was initially promoted to be M√¨sh≈´ Sh√†ojiƒÅn (), the deputy head of the Palace Library, and also succeeded Zhang Jiuling in heading the imperial institute J√≠xi√°n Institute ().This progression of offices is per Chen's biography in the Old Book of Tang. His biography in the New Book of Tang gave a different progression -- that he served as Zh≈çngsh≈´ Sh√®r√©n (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zh≈çngsh≈´ Shƒõng); that while he headed Jixian Institute he was also the deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, G≈çngb√π Sh√¨l√°ng); and that he then served as M√©nxi√† Sh√¨l√°ng (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, M√©nxi√† Shƒõng). Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 97 with New Book of Tang, vol. 223, part 1 . Whenever Emperor Xuanzong was writing something of importance, Chen would assist him in drafting the language. In 742, when the official Ti√°n T√≥ngxi√π () reported seeing an appearance of Laozi above DƒÅnf√®ng Gate (), Chen was one of the officials who submitted a statement flattering Emperor Xuanzong for the holiness of his reign. In 746, after the chancellor Li Shizhi was removed from office due to machinations by his colleague Li Linfu, Li Linfu believed that Chen had a subservient personality and would be easy to control, and therefore recommended Chen to succeed Li Shizhi. Emperor Xuanzong gave Chen the designation T√≥ng Zh≈çngsh≈´ M√©nxi√† P√≠ngzhƒÅngsh√¨ (), making Chen a chancellor de facto. It was said that Chen followed Li Linfu's directions in all matters and that Chen merely signed all documents that Li Linfu wanted him to sign. Later, he was made Zu«í Xi√†ng (), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor, as well as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bƒ´ngb√π Sh√†ngsh≈´). He was created the Duke of Y«êngchuƒÅn (). By 752, however, Chen was instead aligned with the rising Yang Guozhong‚Äîthe cousin of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan‚Äîagainst Li Linfu. When Li Linfu's close associate W√°ng H√≥ng () was implicated in a rebellion plot contrived by his brother W√°ng H√†n (), Li Linfu tried to extricate him, but Chen and Yang insisted that Wang Hong was guilty and should be further investigated, eventually leading to Wang Hong's being forced to commit suicide. Further, both Chen and Geshu Han also accused Li Linfu of associating with another general who rebelled around that time, the ethnically Tujue general L«ê Xi√†nzh≈çng (). This added to the apprehension that Li Linfu had at that point about Yang's rising power, and Li Linfu died in fear around the new year 753. After Li Linfu's death, Chen continued to serve as chancellor, along with Yang, but actual power was wielded by Yang. It was said that all important matters were decided at Yang's mansion, not at the office of the chancellors. Meanwhile, when Yang was able to successfully posthumously implicate Li Linfu in Li Xianzhong's rebellion, causing Li Linfu to be posthumously dishonored and his family to be exiled, Yang and Chen were created greater ducal titles‚Äîin Chen's case, the Duke of Xu‚Äîto award them for \\"discovering\\" Li Linfu's plot. Meanwhile, though, Yang was apprehensive of Chen as well, and therefore tried to squeeze him out of power entirely. Chen himself was apprehensive and therefore offered to resign. In 754, Emperor Xuanzong made Chen a senior advisor to his son Li Heng the Crown Prince and removed him from his chancellor position, replacing him with Wei Jiansu.  During Anshi Rebellion  In 755, the military governor (jiedushi) An Lushan rebelled at F√†ny√°ng. In 756, after declaring himself emperor of a new state of Yan, he advanced on the capital Chang'an, forcing Emperor Xuanzong to flee. After his forces entered Chang'an, Chen Xilie, who was distressed over not being in an important position at that time, submitted to An, along with the officials ZhƒÅng J≈´n () and ZhƒÅng J√¨ (). An had them delivered to Luoyang, which he had made his capital, and made Chen and Zhang Ji chancellors. In 757, by which time An Lushan's son ƒÄn Q√¨ngx√π was the emperor of Yan and L«ê Hƒìng was the emperor of Tang (as Emperor S√πz≈çng), Tang counterattacks, led by Emperor Suzong's son L«ê Ch√π the Prince of Gu«éngp√≠ng and with Uyghur assistance, recaptured Luoyang. Some 300 former Tang officials who had accepted Yan offices, including Chen, changed into mourning clothes and begged for forgiveness. Li Chu had them released, but soon had them escorted to Chang'an, which was by then again Tang's capital. After they formally paid respect to Emperor Suzong and apologized, they were delivered to the supreme court and placed under arrest. They were tried jointly by the officials L«ê Xi√†n, L«ö Yƒ´n, and Cuƒ´ Q√¨ (). Cui and L√º proposed that all of them be executed. Li Xian opposed, instead proposing six different grades of punishment, and Emperor Suzong accepted Li Xian's proposal. 18 officials were beheaded, while Chen and six others were ordered to commit suicide. It was said that Chen was allowed to commit suicide rather than being publicly executed because Emperor Suzong remembered how Emperor Xuanzong had favored him.

The dish consists of the broth/soup (guk) with thinly sliced rice cakes (tteok). It is tradition to eat tteokguk on New Year's Day because it is believed to grant the people good luck for the year and gain a year of age. It is usually garnished with thin julienned cooked eggs, marinated meat, and gim (ÍπÄ). Tteokguk at Doosan Encyclopedia History The origin of eating tteokguk on New Year's Day is unknown.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the second and last by Jack Snow. It was illustrated by Frank G. Kramer. The book entered the public domain in the United States when its copyright was not renewed as required.US Copyright Office. http://www.copyright.gov/ In The Shaggy Man of Oz as in his previous book, The Magical Mimics in Oz (1946), Snow returned to the Oz books of Baum for his inspiration and his conceptual framework. He avoided all use of characters and plot elements introduced in the Oz books of Ruth Plumly Thompson and John R. Neill, his predecessors in the post of \\"Royal Historian of Oz.\\" Shaggy Man and John Dough For his first Oz book, Snow had relied heavily upon Baum's The Emerald City of Oz. (Far from concealing it, Snow made the relationship between the two books clear in his text.) For his second venture, Snow depended upon Baum's 1906 novel John Dough and the Cherub.David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 79. In both books, the protagonists escape an exotic but risky place (in Baum, the Island of Phreex; in Snow, Conjo's island) in a borrowed flying machine; they travel to other places from which, in turn, they again need to escape. Baum has a Palace of Romance, and Snow, a Valley of Romance. In Baum's Hiland, the people are tall and thin and live in tall thin houses -- just as in Snow's Hightown. And in both novels, the heroes meet the King of the Fairy Beavers, who helps them to their final destination. Modernizing Though Snow relied on Baum's forty-year-old book for inspiration, he also faced a need to update the Oz enterprise. His first Oz book, launched in the post‚ÄìWorld War II world, had not been a commercial success; \\"Oz books appeared oddly old fashioned and less compelling in an era of rocket engines and atomic bombs.\\"Jack Snow, The Magical Mimics in Oz, with an Afterword by Michael Gessel, Kinderhook, IL, International Wizard of Oz Club, 1900; Afterword, p. 250. The second book stands in marked contrast to the first in terms of its trappings of modernity. The child protagonists are a contemporary American boy and girl; their father, Professor Jones, teaches physics at a university. The professor owns an early- model television set, and moreover has modified it with a large projection screen of his own design.The Shaggy Man of Oz, Chapter 1. Conjo the magician has an aircraft -- which flies not merely by \\"magic\\" but by anti-gravity plates. The episode in Hightown provides further consideration of gravity.The Shaggy Man of Oz, Chapters 6-8. Synopsis Abbadiah and Zebbidiah Jones are twins from Buffalo, New York; they prefer to go by their nicknames, Twink and Tom. The twins enjoy watching cowboy serials on the family TV set, customized by their scientist father with its own wall-sized projection screen. While the twins are watching the TV one afternoon, the normal picture changes into a strangely beautiful scene with a castle in the background. They are confronted by a living toy clown, a duplicate of the familiar toy they have named Twoffle. This living version, who calls himself Twiffle, persuades them to walk into the screen before them; the two children find themselves magically transported into the scene.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 217, 222-3. Twiffle explains that he is a third cousin of the twins' toy, Twoffle; the two have had long conversations about Twink and Tom while the children have slept. Twiffle serves a sorcerer named Conjo;Who's Who in Oz, p. 44. they are on Conjo's island in the Nonestic Ocean, and are heading toward Conjo's castle. Meanwhile, a problem has arisen in the Emerald City in Oz; the love magnet (introduced by Baum in his fifth Oz book, The Road to Oz) had been hanging above the city's entrance gate, but has now fallen from its nail and broken in two. Princess Ozma consults with the Shaggy Man, who first brought the talisman to Oz; they determine that the magnet can be repaired only by the magician who created it -- none other than Conjo. In the Magic Picture, they watch Twink and Tom approach Conjo's castle with Twiffle. Surprised at the presence of two human children, Ozma decides to send Shaggy there immediately to investigate. Ozma equips Shaggy with a magic compass that will return him to Oz whenever he chooses. (Ozma herself will be unavailable, sequestered with Glinda the Good as they work on deep magics.) Ozma transports Shaggy with her Magic Belt; he joins the children and Twiffle, much to their surprise. The four of them go to meet Conjo, who is short, fat, bald, and untrustworthy. Conjo agrees to repair the love magnet, though he wants Shaggy's magic compass in payment. The visitors stay the night; but Shaggy is awakened from sleep by a slight disturbance in his guest bedroom. He discovers that Conjo has repaired and surreptitiously returned the love magnet, but also has taken the magic compass. Twiffle insists that Conjo is not overtly evil, merely \\"selfish, lazy, and foolishly vain.\\" Yet Conjo has lured the twins to his island to rob them of their memories and use them as his servants, which is malicious enough. Shaggy, Twink, Tom, and Twiffle escape from the island in Conjo's Airmobile. They reach a sky country called Hightown, and the Airmobile is inadvertently lost, stranding them. They learn they can leave Hightown merely by swimming and walking down through the air, since gravity does not function in the place's vicinity. They next find their way to the Valley of Romance, where they stumble into a nightmare of incompetent amateur theater. Shaggy and Twink are bewitched into serving as cast members in an inept stage play. Tom and Twoffle manage to free them and break the spell of the place, by showing the love magnet to the Valley's king, queen, and assembled lords and ladies. (In Snow's narrative, the magnet has to be displayed to have its effect.) Traveling again, the four encounter the King of the Fairy Beavers.Who's Who in Oz, p. 121. The King agrees to help them reach Oz, if they invite him for a visit -- and Shaggy is happy to oblige. The protagonists and their beaver companions make their way under the Deadly Desert through the Nome King's tunnel (see The Emerald City of Oz). They pass the barrier of invisibility that shields Oz from the outside world, and arrive in Oz -- only to stumble into a crisis. Conjo has used the magic compass to reach Oz, where he grabs the Wizard's black bag of magic and locks himself in the Wizard's laboratory. Conjo wants to supplant the Wizard and gain control of Oz for himself. The Fairy Beaver King defeats Conjo with his water magic, squirting a jet of water from the Forbidden Fountain into Conjo's mouth. The now amnesiac Conjo is easy to manage and reform; he is returned to his island in Twiffle's care, for re-education. Twink and Tom enjoy a pleasant stay in Oz before Ozma sends them home once again.

(later retitled California: Gold Rush!) is a graphic adventure game originally released by Sierra On-Line in 1988. It was designed by Doug and Ken MacNeill. Gold Rush! is one of the last games that Sierra made with the AGI interface and is one of the most complicated. The rights to the game are currently owned and published by The Software Farm by its original developers the MacNeills.  Gameplay  The game is set in 1848, just before the California Gold Rush. The player is Brooklyn newspaperman Jerrod Wilson, who soon receives word that he must go to Sacramento to meet his long-lost brother. After a few minutes of gameplay, word arrives that gold has been found in California, and it becomes much more difficult for Jerrod to settle his affairs in Brooklyn and find a way to Sacramento. There are multiple paths which Jerrod can take to get to his brother. He can travel on a stagecoach, which is the cheapest path, and the only path that is always available to Jerrod, no matter how long he spends in Brooklyn. This path brings Jerrod into contact with Native Americans, unruly oxen, parching deserts, and the likelihood of a winter storm in the Sierra Nevada. He can travel on a ship to Panama, cross through treacherous swamps and jungles on foot, and catch another ship to Sacramento. This route is more expensive than the others and also requires Jerrod to prepare carefully for many hazards of the tropical climate of Panama, from malaria to jungle ants to crocodiles. The third‚Äîand most time-consuming‚Äîpath is to journey all the way around Cape Horn on a ship. This choice has its own perils, from storms to scurvy. In each route, Jerrod could perish at random by a disease to which there was no cure, such as cholera, forcing players to save their game whenever possible and in multiple slots. Once Jerrod arrives in Sacramento, the three routes converge and all of the puzzles are the same. Once in California, Jerrod must try to prospect for gold, avoid bandits, and locate his mysterious brother.  Copy protection  Gold Rush! used words from the manual as a form of copy protection. If the user failed to enter the correct word, their character would immediately be arrested for claim jumping and hanged on the gallows, which is the same as the regular in-game punishment for claim jumping, being caught in someone's hotel room, or stealing.  Reception  In 1989, Dragon gave the game 4¬Ω out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review, noting it mixes historical simulation with Sierra's traditional adventure gameplay. Compute! called Gold Rush \\"entertaining, somewhat educational, and a terrific escapade for first-time adventure game players\\", but warned that its simplicity might disappoint veteran gamers and that the graphics were inferior to that of some other Sierra adventures. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Gold Rush! the 96th- best adventure game ever released.  Legacy  Collector's edition = The Software Farm released a collector's edition of California: Gold Rush! in a wooden box in 2000. They also released an economy pack with just the game in an envelope. = Remake = The German game developer Sunlight Games secured the rights and re-released the original version on July 25, 2014. A remake with the named Gold Rush! Anniversary was released on November 7, 2014 for Microsoft Windows. OS X and Linux versions were released later in November 2014. The ports for iOS and Android were released in March 2015. All graphics are prerendered, but all animations and characters are displayed in real time 3D. The game's graphics are in high definition and the music was remade. All text from the original game was optimized with newly recorded voiceovers. The game can be controlled by a point and click control or with a parser (only Windows, Linux and Mac), which is similar to the old Sierra games which use the AGI interface. Gold Rush! 2 was released in April 2017 as a sequel to Gold Rush! Anniversary. Sunlight Games has released a limited Special Edition, which is limited to 350 pieces. The content of this box which is similar to the old Sierra boxes is: a box with a banderole, a copy on DVD which is DRM- free, a poster, a card with the serial number, a printed making-of booklet, a printed booklet with concept drawings and a golden-colored coin in the design of Gold Rush! The Special Edition can only be ordered at Sunlight Games' online shop. Adventure Gamers gave the remake 1¬Ω stars out of 5. Just Adventure gave the game B-. 3rd-strike gave the game 7.0.

Frank Baum and his successors, and the first written and illustrated solely by John R. Neill.John R. Neill, The Wonder City of Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1940; New York, Books of Wonder, 1990. Tone With The Wonder City of Oz, Neill introduced a change in tone that continued through his subsequent books. Neill's Oz books \\"are highly imaginative, but the imagination is undisciplined; each book, in fact, has enough ideas to fill several.\\"David L. Greene and Dick Martin, The Oz Scrapbook, New York, Random House, 1977; p. 77. Neill's Emerald City has skyscrapers and gas stations. Normally inanimate objects act alive: houses talk and fight, shoes sing (they have tongues), and clocks run. The plot Jenny Jump captures a leprechaun named Siko Pompus (apparently a pun on \\"psychopomp\\") and forces him to make her into a fairy; but he only does half the job before escaping. Jenny then jumps to Oz using her half-fairy gifts. She lands in the carriage of Princess Ozma during a parade -- and quickly expresses her desire to be a queen herself. Jenny displays a bold and tempestuous nature; when she loses her temper she spits flames from her mouth. Yet she is also enterprising and resourceful; she soon sets up a Style Shop with a magic turnstile which gives fashion makeovers (the turnstile turns styles). Jenny half-adopts a munchkin boy called Number Nine (he's the ninth of fourteen children); he is overwhelmed by the force of her personality, and she treats him like a slave. Jenny's disruptive nature quickly becomes apparent. In response, the Wizard removes her fairy abilities and starts making her younger. Jenny has her good points too: she saves the Emerald City from conquest by an army of chocolate soldiers. Yet her ambition lures her into running against Ozma in an Ozlection to become ruler of the Land of Oz. It is clear that Ozma will win any fair election by a landslide -- but a landslide is a terribly dangerous thing to have in the Emerald City. So Prof. Wogglebug cooks up a more random choice, in which citizens are weighed on scales to determine their votes. In the end, the Ozlection is exactly a tie, with a precisely equal number of votes cast for Ozma and for Jenny Jump. Only one person has yet to vote: the leprechaun Siko Pompus. He assures Jenny that he is her friend, and then he steps forward to cast the deciding vote...for Ozma. (He claims it's for Jenny's own good, to save her \\"a heap of responsibility.\\") Jenny is so irate at this outcome that she causes chaos in the city: she releases the tigers from tiger-lilies, the bulls from bullrushes, the lions from dandy-lions, etc., to rampage through the streets. The Wizard resolves matters with his magic: he extracts Jenny's bad temper, envy, and ambition, so that these faults no longer plague her. (He makes these faults visible for Number Nine, Dorothy, and other assembled friends: bad temper is a black wasp, envy is a green snake, and ambition is a fat red toad.) Jenny is delighted with the change in her: \\"How grand I feel!\\" Ozma and Glinda make Jenny a Duchess of Oz; and she is now young and carefree enough to be a fitting companion for Number Nine. Finally, Jenny's leprechaun godfather gives her back her fairy gifts, in externalized and material forms: \\"an ivory-handled eyeglass for one eye\\" that provides fairy sight, and a pair of rose-colored gloves, \\"a golden slipper for her left foot, and a pair of thistle-down earmuffs\\" that enable her other fairy powers, whenever she needs them. Editorial interference The Ozlection storyline, with its shoes-as- votes scenario, was not written by Neill but by an anonymous editor who found portions of Neill's version of the book inadequate. None of the incidents in this plot thread is illustrated by Neill. Geography In a prefatory note addressed to the book's child readers, Neill states that he and his family live in Flanders, New Jersey, which he describes as \\"on top of the Schooley Mountains and the Jenny Jump Mountains are really truly mountains right next to us.\\" He characterizes them as \\"wonderful mountains for fairies to hide in.\\" As Neill indicates, Jenny Jump Mountain is a real place, located in northwestern New Jersey in the Jenny Jump State Forest.

Early history of steelmaking in Sydney An integrated steel mill was established on the southeast side of Sydney Harbour in the Whitney Pier neighbourhood of Sydney, Nova Scotia in 1901 by American investors. This entity was named Dominion Iron and Steel Company Limited (DISCO). Coal from the Dominion Coal Company Limited (DOMCO) was used to create coke to fuel the blast furnaces for smelting iron ore which arrived from Bell Island in Newfoundland. In 1920, DISCO, the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company (SCOTIA) in Sydney Mines, and the Wabana ore mine on Bell Island were acquired by the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO). In 1930, BESCO reorganized as Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO). Hawker Siddeley Canada purchased DOSCO in 1957. Donald Commission Hawker Siddeley sought to eliminate money losing operations and in 1965, DOSCO announced that its mines had only 15 years of production left and concluded that the cost of opening new underground mines in the Sydney Coal Field would be too expensive. The company made its intentions clear that it would be exiting the coal mining business within months. DOSCO's continued operation of its steel mill, lacking modernization and far removed from the steel markets of the midwest and central Canada, was tentative at best. In response to a vast public outcry in industrial Cape Breton County, the Minority government of Prime Minister Lester Pearson announced J.R. Donald would head a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Cape Breton coal industry, with hearings held in 1965 and 1966. The Donald Commission recommended that a federal Crown corporation be established to acquire and manage DOSCO's coal operations, with the aim being to slowly wean the Sydney area economy off the coal industry. ::\\"Future planning should be based on the assumption that the Sydney mines will not operate beyond 1981.\\" On July 7, 1967 the Cape Breton Development Corporation, or DEVCO, was established to operate the mines in the interim, while phasing them out throughout the 1970s and, at the same time, develop new economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. Nationalization On December 1, 1967, the provincial government established Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO) under an act of the provincial legislature. to operate DOSCO's steel mill for a period of 12 months until the steel mill could be resold to another private operator. On March 30, 1968 DEVCO expropriated DOSCO's coal mines and the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, settling for a payment of $12 million. The federal government's plans to gradually shut down coal operations during the 1970s were derailed by rising world energy prices and changes in political priorities. Similarly, the provincial government's 1-year temporary commitment to transitioning ownership of the steel mill from DOSCO turned into a 33-year commitment, adding over $1 billion to the cash-strapped province's debt. SYSCO became a political football for economically depressed Industrial Cape Breton and no provincial government dared to shut it down, opting instead to use heavily subsidized federally produced DEVCO coal for coking fuel to continue running the antiquated mill. Over time, the provincial government gave limited capital investments to SYSCO from the late 1970s into the early 1980s. In the mid-1980s the provincial government of premier John Buchanan decided to modernize the steel mill prior to selling it to the private sector. This modernization changed the steel making process from a fully integrated oxygen blast plant using iron ore into an electric arc mini mill using scrap steel. The blast process fuelled by coke was mothballed in favour of using electricity to smelt the scrap recycled metal brought in by rail. Closure With no purchasers from the private sector and tumultuous steel markets during the 1990s, the provincial government began to seek ways to rid itself of SYSCO. Numerous proposals for sale to foreign and domestic companies came and went, raising and lowering the hopes of Sydney and its surrounding area each time announcements were made and then promises broken. Finally, the Progressive Conservative government of John Hamm opted to sever provincial funding for the company entirely upon being elected in 1999. In July 2001, it was announced that SYSCO's mini mill was being sold to an Indian company named Zoom Developers who planned to dismantle it and ship it overseas. Despite worker protests, SYSCO's steel production was shut down that year and the workers have been helping to dismantle the entire facility for site remediation. Environmental legacy Until the mid-1980s, SYSCO along with its predecessors, Hawker Siddeley, DOSCO, BESCO, and DOMCO/DISCO, was a user of coke as a fuel for the mill's blast furnaces. Coke is produced by slowly baking coal, evaporating or leaching out various liquids in the process. The coke ovens used in Sydney were located across Victoria Road from the steel mill and since 1967 were operated by the federal Crown corporation DEVCO, which also operated the mines that produced the coal supply. The associated run-off from these coke ovens over a period of 85 years ended up in the Muggah Creek tidal estuary downhill from the coke ovens and adjacent to the steel mill, creating the Sydney Tar Ponds. Site remediation was carried out by Nova Scotia Lands Incorporated and Harbourside Commercial Park Inc., a Crown corporation formed to redevelop the site as a commercial and industrial estate. The cleanup was completed in 2013 with the opening of Harbourside Commercial Park and Open Hearth Park, which are situated on the site of the former Sydney Steel Corporation. Open Hearth Park features a playground and soccer field, and has hosted events such as a concert by international recording stars Aerosmith in September 2014. In 2006, Carole Lee Boutilier, founder of the Sydney Steel Plant Museum, contributed a sample of steel rail to the Six String Nation project.

Frank Baum and continued by his successors; it is the second volume in the series both written and illustrated by John R. Neill.John R. Neill, The Scalawagons of Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1941; New York, Books of Wonder, 1991. Bell-snickle The antagonist of Neill's plot is a mysterious monstrosity called Bell-snickle.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; p. 15. (The term \\"villain\\" is an overstatement, since the creature is mostly a pest, or as the Wizard calls it, a \\"nuisance.\\") It first appears as \\"a large bluish-green object, flat as a buckwheat cake, and rolling along on its edge like a cartwheel.\\"The Scalawagons of Oz, p. 41. The creature does have arms and legs, as well as facial features; it wears bells on its ears, explaining at least one portion of its name. (The thing has no apparent relation to the Belsnickel of Christmas lore, except their common nomenclature.) Neill gives no account of Bell-snickle's origin and no explanation of its nature or abilities. The creature prides itself on being a \\"mystery,\\" and attacks anything that shares that designation. It has the egotism and petulance of a spoiled child. The plot In Scalawagons, Neill exploits two characters he introduced in his previous book, The Wonder City of Oz, Number Nine and Jenny Jump.Who's Who is Oz, pp. 108, 146. Jenny is the book's protagonist, though the story begins with Number Nine, who is now an assistant to the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard has a tendency to disappear suddenly, as he pursues various projects. His latest project is the creation of a new form of transportation for the Land of Oz. In a red-domed facility atop Carrot Mountain in the Quadling Country, the Wizard has established a factory to build scalawagons, intelligent cars that can also fly. (They spread their running boards like wings.) In his illustrations, Neill makes them resemble the \\"kiddie cars\\" of amusement-park rides; their heads are in turrets on their roofs. The Wizard makes Tik-Tok the superintendent of the scalawagon factory. The scalawagons are conscious, but not very smart; Tik-Tok pounds sense into them with a rubber mallet. His new duties wear on the mechanical man, however, and he runs down sooner than expected. Bell-snickle finds the factory; bent on mischief, the monster knocks the stationary Tik-Tok out a window. Bell-snickle ignores Tik-Tok's warning signs, and fuels the scalawagons with \\"flabber-gas\\" (apparently a pun on the word \\"flabbergast\\"); they quickly fly away. In the disorder, Bell-snickle is soaked in the fluid; blown up like a balloon, he/she/it sails away into the sky -- and disappears from the plot for ten chapters. (\\"Flabber-gas\\" is a liquid -- \\"gas\\" as in gasoline -- but has the effect of lighter-than air gasses like hydrogen and helium.) The palace of Glinda the Good is located not far away; from her Great Book of Records Glinda learns of the scalawagons' existence and their escape. A party sets out to investigate, consisting of Jenny Jump, The Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Sawhorse. The four are quickly involved in chaotic adventures, complicated by the Sawhorse's tendency to race off uncontrolled, and involving a menagerie of beings that includes \\"Lollies\\" and their \\"Pops,\\" water spirits and kelpies, talking animals and a grumpy grandfather clock. Jenny Jump uses her fairy powers to take to the air, and meets a group of fairy bell-ringers, the Nota-bells. When Number Nine joins Jenny, they find and wind up Tik-Tok, and eventually locate the scalawagons flying over the Deadly Desert and herd them back to Oz. Bell- snickle returns to cause more trouble. It comes to dominate a stand of walking talking trees, and drives them toward the Emerald City in a vain attempt at conquest. At the gate of the city, the Tin Woodman terrifies the trees with his axe, and the threat is quickly disposed of. Bell-snickle is captured, and is cowed into agreeing to a new way of life: Jenny runs the monster through the turnstile of her style shop until it is reduced to a rubber stamp. Ozma also uses the converted monster as a stopper, to stop trends she doesn't approve. The Nota-bells are given quarters in a high tower of Ozma's palace, where they supply pleasant music to the city below. The story ends with a great party and dance. A weak plot and the lack of a compelling villain make The Scalawagons of Oz one of the most random and disorganized of the Oz books. Puns Baum introduced pun-dependent humor into the Oz books from the start of the series; Neill carried punning farther than any other Oz writer. The prose in Scalawagons is often a tissue of puns; a few of the puns are not terrible. In the course of her adventures, Jenny Jump lands in a field of conscious and talkative potatoes; they are ruled by a spud named Dick -- he is their \\"Dick Tater.\\"The Scalawagons of Oz, pp. 203-8. Late in the book, the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman enjoy \\"a game of squash\\" -- which they play \\"with ripe bananas and brickbats.\\"The Scalawagons of Oz, p. 262.

L-R: Muff Winwood, Spencer Davis, Pete York, and Steve Winwood  background = group_or_band  origin = Birmingham, England  genre = The Spencer Davis Group were a British rock band formed in Birmingham in 1963, by Spencer Davis (guitar) with Steve Winwood (keyboards, guitar) and his brother, Muff Winwood (bass guitar) and Pete York (drums). Their best known songs include the UK number ones \\"Somebody Help Me\\" and \\"Keep on Running\\" (both written by reggae musician Jackie Edwards), \\"I'm a Man\\" and \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\", which reached #2 in the UK and #7 in the US. Steve Winwood left in 1967 to form Traffic. After releasing a few more singles, the band ceased to be active in 1968. Davis refounded the group on two more occasions, without the involvement of the Winwood brothers, first in 1973‚Äì1974 for two more albums, and again from 2006, since when they have primarily been a touring act. Davis died on 19 October 2020, effectively ending the band. HistoryFormation= The Spencer Davis Group was formed in 1963 in Birmingham after the Welsh guitarist Spencer Davis encountered vocalist and organist Steve Winwood (then aged 14 and still at school), and his bass playing brother Muff Winwood performing at a pub, the Golden Eagle, as the Muff Woody Jazz Band. He recruited them and Pete York on drums to form the Rhythm and Blues Quartette, which performed regularly in the city. In 1964, they signed their first recording contract after Chris Blackwell of Island Records saw them at an appearance in a local club; Blackwell also became their producer. (Island was then a small independent label with UK Fontana contracted for distribution.) Muff Winwood came up with the band's name, reasoning, \\"Spencer was the only one who enjoyed doing interviews, so I pointed out that if we called it the Spencer Davis Group, the rest of us could stay in bed and let him do them.\\"Black, Johnny (May 1997). Feature: Steve Winwood , Mojo. =Breakthrough success= The group's first professional recording was a cover version of \\"Dimples\\". At the end of 1965 they gained their first number one single with \\"Keep On Running\\". In 1966, they followed this with \\"Somebody Help Me\\" and \\"When I Come Home\\". They had one single issued in the US on Fontana, as well as \\"Keep On Running\\" and \\"Somebody Help Me\\" on Atco, but due to lack of promotion, none of these singles gained airplay or entered the American charts. For the German market, the group released a medley of \\"Det war in Sch√∂neberg, im Monat Mai\\" and \\"M√§del ruck ruck ruck an meine gr√ºne Seite\\" (the first is from a 1913 Berlin operetta, the second is a Swabian traditional) as a tribute single for that audience, Davis having studied in West Berlin in the early 1960s. By the end of 1966 and the beginning of 1967, the group released two more hits, \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" and \\"I'm a Man\\". Both of them sold over one million copies, and were awarded gold record status. These tracks proved to be their two best- known successes, especially in the U.S. (where they had signed to United Artists). Jimmy Miller was their producer. The group starred in The Ghost Goes Gear (1966), a British musical comedy film, directed by Hugh Gladwish, and also featuring Sheila White and Nicholas Parsons. The plot involved the group in a stay at the childhood home of their manager, a haunted manor house in the English countryside. The film would later be considered a mistake by Winwood. =Disbandment= The Spencer Davis Group in 1974 Steve Winwood left to form Traffic in 1967; his brother, Muff, moved into the music industry working in Artists and repertoire (A&R;) at Island Records. In the same period, both the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic featured on the soundtrack of the film Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush released in that year. After the Winwoods' departures, the Spencer Davis Group continued with the addition of guitarist Phil Sawyer (ex-Les Fleur de Lys) and keyboardist/vocalist Eddie Hardin (ex-A Wild Uncertainty). This line-up recorded several tunes for Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush and released the psychedelia sounding, \\"Time Seller\\" single in July 1967; the b-side, \\"Don't Want You No More\\", also received radio airplay. This was followed by \\"Mr. Second-Class\\" in late 1967, which received heavy airplay on Radio Caroline (a pirate radio ship off the British coast), and the album With Their New Face On in 1968. At that time Ray Fenwick had replaced Phil Sawyer. The group's last minor hit, \\"After Tea\\", was released at the same time by the German band The Rattles, providing competition that led finally to a temporary stop to all activities of the band. The song was originally recorded by the Dutch group After Tea, which included guitarist/singer Fenwick amongst its members. After one further single (\\"Short Change\\"), at that time Eddie Hardin and Pete York had left to form the duo Hardin & York. They were replaced by future Elton John band member Dee Murray on bass and Dave Hynes on drums. Nigel Olsson replaced Hynes, and this lineup produced the album Funky in 1969 (only released in the USA on Date Records, a subsidiary of CBS) before splintering. The group broke up on 19 July 1969.Dick Clark's Rock, Roll & Remember, 19 July 2003. =Solo work and reunions= The group reunited in 1973 with Davis, Fenwick, Hardin and York, and newcomer Charlie McCracken on bass. The group released the albums Gluggo (1973) and Living in a Back Street (1974) before once again disbanding. Davis continued working, however, producing some jazz-oriented albums in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The band re-formed in 2006, although only Davis and Hardin remained from the 1960s group line-ups. Since then, The Spencer Davis Group has continued to tour the USA and Europe, but with two differing line-ups; only Spencer Davis himself is present in both formations of the band. Hardin remained with the UK version of the band until his death in 2015. Davis died in California on 19 October 2020, at the age of 81, while being treated for pneumonia. Cover versions of songs The Spencer Davis Group ‚Äì particularly its incarnation with Steve Winwood ‚Äì proved to be influential, with many of the band's songs being recorded by other artists over the years. Among these are Chicago's cover of \\"I'm a Man\\"; The Allman Brothers Band's version of Davis and Hardin‚Äôs \\"Don't Want You No More\\" (both 1969); Three Dog Night's recording of \\"Can't Get Enough of It\\" (1970); and The Blues Brothers' \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" (1980). The Grateful Dead also covered Spencer Davis Group material in live performance on occasion, and Spencer Davis himself performed \\"I'm a Man\\" with the Grateful Dead in a 1989 performance at Los Angeles' Great Western Forum.

Background  Wei Jiansu was born in 687, during the first reign of Emperor Ruizong. His family was from the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an, and traced its ancestry to a line of officials of the Han Dynasty, Cao Wei, Northern Zhou, Sui Dynasty, and Tang. Wei JIansu's grandfather Wei Fu () served as a prefectural prefect, and his father Wei Cou () served as an official during the reigns of Emperor Ruizong's father Emperor Gaozong, mother Wu Zetian, brother Emperor Zhongzong, Emperor Ruizong himself, and Emperor Ruizong's son Emperor Xuanzong, being known for his honesty and bluntness.New Book of Tang, vol. 74.Old Book of Tang, vol. 108 . Wei JIansu himself passed the imperial examinations, and during Jinglong era of Emperor Zhongzong (707-710), he served as a military officer at the mansion of Emperor Ruizong, who was then the Prince of Dan. He later served as a guard commander, and then the officer in charge of storage at Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥ÂçóÂ∫ú, encompassing the eastern capital Luoyang).  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  Wei Cou died during Emperor Xuanzong's Kaiyuan era (713-741), and Wei Jiansu left public service to observe a mourning period. Once the mourning period was over, he became the secretary general of the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂØ∫‰∏û, Dali Sicheng), and inherited his father's title of Duke of Pengcheng. At one point, he was accused of an offense lost in history and was demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Fang Prefecture (ÂùäÂ∑û, in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). He was subsequently recalled to be a low level official at the ministry of treasury and given the honorific title Chaosan Daifu (). He then served at the ministry of defense, before he became Jianyi Daifu (), a consultant at either the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) or the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng). In 746, Wei was made the examiner of the Jiangxi, Shannan (Â±±Âçó, i.e., modern northern Hubei), Qianzhong (Èªî‰∏≠, i.e., modern Guizhou and western Hunan), and Lingnan regions, to tour the regions to examine the customs of the regions and find officials to promote or demote. It was said that wherever he went, he was stern, and the officials were also led into being stern. Upon his return to Chang'an, he was made Jishizhong (), an imperial attendant. He subsequently served as acting deputy minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Gongbu Shilang), and then Shangshu You Cheng (), one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). In 750, he was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang) and given the honorific title Yinqing Guanglu Daifu (). It was said that Wei was kind and forgiving, and that he was fair in selecting officials while serving as the deputy minister of civil service affairs. Meanwhile, at this time, the chancellors Yang Guozhong and Chen Xilie were not on good relations, and Emperor Xuanzong did not find Chen to be an appropriate chancellor. In 754, Chen thus resigned, and initially, Emperor Xuanzong wanted to replace him with Ji Wen (). Yang opposed, because Ji was then aligned with An Lushan, with whom Yang also had a rivalry. Yang consulted the officials Bao Hua () and Song Yu (), both of whom told Yang that Wei was elegant but easy to control. Yang thus recommended Wei, and Emperor Xuanzong, remembering Wei's service to Emperor Ruizong while Emperor Ruizong was the Prince of Dan, agreed. In fall 754, Emperor Xuanzong thus made Wei the minister of defense (Ê≠¶ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Wubu Shangshu) with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. He also made Wei an imperial scholar at Jixian Institute () and put him in charge of the examination bureau. It was said that because Yang recommended Wei, Wei followed his directions, and that he did nothing to moderate the growing conflict between Yang and An, eventually leading to An's rebellion in 755. In 756, after An's forward forces defeated and captured the Tang general Geshu Han at Tong Pass, Emperor Xuanzong, under Yang's advice, decided to abandon Chang'an and flee to Jiannan Circuit (ÂäçÂçó, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). On July 13,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ the imperial train, without announcing to the people of Chang'an, left Chang'an, with Emperor Xuanzong attended to by the imperial clan members, Yang, Wei Jiansu, the official Wei Fangjin (), the general Chen Xuanli (), and eunuchs and ladies in waiting close to the emperor. On July 15,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ Emperor Xuanzong's train reached Mawei Station (È¶¨Âµ¨È©õ, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). The imperial guards were not fed and were angry at Yang Guozhong. Chen also believed that Yang Guozhong provoked this disaster and planned to carry him‚Äîand reported his plans to Li Heng through Li Heng's eunuch Li Fuguo, but Li Heng was hesitated and gave no approval. Meanwhile, though, Tufan emissaries, who followed Emperor Xuanzong south, were meeting with Yang Guozhong and complaining that they were also not fed. The imperial guard soldiers took this opportunity to proclaim that Yang Guozhong was planning treason along with the Tufan emissaries, and they killed him, along with his son Yang Xuan (), the Ladies of Han and Qin, and Wei Fangjin. Wei Jiansu was also nearly killed, but was spared at the last moment with severe injuries. The soldiers then surrounded Emperor Xuanzong's pavilion, and refused to scatter even after Emperor Xuanzong came out to comfort them and order them to scatter. Chen publicly urged him to put Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine and Yang Guozhong's cousin Consort Yang Yuhuan to death‚Äîwhich Emperor Xuanzong initially declined. After Wei Jiansu's son Wei E () and Gao Lishi spoke further, Emperor Xuanzong finally resolved to do so. He therefore had Gao take Consort Yang to a Buddhist shrine and strangle her there. Emperor Xuanzong had Li Mao () the Prince of Shou visit Wei Jiansu and give him medication.New Book of Tang, vol. 118. After the Yangs' death, Wei Jiansu was the only remaining high-level official in the imperial train, and the remaining generals had differences in opinion about what to do next‚Äîwith many not wanting to proceed further to Jiannan because Yang was the military governor (jiedushi) of Jiannan, and therefore they saw Jiannan as a potential trap. There were therefore various suggestions: to flee to Hexi (Ê≤≥Ë•ø, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu) and Longyou (Èö¥Âè≥, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) Circuits; to flee to Lingwu; to flee to Taiyuan; and to return to Chang'an. Emperor Xuanzong was intent on still going to Jiannan, but did not dare to offend the soldiers. At Wei E's suggestion, he proceeded to Fufeng (Êâ∂È¢®, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), leaving Li Heng the Crown Prince behind as rear guard‚Äîbut Li Heng was subsequently detained by the soldiers, who believed that a counterattack should be launched, and eventually departed from Emperor Xuanzong and proceeded to Lingwu. After Li Heng's departure, Emperor Xuanzong continued his trek south, but the soldiers were unhappy, some going as far as cursing the emperor. Fortuitously, though, a large cache of silk that Shu Commandery (ËúÄÈÉ°, roughly modern Chengdu) arrived. Emperor Xuanzong declared to the soldiers that it was his fault that a rebellion occurred, and that the soldiers should take the silk and then return home and let just the imperial train go to Shu Commandery. The soldiers were touched, and no longer considered rebelling against the emperor. In fall 756, after Emperor Xuanzong reached Baxi Commandery (Â∑¥Ë•ø, roughly modern Mianyang, Sichuan), he made Wei, in addition to being the minister of defense, Zuo Xiang () -- the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. When they reached Shu Commandery, Emperor Xuanzong further created him the Duke of Bin and gave him the honorific title Jinzi Guanglu Daifu ().  During Emperor Suzong's reign  Meanwhile, Li Heng had declared himself emperor at Lingwu (as Emperor Suzong). When Emperor Suzong's messengers reached Emperor Xuanzong, he gave public approval and took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor). He sent Wei Jiansu and other chancellors Fang Guan, and Cui Huan to Lingwu to official invest Emperor Suzong as emperor and gave them the imperial seal and the edict officially passing the throne. They encountered Emperor Suzong, who was then launching a counterattack, at Shunhua (È†ÜÂåñ, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), and they offered the seal and the edict to Emperor Suzong. Emperor Suzong declined, stating that with empire still in turmoil, it was not an appropriate time for him to officially take the throne, instead putting the seal and the edict aside and paying them daily respects, as they represented Emperor Xuanzong. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Suzong had been impressed with Fang's reputation and therefore particularly honored Fang, giving him most of the responsibilities. In contrast, Emperor Suzong was displeased with how Wei had followed Yang Guozhong's directions and therefore did not pay him much respect, although he allowed Wei to remain chancellor for some time. In spring 757, Wei was made Zuo Puye (), one of the heads of the executive bureau, and removed from his chancellor post. He was subsequently made a senior advisor to the crown prince.However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary. After Emperor Suzong recaptured Chang'an in fall 757, he sent Wei to Shu to escort Emperor Xuanzong back to Chang'an. After Wei brought Emperor Xuanzong back to Chang'an, he was given the honorific title Kaifu Yitong Sansi (). In Emperor Suzong's Shangyuan era (760-761), Wei requested to retire on account of a foot ailment, and Emperor Suzong allowed him to do so. He died around the new year 763, briefly after Emperor Suzong himself had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong. Wei was given posthumous honors and given an official burial.

Early life Davis was born in Swansea, South Wales. His father was a paratrooper. He began learning to play harmonica and accordion at the age of six. He attended Dynevor School, and became proficient in languages. He moved to London when he was sixteen, and began working in the civil service as a clerical officer at the Post Office Savings Bank in Hammersmith, and for HM Customs and Excise. However, he went back to his old school to study for A-levels in languages, becoming Head Boy in 1959. In 1960, he moved to Birmingham, to read German at the University of Birmingham. In music circles, Davis was later known as \\"Professor\\". Early music career His early musical influences were skiffle, jazz, and blues. Influential artists include Big Bill Broonzy, Huddy Ledbetter, Buddy Holly, Davey Graham, John Martyn, Alexis Korner and Long John Baldry. By the time he was sixteen, Davis was hooked on the guitar and the American rhythm and blues music making its way across the Atlantic. With few opportunities to hear R&B; in South Wales, Davis attended as many local gigs as practical. Davis formed a band called The Saints, with Bill Perks, later known as Bill Wyman. When Davis moved to Birmingham, as a student he often performed on stage after his teaching work day was finished. While in Birmingham, he formed a musical and personal relationship with Christine Perfect, who later found fame in Fleetwood Mac. The Spencer Davis Group Spencer Davis (guitar) rehearsing in Amsterdam (1966); Muff Winwood on bass In 1963, Davis went to the Golden Eagle, Birmingham, to see the Muff Wood Jazz band, a traditional jazz band featuring Muff and teenager Steve Winwood.

Davis performed on guitar, vocals and harmonica, Steve Winwood on guitar, organ and vocals, Muff Winwood on bass, and Pete York on drums. They adopted the name The Spencer Davis Group, because Davis was the only one who liked doing press interviews. The group had No 1 hits in the UK with consecutive single releases in 1966 (\\"Keep On Running\\" and \\"Somebody Help Me\\"). Steve Winwood sang lead vocals on all the Spencer Davis Group's hits up to \\"I'm A Man\\" in 1967. The Spencer Davis Group continued after Winwood left to form Traffic in April 1967. The group recorded two more albums before splitting in 1969. Another version of the group with Davis and York appeared in 1973 and disbanded in late 1974. Various incarnations of the band toured in later years, under Davis' direction. Solo career After the group broke up, Davis moved to California and recorded an acoustic album with Peter Jameson, It's Been So Long, for Mediarts in mid-1971. He followed it with a solo album Mousetrap for United Artists, produced by and featuring Sneaky Pete Kleinow. Neither album sold well. Soon after, he moved back to the UK, formed a new Spencer Davis Group and signed with Vertigo Records. In addition, Davis was an executive at Island records in the mid-1970s. Working as a promoter for Island Records, Davis worked with Bob Marley, Robert Palmer and Eddie And The Hot Rods as well as promoting the solo career of former Spencer Davis Group member, Steve Winwood. In 1993, Davis formed the supergroup the Class Rock All-Stars. He left the group in 1995 to form World Classic Rockers with former Eagles bassist Randy Meisner, singer Bobby Kimball and guitarist Denny Laine. Later life Davis retained an affinity for Germany having studied the language and played in clubs in Berlin early in his career. He watched the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 with his son. David was an honorary member and supporter of the Wales nationalist party, Plaid Cymru. Since the mid-1970s, Davis lived in Avalon on Catalina Island, a small island in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California. Davis died from pneumonia on 19 October 2020 at the age of 81.

More specifically, forgery creates a falsified document and uttering is the act of knowingly passing on or using the forged document. Background In the law of countries whose legal systems derive from English common law, uttering is a crime similar to forgery. Uttering and forgery were originally common law offences, both misdemeanours. Forgery was the creation of a forged document, with the intent to defraud; whereas uttering was merely use ‚Äì the passing ‚Äì of a forged document, that someone else had made, with the intent to defraud. In law, uttering is synonymous with publication, and the distinction made between the common law offences was that forgery was the fabrication of a forged instrument (with the intent to defraud) and uttering was the publication of that instrument (with the intent to defraud). Statute law offences of forgery replace the common law offences nowadays, often subsuming the offence of uttering, and, where the distinction exists, forgery is usually a felony rather than a misdemeanour. Canada Uttering a forged document is a criminal offence in Canada, contrary to s 368 of the Criminal Code. It is an indictable offence and is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 368. United KingdomEngland and Wales and Northern Ireland= See section 36 of the Forgery Act 1861. History See section 6 of the Forgery Act 1913. Section 29(1)(i) of the Larceny Act 1916 formerly created the offence of uttering a letter or writing demanding property with menaces. =Scotland= In Scotland, uttering forged writings is a crime defined as \\"using as genuine a fabricated writing falsely intended to pass as genuine the writing of another person\\". United States In the U.S., uttering is the act of offering a forged document to another when the offeror has knowledge that the document is forged. Uttering does not require that the person who presented the document actually forged or altered the document. For example, forging a log for personal profit might be considered uttering and publishing. Another example would be the forging of a university diploma. As an example of the law itself, the State of Michigan defines the offense (MCL 750.249): \\"Any person who utters and publishes as true any false, forged, altered or counterfeit record, deed, instrument or other writing specified, knowing it to be false, altered, forged, or counterfeit, with intent to injure or defraud is guilty of uttering and publishing.\\"People v Cassadime - Michigan Appellate Digest, 9 September 2003 Forging or illegal \\"publishing\\" of an official or unofficial document is not the essence of uttering. Uttering is the actual presentation of forged or official documentation as one's own.

It broadcasts the CBC Radio One network to most of southern Saskatchewan. Its studios are located at the CBC's broadcast centre at 2440 Broad Street in Regina, with an additional bureau in Saskatoon on 4th Avenue South. The Regina facility also houses CBK-FM and CBKT-DT. Transmitter and signal When the CBC established CBK, it located the transmitter in Watrous, about 150 kilometres (90 miles) northwest of Regina and about 100 kilometres (60 miles) southeast of Saskatoon.FCCdata.org/CBK The site, off Agnes Street, was chosen to provide the best possible AM broadcast signal to the densely populated portion of Saskatchewan, including both cities. CBK operates as a Class A clear-channel station, operating at 50,000 watts around the clock from a non-directional transmitter in Watrous. Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial, high transmitter power and Saskatchewan's mostly flat land (with near-perfect soil conductivity), CBK's daytime signal reaches most of the southern two-thirds of the province, including Regina, Saskatoon, Yorkton, Swift Current, Lloydminster, Moose Jaw and Prince Albert. It also provides grade B coverage as far west as Calgary and as far east as Winnipeg, and reaches across the border into North Dakota and Montana. At night, it can be heard across much of the western half of North America with a good radio, but is strongest in Western Canada and the North-Central and Northwestern United States. Mexico also has a Class A station on 540 AM, XEWA in San Luis Potos√≠, so CBK's signal is harder to receive closer to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. History CBK was launched by the CBC in 1939, serving most of Saskatchewan from the single transmitter site. It was originally intended as the CBC's clear-channel station for the Prairies. (CKY in Winnipeg, now CBW, was also a clear-channel, but was a privately-owned CBC Network affiliate at the time.) At first, CBK aired no local shows. All programming was initially fed from Toronto, then after 1948 from Winnipeg. A local studio didn't open until 1954, on Broad Street in Regina. For most of World War II, CBK aired programming in both English and French. CBK was almost forced to move its dial location in 1947, when the International Telecommunications Conference considered designating 540 for low-powered stations. Eventually, the ITC agreed to allow CBK to stay on 540 until an alternate location could be found. In 1975 the original tube powered transmitter built by RCA was replaced by a solid state transmitter. The following year on June 4, 1976 CBK's transmitting tower was toppled by strong winds during a thunderstorm. CBK's staff went back on the air in the cities of Regina and Saskatoon by temporarily taking over CBC's low powered FM transmitters normally used to air French language programming. Within a few days, the 540 kHz signal was restored using a temporary tower while a new permanent one was built. One of the station's distinctive features was its Art Deco style transmitter building in Watrous. It featured a studio to keep the station on the air in the event of an emergency, living quarters for station staff, a map of Canada showing CBC stations and private affiliates, and an underground fallout shelter with a studio to broadcast news in the event of a nuclear attack. In 2007 the transmitting equipment was moved from the original transmitter building to a steel shed next to the tower. There was an effort by the town of Watrous to designate the transmitter a historic site. In recent years the original transmitter building has been vacant and has fallen into disrepair. Due to the cost to high cost of removing dangerous materials such as asbestos and lead paint, CBC Saskatchewan decided to demolish the transmitter building in August 2015, rather than restore it. Local programming CBK and its repeater stations air several local shows, in addition to CBC network programming. Weekdays begin with The Morning Edition. At noon, Blue Sky is heard and in afternoon drive time, Afternoon Edition is broadcast. Saturday and Sunday mornings, Saskatchewan Weekend airs. In Saskatoon, CBK-1-FM 94.1 has carried its own local morning program, Saskatoon Morning, in place of the Regina-based wake up show The Morning Edition, since 2013. It airs from the CBC's Saskatoon bureau in the Affinity Building at 100-128 4th Avenue South in downtown Saskatoon. Saskatoon Morning began streaming online on April 29, and began airing on 94.1 in September after the CBC won Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approval to move the program over-the-air. For the rest of its broadcasting day, CBK-FM-1 carries the same programming as CBK.CBC: \\"CBC's Saskatoon Morning show to start Thursday\\". CBC News, September 23, 2013. Rebroadcasters In 2000, the CBC opened a local FM repeater of CBK in Regina, CBKR-FM 102.5. In 2006, a Saskatoon repeater was added, CBK-1-FM 94.1. Both cities had been plagued with reception problems of the main 540 AM signal. CBK has the following rebroadcasters. Except for its Regina, Saskatoon and Meadow Lake transmitters, all are officially part of the licence of CBKA-FM in La Ronge (see below): =Community-owned rebroadcasters= Though separately licensed, CBKA-FM in La Ronge is a full- time satellite of CBK. Until 2009, that station produced its own noon-hour show and regional news updates, although it aired both The Morning Edition and The Afternoon Edition.\\"Radio operation in La Ronge falls victim to CBC budget cuts\\".

The SRTM was flown on an 11-day mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in February 2000. This NASA image used Landsat data to texture-map the surface created using SRTM Elevation data. The Cape Peninsula and Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, are visible in the foreground. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is an international research effort that obtained digital elevation models on a near-global scale from 56¬∞S to 60¬∞N, to generate the most complete high- resolution digital topographic database of Earth prior to the release of the ASTER GDEM in 2009. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour during the 11-day STS-99 mission in February 2000. The radar system was based on the older Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), previously used on the Shuttle in 1994. To acquire topographic data, the SRTM payload was outfitted with two radar antennas. One antenna was located in the Shuttle's payload bay, the other ‚Äì a critical change from the SIR-C/X-SAR, allowing single-pass interferometry ‚Äì on the end of a 60-meter (200-foot) mast that extended from the payload bay once the Shuttle was in space. The technique employed is known as interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Intermap Technologies was the prime contractor for processing the interferometric synthetic aperture radar data. The elevation models are arranged into tiles, each covering one degree of latitude and one degree of longitude, named according to their south western corners. For example, \\"n45e006\\" stretches from 45¬∞N 6¬∞E to 46¬∞N 7¬∞E and \\"s45w006\\" from 45¬∞S 6¬∞W to 44¬∞S 5¬∞W. The resolution of the raw data is one arcsecond (30 m along the equator) and coverage includes Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. A derived one arcsecond dataset with trees and other non-terrain features removed covering Australia was made available in November 2011; the raw data are restricted for government use. For the rest of the world, only three arcsecond (90 m along the equator) data are available. Each one arcsecond tile has 3,601 rows, each consisting of 3,601 16 bit bigendian cells. The dimensions of the three arcsecond tiles are 1201 x 1201. The original SRTM elevations were calculated relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid and then the EGM96 geoid separation values were added to convert to heights relative to the geoid for all the released products. The elevation models derived from the SRTM data are used in geographic information systems. They can be downloaded freely over the Internet, and their file format (.hgt) is widely supported. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is an international project spearheaded by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA transferred the SRTM payload to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in 2003; the canister, mast, and antenna are now on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.  No-data areas  SRTM void filling with spline interpolation in GRASS GIS. The elevation datasets are affected by mountain and desert no-data areas. These amount to no more than 0.2% of the total area surveyed,Reuter H.I, A. Nelson, A. Jarvis, 2007, An evaluation of void filling interpolation methods for SRTM data, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 21:9, 983‚Äì1008 ‚Äì 'the ‚Äòfinished‚Äô grade version of the data (also referred to as Version 2) still contains data voids (some 836,000 km^2)'; 836,000 is 0.164% of the Earth's 5.1√ó10^8 km^2 surface but can be a problem in areas of very high relief. They affect all summits over 8,000 meters, most summits over 7,000 meters, many Alpine and similar summits and ridges, and many gorges and canyons. There are some SRTM data sources which have filled these data voids, but some of these have used only interpolation from surrounding data, and may therefore be very inaccurate. If the voids are large, or completely cover summit or ridge areas, no interpolation algorithms will give satisfactory results. Other developers, including NASA World Wind and Google Earth, have improved their results by using 1-arc-second for the United States and 3-arc- second for the rest of the world, data in the interpolation process, but, due to the poor resolution of these data, and very poor quality of some of them, they have further improved their earth viewing services by adding data from other sources.  Void-filled SRTM datasets  Sierra Nevada, Spain Example of relief map from SRTM1 (central Nevada) Groups of scientists have worked on algorithms to fill the voids of the original SRTM data. Two datasets offer global coverage void-filled SRTM data at full resolution: the CGIAR-CSI versions and the USGS HydroSHEDS dataset. The CGIAR-CSI version 4 provides the best global coverage full resolution SRTM dataset. The HydroSHEDS dataset was generated for hydrological applications and is suitable for consistent drainage and water flow information. References are provided on the algorithms used and quality assessment. The void-filled SRTM data from Viewfinder Panoramas are high quality at full SRTM resolution. Since November 2012 there is free and global coverage at 3 arc seconds available. In November 2013, LP DAAC released the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Version 3.0 (SRTM Plus) Product collection with all voids eliminated. Voids were filled primarily from ASTER GDEM2, and secondarily from USGS GMTED2010 ‚Äì or USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) for the United States (except Alaska) and northernmost Mexico according to the announcement.  Highest Resolution Global Release  1-arc second global digital elevation model (30 meters) is available from the United States Geological Survey web site. The United States Government announced on September 23, 2014 over a United Nations Climate Summit that the highest possible resolution of global topographic data derived from the SRTM mission will be released to public. Before the end of the same year, a 1-arc second global digital elevation model (30 meters) was released. Most parts of the world have been covered by this dataset ranging from 54¬∞S to 60¬∞N latitude except for the Middle East and North Africa area. Missing coverage of the Middle East was completed in August 2015. Users In early June 2011, there were 750,000 confirmed users of SRTM topography dataset. Users in 221 countries have accessed the site.

Festival of German-Language Literature / Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, 2007 The Festival of German-Language Literature () is a literary event which takes place annually in Klagenfurt, Austria. During this major literary festival which lasts for several days a number of awards are given, the major one being the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, first awarded in 1977 and one of the most important awards for literature in the German language.  History  In the mid seventies, the journalist and writer Humbert Fink and the chairman of the Austrian Radio and TV (ORF) studio in Carinthia at that time, Ernst Willner, decided to establish a literary competition based on an event held by Gruppe 47. They were able to enlist Marcel Reich-Ranicki amongst others onto the original jury. The result was the Festival of German-Language Literature, which has taken place annually since 1977 and is televised live by ORF.  The Ingeborg Bachmann Prize  The main prize of the Festival is given in memory of Ingeborg Bachmann (25 June 1926 ‚Äì 17 October 1973), one of the most distinguished Austrian writers. The prize winner is determined during a three- day reading event in which the invited candidates present their literary contributions, which have to be unpublished, to the nine-member professional jury and the public. Each presentation is about 25 minutes long and the original language of these contributions must be German.See the announcement of the Bachmann Prize at the Uschtrin Service , retrieved on 4 April 2011. A moderator presents and guides the readings and the discussions of the jury and the writers have to convince both the jury and the public of the quality of their contributions. In 2008, the jury was reduced to seven members, the competing writers from eighteen to fourteen. Since 2006, the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize has been endowed with 25,000 EUR.  Other prizes  Several other literature prizes are awarded during the Festival, in total usually three to five awards. Over the years, additional sponsored prizes have been awarded: * Deutschlandfunk Prize (EUR 12,500) * Jury Prize, aka Kelag-Prize (since 2000, EUR 10,000) * 3sat Prize (given by 3sat, EUR 7,500) * Ernst Willner Prize (EUR 7,000) * Audience Prize (since 2002, EUR 5,000) * Editor's special prize  Prize winners  Sharon Dodua Otoo - Winner of the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize for 2016 * 2020 Festival (virtual) *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Helga Schubert: Vom Aufstehen *:* Deutschlandfunk Prize: Lisa Krusche: F√ºr bestimmte Welten k√§mpfen und gegen andere *:* Kelag Prize: Egon Christian Leitner: Immer im Krieg *:* 3sat Prize: Laura Freudenthaler: Der hei√üeste Sommer *:* BKS Prize of the Audience: Lydia Haider: Der gro√üe Gru√ü * 2019 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Birgit Birnbacher: Der Schrank *:* Deutschlandfunk Prize: Leander Fischer: Nymphenverzeichnis Muster Nummer eins Goldkopf *:* Kelag Prize: Julia Jost: Unweit vom Schakaltal *:* 3sat Prize: Yannic Han Biao Federer: Kenn ich nicht *:* BKS Prize of the Audience: Ronya Othmann: Vierundsiebzig * 2018 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Tanja Maljartschuk: Fr√∂sche im Meer *:* Deutschlandfunk Prize: Bov Bjerg: SERPENTINEN *:* Kelag Prize: √ñzlem √ñzg√ºl D√ºndar: und ich brenne *:* 3sat Prize: Anna Stern: Warten auf Ava *:* BKS Prize of the Audience: Raphaela Edelbauer: Das Loch *2017 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Ferdinand Schmalz: mein lieblingstier hei√üt winter *:* Deutschlandfunk Prize: John Wray: Madrigal *:* Kelag Prize: Eckhart Nickel: Hysteria *:* 3sat Prize: Gianna Molinari: Loses Mappe *:* BKS Prize of the Audience: Karin Peschka: Wiener Kindl * 2016 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Sharon Dodua Otoo, Herr Gr√∂ttrup setzt sich hin *:* Kelag Prize: , Los Alamos ist winzig *:* 3sat Prize: , WALTER NOWAK BLEIBT LIEGEN *:* BKS Prize of the Audience: Stefanie Sargnagel, Penne vom Kika * 2015 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Nora Gomringer, Recherche *:* Kelag Prize: , Das Bein *:* 3sat Prize: , Das prim√§re Gef√ºhl der Schuldlosigkeit *:* BKS Prize of the Audience: , Das Bein * 2014 FestivalRubinowitz gewinnt Bachmannpreis kaernten.orf.at, 6 July 2014 *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: , Wir waren niemals hier *:* Kelag Prize: , Simeliberg *:* 3sat Prize: , Vor der Zunahme der Zeichen *:* Ernst Willner Prize: , DOWN DOWN DOWN To The Queen Of Chinatown *:* Prize of the Audience: , Ujjayi * 2013 FestivalPetrowskaja gewinnt Bachmannpreis kaernten.orf.at, 7 July 2013 *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Katja Petrowskaja, Vielleicht Esther *:* Kelag Prize: Verena G√ºntner, Es bringen *:* 3sat Prize: Benjamin Maack, ‚ÄûWie man einen K√§fer richtig f√§ngt‚Äú by Joachim Kaltenbach *:* Ernst Willner Prize: Heinz Helle, Wir sind sch√∂n *:* Prize of the Audience: Nadine Kegele, Scherben schlucken * 2012 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Olga Martynowa for Ich werde sagen: ‚ÄöHi!‚Äò *:* Kelag Prize: Matthias Nawrat for Unternehmer *:* 3sat Prize: Lisa Kr√§nzler for Willste abhauen *:* Ernst Willner Prize: Inger-Maria Mahlke *:* Prize of the Audience: Cornelia Travnicek for Junge Hunde * 2011 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Maja Haderlap for Im Kessel *:* Kelag Prize: Steffen Popp for Spur einer Dorfgeschichte *:* 3sat Prize: Nina Bu√ümann for Gro√üe Ferien *:* Ernst Willner Prize: Leif Randt for Schimmernder Dunst √ºber CobyCounty *:* Prize of the Audience: Thomas Klupp for 9to5 Hardcore * 2010 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Peter Wawerzinek for Rabenliebe *:* Kelag Prize: Dorothee Elmiger for Einladung an die Waghalsigen *:* 3sat Prize: Judith Zander for Dinge, die wir heute sagten *:* Ernst Willner Prize: Aleks Scholz for Google Earth *:* Prize of the Audience: Peter Wawerzinek for Rabenliebe * 2009 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Jens Petersen for Bis dass der Tod *:* Kelag Prize: Ralf B√∂nt for Der Fotoeffekt *:* 3sat Prize: Gregor Sander for Winterfisch *:* Ernst Willner Prize: Katharina Born for Fifty Fifty *:* Prize of the Audience: Karsten Krampitz for Heimgehen * 2008 Festival *:* Ingeborg Bachmann Prize: Tilman Rammstedt for Der Kaiser von China] *:* Telekom Austria Prize: Markus Orths: Das Zimmerm√§dchen *:* 3sat Prize: Patrick Findeis for Kein sch√∂ner Land *:* Ernst Willner Prize: Clemens J.

The player can assume the role of one of five characters with different abilities, a member of one of two races‚Äîthe Kindar or the Erdling‚Äîand attempt to settle the existing differences between the two groups. History The game was based on a series of books by Zilpha Keatley Snyder. Explaining how the game came about, she wrote: :\\"Like so many of my books, the trilogy's deepest root goes back to my early childhood when I played a game that involved crossing a grove of oak trees by climbing from tree to tree, because something incredibly dangerous lived \\"below the root.\\" Years later when I was writing The Changeling I recalled the game, and in the course of embellishing it for that story, became intrigued with the idea of returning to the world of Green-sky for a longer stay. The return trip took three years and produced three more books. Initially published in 1975, 1976, and 1977, the trilogy was later reincarnated as a computer game (published by Spinnaker Software of Cambridge, MA). :The computer game transpired when I was contacted by a young computer programmer named Dale Disharoon. After Dale introduced me to the world of computer games, I wrote and charted, Dale programmed, and a young artist named Bill Groetzinger made marvelous graphics for a game that takes off from where the third book of the trilogy ends.\\" Zilpha Keatley Snyder: Autobiography. The original world of Green-sky first appeared in Snyder's novel The Changeling, where it was a fantasy world conceived by two schoolgirls. As such, it featured princes and princesses, wicked queens and familiar fairytale situations. However, many of the details appeared in the later novels. Green- sky as the girls imagined it is a low-gravity planet whose residents live in \\"softly rocking\\" houses built in the branches of enormous trees and \\"glide like blowing leaves\\" between the branches; \\"nothing was ever killed under the green sky\\" and the people live on a wide variety of fruits and nuts; they have brightly colored monkeys and songbirds for pets. Their skin is pale green, and their hair is darker green, often blossoming naturally into flowers. Below the ground live creatures of unspeakable evil, which must not be allowed to penetrate into the upper world.Snyder, Zilpha Keatley, The Changeling. Athenaeum, 1970. Premise The Kindar of Green-sky were a utopian and strictly pacifistic society, ruled by leaders known as the Ol-zhaan, whom the average Kindar believed to be godlike. \\"Unjoyful\\" emotions like anger and sorrow were banned, and kept under strict control by a system of meditation, chant and ritual, accompanied by the use of narcotic berries (which some people, including little children, overuse). The people were vegetarians, although they did eat eggs, and kept brightly colored monkeys, songbirds and occasionally small tree bears as pets. The books establish them as descendants of European Caucasians, orphans who fled Earth due to war. Supporting this, many of the \\"alien\\" terms, such as \\"sima\\" for tree-monkey, \\"grund\\" for tree, and D'ol being a corrupted form of \\"Doctor,\\" are clearly rooted in Latin, German, or French. Infants were born with paranormal powers, which should be retained into adulthood, but were disappearing earlier with each successive generation. The people lived in fear of the forest floor and the pash-shan, legendary monsters said to stalk below the roots of their magnificent tree- cities. In the books, a novice Ol-zhaan named Raamo and his friend Neric (one of the game's playable characters) set out to discover if the monsters truly exist. What they found were the Erdlings, a dark-skinned race made up of exiled Kindar dissidents and their descendants. Where the Kindar live their whole lives in the shade, the Erdlings seek places where the sun penetrates the caverns. They have been living in the caverns and subsisting on plants, mushrooms and the occasional unwary rabbit (lapan) or ground bird, plus fallen fruits from the Kindar orchards. They are superb craftsmen, metalworkers and jewelers; they have fire, which is unknown in Green-sky, and transport people and supplies by railway, using steam propulsion. They have no taboos against anger, sadness or other \\"unjoyful\\" emotions, and (possibly as a result) appear to have retained much more of their psychic powers than have the Kindar. Their discovery shakes the very foundation of Green-sky's social order. The Erdlings are released from their exile and the Ol-zhaan disbanded, but reconciling the two societies takes a long time. An unnamed society of disgruntled Ol-zhaan (called Salite in the game) and the Nekom, vengeance-seeking Erdlings, began patrolling the branch-paths and causing unrest. Furthermore, Raamo himself apparently perished, silencing a voice for tolerance and unity. In the game's manual, you are told that the wise old woman (and former Ol-zhaan high priestess) D'ol Falla has a vision, in which she heard these words: \\"The Spirit fades, in Darkness lying. A quest proclaim - the Light is dying.\\" Your character (one of five from the series) then begins the game looking for clues to the meaning of D'ol Falla's vision in hopes of restoring peace to both nations. Gameplay This game was highly ambitious and had many subtle and clever details woven into its universe. First of all were the social norms of Green-Sky. Theft and violence were alien concepts to most of the books' characters. Therefore, one could not (as is common with adventure games) simply walk into a room and pocket an unattended object. One had to find the owner of the object and ask permission, buy the object with money (called tokens) in a shop, or locate the object in a public area. In the books, the Kindar economy was a moneyless quasi-communism; it was the Erdlings who used tokens and were used to being able to buy whatever they could afford.Snyder, Zilpha Keatley, Until the Celebration (Athenaeum, 1977), p. 73. Particularly interesting was the extremely low level of violence in the game. The player could be hurt only by falling, coming into contact with snakes or tree spiders (invented for the game), or walking into walls. These incidents merely resulted in a jarring \\"bump\\" sound effect and an animation of the character crouching and rubbing their head, as if recovering from a nasty knock, rather than any gruesome or graphic injury. The worst that could happen would be your shuba tearing, so that you could no longer glide until you obtained a new one. Even the occasional adversary did not hurt one's character grievously, although one did slowly lose health points and game time, and might find oneself sent back to one's nid-place (house) with an ominous notice that \\"you were found unconscious.\\" Alternately, your character could be kidnapped and held prisoner by the racist factions of the Salite or Nekom in one of the two \\"prison houses\\" in the game. A player with no other way to escape these prisons (or who found themselves otherwise trapped) could \\"renew\\", which was essentially a process of slipping briefly into a sort of recuperative coma, which resulted, as with the loss of all health points, in a loss of game time and the character returning to their nid-place (again, assuring that the character could never actually die during the game). In the Nekom \\"prison house,\\" you could find a machete (called a \\"wand of Befal\\" after Axon Befal, the Erdling faction's leaderSnyder, Zilpha Keatley, Until the Celebration (Athenaeum, 1977), p. 92.), but its primary use was to cut thick vegetation. If you killed people with this blade, there were serious, permanent penalties to your abilities. Taking lives would essentially make the game unwinnable, which is consistent with the themes expressed in the original story. It was among the first games that offered a choice of multiple protagonists, as well as a choice of gender, age, race, and beginning level of psychic powers (referred to as \\"Spirit-skills\\"). Furthermore, people treated the characters differently based on your choice of avatar. A child character could be invited to play. Erdling characters could be given a chilly reception at some Kindar houses and vice versa. Consistent with the books, these people were portrayed as being opposed to any alliances between the two cultures, and thus had to be avoided whenever possible. Pensing to read thoughts and emotions when encountering a stranger provided clues to their attitudes and distinguished friend from foe. While the game's technology limited the extent of these features, they were certainly present. Another interesting detail is that the vegetarian Kindar characters did not get much nutrition out of eating meat, and temporarily lost psychic abilities. Likewise, the narcotic Wissenberries were somewhat more health-damaging to Erdling characters. In the books, Kindar ‚Äî even children ‚Äî often used the berries in rituals and ceremony, as well as recreationally, and for relief of physical and emotional pain.Snyder, Zilpha Keatley, Below the Root (Athenaeum, 1975), p. 34. Most of the gameplay focused on the challenges of getting the character to move around the game world. Various objects in the game were used for this. Of primary importance was the shuba, a flying-squirrel-like garment which allows the character to glide diagonally instead of falling, and also prevented the character from being hurt by falls. Along the way, one learns a variety of \\"Spirit skills\\" or psychic abilities of progressive difficulty. The Spirit-skills, which included telepathy (called \\"pensing\\"), telekinesis (called \\"kiniporting\\") and the ability to make tree branches grow to create temporary bridges across impassible gaps (\\"grunspreking\\") are the key to making progress in the game world and achieving the ultimate goal. Communicating with animals as well as people through telepathy is vital to enhancing the character's Spirit-skills. The graphics were exquisitely colored, highly advanced for the time. Users have described the deeply evocative and compelling qualities of the images as being one of the main reasons they kept playing.\\"Believe it or not, at the time the graphics on this game were incredible.\\" In Zeebarf's game review blog , page found 2010-07-03. Snyder's husband Larry wrote a number of bell-like musical phrases very much in the style of the choral chant important to both cultures as described in the books. As in today's games, these pieces are heard when an important discovery is made or the player gains important skills or advances. The game is a direct sequel to the books, and is meant by the author to be taken as canon. It originated in Snyder's realization that one of her final plot elements had been a huge mistake. She was being flooded with mail from adults and children, but could not see any way to change the ending now that the book was on the market. In addition, she had believed the event she described to be necessary to the ultimate resolution of the plot. Introduced to the concept of computer games, Snyder saw a way to redeem the situation while keeping and even advancing the original plot. The object of the game is to solve the mystery of what really happened.

A canting keel is a form of sailing ballast, suspended from a rigid canting strut beneath the boat, which can be swung to windward of a boat under sail, in order to counteract the heeling force of the sail. The canting keel must be able to pivot to either port or starboard, depending on the current tack. Purpose and history The traditional yacht keel performs four functions: * the development of lateral water force to resist lateral aerodynamic force from sails and superstructure, * the physical housing of ballast load as low as possible, * roll-damping to resist energy inputs from waves and disturbed water, and * a contribution to directional stability. The traditional fin keel, pointing straight down from the boat, provides no righting moment when the boat is level. The heeling force of the wind on the sails is therefore not counteracted until the boat has heeled over by a certain amount, moving the fixed keel to windward of the centerline. The purpose of the canting keel is to allow the boat to sail closer to level which generates maximum speed, by swinging the keel to windward and developing an adequate righting moment to keep the boat's angle of heel closer to level. With the canting keel handling the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering can be managed separately with a foil (or pair of foils, either on each side or fore and aft), such as daggerboards. This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats, with about half the weight usually required for ballast. The first patent for a canting keel device was granted by Douglas Beardy on May 8, 1900.https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid;=00648911&IDKey;=D43DA0B64DAA&HomeUrl;=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fpatimg.htm The first yacht to have an canting keel was the \\"Fiery Cross\\" designed by Jim Young (New Zealand) in 1959. In this canting keel device, the lever was mounted inside the fin at an angle and at the top it was connected to a vertical shaft. When the shaft was twisted around its axis, a curved lever pressed against the inner walls of the fin and tilted it.https://www.sailnet.com/forums/971567-post3362.html A version of the technology was invented and patented by CBF Technology in the 1990s. The canting keel's first use was in an offshore race was the 1991 Mini Transat on number 29 Fouesnant la Foret and then in the Vendee Globe of 1996-7 which Pete Goss completed in a 50 ft, Adrian Thompson-designed yacht named Aqua Quorum. Development of the yacht and the events of the Race are described in detail in Pete's subsequent book Close to the Wind. Subsequent use in major competition was in September 2004, when five boats using the canting keel in the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup placed ahead of the previously unbeaten world champion Alfa Romeo. Alfa Romeo II, designed by Reichel/Pugh features a canting keel and fore-and-aft twin foils (CBTF). A variation of the canting keel is the 3d keel invented by Fran√ßois Lucas in 1998, which allows movement in three directions (side to side, forward and aft, and side to side). Current use Originally used in large maxi yachts such as the maxZ86, canting keels are now beginning to appear in smaller boats such as the Open 60, and the VO70 and Volvo Ocean 65http://www.seahorsemagazine.com/current-issue/134-leading-edge (Volvo Ocean 65) ocean racing classes, and the even smaller Schock 40 and Classe Mini. The Schock 40 owned by Tom Schock famously lost its keel and capsized, illustrating the fundamental problem with complicated keel design: without a keel, most boats cannot float upright. The Volvo Open 70 class boats in the 2006 around-the-world Volvo Ocean Race are perhaps the most well known boats to use canting keels for ballast. While previous years' boats showed a few percent improvement in speed each race (the race is held every three years) the VO70 class are showing a 30% improvement in speed. The 6.5 ton ballast bulb, hanging over 16 feet (5 meters) below the water and capable of canting up to 40 degrees, produces a tremendous amount of righting moment (over 130,000 ft¬∑lbf, or 176,000 N¬∑m with the hull level), allowing the boat to reach speeds of over 30 knots. Disadvantages The current canting keel technology is far from perfect. At least three of the seven boats in the 2006 Volvo Ocean Race, one of the first major long term races allowing canting keels, had problems with the keels. One area in particular, the plates sealing the opening through which the keel passes, are prone to leaks. Unlike a centerboard or daggerboard trunk, the opening for a canting keel must allow significant lateral motion, which requires sliding seals. The boat movistar had problems on Leg 4 of the Volvo Ocean Race, 200 miles off Cape Horn, during the night on 2 March 2006. It sprung a significant leak when the sliding plates that covered the keel opening fell off in the middle of the night. This was a problem that had occurred earlier. movistar's aft keel pivot broke loose and began flooding the boat. They made repairs in Ushuaia on the Beagle Channel. Later on, in Leg 7 the same problem occurred in the north Atlantic. This time the decision was made to abandon ship, and the crew transferred to ABN AMRO TWO. movistar continued to broadcast its position for several days, but an aerial search failed to find the vessel, and it was lost. In the 2006/2007 Velux 5 Oceans Race (a single-handed, round the world race), the Open 60 yacht Hugo Boss, skippered by Alex Thomson, had to be abandoned in the Southern Ocean due to the snapping of the hydraulic rams that controlled the keel, which caused the catastrophic failure of the keel. When this failure caused the yacht to nearly capsize, the boat was abandoned; Thomson was rescued by fellow competitor Mike Golding. On 25 November 2006, the boat's Sat C transponder stopped transmitting. The abandoned hull was found washed up on the shores of Patagonia 9 years later.http://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/elaine-bunting/wreck-found-after- drifting-for-9-years-and-10000-miles-in-the-southern-ocean-is-alex-thomsons- hugo-boss-70470 In December 2016, Wild Oats XI has retired from the 72nd Sydney to Hobart yacht race, citing a broken hydraulic ram. Race spokesman Bruce Montgomery said Wild Oats XI was unable to move its keel after a hydraulic ram broke. \\"It's the gear that operates its canting keel, which is the keel that swings under the boat,\\" he said.http://ab.co/2hnZQTd, Top Stories: 'Tragedy' as Wild Oats XI retires from Sydney to Hobart America's Cup There were rumors that the 2007 International America's Cup Class yacht Alinghi might have had a canting keel. This would have given Alinghi an advantage over its challenger for the 2007 America's Cup, unless the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, also had a swinging keel. The America's Cup Class Committee, chaired by Ken McAlpine, issued a ruling on 8 May 2007 which stated that canting keels and other movable appendages were specifically prohibited. Alternative designs canting keel with chain and tilt the fin 90 degrees or more In recent years, canting keel devices have been proposed in which the drive is not a lever, as it was before, but something else. One of these devices is a canting keel with a chain drive, which is able to tilt the fin 90 degrees or more. The author of this invention is Boris Kuchukov.https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100001533262957 The fin and ballast keel must be in the air when a yacht equipped with such a device is moving. In theory, this should increase the speed of the yacht.

Metaphors The concept is associated with a set of metaphors attempting to convey the speed and intensity of falling in love by describing it as a physical process of falling or being struck. Alternately, falling in love is often described with reference to Cupid's arrow. Other sources, such as Tristram Shandy, describe the process by referring to it as the act of being shot with a gun: 'I am in love with Mrs Wadman, quoth my uncle Toby - She has left a ball here - added my uncle Toby - pointing to his breast'.Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy (Penguin 1976) p. 554 Psychoanalysis The twentieth-century saw the concept of love-sickness reconceptualised by psychoanalysis. As early as 1915, Freud asked rhetorically, \\"Isn't what we mean by 'falling in love' a kind of sickness and craziness, an illusion, a blindness to what the loved person is really like?\\"Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (1988) p. 9 Half a century later, in 1971, Hans Loewald took up the theme, comparing being in analysis 'to the passions and conflicts stirred up anew in the state of being in love which, from the point of view of the ordinary order and emotional tenor and discipline of life, feels like an illness, with all its deliciousness and pain'.Quoted in Malcolm, p. 127 Symptoms A 2005 article by Frank Tallis suggested that being utterly romantically lovestruck should be taken more seriously by professionals. \\"For love-struck victims, the world appears altered. Replacing the flatness of ordinary experience is a fullness\\".Kathryn Allen Rabuzzi, Mother with Child (1994) p. 117 According to Tallis, some of the symptom clusters shared with being lovestruck include: *Euphoria, that is, abnormally elevated mood, inflated self-esteem, extravagant gift giving *Tearfulness *Loss of concentration and difficulty sleeping *Lack of appetite *Stress - high blood pressure, pain in chest and heart, acute insomnia; sometimes brought on by a \\"crush\\" *Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder - Preoccupation and hoarding valueless but superstitiously resonant items *psychologically created physical symptoms, such as upset stomach, change in appetite, insomnia, dizziness, and confusion. More substantively, the estimated serotonin levels of people falling in love were observed to drop to levels found in patients with OCD. Brain scan investigations of individuals who professed to be \\"truly, madly, deeply\\" in love showed activity in several structures in common with the neuroanatomy of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD), for example the anterior cingulate cortex and caudate nucleus. Criticism Some who would \\"disagree with Frank Tallis's fundamental thesis that love should be seen as a mental illness...concur that at the extreme and under certain circumstances love sickness can drive a person to despair\\".M.

It was developed by DreamForge Intertainment and published by ASC Games in 1998. It was a commercial success, with sales around 300,000 units. In 2015, it was ported to iOS and Android devices. Plot After a car accident knocks him unconscious, a man awakens from a coma, his face fully bandaged, to find that he has been admitted to a derelict sanitarium and that he cannot remember who he is or where he came from, or how he came to be there, though his fellow inmates seem to know him simply as \\"Max.\\" As he delves deeper into the asylum's corridors in search of answers, Max finds himself transported to various obscure and otherworldly locations: a small town inhabited only by malformed children and overseen by a malevolent alien entity known only as \\"Mother,\\" a demented circus surrounded by an endless ocean and terrorized by a squid-like individual, an alien hive overrun by cyborg insects, and an Aztec village devastated by the return of the god Quetzalcoatl. Between each imaginary episode, Max returns to the asylum grounds, blending real and unreal, each time closer to regaining his memory and unraveling the truth surrounding the mysterious Dr. Morgan, head of the asylum. He remembers the death of his younger sister Sarah years ago and the real reason behind his institutionalization. Gameplay The game uses a bird's-eye view perspective and a non-tiled 2D navigational system. Each world and setting carries a distinct atmosphere that presents either the real world, the imaginary world, or a mix of both of the main protagonist. In many cases, it is unclear to the player if the world the character is currently in is real or a product of Max's own imagination. This indistinction underlines much of the horror portrayed in the game. The game is separated into different levels or \\"chapters\\" with each having a different style and atmosphere. The player must find clues, solve puzzles and interact with other characters to reach a final challenge where the player must reach the end of a path while avoiding obstacles. If the player fails to do so (by, for instance, getting killed) then the player is transported back to the beginning of the path without losing progress, thus a Game Over in this game is non-existent. When the player reaches the end of the path, a cinematic is played and the game proceeds to the next chapter. Reception Sanitarium was commercially successful. According to Mike Nicholson of DreamForge, the game sold roughly 300,000 copies. Chris Kellner of DTP Entertainment, which handled Sanitariums German localization, reported its lifetime sales between 10,000 and 50,000 copies in the region. According to PC Accelerator, Sanitarium was a \\"critical success\\" that helped to raise DreamForge Intertainment's profile as a company. =Awards= Sanitarium won Computer Gaming Worlds 1998 \\"Best Adventure\\" award, tied with Grim Fandango. The editors wrote that the game \\"came from out of nowhere to provide the creepiest, most compelling, and best-told story of the year, bar none\\". Computer Games Strategy Plus, PC Gamer US, GameSpot, IGN and the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) all nominated Sanitarium as the best adventure game of 1998, but it lost these awards to Grim Fandango. PC Gamer USs editors remarked that Sanitarium is \\"full of beautiful graphics, interesting characters, and well-designed puzzles, and is a must-play for any true adventurer.\\" The game was also a nominee for GameSpot's \\"Best Story\\" and the AIAS's \\"Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development\\" awards, which went to StarCraft and Pok√©mon Red and Blue, respectively. Legacy In 2013, a programmer from the Sanitarium development team announced a project on Kickstarter called Shades of Sanity that was touted as the spiritual successor to Sanitarium. The project failed to attain funding. In 2015, a Kickstarter funded adventure game called Stasis was released by a South African independent studio The Brotherhood. It has been compared to Sanitarium. On October 29, 2015, DotEmu released an iOS port of Sanitarium with touchscreen controls, dynamic hint system, achievements and automatic save system. In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Sanitarium the 36th-best adventure game ever released.

It is located in Hawalli, Kuwait. History In 1963, a group of American parents began the process of forming a new international school in Kuwait. This new school's first term began in September, 1964, in the Dasman Area of Sharq, Kuwait, and was known as the International School of Kuwait. In 1969, the ASK Campus separated into two campuses, with one in Salwa and one in Surra. The Salwa campus contained the Elementary school, while the Surra campus contained both the Middle and High Schools. The school received its initial US accreditation from the Middle States Association in 1971, and has been receiving it continuously since then. The school was closed for the 1990 to 1991 school term, due to the events of the invasion of Kuwait. The school reopened in the fall of 1991. Over the summer of 1994, both ASK campuses, the Surra and Salwa campuses, moved again to a new campus located in the Hawalli area. This reunited the elementary, middle, and high school students once again in one campus for the start of the 1994 to 1995 school term. The school has been at this location ever since. Present dayAdministration= Mr. Michael Murphy is the current superintendent of the school. The principals of each of the schools are Ms. Monique Livsey (high school), Mrs. Kristi Fowler (middle school), and Dr. Steve Caley (elementary school). =Faculty= The school currently has 183 full-time faculty members, including 88 American nationals, 35 Canadian citizens, and 60 teachers representing 14 other nationalities. =Student body= The School currently (as of September, 2018) has approximately 2,101 students total. Approximately 20% of the students are US citizens, 54% are locals, and the remaining 26% represent 65 other nationalities. Pre-K and elementary have 1012 students, the middle school has 471 students, and the high school has 618 students; there are 144 seniors, 151 juniors, 160 sophomores, and 163 freshmen. =Campus and facilities= The school possesses one of the largest campuses in Kuwait. The campus now houses 145 classrooms, which include eight computer labs, four music rooms, four art rooms, ten science labs, two large library/media centers, two gymnasiums, a fitness center and weight room, an indoor 25-meter pool, a large multi-purpose auditorium, and three large outdoor play areas. Curriculum The curriculum is similar to that of US general academic and college preparatory schools. The school‚Äôs testing programs include the SAT, PSAT, Plan, Explore, ACT and the MAPS. The language of instruction is English. French and Spanish are taught as foreign languages. Religious instruction is required for Muslims, as is Arabic for all students (students who hold passports from Arab countries take Arabic language courses through graduation, while holders of passports from non-Arab countries take Arabic-As-a-Second- Language courses until grade 11). The elementary program, in which teachers are organized into grade-level teams, features specialists in science, art, computer studies, music, drama, physical education, Arabic, and Islamic Studies. The middle school, which includes sixth through eighth grades, utilizes interdisciplinary teams and a curriculum based on a block schedule. The high school, which currently offers seventeen AP courses, is constantly re-evaluating its programs to better serve the needs and interests of students. The American School of Kuwait is also one of the first schools worldwide to offer the AP Capstone Diploma program. Athletics and extracurricular activities ASK offers clubs and organizations with activities from service projects to leadership opportunities and competitions. All students are encouraged to join and take active part in the club or activity of their choice and interest. Previously a member of both the Eastern Mediterranean Activities Conference (EMAC) and the Kuwait Foreign Schools Activities Conference (KFSAC), ASK is a charter member of the Near East Schools Activities Conference (NESAC), and is also a member of the Kuwait Schools Activities Association (KSAA), and the South Asian Inter-Scholastic Association (SAISA).http://www.ask.edu.kw The athletic programs offered at ASK in the fall include Soccer, Swimming, and Volleyball.

It was founded by Jumpsteady, Insane Clown Posse (Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler), and their label in 2000. Described by Joseph Bruce as a \\"Juggalo Woodstock\\" (Juggalo being a nickname for fans of the Insane Clown Posse), the Gathering of the Juggalos spans five days and includes concerts, wrestling, games, contests, autograph sessions, karaoke, and seminars with artists. Over its first eleven events (2000‚Äì2010), the festival drew a total attendance upward of 100,000 fans. HistoryEarly years (2000‚Äì2002)= The Gathering of the Juggalos was created in 1999 when Rob Bruce organized an event for all Juggalos, a concept long talked about by Insane Clown Posse. The first Gathering took place in Detroit, Michigan at the Novi Expo Center and lasted for two days, with over 7,000 fans in attendance. The festival featured concert performances and wrestling hosted by Juggalo Championship Wrestling. While performing on the final night, Insane Clown Posse asked the Juggalos to join them onstage, and about 300 fans rushed onto the stage. After performing for almost 30 more minutes, the concert was abruptly stopped by the venue's management. Vanilla Ice has performed at most of the Gathering of the Juggalos events. The second Gathering of the Juggalos was held in Toledo, Ohio at the Seagate Center for three days, with approximately 6,600 in attendance. Outside artists included Suicide Machines, Marz, Three 6 Mafia, Vanilla Ice, and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Juggalo Championship wrestling hosted several matches, with the main event pitting Sabu against Vampiro for the JCW Heavyweight Championship. Like the previous year, hundreds of fans charged the main stage during Insane Clown Posse's performance. However, this time the group was forced to flee the stage before it collapsed. The festival was ended early, before the duo could reveal their Sixth Joker's Card. The next day, local newspapers reported the rush as a \\"riot\\". The third annual Gathering of the Juggalos was held in the Civic Center in Peoria, Illinois for four days, with over 8,000 in attendance. Esham, Ghoultown, Mack 10, Primer 55, and Bubba Sparxxx were among the guest performers. Bubba Sparxxx was booed offstage and has since left a mark on future Gatherings, as acts sharing similar fates have been said to receive the \\"Bubba Sparxxx award.\\" Esham announced at the event that he had signed with Psychopathic Records. The Sixth Joker's Card was unveiled in two separate seminars, The Wraith: Shangri-La and Hell's Pit, given by Violent J. The second seminar, detailing Insane Clown Posse's entire rise to fame, was captured on video and released with The Wraith: Shangri-La on DVD. A riot occurred after police tried to stop female attendees from showing their breasts. The police released tear gas and pepper balls into the surrounding crowd, causing mass confusion. Psychopathic Record employees Rob Bruce and Alex Abbiss negotiated with police, and the festival continued after airing out for 30 minutes. =Expansion and development (2003‚Äì2006)= In 2003, the Juggalo Gathering was held outdoors for the first time. The event took place at Nelson Ledges Quarry Park, known as \\"the Crystal Forest\\", near Garrettsville, Ohio in Nelson Township, and lasted five days. It was also the first time the festival went on for 24 hours every day. Guest performers included Bushwick Bill, Dope, and Killah Priest. In addition to the wrestling matches, Mad Man Pondo hosted Mad Man Pondo's Wrestling School. Though multiple police were called to watch over the event by Garrettsville residents, the Gathering went off without any problems. Tech N9ne has become a staple performer of the festival since 2004. The fifth annual Gathering of the Juggalos returned to Garrettsville the following year, with over 5,000 in attendance. Ol' Dirty Bastard, Kurupt, Tech N9ne, and Wolfpac were among those who performed. Kurupt got booed off the stage by the attendees, and retaliated by throwing a microphone into the audience. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony also re- united for the first time in several months by making a surprise performance on opening night. Juggalo Championship Wrestling hosted matches every day, and featured several established wrestlers. The Gathering of the Juggalos returned to Garrettsville for a third time in 2005. Guest performers included 2 Live Crew, Powerman 5000, Manntis, and Mini Kiss. Charlie Murphy was also brought in as one of the stand-up comedians. The Gathering hosted the final round of the Underground Psychos contest, in which the winner, Axe Murder Boyz, was signed to Psychopathic Records. Juggalo Championship Wrestling held the event \\"JCW vs. TNA\\" which pitted JCW wrestlers against TNA wrestlers. Quarry Park's owner, Evan Kelley, kicked the festival off his grounds later that year. He stated, \\"Psychopathic Records broke some of the rules set down for the 2005 event, including blasting music all night long.\\" He also explained that, \\"Drugs, alcohol, nudity, profanity and trash also became serious problems.\\" The seventh annual Gathering of the Juggalos was set to take place in Brooklyn, Michigan, however, the board of Woodstock Township, Michigan denied the label the permits needed to hold the event. On April 18, Psychopathic Records announced that the Gathering would be held in Pataskala, Ohio at Frontier Ranch. The festival featured over 100 bands. Those playing at the main and second stages included Drowning Pool, Digital Underground, Rehab, Too $hort, Intricate Unit, Bobaflex, and Vile. =Cave-In-Rock (2007‚Äì2013)= Ice Cube was the opener for the tenth Gathering of the Juggalos. Cave-In-Rock, Illinois hosted the eighth Gathering of the Juggalos at Hogrock Campgrounds, with over 8,000 fans attending the four-day event. Like the previous year, over 100 bands were featured. Performances on the main and second stages included Ying Yang Twins, Necro, Haystak, Zug Izland, Prozak, Mushroomhead, and Insane Poetry. Comedians included Joey Gay. Bloodymania, the culmination of Juggalo Championship Wrestling's web show, SlamTV!, debuted at the event. Anybody Killa was also announced to have signed back with Psychopathic Records. Charlie Sheen hosted Saturday night's main stage at the 2011 event. Cave-In-Rock, Illinois also hosted the ninth Gathering of the Juggalos, which included guest performances by Afroman, Andrew W.K., Ice-T, and Bizarre. Both Bloodymania II and the debut of Oddball Wrestling were presented by Juggalo Championship Wrestling. The Gathering was filmed by Psychopathic Video for the documentary A Family Underground, which was released on May 12, 2009. The tenth Gathering of the Juggalos had the largest attendance in Gathering history with over 20,000 people. Over 120 musical artists performed at the event, including Ice Cube, Gwar, Coolio, and Scarface. During their set, Insane Clown Posse debuted the songs \\"Juggalo Island\\" and \\"Bang! Pow! Boom!\\" from their then-upcoming album Bang! Pow! Boom! Juggalo Championship Wrestling hosted Bloodymania III, Oddball Wrestling, and Flashlight Wrestling. Stand-up comedians included Jimmie Walker and Pauly Shore. The trailer for Big Money Rustlas also premiered during the event, where it was screened twice. In honor of the Western comedy film Big Money Rustlas being released at the event, the eleventh Gathering of the Juggalos featured a \\"Best in the West\\" West Coast hip hop theme. Guest performances include Naughty by Nature, Spice 1, Method Man & Redman, Above the Law, and Warren G. A \\"Ladies' Night\\", hosted by Sugar Slam, featured performances by Kisa, Lil V, Ill E. Gal, and Tila Tequila. Shaggy 2 Dope hosted \\"Shaggy's Old School Super Jam\\", featuring DJing by 2 Dope and performances by Tone L≈çc and Rob Base. Comedy was provided by Tom Green, Gallagher, and Ron Jeremy. Five wrestling shows were booked for the event; Oddball Wrestling, Bloodymania IV, two Flashlight Wrestling events, and an event featuring the cast of Half Pint Brawlers. The twelfth event debuted the use of a celebrity host for each night's main stage with Dustin Diamond, Jumpsteady, Charlie Sheen, and Flavor Flav. Guest acts included artists Busta Rhymes, Mystikal, Juvenile, Lil Jon, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Saliva, Ice Cube, Xzibit, and Paris. All of the main stage performances, as well as the wrestling events Bloodymania 5 and Legends & Icons, were broadcast live on internet pay-per-view. It was also announced that Vanilla Ice had signed with Psychopathic Records. The thirteenth annual gathering took place from August 8 through 12, 2012 at Cave-In-Rock and featured Insane Clown Posse, Twiztid, Psychopathic Rydas, Dark Lotus, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, ABK, comedian Ralphie May, DJ Clay, Mike E. Clark, and Cold 187 AKA Big Hutch. Some other guest artists and groups included Tech N9ne, The Pharcyde, Soulfly, Fear Factory, Cheech & Chong, Danny Brown, Slaine, ¬°Mayday! & the Geto Boys. A volume of photographs by Daniel Cronin from the event has been published, showing predominantly the people attending the event, not the performers.The Gathering of the Juggalos Photographs by Daniel Cronin, with a foreword by Camille Dodero. Munich: Prestel, 2013(?). . The fourteenth annual gathering took place from August 7 through 11, 2013 at Cave-In-Rock. This was the final time the event was held at Cave-In-Rock. = Legend Valley Ohio, Oklahoma City, Springville and Crystal Forest (2014‚Äìpresent) = In February 2014, it was announced that the Gathering would be moving from its home at Cave-in-Rock to a family Campground in Kaiser, Missouri. However, several local citizens vigorously protested the Gathering being held in this location and the event had to be moved once more. It was reported by Insane Clown Posse themselves that locals had started a petition to keep the Gathering out of their area and flooded the owners of the campground with angry phone calls. Finally, a self- professed Juggalo referred to as Steve (who had previously been to the Gathering himself) contacted Psychopathic Records and offered the 120-acre Legend Valley as a place to host the event. Legend Valley (located in Thornville, Ohio) was officially chosen as the Gathering's venue for 2014. In a statement by Psychopathic Records in the February 28, 2014 edition of the Hatchet Herald, it was said that \\"Mere hours after the news begin spreading that Kaiser, Missouri would not welcome the Juggalo Family, we began receiving phone calls and emails from interested land owners and promoters who wanted to help ensure that the Gathering of the Juggalos found a home. One of the calls we got was from a down ass ninja named Steve who owns the Legend Valley. [...] Steve has actually been to the Gathering of the Juggalos before and is not buying into the media's portrayal of what the Gathering is because he has been there. He has expressed to us that he is super down to host the Gathering this year and has always found Juggalos to be cool ass people. He also believes in our fight alongside the ACLU to have Juggalos removed from the FBI gang list, which is still on the list as a \\"loosely organized hybrid gang\\" because their sorry ass case was thrown out of court in 2014. In other words, he has our backs and is the perfect ninja we needed to ensure an awesome, trouble-free Gathering this year.\\" Legend Valley, Ohio hosted the fifteenth annual Gathering of the Juggalos, which took place between July 23, 2014 and July 27, 2014. Advertised as \\"Shangri-La on Earth\\", this Gathering has over 70 artists scheduled to perform, including the entire Psychopathic Records roster and several notable guests such as Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Cypress Hill, Cannibal Corpse, Kottonmouth Kings, Tech N9ne, Da Mafia 6ix, and other artists. Also scheduled to perform are several comedians, including (most notably) Gilbert Gottfried. Three special parties are planned for the gathering: Kuma's Psychopathic All-Star Party, DJ Clay's Horney Nuts and Big Butts Party, and the Frothy Murder Mix Foam Party. Alongside all these events will be dance competitions, several contests, and Juggalo Championship Wrestling events (including JCW's Road to Bloodymania and Bloodymania 8), plus carnival rides, the annual ICP seminar, auctions, and more. In addition, it was announced via the Insane Clown Posse's Twitter account that there was to be a new Dark Lotus album slated for the 2014 Gathering. It was announced at the Insane Clown Posse seminar at Legend Valley that the Gathering of the Juggalos would be held in ColoradoColorado in 2017. On April 11, 2017, Faygoluvers.net announced that GOTJ18 would be held in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at the Lost Lakes Amphitheater on July 26 through 29. GOTJ19 was scheduled to return to Legend Valley on July 18‚Äì21, 2018. On January 31, 2019, during the Juggalo show, it was announced that the 20th annual GOTJ would take place in Springville, Indiana at Lawrence County Recreational Park from July 31 through August 3, 2019. On January 6, 2020, ICP announced on social media that the 21st annual Gathering of the Juggalos would return to Garrettsville, Ohio at Nelson Ledges Quarry Park \\"Crystal Forest\\" for the first time in 15 years to be held August 5‚Äì8, 2020. On April 22, 2020, however, the concert was cancelled for the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2020/04/22/insane- clown-posse-calls-off-juggalos-festival/3009059001/ Performers Kottonmouth Kings performed at the first festival and numerous others since.

Juggalo Championship Wrestling currently hosts JCW Try-Outs, Oddball Wrestling, Flashlight Wrestling, and Bloodymania at every Gathering event. Popular media Psychopathic Records‚Äô infomercial for the 2009 Gathering of the Juggalos was parodied on the television sketch comedy Saturday Night Live. The sketch, titled \\"Kickspit Underground Rock Festival\\", aired on the December 5 edition of the show. Joseph Bruce stated that he was not offended by the parody, and that he thought that the sketch was \\"hilarious\\" and \\"a humongous compliment\\". The \\"Kickspit Underground Rock Festival\\" has since become a recurring series of sketches. Performer Tila Tequila was hit with bottles at the 2010 event, which resulted in coverage by numerous media outlets. Tila claimed that she would sue Juggalo Gathering LLC, but never did. In 2011, the hit television show Workaholics aired an episode called \\"Straight Up Juggahos\\". The episode revolved around an Insane Clown Posse concert, which acted as a direct parody of the Gathering of the Juggalos. In June 2011, comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade received a cease and desist from Insane Clown Posse for titling one of their performances \\"The Gathering Of The Juggalos For A Mother Fucking Baby Funeral.\\" In an episode of The Simpsons titled The Saga of Carl, the character Carl wins the lottery alongside his friends Moe, Homer, and Lenny. After a deal was made to split the lottery money between the four friends, Carl abandoned the group, cashed in the money, and left Springfield. When the other three discovered this, they were enraged. Within the episode, after finding out that Carl had ditched them, Moe said that if he ever saw Carl again, he would \\"freeze him, chop him up into ice cubes, and scoop him into the urinal trough at the Gathering of the Juggalos.\\" In 2013, the FilmDrunk Frotcast launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to create a documentary studying the Gathering from an outsider's perspective. The group consisted of photographer Ben Kaplan, comedian Matt Lieb, and film critics Vince Mancini and Laremy Legel. The film, titled Whoop Dreams, premiered in 2014 to decent reviews, and Mancini and Legel have written articles and essays about their experiences. In 2018 the mobile game ICP: The Gathering was released for iOS and Google Play. The game lets players create their own Gathering of the Juggalos festival.

Field is the current chancellor of the University of Tasmania since January 2013. He was the leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party from 1988 until his retirement in 1996. Field is best known for operating in minority government with the support of the Independents, Tasmania's nascent Green party, with an agreement known as the Labor‚ÄìGreen Accord. Biography Field grew up on the north-west coast of Tasmania, he attended Devonport High School and graduated from the University of Tasmania with a Bachelor of Arts in history and political science in 1971, where he resided at St. John Fisher College. He was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for Braddon in 1976. He was at various times a cabinet minister, premier and leader of the opposition over twenty years. At the 1989 state election, Labor suffered a one-seat swing. However, the incumbent Liberal government under Robin Gray lost two seats, and in the process lost its majority. The balance of power rested with the Greens, who won five seats. Field then reached an agreement with Independent leader Bob Brown, giving him enough support to form government by one seat. Gray had initially intended to form a minority government. When the accord was signed on 29 May, Gray asked the Governor, Sir Phillip Bennett, for new elections. However, Bennett refused, concluding that Gray no longer had enough support to govern and had therefore lost the right to seek a dissolution. The Greens had also privately assured him that they would support a Labor minority government. This was tested on the floor of the house and a motion was passed that expressed no confidence in Gray and confidence in Field. Bennett then duly commissioned Field as premier. Field's government presided over painful fiscal reforms that, while unpopular at the time, helped rehabilitate the state's finances in the long run. The Greens terminated the accord in 1990, but Field was able to survive a confidence vote in 1991. However, at the 1992 state election, Labor was severely punished not only for its fiscal belt- tightening, but for dealing with the Greens. Its popular vote plummeted to 28.9 percent, while the Liberals won a solid majority. Despite this severe defeat, Field was not blamed for the debacle and stayed on as leader. Field stayed on through a federal intervention in the state Labor Party, and led Labor into the 1996 state election. Field promised that he would only govern in majority. He also promised that if the Liberals were reduced to a minority government, he would not bring it down in its first year. At the election, Labor took three seats. While this cost the Liberals their majority, it was short of what it needed to make Field premier once again. Although Labor and the Greens had enough seats between them to form government, Field kept his word and did not seek Green support to govern. This left a Liberal minority government supported by the Greens as the only realistic option. However, Groom had also promised only to govern in majority, and resigned as premier in favour of Tony Rundle, who reached a deal with the Greens. Since retiring from politics in 1997, Field began working as a management and leadership consultant. In 2003, Field was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his service to the Parliament of Tasmania. He received a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) from the University of Tasmania in 2000 for his service to the state and the university. Field was chairman of the Tasmanian Innovations Advisory Board from its inception in 1999. On 3 July 2012, Field was announced as the chancellor of the University of Tasmania, with effect from January 2013. Field and his wife, Jan, reside on the Tasman Peninsula, and they have three children: Emma Field, Claire Field and Tom Field. Field's last election as ALP leader in 1996 saw the entrance to Parliament of popular union leader Jim Bacon, who was touted as a potential ALP leader. When Field retired in 1997, Bacon did not hesitate in succeeding him as leader, and Bacon became premier when he led the party back to power a year later in 1998.

C. Escher's Gravitation, near the Mesa+ Institute of Universiteit Twente A polyhedron model is a physical construction of a polyhedron, constructed from cardboard, plastic board, wood board or other panel material, or, less commonly, solid material. Since there are 75 uniform polyhedra, including the five regular convex polyhedra, five polyhedral compounds, four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, and thirteen Archimedean solids, constructing or collecting polyhedron models has become a common mathematical recreation. Polyhedron models are found in mathematics classrooms much as globes in geography classrooms. Polyhedron models are notable as three-dimensional proof-of-concepts of geometric theories. Some polyhedra also make great centerpieces, tree toppers, Holiday decorations, or symbols. The Merkaba religious symbol, for example, is a stellated octahedron. Constructing large models offer challenges in engineering structural design. Construction A net for the regular dodecahedron Construction begins by choosing a size of the model, either the length of its edges or the height of the model. The size will dictate the material, the adhesive for edges, the construction time and the method of construction. The second decision involves colours. A single-colour cardboard model is easiest to construct -- and some models can be made by folding a pattern, called a net, from a single sheet of cardboard. Choosing colours requires geometric understanding of the polyhedron. One way is to colour each face differently. A second way is to colour all square faces the same, all pentagonal faces the same, and so forth. A third way is to colour opposite faces the same. Many polyhedra are also coloured such that no same-coloured faces touch each other along an edge or at a vertex. :For example, a 20-face icosahedron can use twenty colours, one colour, ten colours, or five colours, respectively. An alternative way for polyhedral compound models is to use a different colour for each polyhedron component. Net templates are then made. One way is to copy templates from a polyhedron-making book, such as Magnus Wenninger's Polyhedron Models, 1974 (). A second way is drawing faces on paper or with computer-aided design software and then drawing on them the polyhedron's edges. The exposed nets of the faces are then traced or printed on template material. A third way is using the software named Stella to print nets. A model, particularly a large one, may require another polyhedron as its inner structure or as a construction mold. A suitable inner structure prevents the model from collapsing from age or stress. The net templates are then replicated onto the material, matching carefully the chosen colours. Cardboard nets are usually cut with tabs on each edge, so the next step for cardboard nets is to score each fold with a knife. Panelboard nets, on the other hand, require molds and cement adhesives. Assembling multi-colour models is easier with a model of a simpler related polyhedron used as a colour guide. Complex models, such as stellations, can have hundreds of polygons in their nets. Interactive computer models Recent computer graphics technologies allow people to rotate 3D polyhedron models on a computer video screen in all three dimensions. Recent technologies even provide shadows and textures for a more realistic effect.

Located at Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City, Philippines. It was founded in 1919 by Don Vicente Fabella, the Philippines' first certified accountant. Jos√© Rizal University joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 1927. The college varsity teams are called the Jose Rizal University Heavy Bombers. It is one of the schools situated in the east side of Mandaluyong City, the others being Arellano University ‚Äì Plaridel Campus and Don Bosco Technical College. History Jos√© Rizal University was established in 1919 by Vicente Fabella. Fabella was the first Filipino certified public accountant. The university was originally known as Far Eastern College Schools of Accounts, Commerce and Finance and was situated along Arlegui Street. In 1921, it transferred to Hidalgo Street and changed its name to Jos√© Rizal College the year after. It closed operations throughout the Japanese occupation of the Philippines as Fabella joined the guerrilla movement. The closure was also a symbol of opposition against the Japanese. After the Second World War, in 1946, it reopened and moved to its present location in Mandaluyong in 1949. Originally offering commerce and high school degrees, the college expanded its offerings to include an elementary school, education and liberal arts at the undergraduate level, and law, business administration, public administration, and education at the graduate level. It has its own research publication, the Journal of Business, Education and Law. The college is especially proud of Ramon Magsaysay, who graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1932 and who subsequently became the seventh President of the Philippines. Jos√© Rizal University was declared a university by the Commission on Higher Education in 2000. It was granted autonomous status by CHED \\"from 6 October 2009 to 5 October 2012\\".Ched Resolution 013-2009 This is the highest form of certification that can be granted to a Higher Education Institution. As at end of October 2009, only 44 (2.5%) out of 1,726 higher educational institutions in the Philippines had been granted autonomous status by CHED. Academic programsLaw School= Objectives The primary purpose of the law school is to prepare men and women to meet the needs of progress and modern technology in the various aspects of the practice of law. These needs call not only for technical skills but also for responsible leadership in the development of the law and the administration of justice. It is in response to these needs that the four-year curriculum leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) was offered in 1967. =Graduate School= *Doctor in Business Administration (D.B.A.) *Doctor in Public Administration (D.P.A.) *Master in Business Administration (M.B.A.) *Master in Public Administration (M.P.A.) *Master of Arts in Education (M.A.Ed.) =College= right Courses Offered All courses offered in the College Division are recognized by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. In addition, the undergraduate programs have been accredited by the Philippine Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines, and qualified by the Commission on Higher Education and the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. The collegiate undergraduate programs in Commercial Science, Liberal Arts and Education have been granted Level III accreditation by Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation and the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines, and qualified by the Commission on Higher Education. In addition, the University was granted a deregulated status by the Commission on Higher Education to recognize its commitment and contribution to the promotion of quality education.

Students Organizations There are several of student organizations in the campus, all under the leadership of students with faculty supervision. From time to time, the different organizations sponsor convocations and open forum on subjects of current interest. Notable speakers with special knowledge of the topic are usually invited. The Central Student Council The highest student body on the campus, the Central Student Council prepares students for leadership in the community outside the College. It is composed of the officers of the different recognized campus organizations and advised by a senior faculty member.

One of her most notable accomplishments is winning the 1991 Ingeborg Bachmann Prize. √ñzdamar's literary work has received much recognition and scholarly attention. A lover of poetry, she found great inspiration in the works of Heinrich Heine and Bertolt Brecht, especially from an album of the latter's songs which she had bought in the 1960s in Berlin. She later decided to study with Brecht's disciple Benno Besson in Berlin, where she currently resides.√ñzdamar, Emine Segi. \\"Der Hof im Spiegel: Erz√§hlungen (K√∂ln: Kiepenheuer & Witsch Verlag, 2001) Personal life Emine Sevgi √ñzdamar was born the tenth of August 1946 in Malatya, Turkey. She grew up with her grandparents and lived in the Turkish cities of Istanbul and Bursa. In 1965, √ñzdamar travelled to Berlin for the first time and got a job in a factory there. She originally came to Germany to be near her older brother, Ali, who studied in Switzerland at the time. It was not easy to immigrate to Switzerland, hence her move to Germany. Emine Sevgi √ñzdamar had acted and performed plays since she was twelve years old and originally wanted to do both when she came to Europe: acting and seeing her brother. √ñzdamar's parents were against their 18-year-old daughter's plan, but gave in eventually. She lived in a residence in West Berlin with 120 other Turkish women. When she came to Germany for the first time, she did not speak a word of German, so she faced the challenges of learning the language as an adult. √ñzdamar began by memorizing street names and headlines of newspapers without knowing the actual meaning behind them. 1 After seven months, her father finally paid for her to take language classes at the Goethe Institute in order to learn the language properly. √ñzdamar still wanted to become an actress, so she went back to Istanbul after two years, where she started to take acting lessons and got her first big roles in theatre productions. In 1971, a military coup in Istanbul resulted in persecution of citizens and had a great effect on citizens' freedom of speech. It became suddenly important for those in Turkey to choose their words wisely and to start using language differently. This was when √ñzdamar started to abalienate with her mother tongue, Turkish. She moved back to Germany and fell in love with the German language and authors like Bertolt Brecht. √ñzdamar went back in 1976 to work as a director's assistant for the Volksb√ºhne in East Berlin. She lived in West Berlin, but worked in East Berlin at the time. While touring with a play she also lived in France for another two years, before coming back to Germany and working at a theatre in Bochum in 1979. Emine Sevgi √ñzdamar currently lives Kreuzberg, Berlin with her husband Karl Kneidl. Literary Career (Major Works) In 1990, √ñzdamar published her debut short stories collection, Mutterzunge (Mothertongue). It was named ‚ÄúInternational Book of the Year‚Äù by the Times Literary Supplement. The short stories explore the identity of a Turkish woman living in Germany and how inextricably linked to language this identity is. The narrator has lost her mother tongue, Turkish, and speaks fluent, but flawed, German. The narrator remembers an occasion when she and her mother were speaking Turkish, ‚ÄúMeine Mutter sagte mir: ‚ÄòWei√üt du, du sprichst so, du denkst, da√ü du alles erz√§hlst, aber pl√∂tzlich springst du √ºber nichtgesagte W√∂rter‚Äô‚Äù (My mother said to me: ‚ÄòYou know, you talk as though you think you‚Äôre telling me everything, but you suddenly jump over unsaid words‚Äô). √ñzdamar points out that with ‚Äútongue‚Äù, she did not mean language, but the physical tongue in her mother's mouth, ‚Äúein warmes K√∂rperteil, die Liebesquelle meiner Sprache, meiner Gef√ºhle, meiner Kindheit, meiner Jugend.‚Äù (‚Äúthe warm body part, the love source of my language, my feelings, my childhood, my adolescence.‚Äù) Emine Sevgi √ñzdamar's first novel, Das Leben ist eine Karawanserei hat zwei T√ºren aus einer kam ich rein aus der anderen ging ich raus (Life is a Caravanserai : Has Two Doors I Went in One I Came out the Other), published in 1992, earned her the prestigious Ingeborg Bachmann prize (1991) for single chapters from the novel. This made her the first author of Turkish origin to win the prize and gained her international recognition as a novelist. In the novel, the unnamed first narrator traces life from childhood and adolescence in Turkey, to moving from one place in Turkey to another as the father searches for employment, and at last to the narrator's final departure from her family to Germany in order to start a new life. The text is impressionistic, filled with immediacy and sensual narration, but makes no attempt to unify these episodes. The first novel ends there, where the second one, Die Br√ºcke vom Goldenen Horn (The Bridge of the Golden Horn), published in 1998, begins: the 19 year old leaving for Germany. She travels by train to Berlin and stays there as a guest worker. It is the 1960s, the time of free love and student protests. She eventually travels back to Turkey, where she recognizes that her absence has changed everything. After that, in 2001, √ñzdamar publishes another short story collection, Der Hof im Spiegel (The Courtyard in the Mirror). The narrator observes through the window of her apartment. There are cities: Berlin, Amsterdam, Istanbul. Or a theatre. A train full of guest workers. The living room of an old man. The narrator is standing in the kitchen, on the phone, and watching life in the courtyard happen in her mirror. The mirror also holds all the dead. She speaks of ‚Äûher Berlin‚Äú, the first and the second Berlin (separated by 9 years of distance, the first being West-Berlin, the second East-Berlin), the impressions of Istanbul; she speaks of death, of love, of sorrow, of pleasure, and does so while moving through space and time. Her novel, 2003, Seltsame Sterne starren zur Erde (Strange Stars Stare at the Earth), describes √ñzdamar's time working at the Volksb√ºhne theatre in East-Berlin. She lives in Wedding and finds herself in No Man's Land between East and West Berlin. At the time (1970's), Istanbul is fraught with unrest. Certain things were not allowed to be said; √ñzdamar finds a place for these words to be said on the stage in the theatre in Berlin. Her most recent work of prose, 2007, is also her first prose to be written in Turkish. Kendi Kendinim Terzisi Bir Kambur, Ece Ayhan'lƒ± anƒ±lar, 1974 Z√ºrih g√ºnl√ºƒü√º, Ece Ayhan'ƒ±n mektuplarƒ± (The Hunchback as his own Tailor, Memories of Ece Ayhan: The Zurich Diary of 1974 and Letters from Ece Ayhan). It draws upon diary entries connected to her friendship with director Vasif √ñng√∂ren. . Literary Career (Major Themes) Migration ‚ÄúI am a person who prefers to be in transit. My favourite place is to sit on the train between the countries. The train is a beautiful home.‚Äù √ñzdamar's work is often partially autobiographical. The train between Germany and Turkey, between Europe and Asia is the landscape, which closely describes the life and the work of Emine Sevgi √ñzdamar. In her most autobiographical texts, √ñzdamar takes the reader with her on these train journeys between two worlds, where one can experience the complexity of feelings and impressions that come with migration, with moving to a new space, returning to the old, and finding oneself in-between strangeness and familiarity. ‚Äû√ñzdamar has made migration a key conceptual and aesthetic programme in her work‚Äú, so the jury states after congratulating √ñzdamar on winning the 2001 Nordrhein-Westfalen artist award (K√ºnstlerinnenpreis). Identity, German-Turkish Identity √ñzdamar's prose ‚Äúoften calls attention to the heterogeneity of Turkish culture and so represents an important intervention in the nationalist discourses of ‚ÄòTurkishness‚Äô circulating in both Turkey and Germany.‚Äù In her short story collection Der Hof im Spiegel (Courtyard in the Mirror, 2001), for example, she writes ‚ÄûIch liebe das Wort Gastarbeiter, ich sehe immer zwei Personen vor mir. Einer ist Gast und sitzt da, der andere arbeitet‚Äù (I love the word guest-worker, I always see two people in front of me. One is a guest and sits there; the other one works). √ñzdamar's texts also undermine any notion of an ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô Turkish identity; her texts are concerned with tradition and its decontextualization, and raise questions of what role tradition plays in the formation of identity. Modern Scholarship and Interpretations √ñzdamar's winning of the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize led to a wide reaching discussion on what constitutes German literature and Emine Sevgi √ñzdamar became the ‚Äúleading light‚Äù of what is called Turkish-German literature. This insular and limited term has been critiqued by √ñzdamar herself, who would rather be seen as an individual than part of a category. Early scholarship often looked at √ñzdamar's work through a sociological lens focusing on language, identity and life writing. In the 2000s, √ñzdamar's work was more closely interlinked with postcolonial theory and accentuated her dealing with memory, translation and intertextuality. Later perspectives through which √ñzdamar's work was reflected on take on a more philosophical and aesthetic form and bring her in conversation with thinkers and artists such as Deleuze and Guattari or the early Surrealists. Style/Influences One of √ñzdamar's identifiers is her unique language, which she created partially through a literal translation of Turkish expressions or catchwords, through playing with philosophical and literary quotations, and the Broken German used by the guest workers. The result was: ‚ÄúDeutschland, ein W√∂rterm√§rchen\\" (Germany, a Words-Fairytale‚Äîa play on Heine's Deutschland. Ein Winterm√§rchen). \\"Damals kam ich auf die Idee von Deutschland als T√ºr, durch die man hinein- oder hinausgeht. Und auf die Frage: Was passiert dabei mit der Sprache?\\" (Back then, an idea came to me of Germany as a door, through which one walks in or walks out. And I thought of the question: What happens to language then?‚Äù, she says in a lively Caf√© in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Influences include Faulkner, Joyce, Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Joseph Conrad, B√∂ll and Brecht, and contemporary Turkish poets such as Can Y√ºcel, Ece Ayhan, Orhan Veli and Jewish-German poet Else Lasker- Sch√ºler.‚ÄúDurch sie habe ich eine Zeit erfahren, nach der ich immer Sehnsucht hatte, die Zeit vor den Katastrophen.‚Äù(Through her I experienced a time I had always longed for, the time before the catastrophes.), √ñzdamar recounts.  Acting/Directing Career  Upon her return to Istanbul in 1967, √ñzdamar enrolled in a well-known acting school until 1970. Her interests were already present before her initial period in Germany, but was only further solidified through an encounter with a left-wing Turkish director in Berlin, Vasif √ñng√∂ren. In Turkey, she would also go on to star in √ñng√∂ren's Turkish productions of Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade and Bertolt Brecht's Mann ist Mann, amongst others. It was at this time that she also became involved in the Turkish workers‚Äô party. This, however, came to an end with the Turkish military putsch of 1971. Diaries of this friendship form the basis of her most recent book and also first of her prose to be written in Turkish, Kendi Kendinim Terzisi Bir Kambur, Ece Ayhan'lƒ± anƒ±lar, 1974 Z√ºrih g√ºnl√ºƒü√º, Ece Ayhan'ƒ±n makruplarƒ± (The Hunchback as his own Tailor, Memories of Ece Ayhan: The Zurich Diary of 1974 and Letters from Ece Ayhan). When √ñzdamar returned to Germany in 1976, she secured a position as director's assistant at the well- known Volksb√ºhne theatre to Swiss director Benno Besson. There she worked very closely within Brecht's theatrical practice with people such as Matthias Langhoff, Manfred Karge and Heiner M√ºller, before moving for a short time to France to continue working with Besson and study for a PhD in theatre. √ñzdamar's connection to theatre persisted into the 1980s with a certain period spent as director's assistant and actress at Claus Peymann's Bochumer Ensemble in West Germany. The interesting intersection of East-German Post-Brechtian theatre together with German-influence Turkish schools of the 1960s and 1970s is evident in both √ñzdamar's writing style for theatre as well as diverse theatre performances. She has also acted in various films depicting Turkish- Germany, earning herself the title ‚ÄúMutter aller Filmt√ºrken‚Äù (Mother of all Turks on Film).

By some authors it was also depicted as the first one in continental Europe, even though the electromechanical computers Zuse Z4 and the Swedish BARK preceded it. Overview MESM was created by a team of scientists under the direction of Sergei Alekseyevich Lebedev from the Kiev Institute of Electrotechnology in the Soviet Union, at Feofaniya (near Kiev). Initially, MESM was conceived as a layout or model of a Large Electronic Calculating Machine and letter \\"M\\" in the title meant \\"model\\" (prototype). Work on the machine was research in nature, in order to experimentally test the principles of constructing universal digital computers. After the first successes and in order to meet the extensive governmental needs of computer technology, it was decided to complete the layout of a full-fledged machine capable of \\"solving real problems\\". MESM became operational in 1950. It had about 6,000 vacuum tubes and consumed 25 kW of power. It could perform approximately 3,000 operations per minute. It was long and about tall. Creation and operation history * Principal computer architecture scheme was ready by the end of 1949. As well as a few schematic diagrams of an individual blocks. * In 1950 the computer was mounted in a two-story building of the former hostel of a convent in Feofania, where a psychiatric hospital was located before the second world war. * November 6, 1950 - team performed the first test launch.

The team currently plays in the , having moved from the junior leagues in 2018. The club was formed in 1950, following the establishment of the Easthouses Colliery earlier in the 20th Century. Home matches are played at Newbattle Complex. In May 2019 the club became a full member of Scottish Football Association. HistoryOriginal Junior club= Easthouses Lily F.C. were originally formed in 1950 and competed in the Edinburgh and District Junior League, a forerunner of today's East Region Junior leagues. Their first season as a Junior club was 1950‚Äì51 and was their best, finishing as runners-up to Newtongrange Star in the Mid/East Division, with Star going onto lift the Championship after beating West Division winners Camelon Juniors in the play-off. The following few seasons saw finishes in the top half of the league including fourth place in 1953‚Äì54, however life was always difficult living in the shadow of neighbours Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic, Newtongrange Star and Dalkeith Thistle, and the bottom half of the table gradually became the norm. Season 1958‚Äì59 saw the club reach the Quarter-Finals of the Scottish Junior Cup. A 3‚Äì1 win in the first round over local rivals Dalkeith Thistle was followed up with a 4‚Äì3 win at Camelon in the second, they received a bye in the third round, the fourth round Lily recorded a 4‚Äì1 win at Murray Park over Inverurie Locos before a narrow 1‚Äì0 home win over West Calder United in the fifth round led to a Quarter Final meeting at Shettleston, which they lost 3‚Äì0. Shettleston went on to lose the final at Hampden to Irvine Meadow. The following season the fourth round was reached after wins over Nairn Thistle, Dundonald Bluebell plus another bye, leading to a meeting with Ardeer Thistle in Ayshire which they lost 6‚Äì2. However that turned out to be a couple of rare bright spots and after four successive seasons finishing second bottom with a dramatic fall in attendance numbers, the club encountered difficulties and they were left with no option but to fold at the end of season 1964‚Äì65. After a break of a season a new club, Easthouses & Mayfield United joined the Mid/East Division for season 1966‚Äì67 and brought Junior football back to the town, but they only registered 10 league wins in three seasons and withdrew at the end of season 1968‚Äì69. =Rebirth= However that year a group of local friends (James Forrest, James (Cobie) Lamb, Brian McGuff, Robert Paul and George Peacock) reformed the original Easthouses Lily. They began life as members of the Scottish Welfare Football Association, playing in the Lothian Welfare FA and quickly found success by winning numerous pieces of silverware. Perhaps the club's greatest achievement at that time was reaching the semi-final of the prestigious Scottish Welfare Cup in 1978, where they met Singers F.C. of Clydebank. However, in front of a 2000+ crowd at King's Park, Dalkeith, they lost 2‚Äì1 to the side who would eventually go on to lift the trophy. In 1981, the club joined the ranks of the East Of Scotland Football Association and the East of Scotland Football League where they played at Murray Park, Easthouses. Their first match was a derby against Whitehill Welfare, where a very respectable performance saw them draw 1‚Äì1 thanks to a Davy McWhinnie goal. Four days later, the first home game drew a large crowd, who witnessed an eventful, but goalless draw with Civil Service Strollers. Having made Murray Park something of a fortress, the Lily were forced to find a new home when the owners, Murray Brewers, decided to sell the land to a housing developer. The Club transferred its matches to the nearby Newbattle Complex, where they remain to this day. After changing the name to Easthouses Lily Miners Welfare Football Club in 1989, the club enjoyed a ‚Äògolden‚Äô era. The first of three First Division Championships was won in 1990‚Äì91, and this was quickly followed by the Premier Division in 1991‚Äì92. The Lily are the only club to have achieved back-to-back First and Premier titles since league reconstruction in 1987. The Alex Jack Cup was also won in 1990‚Äì91 and began something of a love affair with the trophy, capturing it again in 1998‚Äì99, 2004‚Äì05 and 2006‚Äì07 and finishing runner-up in 1991‚Äì92, 1999‚Äì00 and 2001‚Äì02. The Lily were also runners-up in the League Cup in 2005‚Äì06. =League moves= Easthouses left the East of Scotland League at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season to join the Scottish Junior Football Association, East Region, citing a new challenge as the motive. At the same time, the club also joined other local youth and amateur sides as part of a wider Easthouses Community Club project. Easthouses returned to the East of Scotland Football League in 2018, as part of a larger movement of junior clubs in the east. Managers The team has been managed since January 2003 by David McQueenie. Notable Players After signing for Lily from Juvenile football and playing the 1951‚Äì52 season, Goalkeeper Willie Duff signed for Heart of Midlothian in August 1952 for ¬£200 and went on to win a Scottish Cup and a League Cup winners medal before moving to Charlton Athletic and Peterborough United. He moved back to Scotland with Dunfermline Athletic and helped them reach the European Cup Winners Cup semi-final in 1969. Another goalkeeper, George Ramage signed for Third Lanark in 1957 before moving south to join Colchester United and eventually finish his career in Australia.

History The club was founded around 1945 as Heriot-Watt College F.C. After Heriot-Watt became a university and moved most of its activity to its new campus at Riccarton, (a move which was substantially complete by 1971), the club, now named Heriot-Watt University F.C., applied to join the East of Scotland Football Association and League. It played in the league for the first time in season 1971‚Äì72 and has continued in membership since that time. For the first three decades of its membership of the East of Scotland League, the club struggled to make an impact, although it did reach the Final of the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup in season 1973‚Äì74. The early years of the new century saw an improvement in the club's performances and for the first time it gained promotion to the Premier Division in 2005. The following season under head coach Billy Henderson the club won its first trophy, the East of Scotland League Cup, and finished in second place in the league, two points behind winners Edinburgh City. The club was relegated twice during the course of the next five seasons, but on each occasion returned immediately as First Division champions. A second cup success occurred in 2009 when the King Cup was won. =Student competitions= A large part of the club's purpose is to provide the opportunity for football training and playing to as great a number of students as possible, so seven men's teams and one women's team are entered into the competitions operated by British Universities and Colleges SportScotland ‚Äì British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) and Scottish Student Sport (SSS),Scottish Student Sport :: Our Members: with the matches being played on Wednesday afternoons. The Queen's Park Shield is the most prestigious trophy for male student football clubs from Scottish Universities and Colleges. HWUFC first won the QPS in the 1972/73 season when the club shared it with the University of Aberdeen Football club. Despite winning ten games from ten across the season, HWUFC were docked points by the Scottish Amateur Football Association due to playing an ineligible player in an entirely separate East of Scotland League fixture that same season. Kenny Laird, who was previously registered as a professional player with Peebles Rovers Football club had been registered as an amateur player by HWUFC - due to this the club was banned from all football for five months and stripped of the Queen's Park Shield title. Following an appeal, it was agreed that the trophy would be shared with second placed side, the University of Aberdeen FC. The club wouldn't win the QPS again until the 2002‚Äì03 season. In what was undoubtedly the 'Golden Generation' for the club, the trophy was retained the following four seasons. This five in a row achievement was the first of its kind by any University in the modern era of the competition.

The club resigned from the league after three games of the 2015‚Äì16 season. Their final game was against Burntisland Shipyard on 29 August 2015 resulting in a 5‚Äì0 defeat. The club was founded at a meeting in the Drill Hall, Kelso, in April 1935. Kelso played their home matches at Woodside Park on Dry House Lane. The first league the club played in was the Border Junior League. Their first notable success at this level was winning the Dudley Cup in 1935. The next season, United joined the Berwickshire FA, despite being based in Roxburghshire. The 1937‚Äì38 season was very successful for the club, as the Conan Doyle Cup, the Dudley Cup and the league championship shield were all added to the honours list. Although no-one from Kelso at that time became an internationalist, many went to bigger, professional clubs. After the war Kelso United reformed and entered a second XI into the Kelso and District League, while the main team played in the Border Amateur league. In the 1957‚Äì58 season, the club lifted the South of Scotland Cup East section, but lost the overall final to West section winners Broughton. The 1959‚Äì60 season was another good year with the Border Cup and the Ancrum 5-a-side competition being annexed. In the mid-60s after a massive gap of 29 years, United were once again Border Amateur League champions. Big decisions were made leading up to 1967‚Äì68 season, one was that the first team would join the East of Scotland Football League, and that the second team which had disappeared, would reform and take the first teams place in the Border League. This was a successful move as the United team were League and King Cup runners-up. In 1971, the club decided to work more on bringing in local players, but this was not sustainable and they left the East of Scotland League. However, back in the Amateur League the club flourished, conquering the Beveridge Cup, as well as the South of Scotland Cup. In 1974 they won the Border Cup. By the 1974‚Äì75 season, the club felt ready to rejoin the East of Scotland League, and in 1980 won their biggest cup yet, the King Cup. Since then the club have held their own in the league, reaching the final of the Image Printers Cup in the mid-90s, as well as getting promoted to the Premier league in 2004, although they were relegated at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. In September 2015, the club resigned from the East of Scotland League and merged with nearby Kelso Thistle to form Kelso United Thistle, who now play in the Border Amateur League.

History Founded in 1969 as an amateur works team for Lloyds Finance, they initially competed as Lloyds & Scottish prior to renaming themselves as Lothian Thistle. The club originally competed in the Lothian amateur league before a successful spell in the Caledonian Amateur Football League. They then moved up to senior status when they joined the East of Scotland Football League in 1995, gaining promotion to the Premier Division two years later in 1997. The club is linked with the youth football club Hutchison Vale, and changed their name to Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale before the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season to reflect this. LTHV won the East of Scotland Premier Division title for the first time in the 2013‚Äì14 season, repeating this success in the 2014‚Äì15 season. They were runners-up in 2015‚Äì16 and won the league for the third time in 2016‚Äì17, although they did not take part in the play-off for promotion to the Lowland League because they were ineligible for licensing reasons.

After moving to Britain in 1965, they had a number of top ten albums and singles there, including the No. 1 chart hits \\"Make It Easy on Yourself\\" and \\"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)\\", both of which also made the US top 20 and Canadian top 2. In between the two was the lesser US hit \\"My Ship is Coming In\\", which was another major hit in Britain, where it reached No.3 in the charts. The trio split up in 1968, but reunited in the mid-to-late-1970s and scored a final top 10 UK hit with \\"No Regrets\\". Formed in 1964, they adopted the 'Walker Brothers' name as a show business touch even though the members were all unrelated ‚Äî \\"simply because we liked it.\\" They provided a unique counterpoint to the British Invasion by achieving much more success in the United Kingdom than in their home country, a period when the popularity of British bands such as The Beatles dominated the U.S. charts. HistoryFormation= The Walker Brothers Trio was formed in Los Angeles in 1964 by John Walker (lead vocals, guitar), Scott Engel (bass, harmony vocals), and drummer Al \\"Tiny\\" Schneider. Before then, John Walker‚Äîwho had already been using that name professionally for several years‚Äîhad performed and recorded several unsuccessful singles with his sister as a duo, John and Judy, and Engel had been bass player with instrumental band The Routers. Walker and Engel, with two other musicians, had also toured the Midwest in 1963 as \\"The Surfaris,\\" although the group included none of the musicians who played on the Surfaris' records. Dropping the word \\"Trio,\\" Walker and Engel were signed by Mercury Records, recorded a single, \\"Pretty Girls Everywhere,\\" and became a leading attraction at Gazzari's Club in Hollywood. They also appeared on the Shindig! TV show, developed by Jack Good, and then on a weekly TV show, Ninth Street A Go Go. Late in 1964, they met drummer Gary Leeds, previously of The Standells (Late 1962‚Äì1964). He had recently toured the UK with singer P.J. Proby. Leeds ‚Äì along with club regular Brian Jones ‚Äì persuaded them that the band's rock and roll and blues style would go down well in \\"swinging London,\\" where Proby had already succeeded. Before leaving, they recorded their second single, \\"Love Her,\\" overseen by Nick Venet and arranger Jack Nitzsche, with Scott Engel taking the lead vocal part for the first time‚Äîpreviously John Walker had been the lead vocalist. They also appeared in a film, Beach Ball, and sent demo recordings to record labels in the United Kingdom. With financial backing from Leeds' stepfather, Walker, Engel and Leeds traveled to the UK in February 1965 for an exploratory visit. =Success in the UK= The group in 1965 When they landed in England, record producer Johnny Franz was keen to sign them up. In a short time, Walker and Engel had secured a recording contract with Philips Records, an affiliate of Mercury, and had played several venues around the UK, with Leeds as drummer. Along with the group's relocation came a change in image, abandoning matching suits and pompadours in favor of the mop top haircuts and casual attire typical of British pop stars. Their first single, \\"Pretty Girls Everywhere,\\" had little success, but radio stations picked up on the follow-up \\"Love Her\\" with Engel's baritone vocals, and it made the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart in June 1965. The song had originally been recorded by The Everly Brothers and released as B-side to their single \\"The Girl Who Sang The Blues\\" in 1963. Philips then recorded and released the group's version of \\"Make It Easy on Yourself,\\" a Burt Bacharach and Hal David ballad previously recorded by Jerry Butler. It was sung by Engel (by now called Scott Walker), arranged by Ivor Raymonde and produced by Johnny Franz, with a full orchestra augmented by session musicians. Session musicians on the record included Alan Parker and Big Jim Sullivan. By August 1965, \\"Make It Easy on Yourself\\" had entered the UK Top 10, eventually reaching the top of the record chart. Later in the year, it also reached No. 16 in the US Billboard Hot 100. The track sold 250,000 copies in the UK, and over one million copies globally, achieving gold disc status. The number 3 UK hit \\"My Ship Is Coming In\\", originally recorded in 1965 by soul singer Jimmy Radcliffe, followed. Then in March 1966, The Walker Brothers hit No. 1 for the second time in six months with \\"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore.\\" Their popularity in the UK ‚Äì particularly that of Scott ‚Äì reached a new high, especially among teenage girls, and their fan club in that country was said to have been larger than The Beatles.' \\"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore\\" also made the US Top 20, but had less success in the US. The Walker Brothers continued to have chart hits in the UK in 1966 and 1967, with Scott taking a more prominent role in their song choices and arrangements, but with diminishing commercial success. They also had to leave the UK for six months in 1967 because of work permit problems. As pop music moved on, the Walker Brothers began to sound dated. By the end of 1967, the pressures of stardom, internal tensions and 'artistic differences' began to weaken the group. After a UK tour in April 1967, which also featured Jimi Hendrix, Cat Stevens, and Engelbert Humperdinck, followed by a tour of Japan in 1968, the group officially disbanded. =Reunion in the 1970s= All three continued to release solo records, with Scott (who first recorded solo in 1967) being by far the most successful and creating a large cult following. Late in 1974, Walker, Engel and Leeds agreed to reform The Walker Brothers. In 1975, they released the album No Regrets. The title track was released as a single and rose to No. 7 on the UK chart in early 1976. They recorded two further albums together, Lines (1976) and Nite Flights (1978), which were less commercially successful; the experimental style of Scott's tracks on Nite Flights laid the stylistic groundwork for his later solo career. The Walker Brothers undertook some cabaret performances, although Engel (by now more usually known as Scott Walker) was reluctant to sing live; the group's contract with GTO Records ended and, according to John Walker, the group \\"just drifted apart.\\" =Later activities= John Walker later went on to customise guitars and establish his own recording studio in California, and resumed touring in 2004. Gary Walker remains active in England. Scott Walker continued to record sporadically and engage in cultural works, e.g. curating the Meltdown festival. John and Gary Walker published their own joint autobiography, The Walker Brothers: No Regrets‚ÄîOur Story, in 2009. John died at his Los Angeles home on May 7, 2011; Scott died in London on 22 March 2019, leaving Gary as the last surviving Walker brother. \\"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore\\" and \\"Stay With Me Baby\\" were prominently featured in the 2012 film, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria and starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley. Scott Walker: 30 Century Man is a 2006 documentary film about Scott Walker by Stephen Kijak. The film got its title from the song \\"30 Century Man.\\" It charted Walker's career in music, with a focus on his songwriting, and featured footage of recording sessions for his album, The Drift. It included a sequence in which Walker oversaw the recording of the punching of a joint of pork, for the percussion on the song \\"Clara\\". David Bowie acted as the executive producer of the film.

It is aimed to use GOMOS to build a climatology of ozone and related species in the middle atmosphere (15 to 100 km). Instrument details The 250-680 nm spectral domain is used for the determination of O3, NO2, NO3‚àí, aerosols and temperature. In addition, two high spectral resolution channels centred at 760 and 940 nm allow measurements of O2 and H2O and two fast photometers are used to correct star scintillation perturbations and to determine high vertical resolution temperature profiles. Global latitude coverage is obtained with up to 40 stellar occultations per orbit from South Pole to North Pole. Data acquired on dark limb (night-time) are of better quality than on bright limb (day-time) because of a smaller perturbation by background light.

Early life Anzac, the landing 1915 by George Lambert (1920-1922). Lambert was born in St Petersburg, Russia, the posthumous son of George Washington Lambert (1833 ‚Äì 25 July 1873, in London) of Baltimore, Maryland. The younger Lambert's mother was Annie Matilda, n√©e Firth, an Englishwoman. Mother and son soon moved to W√ºrttemberg, Germany, to be with Lambert's maternal grandfather. Lambert was educated at Kingston College, Yeovil, Somerset. The family, consisting of Lambert, his mother and three sisters, decided to emigrate to Australia. They arrived in Sydney aboard the Bengal on 20 January 1887. Career Miss Thea Proctor Lambert began exhibiting his pictures at the Art Society and the Society of Artists, Sydney in 1894. Lambert began contributing pen-and-ink cartoons for The Bulletin in 1895 and began painting full-time in 1896. Illustrations by Lambert formed part of the bush ballads of the Fair girls and gray horses (1898) and Hearts of gold (1903) anthologies of Scottish- Australian poet Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963). In 1899 he won the Wynne Prize with Across the Blacksoil Plains. He studied at the Julian Ashton Art School in Sydney until 1900. Later, he won a travelling scholarship for 150 pounds from the government of New South Wales. He spent a year in Paris before moving to London where he exhibited at the Royal Academy. Lambert was awarded a silver medal at an international exhibition for his painting The Sonnet in Barcelona in 1911. He was most known during this time as a portrait artist. =War artist= Lambert became an official Australian war artist in 1917 during the First World War. His painting Anzac, the landing 1915 of the landings on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey, is the largest painting at the Australian War Memorial collection. Lambert, as an honorary captain, travelled to Gallipoli in 1919 to make sketches for the painting. Another noted work was A sergeant of the Light Horse (1920), painted in London after his travels in Palestine. During the war years, George Lambert spent much time in London, where it is suggested he was romantically involved with fellow artist Thea Proctor. =Return to Australia= Pan is dead (still life) Lambert returned to Australia in 1921, where he had success in Melbourne with a one man show at Fine Art Society gallery. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1922. He often visited the homestead of Colonel Granville Ryrie of the Australian Light Horse at Michelago, New South Wales and there painted The Squatter's Daughter and Michelago Landscape. In the second annual Archibald Prize in 1922, now Australia's most prestigious art prize for portraiture, Lambert's work was disqualified as he had not been a resident in Australia for twelve months. He submitted a self-portrait for the third year, competing with William Macleod who entered with the subject of The Bulletin cartoonist 'Hop' Hopkins. In 1927 he won the Archibald Prize with his work titled Mrs Murdoch. In November 1927 he was commissioned to create a statue of writer Henry Lawson; the work depicting Lawson in rough clothes accompanied by a swagman, a dog and a fence post was unveiled in The Domain, Sydney on 28 July 1931 by the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Game. Personal life Constant Lambert married Amelia Beatrice 'Amy' Absell (1872‚Äì1963) in 1900. Their children were Maurice Lambert (1901‚Äì1964), a noted sculptor and associate of the Royal Academy, and Constant, the British composer and conductor, born in London in 1905. Kit Lambert (1935‚Äì1981), manager of the rock group The Who, was their grand-child. Lambert died on 29 May 1930 at Cobbitty, near Camden, New South Wales, and is buried in the Anglican section of South Head Cemetery. Some of his family papers from 1874-1942 are held in the State Library of New South Wales, Sydney. Gallery File:Anzacs Bathing in the Sea (George Lambert).jpgAnzacs bathing in the sea File:George W.

It is the oldest high school in Las Vegas and originally opened in 1905 on what was then the outskirts of town. The school's first campus was made a permanent location in 1904 with a tent that opened in 1905. After 29 years the school made a new campus in 1930 that opened in 1931. Then, after 62 years the school moved to a new campus in 1993, located on the east side of Las Vegas along the foothills of Frenchman Mountain.  History  The original campus of Las Vegas High School in 2006, now the campus for the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts. Las Vegas High School's original campus was constructed a tent near the cottonwoods near north Creek of town for the 1905 school year Las Vegas High was the first high school in Las Vegas, but caused much controversy at the time for its location. In the early 1940s, the High School was considered to be quite distant from the rest of the town and was a commute for some students. The school originally had three buildings, the tri-level Main building on the corner of 7th and Bridger, the Gymnasium, and a third building that originally housed wood shops and vocational classes, and later government classes. It was torn down in 1969. Las Vegas High School is now a landmark in Las Vegas for it represents the best of the Art-Deco Style Architecture of the 1930s, that still stands in the city. The school's outer appearance has been maintained but the interior has been changed quite a bit since the original construction in the 1930s. Lieutenant William Harrell Nellis, for whom Nellis Air Force Base is named, graduated from Las Vegas High School. During the late 1980s, the school district decided to build a new larger campus on the east side of Clark County. The original buildings that were Las Vegas High School are now the home to the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies, Performing, and Visual Arts, which opened in 1993.  Athletics  Las Vegas High School's athletics teams are known as the Wildcats and participate in the Northeast Division of the Sunrise 4A Region. The Wildcats athletics programs are some of the best in the state and have won numerous championships with several in football, including the 1944 team which went all eight games without giving up a single point.NIAA Record Book The football team also has two historic rivalries, the Battle of Sunrise Mountain against Eldorado High School, which began in 1993 (and coined by a former 1985 graduate of Eldorado High School) and the Bone Game against Rancho High School, the latter of which is the oldest football rivalry in the state of Nevada.Sir Herkimer's Bone Las Vegas has won 22 consecutive games against Rancho, dating back to 1996. = Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association State Championships = *Baseball ‚Äì 1968, 1971 *Basketball (Men's)- 1944, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1960, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1976 *Basketball (Women's) ‚Äì 1979 *Bowling (Men's) ‚Äì 2017 *Football ‚Äì 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1944, 1945, 1947, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1959, 2001, 2005, 2006 *Golf ‚Äì 1966, 1970 *Soccer (Boys) ‚Äì 2008, 2009, 2018 *Softball ‚Äì 1982 *Volleyball (Boys) ‚Äì 2005, 2008 *Wrestling ‚Äì 1985, 2001, 2002, 2010, 2011 *Track & Field ‚Äì 1930, 1933, 1939, 1941, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1972, 1973, 1993 = Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association State Runners-Up = *Bowling (Men's) ‚Äì 2014 *Football ‚Äì 2003, 2004 *Softball ‚Äì 2007 *Track and Field (Men's) ‚Äì 1999 *Volleyball (Men's) ‚Äì 2014, 2017 *Wrestling ‚Äì 1988, 1991, 2005, 2009 = Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association Individual State Champions = *Bowling (Women's)(1) ‚Äì 2014 Gabriella Weis *Golf (Men's)(1) ‚Äì 2009 Ray Gillup *Track and Field (Men's) ‚Äì 1998 Anthony Park, 1999 John Pollard, 2000 Anthony Parker, 2002 Cory Williams, 2009 Aaron Adkins, 2012 Tony Verdugo, 2016 Tre James, Relay ‚Äì 2001, 2015-400x2 (Elias Miller, Tre' James, Kalin Quailis, Eric Williams) *Track and Field (Women's) ‚Äì 1998 Lillie Williams Relay ‚Äì 2007 *Wrestling(42)- 1979 Adam Hilty, Ben Viray, 1980 Ben Viray, 1983 Tim Monahan, 1985 Mike Brewer, Joel Collins, Dave Rumfield, 1988 Simon Gutierrez, Joey Vidana, 1989 Mihn Nguyen, Scott Hocker, 1990 Frank Quintana, Damon Ruemmele, 1991 Pete Rayner, Rick Villalobos, Damon Ruemmele, 1996 Kelly Brinkerhoff, 1998 Eddy Gifford, 1999 Ricardo Osario, 2001 Greg Gifford, 2002 Chris Gifford, Greg Gifford, 2003 Chris Gifford, 2004 Chris Gifford, 2005 Nick Ruggiero, Zach Brewer, 2006 Mike Ruggiero, 2007 Jarell Price, Zach Hocker, 2009 Madison Hales, 2010 Alex Aniciete, Napoleon Aniciete, Trey McElhaney, 2011 Nathan Garcia, Alex Aniciete, Napoleon Aniciete, 2013 Christopher Caday, Alex Aniciete, 2014 Antonio Jauregui, 2015 Antonio Saldate, 2016 Antonio Saldate, 2017 Mauricio Jimenez NIAA SUNRISE REGION CHAMPIONSHIPS - (1999‚ÄìPresent) Basketball (Men's)- 2000, 2001, 2002 Basketball (Women's)- 2003 Bowling (Men's)- 2014, 2017 Football - 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 Track and Field (Men's) - 2000 Soccer (Men's) - 1999, 2006, 2009 Softball - 2005, 2007 Volleyball (Men's) - 2005, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2017 Wrestling - 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010  Notable alumni  *Toni Basil (1961), pop singer *Sal Bernal (2011), Major League Soccer player *Richard Bryan (1955) *Gabriel Campisi (1986) *Brian Cram (1955), Clark County School Superintendent *Ricardo Dominguez (1978), co- founder of Electronic Disturbance Theater and professor at University of California, San Diego *Erick Fedde (2011), Major League Baseball player *Lloyd D.

Founded in 1893, they play their home matches at Whitestone Park. The club are members of the East of Scotland Football League (EoSFL), in the seventh tier of the Scottish football league system. They were briefly members of the Scottish Football League, between 1923 and 1926. In 2006, Peebles Rovers merged with local youth and amateur teams to form a new community club. The new Peebles F.C. took over Rovers' EoSFL place until 2010, when Rovers demerged and re-established themselves as a separate senior club. History Peebles Rovers were members of the Scottish Football League Third Division between 1923 and 1926, and had only a modest record ‚Äì finishing 14th and 8th in the two full seasons played, and were 14th in the unfinished 1925‚Äì26 season. All told, Peebles Rovers played 86 Scottish Football League matches, winning 28, drawing 15 and losing 43. They scored 159 goals and conceded 190. Their record victory at their Whitestone Park home was 7‚Äì1 against Beith on 18 April 1925. Their best away win was 5‚Äì2 away against Galston, seven days previously on 11 April 1925. In 1937 Peebles Rovers moved from their traditional home in Victoria Park to Whitestone park, after a local businessman successfully managed to acquire planning rights to the eastern end of Victoria Park, intending substantial development that was subsequently curtailed due to the start of World War II. Peebles Rovers themselves were active long before the Third Division, being formed in 1893, and have played in the Scottish Cup proper over twenty times. Their first appearance was back in 1907‚Äì08, when they lost 4‚Äì0 away to Celtic. In their first 11 appearances, they were drawn away from home on each and every occasion, spanning 19 ties in all. They managed to win three of these and draw two, including holding Hibernian to a 0‚Äì0 draw at Easter Road in 1923 ‚Äì easily their best result in the competition. In this season, Paddy McBoyle starred as top scorer with a total of 27 league goals. Other than a replay win over St Cuthbert's Wanderers, they did not have a home tie until beating Keith 7‚Äì3 in 1926. They drew away to Albion Rovers in the next round, before losing the replay. They also drew with their Coatbridge namesakes in 1957, and again lost the replay. The season before that, they were involved in a marathon tie with Brechin City. There was a 1‚Äì1 draw away, 4‚Äì4 at home after extra time, 0‚Äì0 in a second replay at Easter Road, again after extra time and finally losing 6‚Äì2 in a third replay, at Tannadice. After that they took some serious hammerings, losing 10‚Äì0 away to St Mirren in 1959, 6‚Äì1 at home against Ayr United the next year, and then a 15‚Äì1 slaughter away to Hibernian in 1961. Joe Baker scored nine that day and his brother Gerry grabbed four in the earlier debacle at Love Street. During the 1959‚Äì1960 season, there was a record 23‚Äì2 defeat at the hands of Partick Thistle. Their final appearance was better though, in 1965‚Äì66, they drew 2‚Äì2 at Dumbarton and took the Sons to extra time in the replay before losing 3‚Äì2. After the match both sides celebrated the match as an exemplar of what football could be. Their greatest moment in the Qualifying Cup (South) came in the 1953‚Äì54 competition, when they defeated Shawfield Amateurs 6‚Äì1, Burntisland Shipyard 7‚Äì0, Selkirk 4‚Äì2 (all at home) and Coldstream 4‚Äì1 after a 1‚Äì1 draw away to reach the final. After this run of successful, a number of local businessmen in the town attempted to purchase the club and rebrand it \\"Peebles Armadillos\\", but were unsuccessful after players protested in a candlelit vigil in front of the local Parish church. Latterly the club was only an associate member of the Scottish Football Association due to the inadequate facilities at Whitestone Park, thus becoming ineligible to compete in the Qualifying Cup and Scottish Cup. While Peebles Rovers won many minor and local competitions, the highest level they played at, the Third Division apart, is the East of Scotland League, which they won on six occasions ‚Äì 1928‚Äì29, 1932‚Äì33, 1933‚Äì34, 1934‚Äì35, 1935‚Äì36 and 1945‚Äì46. In the 1966‚Äì67, Rovers joined the junior grade of football and entered a period of decline, until they rejoined the senior ranks in the East of Scotland League in 1980‚Äì81. When that set-up was altered to two divisions in the late-1980s, they found themselves in the (lower) First Division, and during this period endured a prolonged period of financial hardship resulting in several members of the squad volunteering in the local town to make ends meet. Although they won promotion several times, their stays in the Premier were of short duration. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Peebles won promotion to the East of Scotland Premier Division, but were relegated back to the First Division in the 2010‚Äì11 season. Largest crowds to watch them have been 14,000 and 10,453, both at Easter Road in the Scottish Cup in 1923 and 1961. The record gate at Whitestone Park is recorded as 1,750 for the 4‚Äì2 first round Scottish Cup win over Gala Fairydean in 1961. Michael Wilson was named the club's new manager in April 2020.

He was co-founder of Moby Grape, and played guitar with them until 1969. He released one solo album, 1969's Oar, and then largely withdrew from the music industry. He had started his career as a guitarist in an early line-up of Quicksilver Messenger Service, and was the drummer on Jefferson Airplane's debut album, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off. He has been described on the AllMusic website as \\"one of psychedelia's brightest lights\\"; however, his career was plagued by drug addictions coupled with mental health problems, and he has been described by a biographer as a man who \\"neither died young nor had a chance to find his way out.\\"Jeff Tamarkin, \\"Skip Spence and The Sad Saga of Moby Grape\\" , gotarevolution.com/index.html; accessed December 31, 2015.

Alexander Spence was a decorated Canadian WW II bomber pilot, having been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In the late 1950s, the family relocated from Windsor to San Jose, California, based on Spence's father finding work in the aircraft industry. At the age of ten, he was given his first guitar by his parents.Pierre Perrone, Obituary: Skip Spence , independent. co.uk, April 20, 1999. = Music career: 1966‚Äì1969 = Spence was a guitarist in the band the Other Side before Marty Balin recruited him to be the drummer for Jefferson Airplane (apparently because he looked the part).For What It's Worth: The Story of Buffalo Springfield. Einarson, John (2004). p. 146. accessed at Google Books , August 30, 2014 Spence drummed on their debut, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off, and was dismissed by the band after taking an unannounced vacation to Mexico. He briefly considered joining Buffalo Springfield as a drummer before returning to the guitar to co-found Moby Grape. During the recording session of Moby Grape's second album, Wow, in 1968, Spence attempted to break down a bandmate's hotel room door with a fire axe, while under the influence of LSD. Spence's deterioration in New York and the \\"fire axe incident\\" are described by bandmate Jerry Miller as follows: \\"Skippy changed radically when we were in New York. There were some people there that were into harder drugs and a harder lifestyle, and some very weird shit. And so he kind of flew off with those people. Skippy kind of disappeared for a little while. Next time we saw him, he had cut off his beard, and was wearing a black leather jacket, with his chest hanging out, with some chains and just sweating like a son of a gun. I don't know what the hell he got a hold of, man, but it just whacked him. And the next thing I know, he axed my door down in the Albert Hotel.University Place and East 11th Street, New York City. Now an apartment building, it was at the time a famous hotel originally owned by the brother of artist Albert Pinkham Ryder. The hotel was named in his honour. Robert Louis Stevenson used one of the hotel's rooms as his studio. Other famous guest was Thomas Wolfe. Patrick Bunyan, All Around The Town: Amazing Manhattan Facts and Curiosities. Fordham University Press, 1999. They said at the reception area that this crazy guy had held an axe to the doorman's head.\\" As described by bandmate Peter Lewis, it appears that both Jerry Miller and bandmate Don Stevenson were targets of Spence: > \\"We had to do (the album) in New York because the producer (David Rubinson) > wanted to be with his family. So we had to leave our families and spend > months at a time in hotel rooms in New York City. Finally I just quit and > went back to California. I got a phone call after a couple of days. They'd > played a Fillmore East gig without me, and Skippy took off with some black > witch afterward who fed him full of acid. It was like that scene in The > Doors movie.

They shot him full of Thorazine for six months. They just > take you out of the game.\\"Interview with Peter Lewis by Jud Cost, 1995; > www.sundazed.com. During his six months in Bellevue, Spence was diagnosed with schizophrenia. On the day of his release, he drove a motorcycle, and as the urban myth goes (and not true according to his wife), dressed in only his pajamas, directly to Nashville to record his only solo album, with no other musicians appearing on it, the now-classic psychedelic/folk album Oar (1969, Columbia Records).This commonly accepted version of events has recently been challenged as being mythical. It is asserted, without citation, that Spence first returned to his wife and family in Santa Cruz and that his family accompanied him to Nashville; see Moby Grape. =Decline: 1970‚Äì1999= During the early 70's Spence also founded and experimented with a three-man rock band called Pachuca and later a larger ensemble called The Rhythm Dukes. He continued to have minor involvement in later Moby Grape projects and reunions. He contributed to 20 Granite Creek (1971) and Live Grape (1978),Karen Schoemer, \\"A Fragile Mind Bent in a Psychedelic Era\\". Contained in Peter Guralnick and Douglas Wolk (eds), Da Capo Best Music Writing 2000 , Da Capo Press. . though his bandmates always included at least one of his songs on group recordings, irrespective of whether he was capable of performing with the group at the time.For example, on Truly Fine Citizen (1969), a Jerry Miller-Skip Spence song, \\"Tongue-Tied\\", was included. On the [ Legendary Grape] album (1989, CD issue 2003), the album starts with a Skip Spence song, \\"(All My Life) I Love You\\", originally recorded by Spence in 1972. Spence was no longer with Moby Grape at the time of Moby Grape '69, yet an earlier song recorded by Spence, \\"Seeing\\", was nonetheless included on the album. He had been similarly remembered by Jefferson Airplane, whereby his song \\"My Best Friend\\" was included on the group's Surrealistic Pillow album (1967), despite his departure from the group.On the 2003 CD reissue of Surrealistic Pillow. an additional Spence song,\\"J.P.P. McStep B. Blues\\", is included as a bonus track. Due to his deteriorating state and notwithstanding that he was no longer functioning in the band, Spence was supported by Moby Grape band members for extended periods. Voluminous consumption of heroin and cocaine resulted in a further involuntary committal for Spence. As described by Peter Lewis, \\"Skippy was just hanging around. He hadn't been all there for years, because he'd been into heroin all that time. In fact he actually OD'ed once and they had him in the morgue in San Jose with a tag on his toe. All of a sudden he got up and asked for a glass of water. Now he was snortin' big clumps of coke, and nothing would happen to him. We couldn't have him around because he'd be pacing the room, describing axe murders. So we got him a little place of his own. He had a little white rat named Oswald that would snort coke too. He'd never washed his dishes, and he'd try to get these little grammar school girls to go into the house with him. He was real bad. One of the parents finally called the cops, and they took him to the County Mental Health Hospital in Santa Cruz. Where they immediately lost him, and he turned up days later in the women's ward.\\"Jud Cost, Interview with Peter Lewis (1995) , sundazed.com; accessed December 31, 2015. Mental illness, drug addiction and alcoholism thus prevented Spence from sustaining a career in the music industry. Much of his life was spent in third party care, as a ward of the State of California, and either homeless or in transient accommodations in his later years. He remained in and around San Jose and Santa Cruz. Peter Lewis regularly visited Spence during the latter years of his life: \\"The last five years I'd go up‚Äö he lived in a trailer up there‚Äö Capitola. I used to hang around with him; we'd spend the weekends together. But he just basically kind of hit the...he was helpless in a way in terms of being able to define anything or control his feelings.\\"Doug Collette, Interview with Peter Lewis , Stateofmindmusic.com, July 2007; accessed December 31, 2015.

Spence's final performance with Moby Grape occurred on August 9, 1996 at Palookaville in Santa Cruz.

Founded in 1880, they were the oldest established football club in the Scottish Borders. The club was selected as a founder member of the Lowland Football League, which was formed in 2013 by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) as part of a proposed pyramid system. Their home ground was Yarrow Park. Following financial problems, they resigned from the Lowland League during the 2018‚Äì19 season and later went out of business due to insurmountable debts and failure to keep their SFA membership. HistoryThe Border pioneers (1880‚Äì1899)= History records that this initial meeting was a great success. A committee was formed and an opening game against Hibernian was arranged to launch the new venture.A Century of Soccer in Selkirk, 1880-1980 The kick-off was arranged for March 1881, the venue the cricket club, the result a 0‚Äì14 reverse, and so was born the oldest football club in the Borders. By 1882 Selkirk were recording good victories against leading Edinburgh clubs, Holyrood (8‚Äì2) and St Bernard's (4‚Äì1). Research indicates that by 1883 the club were fielding a second XI, competing in the Second XI Challenge Cup. The same year an extraordinary request was received by the club, Melrose Football Club (later Melrose RFC), invited seven players to represent Selkirk in a new kind of game‚Äîseven-a-side rugby. It was members of Selkirk Football Club in the absence of an organized rugby club that represented the town in the world premier of the shortened rugby game‚ÄîMelrose Sevens! A non-footballing honour also came the way of the club when member A. Stuart was appointed President of the East of Scotland Football Association. In 1890‚Äì91 a new trophy was instituted, the 'Association Borders Counties Challenge Cup' (Border Cup), which Selkirk won at the first time of asking, defeating Hawick Rangers, 4‚Äì3, in the final tie. A highlight of the 1891‚Äì92 season was a visit from Queen's Park, who at the time were one of the greatest club sides in the world. In front of a large crowd, Selkirk kept the score down to a respectable 4‚Äì1 defeat. Defeat by Vale of Gala in the defence of the Border Cup title was the first defeat by a Borders team for seven years. Season 1892‚Äì93 saw the club become a member of the Scottish Football Association and retain the Border Cup. In the seasons from 1894 to 1899, Selkirk won the Border Cup twice in succession, and were runners-up on two other occasions. The club also recorded their first Border League Championship in 1897, defeating Peebles Rovers 4‚Äì0 in a play-off. 1898 saw the team record an amazing 7‚Äì2 victory over Morton in the Scottish Qualifying Cup. Wull Brown a key player during this time became the first recorded player to sign for a league club (Heart of Midlothian). =Home at last (1900‚Äì1939)= Season 1903‚Äì04 saw the return of the Border Cup to Selkirk, although it took two replays to finally defeat Peebles Rovers at Victoria Park, Innerleithen. 1905-06 saw the team come close to winning its first honour from out with the Borders region, after a 3‚Äì1 reverse at the hands of Berwick Rangers in the final of the Consolation Cup. There was some real consolation however, when Selkirk were awarded once more the Border Cup. This time due to the non- appearance of Vale of Leithen come final day in Kelso. Almost of greater significance to matters on the field, Selkirk were able to outbid the let a local farmer offered with to graze sheep on part of the underhaugh by the River Ettrick. This led to the club having their first home after years of nomadic existence‚ÄîEttrick Park. After a period of consolidation due in part to the formation in 1907 of the rugby club in the town the football club won the Border League for the season 1909‚Äì10. 1914 saw a repeat of the 1906 Consolation Cup final, again with Berwick Rangers winning, this time 3‚Äì2. With the outbreak of the Great War, most competitive sporting activities were halted until 1918. 16 members of Selkirk Football Club made the supreme sacrifice and many more were to suffer from physical or psychological injuries. Sporting pursuits also took time to recover and forget. Season 1923‚Äì24 saw the first post war trophy paraded at Ettrick Park with a 2‚Äì1 victory over Civil Service Strollers in the Border Cup final. Later the same season, the Consolation Cup yet again eluded the 'Souters', this time losing out 2‚Äì1 to Coldstream, in front of 2,000 spectators. The 1920s brought hard times to the woollen trade in the town, and the club relied on the many friends it had made during the preceding years. Celtic, Hibernian and Queen of the South were all willing visitors to Ettrick Park, swelling the coffers and fending off what would be otherwise certain bankruptcy. It was during a visit by a Hearts XI that Bob Mercer died while leading his young charges in order to benefit his former club. A significant honour was bestowed in the club when former player James Fairgrieve was elected president of the East of Scotland Football Association from 1925‚Äì28. Season 1930‚Äì31 saw the return of the Border Cup, after defeating Coldstream 2‚Äì1 in the final. The club also managed a creditable 4‚Äì4 draw against a strong Hearts side with much to the Selkirk team's relief, legendary centre forward Barney Battles, Jr. acting as referee. Selkirk were able to retain the Border Cup at the climax of the 1931‚Äì32 season, defeating Berwick Rangers at Raidstane Park, Galashiels. By this time the game was booming in the town, with regular attendances of over 1,000 recorded. 1933 witnessed a famous Scottish Cup tie, with Selkirk defeating all-professional Bo'ness 3‚Äì0 courtesy of a 'spectacular' Jimmy Tranter hat- trick. The opening of a new pavilion at Ettrick Park was celebrated by the visit of Queen of the South in 1937. Season 1938‚Äì39 saw the Border Cup return once more to Selkirk, this time requiring a replay and extra time. Teenager Sandy Adamson scoring the winner in a 3‚Äì2 win over Penicuik Athletic. As the 1939‚Äì40 season kicked off, World War II broke out. A directive from the SFA immediately suspended all non-Army or junior competitive games heralding the end of another era in the club's history. =Superstars and World Cup opponents (1940‚Äì1969)= The end of the War did not initiate an immediate restart to footballing activities. Many players and members were not released from military service until some time after hostilities ended. Following a meeting in the Selkirk Institute in March 1946, a new committee was formed and planning for the future began. The playing staff suffered as a result of the war, significantly highly promising players Sandy Adamson was drowned on active service, and John Douglas was unable to play due to his war injuries. However, on a more positive note, many of the youth players had obtained great experience while playing for their Service teams. In addition, two young lads, Davie Grieve and Bobby Johnstone emerged from the Parkvale Rovers primed and ready for action. In October 1946, the newly revived Selkirk F.C. defeated Queen of the South on the Toll Field in front of 1,500 spectators. Unfortunately a major trophy eluded the team once more, this time losing to professional Gala Fairydean, 5‚Äì2, in the East of Scotland Cup final. This year also saw Bobby Johnstone and Eck Piercy sign for Hibernian. The transfer fee being the promise of a home friendly. This game duly took place in October 1947, Selkirk losing 11‚Äì2. Just before this, in September 1947, in the held- over East of Scotland Qualifying Cup final replay, Selkirk defeated Leith Athletic, 4‚Äì0, at Ettrick Park. A huge crowd turned out for the Wednesday night game and the final whistle brought great scenes of celebration, which were only slightly muted by the non-appearance of the cup. This was the first time an amateur team had taken the trophy out of Edinburgh. =The golden era (1970‚Äì1979)= The 1970s was definitely the epoch for the club, seeing 10 trophies arrive at Ettrick Park in the five seasons from 1973 to 1978. After dropping down to the amateur leagues in 1967, it was not until season 1971‚Äì72 that Selkirk would regain the confidence (and the finances) to return to senior football, and what a return it would be. The five years of glory commenced with the release of Ian Whitehead from Berwick Rangers in 1973, Chalky as he was universally known was snapped up by Selkirk and became player/manager later in the season. Whitehead became the architect of the most fruitful period of success in the club's history and soon bagged the first trophy in 28 years for Selkirk FC.

Throughout this period Selkirk had the services of many of the finest players in the Scottish Borders and frequently fielded four Amateur Scottish Caps in the side Ian Whitehead, Sandy Bell, Moray McLaren and Davie Watkins. December 1977 started on a remarkable note for Selkirk. As the support slowly filtered in to Ettrick Park for a league match against lowly Eyemouth United, the sharp shrill of the referee's whistle sounded the start of the game. Ian 'Chalky' Whitehead meanwhile had spotted the goalkeeper off his line in conversation with his centre-half. Brian 'the bear' McConnell kicked off for Selkirk and Chalky hammered the ball into the top corner of the net. Referee George Smith timed the goal at five-seconds, a second quicker than the then current record published by the Guinness Book of Records.\\"The fabulous Five Years\\": Souvenir Brochure edited by Keith Anderson for the 125th anniversary of Selkirk Football Club. Like all good things however, Selkirk's Golden Era came to an end when Ian Whitehead was enticed back into Scottish League Football as a coach with Second Division Berwick Rangers. Ian never concealed his desire to progress in management and possibly his greatest achievement was to manage the 'wee Gers' to the Championship title and to be promoted for the first time in their history. =Resurgence follows hard times (1980‚Äì1999)= The club have appeared in the Scottish Cup on numerous occasions, with their most infamous appearance having been in 1984/85, when they were beaten 20‚Äì0 by Stirling Albion. This is the biggest winning margin in British senior football during the 20th century. To compound the infamy the whole sorry match was recorded in full by the BBC for a documentary on the Scottish Cup. In truth the club were treading water at the time, they had dropped out of the East of Scotland League temporarily, and had to field a makeshift side of whoever they could find for the Scottish Cup match in order to maintain their qualification for the competition. The players took to the field in good spirits but were mercilessly exposed by their professional opponents. .Lothian keen to set the record straight for Selkirk's castaways Times Online, 19 November 2005. Accessed 9 April 2007 = East of Scotland = Selkirk won promotion to the East of Scotland Premier Division in season 2005‚Äì06 after some spirited performances, including a 6‚Äì1 win against local rivals Gala Fairydean.

Season 2007‚Äì08 resulted in relegation from the Premier Division, but they were reprieved when Annan Athletic left to fill the Third Division position vacated by the departing Gretna. Buoyed by this unexpected turn in fortunes, the club ended the campaign on a high by capturing their first silverware in 30 years, triumphantly lifting the Image Printers' Cup with a 3‚Äì1 victory over the much- fancied Lothian Thistle. Manager Fraser Lothian shocked the club shortly afterwards by leaving his post. It was confirmed that former Berwick Rangers player and local stalwart Paul 'Paulie' Brownlee would be taking over the managerial reins for the 2008‚Äì09 season.Brownlee takes over at Yarrow Park Selkirk Weekend Advertiser Online, 27 June 2008. Accessed 27 June 2008 Brownlee stuck to a policy of building a squad of predominantly local players. In season 2008‚Äì09, the team finished the campaign in 10th position. Towards the culmination of the fixture list, Selkirk had recorded unexpected home and away victories over the reigning league champions, Whitehill Welfare, to avoid the dreaded trapdoor and ensure that Premier Division football would be witnessed at Yarrow Park for another year. In season 2009‚Äì10, former chairman Roger Arnold and ex-player and manager of Selkirk Jackson Cockburn were awarded life-memberships of the club at a special lunch held at Yarrow Park. The club finish in 10th position in the Premier Division. In season 2010‚Äì11, the club received a SFA Standard Quality Award for services to grass roots football. Selkirk took the phrase 'down to the wire' to a new level in the last game of the season. After 14 games without a victory, results went for them in the other games and thanks to a Des Sutherland hat-trick, relegation was avoided at the final whistle with a 3‚Äì2 victory over Tynecastle. In season 2011‚Äì12, after six seasons of narrow squeaks and great escapes, Selkirk finally failed to remain in the Premier Division, ending the season last place in the table returning to the First Division. Selkirk started season 2012‚Äì13 well with excellent pre-season results, drawing with the Celtic and Hibernian under-20s sides and pushing Cowdenbeath to overturn a 0‚Äì2 deficit in the last 15 minutes of the game. However, despite this bright start the team ended up in the lower half of the league. As an initiative to develop players for the future, the club entered for the first time an under-19 team into the East of Scotland League Off the park the committee concentrated on meeting the new licensing requirement to allow the club entry into competitions like the Scottish Cup and the Lowland League. These efforts resulted in the funding (with the assistance of the Scottish Football Partnership) and installation of a new 100 seater stand and other ground improvements in order to qualify for SFA audit. = Lowland League and decline = Selkirk started season 2013‚Äì14 as a founding member of the Lowland Football League, leaving the East of Scotland League after an association stretching back to 1923. On 19 August 2013, Selkirk became the first Borders football club to be audited and meet the criteria to hold an SFA Licence. Following a defeat by Gretna 2008 on 12 October 2013, the ninth in a row, manager Mike McKinnon announced his resignation giving the club two weeks notice of his intentions. He was replaced within a week by Hutchison Vale under-21 squad manager and Hibernian youth coach Steve Forrest. The new manager came to Selkirk with a four-year plan, so it was unsurprising that a 1‚Äì0 backs-to-the wall win away to Whitehill Welfare and a 5‚Äì1 drubbing of local rivals, Gala Fairydean Rovers were the only on-field highlights for the rest of the term. A deal towards the end of the season was struck with EDUSport Academy to field some of their French nationals to provide match experience in Scotland. Yannis Lamghri, Benji Huteau, Jordane Orain and Julio Tonelle featured for the club in the second half of the season. The club started season 2014‚Äì15, its second season in the SLFL, with a successful pre-season, competing well, but ultimately losing to Stirling Albion and Falkirk before beating a Hibernian XI 3‚Äì1 and demolishing promising Junior Side Dalkeith Thistle 7‚Äì0. The biggest sensation however was the signing of ex-Hibernian, Birmingham City, Lokomotiv Moscow and Scotland national football team star, Garry O'Connor. Selkirk made national headlines again at the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season, this time with the signing of Scottish football's first ever poet in residence, Thomas Clark. Steve Forrest was sacked as Selkirk manager on 28 October 2015, Garry O'Connor took temporary charge. Following financial problems and having been fined for failing to fulfil two fixtures, Selkirk resigned from the Lowland League in August 2018.  Stadium  Yarrow Park, was the home of Selkirk F.C., opened in 2000 after Selkirk left their former ground, Ettrick Park. It has a capacity of 1,000 with 100 seats.Selkirk, nonleaguescotland.org.uk.

Grounds Ettrick Park Ground Developments 1906: A pavilion was erected at the entrance to the main gate, consisting of a large changing room for the home team, a much smaller one for the visitors and a 'doo-cot' for the match official. Light was provided by a paraffin lamp. Post match bathing was provided by bucket from the river Ettrick. Later a wooden open fronted 'press-box' was constructed on the embankment near to the main gate. This building had seating accommodation for three at a crush, and was subscribed on a first come, first save basis. 1937: The windowless 1906 pavilion was replaced with a new imposing structure providing spacious dressing room and committee accommodation. 1946: After war use, the park was completely levelled and re-turfed using voluntary labour supervised by groundsman Len Scott. Circa early 1970s: A small steel framed enclosure was constructed in front of the changing rooms over existing concrete terrace. 1975: New Pavilion/clubhouse constructed by converting and joining two surplus buildings purchased from the local education authority from Netherdale, Galashiels. The building was installed on the south side of the pitch opposite the old pavilion and stand. This was a task made simpler by having a secretary, Bert Ballantine, who was also a councillor, and player and future manager Moray McLaren who happened to be a chartered surveyor. 1978: A further extension described as a 'luxurious' lounge costing ¬£20,000 was opened by the then leader of the Liberal Party David Steel.

Formed in October 1953, the club plays its home games at Meadow Park and plays in the . History Threave spent their early years engaged in friendlies and local cup competitions until they became a senior club in 1959 and replaced Whithorn in the South of Scotland Football League. They played for many years in the South of Scotland League, winning the championship seven times, before moving to the East of Scotland Football League in 1998‚Äì99, (while simultaneously running a reserve team in the South of Scotland League). They performed well in the more difficult East of Scotland League, finishing third in the 2003‚Äì04 season, before quitting that league and deciding to concentrate their full efforts on the South of Scotland League. They cited the financial burden of constantly travelling eastwards to games as the reason for this decision. However, despite it being generally held that the South of Scotland League is the poorer of the two competitions, they only finished fourth in their first season back in the South, despite having finished third the season before in the East. This was primarily down to losing their top players to Annan Athletic and Dalbeattie Star, who did not want to play at a lesser level of football. In the 2007‚Äì08 Scottish Cup, they produced one of the biggest shocks when the club defeated Third Division side Stenhousemuir 1‚Äì0 in the second round.BBC Sport, Joy for Threave in Scottish Cup Their reward was a home tie with Raith Rovers in the third round, but Threave lost the game 0‚Äì5. Threave won the league in the 2008‚Äì09 season. The 2009‚Äì10 season proved to be another successful one for Threave, who retained the league title, losing only one match all season. On Saturday 23 October 2010, Threave progressed to the third round of the Scottish Cup with a 4‚Äì2 win against Edinburgh City at Meadowbank Stadium. The third round draw saw Rovers once again pitted against old foes Stenhousemuir, and despite leading 2‚Äì0 at Ochilview Park, they were pegged back to 2‚Äì2 at the final whistle. Threave subsequently lost the replay 1‚Äì5 at Meadow Park on Wednesday 12 January 2011 (originally scheduled for Saturday 27 November 2010, the third round replay was delayed for over six weeks following 15 weather-related postponements). The 2010‚Äì11 season proved as successful as the last two when Rovers defeated rivals Dalbeattie Star in front of 350 spectators at Islecroft in the penultimate game of the season to complete a hat-trick of league wins. The Castle Douglas side also lifted the Potts Cup after winning a penalty shoot- out 3‚Äì0 against Crichton at Hospital Park, they also won the Cree Lodge Cup after beating St Cuthbert Wanderers 5‚Äì1 in the final. As an early adopter of the SFA club licensing system, Threave were invited to become inaugural members of the Lowland Football League in 2013. Rovers found it difficult to compete at this level, finishing second bottom in their first season, then bottom in the two subsequent years. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, the club declined the opportunity to re-apply for membership of the Lowland League and rejoined the South of Scotland Football League. After a transitional season of finding their feet again back in the South of Scotland League, 2017‚Äì18 proved to be another memorable season, with the club gaining their 13th league title and winning two cups along the way. The team were managed since September 2018 by former player and team captain, Sam Warren. Warren left his position in March 2020 due to personal commitments and was replaced by former Rovers player, Vinnie Parker.

Written in the Christian era and essentially Christian in aspect, they preserve elements of Irish mythology. The immrama are identifiable by their focus on the exploits of the heroes during their search for the Otherworld, located in these cases in the islands far to the west of Ireland. The hero sets out on his voyage for the sake of adventure or to fulfill his destiny, and generally stops on other fantastic islands before reaching his destination. He may or may not be able to return home again. Definition The immrama are generally confused with a similar Irish genre, the echtrae or \\"adventure\\". Both types of story involve a hero's journey to an \\"otherworld\\", whether a Christian paradise, a fairyland, the land of the gods or a utopia. They are distinguished by date; echtrai are older, dating from the 7th century, while the earliest immram dates only to the 8th century. David Dumville argues that the immrama include more Christian thinking than the more pagan genre of echtrae, and that, whereas the purpose of the echtrai is to enhance understanding of the old gods and the land in which they live, in an immram these pagan elements occur as a challenge to the hero's faith. In an echtrae the protagonist only ever goes to one location and may arrive in the otherworld with no explanation of the journey, whereas in an immram the hero always has multiple adventures on several islands. Stories Originally there were seven officially recognised Immram listed in a list of ancient texts. Of those seven only three survive: The Voyage of Mael D√∫in, The Voyage of the U√≠ Chorra, and The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla. The Voyage of Bran is classified in these same lists as an echtrae, though it also contains the essential elements of the immrama. The later Latin Voyage of St. Brendan also contains a voyage across the sea to various otherworldly islands. Origins Immrama were first recorded as early as the 7th century by monks and scholars who fled Continental Europe before the barbarian invaders of the fifth century. These monks carried the learning of Western Europe and became the vanguard of the Christianizing of Europe. On this account it is expected that Immram have their origins in pre-existing Christian voyage literature, pre- existing Celtic legends, or classical stories the monks would have known. The origins of these stories are attributed to three sources of preexisting stories: Irish myths, Christian genres, and Classic Stories. The Otherworld in The Voyage of Bran is a distinctly Celtic feature but this is easily overlooked because the concept of the Christian paradise and the British and Irish otherworld are closely related. This difference is highlighted in the difference between sinless and sexless in the native and Christian mindset, like in the existing translation where an author may have turned the \\"Isle of Woman\\" into a chaste society, with some difficulty. Such an example was with a passage that described a man and a woman playing under a bush without sin or blame. This passage in light of several others emphasises a Christian effort to create a sinless and sexless Otherworld. Immrama may have borrowed heavily from preexisting Christian genres, such as the sanctae vitae (saints' lives), the Liturgy (pilgrimage stories), and the vision tales. As early as the 5th century Irish monks would go on a pilgrimage, a peregrination, sailing from island to island seeking isolation where they would meditate and purge themselves of their sins. The source of inspiration behind the Immram may also be the Christian punishment of sending people adrift for their crimes to be judged by God. Perhaps the largest piece of evidence that immram are Christian works is that the characters in the story are generally wandering priests, monks, and nuns, or at least related to them. One of the first Celticists, Heinrich Zimmerman, attempted to link the immram with the Aeneid and the Odyssey. Some of the parallels they make are between the immortal women in the tales who bestow immortality on their lovers for the time they remain with them and the giant sheep on islands in both stories. These parallels have since been debunked by William Flint Thrall. On top of their literary and mythological precedents, some scholars have argued that the immrama may be exaggerated retelling of historical voyages. The early Irish, particularly monks (see papar), were certainly far travelled, reaching the Orkney, Shetland, Faroe Islands at an early date and perhaps even reaching Iceland. Some places and things referenced in the immrama and the Brendan tale have been associated with real islands and real things, for instance Brendan's crystal pillar has been suggested to refer to an iceberg. InfluenceLiterature= *The Immrama have been proposed as part inspiration for both C. S. Lewis's The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and the poem Imram by contemporary J.R.R. Tolkien. *Australian author Patrick Holland's novel Navigatio is a 21st Century Immram that re-imagines the Brendan Voyage. It accretes contradictory and repetitive episodes to create the impression of an unredacted collection of medieval texts. *Anatole France satirised the Immram genre in the early part of his 1908 Penguin Island (French: L'√éle des Pingouins). =Other= The popularity of The Voyage of St. Brendan inspired Tim Severin to undertake a voyage using 5th century technology to demonstrate that the early Irish could have made it as far as North America.

The design of the ship started out in December 1926 as a seaplane carrier with room for twelve aircraft. When presented with the design, Sweden's Naval Construction Board decided that it wanted the ship to have cruiser and minelaying functions as well as operating as a seaplane carrier. The resulting 5,000-ton design presented in January 1927 proved impossible to build within the available budget of Sk16.5 million. The design was then reduced in size requiring one of the forward turrets be removed. Its guns were then placed in casemates either side of the superstructure, a feature otherwise found only in the American Omaha class cruisers. The construction contract for the ship was issued on 7 June 1930. Hawker Osprey S 9, ready for launch on HSwMS Gotland Its aircraft complement consisted of six Hawker Osprey seaplanes. It had capacity for eight and attempts were made to purchase two more, unsuccessfully since production of the type had ceased. The aircraft were found to suffer from wave damage during rough weather, often forcing the ship to return to port. During World War II Gotland sighted the German battleship Bismarck when it broke out of the Baltic Sea. The sighting was reported to Swedish Navy headquarters but the message was intercepted by the British embassy, which triggered the Battle of the Denmark Strait and the allied chase of the great battleship. HSwMS Gotland was converted in 1944 to an anti-aircraft cruiser due to a lack of modern seaplanes. This involved the removal of the seaplanes and the addition of four 40 mm Bofors guns and two 20mm L/70 guns. The Ospreys continued in service from harbour bases with the last being retired on 2 December 1947. After World War II she served as a training ship. Starting 1953 and finishing in 1954 she was modified to allow her to serve as a fighter direction ship in the event of war as well as a training ship in peacetime. She was decommissioned in 1956, struck off in 1960, sold in 1962 and finally scrapped in 1963.

On 31 December 1943, Sh≈çwa-shinzan began forming from rapid uplifting of a wheat field as a result of a sudden earthquake. This seismic event would eventually change into volcanic activity and result in the eruption of Mount Usu in 1944. A statue of Mimatsu at the base of Mount Utsu Due to the Japanese war effort, basic scientific materials were unavailable. However, Mimatsu, the postmaster of Sobetsu-cho, recorded measurements and drew diagrams of the rising mountain on paper. The story goes that in 1946, in order to study the volcano more thoroughly, he bought up the land using all of his savings and became owner of the volcano. A conflicting story described in Time on Monday, 4 July 1949http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888569,00.html indicates this purchase to be around 1944, and to have happened as a result of pressure from the villagers of Fukaba. Whatever the reasons, what Mimatsu gleaned from his \\"pet volcano\\" would be the basis for much understanding in years to come. Despite his amateur status, when he presented his data and sketches to the World Volcano Conference in Oslo in 1948, his work was praised by professional volcanologists. His papers were referred to as the \\"Mimatsu Diagram\\" (ja) and for them he received the First Hokkaido Cultural Award. In 1977, he was able to witness the third eruption of Mt. Usu in his lifetime. However, he died of illness on December 8 of the same year without being able to witness the end of the eruptive event.

Stem and leaf close-up Rhanterium epapposum is a plant of the family Asteraceae. Native to the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar where it is known locally as Arfaj (). The Arfaj plant consists of a complicated network of branches scattered with small thorny leaves and bright yellow flowers about 1.5 cm wide. The Arfaj flower is also the national flower of Kuwait. It is a bushy shrub approximately 80 cm height. The leaves are small and narrow, and in late spring it will start flowering (April‚ÄìMay). It is considered one of the main desert forage plants for camels and sheep. When cold temperature prevails the Rhanterium produces leaves quickly after rainfall. In a few months, the branches and newly formed leaves become vigorous, and the yellow flowers are produced, attracting insects and birds. In the summer, when the earth has dried out, the leaves fall and the branches become naked and lignified with living fibers. In times of stress, these alterations may be important in increasing the chance of survival, water and reserve material stored in the stems to remain alive by allowing it to have few dormant bud. When conditions improve, the reserves are transported into buds allowing new growth. Arfaj fruit is numerous; it forms in late spring and falls off the branches after maturity. It accumulates under the shrub and remains dormant until favorable conditions for germination prevail. Each fruit contains about 6-8 seeds that are transported by wind or water.

David Radler (born 1944 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian executive and close associate of Conrad Black for 36 years. Radler was once president of Ravelston Corporation, a privately owned corporation owned by Black and Radler to control their former newspaper empire. Ravelston owned Argus Corporation which in turn controlled Chicago-based Hollinger International. In 2005, 14.1% of Ravelston was owned by Radler. Career Radler graduated from Queen's University in 1967 with a master's degree in Business Administration.Siklos, Richard: Shades of Black: Conrad Black and the world's fastest growing press empire, Reed Books Canada, 1995, page 41. In the 1980s Radler was in charge of the sale of Argus Corporation's Dominion supermarket chain to The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, or A&P.; As well, Radler was once based in Chicago to help Black's media business‚Äîmanaged under Chicago-based Hollinger International) in the United States‚Äîas publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper and president and chief operating officer of Hollinger International. Controversy After buying up the London Daily Telegraph, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post, the Southam chain of Canadian newspapers and hundreds of small American newspapers, Hollinger International began to suffer from financial strain in the late 1990s. Radler and Black then sold off hundreds of their Canadian and American newspapers. Radler, who has lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, since the early 1970s, created a company called Horizon Publications Inc. This bought up some of the American newspapers owned by Hollinger International. After controversy developed in 2003‚Äì2004 concerning $32,000,000 of 'non-compete' payments made to Black and Radler in the sale of Hollinger newspapers, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (and Canadian authorities as well) announced that Black and Radler were under investigation for their involvement. Radler was eventually charged with five counts of mail fraud and two counts of wire fraud. On 20 September 2005, Radler pleaded guilty in a Chicago court to one count of mail fraud in relation to the 'non-compete' payments. These payments had been diverted by Radler to a company controlled by himself and Black, Horizon Publications Inc. By disguising the payments as 'non-compete' payments, non-sales proceeds, Radler took advantage of a Canadian tax ruling that made them tax-exempt. The prosecution argued that these moneys belonged to Hollinger International, and had been improperly and secretly diverted to Black and Radler. Radler was sentenced to a fine of $250,000 and a term of 29 months in prison. He had been assisting the prosecution in the investigation of his former business partner. Black is currently being tried on the many charges; his trial began in Chicago in March 2007. Patrick Fitzgerald is the lead prosecutor in the Black case, and Black is represented by a legal team which includes Toronto lawyer Edward Greenspan. In the fall of 2005, the Board of Trustees of Queen's University, Radler's alma mater, https://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/university-revise- philanthropic-and-service-naming-proceduresdirected that Mr. Radler‚Äôs name be immediately removed from the building wing of their business school that had been named after him, and his personal donation was returned. Subsequently, the university discovered that returning charitable gifts is impossible under Canada Revenue Agency regulations, which prevented the return of the donations from the various media companies. To make matters more complex, some of the companies themselves were no longer in operation, and others did not wish the gift returned in any case. While the board‚Äôs ethical decision was rightly lauded, the complexities of the gift, and the uncertainty about the rules at the time, created lingering confusion. After careful consideration and in consultation with Osprey Media (which now owned many of the companies that had made the original donations), it was agreed that in spirit Queen‚Äôs had returned the gift and Osprey had made an equivalent donation; Osprey is now recognized on the wall of the business school at the level of the donation. It was widely reported at the time that a Toronto hospital had no intention of returning Conrad Black's financial gift. This prompted some to question the wisdom of Queen's returning David Radler's generous donation. The business school, for its part, explained that the charge that Mr Radler had pleaded guilty to was \\"very serious\\" and not congruent with the values of the school and those it teaches. On 18 March 2007, it was reported that Mr. Radler had signed a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that will see him pay a penalty of almost US$29 million and prevent him from acting as an officer or director of any public company in the United States. The next day, it was announced that Mr. Radler has settled with the Sun-Times Media Group, agreeing to pay them $64.1 million. The news of the SEC settlement sparked protest from the defence at the Conrad Black trial; the defence claimed that such news would negatively influence the jury. Radler started serving his 29-month sentence for fraud on 25 February 2008 by reporting to Moshannon Valley Correctional Center in Pennsylvania. He was transfred to FCI Ray Brook in Upstate New York and was turned over to Canadian authorities on 18 September 2008. He was paroled from Ferndale Institution in Mission, British Columbia on 15 December 2008. He served only 10 months of a 29-month sentence. He was released on the grounds that he was unlikely to \\"commit an offence involving violence\\" before his sentence expired. The board said it was limited to considering only the matter of physical violence and could not consider the financial devastation caused by his crimes or the many victims of these crimes left in its wake.David Radler released on parole Mr. Radler is now back at work in his office in Vancouver running his business, the Alberta Newspaper Group.

Samsaris, Historical Geography of Eastern Macedonia during the Antiquity (in Greek), Thessaloniki 1976 (Society for Macedonian Studies).. was officially established in 146 BC, after the Roman general Quintus Caecilius Metellus defeated Andriscus of Macedon, the last self-styled king of the ancient kingdom of Macedonia in 148 BC, and after the four client republics (the \\"tetrarchy\\") established by Rome in the region were dissolved. The province incorporated the former kingdom of Macedonia with the addition of Epirus, Thessaly, and parts of Illyria, Paeonia and Thrace. This created a much larger administrative area, to which the name of 'Macedonia' was still applied. DescriptionOrganization= After the reforms of Diocletian in the late 3rd century, Epirus Vetus was split off, and sometime in the 4th century, the province of Macedonia itself was divided into Macedonia Prima in the south and Macedonia Secunda or Salutaris in the north. These provinces were all subordinate to the Diocese of Macedonia, one of three dioceses comprising the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum. When the Prefecture was divided between the Western and Eastern Empires in 379, the Macedonian provinces were included in Eastern Illyricum. With the permanent division of the Empire in 395, Macedonia passed to the East, which would evolve into the Byzantine Empire. The Dardanians, to the north of the Paeonians, were not included in the Roman province of Macedonia, and they initially had supported the Romans in their conquest of Macedonia, but later felt into confrontation with Rome.\\"With the arrival of the Romans in the territory of Illyricum in 200 B.C., the Dardani took the side of the (Roman) Republic and signiÔ¨Åcantly strengthened their positions against Macedonia by occupying the area of Paeonia. However, after the defeat of Perseus in 168 B.C., and especially from 148 B.C., when Macedonia ceased to be independent and fell under Roman rule, the Dardani, left without constant raids against their southern neighbor, now entered into confrontation with Rome. The Roman occupation and annexation of Dardania was not carried out in a short time ‚Äì it was a process unfolding through several war conÔ¨Çicts and, I would say, with certain reluctance.\\" For more see: Vladimir P. (2006). \\"Pre-roman and Roman Dardania historical and geographical considerations\\". Balcanica (37): 7‚Äì23. =Achaea= Achaea or Achaia was initially part of the Roman Province of Macedonia (from 146 to 27 BC). It later became a separate Province by the Augustan Settlement of 27 BC, which established the Roman Empire. =Epirus Vetus= The Roman provinces of Epirus Vetus and Epirus nova in relation to modern borders. Epirus, later Epirus Vetus (\\"Old Epirus\\"; ), was a province in the Roman Empire that corresponded to the region of Epirus. Between 146 BC and 27 BC, it was part of the province of Macedonia, after which it became part of Achaea, before becoming a separate province under Emperor Trajan. =Epirus Nova= Epirus Nova (\\"New Epirus\\", ) or Illyria GraecaThe Loeb Editor's Notes, 28 Nova Epirus or Illyris GraecaA new classical dictionary of Greek and Roman biography, mythology, and geography: partly based upon the Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology by Sir William Smith,1851, page 392Catholic Encyclopedia - Durazzo or Illyris proper was a province of the Roman Empire established by Diocletian during his restructuring of provincial boundaries. Until then, the province belonged to the province of Macedonia.Handbook of Ancient Geography and History by Ptz Wilhelm, , The (734) southern portion, or Illyria Graeca, belonged to the province of Macedonia.Atlas of Classical History by R.

But there is evidence that Constantine considered ...\\" Dyrrachium (or Epidamnus) was established as the capital of Epirus Nova.Hendry, p. 299. The geography is entirely correct for Servius' time, since Diocletian's rearrangement of provincial boundaries included the creation of the province of Epirus Nova out of southern Illyricum with Dyrrachium (=Epidamnus) as its capital. The region of Epirus Nova correspondedWilkes, J. J.

The province mostly coincides with the present-day North Macedonia. The town of Stobi located to the junction of the Crna Reka and Vardar (called in Greek Axios) rivers, which was the former capital of Paeonia, arose later in the capital city of Macedonia Salutaris. =Thessalia= This province was encompassing the area of ancient Thessaly, which was right in the south of ancient Macedonia. Also herein are being mentioned the subdivisions of Thessalia Prima and Thessalia Secunda. =Economy= A tetradrachm of Thasos from Roman controlled Macedonia. It was minted between 148 and 80 BC. Obverse shows Dionysos and reverse shows Herakles. The reign of Augustus ( 27 BC14 AD ) began a long period of peace, prosperity and wealth for Macedonia, although its importance in the economic standing of the Roman world diminished when compared to its neighbor, Asia Minor. The economy was greatly stimulated by the construction of the Via Egnatia during 130s and 120s BC, the installation of Roman merchants in the cities, and the founding of Roman colonies. The Imperial government brought, along with its roads and administrative system, an economic boom, which benefited both the Roman ruling class and the lower classes. With vast arable and rich pastures, the great ruling families amassed huge fortunes in the society based on slave labor. The Roman empire under Hadrian (ruled 117-38), showing the senatorial province of Macedonia' in southeastern Europe The improvement of the living conditions of the productive classes brought about an increase in the number artisans and craftspeople to the region. Stonemasons, miners, blacksmiths, etc. were employed in every kind of commercial activity and craft. Greek people were also widely employed as tutors, educators and doctors throughout the Roman world. The export economy was based essentially on agriculture and livestock, while iron, copper, and gold along with such products as timber, resin, pitch, hemp, flax, and fish were also exported. Another source of wealth was the kingdom's ports, such as Dion, Pella, Thessalonica, Cassandreia.Macedonia - Province of the Roman Empire  List of Roman governors  Republican = * Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus (147 BC); * Gnaeus Egnatius (146/145 BC); * Lucius Julius Caesar (93/92 BC); * Gnaeus Cornelius Dolabella (80‚Äî78 BC); * Appius Claudius Pulcher (78‚Äî76 BC); * Gaius Scribonius Curio Burbulieus (75/74 BC); * Lucius Manlius Torquatus (64/63 BC); * Gaius Antonius Hybrida (62/61 BC); * Gaius Octavius (60/59 BC); * Lucius Appuleius (c. 58 BC); * Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (57‚Äî55 BC); * Quintus Ancharius (c. 54 BC); * Titus Antistius (50 BC); * Marcus Favonius propraetor (?)

Taxonomy Grace's warbler was discovered by Elliott Coues in the Rocky Mountains in 1864. He requested that the new species be named after his 18-year-old sister, Grace Darling Coues, and his request was honored when Spencer Fullerton Baird described the species scientifically in 1865. Description Grace's warbler is a small bird, 11‚Äì13 cm long. It is mostly gray on top, with broken black streaks across the back and flanks and two white bars on the wings. The throat and breast are a vibrant yellow, and the rest of the underparts are white. It has a yellow half-eye ring under the eye and a long yellow \\"eyebrow\\" stripe that starts at the base of the beak and runs above the eye, fading to white after it passes the eye. Distribution and habitat Grace's warblers breed from the south- western United States to Nicaragua and winter in their breeding range from north-eastern Sinaloa and north-western Durango south. They are almost always found in pine forests, even in migration, though at the northern end of their range (in southern Nevada and Utah and southwestern Colorado) they occur in spruce-fir forest. They prefer open, \\"parklike\\" woods, and in some areas such as northern Arizona they prefer an understory of Gambel's oak. In the United States and northern Mexico they typically occur at altitudes of ); farther south they may occur as low as 250 m. They are common in some localities, and in areas of the Mosquitia of Nicaragua where the only tree is the Caribbean pine, Grace's warblers may be the only bird seen.Stacier, Cynthia A.; Guzy, Michael J. 2002. Grace's Warbler (Setophaga graciae), The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Accessed 2012-03-1 Behaviour and ecologyBreeding= The nesting habits of Grace's warblers are largely unknown, as nests are very rarely found. The nest is a compact cup of plant fibers, the inside lined with hair and feathers, placed high above ground on a tree branch, usually pine. The female lays 3 to 5 white or cream-colored eggs, speckled with brown, and ringed at the larger end. =Feeding= Like the vast majority of warblers, Grace's warbler eats only insects and spiders, as far as is known from limited studies. It forages mostly high in pine trees (86% of its foraging time in a study in Arizona was in pines, but it foraged in oaks more in Mexico where olive warblers also occur). It catches its food from the bases of needle clusters and the upper bark of branches no thicker than its body. It will often hover to inspect pine cones for insect larvae. In Arizona it seldom flies to catch insects, but in Nicaragua it often does.

He was one of Australia‚Äôs most important artists, and one of the twentieth century's major landscapists. He had more than seventy solo exhibitions during his career in Australian galleries, as well as the exhibition Fred Williams - Landscapes of a Continent at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1977. Early life and education Fred Williams was born on 23 January 1927 in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia,Mollison (p. 3.) the son of an electrical engineer and a Richmond housewife. Williams left school at 14 and was apprenticed to a firm of Melbourne shopfitters and box makers. From 1943 to 1947 he studied at the National Gallery School, Melbourne, at first part-time and then full-time from 1945 at the age of 18. The Gallery School was traditional and academic, with a long and prestigious history. He also began lessons under George Bell the following year, who had his own art school in Melbourne. This continued until 1950. Bell was a conservative modern artist but a very influential teacher. Between 1951 and 1956, Williams studied part-time at the Chelsea School of Art, London (now Chelsea College of Art and Design) and in 1954 he did an etching course at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. He lived in a South Kensington bedsit and subsidised his art practice by working part-time at Savage‚Äôs picture framers. Williams returned to Melbourne in 1956, when his family was able to send him a cheap ticket aboard a ship bringing visitors to the Melbourne Olympics. He had work included in the 'Recent Australian Painting' exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, and 'Australian Painting: Colonial, Impressionism, Modern' at the Tate Gallery.  Work  After mainly working with figures in early paintings and etchings, he began painting landscapes after returning to Melbourne in 1957, which remained the major theme in his art. While learning etching and printing in London, he produced vivid caricatured sketches of contemporary London life. It was during this period that he established his method of reworking the same motif a number of times in a number of mediums and very often over a number of years. As an artist concerned with form over subjectivity, Williams' approach struck a jarring note against the unity of many of his close associates such as John Brack, Arthur Boyd and Charles Blackman, the authors of the famous ‚ÄòAntipodean‚Äô manifesto of 1959. Williams' work was excluded from their major exhibition. As heirs to the expressionist tradition, the Antipodeans lauded a spontaneous, improvised approach to painting and saw the function of art as vested in its expressive potential. They had little time for - and, in fact, denounced - the 'new' art emerging from Europe, the influences which were increasingly informing Williams' development. On his return to Australia, Williams saw the aesthetic potential of the Australian bush in its inherent plasticity. His interest in finding an aesthetic 'language' with which to express the very un- European Australian landscape. This was grounded in establishing a pictorial equivalent to the overwhelmingly vast, primarily flat landscape, in which the traditional European relationship of foreground to background breaks down, necessitating a complete re-imagining of compositional space. In this, Williams looked to the approach taken by Australian Aboriginal artists. He did this by tilting the landscape up against the picture plane, so that frequently the only indicator of horizontal recession is the presence of a horizon line, or where clumps of trees huddle closer together towards the horizon, suggesting recession. Where no horizon is visible, the landscape runs fully parallel to the picture plane, as in the major You Yangs series of the mid-1960s. Here, calligraphic knots of pigment indicate the presence of single trees against the earth, as if seen from the air (example). Williams' first Australian landscape series was based on the Nattai River (1957‚Äì58). Williams' landscapes recorded the passage of the Yarra River from its source to its mouth. In 1960, Williams was invited to enter for the Helena Rubenstein Travelling Art Scholarship, the richest and most prestigious art prize at the time with an award of ¬£1000 plus ¬£300 travel expenses aimed at giving the winner overseas experience.Mollison (p. 48.) Five paintings were required for his entry and he selected Landscape with a steep road (1957), Landscape with a building I (c. 1957‚Äì58), The forest pond (c. 1959‚Äì60), Sherbrooke Forest (1960) and The St George River (1960). He won in 1963 and it proved to be a turning point in his career which, according to fellow artist Jan Senbergs, brought Williams wide acclaim, especially from many influential curators and critics. Sydney art dealer Rudy Komon took Williams on as one of his key artists which enabled Williams to discontinue his part-time work with a Melbourne picture-framer and paint full-time. In 1969, Williams started using a horizontal strip format in his landscape paintings in order to present different aspects of one scene on the same sheet. In 1970, Williams produced a group of four large strip format gouache-on-paper paintings called the West Gate Bridge series showing the half-constructed West Gate Bridge over the Yarra River in Melbourne. A section of the bridge collapsed on 15 October 1970, while it was still under construction, killing thirty-five workers. Williams had planned to paint the length of the river, but his widow, Lyn said he \\"lost heart in the project\\" after the accident. In his Beachscape with bathers Queenscliff I-IV series from 1971, Williams painted from the top of a cliff overlooking the beach during a seaside holiday. Each sheet is broken horizontally into four separate strips representing a different time of day and corresponding shift in the colour and tone of the scene as Williams recorded the effects of light on the landscape. By 1971 he had developed the technique extensively, moving from a vertical format to a horizontal format. In March 1974, Williams travelled to Erith Island in Bass Strait with the historians Stephen Murray-Smith and Ian Turner, and fellow painter Clifton Pugh. Poor weather prevented Williams and his friends from leaving the island when they had intended. When the weather broke Williams painted a number of gouaches, including Beachscape, Erith Island I and II which employ the horizontal strip format. The Beachscape, Erith Island pictures show the point where the sea joins the land depicted as if looking down from above in the form of four strips. Williams recorded the event in his diary from 27‚Äì28 March 1974, \\"I do 'strip' paintings of the beach using sand glued on ‚Äì but the wind has worn me to a 'frazzle' ‚Ä¶ My final half doz. strip paintings are my best.\\" In May 1976, while Williams and his wife Lyn were visiting Paris and Bologna, many of Williams's paintings and all gouaches stored at the Barrett Malt Factory in Richmond were damaged by a fire. In 1976, Williams flew over the Northern Territory at night on his way to an art fair in Bologna, Italy. He saw lines of bushfires burning and later that year produced the twelve-sheeted gouache series, Bushfire in Northern Territory. In February 1979, Williams visited the Lal Lal Falls on the Moorabool River to the west of Melbourne near Ballarat and painted the Lal Lal polyptych, a four panel painting that he regarded as a single work.Mollison (p. 224.) The successive canvases of the polyptych depict the changes in light on the waterfall and the surrounding landscape. Williams painted the last of his major landscapes, the four panel Waterfall polyptych (oil on canvas, each 183.0 cm x 152.5 cm), in his studio in 1979 based on the Lal Lal polyptych. He described the studio painting as \\"a major effort on my part\\" and it is regarded as one of the most important works of his career. Williams said that his \\"enthusiasm was fired\\" by Eugene von Gu√©rard's Waterfall, Strath Creek from 1862. In the last years of his career, Williams produced more landscape series with strong themes, his last being the Pilbara series (1979‚Äì81), which remained intact as it was acquired by Con-Zinc Rio Tinto Group, the mining company that had invited him to explore the arid north-west region of Australia Awards Williams received a Helena Rubinstein Travelling Art Scholarship in 1963. In 1976 he was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and awarded a Doctorate of Law (Honoris Causa) by Monash University in 1980. Williams won the Wynne Prize for landscape painting twice; in 1966 with Upwey Landscape and in 1976 with Mt. Kosciusko. His painting Upwey Landscape (1965) sold for $1,987,700 in one of the final auctions of Christie's in Australia in April 2006, which at the time was the second highest price for any work sold at an Australian auction.Art Insight May, andrewmcilroy.com.

Personal life Williams met Lyn Watson in January 1960 while painting at Sherbrooke. They were married in March 1961 and moved to the inner-city suburb of South Yarra.Mollison (p. 61.) They had three daughters: Isobel, Louise and Kate. In 1963 the couple moved to Upwey, Victoria in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, a location that would have a decisive impact on his work. In 1964 they travelled through Europe on a Helena Rubenstein Scholarship. In 1969 Williams moved to Hawthorn, an inner suburb of Melbourne. Death and legacy In November 1981, Williams was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.Mollison (p. 237.) He died less than six months later in Hawthorn on 22 April 1982, aged 55. Fellow artist and friend John Brack gave the eulogy at his funeral. He said Williams' estate Williams' estate is managed by his widow, Lyn Williams. Lyn bought a former factory in inner- Melbourne in 1989 and has managed the artist's estate from there since she sorted through his studio at their former home in Hawthorn. All of the artist's known works have been catalogued on a database. The building houses Williams' easel, brushes, the leather-bound diaries he kept from 1963 until his death, clipping books, a range of works and includes a gallery for hanging and photographing the artist's works. Works that are donated to public galleries and museums are prepared there. In 2009, Lyn Williams completed her ongoing gift to the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) of the prints of Fred Williams.

The headframe is the light-colored building in the center, unusual in that it is built of concrete. The dome-shaped building to the left is an ore storage facility. The Hollinger Gold Mine was discovered October 9, 1909, by Benny Hollinger, who found the gold-bearing quartz dike that later became known as Hollinger Mines. With his friend, professional prospector, Alex Gillies; Hollinger had travelled to the Porcupine region, in the wake of the Wilson expedition, which had recently discovered the future Dome Mine site. Hollinger and Gillies staked three claims each, and one for their former partner, Bernard \\"Barney\\" P. McEnaney, who had been unable to join them due to severe sciatica.Bachman, Karen The Daily Press, \\"Mines focal point of local industrial history\\", October 20, 2017. Retrieved November 2, 2017.] Hollinger sold his claim to a small syndicate led by Noah Timmins that, in 1910, incorporated as Hollinger Mines in Timmins, Ontario. The five venture partners were brothers Noah and Henry Timmins; brothers Duncan and John McMartin; and Mattawa, Ontario attorney (1863 - 1924), for whom the David Dunlap Observatory was named. The main Hollinger Mine operated from 1910 until 1968. During that period 65,778,234 tons were milled, producing 19,327,691 ounces of gold, indicating an overall grade of 0.29. The value of the gold produced is placed at $564.7 million. Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines was later acquired by Canadian tycoon E. P. Taylor's Argus Corporation. Argus was later acquired by Conrad Black in 1978 and it would become today's Hollinger Incorporated. * Founded 1910 as Hollinger Gold Mine * Changed to Hollinger Mines * Changed to Hollinger Argus Limited 1978 * Changed to Hollinger Inc. in 1985 Hollinger Mine Hollinger Mine shaft, early 1900s Rumors of gold in the Porcupine area had been circulating for some time, but every attempt to start production had resulted in poor returns. In June 1909 a group of prospectors found a rich vein that would eventually become the Dome Mine, but at the time it too remained undeveloped. However the news was now out, and prospectors started flowing into the area, resulting in the Porcupine Gold Rush. In 1909 Benny Hollinger, a young barber from Haileybury, and his partner, Alex Gillies, started prospecting in the area. When they met the Wilson expedition they were told that all the good lots were staked for at least west. So they went west, past the already staked-out claims, until they came upon an abandoned test pit near Pearl Lake where Reuben D'Aigle had given up three years earlier. The two were exploring the site when Hollinger dug into a mound that demonstrated how unlucky D'Aigle was: > ... Benny was pulling moss off the rocks a few feet away, when suddenly he > let a roar out of him and threw his hat to me. At first I thought that he > was crazy but when I came over to where he was it was not hard to find the > reason. The quartz where he had taken off the moss looked as though someone > had dripped a candle along it, but instead of wax it was gold. They staked twelve claims near their discovery. Because different sponsors had staked them, they flipped a coin to determine how to divide them. Hollinger won the toss and took the higher ground. Noah Timmins, who had been successful with the La Rose silver mine in Cobalt during the Cobalt Silver Rush, purchased an option on Hollinger's claims and immediately started work on setting up mining operations. He set out in the Fall of 1909 from mile post 222 on the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO;) with a crew of twenty-eight men, two teams of horses, and two tons of supplies. Following an old lumber road, they had to blaze their own trail where the road had become overgrown. They arrived at the mine site on New Year's Day, 1910. Soon, Timmins had acquired 560 acres, which included the Hollinger, Miller, Gillies, Millerton, and Acme Gold claims. The Hollinger was incorporated and the Timmins group formed Canadian Mining and Finance Company Limited. In May 1911, the surface plant was lost to fire. Then the July 1911 Porcupine Fire devastated the area. However, the torrential rains afterwards exposed more quartz veins. By 1914, the mill was producing 800 tons a day from 54 veins. Electric locomotives were introduced in 1916. Eventually, Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines encompassed 440 acres. By the end of the 1920s the Hollinger was the largest gold mine in the British Empire and paid annual dividends of more than $5 million. By 1927, a 3.5 mile aerial tramway was in operation. In the 1930s Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines built 250 houses which were located in one area of the Town of Timmins. These houses remained in place right up until the late 1970s. The three room homes were designed and built identical to each other in every respect with the exception of the impregnated tar paper the covered them. Every second home was green with a red roof and the other was red with a green roof. By 1945, the mine had 350 miles of underground railway, used by 36 electric locomotives, and 1,500 ore cars. The mine was so big that by the 1960s it had almost of tunnels. Fire Porcupine Mine Rescue Station On February 10, 1928 smoke began to curl up from the main shaft house. At first no one could understand how fire could take place in a hard-rock mine. The Hollinger had its own safety inspector, in addition to the government official, but they had not visited all of the more than of underground workings. Hundreds of miners escaped to surface, but the news soon spread that others had been trapped on the level. At that time mined-out stopes were not backfilled with waste rock, but one on the level had been filled over the years with mining debris such as powder boxes, sawdust and wooden crates. It's believed that the fire started as a result of spontaneous combustion in this area. There were accounts of individual heroism, and the Department of Mines, the T&NO;, many others, and the community itself put forth a stellar effort to battle the disaster and alleviate the suffering. A relief train was sent up from Pennsylvania with rescue personnel experienced in coal-mine fires. In the end, 39 miners succumbed to the smoke and carbon monoxide poisoning. An inquiry into the disaster recommended that mine rescue stations be set up in major mining camps. In 1929 the Porcupine Camp received the first mine rescue station in the province. Stompin' Tom Connors, the famous Canadian musician, composed and recorded a ballad about another later fire at the nearby McIntyre Mines (in February 1965), with Lord Thomson's \\"CKGB Recording\\" entitled \\"Fire in the Mine\\". Current Ownership/Activity The mine shut down in 1968, but was reactivated in the seventies as an open-pit mine. The mine site was acquired in December 1999 by Kinross Gold prior to the bankruptcy of Royal Oak Mines. Most of the work on the site has concerned the management of ground subsidence resulting from the collapse of drifts and stopes that were not backfilled. Extensive subsidence has occurred at the Hollinger Golf Course to the southwest of the mine site. The Hollinger mine site property was purchased by Goldcorp in 2016, and became an active open-pit mine.CBC Sudbury AMEC Earth & Environmental Goldcorp Hollinger Mine Closure Plan, a Division of AMEC Americas Limited, December 2010.

Located within Dungog Shire it is situated on the Paterson River. It is in the middle of what was once dairy, timber and citrus country and is now more significantly a feeder town for the nearby mining industry in the Upper Hunter and the city of Newcastle It was named after one of the first known Europeans in the area was Colonel William Paterson in 1801 surveyed the area beside the river.  Geography  It is approximately 15 minutes drive north along either Tocal or Paterson Roads from the nearest major township of Maitland. The Paterson railway station lies on the main North Coast Railway Line between Sydney and Brisbane with daily services north to Dungog and south-east to Newcastle. Adjoining areas include Duns Creek, Martins Creek and Vacy. History The area was once occupied by the Wonnarua and Worimi peoples, who are Aboriginal Australian groups. The first official European in the area was the man whose name the town was to adopt, Colonel William Paterson, who, in 1801, surveyed the area beside the river that Governor King named in his honour. As with so many colonial settlements, timbercutters, after local supplies of red cedar, followed in the footsteps of the explorers and surveyors. Indeed, the Hunter River, into which the Paterson River flows, was then known as the Cedar Arm due to the abundance of timber. =Early settlement of Patersons Plains= In 1812, four convicts (Swan, Pell, Davis and Swan) and John Tucker jnr were permitted by Governor Macquarie to commence farming on the Paterson River at \\"Patersons Plains\\", a location that came to be known as \\"Old Banks\\", as a special reward for supplying the Government with 500 cedar logs.Walsh, Brian \\"European Settlement at Paterson River 1812 to 1822\\", Paterson Historical Society, 2012 Old Banks, in an area first surveyed by Henry Dangar in 1822-23, was the true genesis of rural settlement outside of the Sydney basin. It grew to eight farms along the river by 1818, six of them belonging to convicts. This fledgling farming community subsisted under the oversight of the locality's military station and lock-up established at the river's crossing point. Commandant Morrisett established (c.1818) the first Magistrate's Court above Newcastle in his Commandant's Cottage that he constructed at Old Banks on the farm of Pell (d.1815). Old Banks near Paterson viewing North West toward Tocal. Davis, Pell and Swan farmed the far bank of the river while Tucker farmed the nearside. However, from the early 1820s, the prominence of Old Banks as the Government's primary frontier seat of Government, and the 'original' Paterson, waned as a consequence of the establishment (from c.1818) and prolific growth of the Government's rural settlement and township at Wallis Plains (now East Maitland) ten kilometres to the south. With the construction of an overland route direct to north-western Sydney in 1823, Wallis Plains and the deep river port of Morpeth became the centre of the Lower Hunter Valley's connections with Sydney and the penal settlement at Newcastle. Even so, the military outpost at Old Banks (along with a similar facility 14 kilometres to the east at Seaham on the Williams River) continued to provide for the interception of escaped convicts from Port Macquarie, the imposition of law and order for the Paterson region and the oversight of a most important centre for transportation of goods, chattels and people. The first land grant in the area was made to Captain William Dunn in 1821 on land a few kilometres to the north of Old Banks. In 1822, when the area was formally opened up to settlement, James Webber established \\"Tocal\\" on his land grant immediately to the north-west of Swan's farm; Tocal to become among the most successful of the farming establishments on the lower Paterson River. In 1823, Morrisett's Government Cottage and associated infrastructure was made available to Timothy Nowlan as the base for his Government-sponsored sheep breeding 'experiment', and family home. A one-mile square area situated to the west of the river at Old Banks (and about 800m distant from the river and to the south of Tocal) was identified as a possible township by the early 1830s. However this was not developed in favour of the present township site. =Present township of Paterson= The present township of Paterson, situated six kilometres to the north of the original military station at Old Banks, was the third to be surveyed in the Hunter Valley after Newcastle and Maitland, but was not proclaimed until 1833. With the continuing settlement of the district, Paterson soon became an important tidal river port and service centre to the surrounding community. Many early settlers were Scots and hence a Presbyterian Church preceded an Anglican establishment. Indeed, St Ann's, opened in 1842, is said to be the oldest Presbyterian Church on mainland Australia. The river trade began to decline in the 1850s as the road to Maitland improved. Timber mills were established by the 1870s. In its heyday Paterson had four stores, five hotels, two shipyards, a sawmill, a tannery, four blacksmiths, two butchers, a bakery and a boarding school for girls. Shipbuilding also commenced with the development of the river trade and considerable supplies of tobacco were grown, as well as grains, grapes, wine, citrus fruits and cotton were transported by steamboats to Morpeth, Newcastle and Sydney. Viewing south to Paterson village. The rising ground to left and right forms the mouth of the Paterson Valley By the time the railway arrived in 1911 the long-term decline of river transportation had taken its toll. With ironic symbolism the railway line passed directly over the wharf and a mishap during the construction of the railway bridge in 1909 sunk one of the local boats, the Anna Maria, which had been contracted to carry the BHP made girders. The boat was salvaged but was nearly destroyed again when a spark from a steam train set it ablaze. The last steam boats visited the area in the 1930s. Throughout the 20th century agriculture has been the major source of local income. Citrus production was particularly strong at the turn of the century, with an estimated 30,000 cases being handled at the port each year. At the 2006 census, Paterson had a population of 345 people.

She was built as a commercial fishing vessel, and used in that capacity for more than sixty years. She now serves as the maritime goodwill ambassador for the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the Ports of Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. She has been featured in a number of films, and participated in domestic and international events, including OpSail 2000. History The barquentine Gazela Primeiro (meaning Gazelle the First in Portuguese) was built in the shipyard of J. M. Mendes in Set√∫bal, Portugal in 1883. At that time the Portuguese fisheries authorities had a regulation prohibiting the construction of new vessels for the Grand Banks cod fishery. It was however permissible to modify or \\"rebuild\\" an existing vessel. The best information available indicates that the registration of a much smaller, two-masted vessel built in Cacilhas in 1883, named Gazella (spelled with two Ls), was transferred by the owners to the newly built vessel in 1901. There is no evidence that any timbers from the earlier vessel were re-used in the construction of the later one; a practice which would make no sense to a commercial wooden shipbuilder in the 1900s. Gazela was built to carry fishermen to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Every spring she would leave Lisbon, laden with as many as 35 dories stacked on deck like drinking cups, a crew of 40 men (35 fishermen/sailors, two cooks, two mates and the captain), and a couple of apprentices. Her cargo hold would be full of salt as ballast. The salt would be used for the fish that were caught (cod, flounder, halibut, haddock and perch), preserving them for the long trip home. Gazela could stow upwards of 350 tons of salted fish in her holds. Gazela was engine-less until 1938, when a Mannheim-Benz diesel engine was installed. With the depletion of cod on the Grand Banks, vessels were being forced to fish the Davis Strait, between Greenland and Baffin Island, Canada. The contrary winds and frequent icebergs in this area made life difficult for ships without engines. To accommodate the propeller, a new rudder post was installed and her counter was extended approximately 10‚Äì12 feet, giving her a long overhanging transom. After a remarkably long commercial career, Gazelas last voyage to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland as a commercial fishing ship was made in 1969. Philadelphia About the time Gazela was laid-up after her final voyage to the Banks, the Philadelphia Maritime Museum was searching for an historic sailing vessel. Word reached Gazelas owners and the following year, she was purchased for the museum by philanthropist William Wikoff Smith. On May 24, 1971, with a crew of Americans (including one former Gazela engineer), the ship left for its new home in Philadelphia, tracing Columbus' route via the Canary Islands and San Juan, Puerto Rico and on Thursday, July 8, made her first entrance into Philadelphia. In 1985, Gazela was transferred to the Philadelphia Ship Preservation Guild, the not-for-profit corporation that now maintains and operates the vessel with the help of donors and volunteers, sending her as Philadelphia's tall ship to events up and down the eastern seaboard of the U.S. Gazela spends the spring and summer months cruising the Delaware River and the Atlantic Coast. In the winter months Gazela is maintained by volunteer members of the Philadelphia Ship Preservation Guild.

Ballistic nylon was developed by the DuPont corporation as a material for flak jackets to be worn by World War II airmen. The term ballistic nylon originates in the fabric's intended function, protecting its wearers from flying debris and fragmentation caused by bullet and artillery-shell impacts.  Description  The original specification for ballistic nylon was an 18 ounce nylon fabric made from 1050 denier high tenacity nylon yarn in a 2√ó2 basketweave. Today the term is often used to refer to any nylon fabric that is made with a \\"ballistic weave\\", typically a 2√ó2 or 2√ó3 basketweave. It can be woven from nylon yarns of various denier such as 840 denier and 1680 denier.  Origin  Ballistic nylon was originally developed by the Dupont corporation for flak jackets for World War II airmen. The name of this nylon speaks to its origin; its intent was to protect the airmen from flying debris and fragmentation caused by bullet and artillery-shell impacts. The nylon type was not effective against most pistol and rifle bullets, let alone the heavy 20 mm and 30 mm autocannons Axis powers were often armed with. Thus ballistic nylon was replaced by Kevlar and other more bullet-resistant fabrics.  Modern uses  Although ballistic nylon was originally created and used in flak jackets, its durability and cutting resistance have made it useful for non-combat applications. It can be found in backpacks, luggage, belts and straps, motorcycle jackets, watch bands, and knife sheaths. It can also be used for structural purposes, such as on skin-on-frame kayaks. Ballistic nylon is used in chainsaw protective chaps covering the fronts of the chainsaw operator's legs. Such chaps are usually made with an outer layer of a tough smooth fabric like nylon or other synthetic fiber, with four plies of ballistic nylon inside. When the moving chainsaw chain contacts the chaps and tears the external layer, the inner plies shred. The strength of the ballistic nylon fiber will generally stop the moving chain quickly by causing the drive clutch to slip. As a result, the operator is relatively or completely uninjured by the chain. Due to its difficulty in dyeing, most products that use ballistic nylon will be found in black or other dark colors.

They were so named because the style was thought to have originated in Krak√≥w, then the capital of Poland. They are also known as poulaines or pikes, though the term poulaine, as in souliers √† la poulaine, \\"shoes in the Polish fashion\\", referred to the long pointed beak of the shoe, not the shoe itself. History Long-toed shoes had been popular in Europe at different times, first appearing in the archaeological record in the 12th century and falling in and out of fashion periodically. They reached their most exaggerated form in the third quarter of the 15th century before falling out of fashion in the 1480s. The arrival of this fashion in England is traditionally associated with the marriage of Richard II and Anne of Bohemia in 1382. An anonymous 'monk of Evesham' recorded in 1394: \\"With this queen there came from Bohemia into England those accursed vices (English Cracowys or Pykys) half a yard in length, thus it was necessary for them to be tied to the shin with chains of silver before they could walk with them.\\" However, there are indications they were worn as early as the 1360s. The author of the Eulogium Historiarum describes men of this period as wearing \\"points on their shoes as long as your finger that are called crakowes; more suitable as claws... for demons than as ornaments for men.\\" Fourteenth-century poulaine-toed shoes found in London were found only in men's sizes, but 15th century art shows them being worn by both men and women, with the toes of men's shoes being the most extravagantly long. They were a controversial fashion and faced criticism from several quarters. In 1368, Charles V of France issued an edict banning their construction and use in Paris. An English poem from 1388 complained that men were unable to kneel in prayer because their toes were too long. In 1463, Edward IV passed a sumptuary law restricting anyone \\"under the state of a Lord, Esquire, [or] Gentleman\\" from wearing poulaines over the length of two inches. In 1465, they were banned in England altogether, so that all cordwainers and cobblers within the City of London were prohibited from making shoes with pikes more than two inches long. The poulaine inspired later footwear fashions, such as the 1950s Winklepicker boots. FeaturesStuffing= Poulaine toes were packed with stuffing to provide rigidity and help them hold their shape. Surviving examples from medieval London have the points stuffed with moss. An Italian chronicler noted in 1388 that they were also sometimes stuffed with horsehair. =Tying up the toes= Although there is no archaeological or medieval iconographic evidence to support the idea that the toes were ever tied up to the leg, as noted earlier, there is direct literary evidence dating from 1394 which states that this was the practice at the time these shoes were introduced into England. Additionally, the practice is mentioned by the antiquarian John Stow in his 1698 publication A Survey of London, where he wrote: However, given that John Stow was writing over 100 years after the shoes fell out of fashion, and the lack of rigorous historical research in the writings of the time, he cannot be considered a reliable source. His record of Act 4 of Edward IV is exaggerated - the actual act does mention restrictions in length, but not monetary penalties, parliament or clergy: Archeon =Poulaines as overshoes= Overshoes made from leather or cork, called pattens, were frequently worn with late medieval shoes both indoors and outdoors. The shape of pattens reflected the style of shoes in different periods, and pattens during the period where poulaine toes were fashionable have matching long toes. These pattens would have supported the toe of the shoes if required. =Toe length= Archaeological evidence in the form of surviving shoe soles shows that the length of the point beyond the toes of the foot was rarely, if ever, more than 50% of the length of the foot.This is consistent with depictions of highly fashionable European men from the third quarter of the 15th century when poulaine toes were at the height of their popularity. Depiction of the Battle of Sempach in the Luzerner Schilling, showing a large pile of shoe-tips on a hill in the upper-left of the illustration (1513) As with many items of high fashion the most extreme examples were worn by the upper classes. In periods when poulaine toes were popular most shoes were somewhat pointed, even those used during warfare. There is clear evidence from the Battle of Sempach that in certain periods soldiers on campaign wore shoes with toes so long as to interfere with the wearer's ability to run. In that battle, it became necessary for the knights of Leopold III, Duke of Austria to dismount and fight on foot, and because they did not have time to prepare for the engagement, they were forced to cut off the tips of their poulaines. The Swiss chroniclers report how a huge pile of these shoe-tips was found in a heap after the battle, and they are also depicted in the background of the battle scene in the Luzerner Schilling of 1513. Sabatons of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, c. 1485 A surviving pair of sabatons belonging to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor have extremely long poulaines, but they were used only on horseback, and in this case the long points were detachable from the sabatons for foot combat. The catches can be seen over the area of the big toe.

The union with her first cousin was a marriage of state, arranged by her father George William, her father-in-law the Elector of Hanover, and her mother-in-law, Electress Sophia of Hanover, first cousin of King Charles II of England. She is best remembered for her alleged affair with Count Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck that led to her being imprisoned in the Castle of Ahlden for the last thirty years of her life. LifeEarly years= Born in Celle on 15 September 1666, Sophia Dorothea was the only surviving daughter of George William, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg-Celle by his morganatic wife, El√©onore Desmier d'Olbreuse (1639‚Äì1722), Lady of Harburg, a Huguenot French noblewoman. She grew up carefree in a loving environment. Her parents were, unlike many noble and royal couples of that time, deeply in love to each other and gave warmth and affection to their bright and talented daughter. As Sophia Dorothea was the product of a morganatic union and without any rights as a member of the House of Brunswick, her father wanted to secure her future. He transferred large assets to her over time, which made her an interesting marriage candidate. Candidates for her hand included Augustus Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Frederick Charles, Duke of W√ºrttemberg-Winnental, Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and even King Charles XI of Sweden. Sophia Dorothea's status was enhanced when, by Imperial order dated 22 July 1674 and in recognition to the military assistance given by her father to Emperor Leopold I, she and her mother received the higher title of \\"Countess of Harburg and Wilhelmsburg\\" (Gr√§fin von Harburg und Wilhelmsburg) with the allodial rights over those demesnes. At first, her parents agreed to the marriage between Sophia Dorothea and the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, eldest son of their distant relative Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, who had supported the love affair between George William and √âl√©onore from its beginnings. The official betrothal was signed on 20 December 1675. Unfortunately the groom was mortally wounded at the siege of Philippsburg on 9 August 1676. =Elevation of birth status and marriage= After the death of his daughter's fianc√©, George William was keen to negotiate an agreement over the inheritance of the Duchy of L√ºneburg. He initially approached his younger brother Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, to arrange a marriage between Sophia Dorothea and Ernest Augustus's eldest son George Louis, the future George I of Great-Britain. However, both his brother and sister-in-law, Sophia of the Palatinate, had misgivings about the proposed match due to the circumstances of Sophia Dorothea's birth. After the rejection of his daughter, George William decided to improve once for all the status of Sophia Dorothea and her mother; by contract signed on 22 August 1675, and in open violation of his previous promise never to marry, George William declared that √âl√©onore was his lawful wife in both church and state, with a second wedding ceremony being held at Celle on 2 April 1676. Ernest Augustus and Sophia stayed away from this second wedding. Twenty-two days later, on 24 April, El√©onore was officially addressed at court as Duchess of Brunswick and Sophia Dorothea became legitimate. Jacques Vaillant, ca. 1690‚Äì1691. Currently displayed at Bomann-Museum, Celle. This development alarmed George William's relatives. Now legitimated by the official marriage of her parents, Sophia Dorothea could threaten the planned union of the L√ºneburg territories. Finally, by an official agreement signed on 13 July 1680, the L√ºneburg royal family recognised √âl√©onore as Duchess of Brunswick and, most importantly, Sophia Dorothea was declared Princess of Brunswick-L√ºneburg-Celle, with all apertaining rights of birth. George Louis' parents finally agreed to the proposed union of their son to Sophia Dorothea. In the teeth of opposition from both Sophia Dorothea and his wife El√©onore, George William went ahead with arrangements for the wedding. The wedding took place on 21 November 1682. From its early days, the marriage was a complete failure. George Louis and his mother, Sophia of the Palatinate, had accepted the union, but felt contempt towards Sophia Dorothea, believing that her birth and manners were inferior. Explaining her reluctant support for the marriage, Duchess Sophia wrote to her niece Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orl√©ans: George Louis treated his bride with coldness and formality. He frequently scolded her for her lack of etiquette, and the two had loud and bitter arguments. Nevertheless, they managed to conceive two children in quick succession: George Augustus (future King George II of Great Britain, born on 30 October 1683) and Sophia Dorothea (future Queen consort in Prussia and Electress consort of Brandenburg, born on 16 March 1687). Having done his duty by the succession, George Louis acquired a mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, and started increasingly to neglect his wife. His parents asked him to be more circumspect with his mistress, fearful that a disruption in the marriage would threaten the payment of the 100,000 thalers he was to receive as part of Sophia Dorothea's dowry and inheritance from her father. =Affair with K√∂nigsmarck= Sophia Dorothea, by Henri Gascar, 1686. Currently displayed at Celle Castle museum. Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck, anonymous portrait, ca. 1690s. Currently displayed at Celle Castle museum. Around 1690, Sophia Dorothea was reunited with the Swedish Count Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck, whom she had known in her childhood when he was a page at the court of Celle. At first, their meetings were brief and sporadic, but this probably changed in 1691 and initially their closeness went unnoticed. Eventually, the open preference that Sophia Dorothea showed K√∂nigsmarck aroused suspicions, and by 1694 rumours filled the Hanoverian court that the Electoral Princess and Count von K√∂nigsmarck were having a love affair. Contemporary sources show that Sophia Dorothea and K√∂nigsmarck were presumed to have had a sexual relationship since March 1692, something she denied her entire life. After a violent argument with her husband, Sophia Dorothea travelled to her parents in Celle in the spring of 1694 to persuade them to support an official separation from her husband. George William and El√©onore opposed it. Sophia Dorothea's father was waging war against Denmark and Sweden and was dependent on the help of his brother Ernest Augustus, so he sent his daughter back to the Hanover court. In the summer of 1694 Sophia Dorothea, together with K√∂nigsmarck and her lady-in- waiting Eleonore von dem Knesebeck, planned an escape, hoping to find refuge either in Wolfenb√ºttel under the protection of Duke Anthony Ulrich, or in the Electorate of Saxony, where the Swedish Count held an officer position as major general of the cavalry.Mijndert Bertram: Das K√∂nigreich Hannover ‚Äì Kleine Geschichte eines vergangenen deutschen Staates(in German); Hannover: Hahn, 2003; But their plan was discovered and the disaster struck the lovers. K√∂nigsmarck's disappearance Countess Clara Elisabeth von Platen, a former mistress of Elector Ernest Augustus, had tried in January 1694 to persuade K√∂nigsmarck to marry her daughter Sophia Charlotte, but he had refused. Offended, she revealed to the Electoral Prince George Louis the love affair between his wife and the Swedish Count as well as their planned escape. Soon, the whole of Hanover knew of the planned elopement and the scandal erupted. Facade of the Leineschloss next to the Leine river, where probably the body of K√∂nigsmarck was thrown after his murder. On the night of 11 July 1694 and after a meeting with Sophia Dorothea in the Leineschloss, K√∂nigsmarck disappeared without a trace. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, he appears to have been killed on the orders, tacit or direct, of the Electoral Prince or of his father the Elector, and his body thrown into the river Leine weighted with stones. Those same sources claimed that four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers committed the murder, one of whom, Don Nicol√≤ Montalbano, received the enormous sum of 150,000 thalers, about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest paid minister. Sophia Dorothea would never find out what had happened to her lover. No trace of him was discovered. K√∂nigsmarck's disappearance turned into a diplomatic affair when not only relatives and the Hanoverian population but foreign diplomats and their governments began to puzzle over it. King Louis XIV of France questioned his sister-in-law Elizabeth Charlotte, the maternal first-cousin of the Electoral Prince, but she pretended ignorance. The French king then sent agents to Hanover, but they could no more shed light on the mystery than King Augustus II of Poland, who spent weeks searching for his missing general. In retaliation, the Elector of Hanover Ernest Augustus and his brother George William, Sophia Dorothea's father, turned to Emperor Leopold I with a formal complaint against the King of Poland. If the Imperial court didn't prevent Augustus II from carrying out ‚Äúunfriendly acts‚Äù against Hanover and Celle, they would withdraw their troops from the Grand Alliance in the war against France. Although the Emperor and the Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg exerted pressure on Augustus II, the Polish envoy continued the investigation and even faced Count von Platen, telling him that von K√∂nigsmarck had either been captured or killed on the orders of his wife the Countess, out of jealousy.From the reports of the English ambassador, Lord George Stepney. In 2016, construction workers found human bones in a pit while installing an elevator in the Leineschloss.Knochenfund am Landtag: Bringt DNA-Test Klarheit? (in German) in: Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung website (haz.de) [retrieved 09 August 2020]. These were initially assumed to be von K√∂nigsmarck's remains, but anthropological examinations of the bones showed that assumption to be unlikely. The love letters between Sophia Dorothea and K√∂nigsmarck When his affair with Sophia Dorothea threatened to become public, von K√∂nigsmarck handed their love letters to his brother-in-law, the Swedish Count Carl Gustav von L√∂wenhaupt. The latter's heirs later offered the correspondence to the House of Hanover for money but they demanded such a high price that the court rebuffed them and questioned the authenticity of the letters. The correspondence was published in the middle of the 19th century and the majority of the letters are now in the possession of Lund University in Sweden. A few of the letters ended up in the possession of Sophia Dorothea's grandson, King Frederick the Great of Prussia, after his sister, Swedish Queen consort Louisa Ulrika, allegedly stole them and sent them to him. Today the authenticity of the letters has been established beyond any doubt.Frederick the Great: Gedanken und Erinnerungen. Werke, Briefe, Gespr√§che, Gedichte, Erlasse, Berichte und Anekdoten (in German); Essen: Phaidon, 1996. The lovers rarely dated their letters but they numbered most of them. The Hanoverian historian Georg Schnath calculated on the basis of the existing correspondence that there must have been originally 660 letters: 340 letters written by von K√∂nigsmarck and 320 by Sophia Dorothea. The missing letters seem to have been confiscated and destroyed by the Hanoverian authorities after the affair became public. State Archives in Hanover provide scant information about the critical years. Even the correspondence between Electress Sophia and her niece Elizabeth Charlotte, which could have shed some light on some of the events, were censored afterwards. =Divorce and imprisonment= 200px Hanover had dealt with von K√∂nigsmarck, but that was not enough to restore the honour of the Electoral Prince George Louis in his own eyes. He demanded a legal separation from his wife, citing her as sole culprit on grounds of desertion. In addition to divorce proceedings, he had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned and transferred to Lauenau Castle in late 1694 and placed under house arrest. On 28 December 1694, the dissolution of the marriage was officially pronounced; the Electoral Princess was named as the guilty party for \\"maliciously leaving her husband\\". Under the judgment, Sophia Dorothea was forbidden to remarry or to see her children again; official documents would remove her name, she was stripped from her title of Electoral Princess and churches in Hanover were longer to mention her name in prayers. After the divorce, George Louis sent her to remote Ahlden House, a stately home on the L√ºneburg Heath, which served as a prison appropriate to her status. Although the divorce judgment says nothing about continued imprisonment, she was never to regain her freedom. At the behest of her former husband and with the consent of her own father, Sophia Dorothea was imprisoned for life. George Louis confiscated the assets she brought to the marriage and allocated her an annual maintenance. She initially received 8,000 thalers for herself and her court, which was later raised to 28,000 thalers, a sum to which George Louis and her father George William paid in equal parts. She was detained in the north wing of the castle, a two-story half-timbered building, guarded 24 hours a day by 40 men-at-arms, 5 to 10 of whom were on duty at any one time. Her mail and visits were strictly controlled, though her mother had unlimited visiting rights. As far as historians know, she never attempted escape. Initially, Sophia Dorothea was only allowed to walk unaccompanied inside the mansion courtyard; later, she was permitted under guard in the outdoor facilities. After two years in prison, she could take supervised trips two kilometres outside the castle walls. Her stay in Ahlden was interrupted several times due to war or renovation work on the residence. During these times she was transferred to Celle Castle or to Essel. Her court included two ladies-in-waiting, several chambermaids and other household and kitchen staff. These had all been selected for their loyalty to Hanover. After her imprisonment, Sophia Dorothea was known as ‚ÄúPrincess of Ahlden‚Äù, after her new place of residence. At first, she was extremely apathetic and resigned to her fate; in later years she tried to obtain her release. When her former father- in-law died in 1698, she sent a humble letter of condolence to her former husband, assuring him that \\"she prayed for him every day and begged him on her knees to forgive her mistakes. She will be eternally grateful to him if he allows her to see her two children\\". She also wrote a letter of condolence to Electress Sophia, her ex-mother-in-law, claiming that she wanted nothing more than \\"to kiss your Highness' s hands before I die\\". Her requests were in vain: George Louis, later George I of Great Britain, would never forgive her, nor would his mother. When Sophia Dorothea's father was on his deathbed in 1705, he wanted to see his daughter one last time to reconcile with her, but his Prime Minister, Count Bernstorff, objected and claimed that a meeting would lead to diplomatic problems with Hanover; George William no longer had the strength to assert himself and died without seeing his daughter. Sophia Dorothea is remembered for a significant act of charity during her imprisonment: after the devastating local fire of Ahlden in 1715, she contributed considerable sums of money towards the town's reconstruction. =Death and burial= The death of her mother in 1722 left Sophia Dorothea alone and surrounded only by enemies, as El√©onore of Celle had been the only one to continue fighting for her release and for the right to see her children again. Sophia Dorothea's daughter, the Queen of Prussia, travelled to Hanover in 1725 to see her father, by then King George I of Great Britain; Sophia Dorothea, dressed even more carefully than usual, waited in vain every day at the window of her residence, hoping to see her daughter. In the end, she seems only to have found comfort in eating. Her defences waned, she grew overweight due to lack of exercise and was frequently plagued by febrile colds and indigestion. In early 1726, she suffered a stroke; in August of that year she went to bed with a severe colic, and never rose again, refusing all food and treatment. Within a few weeks she grew emaciated. Sophia Dorothea died shortly before midnight on 13 November 1726 aged 60; her autopsy revealed a liver failure and gall bladder occlusion due to 60 gallstones. Her former husband placed an announcement in The London Gazette to the effect that the \\"Duchess of Ahlden\\" had died, but forbade mourning in London or Hanover. He was furious when he heard that his daughter's court in Berlin wore black. Sophia Dorothea's funeral turned into a farce. Because the guards in Ahlden castle had no instructions, they placed her remains in a lead coffin and deposited them in the cellar. In January 1727 the order came from London to bury her without any ceremonies in the cemetery of Ahlden, which was impossible due to weeks of heavy rain. So the coffin was brought back to the cellar and covered in sand. It wasn't until May 1727 that Sophia Dorothea was buried, secretly and at night, beside her parents in the Stadtkirche in Celle.The royal crypt and the grave slabs of the dukes of Braunschweig-L√ºneburg in the town church of St. Marien Celle, with a leaflet illustrated with photos by Dietrich Klatt, Friedrich Kremzow and Ralf Pfeiffer, in DIN A5 format (4 pages) designed by Heide Kremzow, after: Dietrich Klatt: Little Art Guide Schnell & Steiner N¬∞ 1986, 2008.Das Grab der Prinzessin von Ahlden (in German) in: knerger.de [retrieved 09 August 2020]. King George I of Great Britain, her former husband and gaoler, died four weeks later, while visiting Hanover. =Inheritance= Sophia Dorothea's parents seem to have believed to the last that their daughter would one day be released from prison. In January 1705, shortly before her father's death, he and his wife drew up a joint will, according to which their daughter would receive the estates of Ahlden, Rethem and Walsrode, extensive estates in France and Celle, the great fortune of her father and the legendary jewellery collection of her mother. Her father appointed Count Heinrich Sigismund von Bar as administrator of Sophia Dorothea's fortune; twelve years older than the princess and a handsome, highly educated and sensitive gentleman, Count von Bar and Sophia Dorothea shared old ties of affection. She named him as one of the main beneficiaries of her will, but unfortunately he died six years before her. Related history and trivia *In 1698 Sophia Dorothea's former husband George Louis took office in the Electorate of Hanover. In 1701, the English Parliament passed the Act of Settlement, which declared Electress Sophia of Hanover the next Protestant successor to the English throne. In 1707, the Treaty of Union created the United Kingdom of England and Scotland and Queen Anne became the first Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. As Electress Sophia died a few weeks before Queen Anne's death in 1714, it was her son Elector George Louis who succeeded as King and moved to London. The personal union between Hanover and Great Britain lasted 123 years. *Eleonore von dem Knesebeck (1655‚Äì1717), Sophia Dorothea's lady-in-waiting and close confidant, was imprisoned in 1695 in Scharzfels Castle in the borough of Herzberg am Harz. After two years of solitary confinement, she managed to escape on 5 November 1697 and was able to flee to Wolfenb√ºttel under the protection of Duke Anthony Ulrich. She left a unique document in the room of the tower where she was confined: all the walls and doors were written down to the last corner with charcoal and chalk. The texts (sacred poems in the style of contemporary church hymns), where accusations against her enemies at court and memoir-like prose pieces; all these were recorded for the Hanover archive files. Until her death, she denied the adulterous relationship between Sophia Dorothea and von K√∂nigsmarck. Henrike Leonhardt: Flucht der Eleonore v. d. Knesebeck [05.11.1697] (in German) [retrieved 09 August 2020]. *The French adventurer, Marquis Armand de Lassay (1652‚Äì1738), later claimed in his memoirs that he had received no fewer than thirteen love letters from Sophia Dorothea but never showed any documents to anyone. *As the ‚Äúuncrowned Queen of Great Britain‚Äù, the life and tragic fate of Sophia Dorothea fascinated the imaginations of her contemporaries and of posterity. In 1804, Friedrich von Schiller had even planned a tragedy dedicated to her, called The Princess of Celle, but never completed it.Georg Ruppelt: Schiller in Hanover in: schillerjahr2005.de [dead link, last access date 24 December 2008]. *Sophia Dorothea's great-granddaughter Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, Queen consort of Denmark and Norway (1751‚Äì1775) shared her same fate. After the Struensee affair in 1772, she was divorced from her husband, separated from her children and sent to Celle Castle, where she died three years later. In the crypt of the Stadtkirche St. Marien, both women are united in death. *The life story of Sophia Dorothea was recorded by Arno Schmidt in his novel Das steinerne Herz ‚Äì Ein historischer Roman aus dem Jahre 1954 nach Christi, some scenes of which take place in Ahlden and - for one episode - Berlin. In the novel, Schmidt gradually inserts the story of the Princess of Ahlden into the narrative and mentions Ahlden House several times as a walking destination for the protagonists, who eventually find a treasure in Sophia Dorothea's estate and prosper from it. Film *Sophia Dorothea's affair and its tragic outcome is the basis of the 1948 British film Saraband for Dead Lovers. She was portrayed by Joan Greenwood.

The airport is located near the eastern coast of Ishigaki Island. It connects the island to major cities in Japan as well as destinations throughout Okinawa Prefecture and the Yaeyama Islands. New Ishigaki Airport was built to replace Ishigaki Airport, which with a shorter runway of only , could not accommodate larger jets. Operations at [old] Ishigaki Airport ceased at midnight on March 6, 2013, and New Ishigaki Airport opened on March 7, 2013. Location Aerial view of New Ishigaki Airport New Ishigaki Airport is located on the eastern shore of Ishigaki Island (). The island is located approximately southwest of Okinawa Island. The Yaeyama Islands were traditionally controlled from the southern district of the island, and remains the chief island of the group. The airport serves as a transportation hub for the surrounding Miyako, Yonaguni, Hateruma, and Tarama islands. The airport additionally connects Ishigaki to Tokyo (via Haneda Airport), Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Fukuoka. Ishigaki is only a 40-minute flight from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) in Taiwan. Ishigaki currently hosts seasonal flights to Taiwan. New Ishigaki Airport sits above sea level in the Shiraho district of Ishigaki. The airport is located approximately 30 minutes by car from central Ishigaki City (i.e., Ishigaki Harbor). Facilities New Ishigaki Airport covers . It consists of a single runway, in length and in width. The airport has a single terminal with a total floor space of . The first floor of the terminal is used for check-in and baggage claim. The second floor is used as an entrance, the third floor for facilities management, and the fourth floor as an observation deck. New Ishigaki Airport operates 11 hours a day, between 8 am and 7 pm. Administration Under the Airport Law of 1956 New Ishigaki Airport was originally classified as a Regional Airport (the old airport was classified as Third Class airport). According to a September 4, 2013, front-page article in the Yaeyama Mainichi Shinbun (one of the newspapers in Ishigaki), the airport is now classified as an International Airport, which means that Taiwanese carriers will change from a system of providing what they call \\"regular charter flights\\" to offering regular scheduled flights.http://www.y-mainichi.co.jp:8000/news/23215/ „Åç„Çá„ÅÜ„Åã„ÇâÂÆöÊúü‰æø„Å´ Ê≠£Âºè„Å™ÂõΩÈöõÁ©∫Ê∏Ø„Å∏ Yaeyama Mainichi Shinbun (in Japanese) New Ishigaki Airport was constructed by government of Okinawa Prefecture at a cost of 45.1 trillion yen and is now owned and operated by the City of Ishigaki. The airport has 24 tenants, mainly locally operated restaurants and souvenir shops. History Construction site of New Ishigaki Airport, 2009 New Ishigaki Airport replaces Ishigaki Airport, which was originally built during World War II as a military airstrip by the Imperial Japanese Army.Some sources date the completion of the military airstrip to 1942, others to 1943. Korean laborers were used for the construction of the military airstrip. The airstrip was built in the Maezato and ≈åhama districts of Ishigaki, and opened in September 1942. The airstrip was used for the deployment of kamikaze units to attack American ships anchored off Okinawa Island during the Battle of Okinawa. After World War II the airstrip was repaired, and eventually converted to joint civilian/military use in 1956, and commercial flights to Ishigaki began on June 16 of that year. The new airport was built to replace Ishigaki Airport, which had a runway of only , and could generally accommodate small jets, typically a 150-passenger Boeing 737. The initial plan called for an airport to be built on extensive landfill off the eastern shore of the island in the Shiraho district. Plans for a new airport on the Ishigaki Island date back to 1979. Residents of Shiraho opposed the construction of New Ishigaki Airport, among other reasons, due to concerns about the destruction of the Shiraho Coral Reef. The reef is home to over 120 species of coral, and is one of the most diverse coral reefs in Japan, and is named as one of the \\"Global 200\\" coral reefs by the World Wildlife Fund. The Shiraho district and its reef is protected as part of Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park (), which covers both the land and marine areas of much of the Yaeyama Islands. The Shiraho reef is particularly vulnerable to destruction by red clay discharged from small rivers and other discharge from Ishigaki Island. This plan was abandoned in 1989. A second plan, which was ultimately adopted, called for the airport to be built inland from the coast, using both agricultural land and excavating a section from Karadake, a prominent hill on the relatively flat landscape of Ishigaki Island. Construction on the new airport started in 2006 with the excavation of Karadake. 270,000 ha¬≤ of soil from Karadake were removed, significantly changing the appearance of the landscape of Shiraho. The excavation of Karadake posed a continuing threat to the Shiraho coral reef. The hill is composed of red clay, and discharge of soil from the excavation presented a serious threat of destruction of the reef. Human remains, now known as the Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins, were discovered at the site shortly after construction began on the airport. Bones from human heads, feet, arms were found and dated to the Paleolithic Age, and are approximately 24,000 years old. The remains may be the oldest human remains found in Japan. Work at the archaeological site ended with the opening of the airport in 2013. As a promotion prior to the opening of the airport and the locally produced Ishigaki beef, a giant kebab was constructed on the construction area of the new airport. Assembly of the kebab required the effort of 1,700 residents and tourists, and ultimately measured in length. The kebab was certified a Guinness World Record, beating out the former record-holder constructed in Lebanon. New Ishigaki Airport is designated a under the Airport Law of Japan. An opening ceremony for the airport was held on March 2, 2013. Operations at Ishigaki Airport ceased at midnight on March 6, 2013, and airport equipment such as luggage carts and handling equipment were trucked across the island overnight. New Ishigaki Airport officially started operations at 12 a.m., March 7, 2013. Airlines and destinationsPassenger=Ground Transportation New Ishigaki Airport is connected to other areas of Ishigaki Island by bus and taxi. Ishigaki is served by the Azuma Bus Company. Additionally, a rental car service is available at the airport. The airport sits along Okinawa Prefectural Route 39, which crosses the eastern and southern coast of the island.

Commercial operations at Ishigaki Airport ceased at midnight on March 6, 2013, and New Ishigaki Airport opened on March 7, 2013. As of mid-2013, the possibility exists that the airport may be turned over fully to the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. As a Type-3 airport, the JSDF was already in theory able to carry out operations from Ishigaki. History The airport was opened in 1943 for military use, and converted to a civilian airport in 1956. The runway was extended from in 1968, allowing YS-11 aircraft to land.  Replacement  The airport served about 1.8 million passengers a year, making it the second busiest third-class airport in Japan, behind Kobe Airport, and traffic grew steadily as the Yaeyama Islands become a popular tourist destination. The runway of Ishigaki Airport could not accommodate planes larger than a Boeing 737, and the present site was not suitable for expansion due to urban encroachment. The airport also did not have facilities for handling standard cargo containers. To meet these needs New Ishigaki Airport was constructed on the eastern side of the island, replaced Ishigaki Airport. Plans for the new airport dated to 1979, when the prefectural government planned to build a runway by the shore of the Shiraho (ÁôΩ‰øù) district. However, due to concerns about coral, the residents of Shiraho long opposed the project. In addition, historical artifacts from the Shiraho Saonetabaru Cave Ruins some 18,000 to 15,000 years old were discovered, affecting the timeline of the project.

Angelov, Byzantinism: The Imaginary and Real Heritage of Byzantium in Southeastern Europe, in Dimitris Keridis, Ellen Elias-Bursaƒá, Nicholas Yatromanolakis, New approaches to Balkan studies, Brassey's, 2003, , Google Print, p.3Angelov 2003, p.11 The term byzantinism itself was coined in the 19th century.Angelov 2003, p.8 The term has primarily negative associations, implying complexity and autocracy. This negative reputation stressed the confusing complexities of the Empire's ministries and the elaborateness of its court ceremonies. Likewise, the \\"Byzantine system\\" also suggests a penchant for intrigue, plots and assassinations and an overall unstable political state of affairs. The term has been criticized by modern scholars for being a generalization that is not very representative of the reality of the Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy.Angelov 2003, p.6Angelov 2003, pp.17‚Äì18 Aristocracy and bureaucracy The Byzantine Empire is a modern term applied by Westerners to the Eastern Roman Empire (that survived a thousand years after the western one collapsed in 476) and thus had a complex system of aristocracy and bureaucracy which was derived from earlier Roman systems. At the apex of the pyramid stood the Emperor, sole ruler and divinely ordained, and beneath him a multitude of officials and court functionaries operated the administrative machinery of the state. A key component of state power was the prestige of the Imperial institution and its long antiquity. Ceremony and the granting of both honorific titles and valuable offices was therefore extensive and elaborate. Over the nearly fifteen hundred years of the empire's existence, different titles were adopted and discarded, and many lost or gained prestige. By the time of Heraclius in the 7th century many of the early Roman titles, grounded in the Latin language and the traditions of the old Roman republic had become obsolete in the now mostly Greek-speaking empire, although Latin survived longer in law and in the military. Heraclius formally changed the official language to Greek from Latin in 610. Titles inspired by their Greek tradition, often only rough approximation of Latin concepts, became common (i.e. \\"basileus\\" [Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœçœÇ] instead of \\"caesar\\" or \\"augustus\\" for the title of the emperor himself). Other titles changed meaning (for example, \\"Patriarch\\") or were devalued with time (such as \\"consul\\"). Among important qualities of the Empire was also the caesaropapism, the subjugation of church to the state.Angelov 2003, pp.4‚Äì5 Criticism The Byzantine Empire acquired a negative reputation in the Western world as early as the Middle Ages.Angelov 2003, p.6 The creation of the Holy Roman Empire by Charlemagne in the 9th century and the East‚ÄìWest Schism in the 11th century made the Empire an outcast to the Western European countries following the Roman Church, and the siege and sack of Constantinopole during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 only cemented those differences. Hence the European medieval stereotypes of the people of the Byzantine Empire portrayed them as perfidious, treacherous, servile, effeminate and unwarlike. Medievalist Steven Runciman described the medieval European view of the Byzantine Empire by saying: Criticism of the Empire continued among historians of the 18th century and 19th century, particularly in the works of historians and philosophers influenced by The Enlightenment. Edward Gibbon, Hegel, Johann Gottfried Herder, William Lecky, Montesquieu, and Voltaire were among the many Western writers of that period who were critical of the Byzantine system.Cyril Mango, The Oxford history of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 2002, , Google Print, p.v Edward Gibbon, the first English historian to write a full history of the Byzantine Empire in his The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776‚Äì1789), was a sharp critic of the Empire.Angelov 2003, p.9 Jacob Burckhardt, an influential 19th-century historian shared Gibbon's view: Critics pointed out that the Byzantine Empire and its successors were uninfluenced by such major shifts in Western philosophy as the Investiture Controversy, the Reformation and the Renaissance; and reduced the Byzantine political culture to caesaropapism and authoritarian political culture, described as authoritarian, despotic, and imperialistic. After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, critics of the Byzantine system pointed out that it has survived and \\"corrupted\\" other states, in particular, it has been used in the discourse of the political system, culture and society of the Russia (from the times of the Grand Duchy of Moscow through the tsardom of Russia to the Russian Empire ‚Äì see also tsarist autocracy),Angelov 2003, p.12 the Soviet Union,Angelov 2003, p.13 the Ottoman EmpireAngelov 2003, p.18 and the Balkan states (the former European provinces of the Ottoman Empire).Angelov 2003, pp.12‚Äì13 Modern historians point out that this negative reputation is not necessarily true, and at the very least, a very simplistic generalization. As a constructed term, Byzantinism also shares those fallacies with a closely related term, Balkanism.Angelov 2003, pp.6‚Äì7 Angelov sums it up as follows: Praise While the Byzantine Empire was commonly seen in a negative fashion, there were exceptions. Byzantium was rehabilitated in France during the Age of Absolutism, from the 17th century to the French Revolution, in the works of such individuals as the Jesuit Pierre Poussines. As the Enlightenment swept Western Europe, French traditions found refuge in the Russian Empire. The term Byzantinism was used in a positive context by 19th-century Russian scholar Konstantin Leontiev in Byzantism and Slavdom (1875) to describe the type of society which the Russian Empire needed to counter the \\"degenerating influence\\" of the West.Richard Pipes, Russian Conservatism and Its Critics: A Study in Political Culture, Yale University Press, 2007, , Google Print, pp.148‚Äì149 Leontiev praised the Byzantine Empire and the tsarist autocracy, and a society and political system that comprises authoritative power of the monarch, devout following of the Russian Orthodox Church, the maintenance of obshchina for peasants, and sharp class division; he also criticized universal education and democracy.K. A. Lantz, The Dostoevsky encyclopedia, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004 , Google Print, p.235Aleksandr Polunov, Thomas C. Owen, Larisa Georgievna Zakharova, Marshall S. Shatz, Russia in the nineteenth century: autocracy, reform, and social change, 1814‚Äì1914 , M.E. Sharpe, 2005, , Google Print, p.175 In Russian political discourse, Russia is sometimes affectionately called Third Rome, the second Rome being the Eastern Roman Empire, which outlived its western counterpart at Rome itself, the first Rome, by a thousand years.Matthew Raphael Johnson, The Third Rome: Holy Russia, Tsarism and Orthodoxy, The Foundation for Economic Liberty, Inc, 2004, Evgeny Pavlov, The new Third Rome? Moscow in the Russian culture of the 1990s In his article, \\"Was There Ever Byzantinism?\\" Alexander Mirkovic argued that many Western authors have created an imagined picture of Byzantium as a projection of their own anxieties. Modern discourse In a modern context it can be used to denote undemocratic practices and the use of violence in political life; it has been often used in the context of South-Eastern European (Balkan) politics.Cathie Carmichael, Ethnic Cleansing in the Balkans: Nationalism and the Destruction of Tradition, Routledge, 2002, , Google Print, p.100 The \\"baggage\\" of Byzantine tradition is used to explain the delays in developing democratic institutions, the preference for the strong, even autocratic governments, people's distrust of businessmen and elected politicians, and overall, to explain the difference between the West and South-East and Eastern Europe. The word \\"Byzantinism\\" and related, like \\"Byzantine\\", have acquired negative connotations in several West European languages, including the English language.

The Longest Cocktail Party is one man's account of the history of the Beatles' company Apple Corps, the break-up of the Beatles, and the beginning of their solo careers. The title is a reference to the press office's habit of entertaining members of the media, and the company's potential business partners, with expensive drinks, luncheons and perks - which ultimately led to a financial and spiritual hangover, as did the unrealised potential of the company. DiLello served as the \\"house hippie\\" (formally termed Client Liaison Officer; a sort of in-house youth consultant and gofer) at Apple's Savile Row headquarters, from 1968 until 1970, becoming one-on-one acquainted with each of the Beatles, many of their wives and girlfriends, and also the inner circle of agents, managers, and others who worked for and with Apple. These included business manager Allen Klein, attorneys Lee Eastman and John Eastman, road managers (and Apple directors) Mal Evans and Neil Aspinall, press agent and author Derek Taylor, members of Apple bands Badfinger and White Trash, the staff, and the countless visitors to the office. DiLello covers events including the launching parties for Apple Records and artists like White Trash and Mary Hopkin, the ill-fated Apple Christmas party in 1968 (with two Hells Angels as guests), the Beatles' rooftop concert appearing in Let It Be, the lawsuits that began as the Beatles grew apart, and finally the closing of the Apple press office. In addition to shooting the cover portrait of Badfinger for their Straight Up album, DiLello also went on to write the script for the 1983 Sean Penn film Bad Boys. This seemed an obvious avenue for DiLello, as The Longest Cocktail Party nearly functions as a film script in itself. The several appendices to the book include the full text of the self-penned \\"interview\\" issued by Paul McCartney with the pre-release copies of his first solo album (McCartney), that effectively announced the band's breakup in April 1970; a discography of Apple Records releases; a list of the Beatles' achievements as recording artists; and text of several British news articles about Apple. On 7 May 2010, it was confirmed that the book is to be made into a feature film. It is currently in development by Liam Gallagher's In 1 Productions. In 2015, the book was re- released by Alfred Music. This officially authorized edition features a new foreword written by DiLello.

It broadcasts the programming of the CBC Radio One network. CBR's studios are located on Westmount Boulevard Northwest just west of downtown Calgary, while its transmitters are located in Southeast Calgary. CBR's daytime signal covers most of the southern two-thirds of Alberta. It can be heard at city-grade strength from Red Deer to Lethbridge, and provides secondary coverage as far as Edmonton to the north and several counties on the Montana-Alberta border to the south. At night, it covers most of western North America. As of spring 2013, CBR was the second most listened-to radio station, the most listened-to AM radio station, in the Calgary market. History Vancouver's CBC station was initially assigned the CBR callsign from 1936 to 1952. The Calgary station was launched 12 years later in 1964. Before then, Calgary had been one of the last major markets in Canada without an owned-and- operated CBC radio station. Originally, Calgary's CBC outlet had been private affiliate CFAC. From 1948 to 1964, CBX in Edmonton doubled as Calgary's CBC station as well, serving the southern two-thirds of the province from its transmitter at Lacombe (halfway between the two cities). The new station took over CBX's old frequency at 1010 AM and its clear-channel designation, while CBX was reoriented to be Edmonton's CBC station. The call sign CBR was previously used by CBU in Vancouver from 1937 to 1951. On March 16, 2006, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved an application by the station to implement a new, nested FM transmitter in Calgary itself to simulcast the AM programming, due to the AM signal's poor reception in some parts of the city.CRTC Decision 2006-84 This new FM signal, CBR-1-FM 99.1 was launched on November 28, 2006.\\"Completely Calgary\\", CBC.ca.

It is a species of New World warbler. Measurements: * Length: 5.5 in (14 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.5 oz (9-13 g) * Wingspan: 7.9 in (20 cm) Hermit warblers are dark gray in coloration on top, and white below, and their flanks are streaked with black. The wings have two diagonal white wing bars. The majority of the hermit warbler's head is yellow, and males have a dark black throat, while females have much less black on their throat bib and immature birds have no black throat. Hermit warblers are common, but incredibly shy, birds that dwell in open coniferous forests. Their summer breeding range is the majority of the west coast of the United States up to Washington. They will sometimes winter in south-west California, but they are migratory and will winter in Central America as far south as Panama. Nests are neat and cup-shaped, constructed from stems, grass, twigs, and pine needles positioned near the tip of a branch high in a conifer tree. The female will lay between 3 and 5 eggs, which are white in color and heavily spotted with brown and lilac speckles. Other incubation and nesting habits are mostly unknown. Like most warblers the hermit warbler eats a strict diet of insects and spiders, and can often be found hanging upside-down from the ends of conifer branches, like a chickadee, probing for food.

Its headquarters were in the Lower Queen Anne area of Seattle, Washington.\\"Employment.\\" Pro Air. May 23, 1998. Retrieved on September 18, 2009.  Code data  *IATA Code: XL (P9 was also used) *ICAO Code: PRH *Callsign: Prohawk  History  Pro Air charged extremely low fares and experienced high passenger load factors on most of its flights; however, many of its flights were delayed with mechanical and crew problems. When Pro Air 737s underwent \\"C\\" maintenance checks, Spirit Airlines, Pan Am Clipper Connection, and Casino Express operated their flights for them via charters. A Pan Am Boeing 727 collapsed the fence at the end of runway 33 in at Detroit City Airport (DET) due to having to significantly increase engine thrust because of the short runway takeoff length of 5000 ft. Pro Air required its initial employees to go door to door in the metropolitan Detroit area and pass out flyers promoting the airline. The airline's first flight crew base was located in Indianapolis. Most employees moved to the Detroit area when the Detroit City Airport hub operation commenced in 1998. Pro Air was in direct competition with Northwest Airlines on many of their routes. They originally started with a single fare for everyone, but about 18 months afterwards they went to tiered fares with advance purchase requirements. They also had originally served full meals in coach (in addition to first class) but scrapped the program after realizing that the cost of the meal accounted for, on average, 10% of the fare that the customer paid. They were known for their signature \\"hot meal\\" service (even on the 35 minute DET-MDW route) in First Class along with premium alcoholic beverage service, and were the only airline to charge a mere $2 for beer and wine in Economy class (mixed drinks were $3). Pro Air pioneered one of the lowest fares on the DET-LGA-DET route at $59 each way (which has since been topped by Spirit Airlines‚Äô $0.01 fares). \\"Founder's Fares\\" were offered for those passengers who already flew them as a \\"thank you\\" promotion. Detroit-area vehicle manufacturers General Motors and Chrysler also had programs in place for their employees and their families who flew on Pro Air with discounted fares of $30 each way being available. On July 2, 2000, a Pro Air pilot taxied a plane into a luggage conveyor belt at Orlando. No one was hurt, but the plane's left wing was so severely damaged that the Federal Aviation Administration deemed the incident an accident. An investigation revealed that the pilot had ignored a number of signals before colliding with the belt. After a subsequent investigation revealed numerous other safety violations, the FAA grounded Pro Air on September 18, 2000. Pro Air filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy soon afterward, and sought permission to resume operations pending NTSB review. However, the NTSB rejected Pro Air's bid to return to the skies on September 28. Its aircraft were quickly repossessed by the lessor soon afterward.  Destinations  During its existence, Pro Air operated flights from Detroit City to Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Chicago Midway Airport, New York LaGuardia Airport, Orlando International Airport, Fort Myers, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Newark, Philadelphia, Seattle, Atlanta and Tampa. In 1998, it was also operating nonstop flights between Indianapolis and two destinations in Florida, Fort Myers and Orlando.http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 1, 1998 Pro Air route map By early 2000, it had ceased serving Fort Myers, Milwaukee and Tampa.http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 24, 2000 Pro Air route map Due to Detroit City's short runways limiting the amount of fuel the aircraft could carry on takeoff, flights to Seattle and Florida stopped in Chicago and Atlanta, respectively. Tickets could be purchased for just the Chicago-Seattle or Atlanta-Florida portions of the flights.  Fleet  It operated a small fleet, starting with two Boeing 737-400 jetliners, and then expanding to three Boeing 737-400 and one Boeing 737-300 aircraft. The 737-400 had a seating configuration of 138 in coach and eight in first class, with slightly increased legroom in both classes when compared to seating offered by major U.S. airlines. Pro Air had McDonnell Douglas MD-90 jetliners on order; however, the airline shut down before the first aircraft could be delivered, but not before it was painted. Just before Pro Air's demise, General Motors (GM) had been in talks to offer their three corporate-configured Saab 2000 turboprop aircraft to the airline, indicating that they would choose which routes and frequencies the aircraft would operate on as Pro Air Express flights; however, the deal was never consummated due to the airline shutting down operations.Pro Air Acquires Aircraft to Launch Pro Air Express; New Service to Feed Jet Flights From Smaller Cities., PR Newswire, August 25, 1999 Aircraft in fleet: * Boeing 737-300 * Boeing 737-400 * McDonnell Douglas MD-90 (ordered but not operated prior to Pro Air's shut down of all flights) Pro Air also chartered aircraft from other airlines as demand warranted including Boeing 727-200 jetliners operated by Pan Am.

The game is based on serial novels that were written by John Saul, titled Blackstone Chronicles. A sequel to the novels, the game takes place several years after the sixth book, and continues the story of Oliver Metcalf, his family, and the town of Blackstone. Plot The game starts with Oliver arriving at the Blackstone Asylum, which has been purchased and is being turned into a Museum of Psychiatric History. That doesn't sit well with Malcolm Metcalf, Oliver's father and last superintendent of the Asylum, who died some forty years before. All of the activity involved in transforming the Asylum has awakened its residents. For reasons not yet known to Oliver or the player, his father's spirit has taken his son, Joshua, and hidden him somewhere in the Asylum, apparently to coerce Oliver there. Exploring the mansion, Oliver encounters several spirits of patients who are bound to the asylum by their possessions, including a teenage girl with hysterical pregnancy, a schizophrenic who believes she's English royalty, and a depressed woman who was treated with steam baths and hydrotherapy. Oliver discovers that his father psychologically tortured to suicide or allowed several of his patients to be killed under the guise of accidents during treatment. This is counterpointed by the sterile and rose-tinted explanations from the museum equipment for the same procedures or implements (lancets are described as an attempt to bring the bodies humours into balance, where the spirit of a patient with Alzheimer's disease declares they were used liberally so patients could not defend themselves). Disheartened by the failure of traditional medicine, Oliver's father gradually turned to more and more extreme methods, including totally dismembering and vivisecting an 8-year-old boy to cure his illness. Eventually his treatments turned to outright torture, as a punishment of undesirable behaviors to eventually remove them. Over the course of the game, Oliver collects several personal items that influence him, causing him to nearly kill himself in several psychiatric methods (ECT, self- injecting neuro-toxins, locking himself in a steam box). His father Malcolm implies this is caused by the inherent evil contained within the items, although its heavily implied that Oliver developed these traps himself while under Malcolm's control, through a long, complicated sequence of post-hypnotic suggestions. Oliver's father eventually reveals his plan. While Oliver has been trapped in the asylum and continued to refuse Malcolm's demands that Oliver take vengeance on Malcolm's enemies, Malcolm returned Joshua home, and instructs him to murder his mother with a straight razor, as a punishment of Oliver for his disobedience to his father and to make Joshua a monster with Malcolm's similar outlook. With the help of the spirits trapped in the asylum, Oliver destroys the artifacts of his father throughout the asylum, banishing his fathers spirit.

However, he wrote that Blackstone Chronicles has \\"good atmosphere, well-integrated puzzles, and the occasional truly memorable scene.\\" Reviewing the game for PC Gamer US, T. Liam McDonald called it \\"the kind of narrative-driven, atmospheric adventure game we see too little of in these days of soulless Myst clones.\\" While he disliked its visuals and lack of character interaction, he felt that Blackstone Chronicles offered \\"enough to recommend it to many adventure-starved gamers.\\" Blackstone Chronicles was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1998 \\"Best Adventure\\" award, which ultimately went to Grim Fandango and Sanitarium (tie).

Going green CFRM has implemented a plan to become an environmentally friendly radio station. The project to go \\"green\\" consists of three phases: * Phase I - Installing a wind turbine with grid tie at the tower site to help power the transmitter plant. This project was completed mid June 2008. * Phase II - Installing a vertical wind turbine at CFRM's studios in Little Current. This project will be completed by October 2008. * Phase III - Installing multiple wind turbines at the tower site, effectively creating a small wind farm which would also put excess power onto the grid.\\"How to run a radio station on green energy for next to nothing\\". TVOntario, September 21, 2016. More recently, the station has pursued further environmental initiatives. As of 2014, the station's daytime studio operations are powered entirely by a diesel electric generator running on used fryer oil recycled from local restaurants. In early 2015, the station also added a bidirectional electricity meter, so that unused power from the generator can be contributed back into the electrical grid. During its history as a low-power experimental station, CFRM served a testbed for technologies, such as Ibiquity's IBOC digital radio system, which are rarely used elsewhere in Canada.

In 2018, Gladwyne was ranked the 6th richest ZIP code (using 2015 IRS data) in the country in a study by Bloomberg BusinessWeek. The population was 4,071 at the 2010 US census. As Gladwyne is neither an incorporated area nor a census-designated place, all data are for the ZIP code 19035, with which the community is coterminous. There are four churches, a synagogue, a library, two schools, the Gladwyne fire company, the Gladwyne Civic Association, the Stony Lane Swim Club, playgrounds, parks, businesses, and retail shops within the confines of Gladwyne. The historic Guard House Inn is also located within Gladwyne. The village is also home to the Philadelphia Country Club on its periphery, Merion Cricket Club, and to The Courts, a private tennis club. Because the town was early to preserve space and has received many donations of land, developers have not subdivided the area into more typical suburban developments, so the area retains a mixture of farm, colonial town, and late 19th/early 20th housing uncharacteristic of other Main Line communities. Banker James Crosby Brown of Brown Brothers & Co. built a estate that later was divided into non- divisible (deed-restricted) lots of three to , an early act of (partial) preservation that set an important precedent for future acts by both individuals and the township.Bean, Theodore W. The History of Montgomery County, 1884. The Lower Merion Conservancy plays a significant role in protecting the local heritage and maintains its office in Gladwyne's Rolling Hill Park.Lower Merion Conservancy, Internet, www.lmconservancy.org History Like the rest of the region, Gladwyne, known until 1891 as \\"Merion Square\\", originally was settled by Welsh Quakers beginning in 1682. It was given its new name to lessen confusion with the many \\"Merions\\" in the area, including the town of Merion, Lower Merion Township, and Upper Merion Township, and in imitation of the Welsh names of adjoining towns, although its new name was meaningless in Welsh. Twenty-four mills operated along Mill Creek through the beginning of the twentieth century, and the major road through residential Gladwyne runs along the banks of the creek. After the American Civil War and following construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line west from Center City, wealthy Philadelphians located many of their summer homes there. The development of the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) in the 1960s and the subsequent development of King of Prussia as a major business center increased Gladwyne's appeal, as it was the Main Line town situated closest to the Expressway and midway between King of Prussia and Center City Philadelphia. The Gladwyne Elementary School was built in 1958 to accommodate the children of these new residents and the Gladwyne Free Library (part of the Lower Merion Library System) was renovated and expanded as well. Yet the core of the village, built originally at the convergence of Youngsford and Righter's Mill Roads during the latter part of the eighteenth century, remained essentially the same, allowing Gladwyne to retain all of its original historic character and at the same time enjoy the conveniences of modern suburban living, such as a centrally located supermarket with ample parking, pharmacy, tavern, and restaurants.Jones, Dick, ed. The First Three Hundred: The Amazing and Rich History of Lower Merion. Ardmore: The Lower Merion Historical Society, 2001. The Gladwyne Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The sport at the time was new to England, and was used as a means of entertainment for the soldiers stationed in Malta at the various barracks around Malta at the time. In 1863 a football association was formed which governed rules and regulations for this quickly changing sport, which was still in amateur competition stage and played in an un-scheduled format until 1909 when a league format was introduced. The association runs the national football team, as well as administering the semi-professional Maltese Football League and the Maltese Cup for club sides. History The first Maltese championship in the 1909-1910 season was won by Floriana. The league regularly changed in numbers as teams changed administrators, dropped out of the league, and new teams re- entered. Up until the season of 1939-1940 this first league remained the only league in Maltese football, and was called the Maltese division one. Sliema Wanderers and Floriana dominated, winning all but four championships up to 1940. The Maltese football league trophy was implemented in the 1935 season which Sliema Wanderers and Floriana continued to dominate up to the Second World War between them. Unfortunately due to the Second World War, the league had to break-off since many Maltese players were drafted in to the defence of the island during the early 1940s when the Maltese archipelago were heavily involved in the North Africa conflict due to its strategic position in the Mediterranean Sea. Normal league activity resumed in the 1945, after the end of the war with the league format of four teams joining including Sliema Wanderers and Floriana. The Maltese football association league format soon changed however, to a multiple tier format as from the 1946 season. The passing of the North Africa conflict saw the Maltese football associations largest interest with fifteen clubs registering to join the Maltese FA in the 1940s, doubling the size of the number of registered clubs within ten years. Many of today's familiar names joined the league including Valletta and Hibernians. Interest in the Maltese league continued throughout the 1950s, 1960's and 1970s with fifteen more clubs joining the league including Birkirkara FC in 1950 . It was however Hibernians and Valletta who put together a good challenge to Sliema Wanderers and Floriana, winning eight championships between them, and three league trophies. The 1980s saw the monopolization of Sliema Wanderers and Floriana finally come to an end with four different clubs taking most of the honours in this decade. The Inauguration of the new national stadium, Ta' Qali could have been a reason for this, with a large re-structuring of the Maltese league program to coincide with Maltese football's new impressive home. Hibernians F.C. went on to win the Maltese league championship in 1981 and 1982, Rabat Ajax (formed 1930) won in 1985, and 1986, however the real surprise came from one of Malta's oldest clubs, ƒ¶amrun Spartans who won the league three times in 1983, 1987 and 1988, and won a five league trophies. Floriana did win the league trophy in 1981, although unfortunately were relegated to Malta's second league in the season of 1985. The last decades of the century saw the league format expand to its fourth tier, now with fifty clubs registered in the league. A diverse range of clubs now sharing the trophies in the Maltese league's top tier to contribute to an entertaining and high quality semi-professional football league. Valletta enjoyed a golden age in the 1990s winning five championships and four league cups. A re-juvenated Floriana won the championship in 1993, as well as two league cups, and Sliema Wanderers, ƒ¶amrun Spartans and Hibernians also picked up notable honours. At present there are a number of clubs with the resources and capability of winning the championship trophy, which is now called the Maltese Premier League trophy. Birkirkara FC are the notable new force in the Maltese league, after winning their first championship in the year 2000, and the team from Malta's largest town has regularly picked up honours since propelling itself into the history books. Other teams to have made relative impact were ≈ªurrieq in the 1980s and Valletta in the late 1990s. Early league format The first Malta Football Association Premier League (1st Division) 1909-1910 Current system Currently the Maltese national and official system consists of 53 teams within 4 tiers. These are the Maltese Premier League, the Maltese First Division, the Maltese Second Division, and the Maltese Third Division. They are all currently sponsored by the Bank of Valletta. The FA Trophy is a knockout competition for all clubs taking part in league competitions in Malta and Gozo; the winners play the Premier League champions in the Maltese Super Cup. Other competitions Other football competitions run in Malta include: *the women's football league: First Division *the Youth League - Commonly known as the Minors' League *the Maltese Cup known as the F.A Trophy *the Maltese Super Cup - played between the winners of the Maltese League and Cup *the Youth Leagues (not to be confused with the previous one) - organised by the Youth FA for boys aged up to 17 Viewership and attendances In the latest decades, particularly the 1990s the Maltese leagues have not boasted of high attendances except for particular derby matches or league deciders. This has often been attributed to various reasons, including the higher quality of foreign leagues (especially the Italian Serie A and the English Premier League), slow-paced football, low interest, relatively unknown players, lack of professionalism and perceived corruption. This has improved since the promotion of Qormi to the top tier, a team which has had a strong following ever since getting promoted. A phenomenon also occurred in the lowest tier, where Zejtun Corinthians and Naxxar Lions, two sides from relatively large localities, started to push for promotion from the Maltese Third Division during season 2009-10. This ended up in a rivalry between the two teams who boasted stronger squads when compared to the other Third Division teams, thus attracting larger crowds than usual. However attendances remain relatively low in numbers. It is important to note that very few statistics are available. English and Italian rivalries Most Maltese people prefer to watch English and Italian leagues. This traces its beginning to the nation's political past, where in the 1930s a hot political issue was the Language Question, i.e. whether Malta had to adopt either Italian or English as an official language. This created pro-British and pro-Italian factions within the Maltese, virtually halving the population in two. This rivalry now remains subtly in the nation's main political parties, but also in football, where as said before Maltese prefer foreign leagues to the Maltese one. During World Cups Maltese generally side with either the English or the Italians. Popular foreign clubs are mainly English Domestic Treble Winners, Manchester City, Liverpool, Juventus, Milan and Inter. Popular national teams apart from their own are mainly England and Italy, with Brazil in the third place, followed by Germany and the Netherlands to a lesser extent. These foreign fandoms generally divert attention from Maltese football to the detriment of the Maltese leagues and the Malta national football team.

Berceni is also locally known as the place through where the wind comes in Bucharest. Location Geographically, it has a trapezoidal shape, bordered by Oltenitei Road and Turnu Magurele Street in the north and south, respectively. Built during the 1960s, it is a typical Communist-era working class district, lacking any major green spaces or cultural attractions. It has a population of roughly 110,000. Some map would be really useful here. https://www.google.com/maps/place/Berceni,+Bucharest/@44.3862626,26.1020178,14.78z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x40b1fe41c69f7dc9:0x7aa404e0b3338385!8m2!3d44.3892215!4d26.1182032 Etymology It is believed that the name comes from the hussars of Mikl√≥s Bercs√©nyi, who were first mentioned after the suppression of the Hungarian Kuruc War led by Francis II R√°k√≥czi (at beginning of the 18th century). They settled in the neighborhood of Bucharest. Another theory claims that the name comes from an archaic Romanian word for tax collector. History Before the 1960s, Berceni was situated outside of Bucharest, in a very sparsely populated area where only a few rural properties were located, with the nearest landmarks being the long-gone VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Monastery, and starting from the latter half of the 19th century, the Bellu Cemetery. In the interwar era, the Alexandru Obregia hospital was opened. On 5 April 1964, the Sc√Ænteia announced plans for a new housing estate, being built specifically for the workers at the IMGB plant located nearby, which opened in 1963. Construction works began the same year, which brought many Lipovan Russians from the Dobrogea region of Romania, who worked with excavating and laying foundations for the buildings. The first dwellers moved in 1965 when the first apartment buildings (4 to 9 storeys high) were completed, although the housing estate had its shortcomings: the local market was not ready on time, so trucks with food supplies would come in the mornings for the residents. On the other hand, the Lipovans found multiple graves on the construction site of a school. The construction of the 4-storey apartment blocks was done much faster due to the type of the buildings using prefabricated panels, in one of the first large- scale uses of prefabs in apartment blocks. The 9-storey apartment blocks used the more traditional construction methods. 5500 apartments were planned to be built in the first stage: the goal was achieved in 1968, but construction works were completed by around 1976. The buildings closer to Pia»õa Sudului were also built at the same time. The western half of Berceni (located closer to the Giurgiului housing estate) began to be constructed starting from 1971 using more austere 4-storey and 10-storey apartment blocks, being exclusively built with prefabricated panels, the construction of which was completed by 1981. The second stage had fewer green spaces and more buildings that were built closer to each other. A group of small houses was left undemolished, and it still exists today, because, according to the institute that planned this housing estate, it gave the area \\"a special characteristic\\". Berceni also benefitted from a large shopping center (BIG Berceni) which opened in February 1975, various schools and multiple trolleybus routes that opened in the late 1960s. The second line of the Bucharest Metro began operating in the vicinity of the neighborhood starting from 24 January 1986, serving the Pia»õa Sudului and ApƒÉrƒÉtorii Patriei areas, along with the IMGB industrial area; however this led to the trolleybus network of Berceni being isolated from the rest of the trolleybus network of Bucharest in 1987, in an attempt to re-engineer the ground transportation in the city by building district-based networks. In the last stage, multiple apartment blocks were built nearby from 1982 to 1990 in various areas of the housing estate, especially on the Olteni»õei Avenue and Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu Avenue. In the 1980s it was the largest working class housing estate in Southern Bucharest, being one of the main four large scale housing estates built in the 1960s. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the housing estate became infamous for its high crime rates, although this issue has been less common in the last decade. Starting from 2016, a program was launched to rebuild the roads and renovate multiple apartment buildings. Other There is also a village of Berceni, which is situated to the south and is outside Bucharest city limits.

She was the first wife of Emperor Xuan. She was murdered by poisoning by Huo Guang's wife Xian (È°Ø). She was also the mother of Emperor Yuan.  Family background  Xu Pingjun was born into a family that had some minor privileges but had also suffered under the reign of Emperor Wu. It is not known exactly when she was born, but probably circa 89 BC. Her father Xu Guanghan (Ë®±Âª£Êº¢) was an assistant to the Prince of Changyi when young, and later became an imperial attendant. Later, while accompanying Emperor Wu on a trip, he accidentally took the saddle of another attendant and was charged with theft; his sentence was castration. After castration, he became a eunuch at court, and served as a minor official.  Marriage to then-commoner Liu Bingyi  Xu Pingjun's future husband Liu Bingyi was the only surviving descendant of Liu Ju, Emperor Wu's crown prince who was forced into a failed rebellion in 91 BC when he was still an infant. He was spared, but was made a commoner and, as an orphan, he had to survive on the largess of others, including his grandfather's old subordinate Zhang He (ÂºµË≥Ä), who was also castrated by Emperor Wu as punishment for having been Crown Prince Ju's subordinate, and who became a chief eunuch. Around 76 BC, Zhang wanted to marry his granddaughter to Bingyi, but his brother Zhang Anshi (ÂºµÂÆâ‰∏ñ), then an important official, opposed this, fearing that it would bring trouble. Zhang, instead, invited Xu Guanghan, a subordinate to him, to dinner and persuaded him to marry his daughter, Pingjun. When Xu's wife heard this, she became extremely angry and refused, but because Zhang was Xu's superior, Xu did not dare to renege on the promise, and Bingyi and Pingjun were married, in a ceremony entirely paid by Zhang (because Bingyi could not afford to). Zhang also paid the bride price. After their marriage, Bingyi depended on his wife's family for support. In 75 BC, Pingjun bore him a son, Liu Shi.  As empress  In 75 BC, an unexpected development occurred. After the death of Bingyi's granduncle, Emperor Zhao, the regent Huo Guang, having been dissatisfied with his initial selection of Prince He of Changyi as the new Emperor, deposed Prince He and offered the throne to the commoner Bingyi instead. Bingyi accepted and took the throne as Emperor Xuan. After her husband became emperor, Pingjun was initially created an imperial consort. When it came time to create an empress, the officials largely wanted Emperor Xuan to marry Huo Guang's daughter Huo Chengjun and create her empress. Emperor Xuan did not explicitly reject this proposal, but issued an order to seek out the sword that he owned as a commoner. Getting the hint, the officials recommended Consort Xu as empress, and she was created as such late in 74 BC. He initially wanted to create his father-in-law Xu Guanghan a marquess, but Huo opposed this, reasoning a eunuch who had suffered castration as a punishment should not be made a marquess. Instead, Xu was given the title of Lord of Changcheng (ÊòåÊàêÂêõ). As empress, Empress Xu was known for her humility and thriftiness. She was also known for devotion to Grand Empress Dowager Shangguan, often meeting her for meals.  Death  Tomb of Empress Xu Pingjun south of Xi'an, Shaanxi Huo Guang's wife, Lady Xian, would not be denied her wish of making her daughter an empress. In 71 BC, Empress Xu was pregnant when Lady Xian came up with a plot. She bribed Empress Xu's female physician Chunyu Yan (Ê∑≥‰∫éË°ç), under guise of giving Empress Xu medicine after she gave birth, to poison her. Chunyu did so (with aconitum), and Empress Xu died shortly after she gave birth. Her doctors were initially arrested to investigate whether they cared for the empress properly. Lady Xian, alarmed, informed Huo Guang what had actually happened, and Huo, not having the heart to turn in his wife, instead signed Chunyu's release. (It is not known what happened to Empress Xu's newborn child, but since Chinese historical sources at that time did not pay much attention to children who die young, presumably the child died early.) Empress Xu was buried with full imperial honours near, but not with, her husband, whose third wife Empress Wang was later buried with him. Her son Prince Shi would later become crown prince and later Emperor Yuan after surviving attempts on his life by Empress Xu's successor, Empress Huo. The Huo clan would be destroyed in 66 BC.

Anserine can be found in the skeletal muscle and brain of mammals and birds. Due to its presence in lean muscles, like fish and poultry, there have been recent studies showing that anserine's inclusion to our diets can be beneficial for blood clearance and food absorption. These results were based on L-histidine concentrations at different time intervals. A study observing the effect of anserine diet on blood clearance and food absorption concluded that the data showed an ephemeral anserine level peak in blood after consumption of anserine, followed by a prolonged, high level of methylhistidine. This indicates rapid absorption and clearing of anserine because anserine is catabolized into methylhistidine and alanine by enzyme found in blood. Then, a succeeding experiment was laid out to test the difference between the first group of people consuming extracted anserine and the latter consuming natural anserine as found in food. In these two groups, while the concentrations of L-histidine-related compound varied depending on the amount of anserine consumed, the absorption level patterns in blood were congruous, proving that anserine taken in food equally helps rapid absorption of food compared to when extracted anserine is taken alone. In addition, anserine can also be beneficial for patients with Alzheimer's disease. In a recent study including an Alzheimer's model mice, the use of anserine reduced the inflammation of astrocytes, showing that treatment with anserine can improve memory loss. Similarly, to arrive at this conclusion, scientists stained pericytes from mouse and found that anserine treated mouse had greater surface area of cells than those that were not treated with anserine. The greater area of pericyte is commensurate with improved memory because pericyte warp around brain capillary to control blood flow and gate cells from neurotoxin, blocking inflammation. Furthermore, scientists performed Morris Water Maze tests on mouse and found that anserine treated mouse had overall better spatial memory. The effects of anserine and carnosine were also observed in humans; One study done with 84 elders in Tokyo found that elders who took 500mg of anserine and carnonsine for one year showed more blood flow in the prefrontal cortex through the MRI. There has also been study revealing that free N-terminal of histidine on anserine and carnosine protect against zinc-caused neurotoxicity and regulate Arc pathway in which Arc protein is used to produce dendrite protein for connecting nerve cells. The pKa of the imidazole ring of histidine, when contained in anserine, is 7.04, making it an effective buffer at physiologic pH.

Fatal Racing supports graphics resolutions of 320√ó200 and 640√ó480, the latter being very demanding on the hardware available at the time of the game's release. The game also runs in a 16:10 aspect ratio and not the more common 4:3 aspect ratio at the time. The names displayed for drivers of cars in the race not controlled by human players and all come from famous robot or computer characters from science fiction movies and television (Kryten from Red Dwarf, Slave from Blake's 7, Robby from Forbidden Planet, etc.). These names, however, are changeable and can be renamed within the configuration menu in the game. Release Later, there was an enhanced 3dfx Glide version of the game made. This was bundled with some Voodoo Cards as Fatal Racing 3D. This enhanced version is hardware specific, and it requires a Voodoo I graphics card to function correctly. There were also patches available for the original versions of the game to add support for 3D graphics cards such as the Rendition Verite and the S3 ViRGE. Music Fatal Racing has audio CD tracks for a realistic music performance. It can be chosen as a music option in the Sound and Music setup program. This was used to replace low-quality MIDI choices. While the title, race victory, and championship victory tracks are high-quality versions of their respective MIDI equivalents, the menu track and in-game tracks are completely different on the CD. The audio and the sound effects (featuring the 9 songs) were produced by Neil Biggin. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation applauded the game's inventive and challenging tracks, numerous cars to choose from, and network options. He noted that the game's high resolution mode runs poorly even on a Pentium 133, but said the game overall compares favorably to games like The Need for Speed and Screamer, and gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

As of March 2016, the company had 276 theaters with 2,954 screens in 41 states, and was the fourth largest movie theater in the United States. The company billed itself as \\"America's Hometown Theatre\\" and Carmike theaters were largely positioned in rural or suburban areas with populations under 200,000. The company's theaters operated under various names and generally had a name followed by the number of auditoriums at that location; for example, \\"Carmike 15\\". On March 4, 2016, AMC Theatres announced its intent to acquire Carmike Cinemas. The deal was closed on December 21, 2016; the Carmike locations were amalgamated primarily under the brand AMC Classic (which uses Carmike's logo and slogan). History Carmike was founded when Carl L. Patrick, Sr. acquired Martin Theatres from Fuqua Industries in 1982. The company's name was derived from a combination of the first names of Carl L. Patrick, Sr.'s two sons, Carl Jr. and Michael, hence \\"Carmike\\". In 1996, Carmike purchased Fox Theatres Corp. (which had 61 screens in their chain), and Maxi Saver Cinemas (which had 18 screens in their chain), both primarily in Pennsylvania. In 1997, Carmike partnered with Walmart to start the Hollywood Connection, starting with a location in Columbus, Georgia. Amenities include a modern multiplex or megaplex movie theater with 5-15 screens, indoor miniature golf, a roller skating rink, a laser tag arena, and a video game arcade. At the time, Carmike was wanting this field to be extremely profitable. While the Columbus, Georgia location is still open, other locations in West Valley City, Utah (a suburb of Salt Lake City), DeKalb, Illinois, Valparaiso, Indiana (a suburb of Chicago), and Goshen, Indiana have closed. Carmike filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 2000 after failing to make US$9 million in interest payments to bondholders‚Äîthe company owed approximately US$650 million in debt. Since declaring bankruptcy, many theaters (mostly smaller single, twin and triple theatres) in inactive markets were closed down, and some were renovated or relocated in areas with desirable market potential‚Äîmost of these newer theaters are 10 screens or larger. The number of theaters owned or operated by the company dropped from 448 to just over 300. During bankruptcy, the company was forced to sell or close several historic theaters, including the Villa Theatre in Salt Lake City, Utah and the Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, Nebraska, the latter of which contained a wide Cinerama screen, believed to be the largest in the US at the time. The Indian Hills was eventually demolished in August 2001 by its new owners, Methodist Health System, and replaced with a parking lot for the system's nearby hospital and nursing college. Actress Patricia Neal called the destruction of the theater \\"a crime\\" in a letter of support, and letters were also written by Kirk Douglas, Janet Leigh, Robert Wise and film critic Leonard Maltin. Carmike exited bankruptcy in January 2002, having successfully restructured its debts and operations.Adams, Tony (January 21, 2009). \\"Carmike Cinemas board removes CEO Michael Patrick\\". Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. Retrieved on January 26, 2009. A judge approved the Chapter 11 plan, filed in October 2001, which involved payment of US$263 million of Carmike's bank loans. In 2005, Carmike purchased 30 GKC Theaters (263 screens) from the heirs of George Kerasotes for $66 million. The George Kerasotes Corporation was the result of a split with other family members who jointly owned Kerasotes Theatres. In December 2008, Mark Cuban acquired a 9.4 percent stake in Carmike Cinemas and, following a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Cuban explained that his interest was for investment purposes. Carmike Cinemas' board of directors removed Michael Patrick as its chief executive on January 20, 2009. S. David Passman III was selected as the non-executive chairman of the board. The board established an Office of the Chairman as a body that oversaw the company's strategic direction and the transitional period until a new chief executive was employed‚Äîin addition to Passman, the Office of the Chairman consisted of chief operating officer Fred Van Noy and chief financial officer Richard Hare. On June 4, 2009, the company announced that S. David Passman III was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, while board member, Roland C. Smith, succeeded Passman as Carmike's Chairman of the Board. Van Noy and Hare remained in their respective positions. In 2011, Carmike Cinemas acquired MNM Theatres, adding three locations (40 screens) in the Atlanta area. In October 2012, Rave Cinemas, a division of Cinemark Theatres, signed an agreement to sell 16 theaters with 251 screens to Carmike Cinemas for $19 million in cash and $100.4 million of assumed lease obligations. Of the 16 theaters being acquired, six are in Alabama, four in Florida, two in Indiana, and one each in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. This was Carmike's first foray into IMAX. The sale also included 7 IMAX screens. Before the sale Rave owned or managed 62 theaters and 939 screens located in 21 states across the country. On July 18, 2013, Carmike Cinemas announced that they would buy three more theatres from Rave Cinemas located in Louisville, Kentucky; Voorhees, New Jersey; and Hickory Creek, Texas. With this change, the Voorhees and Louisville locations switched to Screenvision from National CineMedia, while Hickory Creek remains with Screenvision. The sale also included an eighth IMAX screen. The sale was closed on August 16, 2013. On November 4, 2013, Carmike Cinemas purchased Muvico Theaters for just under $31.8 million in an acquisition that included Muvico's nine locations in Florida, California and Illinois. Two Bogart's restaurants were also included in the sale and, after the sale closed at the end of 2013, the MuviXL screens was rebranded as \\"Carmike's BigD\\". Carmike's first-ever California location, the Thousand Oaks 14 theater, was obtained in the acquisition. On May 15, 2014, Carmike Cinemas announced their purchase of Digital Cinema Destinations Corp., operating as Digiplex Destinations, in an all-stock transaction. Included in the deal were Digiplex's 21 open locations containing 206 screens, as well as 5 theaters in development with an additional 53 screens. The acquisition introduced Carmike to 4 new states: Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland, and New Hampshire. On October 6, 2015, Carmike Cinemas announced it agreed to acquire the Sundance Group's cinema chain, Sundance Cinemas, for $36 million. On March 3, 2016, AMC Theatres announced its intent to acquire Carmike Cinemas in a $1.1 billion deal, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal was completed on December 21, 2016. With the deal, AMC overtook Regal Entertainment Group as the United States' largest movie theater chain. In February 2017, AMC announced it would discontinue the Carmike name and re-brand all of its locations under the AMC name. Many of the Carmike locations are being operated under the new banner AMC Classic, which denotes smaller, value-focused locations with fewer premium amenities than the AMC and AMC Dine-In banners. Upon the change in banner, some locations also switched formats from second-run to first-run films, whilst maintaining lower ticket prices than competitors. The AMC Classic banner re-purposes Carmike trademarks, including the former company's folded film logo, and its slogan \\"America's Hometown Theatres\\".AMC press release ReferencesExternal links * Official website (archived) * investor website (archived) * Sundance Cinemas Official Site (archived) Category:AMC Theatres Category:Companies based in Columbus, Georgia Category:Defunct companies based in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Entertainment companies established in 1982 Category:Entertainment companies disestablished in 2016 Category:2016 mergers and acquisitions Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Movie theatre chains in the United States Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2000 Category:1982 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2016 disestablishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Carmike Cinemas"},{"id":"2488543","text":"Infamy, in common usage, is the notoriety gained from a negative incident or reputation (as opposed to fame). The word stems from the Latin infamia, antonym of fama (in the sense of \\"good reputation\\"). Roman law In Roman law, it took the form of a censure on individuals pronounced by a competent authority in the state, which censure was the result either of certain actions which they had committed or of certain modes of life which they had pursued. Such a censure involved disqualification for certain rights both in public and in private law. In canon law Infamy is a term of art in Roman Catholic canon law. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913, infamy in the canonical sense is defined as the privation or lessening of one's good name as the result of the bad rating he has, even among prudent men. It constitutes an irregularity, a canonical impediment that prevents one being ordained or exercising such orders as he may have already received. There are two types of infamy: infamy of law (infamia juris) and infamy of fact (infamia facti). =Infamy of law= Infamy of law is contracted in one of three ways. Either the law itself attaches this juridical ineligibility and incapacity to the commission of certain crimes, or makes it contingent upon the decision of a judge, or finally connects it with the penalty imposed by the judge. This kind of infamy is incurred chiefly by those guilty of duelling (whether as principals or seconds), rape (as likewise those who co-operate in it), attempt to marry during the lifetime of the actual consort, heresy, real simony, etc. Infamy of law may be removed either by canonical purging or by application to the Holy See. =Infamy of fact= Infamy of fact is the result of a widespread opinion, by which the community attributes some unusually serious delinquency, such as adultery or the like, to a person. This is more of an unfitness than an irregularity properly so called, unless sentence in court has been pronounced. It ceases therefore when one has shown by a change of life extending over a period of two or probably three years that his repentance is sincere. A crime consisting in acts which society not only forbids but also considers as highly immoral and particularly dishonoring, as defined (variously) in certain legal systems, as in Poland; in its origin, in Ancient Rome, infamia was the mark of disapproval of the censors on moral grounds - often such 'legal immorality' is largely defined according to the state - or de facto dominant religion. In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth infamy (infamia) was a more severe form of exile sentence. A noble who has been sentenced to infamy, known as infamis lost the protection of the law and there was a reward for his death (this was similar to the common law concept of outlawry). In addition, a banished noble (banita) who killed an infamed one could expect his exile sentence to be revoked.

It sought to synthesise liberalism, nationalism and non-Marxist socialism with Protestant Christian values in order to cross the ideological front lines and draw workers away from Marxist class struggle. However, it never grew beyond a minor party of intellectuals which failed to gain mass support in elections..  History  In the second half of the 19th century, Germany underwent a rapid industrialization, which was connected with rising social problems. As a result of this, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was founded and soon outlawed under the first Chancellor of the German Empire Otto von Bismarck. After the party was legalized again in 1890 (the year Bismarck resigned), it enjoyed considerable success at elections. Since the SPD was Marxist, using Karl Marx's Das Kapital for their theoretical underpinnings, the ruling classes considered it a threat. In 1896, Friedrich Naumann, a Protestant parish priest, founded the National-Social Association. The establishment is seen as a reaction to the rise of socialism and an attempt to offer a moderate social liberal alternative guided by Protestant Christian principles as opposed to the atheism of the SPD, to the new masses of the working class. It was influenced by the political theories of Max Weber, who helped founding the party.. In accordance with Weber's teachings, the party believed that working class and bourgeoisie should join hands for a strong German Empire, economic growth and social progress, therefore the party strove to dismantle the ideological divisions between socialists, left and national liberal and Christian parties.. The ideology of the association was labeled by its thought leader first as \\"national socialism on a Christian basis\\" (nationaler Sozialismus auf christlicher Grundlage) and \\"social imperialism\\" (soziales Kaisertum), later as \\"proletarian-bourgeois integral liberalism\\" (proletarisch-b√ºrgerlicher Gesamtliberalismus), meaning a mix of nationalism, Christian socialism and social liberalism. Naumann's party advocated a stronger role for the parliament, but did not question the leading position of the monarch. Publications of the party included the weekly newspaper Die Hilfe (The Help) and the short-lived daily newspaper Die Zeit (The Time). Furthermore, there were a number of regional and local papers who had close ties with the association. In the elections of 1898 and 1903, the candidates of the association failed to gain seats and Naumann dissolved the party, merging into the centrist liberal Free-minded Union. However, the newspaper Die Hilfe outlived the party and continued to advocate Naumann's ideology. Despite its name, the National-Social Association is considered a liberal party and had no relation to the 20th century Nazi Party, except their shared rejection of Marxism and claim to great power status for the German Empire.

Mature red-faced warblers are small birds, long. They are light gray on top with a white rump and a white underside. The face, neck, and upper breast are all bright red, while the crown and sides of the head are black. The spot on the back of the head where the black crown and gray back meet is sometimes speckled gray, or sometimes plain white. They have a quirky habit of flicking their tail sideways while feeding. Red-faced warblers are locally common in mountain forests of conifers and oak at above sea level. In summer they frequent northern Mexico and range up into the states of Arizona and New Mexico - the Madrean sky islands. In winter they migrate south into southern Mexico and the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. They are permanent residents of the central and southern mountains of western Mexico, the range called Sierra Madre Occidental. The nest is a small cup constructed from leaves, grass, and pine needles. It is hidden amongst the debris on the forest floor, buried in the ground, sheltered under a shrub, log, or rock. The female lays 3 to 5 eggs, which are white spotted with brown. Incubation and nestling periods average 12 days each. References * Curson, J., Quinn, D. & Beadle, D. (1994). New World Warblers.

As a technical school * 1923‚Äì1926: Newcastle Junior Technical and Domestic Science School * 1927‚Äì1931: Broadmeadow Junior Technical School * 1932‚Äì1960: Newcastle Central Technical School As a general high school * 1961‚Äì1965: Broadmeadow Boys High School * 1966‚Äì1975: Broadmeadow Boys School * 1976‚Äì1992: Broadmeadow High School (co- educational) As a performing arts school * 1993‚Äì1997: The Broadmeadow School of Performing Arts * 1998‚Äìpresent: Hunter School of the Performing Arts A notable moment in this school's recent history was the June 2007 Hunter Region and Central Coast storms. The Hunter School of the Performing Arts was one of the most severely affected schools in the area. The school suffered a large amount of damage; the entire bottom level was washed away and the school's library was severely affected.  Motto and colours The original motto was \\"Advance\\", which changed after the school became a boys' school in 1932 to Faber est suae quisque fortunae. The motto was changed in 1999 to its English form, \\"Each of us is responsible for our own destiny\\". \\"Performing at Our Best\\" is the motto most commonly used today, taken from the school's vision statement.\\"A Brief History\\" The original colours of the school were those of the 35th Battalion (\\"Newcastle's Own Regiment\\") of World War I, green and brown. In later years it changed to green and white. In 1999, students were given a survey in a bid for them to choose their own school colours; they chose jade, purple and black. To keep a link with the Newcastle colours, the new logo (of the mask, dancer and bass clef) has been incorporated into a shield which also has a ribbon of brown and a ribbon of green. Following the change in the school colours, a new school uniform was introduced in 2000, with options ranging from formal to casual, including performance and sporting wear. In 2001, the school's marching band uniform changed to reflect this as well, formerly being green and gold, and now has a uniform consisting of black, purple and jade.  Music  The school is home to a number of musical ensembles. Two concert bands, three choirs and a \\"senior vocal ensemble\\", string orchestra, two stage bands, a marching show band and percussion ensemble are well known within the school and community and frequently perform at festivals, parades, ceremonies and competitions. Additionally, the school holds a musical every year, alternating leads between the primary and secondary sections of the school. This musical is performed in the theatre built on school grounds in 2007, the Hunter Theatre.  Dance  There are many dance opportunities within the school. Groups participate in a wide range of activities, including 'Star Struck', Schools Spectacular, Hunter Schools Dance Festival and State Dance Festival. There is also a range of dance ensembles, such as hip hop and ballet, and these are audition only. The dance production class gives students an opportunity to do project based learning along with designing projects that the students want.

Early life The son of a chemist, Ib Sch√∏nberg was interested in acting from an early age. He made his debut in 1920 and worked for more than ten years as a stage actor. Career Sch√∏nberg made his screen debut in Benjamin Christensen's 1922 horror/documentary H√§xan. By the 1930s he was an established comic actor, often in main roles as leaders of buffoon duos, well-meaning policemen, or more substantial ‚Äúuncle types‚Äù. During World War II he suddenly appeared as a dramatic actor, and from then until his death he maintained his position as one of the greatest actors of Danish art films, playing serious roles alongside comic roles. He was well known for his ability to perform ‚Äúthe colossus with feet of clay‚Äù, apparently solid and superior characters -- both sympathetic and unsympathetic -- who fall apart by the end of the film. Among his best-known serious performances are his mean-cultivated informer type in Afsporet (1942 - Derailed); his leader af a children‚Äôs home, a sadist with shattered nerves in the social film Kampen mod uretten (1949 - The Struggle Against Injustice) and his two portraits of alcoholics in Ta‚Äô hvad du vil ha‚Äô (1947 ‚Äì Take What You Want) and Caf√© Paradis (1951). In his later years he was a regular participant in the so-called ‚ÄúMorten Korch films‚Äù (based upon the regional novels of a very popular Danish light literate) often placed as the fatherly friend of the hero and his serial role as a widower with children in the popular Far til fire (The Father of Four) films. Apart from a few Swedish movies, Sch√∏nberg made only Danish films. In 1940 he was offered the role of Martin Luther in a Hollywood production, but he turned it down. In 1949, Sch√∏nberg took part in every Danish film of that year and during the last six years of his life (1949-1955) he appeared in almost 60 films. It was a saying about him, that if 10 Danish films were made, he would be in the 11 of them. He was an active public figure, appearing at the opening of exhibitions, and freely providing the press with interviews about his ideas and projects. Sch√∏nberg, with his volatile temper and often transient commitment to projects, felt best suited to working in films rather than theatre. However, he occasionally performed on stage and during his last years he was director of the \\"Circus Revue\\". Death He contracted pneumonia in May 1955 and remained bed-ridden until he died on 24 September 1955. Awards In 1948, Sch√∏nberg won the Bodil Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Oscar Bergholtz in the film Ta' hvad du vil h√° (English title: Take What You Want. He again received the Bodil for Best Supporting Actor in 1951 for the film Caf√© Paradis (Paradise Cafe). Filmography *H√§xan (1922) *Hr.

The name means \\"The Academy of the Great Immortals.\\" Daisen-in was founded by the Zen priest (1464‚Äì1548), and was built between 1509 and 1513.Danielle Elisseeff, Jardins japonais, pg. 62‚Äì63. Daisen-in is noted for its screen paintings and for its kare-sansui, or dry landscape garden. The screen paintings inside the temple and the garden are attributed to S≈çami (died in 1525), a zen monk, ink painter and follower of the sect of the Amida Buddha. He was particularly known for his use of diluted ink to create delicate and nuanced, misty and ethereal landscapes. His work was influenced by the ink landscape paintings of the Song Dynasty in China. According to art historian Miyeko Murase, the work of Soami represents \\"the very essence of the serenity of nature, the sacred ideal of all the zen monks and ink painters of the Muromachi period\\".Miyeko Murase, L'Art du Japon, pg. 201. Rock garden In spite of all the interpretations that were attached to this garden in later centuries, its creation was not primarily related to religious Zen: it is a good example of a Chinese style landscape, done as painting in three dimensions, as was demonstrated by Wybe Kuitert. This author also give a most detailed account of the history of the garden. Though the garden is attributed to monk-painter Soami, there is no written evidence that he was also a gardener. Kuitert suggests that the name \\"Soami\\" may have been used as a euphemism for garden makers who were of the untouchable kawaramono class and not versed in Buddhism.Kuitert, Wybe, (2002). Themes in the History of Japanese Garden Art Hawaii University Press, pg. 95-98. The main garden, is in an L shape, to the northeast of and facing the shoin, the study of the hojo, the residence of the head of the monastery. This part of the garden is a narrow strip just 3.7 meters wide, It contains a miniature landscape similar to a Song Dynasty landscape painting, composed of rocks suggesting mountains and a waterfall, clipped shrubs and trees representing a forest, and raked white gravel representing a river. The \\"river\\" splits into branches, one of which flows into a \\"Middle Sea\\" of raked white gravel and a few rocks; the other flows through a gate to a larger \\"Ocean\\" of white gravel. In the river are several symbolic stones; one resembles a boat moving with the current, and the other resembles the back of a turtle trying to swim upstream. The \\"Ocean\\" has two cone-shaped hills of gravel, suggesting mountains. The \\"Middle Sea\\" and The \\"Ocean\\" Sea are connected by another passage of white gravel west of the building. The \\"Ocean\\" and the \\"Middle Sea\\" are both believed to be later additions to the original garden.Young and Young, The Art of the Japanese Garden, pg. 110. American garden historians David and Michigo Young suggest that the garden may represent a metaphorical journey through life: the waterfall/river/sea may represent youth, maturity, and old age, or the search for wisdom. The rocks in the \\"rivers\\" may suggest obstacles. The \\"Ocean\\" at the end of the voyage may be the return to the eternal at the end of life.Young and Young, The Art of the Japanese Garden, pg. 110. French author Danielle Elisseeff sees the garden as divided into four spaces representing four themes; the first is the waterfall, or the impetuous beginning life; the second is the gate, symbolizing the passages of life. This theme features the stone \\"turtle\\" struggling upstream against the current, and the \\"treasure boat\\" moving downstream with the current: the third is the Middle Sea; and the fourth is the Ocean, the final destination of calm and serenity.Daniele Elisseeff, Jardins japonais, pg. 62 German author Gunter Nitschke gives a similar explanation. He writes that the garden is \\"the life of man in symbolic form.\\" The mountain at the beginning of the garden is Mount Horai, the traditional meeting place of the Eight Immortals in Daoist legends, symbolized by a camellia. He observes that, in the corner of the \\"ocean\\" at the end of the voyage is a single \\"tree of bodhi,\\" the traditional Buddhist symbol of the fig tree under which the Buddha sat when he attained enlightenment. Nitschke writes that the \\"treasure boat\\" stone represents the accumulation of experience during an adult life, and the \\"turtle\\" stone represents futile efforts to return to youth.Nitschke, Le jardin japonais, pg. 92-93, Gallery Image:Daisen-in.JPGDaisen-in, gateway and approach to the temple File:Daisen-in2.jpgZen mountains and \\"waterfall\\" in the garden of Daisen-in File:Daisen-in.jpgGravel \\"river\\" in garden at Daisen-in File:Daisen-in3 (1).jpgGravel \\"Middle Sea\\" of the zen garden at Daisen-in File:Daisen- in3.jpgThe \\"Ocean\\" of the zen garden at Daisen-in ReferencesBibliography *Kuitert, Wybe, (2002).

ORTF setup. It was devised around 1960 at the Office de Radiodiffusion T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise (ORTF) at Radio France. ORTF combines both the volume difference provided as sound arrives on- and off-axis at two cardioid microphones spread to a 110¬∞ angle, as well as the timing difference as sound arrives at the two microphones spaced 17 cm apart. Microphone Techniques for Stereo Recording. Retrieved January 23, 2009. The microphones should be as similar as possible, preferably a frequency-matched pair of an identical type and model. The result is a realistic stereo field that has reasonable compatibility with mono playback. Since the cardioid polar pattern rejects off-axis sound, less of the ambient room characteristics are picked up. This means that the mics can be placed farther away from the sound sources, resulting in a blend that may be more appealing. Further, the availability of purpose-built microphone mounts makes ORTF easy to achieve. As with all microphone arrangements, the spacing and angle can be manually adjusted slightly by ear for the best sound, which may vary depending on room acoustics, source characteristics, and other factors. But this arrangement is defined as it is because it was the result of considerable research and experimentation, and its results are predictable and repeatable. These interchannel differences are not the same as interaural differences, as produced by artificial head recordings. Even the spacing of 17 cm is not strictly based on interaural ear spacing.

It is responsible primarily for removing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions from the genome. The related nucleotide excision repair pathway repairs bulky helix-distorting lesions. BER is important for removing damaged bases that could otherwise cause mutations by mispairing or lead to breaks in DNA during replication. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific damaged or inappropriate bases, forming AP sites. These are then cleaved by an AP endonuclease. The resulting single-strand break can then be processed by either short-patch (where a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch BER (where 2‚Äì10 new nucleotides are synthesized). Lesions processed by BER 8-oxoguanine forms a Hoogsteen base pair with adenine Single bases in DNA can be chemically damaged by a variety of mechanisms, the most common ones being deamination, oxidation, and alkylation. These modifications can affect the ability of the base to hydrogen-bond, resulting in incorrect base-pairing, and, as a consequence, mutations in the DNA. For example, incorporation of adenine across from 8-oxoguanine (right) during DNA replication causes a G:C base pair to be mutated to T:A. Other examples of base lesions repaired by BER include: *Oxidized bases: 8-oxoguanine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG, FapyA) *Alkylated bases: 3-methyladenine, 7-methylguanosine *Deaminated bases: hypoxanthine formed from deamination of adenine. Xanthine formed from deamination of guanine. (Thymidine products following deamination of 5-methylcytosine are more difficult to recognize, but can be repaired by mismatch-specific glycosylases) *Uracil inappropriately incorporated in DNA or formed by deamination of cytosine In addition to base lesions, the downstream steps of BER are also utilized to repair single-strand breaks. The choice between long-patch and short-patch repair The choice between short- and long-patch repair is currently under investigation. Various factors are thought to influence this decision, including the type of lesion, the cell cycle stage, and whether the cell is terminally differentiated or actively dividing. Some lesions, such as oxidized or reduced AP sites, are resistant to pol Œ≤ lyase activity and, therefore, must be processed by long-patch BER. Pathway preference may differ between organisms, as well. While human cells utilize both short- and long-patch BER, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was long thought to lack a short-patch pathway because it does not have homologs of several mammalian short-patch proteins, including pol Œ≤, DNA ligase III, XRCC1, and the kinase domain of PNKP. The recent discovery that the poly-A polymerase Trf4 possesses 5' dRP lyase activity has challenged this view. Proteins involved in base excision repairDNA glycosylases= Uracil DNA glycosylase flips a uracil residue out of the duplex, shown in yellow.DNA glycosylases are responsible for initial recognition of the lesion. They flip the damaged base out of the double helix, as pictured, and cleave the N-glycosidic bond of the damaged base, leaving an AP site. There are two categories of glycosylases: monofunctional and bifunctional. Monofunctional glycosylases have only glycosylase activity, whereas bifunctional glycosylases also possess AP lyase activity. Therefore, bifunctional glycosylases can convert a base lesion into a single-strand break without the need for an AP endonuclease. Œ≤-Elimination of an AP site by a glycosylase-lyase yields a 3' Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated aldehyde adjacent to a 5' phosphate, which differs from the AP endonuclease cleavage product. Some glycosylase-lyases can further perform Œ¥-elimination, which converts the 3' aldehyde to a 3' phosphate. A wide variety of glycosylases have evolved to recognize different damaged bases. Examples of DNA glycosylases include Ogg1, which recognizes 8-oxoguanine, Mag1, which recognizes 3-methyladenine, and UNG, which removes uracil from DNA. =AP endonucleases= The AP endonucleases cleave an AP site to yield a 3' hydroxyl adjacent to a 5' deoxyribosephosphate (dRP). AP endonucleases are divided into two families based on their homology to the ancestral bacterial AP endonucleaes endonuclease IV and exonuclease III. Many eukaryotes have members of both families, including the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which Apn1 is the EndoIV homolog and Apn2 is related to ExoIII. In humans, two AP endonucleases, APE1 and APE2, have been identified. It is a member of the ExoIII family. =End processing enzymes= In order for ligation to occur, a DNA strand break must have a hydroxyl on its 3' end and a phosphate on its 5' end. In humans, polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (PNKP) promotes formation of these ends during BER. This protein has a kinase domain, which phosphorylates 5' hydroxyl ends, and a phosphatase domain, which removes phosphates from 3' ends. Together, these activities ready single-strand breaks with damaged termini for ligation. The AP endonucleases also participate in 3' end processing. Besides opening AP sites, they possess 3' phosphodiesterase activity and can remove a variety of 3' lesions including phosphates, phosphoglycolates, and aldehydes. 3'-Processing must occur before DNA synthesis can initiate because DNA polymerases require a 3' hydroxyl to extend from. =DNA polymerases= Pol Œ≤ is the main human polymerase that catalyzes short-patch BER, with pol Œª able to compensate in its absence. These polymerases are members of the Pol X family and typically insert only a single nucleotide. In addition to polymerase activity, these enzymes have a lyase domain that removes the 5' dRP left behind by AP endonuclease cleavage. During long-patch BER, DNA synthesis is thought to be mediated by pol Œ¥ and pol Œµ along with the processivity factor PCNA, the same polymerases that carry out DNA replication. These polymerases perform displacing synthesis, meaning that the downstream 5' DNA end is \\"displaced\\" to form a flap (see diagram above). Pol Œ≤ can also perform long-patch displacing synthesis and can, therefore, participate in either BER pathway. Long-patch synthesis typically inserts 2-10 new nucleotides. =Flap endonuclease= FEN1 removes the 5' flap generated during long patch BER. This endonuclease shows a strong preference for a long 5' flap adjacent to a 1-nt 3' flap. The yeast homolog of FEN1 is RAD27. In addition to its role in long-patch BER, FEN1 cleaves flaps with a similar structure during Okazaki fragment processing, an important step in lagging strand DNA replication. =DNA ligase= DNA ligase III along with its cofactor XRCC1 catalyzes the nick-sealing step in short-patch BER in humans. DNA ligase I ligates the break in long-patch BER. Links with cancer Defects in a variety of DNA repair pathways lead to cancer predisposition, and BER appears to follow this pattern. Deletion mutations in BER genes have shown to result in a higher mutation rate in a variety of organisms, implying that loss of BER could contribute to the development of cancer. Indeed, somatic mutations in Pol Œ≤ have been found in 30% of human cancers, and some of these mutations lead to transformation when expressed in mouse cells. Mutations in the DNA glycosylase MYH are also known to increase susceptibility to colon cancer. Epigenetic deficiencies in cancers Epigenetic alterations (epimutations) in base excision repair genes have only recently begun to be evaluated in a few cancers, compared to the numerous previous studies of epimutations in genes acting in other DNA repair pathways (such as MLH1 in mismatch repair and MGMT in direct reversal). Some examples of epimutations in base excision repair genes that occur in cancers are summarized below. =MBD4= Hydrolysis of cytosine to uracil MBD4 (methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 4) is a glycosylase employed in an initial step of base excision repair. MBD4 protein binds preferentially to fully methylated CpG sites and to the altered DNA bases at those sites. These altered bases arise from the frequent hydrolysis of cytosine to uracil (see image) and hydrolysis of 5-methylcytosine to thymine, producing G:U and G:T base pairs. If the improper uracils or thymines in these base pairs are not removed before DNA replication, they will cause transition mutations. MBD4 specifically catalyzes the removal of T and U paired with guanine (G) within CpG sites. This is an important repair function since about 1/3 of all intragenic single base pair mutations in human cancers occur in CpG dinucleotides and are the result of G:C to A:T transitions. These transitions comprise the most frequent mutations in human cancer. For example, nearly 50% of somatic mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in colorectal cancer are G:C to A:T transitions within CpG sites. Thus, a decrease in expression of MBD4 could cause an increase in carcinogenic mutations. MBD4 expression is reduced in almost all colorectal neoplasms due to methylation of the promoter region of MBD4. Also MBD4 is deficient due to mutation in about 4% of colorectal cancers. A majority of histologically normal fields surrounding neoplastic growths (adenomas and colon cancers) in the colon also show reduced MBD4 mRNA expression (a field defect) compared to histologically normal tissue from individuals who never had a colonic neoplasm. This finding suggests that epigenetic silencing of MBD4 is an early step in colorectal carcinogenesis. In a Chinese population that was evaluated, the MBD4 Glu346Lys polymorphism was associated with about a 50% reduced risk of cervical cancer, suggesting that alterations in MBD4 may be important in cancer. =NEIL1= NEIL1 recognizes (targets) and removes certain oxidatively-damaged bases and then incises the abasic site via Œ≤,Œ¥ elimination, leaving 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ phosphate ends. NEIL1 recognizes oxidized pyrimidines, formamidopyrimidines, thymine residues oxidized at the methyl group, and both stereoisomers of thymine glycol. The best substrates for human NEIL1 appear to be the hydantoin lesions, guanidinohydantoin, and spiroiminodihydantoin that are further oxidation products of 8-oxoG. NEIL1 is also capable of removing lesions from single-stranded DNA as well as from bubble and forked DNA structures. A deficiency in NEIL1 causes increased mutagenesis at the site of an 8-oxo-Gua:C pair, with most mutations being G:C to T:A transversions. A study in 2004 found that 46% of primary gastric cancers had reduced expression of NEIL1 mRNA, though the mechanism of reduction was not known. This study also found that 4% of gastric cancers had mutations in NEIL1. The authors suggested that low NEIL1 activity arising from reduced expression and/or mutation in NEIL1 was often involved in gastric carcinogenesis. A screen of 145 DNA repair genes for aberrant promoter methylation was performed on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissues from 20 patients and from head and neck mucosa samples from 5 non- cancer patients. This screen showed that NEIL1, with substantially increased hypermethylation, had the most significantly different frequency of methylation. Furthermore, the hypermethylation corresponded to a decrease in NEIL1 mRNA expression. Further work with 135 tumor and 38 normal tissues also showed that 71% of HNSCC tissue samples had elevated NEIL1 promoter methylation. When 8 DNA repair genes were evaluated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors, 42% were hypermethylated in the NEIL1 promoter region. This was the most frequent DNA repair abnormality found among the 8 DNA repair genes tested. NEIL1 was also one of six DNA repair genes found to be hypermethylated in their promoter regions in colorectal cancer. Links with cognition Demethylation of 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA. As reviewed in 2018, 5mC is oxidized by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases (TET1, TET2, TET3) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). In successive steps TET enzymes further hydroxylate 5hmC to generate 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) recognizes the intermediate bases 5fC and 5caC and excises the glycosidic bond resulting in an apyrimidinic site (AP site). In an alternative oxidative deamination pathway, 5hmC can be oxidatively deaminated by activity- induced cytidine deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex (AID/APOBEC) deaminases to form 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5mC can be converted to thymine (Thy). 5hmU can be cleaved by TDG, single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (SMUG1), Nei-Like DNA Glycosylase 1 (NEIL1), or methyl-CpG binding protein 4 (MBD4). AP sites and T:G mismatches are then repaired by base excision repair (BER) enzymes to yield cytosine (Cyt). Active DNA methylation and demethylation is required for the cognition process of memory formation and maintenance. In rats, contextual fear conditioning can trigger life-long memory for the event with a single trial, and methylation changes appear to be correlated with triggering particularly long-lived memories. With contextual fear conditioning, after 24 hours, DNA isolated from the rat brain hippocampus region had 2097 differentially methylated genes, with a proportion being demethylated. As reviewed by Bayraktar and Kreutz, DNA demethylation is dependent on base excision repair (see figure). Physical exercise has well established beneficial effects on learning and memory (see Neurobiological effects of physical exercise). BDNF is a particularly important regulator of learning and memory. As reviewed by Fernandes et al., in rats, exercise enhances the hippocampus expression of the gene Bdnf, which has an essential role in memory formation. Enhanced expression of Bdnf occurs through demethylation of its CpG island promoter at exon IV and demethylation depends on base excision repair (see figure). Decline in BER with age The activity of the DNA glycosylase that removes methylated bases in human leukocytes declines with age. The reduction in the excision of methylated bases from DNA suggests an age-dependent decline in 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, a BER enzyme responsible for removing alkylated bases. Young rats (4- to 5 months old), but not old rats (24- to 28 months old), have the ability to induce DNA polymerase beta and AP endonuclease in response to oxidative damage.

Before the Croatian War of Independence the Baroque town was a prosperous, mixed community of Croats, Serbs and other ethnic groups. As Yugoslavia began to break up, Serbia's President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and Croatia's President Franjo Tuƒëman began pursuing nationalist politics. In 1990, an armed insurrection was started by Croatian Serb militias, supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups, who seized control of Serb-populated areas of Croatia. The JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion, and conflict broke out in the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia in May 1991. In August, the JNA launched a full- scale attack against Croatian-held territory in eastern Slavonia, including Vukovar. Vukovar was defended by around 1,800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) and civilian volunteers, against as many as 36,000 JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery. During the battle, shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12,000 a day. At the time, it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945, and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War.Borger, 2011 When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991, several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 20,000 inhabitants were expelled.Prosecutor v. Milosevic, 23 October 2002 Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non-Serb population and became part of the self- declared proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina. Several Serb military and political officials, including Milo≈°eviƒá, were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle. The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia with the signing of the Erdut Agreement. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity. Background View of Vukovar from the Danube in 1917 Vukovar is an important regional centre on Croatia's eastern border, situated in eastern Slavonia on the west bank of the Danube river. The area has a diverse population of Croats, Serbs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Ruthenians and many other nationalities, who had lived together for centuries in relative harmony before the Croatian War of Independence. It was also one of the wealthiest areas of Yugoslavia before the conflict.Prosecutor v. Mrk≈°iƒá, Radiƒá & ≈†ljivanƒçanin ‚Äì Judgement, 27 September 2007, p. 8. Vukovar's long-standing prosperity was reflected in one of Croatia's finest ensembles of Baroque architecture. The region underwent major demographic changes following the Second World War, when its ethnic German inhabitants were expelled and replaced with settlers from elsewhere in Yugoslavia. In 1991, the last Yugoslav census recorded the Vukovar municipality, which included the town and surrounding villages, as having 84,189 inhabitants, of whom 43.8 percent were Croats, 37.5 percent were Serbs and the remainder were members of other ethnic groups. The town's population was 47 percent Croat and 32.3 percent Serb. From 1945, Yugoslavia was governed as a federal socialist state comprising six newly created republics ‚Äì Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia.BBC News, 28 January 2003 The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a Serb majority to the Socialist Republic of Serbia and those with a Croat majority to the Socialist Republic of Croatia. Nevertheless, a sizable Serb minority remained within the latter. Following the death of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980, long- suppressed ethnic nationalism revived and the individual republics began to assert their authority more strongly as the federal government weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro- independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) of Franjo Tuƒëman took power, with Tuƒëman as president. Tuƒëman's programme was opposed by many members of Croatia's Serb minority, towards whom he was overtly antagonistic. Croatia's Serb Democratic Party (SDS), supported by Milo≈°eviƒá, denounced the HDZ as a reincarnation of the nationalist-fascist Usta≈°e movement, which had massacred hundreds of thousands of Serbs during the Second World War.Bassiouni, Annex IV. 28 December 1994 From mid-1990, the SDS mounted an armed rebellion in Serb- inhabited areas of Croatia and set up the self-declared Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina, with covert support from the Serbian government and Serbian paramilitary groups. The Croatian government rapidly lost control of large swathes of the republic. In February 1991, the Krajina Serbs declared independence from Croatia and announced that they would unite with Serbia. Other Serb communities in Croatia also announced that they would secede and established their own militias. Prelude to the battle The conflict between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary group led by Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar.Bassiouni, Annex III. 28 December 1994 In mid-April 1991, an incident occurred in the outskirts of Borovo Selo when three Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired on Serb positions. There were allegations that Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, at the time the Deputy Minister of Defence, led the attack. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. One Serb paramilitary was also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War.Stefanovic, 4 May 1991 It enraged many Croatians and led to a surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia. A Serbian paramilitary patrolling in Erdut, eastern Slavonia, 1991. Shortly after, Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units moved into Borovo Selo. The army's intervention was welcomed by local Croatian leaders, but Croatia's Deputy Interior Minister, Milan Brezak, accused the JNA of preventing the Croatian police from dealing with the paramilitaries.Tanner, 3 May 1991Sudetic, 27 August 1991 Gun battles broke out across the region between rival militias. In Vukovar, Croatians harassed Serb residents, sometimes violently. Croatian police forcibly took over the local radio station, Radio Vukovar, and Serb members of the station's ethnically mixed staff were fired and replaced with Croats. Serb militias systematically blocked transport routes in the predominantly Serb-inhabited countryside around Vukovar, and within days the town could only be reached by an unpaved track running through Croat-inhabited villages. The atmosphere in Vukovar was said to be \\"murderous\\".Tanner, 6 May 1991 On 19 May 1991, the Croatian government held a nationwide referendum on a declaration of sovereignty. In Vukovar, as elsewhere in Croatia, hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott the referendum, while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence. Many local Serbs did vote.Tanner, 20 May 1991 The referendum passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour.Sudetic, 20 May 1991 Violence in and around Vukovar worsened after the independence referendum. Repeated gun and bomb attacks were reported in the town and surrounding villages.Stankovic, 20 June 1991 Sporadic shelling of the city started in June, and increased in intensity throughout the summer. Borovo Naselje, the Croatian-held northern suburb of Vukovar, sustained a significant shelling on 4 July.Prosecutor v. Mrk≈°iƒá, Radiƒá & ≈†ljivanƒçanin ‚Äì Judgement, 27 September 2007, pp. 12‚Äì13. Serb paramilitaries expelled thousands of non-Serbs from their homes in the municipality.BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, 9 July 1991 Croatian paramilitaries, led by Tomislav Merƒçep, attacked Serbs in and around Vukovar. Between 30 and 86 Serbs disappeared or were killed, and thousands of others fled their homes.Jeliniƒá, 31 July 2006 A Croatian government representative in Vukovar told the Zagreb authorities that \\"the city is again [the] victim of terror, armed strife and provocative shoot-outs with potentially unfathomable consequences. The policy pursued so far has created an atmosphere of terror among the Croatian and Serbian population.\\" Gunmen from both sides burned and looted hundreds of houses and farms in the area.Lekic, 24 July 1991 The conflict blurred ethnic lines. Many Serbs who had lived in Vukovar for generations ‚Äì known as the starosedioci or \\"old settlers\\" ‚Äì resisted the propaganda coming from Belgrade and Knin and continued to live peacefully with their Croatian neighbours. The do≈°ljaci, or \\"newcomers\\", whose families had relocated from southern Serbia and Montenegro to replace the deported Germans after 1945, were the most responsive to nationalist appeals. The journalist Paolo Rumiz describes how they \\"tried to win their coethnics over to the patriotic mobilization, and when they had no success with that, they killed them, plundered their property and goods, or drove them away. The old settlers would not let themselves be stirred up against other nationalities.\\" When Croats fled the fighting they often gave their house keys for safekeeping to their Serb neighbours, whom they trusted, rather than to the Croatian police. The political scientist Sabrina P. Ramet notes that a distinctive feature of the war in eastern Slavonia was \\"the mobilization of those who were not integrated into the multi-cultural life of the cities against urban multi-culturalism.\\" Former Belgrade mayor Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá characterised the attack on Vukovar as an act of urbicide, a deliberate assault on urbanism. Opposing forces alt=Map of Vukovar and the surrounding area By the end of July 1991, an improvised Croatian defence force in Vukovar was almost surrounded by Serbian militias in the neighbouring villages. Paramilitaries, JNA soldiers and Serbian Territorial Defence (TO) conscripts were present in Serb-inhabited areas. There was a small JNA barracks in Vukovar's Sajmi≈°te district, surrounded by Croatian-controlled territory.Prosecutor v. Mrk≈°iƒá, Radiƒá & ≈†ljivanƒçanin ‚Äì Judgement, 27 September 2007, p. 14. Although the two sides were commonly referred to as \\"Croatian\\" and \\"Serbian\\" or \\"Yugoslav\\", Serbs and Croats as well as many other of Yugoslavia's national groups fought on both sides. The first commander of the attacking force was Macedonian. Serbs and members of other ethnicities made up a substantial portion of the Croatian defenders. =Croatian forces= The Croatian force in Vukovar comprised 1,800 men assembled from units of the newly created Croatian National Guard, including 400 members of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 1st Guards Brigade. The 4th Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade was stationed in the city from the beginning, while elements of the 1st Guards Brigade arrived retreating from elsewhere in western Syrmia. In addition to the guardsmen there were 300 police officers and 1,100 civilian volunteers from Vukovar and nearby communities. The bulk of the force had initially been organised in an improvised manner. In late September 1991, it was formally reorganised as the 204th Vukovar Brigade, also known as the 124th Brigade. Volunteers arrived from other parts of Croatia, including 58 members of the far-right paramilitary Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), backed by Dobroslav Paraga's extreme nationalist Croatian Party of Rights (HSP). The defenders were a cross-section of Vukovar society. As many as one-third were non-Croats, including Serbs, Ruthenians, Hungarians and members of other ethnicities. About 100 of the defenders were Serbs. \\"We had complete confidence in them,\\" one Croatian veteran later remarked. \\"They defended Vukovar alongside us.\\"Slobodna Dalmacija, 26 September 2009 Croatian forces in Vukovar were commanded by Mile Dedakoviƒá, a former JNA officer who had joined the ZNG and volunteered to take charge of the town's defences. During the battle, he went by the nom de guerre Jastreb (\\"Hawk\\"). Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, by now Croatia's Minister of Defence, used Dedakoviƒá as an example of how Serbs were also taking part in Vukovar's defence.Butkoviƒá, 2010 The claim was later reprinted by independent sources, but was false. Dedakoviƒá's second-in- command, Branko Borkoviƒá, was another former JNA officer who had volunteered for service in Vukovar. The two men established a unified command structure, organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system. A defensive ring of six sectors was established, each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade. The defenders used a network of cellars, canals, ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed. At the start of the battle, they were poorly armed and many were equipped only with hunting rifles. They relied mostly on light infantry weapons, but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines.Prosecutor v. Mrk≈°iƒá, Radiƒá & ≈†ljivanƒçanin ‚Äì Judgement, 27 September 2007, p. 16. They also obtained several hundred anti-tank weapons such as M79 and M80 rocket launchers, but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle. The capture of JNA barracks somewhat improved the situation as Vukovar had the priority in the supply of arms. It is estimated that the Vukovar battlefield consumed around 55‚Äì60 percent of all ammunition available to the Croatian forces. =Yugoslav and Serb forces= Fighter aircraft, such as this Soko G-4 Super Galeb, were used in the battle by the Yugoslav Air Force. The attacking force included JNA soldiers conscripted from across Yugoslavia, members of the TO, Chetniks (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force. At their peak, the Yugoslav and Serb forces in the vicinity of Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube. Although the battle was fought primarily by the federal Yugoslav military, the government of Serbia was directly involved. The Serbian secret police agency, the SDB, took part in military operations, and some of its officers commanded Serbian TO units fighting in Vukovar. Serbia's Ministry of Internal Affairs directed the activities of the paramilitaries. It was also responsible for arming and equipping them. Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá was later accused of direct involvement. According to Veselin ≈†ljivanƒçanin, who was later convicted of war crimes committed at Vukovar, the order to shell Vukovar came \\"from Dedinje\\" ‚Äì the elite Belgrade quarter where Milo≈°eviƒá lived. The JNA's strategic offensive plan in Croatia, 1991. The plan was abandoned after the Battle of Vukovar exhausted the JNA's ability to prosecute the war further into Croatia. At the start of the war in Slovenia, the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal, communist Yugoslavia, rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism. Its head, General Veljko Kadijeviƒá, the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist, initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army's neutrality in the Serb-Croat conflict. The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb- inhabited inland regions, almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia. It aimed to force Croatia's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia. The JNA's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs, and these early goals reflected the Yugoslav outlook of its multiethnic leadership. Kadijeviƒá was half-Croat and half-Serb, his deputy was a Slovene, the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian, and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force, which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle, was a Croat. The loss of Slovenia in the Ten-Day War made it impossible to fulfil the original objective of keeping Yugoslavia intact. Many of the Serb members of the army no longer wanted to fight for a multiethnic Yugoslavia. The army developed an increasingly Serbian character as non-Serbs deserted or refused to be drafted. Some JNA commanders overtly supported the Serb rebels in Croatia and provided them with weapons. Although Kadijeviƒá and other senior JNA commanders initially argued that \\"the JNA must defend all the nations of Yugoslavia\\", they eventually recognised that they had no chance of achieving their original goals, and threw their support behind the rebel Serbs of Croatia. Yugoslav and Serb propaganda portrayed Croatian separatists as genocidal Usta≈°e, who had illegally taken over Yugoslav territory and were threatening Serb civilians in a reprise of the anti-Serb pogroms of the Second World War. Kadijeviƒá later justified the JNA's offensive against Vukovar on the grounds that it was part of the \\"backbone of the Croatian army\\" and had to be \\"liberated\\". The JNA's periodical Narodna Armija claimed after the battle that Vukovar \\"had for decades been prepared to support German military penetration down the Danube.\\" ≈†e≈°elj declared: \\"We're all one army. This war is a great test for Serbs. Those who pass the test will become winners. Deserters cannot go unpunished. Not a single Usta≈°a must leave Vukovar alive.\\" Phase I, August to September 1991 Map of military operations in eastern Slavonia between September 1991 and January 1992. The front line at the end of the campaign was to remain the border between Croatian and Serb-held territory until January 1998. The Battle of Vukovar took place in two phases over about 90 days: from August to September 1991, before the town was fully surrounded, and from early October to mid-November, when the town was encircled then taken by the JNA. Starting in June, Vukovar and neighbouring villages were subjected to daily or near-daily artillery and mortar fire. In July, the JNA and TO began deploying in large numbers across eastern Slavonia, surrounding Vukovar from three sides. Heavy fighting began at the end of August. On 23 August, Borovo Naselje came under heavy shellfire, and Croatian forces shot down two Yugoslav G-2 Galeb fighter aircraft using shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles. The following day, the JNA, the Yugoslav Air Force and the Yugoslav Navy launched a major attack using aircraft, naval vessels on the Danube, tanks and artillery. The attack, which was mounted from both sides of the border, caused extensive damage and resulted in many civilian casualties. On 14 September, the Croatian government ordered an attack against all JNA garrisons and arms depots in the country, an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks was among those attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line. The JNA responded by launching a major offensive in eastern Slavonia, from where it intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb. The JNA did not bypass Vukovar because its leadership wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines. The JNA did not intend to make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive, but as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War, an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides. On 19 September, a JNA force consisting of at least 100 T-55 and M-84 tanks with armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery pieces left Belgrade. It crossed into Croatia near the Serbian town of ≈†id on 20 September. The Croatians were quickly routed and fell back to Vukovar. The JNA's 1st Guards Mechanised Brigade soon reached the Vukovar barracks and lifted the Croatian siege of the facility. They also moved to encircle Vukovar. By 30 September, the town was almost completely surrounded. All roads in and out were blocked, and the only route in was via a farm track through a perilously exposed cornfield. The JNA launched repeated assaults on Vukovar but failed to make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry was lacking, and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little understanding of how to conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground. Croatian forces countered the JNA's attacks by mining approach roads, sending out mobile teams equipped with anti-tank weapons, deploying many snipers, and fighting back from heavily fortified positions. The JNA initially relied on massing armoured spearheads which would advance along a street in a column followed by a few companies of infantry. The Croatians responded by opening fire with anti-tank weapons at very close range ‚Äì often as short as ‚Äì to disable the lead and rear vehicles, trapping the rest of the column, where it could be systematically disabled. They tried to avoid completely destroying the JNA's armour, as the materiel they retrieved from disabled vehicles was an important source of resupply. The Croatians employed a strategy of \\"active defence\\", carrying out hit-and-run attacks to keep the JNA off balance. Anti-tank and anti-personnel mines hindered JNA manoeuvres. Unconventional tactics were used to undermine the JNA's morale, such as firing weather rockets and sabotaging JNA tanks by planting mines underneath them while they were parked at night, causing them to explode when their crews started them in the morning. JNA casualties were heavy. On one road, dubbed the \\"tank graveyard\\", about a hundred JNA armoured vehicles were destroyed, fifteen of them by Colonel Marko Babiƒá.Jutarnji list, 6 July 2007 The high casualties had a debilitating effect on morale all the way up the chain of command. The JNA began launching artillery and rocket barrages against the town. By the end of the battle, over 700,000 shells and other missiles had been fired at Vukovar at a rate of up to 12,000 a day. It is estimated that Vukovar as well as its surroundings were bombarded with more than 2.5 million shells over .Bell, 11 September 2011, 05:06 Metre for metre, the bombardment was more intense than at Stalingrad. The thousands of civilians remaining in Vukovar took shelter in cellars and bomb shelters that had been built during the Cold War. =JNA weaknesses and adoption of new tactics= M-84 tank disabled by a mine laid by the defenders of Vukovar in November 1991. The JNA's lack of infantry support was due to a disastrously low level of mobilisation in the preceding months. Many reservists ‚Äì who were drawn from all the Yugoslav republics, including Croatia ‚Äì refused to report for duty, and many serving soldiers deserted rather than fight. Serbia was never formally at war and no general mobilisation was carried out. An estimated 150,000 Serbs went abroad to avoid conscription, and many others deserted or went into hiding. Only 13 percent of conscripts reported for duty. Another 40,000 staged rebellions in towns across Serbia; the Serbian newspaper Vreme commented in July 1991 that the situation was one of \\"total military disintegration\\". Morale on the battlefield was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know who was willing to fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two. One conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, \\"abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon.\\" In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir ≈Ωivkoviƒá, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that \\"we are not traitors, but we do not want to be aggressors.\\" In late September, Lieutenant Colonel General ≈Ωivota Paniƒá was put in charge of the operation against Vukovar. He established new headquarters and command-and-control arrangements to resolve the disorganisation that had hindered the JNA's operations. Paniƒá divided the JNA forces into Northern and Southern Areas of Responsibility (AORs). The northern AOR was assigned to Major General Mladen Bratiƒá, while Colonel Mile Mrk≈°iƒá was given charge of the south. As well as fresh troops, paramilitary volunteers from Serbia were brought in. They were well armed and highly motivated but often undisciplined and brutal. They were formed into units of company and battalion size as substitutes for the missing reservists. The commander of the Novi Sad corps was videotaped after the battle praising the Serb Volunteer Guard (\\"Tigers\\") of ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá, known as \\"Arkan\\": Paniƒá combined well-motivated paramilitary infantry with trained engineering units to clear mines and defensive positions, supported by heavy armour and artillery. The paramilitaries spearheaded a fresh offensive that began on 30 September. The assault succeeded in cutting the Croatian supply route to Vukovar when the village of Marinci, on the route out of the town, was captured on 1 October. Shortly afterwards, the Croatian 204th Brigade's commander, Mile Dedakoviƒá, broke out with a small escort, slipping through the Serbian lines to reach the Croatian-held town of Vinkovci. His deputy, Branko Borkoviƒá, took over command of Vukovar's defences. General Anton Tus, commander of the Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter, put Dedakoviƒá in charge of a breakthrough operation to relieve the town and launched a counter-offensive on 13 October. Around 800 soldiers and 10 tanks were engaged in the attack, which began in the early morning with artillery preparation. Special police forces entered Marinci before noon, but had to retreat as they did not have enough strength to hold their positions. Croatian tanks and infantry encountered heavy resistance from the JNA and were halted at Nu≈°tar by artillery fire. The JNA's 252nd Armoured Brigade inflicted heavy losses on the Croatian forces and around 13:00 the attack was stopped by the HV General Staff. A humanitarian convoy of the Red Cross was let through to Vukovar. Phase II, October to November 1991 alt=Map of the final phase of the battle, showing arrows driving into a narrow corridor and pushing back a defensive perimeter around the town During the battle's final phase, Vukovar's remaining inhabitants, including several thousand Serbs, took refuge in cellars and communal bomb shelters, which housed up to 700 people each. A crisis committee was established, operating from a nuclear bunker beneath the municipal hospital. The committee assumed control of the town's management and organised the delivery of food, water and medical supplies. It kept the number of civilians on the streets to a minimum and ensured that each shelter was guarded and had at least one doctor and nurse assigned to it. Vukovar's hospital had to deal with hundreds of injuries. In the second half of September, the number of wounded reached between 16 and 80 per day, three- quarters of them civilians. Even though it was marked with the Red Cross symbol, the hospital was struck by over 800 shells during the battle. Much of the building was wrecked, and the staff and patients had to relocate to underground service corridors. The intensive care unit was moved into the building's nuclear bomb shelter. On 4 October, the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the hospital, destroying its operating theatre. One bomb fell through several floors, failed to explode and landed on the foot of a wounded man, without injuring him. Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An-2 biplanes to parachute supplies to Vukovar. The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel cans and boilers filled with explosive and metal bars. The crews used GPS to locate their targets, then pushed the ordnance through the side door. The European Community attempted to provide humanitarian aid to the 12,000 civilians trapped within the perimeter, but only one aid convoy made it through. On 12 October, the Croatians suspended military action to allow the convoy to pass, but the JNA used the pause as cover to make further military gains. Once the convoy set off, the JNA delayed it for two days and used the time to lay mines, bring in reinforcements and consolidate JNA control of the road out of Vukovar. When the convoy arrived, it delivered medical supplies to Vukovar's hospital and evacuated 114 wounded civilians. On 16 October, the JNA mounted a major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became bogged down in the face of determined Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using tear gas and smoke bombs to drive out those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. On 2 November, the JNA reached the strategic suburb of Lu≈æac, between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar, cutting one of the two roads linking the town centre with its northern suburb. Meanwhile, the ZNG (which had been renamed the Croatian Army) attempted to retake the villages of Marinci and Ceriƒá to reopen the supply route to Vukovar. It mounted a heavy bombardment of the JNA's access routes to Vukovar and launched a tank attack on the JNA's lines. On 4 November, JNA General Mladen Bratiƒá was killed when his tank was hit by a shell. The JNA's advantage in artillery and rockets enabled it to halt the Croatian advance and inflict heavy casualties. =Fall of Vukovar= alt=A concrete ceiling with a large hole punched through, exposing the reinforcing metal rods embedded in the concrete JNA troops launched an amphibious assault across the Danube north of Lu≈æac on 3 November to link up with Arkan's paramilitary \\"Tigers\\". This attack split the Croatian perimeter in half and divided the main group of defenders in the town centre from a smaller stronghold in Borovo Naselje. The JNA's Operational Group South began systematically clearing the town centre, cutting off the remaining Croatian soldiers. They captured a key hilltop, Milova Brda, on 9 November, giving them a clear view of the town. The assault was spearheaded by paramilitary troops, with JNA and TO soldiers providing support, especially in demining operations and close artillery support. The Croatian-held village of Bogdanovci, just west of Vukovar, fell on 10 November. As many as 87 Croat civilians were killed following its capture.Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), 3 February 2015, p. 77 On 13 November, the JNA cut the last link between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter mounted a last-ditch attempt to break the siege by attacking from the village of Nu≈°tar, but were repelled by the JNA once again. By now, the Croatians were running out of ammunition and were exhausted from fighting around the clock without any prospect of relief. They had been reduced to three separate pockets. With defeat now inevitable, several hundred Croatian soldiers and civilians attempted to break out over the course of several days, as the JNA mounted its final offensive. Most of those in Borovo Naselje were unable to do so and were killed. On 18 November, the last Croatian soldiers in Vukovar's town centre surrendered. By 18 November, many of Vukovar's civilian inhabitants were living in squalid conditions and nearing starvation. One woman told UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance that she had spent the two previous months in a bomb shelter with her five children without toilets or water for washing. They lived on two slices of bread and a piece of p√¢t√© per day.Champion, 20 November 1991 One of the Croatian soldiers described conditions as the battle reached its peak: When the battle ended, the scale of the town's destruction shocked many who had not left their shelters in weeks. Sini≈°a Glava≈°eviƒá, a reporter for Croatian Radio and a native of Vukovar, who had stayed in the town throughout the battle, described the scene as the survivors emerged: alt=A street of ruined buildings with rubble strewn across the road. A red tractor and other vehicles are visible parked in the background Although active combat had ended in central Vukovar by 18 November, sporadic fighting continued for several days elsewhere in the town. Some Croatian soldiers continued to resist until 20 November and a few managed to slip away from Borovo Naselje as late as 23 November.Nazor, November 2008 Foreign journalists and international monitors entered the town soon after the surrender and recorded what they saw. Blaine Harden of The Washington Post' wrote: Chuck Sudetic of The New York Times reported: Laura Silber and the BBC's Allan Little described how \\"corpses of people and animals littered the streets. Grisly skeletons of buildings still burned, barely a square inch had escaped damage. Serbian volunteers, wild- eyed, roared down the streets, their pockets full of looted treasures.\\" The JNA celebrated its victory, as Marc Champion of The Independent described: Casualties Croatia suffered heavy military and civilian casualties. The Croatian side initially reported 1,798 killed in the siege, both soldiers and civilians. Croatian general Anton Tus later stated that about 1,100 Croatian soldiers were killed, and 2,600 soldiers and civilians were listed as missing. Another 1,000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek, according to Tus. He noted that the fighting was so intense that losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties from that year. According to figures published in 2006 by the Croatian Ministry of Defence, 879 Croatian soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar.Virski list, November 2008 The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) estimates Croatian casualties at around 4,000‚Äì5,000 dead across eastern Slavonia as a whole. The 204th Vukovar Brigade lost over 60 percent of its strength in the battle. The CIA reports that 1,131 civilians were killed over the course of the fighting. Among the dead were 86 children. According to Croatian officials, in eastern Slavonia, 2,000 Croatians were killed, 800 went missing, 3,000 were taken prisoner and 42,852 were made refugees by the end of 1991. Although JNA losses were undoubtedly substantial, the exact numbers are unclear because of a lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. The military historian Norman Cigar contends that the actual number may have been considerably greater as casualties were consistently under-reported during the war. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons, as well as over 20 aircraft. Serbian sources disagree with this assessment. Following the war, Colonel Milisav Sekuliƒá said that the battle resulted in the deaths of 1,180 JNA soldiers and TO personnel. General Andrija Biorƒçeviƒá, the former commander of the Novi Sad corps, remarked that there were \\"[not] more than 1,500 killed on our side.\\"Sikavica, 28 November 1997 This sentiment was echoed by JNA General ≈Ωivota Paniƒá, who shared a similar figure.Vreme, 25 October 2001 In 1997, the journalist Miroslav Lazanski, who has close ties to the Serbian military, wrote in the Belgrade newspaper Veƒçernje novosti that \\"on the side of the JNA, Territorial Defence and volunteer units, exactly 1,103 members were killed.\\" He cited losses of 110 armoured vehicles and two combat aircraft shot down, plus another destroyed due to technical failure. At the time, Lazanski's assessment was endorsed by three retired JNA generals. According to Croatian Serb sources, 350 Vukovar Serbs perished in the battle, including 203 TO fighters and 147 civilians. War crimes alt=View of a long red-roofed farm building surrounded by overgrown ground at the side of a muddy road Many captured Croatian soldiers and civilians were summarily executed after the battle. Journalists witnessed one such killing in Vukovar's main street.Sudetic, 21 November 1991 They also reported seeing the streets strewn with bodies in civilian attire. BBC television reporters recorded Serbian paramilitaries chanting: \\"Slobodane, Slobodane, ≈°alji nam salate, biƒáe mesa, biƒáe mesa, klaƒáemo Hrvate!\\" (\\"Slobodan [Milo≈°eviƒá], Slobodan, send us some salad, [for] there will be meat, there will be meat, we will slaughter Croats\\"). A Serbian journalist embedded with the JNA reserve forces in Vukovar later reported: Around 400 people from Vukovar's hospital ‚Äì non-Serb patients, medical personnel, local political figures and others who had taken refuge there ‚Äì were taken by the JNA. Although some were subsequently released, around 200 were transported to the nearby Ovƒçara farm and executed in what became known as the Vukovar massacre. At least 50 others were taken elsewhere and never seen again. Thousands more were transferred to prison camps in Serbia and rebel-controlled Croatia. Further mass killings followed. At Dalj, north of Vukovar, where many inhabitants were previously massacred, numerous prisoners from Vukovar were subjected to harsh interrogations, beatings and torture, and at least 35 were killed.Prosecutor v. Milo≈°eviƒá, 23 October 2002, #55. The JNA imprisoned 2,000 people at the Velepromet industrial facility in Vukovar, 800 of whom were classified by the JNA as prisoners of war. Many were brutally interrogated, several were shot on the spot by TO members and paramilitaries, and others were sent to Ovƒçara, where they were killed in the massacre. The remaining prisoners were transferred to a JNA-run prison camp in Sremska Mitrovica.Prosecutor v. Mrk≈°iƒá, Radiƒá & ≈†ljivanƒçanin ‚Äì Judgement, 27 September 2007, p. 67.Prosecutor v. ≈†e≈°elj, 7 December 2007, p. 8. They were stripped naked on arrival, beaten and interrogated, and forced to sleep for weeks on bare wooden floors. Most were released in January 1992 under an agreement brokered by UN envoy Cyrus Vance. Others were kept prisoner until mid-1992. Serbs who fought on the Croatian side were regarded as traitors by their captors and treated particularly harshly, enduring savage beatings. Detainees who were not suspected of involvement in military activities were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia. The non-Serb population of the town and the surrounding region was systematically ethnically cleansed, and at least 20,000 of Vukovar's inhabitants were forced to leave, adding to the tens of thousands already expelled from across eastern Slavonia. About 2,600 people went missing as a result of the battle. , the whereabouts of more than 440 of these individuals are unknown.Rudiƒá & Milekiƒá, 17 November 2017 There were also incidents of war rape, for which two soldiers were later convicted.Jutarnji list, 16 May 2006Croatian Radiotelevision, 4 June 2010Vjesnik, 14 September 2011 Serb forces singled out a number of prominent individuals. Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the director of the town's hospital,Simmons, 17 December 1991 who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media. She and her husband were taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison, where she was locked up in a single room with more than 60 other women for several weeks. Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings. After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross, the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange. The journalist Sini≈°a Glava≈°eviƒá was taken to Ovƒçara, severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre.Prosecutor v. Mrk≈°iƒá, Radiƒá & ≈†ljivanƒçanin ‚Äì Judgement, 27 September 2007, p. 100. Vukovar was systematically looted after its capture. A JNA soldier who fought at Vukovar told the Serbian newspaper Dnevni Telegraf that \\"the Chetnik [paramilitaries] behaved like professional plunderers, they knew what to look for in the houses they looted.\\" The JNA also participated in the looting; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented: \\"Tell me of even one reservist, especially if he is an officer, who has spent more than a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car.\\" More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, Eltz Castle, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege.The Economist, 4 March 1995 Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.Kroeger, 12 December 2001 =Indictments and trials= Three JNA officers ‚Äì Mile Mrk≈°iƒá, Veselin ≈†ljivanƒçanin and Miroslav Radiƒá ‚Äì were indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on multiple counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war, having surrendered or been captured in 2002 and 2003. On 27 September 2007, Mrk≈°iƒá was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment on charges of murder and torture, ≈†ljivanƒçanin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for torture and Radiƒá was acquitted.BBC News, 27 September 2007 ≈†ljivanƒçanin's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal.BBC News, 5 May 2009 It was reduced to ten years after a second appeal and he was granted early release in July 2011.Agence France-Presse, 7 July 2011 Slavko Dokmanoviƒá, the Serb mayor of Vukovar, was also indicted and arrested for his role in the massacre, but committed suicide in June 1998, shortly before judgement was to be passed.BBC News, 29 June 1998 Serbian paramilitary leader Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj was indicted on war crimes charges, including several counts of extermination, for the Vukovar hospital massacre, in which his \\"White Eagles\\" were allegedly involved.BBC News, 24 February 2003 In March 2016, ≈†e≈°elj was acquitted on all counts pending appeal.BBC News, 31 March 2016 On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber of the follow-up Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals convicted him of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to 10 years in prison for a speech delivered in May 1992 in which he called for the expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina. He was acquitted of the war crimes and crimes against humanity that he was alleged to have committed elsewhere, including in Vukovar.United Nations Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, 11 April 2018 The ICTY's indictment of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá characterised the overall JNA and Serb offensive in Croatia ‚Äì including the fighting in eastern Slavonia ‚Äì as a \\"joint criminal enterprise\\" to remove non-Serb populations from Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia. Milo≈°eviƒá was charged with numerous crimes against humanity, violations of the laws of war, and breaches of the Geneva Conventions in relation to the battle and its aftermath. He died in March 2006, before his trial could be completed.BBC News, 11 March 2006 The Croatian Serb leader Goran Had≈æiƒá was indicted for \\"wanton destruction of homes, religious and cultural buildings\\" and \\"devastation not justified by military necessity\\" across eastern Slavonia, and for deporting Vukovar's non-Serb population.Prosecutor v. Had≈æiƒá. 21 May 2004 He was arrested in July 2011, after seven years on the run, and pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.BBC News, 24 August 2011 He died in July 2016, before his trial could be completed.BBC News, 12 July 2016 In December 2005, a Serbian court convicted 14 former paramilitaries for their involvement in the hospital massacre.BBC News, 12 December 2005 In 2011, a Serbian court indicted more than 40 Croatians for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar.Voice of America News, 22 September 2011 An earlier indictment against a Croatian soldier was dropped because of irregularities in the investigation.The Economist, 4 March 2011 Croatia also indicted a number of Serbs for war crimes committed in Vukovar,BBC News, 1 June 2004 including former JNA generals Veljko Kadijeviƒá and Blagoje Ad≈æiƒá.Jeliniƒá, 26 November 2007 Ad≈æiƒá died of natural causes in Belgrade in March 2012 and never faced trial.Slobodna Dalmacija, 6 March 2012 Kadijeviƒá fled Yugoslavia following Milo≈°eviƒá's overthrow and sought asylum in Russia. He was granted Russian citizenship in 2008 and died in Moscow in November 2014.B92, 2 November 2014 In 1999, Croatia sued Yugoslavia before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that genocide had been committed in Vukovar. Following Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution in 2006, this suit was passed on to Serbia. In February 2015, the ICJ ruled that the battle and ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide, but affirmed that serious crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries.Blair, 3 February 2015BBC News, 3 February 2015 Political aspectsPropaganda= The Serbian and Croatian media waged a fierce propaganda struggle over the progress of the battle and the reasons behind it. Both sides' propaganda machines aimed to promote ultra- nationalist sentiments and denigrate the other side with no pretence of objectivity or self-criticism. The Croatian media described the Serbian forces as \\"Serb terrorists\\" and a \\"Serbo-Communist army of occupation\\" intent on crushing the thousand-year dream of an independent Croatia. The propaganda reached peak intensity in the wake of Vukovar's fall. The Croatian newspaper Novi list denounced the Serbs as \\"cannibals\\" and \\"brutal Serb extremists\\". The Serbian media depicted the JNA and Serbian forces as \\"liberators\\" and \\"defenders\\" of the Serbian people, and the Croatian forces as \\"Ustashoid hordes\\", \\"blackshirts\\", \\"militants\\" and \\"drunk and stoned monsters\\". There were overt appeals to racial and gender prejudice, including claims that Croatian combatants had \\"put on female dress to escape from the town\\" and had recruited \\"black men\\". Victim status became a central aim for the propaganda machines of both sides, and the battle was used to support claims of atrocities. Victims became interchangeable as anonymous victims were identified as Croats by the Croatian media and as Serbs by the Serbian media. According to the Serbian opposition periodical Republika, the state-owned station TV Novi Sad was under orders to identify any bodies its reporters filmed as being \\"Serbian corpses\\". After the battle, Belgrade television showed pictures of hundreds of corpses lined up outside Vukovar's hospital and claimed that they were Serbs who had been \\"massacred\\" by the Croats. According to Human Rights Watch, the bodies belonged to those who had died of their injuries at the hospital, whose staff had been prevented from burying them by the intense Serbian bombardment, and had been forced to leave them lying in the open. Serbian television continued to broadcast claims of \\"massacred Serbs in Vukovar\\" for some time after the town's fall. Such victim-centred propaganda had a powerful motivating effect. One Serbian volunteer said that he had never seen the town before the war, but had come to fight because \\"the Croats had a network of catacombs under the city where they killed and tortured children just because they were Serbs.\\"Tanner, 19 November 1992 Reuters erroneously reported that 41 children had been massacred in Vukovar by Croatian soldiers. Although the claim was retracted a day later, it was used by the Serbian media to justify military action in Croatia. Many of those fighting at Vukovar believed that they were engaged in a struggle to liberate the town from a hostile occupier. =International reaction= The international community made repeated unsuccessful attempts to end the fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the British government. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington to find a way to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an arms embargo on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992. International observers tried unsuccessfully to prevent the human rights abuses that followed the battle. A visit by UN envoys Marrack Goulding and Cyrus Vance was systematically obstructed by the JNA. Vance's demands to see the hospital, from which wounded patients were being dragged out to be killed, were rebuffed by one of the massacre's chief architects, Major Veselin ≈†ljivanƒçanin. The major also blocked Red Cross representatives in an angry confrontation recorded by TV cameras: \\"This is my country, we have conquered this. This is Yugoslavia, and I am in command here!\\" There was no international media presence in Vukovar, as there was in the simultaneous Siege of Dubrovnik and the subsequent Siege of Sarajevo, and relatively little of the fighting in Vukovar was broadcast to foreign audiences. The British journalist Misha Glenny commented that the JNA, the Croatian Serb government and many ordinary Serbs were often hostile to the foreign media, while the Croatians were more open and friendly. =Croatian reaction= The Croatian media gave heavy coverage to the battle, repeatedly airing broadcasts from the besieged town by the journalist Sini≈°a Glava≈°eviƒá. Much popular war art focused on the \\"VukoWAR\\", as posters dubbed it. The Croatian government began suppressing Glava≈°eviƒá's broadcasts when it became clear that defeat was inevitable, despite the confident slogans of \\"Vukovar shall not fall\\" and \\"Vukovar must not fall.\\" Two of the main daily newspapers, Veƒçernji list and Novi list, failed to report the loss of Vukovar and, on 20 November, two days after it had fallen, repeated the official line that the fight was still continuing. News of the surrender was dismissed as Serbian propaganda. Many Croatians soon saw Western satellite broadcasts of JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries walking freely through the town and detaining its inhabitants.Navarro, 20 November 1991 When the surrender could no longer be denied, the two newspapers interpreted the loss as a demonstration of Croatian bravery and resistance, blaming the international community for not intervening to help Croatia. The Croatian government was criticised for its approach to the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing politicians accused the government of betraying and deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure Croatia's international recognition. The only explanation that many were willing to accept for the town's fall was that it had been given up as part of a conspiracy. The Croatian commanders in Vukovar, Mile Dedakoviƒá and Branko Borkoviƒá, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by the Croatian military police. The Croatian government also suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedakoviƒá had pleaded with an evasive Tuƒëman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed. From a military point of view, the outcome at Vukovar was not a disaster for Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke the back of the JNA, leaving it exhausted and unable to press deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost completely surrounded by Serb-held territory and located closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb. Although the defeat was damaging to Croatian morale, in a strategic context, the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town. Following the battle, Vukovar became a symbol of Croatian resistance and suffering. The survivors, veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs, songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism, calling it variously \\"the phenomenon\\", \\"the pride\\", \\"the hell\\" and \\"the Croatian knight\\". Writers appealed to the \\"Vukovar principle\\", the \\"spirituality of Vukovar\\" and \\"Vukovar ethics\\", the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople. Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar. In 1994, when Croatia replaced the Croatian dinar with its new currency, the kuna, it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the Vuƒçedol Dove ‚Äì an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia, which was discovered near Vukovar ‚Äì on the new twenty-kuna note. The imagery emphasised the Croatian nature of Vukovar, which at the time was under Serb control. In 1993 and 1994, there was a national debate on how Vukovar should be rebuilt following its reintegration into Croatia, with some Croatians suggesting that it should be preserved as a monument. The ruling HDZ made extensive use of popular culture relating to Vukovar as propaganda in the years before the region was reintegrated into Croatia. In 1997, President Tuƒëman mounted a tour of eastern Slavonia, accompanied by a musical campaign called Sve hrvatske pobjede za Vukovar (\\"All Croatian victories for Vukovar\\"). The campaign was commemorated by the release of a compilation of patriotic music from Croatia Records. When Vukovar was returned to Croatian control in 1998, its recovery was hailed as the completion of a long struggle for freedom and Croatian national identity. Tuƒëman alluded to such sentiments when he gave a speech in Vukovar to mark its reintegration into Croatia: =Serbian reaction= alt=A blue-white-red Yugoslav flag, with the red Communist star in the middle, hangs on an iron fence outside the ruined shell of a house. A truck is partly visible parked in the driveway next to the building. Although the battle had been fought in the name of Serbian defence and unity, reactions in Serbia were deeply divided. The JNA, the state-controlled Serbian media and Serbian ultra- nationalists hailed the victory as a triumph. The JNA even erected a triumphal arch in Belgrade through which its returning soldiers could march, and officers were congratulated for taking \\"the toughest and fiercest Usta≈°a fortress\\". The Serbian newspaper Politika ran a front-page headline on 20 November announcing: \\"Vukovar Finally Free\\". In January 1992, from the ruins of Vukovar, the ultranationalist painter Miliƒá Stankoviƒá wrote an article for the Serbian periodical Pogledi (\\"Viewpoints\\"), in which he declared: \\"Europe must know Vukovar was liberated from the Croat Nazis. They were helped by Central European scum. They crawled from under the papal tiara, as a dart of the serpent's tongue that protruded from the bloated Kraut and overstretched Eurocommunal anus.\\"Stankovic, 17 January 1992 The Serbian geographer Jovan Iliƒá set out a vision for the future of the region, envisaging it being annexed to Serbia and its expelled Croatian population being replaced with Serbs from elsewhere in Croatia. The redrawing of Serbia's borders would unite all Serbs in a single state, and would cure Croats of opposition to Serbian nationalism, which Iliƒá termed an \\"ethno-psychic disorder\\". Thus, Iliƒá argued, \\"the new borders should primarily be a therapy for the treatment of ethno- psychic disorders, primarily among the Croatian population.\\" Other Serbian nationalist writers acknowledged that the historical record showed that eastern Slavonia had been inhabited by Croats for centuries, but accused the region's Croat majority of \\"conversion to Catholicism, Uniating and Croatisation\\", as well as \\"genocidal destruction\\". Most irredentist propaganda focused on the region's proximity to Serbia and its sizeable Serb population. The Croatian Serb leadership also took a positive view of the battle's outcome. Between 1991 and 1995, while Vukovar was under the control of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), the city's fall was officially commemorated as \\"Liberation Day\\". The battle was portrayed as a successful struggle by local Serbs to defend their lives and property from the aggression of the Croatian state. Thousands of Vukovar Serbs that had suffered alongside their Croatian neighbours, sheltering in basements or bomb shelters for three months in appalling conditions, were now denigrated as podruma≈°i, the \\"people from the basement\\". Serb civilian dead were denied recognition, and the only people buried in the Serbian memorial cemetery at Vukovar were local Serbs who had fought with or alongside the JNA. In contrast, many in Serbia were strongly opposed to the battle and the wider war, and resisted efforts by the state to involve them in the conflict. Multiple anti-war movements appeared in Serbia as Yugoslavia began to disintegrate. In Belgrade, sizeable anti-war protests were organized in opposition to the battle. The protesters demanded that a referendum be held on a formal declaration of war, as well as an end to conscription. When the JNA tried to call up reservists, parents and relatives gathered around barracks to prevent their children taking part in the operation. Resistance to conscription became widespread across Serbia, ranging from individual acts of defiance to collective mutinies by hundreds of reservists at a time. A number of Serbian opposition politicians condemned the war. Desimir To≈°iƒá of the Democratic Party accused Milo≈°eviƒá of \\"using the conflict to cling to power\\", and Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, appealed to JNA soldiers to \\"pick up their guns and run\\". After the fall of Vukovar, he condemned what had been done in the name of Yugoslavia, writing in the daily newspaper Borba: By late December 1991, just over a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted to end the war immediately and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milo≈°eviƒá and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use. Although the battle was publicly portrayed as a triumph, it profoundly affected the JNA's character and leadership behind the scenes. The army's leaders realised that they had overestimated their ability to pursue operations against heavily defended urban targets, such as the strategic central Croatian town of Gospiƒá, which the JNA assessed as potentially a \\"second Vukovar\\". The \\"Serbianisation\\" of the army was greatly accelerated, and, by the end of 1991, it was estimated to be 90 percent Serb. Its formerly pro-communist, pan-Yugoslav identity was abandoned, and new officers were now advised to \\"love, above all else, their unit, their army and their homeland ‚Äì Serbia and Montenegro\\". The JNA's failure enabled the Serbian government to tighten its control over the military, whose leadership was purged and replaced with pro-Milo≈°eviƒá nationalists. After the battle, General Veljko Kadijeviƒá, commander of the JNA, was forced into retirement for \\"health reasons\\", and in early 1992, another 38 generals and other officers were forced to retire, with several put on trial for incompetence and treason. Many individual JNA soldiers who took part in the battle were revolted by what they had seen and protested to their superiors about the behaviour of the paramilitaries. Colonel Milorad Vuƒçiƒá later commented that \\"they simply do not want to die for such things\\". The atrocities that they witnessed led some to experience subsequent feelings of trauma and guilt. A JNA veteran told a journalist from the Arabic-language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat: =Other Yugoslav reaction= In Bosnia and Herzegovina, President Alija Izetbegoviƒá made a televised appeal to Bosnian citizens to refuse the draft on the grounds that \\"this is not our war\\". He called it their \\"right and duty\\" to resist the \\"evil deeds\\" being committed in Croatia and said: \\"Let those who want it, wage it. We do not want this war.\\" When JNA troops transferred to the front via the Vi≈°egrad region of north- eastern Bosnia, local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine-gun posts. They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day. More than 1,000 people had to flee the area. This action, nearly seven months before the start of the Bosnian War, caused the first casualties of the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia. Macedonia's parliament adopted a declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, but it did not take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and bring them home. Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle, General Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian. His ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with ≈Ωivota Paniƒá, a Serb. In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, General Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.BBC News, 25 November 2005 Occupation, restoration and reconstruction Vukovar suffered catastrophic damage in the battle. Croatian officials estimated that 90 percent of its housing stock was damaged or destroyed, accounting for 15,000 housing units in total.Seeney, 22 August 2006 The authorities placed the cost of reconstruction at $2.5 billion.Marshall, 16 January 1998 The town barely recovered during its seven years under Serb control. Marcus Tanner of The Independent described post-battle Vukovar as: When Michael Ignatieff visited Vukovar in 1992, he found the inhabitants living in squalor: The population increased to about 20,000 as Serb refugees from other parts of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards.Lekic, 18 November 1992 Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves.Kovacic, 18 November 1992 The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry.Maguire, 4 July 1994 Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.Marshall, 8 March 1995 After the Erdut Agreement was signed in 1995, the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) was established to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia. This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998. It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers, and many of the pre-war inhabitants never returned. By March 2001, the municipality was recorded as having 31,670 inhabitants ‚Äì less than half the pre-war total ‚Äì of whom 18,199 (57.46 percent) were Croats and 10,412 (32.88 percent) were Serbs. The community did not recover its mixed character: Croats and Serbs now lived separate social lives. Public facilities such as shops, caf√©s, restaurants, sports clubs, schools, non-governmental organisations and radio stations were re-established on segregated lines, with separate facilities for each community. Although the Croatian government sponsored reconstruction efforts in and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, none of them were inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.Radosavljevic, 20 July 2011 Commemorations and memorials alt=View of a large stone cross carved with the Croatian coat of arms. Outlined against the blue sky are the cross and three vertically hung flags. Signs of the battle are still widely apparent in Vukovar, where many buildings remain visibly scarred by bullets and shrapnel. The riverside water tower has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial. The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle. At Ovƒçara, the site of the massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity. Local guides, some of whom lived through the battle, offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites on walking and bicycle tours. Every November, Vukovar's authorities hold four days of festivities to commemorate the town's fall, culminating in a \\"Procession of Memory\\" held on 18 November. This represents the expulsion of the town's Croat inhabitants and involves a five- kilometre (3.1 mile) walk from the city's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims. It is attended by tens of thousands of people from across Croatia. Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations, often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November. Until 2003, they held a separate, low-key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November. Such commemorations have been held on 18 November since then. The RSK-era term \\"Liberation Day\\" has been dropped, but Serbs also avoid using the Croatian terminology, instead calling it simply \\"18 November\\". The issue of how to remember the Serb dead has posed particular difficulties. Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood. The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V-shaped Serbian military cap, or ≈°ajkaƒça. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia, the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised. The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations. Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment, such as war monuments. The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial, a large cross made from white stone, where the Vuka flows into the Danube. According to Kardov, Serbs rarely if ever go there, and they feel great stress if they do. A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription; one day he got up the courage, ran to the monument, read it and immediately ran back to \\"safety\\". As Kardov puts it, Vukovar remains divided by an \\"invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group.\\" The Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims was built between 1998 and 2000. It is marked with 938 marble crosses. The battle is widely commemorated in Croatia. Almost every town has streets named after Vukovar. In 2009, the lead vessel of the Croatian Navy's two newly launched Helsinki-class missile boats was named after the town.Jane's Navy International, 30 January 2009 The Croatian Parliament has declared 18 November to be the \\"Remembrance Day of the Sacrifice of Vukovar in 1991\\", when \\"all those who participated in the defence of the city of Vukovar ‚Äì the symbol of Croatian freedom ‚Äì are appropriately honoured with dignity.\\" As a symbol of Croatia's national identity, Vukovar has become a place of pilgrimage for people from across Croatia who seek to evoke feelings of \\"vicarious insideness\\", as Kardov describes them, in the suffering endured during the country's war of independence. Some gather in front of the town's main memorial cross on New Year's Eve to pray as the year ends, though such sentiments have attracted criticism from local Croats for not allowing them to \\"rejoice for even a single night\\", as one put it. The town has thus become, in Kardov's words, \\"the embodiment of a pure Croatian identity\\" and the battle \\"the foundational myth of the Croatian state\\". This has led to it becoming as much an \\"imagined place\\", a receptacle for Croatian national sentiment and symbolism, as a real place. Kardov concludes that it is questionable whether Vukovar can ever once again be \\"one place for all its citizens\\". In November 2010, Boris Tadiƒá became the first President of Serbia to travel to Vukovar, when he visited the massacre site at Ovƒçara and expressed his \\"apology and regret\\".BBC News, 4 November 2010 Films and books The battle was portrayed in the Serbian films Dezerter (\\"The Deserter\\") (1992), Ka≈æi za≈°to me ostavi (\\"Why Have You Left Me?\\") (1993) and Vukovar, jedna priƒça (\\"Vukovar: A Story\\") (1994); in the Croatian films Vukovar se vraƒáa kuƒái (\\"Vukovar: The Way Home\\") (1994) and Zapamtite Vukovar (\\"Remember Vukovar\\") (2008); and in the French film Harrison's Flowers (2000). A 2006 Serbian documentary film about the battle, Vukovar ‚Äì Final Cut, won the Human Rights Award at the 2006 Sarajevo Film Festival.B92, 27 August 2006 The battle is also at the centre of Serbian writer Vladimir Arsenijeviƒá's 1995 novel U potpalublju (\\"In the Hold\\").

Overview  Dinsho originally was a small village situated to the west of its current site; Fiona Flintan was shown the solitary, aged eucalyptus tree that marked the marketplace of the original site. The village was moved in 1934 EC (AD 1941/2) adjacent to the main road running between Goba and Shashamane, and by 2000 the town had expanded considerably with the construction of approximately 60 houses around a new market site on the north side of the town. In her 2000 visit, Flintan found that the commercial and retail activities of Dinso consisted largely of houses, shops, ‚Äòhotels‚Äô and tea houses. She found the shops were \\"poorly stocked with few tinned and some dried goods such as spaghetti and plain biscuits.\\" The principal tourism services was the Wolf‚Äôs Den Caf√© which offers trekking facilities including the hiring of guides and horses.Fiona Flintan, \\"A Gender Sensitive Study of Perceptions and Practices In and Around Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia\\", WWF International, November 2000 p. 9 (accessed 20 December 2010) A Town Forum was established in AD 1991 and a Town Office five years later; Ibrahim Jundaa was elected Town Chairman in 1991, who was still Chairman when Flintan visited in 2000. Dinsho has both a primary and a secondary school; the former was rebuilt in the late 1990s and the latter built around 1970. A new health clinic was built around 1996, replacing the old one which had become dilapidated. There are two diesel-powered mills in the town for grinding barley. In 2000, Dinsho had two market days: a small local one on Saturdays and a larger one on Tuesday which draws people from villages around the town, as far as 25 kilometers away; these markets are held in different open places.

Plot In the small West Virginia mining town of Electric Park, a group of self-proclaimed teenage pacifists calling themselves \\"The Dandies\\" decide to begin carrying guns. The resolution starts after one of their members, Dick, buys what he thinks is a toy gun. His co- worker tells him the gun is real, and the two start shooting and studying guns in their spare time. They later recruit other outcasts, young men and one young woman who do not, or cannot, work in the mine, including one boy in leg braces and his younger brother Freddie. Dick becomes gradually more and more attached to the gun, naming it \\"Wendy\\" and writing it love letters. The Dandies have several quirks and idiosyncratic rules. A Dandy may never brandish his weapon in public, but instead gains self-confidence simply knowing he is carrying a concealed weapon. As a badge of membership, they cultivate a 'Brideshead Stutter' (a reference to the character Anthony Blanche in Brideshead Revisited, who also adopts a deliberate stammer). They refuse to say the word 'killing' and instead refer to it as 'loving.' They live up to their name, Dandies, by dressing in colorful, outdated clothing, including vests, long jackets and hats. Though they regularly shoot targets (bull's eyes are oddly common), they spend just as much time playing gun-related games, watching instructional videos and studying diagrams. They use their own personal guns, all antiques with names and back stories, more as props than weapons. Even when they do load and shoot their weapons, they favor style over function. The Dandies spend most of their time in an abandoned mining shaft that they decorate and call the Temple. Dick's loving childhood nanny Clarabelle introduces him to her troubled grandson Sebastian, on probation for a weapons-related crime, having to regularly check in with Dick, whom the town's sheriff deems to be a good role model. Dick allows Sebastian to break probation and asks him to join the Dandies, but only if he does everything on their terms. One day, Sebastian gives them a suspicious box full of guns, and soon breaks a club rule by firing another member's gun. Dick complains that Sebastian is \\"ruining it for everyone.\\" The group's sole female member, Susan, takes a shine to Sebastian and this threatens Dick. Freddie suggesting she's attracted to men with large penises. Sebastian tells Dick that he and his friends carry guns because they're scared, that everyone is scared. He tells them that his grandmother, is too scared of \\"the gangs\\" to even leave her home (these vague, mysterious \\"gangs\\" had already been mentioned by Dick's boss at Salomon's grocery store, who was terrified of them to the point of a nervous breakdown). Dick devises a sort of war plan for assisting Clarabelle on her yearly visit to her cousin's, believing it to be the \\"decent American\\" thing to do. The Dandies accompany Clarabelle on her walk, but she becomes panicked when they encounter a deputy sheriff. There is a scuffle, he tries to help out and the old lady ends up shooting the deputy. The sheriff asks the Dandies to hand over Clarabelle, even telling them they can keep their guns if they do so. He tells the boys that they are what the country is made of. The Dandies notice his automatic gun, which Dick calls \\"treacherous,\\" and sense that they are being set up just as several other police officers appear. The Dandies flee to the Temple to hide. Now outlaws, the Dandies decide to take Clarabelle to her cousin's once and for all. Their decision is based more on principle than practicality, and it is clear that they are willing to martyr themselves. They treat it as a suicide mission, cutting themselves ceremonially and donning their fanciest clothes. Sebastian discovers Dick's now-finished letter to Wendy, which ends with the coded threat: \\"And now, it's the time of the season for loving.\\" They head outside one by one, armed, to face the team of shotgun-toting police officers assembled by a legion of squad cars. The first to go, Huey\\\\, tells them \\"We're not interested in shooting anybody, so don't make us.\\" The Marshall arrives and tells Huey to \\"Drop the pathetic gun right this minute.\\" He is promptly shot by Huey, who smiles and announces \\"Officer d-d-down I'm afraid!\\" before hobbling into gunfire. Huey discovers that he can walk fine without his crutches just as he's gunned down. Meanwhile, a bullet ricochets and hits Clarabelle in the leg as the Dandies continue attempting to escort her to her cousin's house. Dick realizes that there is a sniper in their midst and sets on shooting the offender down. Susan is the next to shoot, using both of her guns and her carefully honed ricochet method. All the while, white lines and numbers on the screen graphically depicting the trajectories of the Dandies' shots. Susan is shot in the head. Stevie and his gun Badsteel come to her defense and he is shot in the heart. Sebastian asks Dick \\"What happened?\\" and a series of morgue photographs flash across the screen. Only Sebastian, Dick and Freddie remain. The three attempt to drag Clarabelle to safety. Freddie is the next to go. He has tied a cord around his testicles, a tactic with roots in Native American history that he championed earlier on, and grabs his crotch before getting up and firing. He is quickly shot down, rises, then is shot several more times. Clarabelle stirs and Dick is hit as he comes to her aid, though he manages to get her all the way to her cousin's house. While he is inside, police officers are scanning the windows and lining him up in their guns' sights. Sebastian remains outside, unharmed and hidden by the door of a police car. He sees Dick's gun, the one he called Wendy, lying in the street and recalls a line of Dick's letter: \\"Dear Wendy, I always dreamed that if someone were to make that final exit wound in me, it should be you. My saviour.\\" He grabs the gun and then runs inside the home of his grandmother's cousin. He goes upstairs and shoots Dick in the back, mouthing \\"Dick, [unknown]?\\" Dick resembles a pilgrim as he turns around in his buckle hat. His life, at least that which was contained by the film, flashes before his eyes. He examines the exit wound and whispers \\"Wendy\\". The police on the roof across the street shoot up the windows and, mostly likely, Sebastian.

Completed in about 1879, the painting was already in the collection of the French banker Ernest May when it was listed in the catalogue of the fourth Impressionist exhibition that year. It may also have been shown in the next Impressionist exhibit in 1880, but it was not well known until it entered the collections of the Louvre in 1923. The canvas shows an interior corner of the open trading floor of the Paris Stock Exchange (The Paris Bourse). May stands in the center of the picture wearing a top hat and pince-nez, listening to his colleague, a certain M. Bol√¢tre, leaning over his shoulder. They are likely discussing a document, possibly a bordereau, held aloft by a partially obscured third party. Although the owner and possible commissioner of the work was himself Jewish, art historian Linda Nochlin has interpreted the painting as an anti-Semitic depiction of Jews in Paris, due especially to the exaggerated features and postures of the subjects.Nochlin, Linda British art historian Richard Shone has written about the oil painting and its pastel study without mentioning anti-Semitism. In stark contrast to Nochlin, he describes the figures as having \\"humdrum features.\\" May himself, according to Shone, is depicted as a \\"seasoned figure\\" whose \\"expression gives nothing away.\\" Shone, Richard While anti-Semitism has a long history in France, there is little evidence of Degas holding this attitude until the time of the Dreyfus affair two decades later. The technique of Portraits at the Stock Exchange can be more closely related to Impressionism than many of Degas's earlier works. Evidence for this can be found in the painting's quickly applied, sketchy brushstrokes.

The novel is a spy thriller which follows the attempt by the title character, Alex Rider, to foil the plot of a Russian billionaire. The book was released in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2005 and in the United States on 20 April 2006. Initial reviews of the book were positive.  Plot Maximilian Webber, a former SAS man, gives a speech denouncing an extreme eco- terrorist organisation known as Force Three. After the speech, he is contacted on his mobile phone by an unknown man who declares him an enemy of Force Three. The phone explodes, killing him, for which Force Three claims responsibility. Meanwhile, Alex Rider is recuperating in hospital after being shot at the end of his previous mission. He meets Paul Drevin, the son of a Russian billionaire Nikolei Drevin. One night, four men break into the hospital and attempt to kidnap Paul but Alex manages to overpower them. However, he is captured by Kaspar, the leader, and imprisoned in an abandoned building where the men reveal themselves to be members of Force Three. The men set fire to the building after realising that Alex deliberately foiled their plan to kidnap Paul. Alex manages to escape from the fire by tightrope walking to an adjacent building and returns to the hospital, where he is debriefed by John Crawley, MI6 Chief of Staff, and later discharged. Back home, Nikolei Drevin invites Alex to stay with him for two weeks as thanks for preventing his son from being kidnapped. As Alex‚Äôs doctor has recommended that he take a holiday so he can relax and recuperate, he accepts. Alex meets Drevin and his jobsworth assistant, Tamara Knight, at a hotel where Drevin is holding a press conference about his space project, Ark Angel; it is set to be the first-ever space hotel. Alex is treated well by Drevin, but he starts to have suspicions about him when he realises that Paul just happened to have no guards around on the night Force Three broke in, despite claims of always being \\"a target\\". Stumbling into Drevin‚Äôs private study, Alex discovers that Drevin owns the building where Alex was interrogated and nearly killed by Force Three. The following day, Alex participates in a race on Drevin‚Äôs private go-kart track; Alex beats Drevin when the man attempts to cheat and injure Alex, revealing his hatred of losing. Later, Alex watches a football match at Stamford Bridge with the home team, Chelsea, up against a team owned by Drevin, which loses. Once more Alex encounters Force Three, who are giving a medal to the footballer who missed the final penalty. Alex is briefly taken by one of the Force Three men but manages to get away. Alex tells Tamara Knight about Force Three, but the footballer is killed when the medal, made of caesium, catches fire in the shower. Drevin, Tamara, Alex and Paul fly to New York City, but Alex is apprehended at the airport by an immigration official who claims that his passport is expired. This turns out to be a ruse by the CIA so they can bring Alex to Joe Byrne, the chief of the CIA. Byrne reveals that the CIA have conducted an investigation into Drevin's wealth and discovered that most of it is attained through contacts in the underworld and plans to arrest him for money laundering. However, Byrne is worried that Drevin will slip away from the CIA's hands, so he assigns Alex to report to him if he sees anything amiss at Flamingo Island, Drevin‚Äôs private island, from where Ark Angel will be launched. Smithers, the gadget master at MI6, arrives and provides Alex with gadgets, including mosquito repellent that attracts all manner of insects, an asthma inhaler that can be used as a grenade or a knockout gas dispenser, and an iPod that allows him to listen to phone calls. On Flamingo Island. Alex manages to intercept a phone call from Drevin who will be meeting someone the following night. Later, however, Drevin finds out about Alex's identity from the security chief, Payne, and decides to have him killed by sending him to dive into a shipwreck, in which he is locked in. Right when Alex is about to run out of air, Tamara appears and saves him, revealing that she has been Joe Byrne's inside man all along. The two of them go undercover to investigate Drevin's meeting, and see him meeting with Force Three, but are caught when Tamara accidentally sets off an alarm. Alex is brought to Drevin, who reveals his intention to destroy Ark Angel with a bomb and send its wreckage crashing down on the Pentagon in Washington D.C. As the project has gone over budget and Drevin can no longer finance it, he hopes to claim insurance from the disaster, as well as destroy the CIA's evidence of his illegal business practices. Mr. Payne, the island's head of security, reveals himself to be Kaspar. Force Three are just hired hands to act as scapegoats for Ark Angel‚Äôs destruction. Drevin kills all the members of Force Three (except Kaspar) and imprisons Alex. Alex escapes and meets the CIA team stationed in Barbados, but the rocket with the bomb launches off to Ark Angel. The CIA team storm Flamingo Island and Drevin attempts to shoot Alex in the chaos, but Alex dodges and Paul gets shot instead. Drevin leaves Paul and tries to escape, but his plane crashes, killing him instantly. As there is no way to stop the bomb on the ground, Alex is to travel up to Ark Angel to deal with it manually. He encounters Kaspar but manages to overpower him using the effects of zero- gravity, and Kaspar is stabbed to death by his own knife. Alex then moves the bomb away so that the wreckage left after detonation will simply break up and disintegrate instead of crashing into Earth. Ark Angel explodes and Alex falls back to earth, landing a hundred miles off the coast of Australia. CharactersReception Philip Ardagh at The Guardian gave Ark Angel a positive review, stating \\"It's perfectly pitched at its readership. Ark Angel reads the way a children's thriller should read\\" and \\"This is a welcome new addition [to the series].\\" However, Joe Queenan of The New York Times gave the book a more negative review. Comparing it to Charlie Higson's Blood Fever, the reviewer criticised Ark Angel for having \\"zero intellectual content\\", calling Horowitz's prose style \\"clunky, uninspiring\\". He also described Alex as \\"oddly bland\\" and \\"humorless\\".

Ligurian, like the languages of Lombardy, Piedmont, and surrounding regions, is listed by Ethnologue as a language in its own right, of the Romance Gallo-Italic branch (not to be confused with the ancient Ligurian language). Ligurian is far from dying out although most remaining speakers of it are elderly, but many young people still speak the language, and several associations are dedicated to keeping it alive, such as O Castello in Chiavari and A Compagna in Genoa. Written literature has been produced in Genoese since the 13th century, but the spelling has never been completely regularised. However, since 2008, there is an official orthography set up by the Academia Ligustica do Brenno, which attempts to put its script in order based on citizen speech of the Portoria area. Their rules are useful to write in all Ligurian language varieties. Genoese has had an influence on the Llanito vernacular of Gibraltar. Tongue twisters * Mi s√≤ as√¶ s'a s√¢ a s√§ as√¶ pe s√¢ a s√§sissa. = I don't have a clue whether the salt is going to be enough to salt the sausage. *Sci√¢ sc√Æe scign√¥a, sciando Sci√¢ x√™ua in sc√Æ sc√Æ. = Ski, madam, skying you fly on skis. *A-o m√™u n√™uo gh'√© n√™ue n√¢e n√™ue; a ci√π n√™ua de n√™ue n√¢e n√™ue a n'√™u an√¢. = At the new pier there are nine new ships; the newest of the nine new ships doesn't want to go. *Gi'√†ngiai g'han gi'oggi gi'uegge gi'unge cume gi'atri? = Do angels have eyes, ears, and (finger)nails like everyone else? (variant of the Cogorno comune) Expressions *Son zeneize, r√Æzo r√¶o, str√©nzo i d√©nti e parlo ci√¶o. = \\"I'm Genoese, I seldom laugh, I grind my teeth, and I say what I mean\\" (literally, \\"speak clearly\\"). * The child complains: √í famme. = I'm hungry. The mother answers: Gr√†ttite e zenogge e fatte e lasagne. = Scratch your knees and make lasagna. * Chi v√™u v√Æve da bon cresti√†n, da-i beggh√¨n o stagghe lont√†n. = If you want to live as a good Christian, stay away from those who pretend to be devout; a traditional warning to beware of fanatics and hypocrites. * No se peu sciusci√¢ e sciorb√Æ . = You can't have or do two contradicting things at the same time (literally, \\"you can't inhale and exhale\\"). * Bel√¨n! = Wow! or Damn! (very informal) (literally the word means \\"penis\\", but it lost its obscene meaning and is currently used as an intensifier in a lot of different expressions, acting almost as an equivalent of the English \\"Fuck!\\" or \\"Fuck it!\\").  Songs  One of the most famous folk songs written in the Genoese dialect is called Ma se ghe penso (or 'Ma se ghe pensu') written by Mario Cappello. Towards the end of the 20th century, artist Fabrizio De Andr√© wrote an entire album called Cr√™uza de m√§ in the Genoese dialect. Phonology Genoese phonology includes a number of similarities with French, one being the heavily nasalized vowels before nasal consonants (in VN(C) sequences), also occurring when Genoese speakers speak standard Italian. There used to be an alveolar approximant (English-like) opposed to an alveolar trill (using the 18th century spelling: caro \\"dear\\" vs. carro \\"cart\\"), but it is no longer heard in the city. It may still survive in some rural areas of Liguria, such as Calizzano and Sassello.Audio samples may be heard here. By far the most widespread type of today is the alveolar tap (very similar, or identical, to unstressed Standard Italian ). There are several distinctive local accents of Genoese: those of Nervi, Quinto and Quarto to the east of Genoa, Voltri, Pr√†, Pegli and Sestri to the west. There are also accents of the central Polcevera Valley and Bisagno. Genoese has eight vowels, twenty consonants, and three semivowels. ;Vowels * as in barba (\\"uncle\\"; \\"beard\\") * as in t√©sta (\\"head\\") * as in √¶goa (\\"water\\") * as in bibin (\\"turkey\\") * as in c√∂se (\\"what?\\") * as in anch√™u (\\"today\\") * as in comme (\\"how?\\") * as in fugassa (focaccia, a kind of Italian bread)  Orthography  * ^ is a circumflex accent placed above a vowel and doubles its length. * ao is read as the Italian ‚Äúau‚Äù or the genovese ‚Äúou‚Äù or a long Italian ‚Äúo‚Äù. * √® is read as a brief open e. The symbol √¶, made up of vowels a ed e, is read as an open long \\"e\\"; in groups √¶nn-a and √¶n it is read as an open short ‚Äúe‚Äù. * e and √© are read as a closed short ‚Äúe‚Äù; √™ is read as a long closed ‚Äúe‚Äù. * eu is read as if it were read in french: in eu and √©u the sound is short in √™u the sound is long. * j is used infrequently and indicates that i should be heard in words such as: gj√™mo (giriamo), mangj√¢ (manger√†), cacj√¶ (getterei), lascj√¢ (lascer√†), socj√™t√¶ (societ√†). * o, √≥ and √¥ are read as an Italian u like in the word muso; the length of √¥ is double the length of o and √≥. * √≤ and √∂ are read as o in Italian like in the word cosa; the length of √∂ is double √≤. * u is read as a French u with the exception in groups qu, √≤u and ou where the u is read as the u in the Italian word guida. * √ß always has a voiceless sound () like s in the Italian word sacco. * Word-final n and groups nn- , n- (written with a hyphen) indicate a velar n (, such as the n in the Italian word vengo) and are therefore pronounced nasally. The same goes for when n precedes a consonant (including b and p). * s followed by a vowel, s followed by a voiceless consonant, and s between vowels is always a voiceless , sound like the s in the Italian word sacco. s followed by a voiced consonant becomes voiced , as in Italian. * scc is pronounced , like sc of the Italian word scena followed sonorously by c of the Italian word cilindro. * x is read like the French j (e.g. jambon, jeton, joli). * z, even when it is doubled as zz, is always pronounced as the s in the Italian word rosa.

At 98 metres and 33 storeys in height, it is the tallest building in Atlantic Canada and the tallest building in Canada east of Quebec City. HistoryConstruction= The building was completed in 1971 and was officially named Fenwick Place, though most Halifax-area residents referred to it as Fenwick Tower. It occupies a property between Fenwick Street and South Street; it takes its name from Fenwick Street, which in turn honours Sir William Fenwick Williams, former Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. At the time the building was being built, the developer boldly touted it as the largest residential project east of Toronto. Once financial problems set in, the goal seemed unreachable and Fenwick Place was sold off to Dalhousie University for $5.25 million CAD as a student residence. Initial plans for the building featured the inclusion of a swimming pool on the top two floors. However, after taking over the project, Dalhousie decided that the cost of installing repeater pumps throughout the building to pump the water to the top would be prohibitively expensive, and scrapped the idea of the pool before construction reached that phase. During construction, Hurricane Beth filled the elevator shafts with seventeen feet of water. In 1971, when the first residents began to move in, complaints were made of apartments missing heat, windows, and other furnishings or amenities. =Hurricane Juan= Collapsed wall in 15th floor apartment following the hurricane On the night of September 28, 2003, Hurricane Juan hit Halifax, forcing all Fenwick residents to the building's basement overnight. Windows in several apartments shattered and the contents of some of these apartments were blown out onto the ground below. Residents were evacuated from approximately one week up to 8 weeks, depending on the damage and repair time to their individual apartments. Unlike most private landlords and other universities in the area, Dalhousie paid for all displaced students and families to be housed in hotels until the green light was given to return. =Sale= In 2008, the university hired a firm to move towards the sale of the building. Spokespeople downplayed the possibility that the building might be demolished, citing the rarity of a building this tall in Halifax coupled with the difficulty in building a new one. They also suggested a refurbishment would be much more likely, and that a sale would take some time to go through, given the size and complexity of the project. In 2009 Templeton Properties purchased Fenwick Place from Dalhousie University and has begun the refurbishment of the apartments. After purchasing Fenwick Place in 2009, Templeton Properties officially changed the name to Fenwick Tower to reflect the name that was commonly used. DescriptionElevators= There are four elevators in the building. One is an express elevator, permitting access to only the basement, lobby, and uppermost floors. Another features doors on either end of the cabin, and is often used as a service elevator. The two remaining lifts are local elevators servicing all floors. =Floors= Fenwick Tower in 2011 Fenwick Tower consists of 33 storeys, not including an elevator control room at the top, also containing an east-facing webcam run by the Chebucto Community Net. During the Dalhousie period of ownership, the 32nd and 33rd floors were used for international exchange students, as well as hearing and speech clinics associated with the School of Human Communication Disorders, which also occupied the \\"PR\\" floor (the first underground floor). The 31st storey, which lacks direct elevator access, contains mechanical rooms. The 30th floor contain storage areas that jut down to the floor below in some places. There is an unmarked floor between the 15th and 16th floors that contains boilers and other maintenance equipment. There is no direct elevator access to this floor. Like many buildings, there is no official or marked 13th floor. Hence, the only floors whose marked number does not match the actual storey of the building are the 14th and 15th floors. They are actually the 13th and 14th storeys, respectively. The main floor consists of the reception area, offices, the main foyer, and the entrance to Fenwick Street. Following the conversion of the property to rental apartments, an on- site fitness centre was added to the floor. The basement contains the aforementioned \\"PR\\" level, as well as three parking levels; \\"P1\\" (nearest to ground), \\"P2\\", and \\"P3\\".

Komissarzhevskaya as Nora, A Doll's House, 1904 Vera Fyodorovna Komissarzhevskaya (; 8 November 1864 ‚Äì 23 February 1910) was one of the most celebrated actresses and theatre managers of the late Russian Empire. She made her professional debut in 1893, after having acted as an amateur at Constantin Stanislavsky's Society of Art and Literature. She is probably best known today for originating the role of Nina in the ill-fated premiere of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg in 1896. Though the production was deemed an utter failure, Komissarzhevskaya's performance was highly praised. Later in her career, Komissarzhevskaya is notable for her patronage of the up-and-coming theatre artist, Vsevolod Meyerhold. Following Meyerhold's unsuccessful attempts to stage symbolist plays at Stanislavsky's Moscow Art Theatre, Komissarzhevskaya invited him to try his experiments at her new Dramatic Theatre. During their short-lived collaboration, the two managed to develop Meyerhold's symbolist aesthetic and Komissarzhevskaya herself starred in two of the most critically and commercially successful productions. Life and work Komissarzhevskaya was born in Saint Petersburg, into a wealthy and distinguished family. Her father was the celebrated Russian opera singer Fyodor Komissarzhevsky, a leading tenor at the Mariinsky Theatre, and her mother, Mariya Nikolaevna Shulgina, was the daughter of General Nikolai Shulgin, a war hero and officer in the Preobrazhensky regiment. Komissarzhevskaya had a close relationship with her father, and she frequently corresponded with Komissarzhevsky. Towards the end of his life, he wrote to Mariya Nikolaevna, saying: This commitment to his daughter's life and work was a testament to her favor, as her half-brother was Theodore Komisarjevsky, a famous theatrical director in his own right. At the age of 19, Komissarzhevskaya married the painter Count , but preferred to keep her stage name even after the marriage. Some years later, she was broken- hearted to discover that her sister was pregnant with Muravyov's child, and she left him, throwing herself into her acting career. In 1896, she began working at Saint Petersburg's Alexandrinsky Theatre, where her greatest triumph was the role of Nina Zarechnaya in the premiere of Chekhov's The Seagull (1897). In 1904, Komissarzhevskaya founded her own theatre in Saint Petersburg, where she appeared in productions of Chekhov's Ivanov and Uncle Vanya, ‚Äîand as Desdemona in William Shakespeare's Othello, Ophelia in Hamlet, and Nora in Ibsen's A Doll's House. Tiring of the nineteenth-century theatre's routine scenarios and the dominant naturalistic trends of the time, however, Komissarzhevskaya boldly extended an invitation to the young director Vsevolod Meyerhold. Though they found some success with Komissarzhevskaya starring in the title roles of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Maeterlink's Sister Beatrice, the collaboration proved unfruitful. Meyerhold failed to create a role that catered to Komissarzhevskaya's acting style, a mixture of intense emotional sensitivity with high theatrical seriousness. She dismissed him after just one year, and spent the remainder of her career touring old productions in the United States and Europe. Even after her exit from Russia, Komissarzhevskaya's fame was such that when she died of smallpox in 1910, her funeral was attended by vast crowds of mourners, and even occasioned some poignant lyrics from the Russian poet Alexander Blok. One of the major theatres of St. Petersburg still bears her name and, in 1980 there was even a biographical film made about the actress' life and career called, Ya - aktrisa (\\"I am an actress\\"), starring Natalia Saiko.

Starzl spent an extra year at medical school, using the additional time to complete a doctorate in neurophysiology, in 1952. He wrote a seminal paper describing a technique to record the electrical responses of deep brain structures to sensory stimuli such as a flash of light or a loud sound. The paper is highly cited, having been referenced in 384 articles by January 2019.Starzl TE, Taylor CW, Magoun HW. Collateral Afferent Excitation of Reticular Formation of Brain Stem. Journal of Neurophysiology, Nov 1951 In 1959, he gained a Markle scholarship. After obtaining his medical degree, Starzl trained in surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. At both places, he conducted lab and animal research, showing a keen interest in liver biology. = Career = Starzl was a surgeon and researcher in the then nascent field of organ transplantation at the University of Colorado from 1962 until his move to the University of Pittsburgh in 1981. The Institute for Scientific Information released information in 1999 that documented that his work had been cited more than any other researcher in the world. Between 1981 and June 1998, he was cited 26,456 times. His autobiographical memoir, The Puzzle People, was named by The Wall Street Journal as the third best book on doctors' lives. Starzl's most notable accomplishments include: *Performing the first human liver transplant in 1963, and the first successful human liver transplant in 1967, both at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.Milestones in Organ Transplantation National Kidney Foundation *Establishing the clinical utility of ciclosporin (cyclosporine) in 1982, and tacrolimus in 1991, both leading to FDA approval; *Development of multiple technical advances in organ preservation, procurement and transplant; *Delineating the indications and limitations of abdominal organ transplantation; *Defining the underlying basis for organ transplantation as a treatment of inherited metabolic diseases (thus providing the rationale for current-day gene therapy efforts); *Recognizing the causative role of immunosuppression in the development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and other opportunistic infections and the utility of reversing the immunosuppressed state as the principal treatment; *Performing the first simultaneous heart and liver transplant on six-year-old Stormie Jones at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in 1984;New York Times.

In 2006, at a celebration for his 80th birthday, the University of Pittsburgh renamed one of its newest medical research buildings the Thomas E. Starzl Biomedical Science Tower in recognition of his achievements and contributions to the field. On October 15, 2007, the Western Pennsylvania American Liver Foundation and the City of Pittsburgh honored Starzl by dedicating Lothrop Street, near his office and the biomedical research tower bearing his name, as \\"Thomas E.

Population: 30,500 (1975). Munitions factory Sestroretsk was founded by Peter the Great in 1714 due to the construction of a munitions factory (today's Sestroretsk Toolmaking Factory). Healthcare The town is known as a balneologic and climatic resort. A large hospital and rehabilitation center is situated within the boundaries of the town. It is the City hospital No. 40 of Saint Petersburg. Political history In 1812, the town was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Finland, along with Old Finland. In 1864, the town was transferred to Russia in exchange for a promise of compensation, supposedly in the form of access to the Arctic Ocean at Petsamo.

He was one of the most important Croatian poets of the 19th century Illyrian movement and the main representative of romanticism in Croatia. He was also the paternal grandfather of the Austrian writer and poet Paula Preradoviƒá, who is best known for composing the lyrics of the Austrian national anthem.  Early life and education  Petar Preradoviƒá was born to a family of Serb origin in the village of Grabrovnica near the town of Pitomaƒça in modern-day Croatia, which was a part of the Croatian Military Frontier at the time. He was born to Ivan and Pelagija (nee Ivanƒçiƒá) Preradoviƒá, and spent his childhood in his fathers' hometown of Grubi≈°no Polje and ƒêurƒëevac.Petar Preradoviƒá, Milivoj ≈†repel, Izabrane pjesme, Izd. Matice hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., Crtice moga ≈æivota, p. (I) In autobiography Crtice moga ≈æivota, Preradoviƒá wrote of himself as a Croat.Petar Preradoviƒá, Milivoj ≈†repel, Izabrane pjesme: uvod napisao Milivoj ≈†repel: sa slikom pjesnikovom , Izd. Matice Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., p. 3, 16, 366-367 He had two sisters, Marija (20 December 1812 ‚Äì 25 February 1867) and Ana (11 February 1820 ‚Äì 5 April 1822).Petar Preradoviƒá. Pozdrav domovini: izabrane pjesme, (izbor i redakcija Dragutin Tadijanoviƒá), Matica hrvatska, Zagreb, 1968., p. 203 Following his fathers' death in 1828, Preradoviƒá, like many from the Military Frontier area, chose to become a professional soldier. He enrolled at the military academy in Bjelovar and later Wiener Neustadt where he converted from Eastern Orthodox Church to Catholicism and went on to excel as one of the school's best students. During the training, all Academy students were conducted as Roman Catholics, which could've been changed at the express request of the soldier. However, this has rarely occurred. Thus Preradoviƒá, tacitly signed as a Roman Catholic convert from the Orthodox Christianity which was legitimized by a formal act of conversion. His loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church was later increased since both he and his wife were Roman Catholics.[Eminent Serbs XIX century, year 2, Volume II, edited by Andra Gavrilovic, Serbian edition printing (deon. Company) in Zagreb. 1903. pp. 14th] While at the Academy, he began writing his first poems in German with distinctive features of romanticism.  Career  After graduation, he was stationed in Milan where he met Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski, a fellow officer from Croatia, who inspired him to start writing in Croatian. This stimulated his interest in Croatian culture and Croatia's political and economic situation. After Milan, Preradoviƒá was posted to Zadar where he wrote his first song in Croatian, Poslanica ≈†piri Dimitroviƒáu [Epistle to ≈†piro Dimitroviƒá]. His writings were published in the local Croatian language newspaper Zora dalmatinska in 1846. He then went to Zagreb where he met the leading figures of the Illyrian movement. At the request of Ante Kuzmaniƒá, who was then editor of the Zora dalmatinska, Preradoviƒá wrote the song \\"Zora puca, biche dana\\" for the first issue of the paper (published on 1 January 1844). Like most of his songs, this one speaks of the emergence of Croatian national consciousness and suggests a new, prosperous era for the Croatian people. Since then, he has been systematically continuing his poetry work in Croatian language and has also advocated official acceptance of Ljudevit Gaj's grammar in southern Croatia. In 1848, he was again stationed in Italy where he took part in the Wars of Italian Unification. In September of 1848, he traveled to Dubrovnik where a month later he married Zadar native Pavica de Ponte. In 1849, he was transferred to Zagreb where he was assigned to the military department of the Ban's Court (Government of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia). In 1851, Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá appointed him deputy commander of the military department and Ban's adjutant. At the end of 1852, he moved to Cremona, in 1853 to Verona, in September of that same year to Panƒçevo, and afterward to Kovin, Arad and Transylvania. In 1854, he was assigned to the Supreme Command in Vienna. In 1855, his wife Pavica committed suicide which made him interested in spiritism in his later years. In 1865, he married Emma Regner and was sent to Verona to fight in a war with Italy. On 24 February 1864, Emperor Franz Joseph I awarded Preradoviƒá with the nobility, and also gave him a part of his personal treasury as Preradoviƒá was at the time in a bad financial situation. Preradoviƒá wrote a song in his honor. In 1866, he became a general. In mid-1871 he participated in the military exercises at Bruck and was in the same year suggested for the position of Croatian ban, but he was very sick and wrote in a letter that he was not interested. His health deteriorated at the end of 1871 so he was sent to treatment in Mariabrunn near Munich and then in the Austrian town of Fahrafeld. Petar Preradoviƒá died on 18 August 1872 from dropsy. He was buried on 21 August 1872 in Vienna. Viennese youth organization Velebit, proposed that his remains should be transferred to Zagreb. On 11 July 1879, his remains were removed from the Vienna cemetery and transferred to the arcades of Mirogoj cemetery where he was buried on 14 July 1879.Petar Preradoviƒá, Milivoj ≈†repel, Izabrane pjesme, Izd. Matice hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., p. 19 Mayor of Zagreb August ≈†enoa held an inspired speech and stirred up the hymn to Preradoviƒá, which was inaugurated by Ivan Zajc. The gravestone monument to Petar Preradoviƒá, depicting Croatia in a form of a woman that lays flowers on his grave, was made by sculptor Ivan Rendiƒá. He had eight children: ƒåedomil (8 July 1849 ‚Äì 24 September 1849), Milica (b. 24 September 1850), Slavica (17 August 1852 ‚Äì 23 March 1854), Du≈°an (18 September 1854 ‚Äì 30 September 1920), Radovan Josip Petar (24 August 1858 ‚Äì 11 February 1908), Milan (5 February 1866 ‚Äì 6 August 1879), Zora (13 December 1867 ‚Äì 10 May 1927) and Jelica (13 June 1870 ‚Äì 27 December 1870). One of his grandchildren was Paula von Preradoviƒá, Austrian poet and the author of the Austrian national anthem.  Lyric Poetry  Pervenci, cover from 1846 While attending the military academy in Vienna, Preradoviƒá began writing his first poems (Der Brand von Neustadt, 1834) in German. In 1840, he met Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski, who awoke his interest in Croatian culture and encouraged him to write in his native Croatian language. In 1841, in Zagreb's German magazine Croatia he published the song Das Uskoken-M√§dchen. On the initiative of ≈†piro Dmitroviƒá, in 1843, Preradoviƒá wrote the first poem in the Croatian language, Poslanica ≈†piri Dimitroviƒáu. His first published song written in Croatian Zora puca, biche dana dana was published in 1844 in the first issue of Zora dalmatinska.Petar Preradoviƒá, Milivoj ≈†repel, Izabrane pjesme, Izd. Matice hrvatske, Zagreb, 1890., p. 21-22 Preradoviƒá remained one of the constants of Croatian romanticism by its very nature.Dubravko Jelƒçiƒá, Povijest hrvatske knji≈æevnosti, Naklada P.I.P. Paviƒçiƒá, Zagreb, 2004., II. edition, , p. 182 The romantic love for medieval traditions has a complete expression in two Preradoviƒá's dramas, Marko Kralyevich and Vladimir i Kosara. But he achieved widespread popularity with his lyric poems. His pensive melancholy expressed itself in the allegory Putnik (The Traveler), which hides a whole life of homelessness and isolation. The same note of sadness and longing is felt in his songlet Miruy, miruy, srtse moye (Be still, my heart, be still): Who has stirred thee, heart of mine, That thou art so restless now? As a bird in a cage thou longest, In the heavens to wing thy way. Be still, my heart, be still! . . . In most of his poems, Preradoviƒá upheld a mystic patriotism in the manner of the Polish messianists and Czech and Slovak pan-Slavists. But being too reflective, and not so keen as his progenitors, he did not exercise any decided influence on his successors.  Translator  Preradoviƒá translated during schooling the song M√°y by Czech poet Karel Hynek M√°cha to German. He published in Prevenci his translations of works by Lanau, Scmidt, L√ºbeck, Gleim, Wieland, Goethe and B√ºrger. Under Kukuljeviƒá's advisement, he translated part of Ivan Gunduliƒá's Osman to German. Preradoviƒá translated from French to Croatian Allan Kardec's L‚Äô√âvangile selon le Spiritisme (Zagreb, 1865). He also translated works by V. J. Pick, George Gordon Byron, Dante Alighieri and Alessandro Manzoni. Preradoviƒá translated from Croatian to German Franjo Raƒçki's Rieka prema Hrvatskoj (Fiume gegen√ºber von Croatien, Dr Franz Raƒçki, Aus dem kroatischen √ºbers von X.Y., Zagreb, 1869).

Their album, Magic Lantern, released in 1968, was pressed in an edition of 80 - 100 copies, and despite its rarity is well considered by fans of psychedelic rock music even today. The music of the album was used to accompany the Baron and Bailey Light Circus at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Magic Lantern was reissued on CD by Gear Fab Records in 2001. History In 1967, drummer John Kowalski and guitarist Bob Homa were in a Chicago-area garage band called the Real Things. When the Real Things broke up, they decided to form a new band, and placed ads in several newspapers, seeking additional musicians. On the strength of their auditions, Marc Swenson became the lead guitarist, and Gloria Lambert the lead vocalist. Homa switched from guitar to bass. The new band named themselves Haymarket Square, a reference to the 1886 Haymarket Square Riot. They soon became popular and played at various venues in the Chicago area. They performed on the same bill as more well-known groups, including the Yardbirds and Cream. In 1968, they played as part of the Barnum and Bailey Light Circus, a sound and light show that was produced by two college professors, and which was performed at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. Later that year, the band's only album, Magic Lantern, was released by Chaparral Records, but not put on general sale, instead being used for promotion and handed out to some MCA visitors. After the recording of Magic Lantern, Homa left the band, and was replaced by bassist Ken Pitlik. Robert Miller joined the band and played rhythm guitar. This reconfigured lineup stayed together until Haymarket Square disbanded in 1974. Gloria Lambert and Marc Swenson married, had two sons, and subsequently divorced. Lambert works at a high school in Wisconsin as a Spanish and English teacher. Bob Homa received his bachelor's degree in architecture and has spent most of his career managing projects in shopping mall development and renovation.

Fictional biography In High Noon, Will Kane is a town marshal of the fictional Hadleyville, New Mexico Territory. It is both his wedding day and his last day as a marshal. He is about to leave town with his bride, Amy, to start a new life as a store clerk when the clerk of the telegraph office brings bad news: a man he sent to prison some years earlier, Frank Miller, has been released from prison and is arriving on the noon train. Kane, and the townsfolk who remember Miller, know Miller's visit is for one reason: revenge. Upon his conviction years earlier, Miller swore he would kill Will Kane. Kane's friends tell him to leave town, which he does briefly, but he feels that running away is not a solution, so he returns to face Miller and the gang. Will tries to find support from his friends and others, but none wants to help - they all tell him to leave town or offer reasons why they can't (or won't) help. Will chooses to stand up against this gang alone, even though it could result in his own death. After a brief gun fight in town, Kane kills the four men. Amy also saves his life by giving up her pacifist religion to kill one of the men. As townspeople come out to offer congratulations, Kane takes off his tin star and throws it in the dirt. The movie ends with Kane and his bride driving out of town to destinations unknown. High Noon, Part II: The Return of Will Kane, Kane returns to the town of Hadleyville, a year after the events of High Noon, and finds that the town is now in the hands of a corrupt marshal and his two aides. J.D. Ward, the man that replaced Kane as marshal, is a tyrant who shoots up the horses Will has just purchased. Ward is after Ben Irons and his men in order to get the bounty on them, even though Ward knows they are innocent. Ben gets away. Ward pursues him, and Kane decides to help Ben. Ben dies from a gunshot wound. Ward is going to arrest Kane for helping Ben, but the town rallies together and issues a warrant for Ward's arrest. Kane then again puts on the tin star and shoots Ward to death. Development Despite the iconic portrayal of the character by Gary Cooper (see below), \\"Cooper was not producer Stanley Kramer's first choice to play Marshal Will Kane.\\"Susan Doll and Christopher Lyon, The Macmillan dictionary of films and filmmakers (Macmillan, 1984), 197. Nevertheless, Will Kane is \\"one of Cooper's most famous roles.\\"\\"Actor Tom Skerritt plays Kane in 'High Noon' remake,\\" The Dailer Courier (Sunday, August 13, 2000): 8C. Lee Majors explained that he accepted the role in the sequel, because \\"I've always admired Gary Cooper. And I wanted to do a Western again.\\"\\"Lee Majors plays 'High Noon',\\" The Virgin Islands Daily News (November 8, 1980): 8. Ron Hardy, who directed the recent remake, argued that Tom Skerrit was an ideal actor to take over the role in the remake. Hardy explained that like \\"Cooper, he is Mr. Everyday. People know who Tom Skerritt is. They don't treat him like a superstar. They feel he's approachable.\\" Reception In 1952, Gary Cooper won a Golden Globe Award and his second Academy Award for his portrayal of Will Kane.Pat Browne, The guide to United States popular culture (Popular Press, 2001), 201. While The Washington Post refers to the character as \\"A Classic Role,\\"Michael E. Hill, \\"Western Showdown; Tom Skerritt Takes on A Classic Role,\\" The Washington Post (Aug 20, 2000). Entertainment Weekly ranked the character fourteenth on its list of the top twenty \\"All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture\\" in April 2009. The magazine included him on its list because in \\"High Noon, Gary Cooper's retiring lawman faces down a killer and his goons despite being deserted by the rest of the town.\\" Entertainment Weekly went on to cite his most heroic move as when \\"Kane's last ally gets cold feet, he tells him to go to his family, and then refuses the help of a teenager.\\"\\"The Top 20 Heroes,\\" Entertainment Weekly 1041 (April 3, 2009): 36. Kane was also ranked by the American Film Institute as the fifth greatest movie hero of all time. Nevertheless, although Cooper's performance has received considerable praise as indicated above, Majors and Skerritt's performances have not been so positively received. The New York Daily News referred to Lee Majors as \\"sadly miscast\\" as Kane in the sequel.ERIC MINK, \\"IT'S 'NOON' TIME AGAIN, BUT THE AIM IS TOO HIGH,\\" New York Daily News (August 18th 2000). Entertainment Weekly also contrasted Cooper with Skerritt to Skerritt's disadvantage. Reviewer Ken Tucker reminisces upon \\"the all-purpose image of Cooper that's taken hold in the popular imagination: the gaunt, chiseled stone face, a stoic deadpan that rendered Cooper the leading-man, romantic-actor equivalent of Buster Keaton....By contrast, Skerritt saunters through the new Noon as if he were still the easygoing, ironic lawman of Picket Fences.\\"Ken Tucker, \\"TV Review of High Noon,\\" (Aug 18, 2000).

The battle took place at Talikoti, today a town in northern Karnataka, about to the southeast from the city of Bijapur. The defeat of the Vijayanagara Empire at Talikota, followed by the subsequent destruction and looting of their capital, Vijayanagara, led to the slow decline and eventual collapse of the state under the successors of Aliya Rama Raya. Battle Battle of Talikota. The Muslim Sultanates to the north of Vijayanagara united and attacked Aliya Rama Raya's army, on 26 January 1565, in an engagement known as the Battle of Talikota. The armies clashed on the plains near the villages of Rakkasagi and Tangadigi (it is also known as the Battle of Rakkasagi-Tangadi). The Vijayanagara army was winning the battle, but the tide turned when two Muslim commanders (the Gilani brothers) of the Vijayanagara army switched sides and turned their loyalty to the united Sultanates. At this critical point of the battle, a subversive attack was launched by them. Suddenly Aliya Rama Raya found himself surprised when the two divisions in his ranks turned against him.K. A. Nilakanta Sastri (1955), A History of South India, Oxford University Press, p. 267, They captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot, with Sultan Hussain on the Sultanates side joining them., Quote: \\"When battle was joined in January 1565, it seemed to be turning in favor of Vijayanagara - suddenly, however, two generals of Vijayanagara changes sides. Aliya Rama Raya was taken prisoner and immediately beheaded.\\" Outcome The \\"Malik-i-Maidan\\" (Master of the Field) cannon, stated to be the largest piece of cast bronze ordnance in the world, was utilized by the Deccan Sultanates during the Battle of Talikota. It was provided by Ali Adil Shah I (Bijapur Sultanate) The beheading of Rama Raya created confusion and havoc in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which led to a complete rout. The Sultanates' armies plundered Hampi and reduced it to rubble. Robert Sewell, in his book The Forgotten Empire, concludes thus ‚Äì \\"With fire and sword, with crowbars and axes, they carried on day after day their work of destruction. Never perhaps in the history of the world has such havoc been wrought, and wrought so suddenly, on so splendid a city; teeming with a wealthy and industrious population in the full plenitude of prosperity one day, and on the next seized, pillaged, and reduced to ruins, amid scenes of savage massacre and horrors beggaring description.\\" After the battle of Talikota, the Vijayanagara royal family established a kingdom near Penukonda, in present-day Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh and later in 1597 they shifted their capital to Chandragiri and ruled till 1646.

History The WAGR had its origins in 1879, when the Department of Works & Railways was established. In 1890, the Department was abolished and replaced by the WAGR and the Department of Works & Buildings (later the Public Works Department). In September 1975, the WAGR adopted the trading name Westrail and an associated logo. However, the official name of the WAGR was not changed. The new name was the main element of a complete program to improve the WAGR's public image. Every visible feature of the organisation was to be associated with the new Westrail identity. The transition from WAGR to Westrail quickly began, with the new name rapidly and almost universally replacing the old one in the vocabulary of staff and the public. Strong impetus to acceptance of the new corporate identity was given by the completion of a new Westrail office headquarters and passenger facility at East Perth Terminal (then known as Perth Terminal). The new building, named the Westrail Centre, was opened by the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, on 12 November 1976. Westrail was responsible for managing the state's rail infrastructure. It operated urban and regional passenger and freight services throughout Western Australia. In Perth, Westrail provided the metropolitan area rail service, under contract to another arm of the State government. Its country passenger services involved the operation of both trains and road coaches. In October 1987, it was announced by Premier Brian Burke and Federal Minister for Land Transport & Infrastructure Support, Peter Duncan, that a merger of Westrail with Australian National was being investigated.\\"Profitable merger\\" Railway Gazette International volume 143 issue 12 December 1987 page 786 Nothing ever came of it.AN-Westrail Integration: An Assessment of Options Bureau of Transport Economics May 1988 On 17 December 2000, the WAGR's freight division along with the Westrail name and logo were sold to Australia Western Railroad, a subsidiary of the Australian Railroad Group (ARG).

On 1 January 2003, the WAGR Commission's functions were absorbed by the Public Transport Authority. The former Westrail Centre is now known as the Public Transport Centre. Corporate identity Initially, Westrail applied an orange with blue stripe livery to its locomotives and passenger vehicles. Freight rolling stock and road trucks were painted yellow, and blue was used on all signs, buildings and printed material. The Westrail logo incorporated a stylised \\"W\\" surmounted by a solid bar representing a railway track. Between the bar and the \\"W\\" was the word \\"Westrail\\".

Article: Cold-Iron the Ships by Capt. Pawanexh Kohli While the term denotes shore as opposed to off-shore, it is sometimes applied to aircraft or land-based vehicles (such as campers, heavy trucks with sleeping compartments and tour buses), which may plug into grid power when parked for idle reduction. The source for land-based power may be grid power from an electric utility company, but also possibly an external remote generator. These generators may be powered by diesel or renewable energy sources such as wind or solar. Shore power saves consumption of fuel that would otherwise be used to power vessels while in port, and eliminates the air pollution associated with consumption of that fuel. A port city may have anti-idling laws that require ships to use shore power. Use of shore power may facilitate maintenance of the ship's engines and generators, and reduces noise. Oceangoing ships \\"Cold ironing\\" is specifically a shipping industry term that came into use when all ships had coal-fired engines. When a ship tied up at port, there was no need to continue to feed the fire and the iron engines would literally cool down, eventually going completely cold ‚Äì hence the term \\"cold ironing\\". If commercial ships can use shore-supplied power for services such as cargo handling, pumping, ventilation and lighting while in port, they need not run their own diesel engines, reducing air pollution emissions. Small craft Small boats using shore power On small private boats, the power supply used is usually the same as regular household electric power. Some small craft may not need electric power while docked, or may replace on-board generators (if any) with solar panels sufficient to run a small battery-operated system. Boats that are connected to shorepower only need sufficient battery capacity to last until the next shorepower connection. Batteries on a vessel may be used to power an inverter to produce AC, which can be used for appliances that require AC power.  Trucks  Shore power, as it relates to the trucking industry, is commonly referred to as \\"Truck Stop Electrification\\" (TSE). The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that trucks plugging in versus idling on diesel fuel could save as much as $3240 annually. 090916 afdc.energy.gov There are currently 138 truck stops 090916 afdc.energy.gov in the USA that offer on-board systems (also called Shore power) or off-board systems (also called single system electrification) for an hourly fee. Auxiliary power units offer another alternative to both idling and shore power for trucks. Aircraft A Rossiya Airlines airplane connected to its ground power unit at Phuket International Airport. Similar to shore power for ships, a ground power unit (GPU) may be used to supply electric power for an aircraft on the ground, to sustain interior lighting, ventilation and other requirements before starting of the main engines or the aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). It is also used by aircraft with APUs if the airport authority does not permit the usage of APUs at its docks or if the carrier wishes to save on the use of jet fuel (which APUs use). This may be a self- contained engine-generator set, or it may convert commercial power to the voltage and frequency needed for the aircraft (for example 115 V 400 Hz).

It is the largest earth- filled dam in the world, and also the largest dam by structural volume. The dam was completed in 1976 and was designed to store water from the Indus River for irrigation, flood control, and the generation of hydroelectric power. The dam is high above the riverbed. The dam's reservoir, Tarbela Lake, has a surface area of approximately . The primary objective of the dam was to supply water for irrigation by storing flows during the monsoon period and subsequently releasing stored water during the low flow period in winter.The installed capacity of the 4,888 MW Tarbela hydroelectric power stations will increase to 6,298 MW after completion of the planned fifth extension financed by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the World Bank. Project description The project is at a narrow spot in the Indus River valley, named after the town of Tarbela.

Five large tunnels were constructed as part of Tarbela Dam's outlet works. Hydroelectricity is generated from turbines in tunnel 1 through 3, while tunnels 4 and 5 were designed for irrigation use. Both tunnels are to be converted to hydropower tunnels to increase Tarbela's electricity-generating capacity. These tunnels were originally used to divert the Indus River while the dam was being constructed. MA hydroelectric power plant on the right side of the main dam houses 14 generators fed with water from outlet tunnels 1, 2, and 3. There are four 175 MW generators on tunnel 1, six 175 MW generators on tunnel 2, and four 432 MW generators on tunnel 3, for a total generating capacity of 3,478 MW. Tarbela Reservoir is long, with a surface area of . The reservoir initially stored of water, with a live storage of , though this figure has been reduced over the subsequent 35 years of operation to due to silting. The Maximum Elevation of the reservoir is 1550 feet (472.44 meter) above MSL and Minimum Operating Elevation is 1392 feet (424.28 meter) above MSL. The catchment area upriver of the Tarbela Dam is spread over of land largely supplemented by snow and glacier melt from the southern slopes of the Himalayas. There are two main Indus River tributaries upstream of the Tarbela Dam. These are the Shyok River, joining near Skardu, and the Siran River near Tarbela. Background Tarbela Dam was constructed as part of the Indus Basin Project after signing of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan. The purpose was to compensate for the loss of water supplies of the eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) that were designated for exclusive use by India per terms of the treaty. The primary objective of the dam was to supply water for irrigation by storing flows during the monsoon period and subsequently releasing stored water during the low flow period in winter. By the mid-1970s, power generation capacity was added in three subsequent hydro-electrical project extensions which were completed in 1992, installing a total of 3,478 MW generating capacity. Construction Generators in the Tarbela Dam Construction of Tarbela Dam was carried out in three stages to meet the diversion requirements of the river. Construction was undertaken by the Italian firm Salini Impregilo. =Stage 1= In the first stage, the Indus River was allowed to flow in its natural channel, while construction works commenced on the right bank where a 1500 feet (457 meters) long and 694.8 feet (212 meters) wide diversion channel was being excavated along with a 105 feet (32 meter) high buttress dam that was also being constructed. Stage 1 construction lasted approximately 2.5 years. =Stage 2= The main embankment dam and the upstream blanket were constructed across the main valley of the river Indus as part of the second stage of construction. During this time, water from the Indus river remained diverted through the diversion channel. By the end of construction works in stage 2, tunnels had been built for diversion purposes. Stage 2 construction took 3 years to complete. =Stage 3= Under the third stage of construction, works were carried out on the closure of diversion channel and construction of the dam in that portion while the river was made to flow through diversion tunnels. The remaining portion of upstream blanket and the main dam at higher levels was also completed as part of stage 3 works, which were concluded in 1976. Re-settlement of people affected by Tarbela Dam It has a reservoir area of about 260 square kilometers and about of land was acquired for its construction. The large reservoir of the dam submerged 135 villages, which resulted in displacement of a population of about 96,000 people,Terminski, Bogumil (2013). \\"Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges\\", Indiana University many of whom were relocated to townships surrounding the Tarbela Reservoir or in adjacent higher valleys. For the land and built-up property acquired under the Land Acquisition Act of 1984, a cash compensation of Rs 469.65 million was paid to those affected. In the absence of a national policy, the resettlement concerns of the people displaced by the Tarbela Dam were addressed on an ad hoc basis. In 2011, many such people had still not been resettled or given land in compensation for their losses by the government of Pakistan, in accordance with its contractual obligations with the World Bank. However, some of those who lost their homes have been settled at Khalabat Township and Kangra Colony, and huge number of displaced people have been setteled at Hamlet, New Jagal, Makhan Colony, Chohar Colony, Hamlet Colony Ghazi, Sakhi Abad, Jhang-Ghora Near Sarai Gadai,New Pind Khankhel, Farooqia, Julian Near Khanpur, Dana Colony Near Kag in Haripur , Pathankot Bahtar, Katha, Dharaik, Musa (Hazro) Islampur Labb Mil, Sultanpur, Utmanabad, Langar Nawazgah, Islamkot Bhaidian, Nazarabad in District Attock and Topi, Rafiqabad (Shewa Adda),Sadry Jadeed, Pak Keya, Hund in District Sawabi, Ahata Usman Khattar(Taxila) Natha Khan Goth (Karachi) District Jhang, District Toba Tek Singh.

These people still have their own culture of Chail(⁄ÜÿßÿØÿ±) Katwa Gosht, Mukha(a game) and Gatka . Lifespan Because the source of the Indus River is glacial meltwater from the Himalayas, the river carries huge amounts of sediment, with an annual suspended sediment load of 200 million tons. Live storage capacity of Tarbela reservoir had declined more than 33.5 per cent to 6.434 million acre feet (MAF) against its original capacity of 9.679 MAF because of sedimentation over the past 38 years. The useful life of the dam and reservoir was estimated to be approximately 50 years. However, sedimentation has been much lower than predicted, and it is now estimated that the useful lifespan of the dam will be 85 years, to about 2060.Lorrai, C and Pasche, N. 'Tarbela Dam-Case Study' Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich: April 2007 Pakistan plans to construct several large dams upstream of Tarbela, including the Diamer-Bhasha Dam. Upon completion of the Diamer-Bhasha dam, sediment loads into Tarbela will be decreased by 69%. Project benefits In addition to fulfilling the primary purpose of the dam, i.e., supplying water for irrigation, Tarbela Power Station has generated 341.139 billion kWh of hydro-electric energy since commissioning. A record annual generation of 16.463 billion kWh was recorded during 1998‚Äì99. Annual generation during 2007‚Äì08 was 14.959 billion kWh while the station shared peak load of 3702 MW during the year, which was 23.057% of total WAPDA system peak. Tarbela-IV Extension Project Tarbela dam extension-IV was planned in June, 2012, and PC-1 was developed for the project . US ambassador Richard Olson offered aid for construction of this project during his visit to Pakistan, in March, 2013. In September 2013, Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority signed a Rs. 26.053 billion contract with Chinese firm Sinohydro and Germany's Voith Hydro for executing civil works on the 1,410 MW Tarbela-IV Extension Project. Construction commenced in February 2014, and was completed in February 2018. This project was constructed on Tunnel No. 4 of Tarbela Dam. It consists of three turbine- generator units, each with a capacity of 470 MW. The project is expected to provide an average of 3.84 billion units of electricity annually to the National Grid. It is intended to help supplement electricity supply during the high-demand summer months. Annual benefits of the project were estimated at about Rs. 30.7 billion. On an annual basis, over 70% of water passing through Tarbela is discharged over spillways, while only a portion of the remaining 30% is used for hydropower generation. The Water and Power Development Authority in Pakistan says the third and last unit at its 1,410-MW Tarbela 4th Extension Hydropower Project has been synchronized with the National Grid.With this extension, the installed capacity of the Tarbela Hydel Power Station has increased to 4,888 MW. =Financing= The project's cost was initially estimated to be $928 million, but the cost was revised downwards to $651 million. The World Bank had agreed to provide an $840 million loan for the project in June 2013. The loan had two components: The first is a $400 million International Development Association loan, which will be lent as a concessional loan at low interest rates. The second portion consists of a $440 million from the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority was to provide the remaining $74 million required for construction, before the project's cost was downwardly revised by $277 million. Interest costs for the loans are estimated to cost $83.5 million. Because of revised lower costs to $651 million from $928 million, the World Bank permitted Pakistani officials to expedite completion of the project by 8 months at a cost of an additional $51 million. Pakistani officials were also permitted to divert $126 million towards the Tarbela-V Extension Project. Tarbela-V Extension Project The Tarbela Dam was built with five original tunnels, with the first three dedicated to hydropower generation, and the remaining two slated for irrigation use. The fourth phase extension project uses the first of the two irrigation tunnels, while the fifth phase extension will use the second irrigation tunnel. Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority sought expressions of interest for the Tarbela-V Extension Project in August 2014, and was given final consent for construction in September 2015. Construction is yet to begin but will require an estimated 3.5 years for completion. The project will require installation of three turbines with a capacity of 470 MW each in Tarbela's fifth tunnel which was previously dedicated to agricultural use. Upon completion, the total power generating capacity of Tarbela Dam will be increased to 6,298 MW. The hydro power project of tunnel 5 has two major components: power generation facilities and power evacuation facilities. The major works included under the project are modifications to tunnel 5 and building a new power house and its ancillaries to generate about 1,800GWh of power annually, a new 50 km of 500kV double-circuit transmission line from Tarbela to the Islamabad West Grid Station for power evacuation, and a new 500kV Islamabad West Grid Station. =Financing= In November 2015, the World Bank affirmed that it would finance at least $326 million of the project's estimated $796 million cost which includes $126 million of funding that was diverted from the $840 million fourth phase extension project after costs for that project were revised downwards. In September 2016, the World Bank approved an additional financing of $390 million for the fifth extension hydropower project of Tarbela dam that will support the scaling up of the power generation capacity by adding 1,410 megawatts to the existing tunnel 5. The project will be financed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), with a variable spread and 20-year maturity, including a six-year grace period. This will be the first World Bank-supported project in South Asia to be jointly financed with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) which will be providing $300m and the Government of Pakistan $133.5m. The total cost of the project is $823.5m.

Kumiƒçiƒá was one of the most prolific Croatian novelists of the realism era and a pioneer of naturalism in Croatian literature. Biography Kumiƒçiƒá was born in Brseƒç, Mo≈°ƒáeniƒçka Draga (now in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County), a small town in Istria, then part of the Austrian Empire. After majoring philosophy at the University of Vienna, he returned to Croatia and worked as a teacher in high schools in Split and Zadar. From 1875 to 1878 he spent two years in Paris and six months in Venice, preparing for his French and Italian teaching examinations. While in France, he came into contact with naturalist writing, primarily through the works of √âmile Zola. Upon returning to Croatia, he spent the period from 1879 to 1883 teaching French and Italian in a Zagreb high school. During that time, he became actively involved with the Croatian literary scene, as well as political activism. An ardent supporter of Ante Starƒçeviƒá's political program and one of his closest associates, he quit the civil service in 1883 in order to pursue a political and literary career. With Matko Laginja and Erazmo Barƒçiƒá he launched the Primorac magazine in Kraljevica. He also worked as the editor of the Croatian Party of Rights' magazines Hrvatska vila (1882‚Äì1883) and Hrvatska (1887‚Äì1888), and published essays, opinion pieces and short stories in them. In 1884 he was elected to Croatian Parliament and he spent most of his political career opposing the Hungarian nationalists. Literary work He wrote many novels and short stories, mostly dealing with working-class people in his native Istria. He also tried to introduce elements of naturalism to Croatian literature in his novels dealing with urban life and Croatian history, but his efforts were often hampered by national romantic tendencies. His works were therefore primarily influenced by realist and romanticist writers of the era such as August ≈†enoa, Alexandre Dumas and Eug√®ne Sue. Nevertheless, as he published an influential and controversial Zolaesque literary essay about the poetics of writing (O romanu, (Eng. On Novel)) in 1883, he was seen by his contemporaries as the pioneer of naturalist writing in Croatian literature. Kumiƒçiƒá's plays were not as successful as his prose, and are described as being of modest artistic value. His literary work is usually divided into three thematic periods: the first period of his writing is marked by novels and short stories that involve romanticized descriptions of hard working Istrians' life - primarily fishermen, farmers and seamen; the bulk of his next literary phase typically deals with urban settings (the so-called city novels), where his naturalist tendencies are most prominent and which mostly involve themes of financial and moral chaos that Croatian bourgeoisie was depicted as caught up in. His last works were historical novels loosely based on important figures of Croatian history.

Career  An ardent romanticist, he collaborated with Auguste Barth√©lemy in many of his satires and wrote a great number of stories, now forgotten. Nowadays he is perhaps best remembered as the co-librettist of the original version in French of Verdi's Don Carlos, which premiered in Paris in March 1867. Also, he was the author of the play La Bataille de Toulouse which Verdi had earlier adapted for his opera La battaglia di Legnano in January 1849. He was noted in his time for his wit and ability to improvise. He produced several pieces at the Paris theatres, and also collaborated with G√©rard de Nerval in adaptations from Shakespeare and in other plays. A friend of Offenbach, he wrote libretti for three of the composer's works. His novella Histoire de ce qui n'est pas arriv√© (1854) is a significant exercise in alternate history, in which M√©ry imagined that Napoleon's life took a different turn in Egypt in 1799. It was translated by Brian Stableford in 2012 and is available in a collection of M√©ry stories entitled The Tower of Destiny. Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, in 1864, invited all the poets of France to display their skill by composing to sets of Bouts-Rim√©s selected for the purpose by Joseph M√©ry. Later in life M√©ry received a pension from Napoleon III.

Random House, 1967)Three Investigators Books: The Mystery of the Silver Spider The Mystery of the Silver Spider is a book in the Three Investigators series. Plot In this episode, the Three Investigators almost run into Prince Djaro with their car. Djaro is the soon to be prince of the fictional European state of Varania, a country which is still very conscious of old traditions and fashions (around the 17th to 19th century). The Investigators form an instant friendship with him. Soon afterwards, they are asked by the United States Secret Service to travel to Varania to keep an eye on Djaro; there are rumors and indications that Djaro is to be dethroned. An important role in the plot is played by the title's Silver Spider, a piece of jewelry which is the most treasured item of Varanian history (comparable to the English Crown Jewels). Soon, the Investigators find themselves actively involved, as the conspirators‚Äîheaded by Duke Stefan, an ambitious nobleman and interim ruler of Varania‚Äîattempt to frame them for stealing the Spider, and by implication sully the name of Prince Djaro and endanger his coronation. Djaro cannot be crowned unless he is wearing the Silver Spider around his neck. Stefan and his men have stolen the real Silver Spider and left an imitation in its place. Bob suffers amnesia in their subsequent flight, and the Silver Spider goes missing. The Three Investigators and a pair of Djaro loyalists hide out, while scheming to expose Stefan's plot and help Djaro to prevail. Despite the fact that all seems hopeless, they finally prevail when Jupe recalls an important piece of Varanian history, which allows them to alert and rally Varania's loyal citizenry. The effort is wrapped up when Jupiter finds the Silver Spider as \\"nothing more than a spider\\", hidden ingeniously by Bob in a real spider's web. Foreign publications * The German version (titled: Die drei ??? und die silberne Spinne), first published in 1984, vastly changes the story's background: the name of the Varanian characters are altered into Swedish; the adventure is set in a place called Magnusstad in Texas; the local traditions (also patterned after Sweden) are passed off as mere tourist attractions; and the historical facts which lead to the happy ending are changed to accounts from a fictional novel, leading to logical plot holes. This alteration was effected by translator Leonore Puschert because of her personal affection for the Swedish language.

Situated in the area of the former Mahra Sultanate, its capital is Al Ghaydah, and it has international borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman. Languages and people A sizeable part of the Mahrah population does not speak Arabic as their primary language. Non-Arabic- speakers primarily speak Mehri or Mahri, which is a Modern South Arabian language, similar to the adjacent Dhofar Governorate of Oman. The people that speak Mahri call themselves 'Mahris', and are presumed to be descendants of the ancient people of 'Ad. Geography The area of Hawf in Al-Mahrah The geography of Al-Mahrah is similar to that of neighboring Dhofar in Oman. Rigid peaks rising to around , and the Empty Quarter Desert lies to the north. Along its coast near the border with Oman, Al Mahrah is affected by the seasonal monsoon, or Khareef. The mountains become water-soaked and the atmosphere becomes moist and foggy as vegetation turns the barren coast into lush valleys and forests. Hauf National Park is located in Al-Mahrah. The mountains here are referred to as either the \\"Mahrat\\" or \\"Hadhramaut\\". HistoryYemeni Civil War= The governorate has remained out of sight of the civil war in Yemen which began in 2014. On 10 September 2016, Three militants in the Al Mahrah governorate declared the formation of a new wilayat belonging to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) via Social Media. Official ISIL media did not acknowledge the declaration. From 2015 to late 2017, Al Mahrah was under the control of the Yemeni 123rd and 137th Mechanized Brigades. From mid-November 2017 onwards, Saudi Arabia began increasing its presence in the governorate, taking control of facilities, Nishtun port, the Sarfit, and Shehen border crossings, and al-Gaydah Airport while establishing military outposts around key infrastructure and coastal areas. On 27 November 2017, Mohammed Abdullah Kuddah, the Governor of Mahra, was replaced by Rajeh Said Bakrit, following his objections against Saudi influence. In 2018, protests erupted in Mahra due to the perceived Saudi occupation. Protests turned into violence in February 2020, as the Saudi forces tried to enforce their control of a seaport in the governate, triggering the anger of local tribes. Saudi airstrikes against the tribes were reported by Yemeni al-Masirah News. Districts The Al Mahrah Governorate is divided into ten separate districts. These districts are further divided into sub-districts and then into villages. *Al Ghaydah District *Al Masilah District *Hat District *Hawf District *Huswain District *Man'ar District *Qishn District *Sayhut District *Shahan District *Rimah District See also * The Hadhramaut Governorate ‚Äì nearby References Category:Governorates of Yemen ","title":"Al Mahrah Governorate"},{"id":"2488922","text":"Reins are used to slow and direct the animal Reins attached to the rings or shanks of a bit A mecate Pure braided rawhide romal reins Split reins attached to a western style snaffle bit Reins are items of horse tack, used to direct a horse or other animal used for riding. They are long straps that can be made of leather, nylon, metal, or other materials, and attach to a bridle via either its bit or its noseband. Use for riding Reins are used to give subtle commands or cues, also known as rein aids. Various commands may signal a turn, ask for a slower speed, request a halt or rein back. Rein aids are used along with leg aids, shifting of body weight, and sometimes voice commands. =Harness reins= On some types of harnesses there might be supporting rings or \\"terrets\\" used to carry the reins over the animal's back. When pairs of equines are used in drawing a wagon or coach it is usual for the outer side of each pair to be connected to the reins and for the inside of the bits to be connected between the pair of horses by a short bridging strap or rope. The driver carries \\"four-in-hand\\" or \\"six-in-hand\\" being the number of reins connecting to the pairs. =Other uses= A single rein or rope may be attached to a halter to lead or guide a horse or packhorse. A long rein called a longe line may be used to allow the horse to move in a circle for training purposes, or for the purpose of a clinical lameness evaluation by a veterinarian. On certain designs of headgear, a third rein may be added to the paired reins, used for leading, longeing, or other specialized or stylistic purposes. The best-known example of a third rein used in the USA is the leading rein of the mecate of the classic bosal hackamore. Types Types of reins include: * Closed reins, or loop reins: reins that are either a single piece or that buckle together at the ends. English riders usually use closed reins. Western riders in timed rodeo events use a single closed rein, as do those who use a romal. A closed rein helps prevent the rider from dropping the reins. * Double reins: The combined use of two pairs of reins, a curb rein and a snaffle rein. This is usually two single (buckled or sewn) reins, though sometimes split reins may be seen on western-style bridles. Double reins are used with a double bridle, with bits such as the Pelham bit and, less often, on some gag bits used for polo. * Draw reins and running reins: long reins, usually made of leather or nylon webbing, that attach to the saddle or the girth, run through the bit rings, and back to the rider. Several design variations, they add mechanical advantage to the rider's hands and may affect the horse's ability to raise or lower its head. Often used in conjunction with a snaffle rein by English riders, usually used alone by western riders. * Lead rein: A third rein used on bridles, not to be confused with the single lead rope of a halter nor the direct rein aid known as the \\"leading rein\\". In North America a third rein is most commonly seen as part of the mecate of a hackamore. In Mongolia it is integral to the bridle, and tied to either a bit ring or a chin strap. * Long reins, longlines, or driving lines: exceptionally long reins which allow the rider to control the horse from a cart, or from the ground, with the handler walking behind the horse. * Mecate: a style of rein seen on a bosal style hackamore made of a single piece of rope that encompasses both a closed rein and a leading rope. * Romal reins: a rein style from the vaquero tradition that incorporates a closed rein with a long quirt at the end. * Side reins: used when longeing a horse, attached from the bit to the saddle or surcingle, they are not meant to be held by the rider. * Split reins: a rein style seen in western riding where the reins are not attached to one another at the ends. They prevent a horse from tangling its feet in a looped rein, particularly when the rider is dismounted. They are considerably longer than closed reins. * Two reins‚Äîreins used on bridles with two reins: ** Snaffle rein: Usually a laced rein that buckles at the center, used on the bradoon of a double bridle, or the upper ring of a pelham bit. ** Curb rein: The rein used at the end of the shank of a curb bit or pelham. Modern curb reins usually buckle together at the ends, though reins of the classical curb were sewn together at the ends to create a single rein. In popular expression In popular culture, to rein in means to hold back, slow down, control or limit. Sometimes the eggcorn, reign in, is used. Usage of the opposing free rein dates back to Geoffrey Chaucer (1343‚Äì1400)The Portable Chaucer Geoffrey Chaucer, Penguin 1975 page 245Merriam Webster definition of \\"free rein\\".

Lastman is considered important because of his work as a painter of history pieces and because his pupils included Rembrandt and Jan Lievens. In his paintings Lastman paid careful attention to the faces, hands and feet.  Early life  Pieter Lastman was born in Amsterdam. He was the fourth child of Pieter Segersz, (1548-1624), a town-beadle who was dismissed in 1578 for being a Catholic. His mother, Barber Jacobsdr, (1549-1624) was an appraiser of paintings and goods.  Education and Italy  His apprenticeship was with Gerrit Pietersz Sweelinck, the brother of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck. Between approximately 1604 and 1607 Lastman was in Italy, where he was influenced by Caravaggio (as were the painters of the Utrecht School a few years later) and by Adam Elsheimer.  Back in Amsterdam  Back in Amsterdam he moved in with his mother in the Sint Antoniesbreestraat, living next to mayor Geurt van Beuningen. Lastman never married although he promised to marry the sister of Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero. Because of his health Lastman moved in with his brother in 1632.  Death  He died the next year after moving in with his brother, and was buried in the Oude Kerk on 4 April 1633.  Students  Because Rembrandt never visited Italy, it is likely that he was influenced by Caravaggio (see e.g. chiaroscuro) mainly or significantly via Lastman. His pupils besides Rembrandt and Lievens were Bartholomeus Breenbergh, Nicolaes Lastman, Pieter Pieterz Nedek and Jan Albertsz Rotius.Pieter Lastman in the RKD Gallery File:Juno Discovering Jupiter with Io by Pieter Lastman.jpgJuno Discovering Jupiter with Io File:Pieter Lastman - Jonah and the Whale - Google Art Project.jpgJonah and the Whale File:Pieter Pietersz.

He continued his studies at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin for three years. After returning in 1910, he married Rose Schramm in 1911, with whom he later had three daughters. He returned to Germany and served in various conducting positions until the United States entered World War I in 1917, after which he moved back to America. From 1918 to 1922, he taught music theory and violoncello at Drake University.Iowa Center for the Arts During the greater part of the time from 1930 to 1956, he continued to compose and publish while he taught at various colleges in New York State, notably the Institute of Musical Art and Ithaca College.Art of the States: Wallingford Riegger In 1957, he was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was investigating communism in the musical world. In 1958, Leonard Bernstein honored him by conducting his Music for Orchestra with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He died in New York in 1961 when he tripped over the leashes of two fighting dogs, resulting in a fall and a head injury from which he did not recover despite treatment. Bernstein said of him in his eulogy, \\"All who knew Wally loved him.\\" His students included Robert Ashley,Kyle Gann, Robert Ashley (Urbana: University of Illinois, 2012), 16. Alan Stout and Merton Brown.  Musical style  Riegger was known for his use of a twelve-tone system, related to that of Schoenberg. He became familiar with the technique through Schoenberg's American student Adolph Weiss. However, he did not use it in all of his compositions and his usage varied from that of Schoenberg, for example in not always using rows with twelve tone and not using transposed forms of the rows. Riegger's Dance Rhythms, for example, did not use these techniques. Aside from Schoenberg, Riegger was also significantly influenced by his friends Henry Cowell and Charles Ives. = Early period = Early on in his career as a composer, the style of his compositions was markedly different from that of his later work, which mostly used the twelve-tone system. His compositions, following those of Goetschius, were somewhat romanticist.Morton, Lawrence. The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 2 (Apr., 1958), pp. 267-269 = Later period = Starting in the mid-1930s, Riegger began to write contemporary dance music. Later, as his career progressed, he began to use Schoenberg's twelve- tone technique more and more often, though he did occasionally revert to his earlier styles. From 1941 on, he focused almost solely on instrumental music. His Symphony No. 3 received the New York Music Critics' Circle Award and a Naumburg Foundation Recording Award.

One of the films from the series is discussed in the article \\"A Cruel Edge: The painful truth about today's pornography, and what men can do about it\\" by Robert Jensen of the School of Journalism at the University of Texas that originally appeared in Ms. magazine. The article describes the female performer with \\"a sloppy situation\\" at the end of the scene, often with spit, mucus or vomit running down their faces. Jensen includes the film as an example of pornography which he describes as dangerous and denigrating to women, and indicative of the trend of presenting women as being in pain during sex. The first film was released in 2000. The series won the AVN Award for 'Best Oral-Themed Series' in 2003 and 2004. In October 2007, one of Gag Factor distributors, Five Star DVD, was found guilty by an Arizona jury of transporting obscene materials, including a Gag Factor title, across state lines.

(2007). Database of extant Ascidiacea. Version of 2 November 2007 They superficially resemble sea squirts but prey on invertebrates such as crustaceans. They also have some unique physical features that distinguish them from the ascidiaceans, including a severely reduced pharynx, the retention of the dorsal nerve cord as adults, the superficial position of their ganglion and the unique histology of the cells of their digestive tracts. The branchial syphon is large and surrounded by six large lobes; the cloacal syphon is small. They live exclusively in deep water and range in size from less than one inch (2 cm) to 2.4 inches (6 cm). Contrary to almost all tunicates, the members of this group are not filter-feeders, and instead capture and eat nematodes and small crustaceans. They are solitary animals, found only in the deep sea.

With an average speed of , it was the fastest narrow gauge passenger train in Australia. It was named to commemorate the city of that name envisioned by Marshall Waller Clifton on Leschenault Inlet 100 years previously. The current hamlet of Australind, a satellite town of Bunbury, has never had a passenger rail service, nor even a railway line. In February 1958, X class diesel locomotives took over. The service was relaunched on 1 October 1960 with onboard catering removing the need for an elongated stop at Pinjarra. On 16 November 1987, the current ADP/ADQ class railcars took over the service reducing journey times to 2 hours 30 minutes. Rolling stock When introduced, the train consisted of new carriages built by the Midland Railway Workshops.

Its capital was Mukalla, and it was divided into six provinces including Al-Mukalla, Ash-Shihr, Shibam, Du'an, the Western Province and Hajr. Apart from Al-Mukalla, Ash-Shihr and Shibam were the Sultanate's major cities. The Sultanate spanned the Indian Ocean coast up to the border of Mahra, encompassed Shabwa, the central valleys and oasis settlements of Hadhramaut, and controlled the southern Empty Quarter. History Asaf Jah VII the Nizam of Hyderabad Deccan with the Al- Quaiti Royal Family Sons of Umar bin Awadh al Qu'aiti, who became a jemadar in the forces of the Nizam of Hyderabad State (now in India), first took the town of Shibam from the rival Kathiris in 1858 to consolidate their rule over all of Hadhramaut. They later conquered Ash-Shihr in 1866 and Mukalla in 1881, largely replacing the Kathiris to control most of the Hadhramaut coast on the Gulf of Aden. They entered into treaty relations with the British in 1888, and created a unified sultanate in 1902 that would become a part of the Aden Protectorate. As Great Britain planned for the eventual independence of South Arabia in the 1960s, Qu'aitis declined to join the British-sponsored Federation of South Arabia but remained under British protection as part of the Protectorate of South Arabia. Despite promises of a UN referendum to assist in determining the future of the Qu'aiti State in South Arabia on 17 September 1967, communist forces overran the kingdom and, in November of that year, the Qu'aiti State was integrated forcibly without a referendum into communist South Yemen. South Yemen united with North Yemen in 1990, again without a referendum, to become the Republic of Yemen.

The soundtracks to the 1976 film The Big Bus, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The Conversation and All the President's Men, and parts of the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack such as \\"Manhattan Skyline\\", are some of his best-known works. His other work includes the score of the 1985 film Return to Oz (the \\"sequel-in-part\\" of The Wizard of Oz), and the stage musical scores of Baby, Big, Closer Than Ever, and Starting Here, Starting Now. Shire is married to actress Didi Conn. Education and early career Shire was born in Buffalo, New York, to Esther Miriam (n√©e Sheinberg) and Buffalo society band leader and piano teacher Irving Daniel Shire. His family was Jewish. His secondary education was at the Nichols School. He met his long-time theater collaborator lyricist/director Richard Maltby, Jr. at Yale University, where they wrote two musicals, Cyrano and Grand Tour, which were produced by the Yale Dramatic Association. Shire also co-fronted a jazz group at school, the Shire-Fogg Quintet, and was a Phi Beta Kappa honors student, with a double major in English and music. He was a member of the Pundits and Elihu and he graduated magna cum laude in 1959. After a semester of graduate work at Brandeis University (where he was the first Eddie Fisher Fellow) and six months in the National Guard infantry, Shire took up residence in New York City, working as a dance class pianist, theater rehearsal and pit pianist, and society band musician while constantly working with Maltby on musicals. Their first off-Broadway show, The Sap of Life, was produced in 1961 at One Sheridan Square Theater in Greenwich Village. He co-wrote The Village Stompers' \\"Washington Square\\" with Bob Goldstein in 1963. Film and television scoring Shire began scoring for television in the 1960s and made the leap to scoring feature films in the early 1970s. He was then married to actress Talia Shire, for whose brother Francis Ford Coppola he scored The Conversation, perhaps his best known score, in 1974. Additional screen credits include Two People, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, The Hindenburg, Farewell, My Lovely, All The President's Men, The Big Bus, 2010, Return to Oz, Short Circuit, Max Dugan Returns, and Zodiac. He composed original music for Saturday Night Fever (for which he received two Grammy Award nominations), and also worked on several disco adaptations including \\"Night on Disco Mountain.\\" He won the Academy Award for Best Song in 1979 for his and Norman Gimbel's theme song for Norma Rae, \\"It Goes Like It Goes.\\" He was also nominated the same year in the same category for \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye,\\" from the motion picture The Promise, with lyrics jointly written by Marilyn and Alan Bergman. In 1979 his song \\"With You I'm Born Again,\\" recorded by Billy Preston and Syreeta, was a top five international hit and stayed on the pop charts for 26 weeks. The Conversation featured a score for piano. On some cues, Shire took the taped sounds of the piano and distorted them in different ways to create alternative sonic textures to round out the score. The music is intended to capture the isolation and paranoia of protagonist Harry Caul (Gene Hackman). The score was released on CD by Intrada Records. For the \\"Main Title\\" of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, Shire set a jazz-funk groove in B-flat minor, and made the lead melodies and chords out of atonal twelve-tone rows in short bursts of variously shaped motives. The soundtrack album was the first-ever CD release by Film Score Monthly. The end titles contain a more expansive arrangement of the theme. Shire's television scores have earned five Emmy nominations. His hundreds of scores for television include: Killer Bees; Raid on Entebbe; The Kennedys of Massachusetts; Serving In Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story; Christopher Reeve's Rear Window; Oprah Winfrey's The Women of Brewster Place; and The Heidi Chronicles. He also composed themes for the television series Alice and McCloud and the 1976-1977 Danny Thomas situation comedy The Practice. Shire's film and television scoring style is often compared to his late counterpart and contemporary Jerry Fielding. Musical theatre Shire at Barnes & Noble, New York with vocalist Sal Viviano. As a pit pianist, Shire played for the original productions of both The Fantasticks and Funny Girl, eventually serving as Barbra Streisand‚Äôs accompanist for several years. He also intermittently conducted and arranged for her (most notably for her television specials Color Me Barbra and The Belle of Fourteenth Street), and over a period of several years she recorded five of his songs. Shire's musical theatre work, always in collaboration with lyricist Richard Maltby, Jr. includes the two off-Broadway revues Starting Here, Starting Now (Grammy nomination for Best Cast Album) and Closer Than Ever (Outer Critic's Circle Award for Best Musical) and the two Broadway shows Baby (Tony nominations for Best Musical and Best Score) and Big (Tony nomination for Best Score). All of these shows have had hundreds of regional and stock productions worldwide. A new musical entitled Take Flight premiered in London at the Menier Chocolate Factory in July 2007, with a separate production in Tokyo in November 2007. Previously concert versions were performed in Australia and Russia. A Stream of Voices, a one-act opera, with libretto by Gene Scheer, for the Colorado Children's Chorale, premiered in June 2008 in Denver. On October 27, 2012, the Broadway-style musical Loving the Silent Tears premiered in Los Angeles, including some songs composed by Shire. Miscellaneous Shire has conducted many orchestras, either for film scores or for pop concerts, including the London Symphony Orchestra, The Los Angeles Philharmonic, the San Francisco Opera Orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and the Munich Symphony. Shire wrote and composed many songs for the hit PBS children's TV series Shining Time Station, which starred his wife Didi Conn along with comedian George Carlin. Shire serves on the council of the Dramatists Guild of America and is a trustee of the Rockland Conservatory of Music and the Palisades (New York) Library. He was inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Personal life Shire has been married to actress Didi Conn since 1982. They have a son, Daniel (born July 1992), who was diagnosed with autism. He has another son, screenwriter Matthew Shire, by ex-wife Talia Shire.

Early life Roux was born and educated in Jena, Germany where he attended university and studied under Ernst Haeckel. He also attended university in Berlin and Strasbourg and studied under Gustav Schwalbe, Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen, and Rudolf Virchow. Although he was trained as a clinical doctor, he spent his career in experimental biology. His doctoral thesis on the embryological development of blood vessels was a seminal early study in biophysical modelling, a milestone in the study of the cardiovascular system. Career and research For ten years Roux worked in Breslau (now Wroclaw), becoming director of his own Institute of Embryology in 1879. He was professor at Innsbruck, Austria from 1889‚Äì95, then accepted a professorial chair at the Anatomical Institute of the University of Halle, a post he retained until 1921. Roux's research was based upon the notion of Entwicklungsmechanik or developmental mechanics: he investigated the mechanisms of functional adaptations of bones, cartilage, and tendons to malformation and disease. His methodology was to interfere with developing embryos and observe the outcome. Roux's investigations were performed mainly on frogs' eggs to research the earliest structures in amphibian development. His goal was to show Darwinian processes at work on the cellular level. Combined with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's 1866 paper on heritable elements in peas, these results highlighted the central role of the chromosomes in carrying heritable material. In cell division the cell divides into two halves with equal number of chromosomes which are similar to parent cell and are diploid in nature. In 1885 Roux removed a section of the medullary plate of an embryonic chicken and tamed it in a warm saline solution for 13 days, establishing the principle of tissue culture which would later be taken up by Ross Granville Harrison and Paul Alfred Weiss. In 1888, Roux published the results of a series of defect experiments in which he took 2 and 4 cell frog embryos and killed half of the cells of each embryo with a hot needle. He reported that they grew into half-embryos and surmised that the separate function of the two cells had already been determined. This led him to propose his \\"Mosaic\\" theory of epigenesis: after a few cell divisions the embryo would be like a mosaic, each cell playing its own unique part in the entire design. After a few years Roux's theory was refuted by the studies of his colleague Hans Driesch and later, with more precision, Hans Spemann showed that, as a rule, Driesch's conclusions were correct, but that results like Roux's may be obtained after intervention in certain planes. Despite this early lapse into a fallacy of reductionism, Roux's pioneering mechanical methodology was to prove most fruitful in 20th century biology.

The government sold its stake in 1992. The company's biggest client has been the government of Tamil Nadu, which purchases agro- products for subsidised distribution through its Public Distribution System. The company has been in poor financial health since about 2002. Its 2006 sales amounted to 2,200 crore, with a net operating loss of 180 crore. SPIC has four business lines: * the fertiliser division, * the pharmaceuticals division which manufactures Penicillin-G Potassium (fermentation-based), and active pharmaceutical ingredients, * the engineering/construction services division offers specialised and turnkey project-based solutions mainly in fertilisers, * the agri-business division, which offers products for agricultural development like hybrid seeds and bio-fertilisers. The company has a strategic stake/or has promoted companies like Thoothukudi Alkali Chemicals, a soda ash manufacturer, Tamil Nadu Petro-products a company which produces liner alkali benzene, Manali Petrochemicals, Indo-Jordan Chemicals and a host of other companies. As per regulatory filings, the promoters (including TN government's investment arm which has 8.2% stake) hold 39.2%, institutions hold 16.2%, public shareholding is 29% and custodians of GDRs hold the balance.

The society is devoted to establishing genealogical infrastructure in Serbia. Members of the foundation, together with other researchers in the region, created the SGS for the promotion of genealogy in its broadest sense. The society strives for objective research and is not engaged in political activities, which it is prohibited from doing under its own statutes. Article 2 of the statutes state * The society‚Äôs goal is to promote and stimulate genealogy and related sciences in the broadest sense of the word in Serbia-Montenegro and the rest of the region. To supply resources both online and offline for the general public and members. * To assist the archives in promoting and assisting in genealogical research in the broadest sense of the word. * The creation of genealogical databases in cooperation with the Archives of Serbia and other related institutes in accordance with the law of the state of Serbia. * The society does not have a financial gain and serves the general interest; it therefore remains politically independent, and will provide in objective research. * The society can not accept donations from political institutes that can jeopardize the independent and objective status of the society. * The society is not affiliated with any church or religious denomination, in order to maintain its objectivity. * To assist in reuniting families that have been scattered due to the civil war in the former-Yugoslavia. * The society also provides for humanitarian aid in the broadest sense of the word. The SGS is not a learned society although many of its members are. Members of the society include historians, sociologists, ethnologists, genealogists, and researchers, as well as amateur genealogists. The SGS has close ties with different archives in Serbia and abroad and other similar organizations. These include: * National Archives of Serbia * National Archives of Montenegro * Macedonian Heraldic Society * Slovenian Genealogical Society * Slovakian Genealogical & Heraldic Society * Croatian Heritage Museum (USA) A primary goal of the SGS is to provide genealogical tools for those want to know more about their family heritage. The SGS runs an online presentation through its official website, which also provides forums, research tools, and allows people to post their family tree online for free through a system called ‚ÄúMoj Rodoslov‚Äù. This is done in accordance with the privacy laws in Serbia. The SGS is also responsible for a validation and accreditation programme to ensure proper quality of research inside Serbia. Serbian Heraldic Society The Serbian Society for Heraldry, Genealogy, Vexillology and Phaleristics, also known as the Serbian Heraldry Society, was established in 1991. The society is the only professional organisation of that kind in Serbia. It is involved in research and work in the fields of heraldry, genealogy, flags, medals and honours, and the more specialized fields of insigniology, archontology and nobilistics. The White Eagle is responsible for Serbia and Montenegro's heraldic arms registry, including responsibility for the design and drawing of the Coats of Arms for most of the states and cities of Serbia. Branches The SGS has different branches in Belgrade, Krusevac, Bosnia, Vojvodina, the Netherlands, and the United States. All branches have their own commissions. Archives The SGS provides information about the available archival resources and assists people in accessing the archival resources. Serbia, unlike neighbouring countries like Croatia, has no microfilmed archives. This makes archival work more difficult. The SGS works with archives in Serbia to make them more accessible while ensuring that archival documents are properly preserved. .

Four of the coins were found to have come from the Dutch East India Company, while the other five were determined to be from the Kilwa Sultanate in Tanzania. Their re-examination has given rise to much speculation about how these medieval African coins came to Australia. Another coin, believed to be from Kilwa turned up on Elcho Island where it was found by Past Masters amateur archaeologist Mike Hermes in 2018. =European discovery and naming= The islands were mapped and named by a Dutch expedition that sailed from Banda Neira to explore the coasts of New Guinea and the South Land following up on discoveries made in 1623 by Jan Carstensz and Willem van Colster (who named Arnhem Land after his ship Arnhem. The expedition used two small yachts that had been prefabricated in the Netherlands and were assembled on the Banda Islands, the Cleen Amsterdam and the Wesel. The ships sailed on 17 April 1636 under the command of Gerrit Thomas Pool, who was killed on New Guinea just 11 days later. The merchant Pieter Pieterszoon took over command and continued the voyage, returning to Banda. Besides the Wesel Eilanden, named after the ship, Pietersen described the Cobourg Peninsula, Melville Island (Roode hoek), and Dundas Strait (which he misidentified as a bay). 170 years later Matthew Flinders decided to retain the name of the islands, though he slightly modified it to Wessel. The cities of Arnhem and Wesel, ultimate sources of the names of Arnhem Land and Wessel Islands, are themselves only 60 km (37 miles) separated. Later history Much of the population of the Wessel Islands was decimated by smallpox, introduced from Makassar, during the 1790s. By the early nineteenth century, many of the Yolngnu clans had been wiped out. During WW2, a string of observational outposts were set up along the Wessel Islands. A minesweeper, the Patricia Cam was sunk by a Japanese float plane on 22 January 1943. A Yolgnu account of the incident, and attempts to save the survivors was taken down from one of the latter, Narritjin Maymuru.

The topography comprises gently-rolling glacial till, with relatively fertile soil. As late as 1880 the island had a resident population of around 450, mainly engaged in fishing and small-scale farming, but today the population has reduced to approximately 20 people. Previously home to Whiddy Island Naval Air Station the island is noted for its oil terminal facilities ‚Äì and the related Whiddy Island Disaster. Economy and tourism As of the 2011 census, the island has a permanent, resident population of 20 people. This increases with visitors arriving during the tourist season; many staying in self-catering accommodation in the form of restored traditional island cottages. The island is linked to the mainland by the local ferry, Ocean Star III, with return trips several times a day. Bike hire is also available on the island, as is a local hackney service. Trips to and from the island and tours of the bay are available during the summer months, incorporating local history, scenery and the indigenous flora and fauna. Walkers and anglers also travel to Whiddy Island, and the walking trails there form part of the Sheep's Head Way walking route. There is one pub, the Bank House, which offers food and live music during the summer months. The present-day economy is mainly fuelled by the tourism, fishing and farming industries. Due to its mild winter temperatures, it has a local reputation for producing the region's earliest potato crop. The island is dominated by a large oil terminal which most recently has been re-purposed to store the Irish strategic oil reserve. History The island's name is of uncertain origin; it could derive from Old Norse Hv√≠t-√∏y, \\"white island.\\" =Military history= Historically, the island was strategically important as it protected Bantry Bay and the bay's deepwater anchorage. As a result, the British authorities built fortified batteries on the island in Napoleonic times. This was to prevent a repeat of the arrival of a French Armada force at Bantry Bay ‚Äì as had occurred in 1796. In the last months of World War I, Whiddy became the site of a US naval air station. The US Navy's Air Wing established a seaplane base on the eastern end of the island; this became operational on 25 September 1918 when the first two Curtiss Model H planes arrived. These air crews patrolled shipping lanes around Fastnet Rock ‚Äì close to where the RMS Lusitania had been sunk some years earlier. One of the base's planes crashed on 22 October 1918, killing one airman, Walford August Anderson. The base had an operational radio station which received messages from as far away as the USA and Russia. With the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the station was no longer required and it closed in January 1919. In all, five Curtiss Model H planes were based in Whiddy during 1918: Number A1072 (a Model H-16 which crashed 22 October 1918), and numbers A1078, A1084, A3466, A4047, A4048. These were \\"pusher\\" type of aircraft with the engine and propeller behind the pilot. These H16 Large America, planes were made by Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, at Buffalo, New York. They were 46 ft. long, had a wing span of 95 ft, two 400h.p. Liberty 12 engines, four Lewis machine guns, a bomb load of four 230 pounders and a crew of five ‚Äì consisting of pilot, two observers, a mechanic and a wireless operator. On 28 June 2014, a memorial was unveiled on the island to Walford August Anderson, the seaplane pilot who lost his life at the American base during World War I. Anderson was part of a crew dedicated to detecting and deterring German U-Boats which posed a threat to British and American vessels, and, in October 1918, Anderson was killed in a crash at sea as his crew returned to base. The stone memorial, located close to the top of the Whiddy pontoon, was unveiled by Lieutenant Colonel Se√°n T. Cosden, Defence Attach√© at the American Embassy, who attended the event ‚Äì along with members of the Irish Air Corps. Whiddy Island oil terminal, seen from the north shore of Bantry Bay in 2003 =Economic history= A large oil terminal was constructed on Whiddy Island in the late 1960s by Gulf Oil. This was designed to accommodate the largest supertankers sailing directly from the Middle East. On Monday, January 8, 1979, a French tanker, the Betelgeuse, was unloading a cargo of crude oil at the terminal when it exploded. The blast and subsequent fire killed 50 people. This was known as the Betelgeuse incident and is considered to be one of the worst maritime disasters in Irish history. The terminal, which had been operational since 1969, was never fully repaired. It was transferred to the Irish government in 1986, after which it was used to hold the Irish strategic oil reserve. The ruins of Pilchard Palaces can also be observed close to the bank, the pilchard industry was a source of huge income for the islanders pre-1900.

The causes of Duncan Smith's fall are often cited as his lack of charisma and impact with the public, the uninspired direction of the party under his leadership, and his previous failure to achieve more than a third of support among Members of Parliament in the 2001 leadership contest. In the event, the Conservative Party coalesced around Michael Howard as replacement leader and there was not a contest to replace Duncan Smith. Fall of Iain Duncan Smith Duncan Smith's leadership was damaged by his lack of support among many of his MPs and the perception that he was a weak, un-charismatic leader. On 14 February 2003, former MP Barry Legg was selected as Conservative Party Chief Executive. He was from the right of the party and replaced modernizer Mark MacGregor, which led to conflict within the party. On 23 February 2003, The Daily Telegraph published a story that members of parliament were considering a vote of confidence due to Duncan Smith's perceived un-electability. On 1 May 2003, Crispin Blunt resigned from the Conservative front bench and demanded a no confidence motion in Duncan Smith, the day before local government elections. On 7 May, Barry Legg resigned amid continuing disquiet. On 13 October 2003, the parliamentary watchdog began an investigation into Duncan Smith's past employment of his wife as his diary secretary. There were allegations that she was on the parliamentary payroll for apparently doing no work. On 18 October, backbench MP Patrick Cormack suggested that Duncan Smith should call a vote of confidence in his leadership. On 22 October, major party donor Stuart Wheeler said there was \\"an overwhelming case\\" to replace Duncan Smith. For a vote of confidence to occur, 15 percent of Conservative MPs (at the time, 25 MPs) had to write to the Chairman of the 1922 Committee demanding the vote. On 26 October, amid mounting claims that the threshold of 25 was about to be reached, Duncan Smith made an appearance on television and dared his opponents to show their hand by the evening of 29 October, or to withdraw their challenge. He also stated that he would not step down if a vote were called. On 28 October, Sir Michael Spicer, chairman of the 1922 Committee, announced that he had received at least 25 votes and the vote of no confidence was held on 29 October 2003. Duncan Smith lost the vote 75‚Äì90. Rise of Michael Howard As soon as the result of the confidence vote was known, MPs David Davis and Oliver Letwin announced that they were supporting former Home Secretary Michael Howard. Kenneth Clarke and Tim Yeo announced they would not be running. Michael Ancram, deputy leader of the party, gave the qualified statement that he would not stand against Howard so long as no other candidate came forward. The prospect of a sole candidate raised many questions as to whether or not ordinary party members would have the opportunity to decide whether they accepted Howard as leader, and some suggested an all-member ballot. No other candidates came forward, and Howard was elected unopposed on 6 November 2003. The board of the Conservative Party decided not to have that ratified by the party membership. The Tories went on to lose the general election in 2005.

It is similar to the action sequences of the 1927 silent film Wings, but the story shown before each mission is different from the plot of the movie. A remake of the original, titled Wings! Remastered, was released in 2014 and 2015 for the Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS platforms. Gameplay Wings features a mixture of gameplay styles including 3D dog fights, top down bombing missions, and diagonally-scrolling (Blue Max-style) strafing sections. It is action oriented, but features the story narrative and atmospheric presentation that typified many of Cinemaware's titles. The game is not based on any real aircraft, but roughly based on the performance of aeroplanes of the era. PlotWings Advance The Game Boy Advance version, Wings Advance, is roughly the same game as the original, although it has been updated with improved graphics, new features, and increased gameplay options. The main difference is that the player can now opt to fly missions as a German pilot, experiencing the war from the opposite perspective. Reception Wings for the Amiga was well received by critics. Computer Gaming World called it \\"a whopping good arcade experience ... exciting, novel, and addicting.\\" In a survey of four World War I flight simulations, the magazine stated that Wings was the best choice for 'arcade' (action) gamers; two surveys of strategy and war games gave it three and a half stars out of five. Review scores in other magazines included 78% from Amiga Action, 79% from Amiga Format, 82.5% from Advanced Computer Entertainment, 87% from Zero, 90% from Amiga User International, 91% from The One, 94% from Computer + Video Games, and 94% from CU Amiga. In 1993, Amiga World ranked Wings third on their list of all-time Amiga game hits.Amiga World 12/1993. In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked Wings for the Amiga as the 65th best game of all time for its \\"masterful combination of arcade action, flight simulation, and cinematic story.\\" Retro Gamer included it on their list of top ten Amiga 500 games, stating: \\"You couldnt ask for a more varied game than Cinemawares Wings ... that was way ahead of its time. Its hard to believe that the game was made in 1990 as the 3D sections looked absolutely incredible and far in advance of anything that had appeared on consoles, PC or even the arcades at the time,\\" and adding its story \\"told of the main characters eerily realistic wartime experiences, provoking an emotional response in the player that is all too rare in retro and modern gaming alike.\\" Wings Advance was well received too, receiving an averaged Metacritic score of 80. Craig Harris of IGN, who did not play the original Amiga version, gave the game an overall score of 7.5/10, calling it \\"a cool collection of three different game designs that, while fun in their own right, can't stand on their own because of gameplay limitations.\\" Wings! Remastered A campaign to create a Wings remake was put on Kickstarter at August 10, 2012 by Cinemaware with an intent to recreate the game in HD for mobile and desktop platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X). It aimed to recreate the original games experience and appeal. It was announced to be developed by Raylight Games, authors of Wings for the GBA, under Cinemaware's production leadership and coordination as Cinemaware first title in development since 2003s Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown. The Kickstarter project was to be funded if at least $350,000 was pledged by September 11, 2012, but was unsuccessful, reaching only $51,740. In November 2013, a second attempt (this time under the title Wings! Remastered) on Kickstarter was successful; earning $91,380 by the end of its 30-day run. The game was officially released by Kalypso Media for Windows and MacOS on October 27, 2014 and was immediately available for Windows on Steam and GOG, though the MacOS version was only available for the game's Kickstarter backers until it was released on the Mac App Store on May 6, 2015.

It is located in the southwest part of the Valley of Toluca at the edge of the Ajusco mountain range that separates it from Mexico City. The name Tianguistenco (Tyanguistengko) is from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúat the edge of the tianguis,‚Äù which is a traditional Aztec market. (Santiago comes from the town's early Spanish name of ‚ÄúVilla de Santiago.‚Äù) The section of the city where the industrial park is still bears this name. Historically, the area was known as having one of the richest and best-stocked markets in the Toluca Valley. Today, it is still home to a large permanent municipal market as well as a weekly tianguis that covers much of the historic center. In addition to the commerce, the municipality is home to a major industrial site that produces commercial trucks. The municipality is also home to a community called Gualupita, famous for its wool items, Santiago Tilapa, which as a patron festival known in Mexico State and the Atenco Hacienda where bullfighting in Mexico got its start. History No archeological finds in this area date before the Postclassic period. However, Olmec era finds in neighboring Almoloya del R√≠o indicate that there was human inhabitants here at least as early as 1300 BCE. Evidence of Teotihuacan settlement or influence was found in the same area. Most of the archeological finds are concentrated on what used to be the shores of a lake in this area and the Tet√©petl Mountain. In the municipality proper, the remains of a population center called Teotenanco appear between 1050 and 1260 C. E. with constructions reminiscent of Teotihuacan. In the center is a ceremonial precinct that was probably the center of a local theocracy. The earliest known ethnic group here is the Matlatzincas. This area, along with the rest of the Toluca Valley, was conquered by Axayacatl and brought into the Aztec Empire in the 1470s. When the Aztec Empire fell in 1521, the lands around Tenochtitlan-Mexico City were mostly divided up into encomiendas. Around 1523, the territory of Tianguistenco was part of the encomienda of Xalatlaco and Atlapulco, which were controlled by Leonel de Cervantes. The encomiendo remained in the family until 1617. It then became a minor province of Matlazingo. For much of the rest of the colonial period, the area would be a dependency of a number of political entities such as Metepec and Tenango del Valle, with parts of the current municipality such as the communities of Coatepec and Huhutitl√°n belonging to Malinalco. Many of the indigenous villages were governed under a system called the Republica de Naturales (Republic of Natives), which gave a certain amount of autonomy. This republic was initiated in the first half of the 17th century with records indicating that Tom√°s de Alarc√≥n as governor of Tianguistenco. However, by 1778, this lateral governing system was abolished by the viceroy. Economically, the most important center for much of the colonial period was the Purisima Concepcion Hacienda, which was established by Hern√°n Cort√©s himself on part of his lands as the Marques of the Valley of Oaxaca. It remained in Cort√©s family hands. However, the rest of the lands that make up the current municipality switch hands constantly among a number of political and economic entities over the colonial period. By the second half of the 18th century, the town of Tianguistenco had grown in size and importance to merit a customs house that covered the areas of San Nicol√°s Coatepec, San Lorenzo Huehuetitl√°n, San Pedro Tlaltizap√°n, San Bartolom√© Capulhuac and Santa Mar√≠a Coaxusco. The town also became the center for mail service in the area around the same time. The parish church was begun in 1756. During the Mexican War of Independence, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla passed through here in 1810 with his army. In 1812, guerillas were operating in the nearby Ajusco Mountains under Manuel Gonzalez and Ignacio L√≥pez Ray√≥n was stationed here for a time. Most of the fighting seen here were incursions by guerrillas in the mountain areas. The first municipal government under the Cadiz Constitution was formed here in 1820 with the town of Tianguistenco as the seat. This government would recognize Mexican Independence in 1821. In 1825, this municipality was reorganized as part of the State of Mexico. This municipality included the communities of de Xalatlaco, Capulhuac, San Pedro Tlaltizap√°n, Santiago Tilapa, La Magdalena Los Reyes, Santa Cruz Atizap√°n, Almoloya del R√≠o, Texcalyacac, San Pedro Techuchulco and Santa Mar√≠a Guadalupe Yancuictlalpan. The first of these to break away and form its own municipality was Capulhuac in 1827, with the community of Tlaltizap√°n joining Capulhuac shortly thereafter. Almoloya del R√≠o, Santa Cruz Atizap√°n, San Mateo Texcalyacac and San Pedro Techuchulco were separated by the state legislature in 1847 to form the municipality of Almoloya del Rio. Santa Mar√≠a de la Asunci√≥n Xalatlaco separated in 1872. The community of Tianguistenco was officially declared a town in 1878 with the formal name of Tianguistenco de Galeana. San Nicol√°s Coatepec and San Lorenzo Huehuetitl√°n were added to the municipality in 1857 and 1863 with Tlaltizap√°n returning in 1891. During the Reform War, the town and the Purisima Concepcion Hacienda were sacked in 1857. Many here supported the Conservative cause forming the Puente Brigade. This brigade fought in a number of battles including the occupation of Lerma. The municipal palace was begun in 1903 and completed in 1910. The inauguration of the palace formed part of the Centennial celebrations here. During the Mexican Revolution, the town initially supported Francisco I. Madero against Porfirio D√≠az. However, Emiliano Zapata soon grew unsatisfied with Madero and the Liberation Army of the South began to fight anew. The town became Zapatista. Genovevo de la O and federal forces fought over the town several times with possession changing hands until the end of the war. The municipal seat was declared a city by the state legislature in 1996. The family of Carlos Hank Gonzalez, a powerful political figure in the second half of the 20th century, has bought a significant quantity of land in Tianguistenco, leading to the somewhat derogatory term of ‚ÄúHankilandia‚Äù for the municipality. In the late 1990s, the community of San Nicolas Coatepec, one of the larger communities outside the municipal seat, sought to separate from Tianguistenco claiming they were marginalized due to the fact that most here are indigenous. They proclaimed the community as an ‚Äúautonomous municipality.‚Äù However, this auto proclamation was not accepted by municipal or state authorities. This same community denounced the offering of lands to the family the local PRI politicians to Jorge Hank Rhon in 2001. The community claims the lands are communal property. In the early 21st century, a major section of the highway linking Santa Cruz Atizapan and Santiago Tianguistenco was opened to alleviate chronic traffic problems in the area. This section is part of a large highway built to link western Mexico City with the state of Morelos. Prior to its construction, traffic was distributed among the many local roads. Another highway connection Tianguistenco with Lerma, called Lerma-Tres Marias, has been held up due to environmental concerns. The city Church of Santa Mar√≠a del Buen Suceso The town has narrow streets and some traditional adobe houses with red tile roofs can still be seen. The historic center of town is filled with gardens public buildings and churches based on past architectural styles. The parish church is called Santa Mar√≠a del Buen Suceso and was constructed in the 18th century and faces the main plaza. The church is ‚ÄúUltra-Baroque.‚Äù The facade has two bodies, and columns three different decorative styles. The cornice is formed by sections of entablature over the capitals of each column. The church was financed by Jos√© de la Boda, a wealthy French miner and has a similar appearance to the Santa Prisca Church in Taxco. The bell towers are inspired by those of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City. This church is the most important historically but there are more than a dozen other temples in town, some of which date from the 16th century, that have been designated as historical monuments by INAH. To the right of the parish church, also facing the plaza, is the municipal palace. Across from the palace is the municipal market. Typical dishes for the area, which can be found in the market, include moles, tamales, and barbacoa. During the rainy season, dishes based on wild mushrooms, fresh corn and green fava beans are popular. Fruit liquors are produced and consumed here. One of the specialty is a sweet paste made from tejocotes wrapped in corn husks, amaranth bars and a kind of brittle made with squash seeds. Tuesday is market day, when stands set up on the streets of the city (called a tianguis) supplement the goods sold in the permanent market. The ancient market here was one of the richest and most complete of the pre-Hispanic era. Today the tianguis market tradition is the best-preserved in the state, according to historian Alva Margarita Cervera, attraction about 3,500 merchants for the day. The city is the regional commercial center as well as a center for pilgrims on their way to Chalma. Guadalupe Yancuictlalpan, is an integrated suburb of the municipal seat on the south side. The community is locally known as Gualupita (contraction of Guadalupita) due to the church dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe. It is famous for this wool knit and woven items, the only craft maintained in the municipality. Woven items are made on colonial style wood looms many of which have been in families for generations. Textile arts here date back at least to 1472 using fibers from the maguey plant. After the Spanish arrival, these fibers were mixed with wool. Each weekend in this community, hundreds of craftsmen come to offer their wares such as sweaters, vests, scarves, hats and coats with prices ranging from 20 pesos to 4,500, made from wool, cotton and some synthetic fibers but the most representative pieces are made with undyed wool. The most expensive items are custom-made, with a fine coat costing as much as 6,000 pesos. Traditional designs found on many items are generally from the Mazahua, Otomi and Nahua ethnic groups. The community holds an Atole Festival on 2 May. On this day, residents of Gualupita head to neighboring Ocuil√°n to bring back 30 kilos of laurel branches one by one to the town church. When the first participant arrives back to Gualupita, the church bells sound out. The annual event has had as many 1,500 participants. The major economic engine for the municipality is the Daimler Veh√≠culos Comerciales Mexico plant, locally referred to simply as ‚ÄúLa Mercedes.‚Äù The building has been in operation since 1969 and is the only place where the Coronado tractor trailer is made. It began as a factory named Autocar. Ten years later it became a store affiliated with the Famsa chain until it was acquired by Mercedes-Benz in 1991. Since then, the factory has produced more than 272,000 vehicles. The trucks are primarily produced for export, mostly to the United States, Canada and Latin America. The municipality As municipal seat, the city of Santiago Tianguistenco is the local governing authority for almost sixty other named communities with a combined territory of 121.53km2. Less than a third of the municipality's population lives in the town proper. The municipality is bordered by the municipalities of Metepec, Capulhuac, Ocoyocac, Xalatlaco, Ocuilan, Joquicingo, Texcalyacac, Almoloya del R√≠o, Santa Cruz Atizapan, San Antonio la Isla, Calimaya, Chapultepec and Mexicaltzingo with the Federal District to the east and the state of Morelos to the south. The municipality lies in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the sub-province of the Lakes and Volcanoes of Anahuac. 35% of the municipality is mountainous, 30% is arable and the rest is developed. The topography of the municipality varies due to its size. The eastern portions are highest as they are in the Ajusco mountains with an average altitude of over 3,600 meters above sea level. The rest of the municipal is part of the Lerma River plain, which close to level, sloping slightly at around 2,600 meters. Within the municipality there are a number of small volcanoes such as Los Cuates, Santiago Tilapa, Las Ratas, Teconto and others that break up the plains area. The main surface water is the Lerma River, which crosses the municipality from north to south, although there are a large number of small intermittent streams, and the smaller Jalatlaco River. Along this river are waterworks constructed in the 1940s to supply water to Mexico City. There also a number of wells here with the same purpose. The climate here is fairly cold (C(E) (m) (w)) with freezing temperatures expected around 100 days per year between October and May. Wild vegetation varies depending on the altitude. The mountain regions have forests of oak, pine and fir, with the lower levels having scrub and grasslands. Most fauna here is small and medium-sized mammals such as coyotes, skunks, rabbits and squirrels with reptiles such as rattlesnakes and birds such as crows, ducks and quail. The area used to have deer, buzzards and wildcats, but these have disappeared. The major economic engine for the municipality is the Daimler Veh√≠culos Comerciales Mexico plant, locally referred to simply as ‚ÄúLa Mercedes.‚Äù The main Industry is automotive production centered around vehicle manufacture, design, and vehicle R&D.; The building has been in operation since 1969 and is the only place where the Coronado tractor trailer is made. It began as a factory named Autocar. Ten years later it became a store affiliated with the Famsa chain until it was acquired by Mercedez-Benz de Mexico in 1991. Since then, the factory has produced more than 272,000 Mercedes-Benz vehicles. A Daimler Trucks factory is also located in this facility, which produces its Freightliner Trucks in its own plant. The trucks are primarily produced for export, mostly to the United States, Canada and Latin America. Other industry consists of food processing of milk and meat products as well as industries located in the Parque Industrial Santiago Tianguistenco. Agriculture is still a significant economic activity of the municipality growing corn, carrots, oats and fava beans. Livestock raised here include cattle, sheep, pigs and domestic fowl. There is one ejido belonging to the community of San Pedro Tlaltizapan on the west side of the Lerma River. This was established in 1978. There are a number of significant locations outside of the city area. One of these is the Sanctuary of Santiago Tilapa. Each year in August this community holds their celebration of the feast day of their patron saint, which has become known in the State of Mexico. The tradition of a dance group called the Aventureros began in the mid-20th century when a group of muleteers, peasants, shepherds and others began a dance tradition that gained a following called the ‚ÄúDance of the Muleteers.‚Äù The dance is formed by sixteen sequential squares called ‚ÄúThe arrival,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the name of God,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe sale,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe unloading‚Äù and others. The dancers have roles such as ‚Äúthe patron,‚Äù ‚Äúthe load bearers,‚Äù ‚Äúthe sufferers‚Äù and more, each with his own outfit and colors to indicate his part. The Atenco Hacienda is not the largest hacienda in Mexico, but it is the oldest, according to a plaque on its main gate. It is the oldest livestock producer on the continent, a tradition still maintained, mostly producing bulls for bullfights. The hacienda was founded by a cousin of Hern√°n Cort√©s called Juan Guti√©rrez Altamirano around 1528 with an area of about 30,000 hectares and 2,000 workers. It continued to operate until the Mexican Revolution when it was divided into sixteen parts. The main house and other buildings now only occupy about 3,000 square meters with five workers. Originally, fighting bulls were brought to Mexico in the 16th century supposedly as ‚Äúguard animals‚Äù These bulls were of Navarre stock brought from Spain. As these animals were unknown in the New World, native peoples of the surrounding areas would not enter the hacienda's land for fear of them. The Casco of the hacienda is considered to be the origin of Mexican bullfighting, when the corrals for the bulls were built, along with the chapel in 1550. The first formal bullring in Mexico was built here in 1820, called El Tenadero. The first Mexican bullfighter to fight in Madrid, Ponciano Diaz, was a native of this area who went to Spain to try his luck in 1880. Some of the bullfighters who came through here include Juan Belmonte, Rodolfo Gaona and Rafael G√≥mez Ortega.

The pledged items must be readily marketable; in particular, the securities 'eligible for collateral' which are registered on lists. Lending is via central banks. As a general rule, the Lombard rate (interest rate) is around one per cent above discount rate. The pledging of securities means that the credit institutions have the opportunity of acquiring money in the short term from central banks.  Etymology  The term comes from the Lombards, a people who conquered Italy in the 6th century, and settled in the northern region that became known as Lombardy. The wealthy cities in this region were the birthplace of modern banking, and many of their inhabitants became notable in Middle Ages throughout Western Europe as bankers, money-lenders and pawn-brokers; London's Lombard Street (1598) originally was occupied by \\"Lombard\\" bankers.Etymology online  Controversy  One prominent role of Lombard credit is in use by the Federal Reserve System of the United States of America. Traditionally, the discount rate, or the rate charged by the Fed to member banks in need of funds (ostensibly to maintain the required reserve ratio), was lower than the target federal funds rate, or the rate charged among banks for the same type of overnight credit. This meant that banks could borrow from the central bank at a lower rate than they could from each other, which somewhat conflicts with the central bank's role as a \\"lender of last resort\\". A discount rate lower than the rate typically charged by another bank opened the possibility of arbitrage and thus required extra scrutiny of potential borrowers. The Federal Reserve Board of the United States switched to a so-called \\"Lombard facility,\\" in which the discount rate is actually higher than the targeted federal funds rate, thus creating an economic incentive for banks to look elsewhere before asking to borrow from the Fed.The Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window & Payments System Risk Website A 2011 economic brief from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said many bank executives and market participants perceive a stigma attached to borrowing from the discount window, so while the vast majority of federal funds loans occur below the discount rate (at or near the target federal funds rate), there have been instances when banks have paid above-market rates (particularly, rates at or even above the discount rate) for federal funds.

The province comprised Illyria/Dalmatia and Pannonia. Illyria included the area along the east coast of the Adriatic Sea and its inland mountains. With the creation of this province it came to be called Dalmatia. It was in the south, while Pannonia was in the north. Illyria/Dalmatia stretched from the River Drin (in modern northern Albania) to Istria (Croatia) and the River Sava in the north. The area roughly corresponded to modern northern Slovenia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and coastal Croatia. Pannonia was the plain which lies to its north, from the mountains of Illyria/Dalmatia to the westward bend of the River Danube, and included modern Vojvodina (in modern northern Serbia), northern Croatia and western Hungary. As the province developed, Salona (near modern Split, Croatia) became its capital. Name and etymology Illyricum is a Latin term derived from Greek Illyria (·º∏ŒªŒªœÖœÅŒØŒ±) and Illyris (·º∏ŒªŒªœÖœÅŒØœÇ). A distinction was also made between Illyris Barbara or Romana, which comprised the Adriatic coast down to today's northern Albania, and Illyris Graeca, which was the rest of Albania, later called Epirus Nova. This latter area derived its name from the fact that, being close to Greece, it was influenced by the Greeks.Mitchell, A. An ancient geography, classical and sacred, p. 215Smith, W. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography It was part of the Roman province of Macedonia. Geography Illyrian wars. Illyria stretched from the River Drilon (Drin) in modern northern Albania to Istria (in modern Croatia and Slovenia) and the River Savus (Sava) in the north. It comprised the coastal plain, the mountains of the Dinaric Alps which stretch along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea for 645 kilometres (401 miles) with a width of about 150 kilometres) and, in the north-west, the Istrian Peninsula. There were numerous islands off the coast, but they lacked drinking water. The mountains were cultivated towards the coast, but for the most they were barren. Lack of water and poor or arid soil made much of Illyria poor agricultural area and this gave rise to piracy. The interior of the southern part of Illyricum (central and southern Albania) was more fertile. Illyria was inhabited by dozens of independent tribes and tribal groupings. Most of them were labelled as Illyrians. In the north there were also Celtic tribes.Wilkes, J. The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe), (1996) p. 208Chapot, V; Parker, E. E. The Roman World History of civilization (1997), p. 268Smith, W. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography The Pannonian (or Carpathian) plain in the north was more fertile. Its tribes were labelled as Pannonian. Archaeological finds and toponyms show that the Pannonians differed culturally from the Illyrians and the eastern Celts who lived to their west, in what is now Austria. They were later Celticised following a Celtic invasion of the northern part of the region at the beginning of the 4th century BC. Some tribes in the area (the Eravisci, Scordisci Cotini, Boii, and Anartii) were Celtic. The Pannonians also had cultural similarities with the Illyrians. Iron mining and production was an important part of their economy in the pre-Roman days.Mocsy, S. F, \\"Pannonia and Upper Moesia\\", in A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire, p. 152Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe), p. 203 Historical backgroundIllyrian Wars= The Romans fought three Illyrian wars between 229 BC and 168 BC. The First Illyrian War (229‚Äì228 BC) broke out due to concerns about attacks on the ships of Rome's Italian confederates in the Adriatic Sea by Illyrian pirates and the increased power of the Ardiaei (an Illyrian tribe in today's Montenegro and northern Albania). With a powerful fleet The Ardiaei had invaded the Greek cities of Epidamnos (modern Durr√´s, Albania) Pharos (Stari Grad, Croatia), the island of Corfu and attacked Elis and Messenia in the Peloponnese and Phoenice in Epirus, whose trade with Italy was thriving. Numerous attacks on Italian ships prompted Rome to intervene. The Romans freed the Greek cities and attacked the Ardiaei. Peace terms were agreed. In 220 BC the Ardiaei carried out attacks on the Greek coast in the west, south and southeast. They then attacked Roman allies in southern Illyria. This led to the Second Illyrian War (219‚Äì18 BC), which Rome won. In 168 BC, during the Third Macedonian War (171‚Äì168 BC) between Rome and the Kingdom of Macedon, the Ardiaei joined the fight against the Romans, but they were quickly defeated (Third Illyrian War, 168 BC). The Romans imposed a tribute which was half the amount they had been paying in taxes to their king (who was deposed) on the cities which had fought them and five neighbouring tribes which also had fought them. The cities and a tribe which had sided with the Romans were exempted from this tribute. The territory of the Ardiaei and the neighbouring tribes was declared free and was divided into three cantons. Each was headed by its own council.Livy, The History of Rome, 45.26.11-15 =From the Illyrian Wars to the Roman Civil Wars= We only have limited and scattered information about the subsequent Roman involvement in Illyria for the next 120 years. It seems that the attention of the Romans shifted further north, to today's Dalmatia (much of the coastal part of Croatia). Most of what we know is through the work of Appian. In 156 BC the Dalmatae made an attack of the Illyrian subjects of Rome (it is not clear what Appian meant by this) and refused to see Roman ambassadors. The consul Gaius Marcius Figulus undertook a campaign against them. While he was preparing his camp the Dalmatae overpowered his guards and drove him out of the camp. He fled through the plain as far as the river Naro. He then hoped to catch the Dalmatae unawares as they went back home for the winter, but they had assembled because they had heard of his arrival. Still, he drove them into the city of Delminium. He could not attack this strongly fortified town. Thus he attacked other towns which were partly deserted because of the Dalmatae concentrating their forces at Delminium. He then returned to Delminium and catapulted flaming projectiles. The greater part of the town was burned.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 11 Livy's Periochae recorded the campaign of Gaius Marcius Figulus and noted that in the next year, 155 BC, the consul Cornelius Nasica subdued the Dalmatae.Livy, Periochae, 47.9 In 135 BC two Illyrian tribes, the Ardiaei and the Palarii, made a raid on Roman Illyria while the Romans were busy with the Numantine War in Hispania and the First Servile War in Sicily. The Romans sent ambassadors, but they refused to negotiate. The Romans levied an army of 10,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. The Illyrians sent ambassadors to plea for pardon. Rome asked for indemnities for the people who had been attacked. Since the Illyrians were slow to respond the consul Servius Fulvius Flaccus marched against them. According to Appian this was only a minor expedition.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10 It is likely that by Roman Illyria Appian meant four coastal towns which had a large Roman population. According to Appian in 129 BC the consul Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus and Tiberius Pandusa waged a war with the Iapydes who lived on the Alps (in the north of Illyria), and seemed to have subjugated them. However, according to Livy, Sempronius Tuditanus was at first unsuccessful, \\"but the defeat was compensated by a victory won through the qualities of Decimus Junius Brutus (the man who had subdued Lusitania).\\"Livy, Periochae, 59.20 Tuditanus was granted a triumph. He immortalized his victories with a dedication to the river god Timavus in Aquileia which bore a victory inscription in Saturnian verse, two fragments of which were found in 1906.Inscriptions from the time of the Roman Republic, translated by E.H.Warmington (1940) CIL I¬≤ 652 In a passage Appian wrote that in 119 BC the consul Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus waged war against the Dalmatae even though they had not done anything wrong because he wanted a triumph. They received him as a friend and he wintered among them at the town of Salona. He returned to Rome and was awarded a triumph. In another passage he noted \\"Lucius Cotta (the other consul for that year) and Caecilius Metellus seemed to have subjugated the Segestani. He also noted that both the Iapydes and the Segestani revolted again shortly afterward. Caecilius Metellus was given the agnomen Dalmanticus, In 115 BC the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, conducted operations in Gallia Cisalpina against the Ligures in the west and against the Carni and Taurisci (two Gallic tribes which lived in today's Slovenia) in the east.Cornelius Nepos, De Viris Illustribus, 72.7 In 113 BC the consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo was sent to face an invasion by the Cimbri (a Germanic tribe) which had entered into Illyricum and then into Noricum. He was defeated at the Battle of Noreia in Noricum.Appian, The Gallic Wars, 13Strabo, Geographia, V, 1.8 In 78‚Äì76 BC a certain Gaius Cosconius was sent into Illyricum as proconsul. He fought there for two years, reduced a great part of Dalmatia and seized Salona (near today's Solin, near Split, Croatia), one of the major towns in Dalmatia.Eutropius, Compendium of Roman History, 6.4Orosius, Seven Books of History Against the Pagans, 5.23 Later the Roman settlement of Colonia Martia Iulia Salona was founded, probably after the Roman civil wars. = Caesar's governorship = In 59 BC the lex Vatinia assigned to the consul, Julius Caesar, the proconsulship of Gallia Cisalpina (in northern Italy) and Illyricum and the command of three legions based at Aquileia for a period of five years. When the proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis died, the senate also gave Caesar the proconsulship of that province and the command on a legion which was stationed there, also for five years. Caesar took on his proconsulships in 58 BC. Only Gallia Narbonensis was a province in the sense of a formal administrative unit. The other two were provinces in the sense of areas of military command which were assigned to high military commanders in areas where there were rebellions or threats of attacks. In the past Liguria (which often rebelled), Bruttium (today's Calabria, where there was a chance of unrest) and Gallia Cisalpina (in case of rebellions or possible invasions) had been assigned as provinces in this sense. Aquileia was a Roman town in north-eastern Italy which was founded in 180/181 BC as an outpost to defend northern Italy against hostile and warlike peoples to the east: the Carni (Gauls who lived on the mountains of Noricum), the Taurisci (a federation of Gallic tribes which lived in today's Carniola, northern Slovenia), the Histri (a Venetic tribe, with ties with Illyrians which lived in the Istrian peninsula), and the Iapydes (who lived east of Istrian Peninsula and inland from the Liburnians; the latter lived on a stretch of the Adriatic coast south of the Istrian peninsula and between the rivers Arsia (Ra≈°a) and Titius (Krka). The Carni settled in their area around 186 BC, invaded the plain on north-eastern Italy and founded the fortified town of Akileja. The Romans forced the Carni back to the mountains. They destroyed their settlement and founded Aquileia nearby, which was named after Akileja. It was also about 6 km from where an estimated 12,000 Taurisci had tried to settle in 183 BC. For the foundation of Aquileia 3,000 families were settled there. In 169 BC 1,500 more families were settled there. This settlement was grown into a sizable town and three legions were stationed there because of its strategic importance for the defence of northern Italy. The fact that Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum were the areas of command initially assigned to Caesar could indicate that Caesar had an eye on Illyricum to attain military glory with which he could bolster his political clout in Rome. Burebista had led the Dacians from what is today's Romania to the conquest of the Hungarian Plain west of the River Danube and close to Illyricum and Italy. However, Burebista stopped, returned to Transylvania and turned his attention eastwards. Caesar's attention turned to troubles in Gaul and then he embarked on his Gallic Wars (58‚Äì50 BC). After the defeat of the Belgae of northern Gaul in 57 BC Caesar thought that Gaul was at peace and went to Illyricum to visit the country and to acquaint himself with it. However, war broke out in Gaul again and he went back there. When he went to Gallia Cisalpina in 54 BC to winter there he heard that the Illyrian tribe of the Pirustae raided nearby territories. He went to Illyricum and levied troops from Illyrian peoples. The Pirustae claimed that none of the raids were due to public decisions and offered compensation. Caesar asked for hostages and said that if they were not handed over he would wage war. The Pirustae complied and Caesar appointed arbitrators to assess the damages done to the other peoples and set a penalty. He returned to Italy and then went to Gaul.Julius Caesar, The Gallic Wars, 3.7, 5.1 = Illyricum during Caesar‚Äôs Civil War = Appian wrote that while Caesar was in Gaul the Dalmatae seized Promona from the Liburnians, who appealed to Caesar. The Dalmatae refused his request to leave the city and he sent a strong detachment. However, it was routed. Caesar did not pursue the matter further because he was occupied with his civil war. This suggests that this event occurred in late 50 BC, just before the beginning of this war.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 12 In January 49 BC Caesar started a civil war against the forces of the senate led by Pompey. Pompey fled to Greece to gather forces to fight the war. He controlled the Roman navy. Still, in 48 BC Caesar managed to sail his troops across the Adriatic Sea and land at Palaeste (Palas√´, southern Albania). Marcus Octavius, one of Pompey's admirals, went to Salona (Solin, near Split, Croatia) with his fleet. He persuaded the people of the island of Issa (Vis, Croatia) to defect to him. He failed to persuade the Romans in Salona and surrounded it with five camps to besiege it. The town was short of grain and sent envoys to Caesar to ask for help. As the siege continued the inhabitants stormed the nearest camp. Then they seized the other four and killed many of the enemy. Octavius was forced to withdraw to his ships and as the winter was approaching he sailed back to Dyrrachium (Durr√´s, Albania) to rejoin Pompey.Caesar, The Civil War, 3.6 In the summer 48 BC Caesar sent Quintus Cornificius to Illyricum as a quaestor. This region had been quiet. However, now the Romans in the local towns supported Caesar while the natives supported Pompey. Caesar wrote that the area was quite poor and could barely support an army. Moreover, it was exhausted due to the fighting in the Battle of Dyrrachium between Caesar and Pompey in the south of the region (in July 48 BC) and due to rebellions. Cornificius defended Illyria and recovered it for Caesar. He stormed several mountain strongholds which were used for carrying out raids. When Marcus Octavius took refuge on the Illyrian coast after the Battle of Pharsalus (in Greece, where Caesar defeated Pompey in August 48 BC), Cornificius, with the help of the people of Iadera (Zadar (Croatia) who were loyal to Caesar, scattered his ships and added those he captured to those of his Illyrian allies, thus assembling a small fleet. Since the many Pompeian soldiers had taken refuge in Illyricum after the mentioned battle, Caesar ordered Aulus Gabinius to go to Illyricum with his force, join Cornificius and repulse any enemy operations in the region. If larger forces were needed for this, he was to go to Greece, where continued resistance was to be expected. Gabinius marched in the winter. He did not get supplies for his army because the locals were hostile and because storms in the Adriatic Sea held back supply ships. Gabinius had to storm towns and strongholds in adverse weather and suffered reverses. He had to retreat to Salona, on the coast, which had many Roman inhabitants. On his way he was attacked and routed, losing 2,000 soldiers. He went to Salona with the remnants of his force. He fell ill and died a few months later.Julius Caesar, The Alexandrian War, 42-43 Appian wrote that Aulus Gabinius led fifteen cohorts (which would amount to about 7,800 soldiers) and 3,000 cavalry and that, again, being busy with the civil war, Caesar did not pursue the matter further. Marcus Octavius sought to take advantage of this to seize Illyria. Cornificius asked Publius Vatinius, who was in Brundisium (Brindisi, southern Italy), to come to his aid and informed him that Octavius was making alliances with the locals and attacking Caesarian garrisons, sometimes with his fleet and sometimes with land forces, using native troops‚Äîthe Caesarians were Caesar's supporters. Vatinius asked a Caesarian lieutenant in Greece to send him a fleet, but this was taking too long. He armed some civilian ships whose size was poorly suited for fighting and added them to the few warships he had and left for Illyria. He did not pursue Octavius so as not to be delayed. Instead, he recovered some coastal towns which had sided with Octavius and by-passed others, proceeding as quickly as he could. In this way he managed to force Octavius to abandon his attack on Epidaurus (Epidaurum in Latin, modern Cavtat, near Dubrovnik, Croatia) with his approach. Octavius thought that his fleet was superior to the small ships of Vatinius and sailed to the island of Tauris. Vatinius pursued him without knowing that he had gone to that island. While the sea was rough he was caught unawares when the fleet of Octavius appeared ready for battle and was superior in formation. Vatinius decided to try his luck and attacked first, charging Octavius‚Äô flagship with one of his warships. The crush was hard and the ram of the latter was smashed away. The battle was fought at close range in narrow sea. Vatinius had the better and at nightfall the remnants of the enemy fleet fled. The next day Vatinius refitted his ships and 85 captured ships and the day after that he set off for the island of Issa (Vis, Croatia), thinking that Octavius had retreated there. When he got there the islanders surrendered and told him that Octavius had left for Sicily. Having cleared the Adriatic Sea, he returned to Brundisium.Julius Caesar, The Alexandrian War, 44-47 In 45 BC Caesar was planning a war against Parthia. The Illyrians, feared punishment again (this time for routing Aulus Gabinius) because Caesar was going to cross the south of their land to reach Parthia. They sent envoys to Rome to ask Caesar for an alliance. Caesar replied that he could not make friends because of what they had done, but that he would grant pardon if they paid a tribute and handed over hostages. They agreed and Publius Vatinius was sent to impose a light tribute and receive the hostages with three legions and a large cavalry unit. After the murder of Caesar in 44 BC and the ensuing instability in Rome, the Illyrians no longer feared Roman power. They ignored Vatinius and when he tried to use force they routed five cohorts led by Baebius, one of his lieutenants, who also died. Vatinius fled to Dyrrhachium (Durr√´s, Albania). Once more Caesar did not pursue the matter further. In Appian's opinion, Caesar had put off dealing with the Illyrians resolutely for fourteen years because of his Gallic Wars, his civil war and his planned war with Parthia even though he had given the command over Illyria as well as the two Gauls for ten years, and despite having wintered there. This was even regardless of the fact that at times the Illyrians plundered north-eastern Italy.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars 12-13 The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC led to a conflict between the leaders of the plot murder him, Marcus Junius Brutus, and Gaius Cassius Longinus, and the Caesarians led by the Second Triumvirate which took charge of Rome. This led to the Liberator's Civil War (43‚Äì42 BC). Before this civil war Brutus and Cassius fled to the east. They had been assigned the Roman provinces of Macedonia (Greece) and Syria respectively by Caesar. However, the Caesarians had the two provinces reassigned to Gaius Antonius (the brother of Mark Antony) and Publius Cornelius Dolabella respectively. They were Caesarians. Brutus and Cassius were given Creta et Cyrenaica instead. They were unhappy with being given this small province and prepared to invade Macedonia and Syria. However, the senate then voted to restore the two provinces to them. Brutus was also assigned Illyria. He arrived in Macedonia when Gaius Antonius had just arrived there to take up his propraetorship which had been assigned to him prior to the change made by the senate. His predecessor, Quintus Hortenius, joined Brutus. Vatinius marched on Dyrrachium and seized it before Brutus got there. However, the soldiers of his three legions (minus the lost cohorts), who disliked him, defected to Brutus, who then went on to engage Gaius Antonius who was in Apollonia (near Fier, Albania). He won over the troops of Antonius (his seven cohorts and a legion under his lieutenant, Lucius Piso) as well.Cassius Dio, Roman history, 47.21Appian, The Civil Wars, 4.57, 58, 75Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.69Cicero, Philippics, 10.13 =The campaigns of Octavian in Illyricum (35‚Äì33 BC)= Ancient historians who wrote about this period often used the terms Dalmatians and Dalmatia in a different way from their previous usage. Here these terms did not necessarily refer to the Dalmatae tribe and its territory. It was usually used as a new and wider term to indicate the region of Illyria after it was conquered by Octavian. Octavian conquered southern Pannonia (a plain north of Illyria) as well as Illyria. When the two areas became a Roman province they were given the name Illyricum. Therefore, Illyricum indicated a wider area than previously. The Romans started to use the name Dalmatia to indicate the area formerly called Illyria to distinguish it from Pannonia. Ancient historians used this terminology for the period of the campaigns of Octavian in this area in 33‚Äì35 BC as well. Caesar's Civil War, the Liberators' Civil War and the resistance against the second triumvirate which Sextus Pompey (the son of Pompey the Great) conducted from Sicily with a powerful fleet (the Sicilian Revolt, 44‚Äì36 BC) caused instability in Illyria, neighbouring north-eastern Italy and the Adriatic Sea. The Iapydes carried out raids on north-eastern Italy. There was also a problem with piracy. After these conflicts ended Octavian undertook a series of campaigns in Illyricum. Velleius Paterculus wrote that just before the Sicilian Revolt Octavian made frequent expeditions in \\"Illyricum and Dalmatia\\" in order not to keep his troops idle and to battle-harden them.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.78.2 However, it is likely that these campaigns were also linked to the instability of the region. Cassius Dio noted in passim that in 39 BC Gaius Asinius Pollio suppressed a rebellion of the Parthini after a few battles.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 48.41.7 In 35 BC Octavian campaigned against the Iapydes who had carried out raids against Aquileia, plundered Tergestus (Trieste) and had destroyed Pola (Pula) in the previous year. He marched along a steep and rugged road. The Iapydes hid in the woods and ambushed him. However, Octavian had sent contingents to occupy the ridges on both sides of the road. These descended on them and defeated them. They then abandoned the town of Terponus and fled to the thickets. Octavian seized the city, but did not burn it, hoping that they would surrender, which they did. He then advanced on Metulus (near Ogulin), which was the main town of the Iapydes. It was defended by 3,000 men who defeated the Romans who surrounded the walls. Octavian began a full siege. When its battered walls begun to crumble the Metulians built another one inside. The Romans burnt the abandoned wall and built a mound by the second one and threw four bridges on top of it. Octavian ordered some if his men to go to the back of the town to divert attention. The enemy destroyed three of the bridges. Since his soldiers panicked, Octavian crossed the bridge together with Agrippa and Hiero, two of his lieutenants, and one of his bodyguards. The soldiers followed suit. The bridge fell under their weight. Octavian was injured in the right leg and in both arms. He had more bridges built. This determination discouraged the Metulians, who surrendered. The next day they sent messengers who offered to give fifty hostages and promised to receive a garrison and to assign to the Romans the highest hills while they would occupy the lower ones. When the garrison entered and ordered them to lay down their arms they shut their wives and children in their council chamber and placed guards with orders to set fire to the building if they lost the fight they decided to undertake. They attacked from the lower positions and they were routed. The guards set fire to the council chamber. Many of the women killed themselves and their children while others jumped into the fire holding their children. The city burned completely. The rest of the Iapydes surrendered and came under Roman subjection for the first time. Octavian left and the Poseni rebelled. Marcus Helvius was sent against them. He conquered them, executed the leaders of the revolt and sold the rest into slavery.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10. 18-22 Octavian marched on the Segestani, a Pannonian tribe which had been defeated by the Romans twice but were not asked for hostages and rebelled. He advanced against them through Pannonian territory which was not under the subjection of the Romans. The enemy took to the woods and ambushed the stragglers of the army. Octavian spared the fields hoping for a voluntary surrender. Since this did not happen he ravaged the country for eight days until he reached their town, Segesta, on the River Sava. It was strongly protected by the river and a ditch. Octavian wanted to use it as a base for a campaign against the Dacians and the Bastarnae on the other side of the River Danube. Burebista had previously led them in an invasion across the Danube but then returned homeland (Dacia, in today's Romania) and campaigned to its east. Octavian must have thought that there was a danger of another invasion which would destabilise the area. Alternatively, they might have been launching raids across the river. Octavian built a fleet on the Sava to bring provisions to the Danube. When he approached the city he told the Segestani envoys that he wanted a garrison in the town and as much food as they could supply. The leaders acquiesced. The people were angry but consented to giving hostages from the notable families. When the troops came they shut the city gates and manned the walls. Augustus built a bridge over the river and besieged the town. He ambushed some Pannonians who were coming to its aid, killing some of them and putting the rest to flight. The siege lasted thirty days. Augustus only imposed a fine. He placed a garrison of twenty-five cohorts (roughly two and a half legions) and returned to Rome, intending to return in the spring.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10. 22-24 Later, as a Roman town, Segesta was called Siscia. It is now modern Sisak in Croatia. Cassius Dio wrote that after the fall of this city the rest of Pannonia surrendered. After this Octavian left Fufius Geminus there with a small force and returned to Rome. He set out to lead an expedition into Britain and had already reached Gaul in the winter of 34 BC when some of the newly conquered peoples in Pannonia and the Dalmatians rose in revolt.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 49.37.7 Appian wrote that there was a rumour that the garrison at Segesta had been massacred and Augustus made his way back. The rumour was exaggerated. There had been an uprising and the Romans had lost many men, but the next day they suppressed the rebellion. Octavian turned on the Dalmatians instead. They had been in arms since the rout of the troops of Aulus Gabinius in 48 BC. When he marched on them they formed a federation. They had up to 12,000 troops led by Versus, who had seized Promona (south of modern Knin, Croatia) from the Liburnians) and fortified it even though it was a tough mountain stronghold. Versus placed the bulk of his forces in the city and distributed the rest on the nearby hills to obstruct the Roman advance. Octavian begun to build a wall in the plain around the town and two hills held by the enemy as a cover for contingents which were heading to the highest hills through their woods. They overpowered the guards at night and at dawn Octavian attacked the city with the bulk of his army. He sent another force to reinforce the occupied heights. The enemy thought that they were attacked from all sides. Those on the hills were afraid that they would be cut off from the water supplies and fled to the town. Octavian continued to build the wall, which reached a length of seven kilometres. Testimus, another Dalmatian commander, brought a relief army. Octavian drove him back to the mountains. He seized Promona before the circumvallation was finished. A small force made a sortie. The Romans repulsed it, pursued it and entered the town with it. The enemy took refuge in the citadel. On the fourth night they attacked a Roman cohort which was keeping watch, putting it to flight. However, the attack was repulsed and the next day the city surrendered. The cohort which had fled was punished by decimation. The spared men were forced to subsist on barley instead of wheat for that summer. Testimus disbanded his troops and told them to scatter. The Romans did not pursue them.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.24-27 Cassius Dio wrote that Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa had conducted a campaign against the Dalmatians prior to this campaign.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 49.38.3 Still in 34 BC, the Romans seized the town of Sunodium at the edge of the forest in which the army of Aulus Gabinius had been entrapped by the Dalmatians in a long and deep gorge between two mountains. After Octavian had burned Sunodium the Dalmatians laid an ambush. However, he was protected by soldiers he had sent to the summits of the mountains to follow him on either side while he passed through the gorge. He cut down trees and captured and burned all the towns he found on his way. In 33 BC he besieged the city of Setovia. An enemy force came to its assistance, but he prevented it from entering the place. Octavian was struck by a stone on the knee and was confined for several days. He returned to Rome to take up his consulship and got Titus Statilius to continue the siege. He then went back to Dalmatia. The Dalmatians were cut off from foreign supplies and were hungry. They met Octavian while he was on his way and surrendered. He demanded 700 of their children as hostages, and the standards of the Roman legions which had been taken from Aulus Gabinius when he was routed. They complied and also promised to pay the tribute which had been in arrears since the time of Julius Caesar. Octavian then moved on the Derbani, who also sued for peace, gave hostages, and promised to pay the tribute in arrears. Other tribes did the same on his approach. He could not reach some tribes due to sickness. These gave no hostages and made no treaties. Appian wrote that it seemed that they were subjugated later and that Octavian subdued the whole Illyrian country, including both the tribes which had rebelled and those which had never before been under Roman rule.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.27 It is likely that Appian was referring to just Illyria/Dalmatia, rather or the whole of that was to become the province of Illyricum. With regard to Pannonia, some historians think that Octavian probably conquered the southern part of Pannonia and that the northern part was conquered in the Pannonian War (see below).Dzino, D., Bellum Pannonicum: The Roman armies and indigenous communities in southern Pannonia 16‚Äë9 BC, p. 471 Appian also wrote that Octavian overcame the Oxyaei, the Perthoneatae, the Bathiatae, the Taulantii, the Cambaei, the Cinambri, the Meromenni, and the Pyrissaei, the Docleatae, the Carui, the Interphrurini, the Naresii, the Glintidiones, the Taurisci, the Hippasini and the Bessi. The Moentini and the Avendeatae, two Iapyde tribes which lived on the Alps, surrendered on Octavian's approach. He took the city of the Arrepini, the largest and most warlike of the Iapydes, who had fled to the woods. He did not burn it hoping that they would surrender, which they did. He also seized the islands of Melite (Mljet) and Melaina Corcyra (Korƒçula) and destroyed its settlements because its inhabitants practiced piracy. He executed the young men and sold the rest into slavery. He deprived the Liburnians of their ships because they practiced piracy.Appian, The Foreign Wars, The Illyrian Wars, 10.16 Roman province After his campaigns in Illyricum, Octavian fought a war against Marc Antony and Cleopatra VII of Egypt in 31/30 BC. He won and became the sole ruler of Rome. After that he spent a few years laying the foundations for his personal rule. Illyricum became a province as a formal administrative unit in 27 BC, with the first settlement with the Roman senate. This formalised his personal rule. The senate bestowed of the honorary title of Augustus on him. He became the first Roman emperor. Historians use the name Augustus for this period. The settlement also divided the provinces of the empire into senatorial and imperial provinces. The former were under the authority of the senate, which chose their governors form among the senators. The latter were under Augustus, who appointed their governors. Augustus held the frontier provinces, which hosted the bulk of the Roman troops. Initially Illyricum was a senatorial propraetorial province. Rebellions in the province showed the necessity of maintaining a strong force there and in 11 BC it became an imperial province under the governorship of Publius Cornelius Dolabella. The administrative organisation of Illyricum was carried out late in the reign of Augustus (27 BC ‚Äì 14 AD) and early in the reign of Tiberius (14‚Äì37 AD). Tiberius made initial arrangements in the last weeks of the Batonian war (see below). This work was interrupted by a mutiny of the Roman troops in 14 AD, but was then resumed. We have a fairly detailed picture of the administrative arrangements of Illyricum through Pliny the Elder.Pliny, Natural History, 2.25-26, 28 The coastal area was subdivided into three regions called conventus juridicus which were named after the towns of Scardona (Skradin), Salona and Narona (near Metkoviƒá). The conventus Salonitanus was subdivided into 5 civitates and 927 decuriae. The conventus Naronitianus was subdivided into 13 civitates and 540 decuriae. The conventus Scardonitanus was subdivided into 14 civitates. There is no information for its decuriae. In the more urbanised coastal area towns with large Greek-speaking populations and may inhabitants from Italy were organised as municipia (self-governing towns) or coloniae (Italian settlements) and had their own council. Some of the local communities enjoyed some privileges and some Librunian ones enjoyed Italian rights. In the less urbanised interior the administration relied exclusively on the civitates. The jurisdiction of the governor of Illyricum was limited to the coastal area. The inland districts had their own governors in the form of the praefecti civitatum of the civitates. Pannonia was subdivided into 14 civitates. Again, there is no information about the decuriae. It was also a military district under the prefect of Pannonia, who was in charge of the legions stationed there.Dzino, D., Illyricum in Roman Politics, pp. 162‚Äì168 Dalmatia had considerable strategic and economic importance for the Romans. It possessed a number of important commercial ports along its coastline, and had gold-mines in DalmatiaWilkes. J., The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe), p. 224: \\"... governor of Dalmatia forced the natives to wash out the gold, though they were too ignorant to appreciate its value, and there was an imperial bureau for the Dalmatian gold mines based in Salona.\\" with an imperial bureau in Salona. Dyrrachium (Durr√´s, in modern Albania) and Brundisium (Brindisi, in southern Italy) were the ports used to cross the Adriatic Sea for the journeys from Rome to the eastern Mediterranean and vice versa. Dyrrachium also became the starting point of the Via Egnatia, the Roman road which went to Byzantium in the east, opposite Asia. There were important Roman communities in a number of towns on the central and southern part of the coast of today's Croatia, such as Iader (Zadar), Salona (Solin, on the outskirts of Split), Narona (near Metkoviƒá), and Epidaurus (Epidaurum in Latin, modern Cavtat, near Dubrovnik).Chapot, V.; Parker, E. A, The Romans, World History of civilization (1997), p. 268 The capital Salona was protected by two military camps at Burnum and Delminium. =The Pannonian War (14‚Äì10 BC)= From 14 BC to 10 BC there was a series of rebellions in southern Pannonia and northern Dalmatia which Roman writers referred to as bellum pannomicum (the Pannonian war). We have very little information about these events. Most of it comes from brief accounts by Cassius Dio and passing references by other authors. We are not told what the causes were either. The Roman sources had little interest in Illyria from the campaigns of Augustus in 35‚Äì33 BC to 16 BC. Cassius Dio wrote that in that year the governor of Illyria for 17‚Äì16 BC, Publius Silius Nerva, went to fight in the Italian Alps because there were no troops there. Taking advantage of this, some Pannonians and the Noricans entered Istria and pillaged it. Silius Nerva quickly brought the situation under control. At the same time, there was a small rebellion in Dalmatia. The Dentheletae (a Thracian tribe in eastern Moesia), together with the Scordisci (who lived in today's Serbia, at the confluence of the Rivers Savus [Sava], Dravus [Drava] and Danube) attacked the Roman province of Macedonia (Greece). At the same time a civil war broke out in Thrace. Therefore, there was instability on the eastern Alps and in the Balkan Peninsula. In 15 BC the Romans conquered the Scordisci and annexed Noricum. They also conducted other operations further west on the Alps against the Rhaeti and Vindelici.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.20.1‚Äë3 The Roman military operations in Illyricum might have been started by Marcus Vinicius the governor for 14‚Äì13 BC. The Pannonian war led to Illyricum being transferred from being a senatorial province to being an imperial province. Velleius Paterculus wrote that the Pannonian war started by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Vinicius and that Tiberius ended it.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.96.2‚Äë3 Florus mentioned a victory of Vinicius over the Pannonians living between the rivers Sava and Drava.Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 2.24 Cassius Dio noted in two separate passages that a rebellion by the Pannonians in 14 BC was suppressed quickly, and that in late 13 BC Augustus gave Agrippa, his most important ally, supreme command and sent him to Pannonia (this suggests that the problem was serious). Agrippa solved the situation through negotiations and personal influence.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.24.3, 28.1-2 After Agrippa's sudden death the Breuci refused to observe the treaty they had made with him. Tiberius was given the command in Pannonia and defeated the Pannonians with the help of the Scordisci, who had been recently conquered by the Romans.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.31.2-3 Suetonius added that after this Tiberius subjugated the Dalmatians and the Breuci.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Tiberius, 9.2 In 11 BC Tiberius fought and defeated both the Dalmatians and the Pannonians. Later in the year, as already mentioned, Illyricum became an imperial province under the control of Augustus. In the winter 11/10 BC the Dacians crossed the frozen Danube and plundered the Pannonians. Some Dalmatian communities rebelled against the payment of a tribute. Tiberius, who was in Gaul, had to return to confront this. In 10 BC there were repeated uprisings in both Pannonia and Dalmatia which Tiberius suppressed.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 54.36.2 3, 55.2.4 Cassius Dio referred to all of these conflicts as rebellions. Dzino argues that it is therefore unlikely that they involved any conquests. The relations of the Romans with locals in frontier areas involved alliance treaties and treaties with client states, both of which entailed nominal independence. The breaking of these treaties was considered as a rebellion and as something which had to be suppressed. Augustus in his propagandistic writing stated that under Tiberius‚Äô command Rome extended her sphere to Pannonian peoples where the Roman army had never been before and that Augustus extended the boundaries of Illyricum to the banks of the River Danube. However, Suetonius implied that this extension to the banks of this river occurred only after the Batonian War (see below).Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Tiberius, 16 It is likely that in the aftermath of the Pannonian war Roman military presence in southern Pannonia increased. Dzino argues that it is likely that the local communities acted as a compact anti-Roman block and that there may have been pro- and anti-Roman factions. Some may have surrendered peacefully and some of them may have been pro-Roman all along. The communities of the region relied on kinship relationships, rather than formal state institutions. This may have led to political competition. Being friendly to the Romans or challenging them could have involved manoeuvres by local elites to strengthen their power-base. Acquiescence or opposition to the Romans could involve often unpredictable contests over political positions locally.Dzino, D., \\"Bellum Pannonicum: The Roman armies and indigenous communities in southern Pannonia 16‚Äë9 BC\\", pp. 471‚Äì472 =Batonian War (6‚Äì9 AD)= The Batonian War (bellum batonianum in Latin) was a large scale rebellion which was led by Bato the Daesitiate and Bato the Breucian. The Romans named this war after these two leaders with the same name. It lasted four years (6‚Äì9 AD). In 6 AD the Romans were preparing to launch a second expedition against the Marcomanni in Germania. This would have involved the legions stationed in Germania and most of the legions stationed in Illyricum. The natives were asked to provide auxiliary troops. When these forces gathered they rebelled under the leadership of Bato the Daesitiate. Cassius Dio described his force as Dalmatian, which suggests that he had men who came from various tribes of Dalmatia. This is a very likely scenario as the native troops would have been recruited from a wide area. A Roman force which was sent against the rebels was defeated. Bato the Breucian, the military leader of the Breuci, the largest tribe in southern Pannonia, marched on Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, in today's Serbia). He was defeated by Aulus Caecina Severus, the governor of the neighbouring Roman province of Moesia. Bato the Daesitiate marched on Salona, in Dalmatia, but was defeated by Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus, the governor of Illyricum. Bato then went east to join the other Bato and the two of them occupied Mount Alma (Mount Fru≈°ka Gora, Serbia, just north of Sirmium). They were defeated by a Thracian cavalry detachment of Rhoemetalces (the king of the Odrysian Kingdom in Thrace) which supported the Romans. The Dalmatians overran the territory of the Roman allies and drew many more tribes into the revolt. Tiberius (the future emperor), who was in charge of the Roman army marched on them. However, they avoided pitched battles and kept moving around, causing great devastation. Facing an enemy with avoided bitched battle and used guerrilla tactics, Tiberius conducted counterinsurgency operations.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.110, 112.1-2 According to Velleius Paterculus the rebels divided their forces into three parts. One was to invade Italy, which was not far from Nauportus (a Roman fort in today's Slovenia), one had already entered the Roman Province of Macedonia (Greece) and the third fought in their home territories. They executed their plan swiftly. They massacred Roman civilians and a sizable veteran contingent who were helpless in this remote area. They seized Macedonia and the pillaged everywhere. Thus, in this version the rebellion seemed to have a plan and the Dalmatians and the Breuci seemed to have acted in concert from the beginning. In Cassius Dio, instead, Bato the Daesitiate initially had a few men and his success increased his forces. After his failure to take Salona he allied with the other Bato. Tiberius divided the Roman army into several divisions to evade the united forces of the rebels. Outposts were placed to blockade them, to prevent them from breaking through and to disrupt their supplies. The situation in Illyricum, which was next to Italy, created panic in Rome and even Augustus was fearful. Levies were held all over Italy. The veterans were recalled. Rich families were ordered to supply freedmen compulsorily in proportion to their income. Augustus warned that the rebels could reach Rome in ten days if drastic action was not taken.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29-30 In 7 AD Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum with a force of freemen and freedmen. Some of the latter were requisitioned form their masters, who were paid a compensation. Velleius Paterculus wrote that the rebels in Pannonia who faced Tiberius were not happy with the size of their forces. They were worn down and brought to the verge of famine (presumably due to ravaging), could not withstand his offensives an avoided pitched battles. They went to the Claudian Mountains (a mountain range in Pannonia, in the Vara≈ædin County in northern Croatia) and took a defensive position in their fortifications. The second rebel force confronted the legions which Caecina Severus and Marcus Plautius Silvanus were bringing to Illyricum (from Moesia and the Roman province of Asia, three and two legions respectively). They surrounded the five legions, their auxiliary troops and the Thracian cavalry and almost inflicted a fatal defeat. The Thracian cavalry was routed and the allied cavalry fled. The legions suffered casualties, but they then rallied and won the day. In Cassius Dio‚Äô version, instead, the two Batos went to wait for the arrival of Caecina Severus. He did not mention Plautius Silvanus. They attacked him unexpectedly when he was encamped near the Volcaean marshes. They were defeated. After this battle the Roman army was divided into detachments to overrun many parts of the country at once. The rebels withdrew to mountain fortresses from which they launched raids whenever they could. Aulus Caecina Severus and Marcus Plautius Silvanus joined Tiberius and a huge army was assembled. As mentioned, they had five legions. Tiberius also had five legions (three in Pannonia and two in Dalmatia). Tiberius decided to send the newly arrived armies back because the army was too large to be manageable. He escorted them with his troops. He then returned to Siscia at the beginning of a very hard winter.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.29.6, 31.2, 32.3Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History 2.112.3-6, 113 In 8 AD the Dalmatians and the Pannonians wanted to sue for peace due to famine and disease, but they were prevented from doing so by the rebels, who had no hope of being spared by the Romans and continued to resist. Tiberius had pursued a policy of scorched earth to starve the Pannonians. According to Cassius Dio, Bato the Breucian overthrew Pinnes, the king of the Breuci. He became suspicious of his subject tribes and demanded hostages from the Pannonian garrisons. Bato the Daesitiate defeated him in battle and pinned him in a stronghold. He was handed over to Bato the Daesitiate and he was executed. After this many Pannonians rose in revolt. Marcus Plautius Silvanus conducted a campaign against them, conquered the Breuci and won over other tribes without a battle. Bato the Daesitiate withdrew from Pannonia, occupied the passes leading to Dalmatia and ravaged Dalmatia. In Pannonia there was some brigandage.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.34.4-7 Velleius Paterculus, wrote that the harsh winter brought rewards because in the following summer all of Pannonia sought peace. The Pannonians laid down their arms at the River Bathinus. Bato was made a prisoner and Pinnes gave himself up.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.114.4Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.34.4-7 In 9 AD the war was restricted to Dalmatia. Velleius Paterculus wrote that Augustus gave the chief command of all the forces to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. In the summer Lepidus made his way to Tiberius through areas which had not been affected by the war. He was attacked by the locals who had not been weakened by fighting. Lepidus defeated them, ravaged the fields, and burnt houses. He succeeded in reaching Tiberius. This campaign ended the war. Two Dalmatian tribes, the Perustae and Daesitiate, who were almost unconquerable because of their mountain strongholds, the narrow passes in which they lived and their fighting spirit, were almost exterminated. Cassius Dio wrote Germanicus conducted some operations in Dalmatia and seized several towns. Tiberius then split the army into three divisions. He sent two of them to subdue areas of Dalmatia and he went in search of Bato the Daesitiate third one. Tiberius chased the fugitive Bato around the country. He finally besieged him at Adetrium, near Salona. This was on a rock and was surrounded by steep ravines. After a long siege he managed to storm the place. Bato promised to surrender if he and his followers would be pardoned. Tiberius agreed. According to Cassius Dio Tiberius asked Bato why his people had rebelled. He replied: \\"You Romans are to blame for this; for you send as guardians of your flocks, not dogs or shepherds, but wolves.\\" It is uncertain if this quote can be attributed to Bato, however, due to the habit of ancient writers of creating fictitious quotes and attributing them to historical figures.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 56.11-16Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.114.5, 115-1-4Cassius Dio, Roman History, 55.34.4-7; 56.11-16 =Regions of the province and its later dissolution= The earliest writing which indicates that the province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and Pannonia is when Velleius Paterculus mentions Gaius Vibius Postumus was the military commander of Dalmatia in AD 9, towards the end of the Batonian War.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, 2.116.3 It seems that officially the province of Illyricum comprised Upper (Superius) and Lower (Inferius) Illyricum. A transcript of an inscription of a monument honouring Publius Cornelius Dolabella at Epidaurum (Cavtat, near Dubrovnik) attests that Dolabella was appointed governor of Illyricum shortly before Augustus‚Äô death and that the statue was erected by the towns of Upper Illyricum, which implies the existence of an Upper and Lower Illyricum. = ILS 938 However, no inscriptions attesting a Lower Illyricum have been found as yet. Dalmatia was called Upper Illyricum. Whilst the names Dalmatia and Pannonia were used in common parlance, it seems that Upper Illyricum (Dalmatia) and Lower Illyricum (Pannonia) were the official names of the two regions. The provincial governor resided in Salona in Dalmatia and governed Upper Illyricum. Lower Illyricum was a military district and a military commander was in charge of this area and its three legions and performed administrative functions as something like a deputy governor.≈†a≈°el-Kos, \\"Pannonia or Lower Illyricum?\\" Tyche, Band 25 (2010), pp. 123‚Äì130 Writing in the winter of AD 57‚Äì58,Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an Abbreviated Bible Commentary, 23rd edition, Zondervan Publishing House (1962) the Apostle Paul refers to Illyricum in his Letter to the Romans as the westernmost point of his missionary travels so far. The letter reflects his intention in due course to travel to Rome. The province of Illyricum was eventually dissolved and replaced by two smaller provinces: Dalmatia (the southern area) and Pannonia (the northern and Danubian area). It is unclear when this happened. Kov√°c noted that an inscription on the base of a statue of Nero erected between 54 and 68 AD attests that it was erected by the veteran of a legion stationed in Pannonia and argues that this is the first epigraphic evidence that a separate Pannonia existed at least since the reign of Nero.Kov√°c, P., \\"A Pisidian Veteran and the Forst Mention of Pannonis\\", Tyche, 22 (2007), pp. 99‚Äì107. PL1Kov√°cs, P., \\"Some Notes on the division of Illyiricum\\", in Piso, I., (ed.), Die Romischen Provinzen. Bergriff und Gundung (2008), pp. 237‚Äì248 However, ≈†a≈°el-Kos notes that an inscription attests a governor of Illyricum under the reign of Claudius (43‚Äì51 AD) and in a military diploma published in the late 1990s, dated July 61 AD, units of auxiliaries from the Pannonian part of the province were mentioned as being stationed in Illyricum.Dusanic, S., \\"An Early Diploma Milirare\\", Starinar (1998), p. 51‚Äì62 = Some other diplomas from the reign of Nero attest the same.Holder R., P Roman Military Diplomas IV (2003), no. 202 Therefore, ≈†a≈°el-Kos supports the notion that the province was dissolved during the reign of Vespasian (79‚Äì89 AD) The Roman province of Illyricum comprised Dalmatia and Pannonia. Diocletian's reforms: the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum In 293 AD the emperor Diocletian radically reformed the administrative structure of the Roman empire. He created the tetrarchy (rule by four). This was a co- emperorship with two senior emperors (Augusti), Diocletian and Maximian, and two junior emperors (Caesars), Constantius Chlorus and Galerius. The empire was subdivided into four praetorian prefectures. Each was headed by one of two co-emperors or one of two Caesars (thus, a total of two co-emperors and two Caesars). Diocletian and Maximian were also in overall charge of the eastern and the western part of the empire respectively. The number of provinces was doubled and they were grouped into fifteen dioceses which were under the praetorian prefectures. The praetorian prefectures were Galliae, Italia et Africa, Oriens and Illyricum. Thus, Illyricum became a praetorian prefecture. It included the dioceses of Pannonia, (western Hungary, a strip of land in northern Croatia along the River Sava, and Vojvodina, in northern Serbia), Dacia (modern western, central and northern Bulgaria, central and southern Serbia, Montenegro, northern Albania and the north part of North Macedonia) and Macedonia (Greece). Hence, Illyricum came to cover the whole of the Balkan Peninsula, including Greece, except for the diocese of Thrace (in modern south-eastern Bulgaria, north-eastern Greece and European Turkey). It also included Crete and the Greek islands in the north and the southwest of the Aegean Sea, and Noricum. The diocese of Pannonia was subdivided into the provinces of Pannonia Prima, Secunda, Savia and Veleria (the north, southeast, southwest and west of Pannonia respectively), Dalmatia, Noricum Ripense (\\"along the river\\", the northern part, which was crossed by the river Danube) and Noricum Mediterraneum (the southern part).Talbert, R., Atlas of Classical History (1989), p. 175 The capital of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum was Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica, northern Serbia). Under the tetrarchy it was headed by Galerius. The praetorian prefecture survived until the early 7th century. Military importance Pannonia was a very valuable source of military manpower for the entire empire. From the 3rd to the 6th century some of the most useful troops were recruited from Pannonia, Dalmatia, Moesia and Roman Thrace. The Roman General Stilicho attempted to bring the region under Western Roman control for this reason. Pannonia and the other areas along the River Danube, the frontier of the empire in the Balkan Peninsula, were exposed to attacks on the empire from across this river. Therefore, Pannonia was very important militarily. Pat Southern sees Illyricum as holding the empire together.Southern, P., Augustus (Roman Imperial Biographies), (1998), p. 245 In the Late Roman Empire, the armies of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum had a commander in-chief, the magister militum per Illyricum, based at Naissus (Ni≈°, southern Serbia).Croke, B., Count Marcellinus and his chronicle (2001), p. 54 John Bury wrote that \\"The importance of Illyricum did not lie in its revenues, but in its men.\\"Bury, J., The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians (2000), p. 69. The region's native peoples, renowned for their military prowess, became important for the Roman army. During the Crisis of the Third Century the emperors Claudius II (reigned 268‚Äì270), Quintilius (reigned 270), Aurelian (reigned 270‚Äì275) and Probus (reigned 276‚Äì282) were born in Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, in today's Serbia). They have been dubbed by historians the Pannonian emperors. Diocletian (reigned 284‚Äì305) was born in Salona (Solin, Croatia). Constantine the Great and Constantius III (421AD ) were born in Naissus (Ni≈°, Serbia). His father, Constantius Chlorus, was born in Moesia Superior. The Byzantine emperor Anastasius I (reigned 491‚Äì518) was born in Dyrrhachium (Durr√´s, Albania). Justinian I (reigned 527‚Äì565) was born in Tauresium, in the province of Dardania in the Diocese of Dacia (20 kilometres [12 miles] southeast of Skopje in today's North Macedonia).Bury, J. B., History of the Later Roman Empire from Arcadius to Irene, Vol 2 (2008), p. 7; Justinian I was the last Latin emperor of this empire. From then on all the emperors were Greek.

Perhaps it means 'life history' or 'legend'. In PƒÅli it has the additional, older meaning of advice or moral instruction.

The ApadƒÅna consists of about 600 poems (between 589Von Hin√ºber, Handbook of Pali Literature, New Delhi 1996: 61. and 603 in different editions), mostly biographical stories of senior Buddhist monks and nuns, but also of Buddhas and solitary Buddhas. Many of the stories of monks and nuns are expansions of, or otherwise related to, verses presented in the Theragatha and Therigatha as having been spoken by senior members of the early Sangha. The ApadƒÅna is a parallel to the JƒÅtaka commentary, in which the Buddha recounts his previous lives.Oskar von Hin√ºber, Handbook of Pali Literature, New Delhi 1996: 61. Most ApadƒÅna stories follow a fairly predictable outline, in which the speaker recounts their meritorious deeds in previous births as ethical individuals in a variety of different circumstances in different parts of India, before finally recounting the story of their present birth and how they came to be disciples of the Buddha. These stories of the previous lives of famous and not so famous monks and nuns may have been meant to provide moral examples to lay followers who wished to live as Buddhists but were unable or unwilling to undertake ordination as bhikkhus or bhikkhunis.

It belongs to the oldest building phase of the city of Persepolis, in the first half of the 6th century BC, as part of the original design by Darius the Great. Its construction was completed by Xerxes I. Modern scholarship \\"demonstrates the metaphorical nature of the Apadana reliefs as idealised social orders\\".M. Root (1986) p. 1. Etymology As a word, apadƒÅna (Old Persianêé†êé±êé≠êé†êé¥, masc.) is used to designate a hypostyle hall, i.e., a palace or audience hall of stone construction with columns. The word is rendered in Elamite as ha-ha-da-na and in Babylonian ap-pa-da-an is etymologically ambiguous. It has been compared to the Sanskrit \\"apadana\\" (‡§Ü‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§®) which means 'to arrive at', and also to the Sanskrit apa-dhƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§™‡§ß‡§æ) which means \\"a hide-out or concealment\\", and the Greek Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑ - apo-thƒìkƒì meaning \\"storehouse\\". The word survived into later periods in Iran, as the Parthian 'pdn(y) or 'pdnk(y) \\"palace\\", and outside Iran it still survives in several languages as loan-words (including the Arabic fadan ŸÅŸéÿØŸéŸÜ for \\"palace\\" and the Armenian aparan-k ø for \\"palace\\".)R. Schmitt, Apadana i. Term, in Encyclopaedia Iranica More precisely, however, this word is the direct ancestor of the medieval and modern architectural term, ayvan/aywan. The Old Persian term êé†êé±êé≠êé†êé¥, a-pad-an, standing for \\"unprotected\\", refers to the fact that the veranda-shaped structure is open to the outside elements on one of its four sides, and thus 'unprotected' / exposed to the natural elements. This is exactly what the Apadana palace has: open (columned) verandas on three sides‚Äîa unique feature among all palace buildings at Persepolis. The Parthian and Sasanian architects largely did away with the columns holding up the ceiling of the veranda, replacing them with a barrel vaulting, such as the famous Ayvan of Kisra at Ctesiphon. The later evolution of term into aywan in the post-Islamic architecture that evolved from the old \\"apadana\\", refers to both columned (such as the palace of Chehel Sotoun, Isfahan) or barrel vaulted (all the four-aywaned mosques). Like the old Apadana, the new aywans are also verandas: open to the natural elements on one side. As a modern architectural and archaeological term, the word \\"apadana\\" is also used to refer to Urartian hypostyle halls, such as those excavated at Altintepe and Erebuni. These halls predate those from Persia, and it has been proposed that Urartu could be the stylistic origin of the later Persian hypostyle audience halls.Henri Stierlin, \\"Greece, from Mycenae to the Parthenon (Taschen's World Architecture)\\", 1997. p116. Description Apadana Palace (East Side) Persepolis The Apadana was the largest building on the Terrace at Persepolis and was excavated by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld and his assistant Friedrich Krefter, and Erich Schmidt, between 1931 and 1939. Important material relevant to the excavations are today housed in the archives of the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. It was most likely the main hall of the kings. The columns reached 20m high and had complex capitals in the shape of bulls or lions. Here, the great king received the tribute from all the nations in the Achaemenid Empire, and gave presents in return. Access to the hall is given by two monumental stairways, on the north and on the east. These are decorated by reliefs, showing delegates of the 23 subject nations of the Persian Empire paying tribute to Darius I, who is represented seated centrally. The various delegates are shown in great detail, giving insight into the costume and equipment of the various peoples of Persia in the 5th century BC. There are inscriptions in Old Persian and Elamite. Measurements The Apadana at Persepolis has a surface of 1000 square metres; its roof was supported by 72 columns, each 24 metres tall. The entire hall was destroyed in 331 BC by the army of Alexander the Great. Stones from the columns were used as building material for nearby settlements. By the start of the 20th century, only 13 of these giant columns were still standing. The re-erecting of a complete, but fallen column in the 1970s, is now the 14th standing column of the Apadana. The Apadana in Susa was‚Äîlike the city itself‚Äîlargely abandoned, and pillaged for building material. Legacy The apadana hall influenced the Umayyad architecture. Early mosques built in Persia and Iraq imitate this structure.

Some scholars speak about Austrian literature in a strict sense from the year 1806 on when Francis II disbanded the Holy Roman Empire and established the Austrian Empire. A more liberal definition incorporates all the literary works written on the territory of today's and historical Austria, especially when it comes to authors who wrote in German. Thus, the seven volume history of Austrian literature by the editors Herbert Zeman and Fritz Peter Knapp is titled Geschichte der Literatur in √ñsterreich (\\"History of Literature in Austria\\"). The Austrian literature must be considered in close connection with German literature in general, and the borderline between proper German literature and the Austrian one is porous, due to rich and complex cultural exchanges. Origin and background Franz Kafka There are and have been many tries to work out a complete definition of Austrian literature. Something most people can agree on is that there are certain differences and distinctive motives common in this literature which make it stand apart from other literary traditions. From the 19th century onward, Austria contributed some of the greatest names in modern literature. It was the home of novelists / short- story writers Adalbert Stifter, Arthur Schnitzler, Franz Werfel, Stefan Zweig, Franz Kafka, Thomas Bernhard, Joseph Roth, or Robert Musil, of poets Georg Trakl, Rose Ausl√§nder, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke or Paul Celan. Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are Elfriede Jelinek and Peter Handke, well-known essayists are Robert Menasse and Karl-Markus Gau√ü. Yet, it is hard to speak of an Austrian literature prior to that period. In the early 18th century, Lady Mary Wortly Montague, whilst visiting Vienna, was stunned to meet no writers at all. For all of Austria's contributions to architecture, and having one of the most hallowed musical traditions in Europe, no Austrian literature made it to the classical canon until the 19th century. A number of reasons can be given. Firstly, the arts were the preserve of the imperial court, who saw culture as a political tool, as propaganda. Fine baroque palaces, imperial portraits and commissions of music could all work very well to this aim, but literature was deemed less suitable, and thus not encouraged. Secondly was the late emergence of a German literature; whilst much was published in the German language, little had the calibre to become 'classic' until the late 18th century, when Goethe and Schiller began writing. In Austria, the imperial state also censored all books mercilessly; The Sorrows of Young Werther, Goethe's novel depicting a young man's ecstatic love and suicide, spawned a string of copycat suicides across Germany, and many states banned the work, but Austrian authorities also banned Goethe's entire opus. It came mostly from Empress Maria Theresa's 'Chastity Commission', intended to uphold public morals, but it had the effect not only of creating a facade of decency, but a stunted intellectual front. But perhaps the greatest reason for Austria's late literary fruition was its cultural mindset. According to the cultural historian Carl Emil Schorske, 'profoundly Catholic, it was a deeply sensuous, plastic culture'. The outlook of a leisured aristocracy, it was copied by the lower classes. This mentality was not necessarily bad; the emphasis on beauty and fantasy was integral to establishing the imperial capital of Vienna, and it made Vienna the greatest centre of music in Europe. But it was not the best ground for literary experiment. Nevertheless, the liberalisation of Austria in the late 19th century created a more dynamic climate for writing, which soon produced a flowering. This article tries to provide some definitions which together may give a better understanding of authors and literature in Austria and its territorial predecessors, referring to all published works as well as those with classic status. The search for a definition The main problem of defining a dynamic development may be that any definition will fall short of the various currents which lead to a certain type of literature. Through the centuries, there have been many different approaches, but most of them have been criticised to be biased - cultural, ideological or political. The Austrian literature developed out of a symbiosis of different regional traditions and languages. In the Middle Ages, there was a homogeneous zone along the Danube river, spanning from Bavaria down to the eastern territories. Travellers and bards moved along this route, bringing with them new influences. At the same time Alps had their forbidding little valleys, which were virtually untouched - they developed their own regional culture. This is important, because it remains characteristic through the centuries. On the one hand, there were writers strictly in the tradition of a region (like towns, countries etc.), language or culture, on the other hand there was a continuous influence on each other's writing and thinking. The multi-ethnic Habsburg Monarchy, Austrian Empire and eventually Austro- Hungarian Empire should therefore not be reduced to the German parts of the empire. There were large ethnic or religious minorities in nearly all regional capitals, like Prague, Budapest or Vienna‚Äîmicrocosmi with their own traditions and characteristics. Franz Kafka may be a good example: while in some of his writings he was declaring himself to be \\"German\\" this was meant more in relation to the ethnic minority living in Prague than as a declaration for another part of the empire. So perhaps he was a \\"German-speaking-secular- Jewish-Prague-born-Austro-Hungarian-Austro-Czech writer\\" - a term which best shows the difficulties that are to be faced. Besides the national differences between the provinces, there were also different regions which influenced the writing style. There were Alps with their distinctive traditions, the deep woods, the coastal regions around Trieste (now Italy and Slovenia) and the Croatian islands, which served as the Austro-Hungarian equivalent to the French C√¥te d'Azur, a centre for writers, painters and other artists at value - and that often meant religious texts - were written down. In addition most texts were also translated into Latin before they were put down (e.g. Germanic tribal laws). Different sources however suggest that there also existed aristocratic historical records (like Heldenlieder), lyric folklore (dance, love songs, spells). Only by accident individual texts were preserved in monasteries. Examples for this are the \\"Merseburger Zauberspr√ºche\\", two Germanic spells being the only written proofs for pagan religion in the German-speaking lands. The \\"Hildebrandslied\\" is important as voucher of Germanic hero literature. The first German texts were written to translate Latin religious books around 750 in the early Middle Ages. The Benedictine communities in Melk and Salzburg were carrying on notable literary and religious activities. Ava (1060‚Äì1127), who was the first known female writing in German, wrote in this religiously inspired tradition and lived in the territories which were then and now within borders of Austria. Heinrich von dem Tuerl√Æn: Diu Cr√¥ne. Heidelberg, UB, cpg 374, 1r. =High and Late Middle Ages (1170‚Äì1500)= With the crusades around 1160, the knights became more important and prosperous. The oral minnesang was a new form, dealing with their love. The topics of the ballads were also more worldly with themes ranging from love and war to political criticism. There was a lot of travelling along the Danube river, with travelling bards (Minnes√§nger) bringing news and new songs. The towns were getting rich and independent. The first representatives of this movement and first known male writers in German were Der von K√ºrenberg and Dietmar von Aist (12th century). At the end of the 12th century, one of the most important literary works of the times, Nibelungenlied, emerged. It was created by an unknown minnesang poet most probably in the territories of Austria. As the tradition of minnesang grew, the older poets started teaching younger ones. For example, probably the most known German bard Walther von der Vogelweide (13th century) learnt his craft from Reinmar von Hagenau at the court in Vienna. Among other known minnesang poets are Neidhart, Jans der Enikel, Ulrich von Liechtenstein, and Oswald von Wolkenstein. In the 12th century, satire was also developing. Seifried Helbling was an example of a writer who wrote texts of this type. Later on the minnesang, that was cultivated by knights, became a craft practiced by burghers - meistersingers. Its centre was more to the west, in Nuremberg. Michael Beheim was a meistersinger poet strongly connected with the court in Vienna. Yet another form that developed at that time was drama. Especially, presentations of Passion were regularly played. Das Wiener Passionsspiel is worth mentioning here. An Austrian representative of the Holy Grail literature is Heinrich von dem Tuerl√Æn (also written T√ºrlin). He wrote the poem Diu Cr√¥ne, which has about 30,000 lines. The edition of the original text in Middle High German has completed recently by the Viennese Germanists Fritz Peter Knapp, Manuela Niesner (Part I, Altdeutsche Textbibliothek, T√ºbingen 2000), Alfred Ebenbauer and Florian Kragl (Part II, Altdeutsche Textbibliothek, T√ºbingen 2005), who are preparing a translation to Modern German. =Renaissance= Around 1600, the humanism, with his rediscovery of the ancient cultures and ideals spread from Italy throughout Europe. Emperor Maximilian I was a big supporter of this movement. He managed to gather around his court in Vienna humanists such as Conrad Celtes - the founder of Collegium Poetarum or in the later time poet laureat Vadian (Joachim von Watt) who wrote in Latin. Eleonore of Austria translated to German a widely read French adventure novel Pontus et la belle Sidonie. Big figures of the Catholic Church of that time Nicholas of Cusa and Petrus Canisius were connected with Austrian court and a few of their works wrote in German. =Baroque= The Thirty Years War had multiple effects on European literary trends; some writers based their work on the sufferings of the time, or withdrew into writings of a religious nature. Others responded with escapism, providing beautiful and peaceful worlds readers could flee to. The humorous stories (Schelmenromane) brought relief to the suffering people. This trend is apparent with Abraham a Sancta Clara's religious and comical works. and Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg's religious poetry. As a reaction to the Protestant movements of the Reformation, which rocked the Catholic-led Habsburg territories, many Catholic schools emerged on the territories of Austria. These colleges led by the Jesuit order developed plays and operas that were Italian in style and impressed most by their luxurious equipment. Sermons were an important genre of baroque literature, rooted as it was in the Counter-Reformation. The mentioned above Benedictine monk Abraham a Sancta Clara was a notable preacher of the times. A Jesuit, Georg Scherer, is another example of a monk the sermons of whom were published and had a wider audience. Another literary form were improvised plays called \\"Hanswurstspiele\\". This direction was represented by Josef Anton Stranitzky, Gottfried Prehauser, Joachim Perinet and Josef Felix von Kurz-Bernardon. Examples of baroque epic are the chivalric fiction and \\"Schelmenromane\\" of Johann Beer, which represent a realistic description of the reality at that time. =Enlightenment= With the start of Enlightenment around 1720, philosophy and the need of literature to educate the reader (Lehrdichtung, Bildungsroman) were two new and strong motivations for literature. Aristotle and his school of thinking was revived. These ideas developed on the territories of Austria during the rule of Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II. Around 1790 the ideas of Enlightenment were firmly rooted and the ancient classic cultures (Greek and Roman) were the inspiration for poets, artists, architects and writers. Harmony and Beauty were some of the ideals of that time. The Austrian literature also was under the strong influence of Freemasonry and strongly connected with the criticism towards clergy. All these circumstances caused that the literature started to be more educative and instructional. The satire started to be one of the most frequently used literary genres. The literary life of Enlightenment concentrated around an almanac Wienerischer Musen-Almanach. It was started in 1777 (from 1786 under a changed title Wiener Musen-Almanach) by Joseph Franz von Ratschky and Gottlieb von Leon. Aloys Blumauer was also its editor since 1781 (he even edited a few editions alone). A notable place in the Austrian literature of this period has Johann Baptist von Alxinger who wrote chivalric epics Doolin von Maynz (1787) and Bliomberis (1791) which were inspired by the tradition of Freemasonry. Alxinger also wrote poetry based on anticlerical ideas. The writings of a might-have-been monk Johann Pezzl also had a profile of this kind. He wrote journalistic and epic texts. Classical vision of poetry promoted by Joseph Schreyvogel strongly influenced later authors (for instance Franz Grillparzer). Schreyvogel improved considerably the quality of the Austrian theatre. He was a dramatic adviser at the Wiener Burgtheater from 1814‚Äì32. Another important dramatist was Johann Nepomuk von Kalchberg, but historical themes of his dramas give his work the flavour of Romanticism. =First half of 19th century= Around 1790 these ideas were firmly rooted and the ancient classic cultures (Greek and Roman) were the inspiration for poets, artists, architects and writers. Harmony and Beauty were some of the ideals of that time. There was a lot of philosophical and aesthetic writing which accumulated in the Romantic era around 1820 (mostly writers from the nobility). With the Napoleonic Wars going on, a lot of people wanted literature which took them away in a fantasy world. A lot of religious writing was also providing people with new hope. Klemens Maria Hofbauer, Eduard von Bauernfeld and Franz Grillparzer are but three of the writers influenced by these events. The German writer Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel also lived and worked in Vienna around 1809. Between the years 1815, the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and 1848, the year of the European revolutions the Biedermeier contrasted with the Romantic era which preceded it partly. Biedermeier can be identified with two trends in early 19th-century history. The first trend is growing urbanisation and industrialisation leading to a new urban middle class. The early Lieder of Schubert, which were performable at the piano without substantial musical training, serve as examples. Further, Biedermeier writers were mainly middle-class, as opposed to the German Romantics, who were mainly drawn from the nobility. The second trend is the growing political oppression following the end of the Napoleonic Wars prompting people to concentrate on the domestic and the non-political. =Biedermeier= Biedermeier refers to work in the fields of literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the years 1815 (Vienna Congress), the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and 1848, the year of the European revolutions and contrasts with the Romantic era which preceded it. Biedermeier can be identified with two trends in early 19th-century German history. The first trend is growing urbanization and industrialization leading to a new urban middle class. The early Lieder of Schubert, which were performable at the piano without substantial musical training, serve as examples. Further, Biedermeier writers were mainly middle-class, as opposed to the Romantics, who were mainly drawn from the nobility. The second trend is the growing political oppression following the end of the Napoleonic Wars prompting people to concentrate on the domestic and (at least in public) the non-political. The strict publication rules and the censorship had the consequence, that the main topics written about were unpolitical, e.g. Historical Fiction or Books about the quiet life in the countryside. This does not mean that there was not a lot of political discussion going on, but it happened at home and in the presence of close friends. This explosive situation finally led to the revolutions in Europe in the year 1848. Poets of that time in Austria were Nikolaus Lenau (1802‚Äì1850) and Franz Grillparzer. The latter is often mentioned as a representative of Austrian Classicism in literature. Playwrights at that time were Franz Grillparzer (1791‚Äì1872), Friedrich Halm (1806‚Äì1871) - also an accomplished writer of \\"Novellen\\" (novellas and short stories) -, Johann Nepomuk Nestroy (1801‚Äì1862) and Ferdinand Raimund (1790‚Äì1836). Grillparzer wrote tragedies in the tradition of the \\"Weimarer Klassik\\", Nestroy and Raimund were representatives for the \\"Wiener Volksst√ºck\\" mainly played at the Viennese theater \\"Volkstheater Wien\\". Charles Sealsfield - a pseudonym of Karl Postl - lived a long time in the US and wrote novels set in the Wild West. On the other hand, he managed to write about Austria and to criticize the Austrian absolutism during Biedermeier without being recognized by Austrian authorities. The end of Biedermeier is marked by the writings of Adalbert Stifter (1805‚Äì1868). His first work Nachsommer was published in 1857, but was still believed to be one of the finest works of biedermeier. Stifter not only influenced Peter Rosegger but also German writers like Ganghofer, Heyse, Freytag, Wildenbruch and later authors (the time of \\"B√ºrgerlichen Realismus\\") like Storm, Fontane and through them Thomas Mann and Hesse. Adalbert Stifter =Realism= Austrian writers of Realism are primarily the writer of short novels Ferdinand von Saar, Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach and the already mentioned Adalbert Stifter. Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach is known for her psychological novels and novellas as well as for her social engagement. Ferdinand K√ºrnberger was a novelist, such as Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, who became famous with Venus in Furs - the erotic behavior he described, would later be called masochism according to his name. Another writer to mention is Bertha von Suttner. She wrote social novels whose literary quality usually is not appreciated highly by literary critiques and Germanists, but Suttner received the Nobel Prize for Peace for her novel Die Waffen nieder (Lay down your arms) in 1905. While in Germany Realism paved the way for Naturalism, a similar literary movement has never developed in Austria. Instead, the successors were Jugendstil and Expressionism. 20th centuryFirst half of the 20th century= Georg Trakl The Jugendstil movement was primarily a cultural movement of architecture and decorative arts. On the other hand, especially the Viennese Jugendstil was marked by the presence of artists of every genre, thus also compositors and writers. The Viennese writers, such as Arthur Schnitzler and Stefan Zweig, are often mentioned in this context. Arthur Schnitzler may be named a very typical writer of that time. He wrote his major works between 1890 and the end of World War I, namely novels, short stories and theater plays. A very important center of Austrian literature during the ca. 20 years before the end of World War I was Prague. It was the center of many German-speaking, mostly Jewish, authors who did not only give important impulses to the entire Austrian and partly even to world literature, but represent a very important part of Austrian literature; their influence endured until the 1930s. Authors to mention are Oskar Baum, Max Brod, Franz Kafka, the journalist Egon Erwin Kisch, Gustav Meyrink, Robert Musil, Rainer Maria Rilke, Franz Werfel, and Oskar Wiener. Expressionism was presented primarily by the poet Georg Trakl and the dramatist and narrator Hugo von Hofmannsthal, both originating from Salzburg. The end of World War I reduced Austria to a very small and mainly German-speaking country. Some Austrian (and German writing) authors opted for the new emerging countries, such as Kafka and Werfel for Czechoslovakia, others migrated, such as Robert Musil to Berlin and Vienna, Rainer Maria Rilke to Vienna and later Paris, Elias Canetti to Vienna. The political rupture and the fact that this small German-speaking Austria had lost most of its territory, industry and agriculture, led to the fatal conviction of many Austrians that only a union with Germany would be able to save the country from a total downfall, a conviction which paved the way to the later annexation by Hitler in 1938. The texts of some writers give an insight to this conviction. Hence, Robert Musil and Hugo von Hofmannsthal expressed their \\"German centric\\" point of view, while others, such as Stefan Zweig, Franz Werfel and Alexander Lernet-Holenia, strictly spoke up for Austria and Austrian tradition and culture. The time between the two world wars gave way to a very rich literature in Austria. Robert Musil wrote the well-known novel The Man without Qualities, Stefan Zweig published a multitude of essays, stories and novels, Karl Kraus edited the magazine Die Fackel (The Torch), for which he wrote almost all articles by himself, Franz Werfel wrote some of his best novels, e.g. The Forty Days of Musa Dagh which narrates the Armenian tragedy of 1915, and after Franz Kafka's death, his life-time friend Max Brod began to publish Kafka's unfinished novels. Later Nobel Prize winner Elias Canetti studied and lived in Vienna and wrote his only novel Auto-da-Fe; before the Anschluss he fled to England. In analogy to Musil's Kakania (from the anagram for the k. u. k., i.e. imperial and royal monarchy till 1918), Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando created Tarockania for the weird figures of his humorous novels and stories. =Austrofascism and Nazi dictatorship= Catholic and conservative Austrofascism came into power after the Austrian Civil War and revitalized censorship. A more important influence on Austrian literature resulted however from Nazi empowerment in Germany in 1933. It has to be understood that not only the majority of German speaking readers live in Germany, but almost all large and important publishers for literature in the German language are situated in Germany as well. In 1933 it came to a breakup at the P.E.N. conference in Dubrovnik. The members discussed an official protest against the prosecution of writers and the burning of books by the Nazis. In consequence the German delegation left the conference and referred to the organization's principle not to interfere with politics. Some members of the Austrian delegation solidarized with the Germans, while others supported the resolution. This breakup continued afterwards in Vienna and led to a separation of liberal and \\"German nationalistic\\" authors; the latter left the Austrian PEN Club and later worshipped Hitler and his annexation of Austria. Nazi Germany observed the events carefully, boycotted immediately the liberal authors, who couldn't go on publishing in Germany and lost most of their readers and income. After the annexation, these authors were prosecuted as well as their German counterparts since years, and many of them, especially the Jewish, were murdered or forced to emigration. Stefan Zweig flew to Brazil, Franz Werfel escaped to the US together with the German writer Heinrich Mann, Elias Canetti to England. Others, like Jura Soyfer, were killed by the Nazis. In 2007, the Theodor Kramer SocietyTheodor Kramer Gesellschaft published an anthology of Austrian poetry written in exile, under the title In welcher Sprache tr√§umen Sie? (In which language do you dream?). The editors present 278 authors whose names in many cases have been wiped out. The better known among them are Ilse Aichinger, Franz Theodor Csokor, Albert Drach, Albert Paris G√ºtersloh, Hermann Hakel, Theodor Kramer, Josef Luitpold Stern, Felix Pollak, Paula von Preradoviƒá, Joseph Roth, Hilde Spiel, Wilhelm Szabo, Hans Weigel, Stefan Zweig. During the Nazi dictatorship, which had factually wiped out the Austrian state, the Austrian PEN Club was in exile in London and continued its work in Austria from 1946 on. Until 1973, PEN was the only Austrian writers' organization of importance. =After World War II: Group of Vienna= The literature after World War II combined much different movements. While some authors were in search for reorientation, such as Ilse Aichinger, Ingeborg Bachmann, Heimito von Doderer, Alexander Lernet-Holenia, Gerhard Fritsch and Hans Lebert, others came back from concentration camps, such as Jean Am√©ry, from former (in times of monarchy) Austrian territories, such as Rose Ausl√§nder and Paul Celan, or from exile, such as Hans Weigel and Friedrich Torberg, while others again did not come back from exile, such as Hermann Broch or Franz Werfel. On the other hand, some former \\"Nazi\\" writers kept their positions, such as Max Mell, Franz Nabl and Karl Heinrich Waggerl. The latter and other, catholic, writers began to form a very conservative block within the Austrian literature. Through the Austrian PEN Club they even seemed to control statal subsidies for literature as well as literary awards till the 1970s. Some authors had good relations to the Group 47 based in Germany or were members. Among them Ilse Aichinger who published the novel Die gr√∂√üere Hoffnung (Greater Hope) and the narrator and poet Ingeborg Bachmann. Both were awarded the Group 47 Prize for Literature. Other Austrian members of the Group 47 were Paul Celan and Erich Fried. While Celan, after some time in Vienna, went to live in Paris, Fried moved to Berlin. In 1954, the Wiener Gruppe (Group of Vienna) was formed by H. C. Artmann and others. Friedrich Achleitner, Konrad Bayer, Gerhard R√ºhm and Oswald Wiener belonged to the group, as well as Ernst Jandl and Friederike Mayr√∂cker. Hans Lebert wrote the novel Wolfshaut (Wolf's Skin), in which he described a fictional village named Schweigen (Silence), an allegory for the silence of many Austrians after the Nazi dictatorship, who pretended to know nothing about what had happened in their country. Several volumes of Diaries contain the war memories of Heimito von Doderer. However, this author was best known for his novels, which he designed meticulously, such as The Strudlhofstiege, The Demons, The Waterfalls of Slunj, and The Merowingians. Doderer influenced many other authors with his novelistic art, e.g. Robert Schindel. =1970‚Äì2000= In 1973, a new writers' association was founded in Graz (Styria), mostly as a protest against the conservativism of P.E.N. and their controlling position, e.g. concerning literature prizes. The new association was called Grazer Autorenversammlung (GAV). Among its founders and first members, you find names, such as Barbara Frischmuth, Peter Handke, Ernst Jandl, Alfred Kolleritsch, Friederike Mayr√∂cker, Michael Scharang, etc. Eventually, the GAV became the largest writers' association in Austria, with more than 500 members. The end of the 1960s and eventually the 1970s were characterized by experimental theater plays. Peter Handke tried out new ways of theater communication with his play Offending the Audience in 1966. Kaspar and The Ride Across Lake Constance are two further examples. Ernst Jandl and Friederike Mayr√∂cker wrote a new sort of experimental poetry, Konkrete Poesie, at a first glance working rather with the sounds of speech than with semantics. One of the most important writers after World War II was Thomas Bernhard (1931‚Äì1989). He wrote nine novels, several books of stories and short prose as well as some autobiographical works, and numerous plays. Repeatedly, his works triggered public controversies, since Bernhard constantly attacked a typical Austrian manner of treating the Nazi past in simply ignoring what had happened. One of the dramas is called Heldenplatz, an open allusion to Vienna's central imperial place, from which Adolf Hitler had held his first speech after the country's annexation by Nazi German troops, in front of hundreds of thousands of cheering Austrians. Marianne Fritz (1948‚Äì2007) got known as a novelist. Her third novel, Dessen Sprache du nicht verstehst (Whose speech you don't understand), was published in 1985. On more than three thousand pages, Fritz describes a linguistic and fictional universe that deals with the decline of the Austrian empire. More than that, she used a very artificial language breaking many linguistic norms, in order to achieve a much more rhythmic speech. Marianne Fritz intensified this individual esthetics with her fourth and fifth novel, which jointly have more than ten thousand pages. During the 1980s, especially after the political scandal around former UN secretary and eventually Austrian federal president Kurt Waldheim, a new and more distinctive Jewish literature formed. Robert Schindel published the novel Gebirtig, which deals with a contemporary Jewish society within Austria and the difficult memories of the Shoah. Robert Menasse is known for his novels and especially for his essays on Austria. Another author who works with Jewish topics, is Doron Rabinovici. Christoph Ransmayr (Foto: Johannes Cizek) Christoph Ransmayr mixes historical facts with fiction. The acclaimed novel Morbus Kithara creates a scenario, in which Austria did not get aid from the Marshall Plan after World War II and was condemned to become an exclusively agrarian country. On this background, the author writes about the time after the war, about ex-soldiers, ex-nazis and concentration camp survivors, and thus depicts the complexity of post-war Austria. Josef Haslinger wrote the novel Opernball, in which he described a fictitious attack at the Vienna Opera Ball, in which all attendants, incl. the entire Austrian government, is killed by combat gas. This attack brings a new fascist party to power, which a handful of idealistic journalists try to tell to the world. Haslinger is also the author of an essay about the Waldheim affair. Also Milo Dor, a born Serb who wrote all of his books in German and became a very important figure in Austria's literary scene, chose the danger of ultra right wing parties as topic for one of his narrative texts, Wien, Juli 1999. Other books describe the destiny of immigrants after the world war. Essays have also a tradition in Austrian literature. While the roots may be found with Franz Grillparzer, Hermann Bahr and especially Karl Kraus, one of the most important essayists after World War II is Jean Am√©ry whose oeuvre primarily consists of essays, articles and critiques. The historian and scholar Friedrich Heer is the author of about fifty thousand pages, most of them essays on Austrian and European topics, on history and philosophy as well as on religion and literature. A younger representative of Austrian essayism is Karl-Markus Gau√ü who writes for several newspapers and magazines in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. His books speak about Central and Eastern European peoples, cultures and literatures. He is also the editor in chief of the magazine Literatur und Kritik. Authors in the Slovene language, originating in Carinthia, are Florjan Lipu≈°, Cvetka Lipu≈° and Janko Messner. Usually they write either exclusively in Slovene, or in Slovene and German. Another famous Carinthian writer, Peter Handke, has translated several works from Slovene to German. =Nobel Prizes for Literature= Elfriede Jelinek In 1981, Elias Canetti (1905‚Äì1994) received the Nobel Prize for Literature. While his birthplace today belongs to Bulgaria, he spent much time, especially between the two world wars, in Vienna and wrote all books in German. After his (forced) emigration to London, he became a British subject. The last years of his life, he lived in Zurich, Switzerland. The most important works are the novel Auto-da-Fe, the essay Crowds and Power, and his vast Diary. Three volumes of memoirs give an insight of Austrian society until World War II and describe the contacts the author had within the literary scene. In 2004, Elfriede Jelinek (*1946) received the Nobel Prize for Literature for her \\"musical flow of voices and counter-voices in novels and plays that, with extraordinary linguistic zeal, reveal the absurdity of society's clich√©s and their subjugating power\\". She lives in Vienna and Munich. Her works comprise novels, such as The Piano Teacher, Lust and Die Kinder der Toten (Children of the Dead), as well as theater plays, such as Clara S., Burgtheater and Bambiland. However, in the 1960s she began to write poetry and stories. 21st century Writer Thomas Glavinic at the HeadRead festival (2012). Writer Michael K√∂hlmeier reading in Olm√ºtz (2009). Writer Wolf Haas reading at the literary festival o-t√∂ne in Vienna (2009). While some of the well-known authors, such as Franzobel, Peter Handke, Peter Henisch, Elfriede Jelinek, Gerhard Roth, Robert Schneider, still publish regularly, there are rich literary movements, mostly driven by a younger generation. In some cases, literary magazines play an important role in gathering writers and fostering their works. =Literary magazines and publishers= Literatur und Kritik and Erostepost are published in Salzburg, Manuskripte, Sterz, Schreibkraft and Lichtungen in Graz, Wespennest and Kolik in Vienna, Cognac & Biskotten in Innsbruck, DUM in Lower Austria. They count among the most traditional and important literary magazines in contemporary Austria. In addition, the literary magazine Buchkultur has been around since 1989. Publishing houses to mention are Residenz, Droschl, Haymon, Zsolnay and Deuticke. Residenz played an important role during the 1970s and 1980s, when numerous important Austrian writers were published there. Especially smaller publishers, such as Arovell, Drava, FZA-Verlag, Mitter, Otto M√ºller, Pichler, Ritter, Skarabaeus, Sonderzahl, Wieser, etc. bring emerging and younger authors to the public. On the other hand, many Austrian writers publish their books in Germany, which offers much larger and powerful publishing houses. Of course, the economic regrouping of publishing houses and their mergers have also an influence on Austrian publishers. Thus, Zsolny and Deuticke already belong to the German publishing group Hanser. =Literature awards and subsidies= In addition to subsidies and awards financed and organized by the Austrian and federal governments, several smaller literary prizes award Austrian and other German writing authors. Alfred-Gesswein-Literaturpreis, Erostepost-Literaturpreis, Franz-Kafka-Preis, Feldkircher Lyrikpreis, Wiener Werkstattpreis, Anton-Wildgans-Preis, and Manuskripte-Preis belong to this aspect of Austrian literature. The scholar Klaus Zeyringer states that public subsidies represent the backbone of today's literary production and especially publishing in Austria, and this would be one reason why the frame conditions obviously differ from those in Germany. Public subsidies add to the funding of publishing houses, literary magazines, public events, book publications, and to the income of writers. Zeyringer points out that on one hand this custom enables also the publication of non-mainstream and complicated literary works but on the other hand reduces the awareness of the necessity of adequate marketing activities of many cultural organizations, including publishers. =Contemporary authors= Book publications, magazines, public readings and literary prizes chronicle and divulge a multitude of writers, i.e. novelists, playwrights, prosaists, essayists and poets, such as Reinhold Aumaier, Zedenka Becker, Adelheid Dahim√®ne, Dimitr√© Dinew, Martin Dragosits, Klaus Ebner, G√ºnter Eichberger, Olga Flor, Karin Geyer, Thomas Glavinic, Constantin G√∂ttfert, Egyd Gst√§ttner, Wolf Haas, Klaus H√§ndl, Ludwig Laher, Gabriel Loidolt, Wolfgang Kauer, Daniel Kehlmann, Michael K√∂hlmeier, Melamar, Wolfgang Pollanz, Doron Rabinovici, Gudrun Seidenauer, Linda Stift, Vladimir Vertlib, Christine Werner, Peter Paul Wiplinger. Usually these authors do not only publish in Austria, but also in Germany and Switzerland. =Cultural melting pot= In its history, the country and the Austrian literature have been a cultural melting pot that put together different ethnicities, mentalities and cultures. Today, this element has shrunk enormously but is still not wiped out. Thus, novelist Zdenka BeckerAlso see Zdenka Becker's homepage and the author's biography at the website of publisher Residenz emigrated from Slovakia, Dimitr√© Dinev from Bulgaria, and Vladimir Vertlib was born in Russia. Very often their topics have to do with immigration and interculturality. There is some literature written by members of the autochthonous minorities in Austria. To mention the daughter of Florjan Lipu≈°, the poet Cvetka Lipu≈°, who has lived in the US for several years. Her poetry has been published in Slovene and in German. Another aspect is the fact that some authors have chosen to live in other countries than Austria, while still writing literature in the German language. Their experiences living in another country do have some impact on their writing. For example, Marlene Streeruwitz and Ann Cotten live in Berlin, Raoul Schrott lived several years in Ireland and also Christoph Ransmayr has moved there.

Life Jean-Fran√ßois R√©gis was born 31 January 1597, in Fontcouverte, Aude, in the Languedoc region of southern France. His father, Jean R√©gis, had recently been ennobled as a result of service rendered during the Wars of the League. His mother, Marguerite de Cugunhan, was of a noble family. He was educated at the Jesuit College of B√©ziers. On 8 December 1616, in his nineteenth year, he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Toulouse and he took his vows two years later. After finishing his course in rhetoric at Cahors, Regis was sent to teach grammar at several colleges: Billom (1619‚Äì22), Puy-en-Velay (1625‚Äì27), and Auch (1627‚Äì28). While he was teaching, he also pursued his studies in philosophy at the scholasticate at Tournon. Noted for an intense love of preaching and teaching the Faith, as well as the desire to save souls, Regis began his study of theology at Toulouse in 1628. Less than two years later, in 1630, he was ordained a priest at 31. The following year, having completed his studies, Regis made his tertianship. Regis was now fully prepared for his lifework and entered upon his apostolic career in the summer of 1631. He was a tireless worker who spent most of his life serving the marginalized. As a newly ordained priest, he worked with bubonic plague victims in Toulouse. From May 1632 until September 1634, his headquarters was at the Jesuit College of Montpellier. Here he labored for the conversion of the Huguenots, visited hospitals, assisted the needy, withdrew from vice wayward women and girls, and preached Catholic doctrine with tireless zeal to children and the poor.Phyllis G. Jestice, Holy People of the World: A Cross-Cultural Encyclopedia (2004), p. 164 Regis is best known for his work with at-risk women and orphans. He established safe houses and found jobs for them. Regis established the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, which organized charitable collections of money and food from the wealthy. He also established several hostels for prostitutes, and helped many become trained lace makers, which provided them with a stable income and an opportunity to avoid the threat of exploitation. In 1633, Regis went to the Diocese of Viviers at the invitation of the local bishop, Monsignor Louis II de la Baume de Suze, giving missions throughout the diocese. From 1633 to 1640 he evangelized more than fifty districts in le Vivarais, le Forez, and le Velay. Regis labored diligently on behalf of both priests and laypersons. His preaching style was said to have been simple and direct. He appealed to the uneducated peasantry and numerous conversions resulted. Regis's labors reaped a harvest of conversions. However, his boldness ‚Äì perceived as arrogance in some cases ‚Äì led to a conflict with certain other priests, a period of tension with the local bishop, and even threats of violence from those whose vices he condemned. Although he longed to devote himself to the conversion of the indigenous inhabitants of Canada, William C. Sturtevant, Handbook of North American Indians, 1978, p. 473. \\"It was named Saint Regis in memory of Jean Francois Regis, a French ecclesiastic canonized in 1737 who before his death in 1640 at the age of 43 had wanted to become a missionary to the Iroquois (Hough 1853:113‚Äì114).\\" he remained in France all his life. Regis walked from town to town, in rough mountainous areas where travel was difficult, especially in the winter. He died of pneumonia at age forty-three on 31 December 1640, at Lalouvesc (Ard√®che), in France's Dauphin√© region. Veneration John Francis Regis was beatified by Pope Clement XI on 18 May 1716, and canonized by Pope Clement XII on 5 April 1737.

Legacy In a 1997 letter to the Bishop of Viviers, Pope John Paul II commemorated the fourth centenary of St. John Francis Regis' birth, honoring him as a ‚Äúlofty figure of holiness‚Äù and an example for the Church in the modern world. Today, Regis' name lives on across the world. There are lakes, mountains, hotels, apartment complexes, swimming pools, and streets with his namesake. Parishes are dedicated to St. John Francis Regis in Arnaudville, Louisiana; Hollywood, Maryland; and Kansas City, Missouri. Regis University, located in Colorado, along with the Regis Campus of Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, are both named in his honor, as well as numerous elementary and high schools worldwide, including Regis High School (New York City), Regis School of the Sacred Heart (Houston, Texas), Regis High School (Stayton, Oregon), Regis High School (Eau Claire, Wisconsin) and Regis Jesuit High School (Aurora, Colorado). St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, where a Roman Catholic church named for him stands, is also named in his honor, due to his admiration for the native inhabitants of North America. The Jesuit mission at Conewago, PA was named after him.

H. Lawrence, published in 1911, though with 1910 on the title page. Lawrence started the novel in 1906 and then rewrote it three times. The early versions had the working title of Laetitia. Maurice Greiffenhagen's 1891 painting 'An Idyll' inspired the novel. The painting had \\"a profound effect\\" on Lawrence, who wrote: \\"As for Greiffenhagen's 'Idyll', it moves me almost as if I were in love myself. Under its intoxication, I have flirted madly this Christmas.\\" The novel is set in the Eastwood area of his youth and is narrated in the first person by a character named Cyril Beardsall. It involves themes such as the damage associated with mismatched marriages, and the border country between town and country. A misanthropic gamekeeper makes an appearance, in some ways the prototype of Mellors in Lawrence's last novel, Lady Chatterley's Lover. The book includes some notable description of nature and the impact of industrialisation on the countryside and the town.  Plot  The novel is set in Nethermere (fictional name for real-life Eastwood) and is narrated by Cyril Beardsall, whose sister Laetitia (Lettie) is involved in a love triangle with two young men, George and Leslie Temple. She eventually marries Leslie, even though she feels sexually drawn to George. Spurned by Lettie, George marries the conventional Meg. Both his and Lettie's marriages end in unhappiness, as George slides into alcoholism at the novel's close.  Publication history  The White Peacock was published on January 19, 1911 by Duffield & Co. in the United States and a day later by Heinemann in the United Kingdom.  Reception  According to the biographer Brenda Maddox, The White Peacock received generally positive reviews in The Observer, The Morning Post, and The Daily News. Maddox writes in that The White Peacock reflects the influence of the German philosophers Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, and that its theme is \\"that Christianity has alienated humankind from nature and destroyed pagan wisdom\\". Maddox describes it as \\"an uneven early work obscured by Lawrence's later books\\", but praises it for its \\"beauty and power\\" and for being \\"rich in images of a nature red in tooth and claw.\\" She argues that while Lawrence's works have been seen as Freudian, the \\"primitive rage against mothers\\" in The White Peacock better fits the ideas of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein. She maintains that the novel has homoerotic elements, apparent in the relationship between George and Cyril, and notes that the novelist E. M. Forster saw it as having sexual implications unrecognised by Lawrence.

However, Zoe exploits Ashley's good nature and runs off to join a cult after Shannon dies of meningitis. In 1999, Ashley and Maxine get back together, and finally marry in September. Ashley also finds out that his uncle, Fred, is actually his biological father. Fred tells Ashley about Kathleen and her reluctance to be a mother at a young age. Fred also explains to Ashley that Beryl, who he believed to be his mother, is actually his aunt, and that Fred let her raise Ashley so he could watch him grow up. Ashley decides that he wants to meet his birth mother but Fred begs him not to, believing it would hurt Beryl. Ashley, however, tracks Kathleen down to her home in Oldham. He is initially very bitter towards her for abandoning him but they reconcile and Ashley lets Kathleen attend his and Maxine's wedding. Ashley and Maxine decide to have a baby and after months of trying, it is discovered that Ashley needs minor surgery. While he is in hospital overnight, Maxine gets drunk and has a one-night stand with local doctor Matt Ramsden (Stephen Beckett) and subsequently becomes pregnant with his child. When Joshua (Benjamin Beresford) is born in 2002, Maxine lets Ashley believe that he is the father and Ashley is named on the birth certificate. Maxine tells Ashley the truth and he is hurt and betrayed by her actions, but he forgives her and agrees to raise Joshua as his son and asks her never to reveal to anybody that he is not Joshua's biological father. In January 2003, Maxine is murdered by Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), leaving Ashley devastated. At Maxine's funeral, her boss Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) causes a scene and accuses Richard of murdering Maxine and attempting to kill her and Emily.

Ashley is further devastated when a blood test confirms that Matt is indeed Joshua's biological father. Ashley realizes that he needs help looking after Joshua and hires a nanny, Claire Casey (Julia Haworth). Ashley and Claire bond over Joshua and they eventually fall in love. In October 2004, Ashley proposes to Claire in The Rovers and she accepts. They get married on Christmas Day 2004. In November 2005, Fred challenges another butcher, Eddie Maddocks, to a boxing match between Ashley and Eddie's son, Marvin, a local boxing champion. On the day of the fight, Fred drops a weight on Ashley's foot and he is hospitalised. Ashley recovers and goes ahead with the fight but a riot breaks out amongst the spectators. In order to restore order, Ashley and Marvin agree on a tie. On their first wedding anniversary in December 2005, Claire tells Ashley that she is pregnant. Their son Thomas is born on 17 July 2006. Around the same time, Matt contacts Ashley and demands access to Joshua. Ashley refuses and the matter goes to court. Eventually, Claire persuades Ashley to make Matt an offer of limited access which he accepts but ends up delivering Claire's baby when she goes into labour and congratulates Ashley on becoming a father himself. Ashley supports Claire when she suffers from post-natal depression and is sectioned after trying to kill Thomas. Ashley stands by Claire during her ordeal and they reconcile when she is allowed home. In October 2006, Ashley is devastated when Fred dies of a stroke. Fred was due to marry Bev Unwin (Susie Blake) but visited his former lover, Audrey's, house. Although Ashley swore that Fred and Audrey were not having an affair, not everyone believed him. Ashley had to cope with losing his father and people gossiping about why Fred had been at Audrey's house. Ashley blamed Audrey for Fred's death because she told him that she loved him and wished he was marrying her instead of Bev. Ashley is comforted by Claire who suggests that they rename their son Freddie, in Fred's honour. Ashley takes over the running of his father's shop. In May 2007, whilst Ashley and Joshua visit Maxine's parents, the Peacocks' house is set on fire. Claire is rescued but Freddie is missing and is later found in a local park. Claire suspects her former friend Casey Carswell (Zoe Henry) but Ashley does not believe her. One day whilst Claire is out, Ashley kisses Casey and they agree to forget it ever happened. However, Casey has no intention of forgetting anything, manipulating Ashley into having an affair. They are almost caught when Claire returns from a trauma support group. Feeling guilty about his affair, Ashley tells Audrey and Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell). Ashley decides to make his marriage work and ends things with Casey but, adamant that Ashley loves her, Casey pesters him constantly. Claire becomes suspicious, as Casey had stayed with Ashley while she was away, and she asks Ashley if he had slept with Casey but he denies it. Casey becomes obsessed with Ashley and is prepared to do anything to get his attention, eventually kidnapping Freddie and takes him to her house, knowing Ashley would come to get him. When Ashley arrives, he is horrified to see Casey has photos of him everywhere. He tries to reason with her but Claire barges in and Audrey, who also accompanied them, calls the police. Claire talks to Casey and she reveals her affair with Ashley. Claire rescues Freddie, and Casey is arrested and admits starting the fire at the Peacocks' house. After Ashley and Casey's affair is revealed, Claire tells Ashley that their marriage is over. He moves out, staying briefly with the Websters before moving in with Audrey, Bill Webster (Peter Armitage) and her grandson, David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd). Ashley sees Joshua and Freddie regularly but it is clear that Claire is angry and hurt by his actions. She struggles with childcare and work but cannot bring herself to forgive Ashley until Audrey convinces her to do so and the couple reconcile. During 2008, Claire is shocked to discover that she and Ashley are struggling financially. Ashley confesses to using their savings to keep the butcher's shop going so Claire discusses housing options with Sally when she mentions that her daughters, Rosie (Helen Flanagan) and Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent), are getting too old to share a room. Ashley and Claire's sons are young enough for room sharing not to be a problem so Claire and Sally decide to swap houses. Initially, Ashley and Kevin are reluctant to move but are persuaded to do so by their wives. The couples agree to value the houses and the Websters agree to give the Peacocks the difference in cash. Eventually, the purchase price is agreed and both families move. In July 2009, Claire is rushed into hospital after collapsing due to a near-fatal blood clot, brought on by a miscarriage. Claire and Ashley were unaware that Claire was pregnant. During her recovery, Claire decides not to have any more children and insists Ashley have a vasectomy. He agrees but when he arrives at the clinic for the surgery, he changes his mind and goes home, telling Claire that he has had it done. Eventually however, he tells her the truth, causing tension between the couple; eventually he agrees to have the operation. On 10 November 2008, Ashley employs Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) at his shop following the teenager's release from a Young Offenders Institution and he and Ashley form a close bond and friendship. Since Autumn 2009, Ashley developed a friendship with Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) due to Claire's newly developed friendship with Steve's wife, Becky (Katherine Kelly). In August 2010, Claire is babysitting Joshua, Freddie, Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett), Asha Alahan (Tanisha Gorey) and Simon Barlow (Alex Bain). She is forced to leave the children when her mother is taken ill and asks Sophie and Sian Powers (Sacha Parkinson) to watch the children. Whilst she is gone, Aadi and Simon have a fight and Aadi hits his head and later collapses and is rushed to hospital. He recovers and Aadi's parents, Dev (Jimmi Harkishin) and Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati), tell the police Claire was babysitting. When Claire is questioned, she tells the police about Sophie and Sian babysitting. Claire later tells Ashley she is concerned that her past mental health problems will be brought up but he reassures her that she has nothing to worry about. The Peacocks are angry with the Alahans for telling the police about Claire. After the police question Sophie and Sian, Sally confronts the Peacocks at Roy (David Neilson) and Hayley Cropper's (Julie Hesmondhalgh) wedding and accuses Claire of using the girls as a scapegoat and causing Aadi's injury herself and mocks her former mental health problems. Claire then reveals that Sophie and Sian are lesbians and that she saw them kissing after returning home but the girls deny it. Ashley and Claire leave the ceremony and Claire shouts at Sophie as they walk past her for letting everyone believe that she is a liar. Claire then goes to stay with her mother and leaves Joshua and Freddie with Ashley. Ashley is angry with Sunita when she comes into the butchers to ask after Claire and he orders her to leave. When the truth is revealed about Simon causing Aadi's injury, Ashley angrily confronts Simon's father Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and accuses Simon of lying to cover his tracks and causing Claire's problems. Peter apologises to Ashley. When Claire returns home, Sunita comes round to apologize but the Peacocks do not accept it and Ashley orders Sunita to leave. In order to put her ordeal behind her, Claire asks Ashley if they can move away from Weatherfield for a fresh start. Ashley is reluctant at first but agrees. However, Claire's mother Yvonne (Yvonne O'Grady) later visits and she convinces Claire to move to France, where she lives. Claire is enthusiastic and agrees but Ashley changes his mind about moving, not wanting to leave the country. In October 2010, Ashley is closing the butcher's shop when he witnesses Graeme get run over by his former friend David. Ashley calls an ambulance and has to restrain Graeme's girlfriend, Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan), David's ex-girlfriend, from attacking David. Ashley and Claire accompany Graeme to the hospital and Ashley believes Claire is having second thoughts about leaving. Ashley is angry with David and accuses him of deliberately running Graeme over, saying some horrible comments. However, upon learning that David had an epileptic fit at the wheel and did not mean to run Graeme over, he feels guilty and apologises off-screen. In order to change Ashley's mind about moving, Claire arranges a romantic meal for them but Ashley realises that she is trying to win him round when he notices that the food and wine is French. Ashley refuses to move again, but suddenly feels a pain in his chest. Believing he is having a heart attack, Claire rushes him to hospital. Ashley discovers that he was suffering from indigestion but he does not tell Claire this and he lets her continue thinking that he has heart problems in order for her to change her mind about moving and it works. Ashley is given indigestion tablets and removes them from their packet and puts them in a biscuit tin in the kitchen. Later, Joshua feeds Freddie one of Ashley's pills and Claire panics and takes Freddie to hospital. Ashley is forced to admit that the tablets were for indigestion and not heart problems. When Claire returns home she apologises to Ashley for forcing him to move and tells him that she will move to France alone, with Joshua and Freddie and leave him behind. Ashley is forced to sleep on the sofa and later gets drunk in The Rovers. Graeme and Tina take him home and let him spend the night at their flat in order to sleep off his hangover. Ashley attends Jack Dobbs' christening and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) asks him how things are between him and Claire. Ashley is forced to admit that his marriage may be over but Jack convinces Ashley to speak to Claire and he does so in The Rovers but they end up arguing again. Jack dies from cancer two weeks later and at his funeral, Ashley comforts Claire. At Jack's wake, Ashley and Claire reconcile and he agrees to move to France with her. Ashley tells Graeme he will be selling the shop. Graeme is upset but wishes Ashley and Claire well. On 6 December 2010, Ashley attends Peter's stag night at The Joinery Bar. Ashley gets drunk and decides to go home. He goes into the office to say goodbye to Peter. He wishes Peter well and tells him never to turn his back on his fianc√©e Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson). He also asks Peter to come and visit himself and Claire in France once they have settled down and the two men embrace. An explosion then tears through The Joinery, severing the overhead railway line and derailing a tram. Ashley is trapped in the office with Peter and bar manager Nick Tilsley (Ben Price). He then helps Nick free Peter who is buried under debris and badly injured. Ashley tries to search for a way out and realises he is seriously injured when he coughs up blood. He then tries to call Claire but gets no reply. He leaves a message on her phone telling her that he loves her and is looking forward to going to France with her and the boys. Ashley and Nick then manage to carry Peter to a hole in the wall after hearing firefighters call out to them. The roof starts to collapse and Ashley is trapped but holds the ceiling up long enough for Nick to pass Peter out to safety. Nick offers to stay behind and help Ashley but realising it is too late to save himself, Ashley shouts at Nick to get out and save himself. The roof then gives way and Ashley is crushed to death. Claire then listens to the voicemail that Ashley left her whilst he was trapped in the joinery. A distraught Claire then goes with Graeme to identify Ashley's body at the morgue. Ashley's funeral was held on 16 December 2010, off-screen. The character has been referred to several times since his death. DevelopmentDeparture= The Peacocks' departure tied in with the show's 50th anniversary celebrations. The anniversary episode was broadcast live on 9 December 2010, with Ashley being killed-off in an explosion, taking place at The Joinery, in which caused a tram to derail onto the street. The character made his final ever appearance on the programme on 10 December 2010, ending his fifteen-year association on the soap. Following his departure, Arnold claimed that he believed his character's death was as of a result of his \\"boozing\\" and \\"bad time-keeping\\", which resulted in him receiving multiple warnings over his lack of professionalism. Reception For his portrayal of Ashley, Arnold was nominated in the category of \\"Most Popular Actor\\" at the 1999 National Television Awards.

S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, Brill, p. 530.  Mythology  Gaius Julius Hyginus described her in the preface to his Fabulae as daughter of Aether and Hemera (Fab. Praef., 2). With her male counterpart Pontus, she spawned the storm gods and the tribes of fish. The couple were later replaced by the other marine pairs, Oceanus and Tethys, Poseidon and Amphitrite.The ‚ÄúThalassa‚Äù article on Theoi Nevertheless, fables were devoted to her by Aesop and she was to be depicted in both artistic and literary works during the Common Era. Some rare sources also attribute to her the sea-nymph Halia (Diodorus Siculus 5.55.4) and the goddess Aphrodite after the severed member of Ouranos was cast into the sea (Nonnus, Dionysiaca 12.43).Theoi  Literature  Thalassa defends herself in Aesop's fable, \\"The Farmer and the Sea\\" Two rather similar fables are recorded by Babrius. In one, numbered 168 in the Perry Index, a farmer witnesses a shipwreck and reproaches the sea for being ‚Äúan enemy of mankind‚Äù. Assuming the form of a woman, she answers by blaming the winds for her turbulence. Otherwise ‚ÄúI am gentler than that dry land of yours.‚ÄùBabrius II.22 In the other, a survivor from a shipwreck accuses the sea of treachery and receives the same excuse. But for the winds, ‚Äúby nature I am as calm and safe as the land.‚ÄùBabrius I.71 In yet another fable, Perry‚Äôs number 412 and only recorded by Syntipas, the rivers complain to the sea that their sweet water is turned undrinkably salty by contact with her. The sea replies that if they know as much, they should avoid such contact. The commentary suggests that the tale may be applied to people who criticize someone inappropriately even though they may actually be helping them.Aesopica In the 2nd century AD, Lucian represented Thalassa in a comic dialogue with Xanthus, the god of the River Scamander, who had been attacked by a rival Greek deity for complaining that his course was being choked with dead bodies during the Trojan War. In this case he had been badly scorched and asks her to soothe his wounds.‚ÄùConfabulations of the Marine Deities XI‚Äù, Lucian of Samosata Vol.1, London 1820, pp.355-6 Art Illustration of coral with the goddess at the base, from a 6th-century medical discourse While the sea-divinities Tethys and Oceanus were formerly represented in Roman-era mosaics, they were replaced at a later period by the figure of Thalassa, especially in Western Asia. There she was depicted as a woman clothed in bands of seaweed and half submerged in the sea, with the crab-claw horns that were formerly an attribute of Oceanus now transferred to her head. In one hand she holds a ship's oar, and in the other a dolphin.≈ûehnaz Eraslan, ‚ÄúTethys and Thalassa in mosaic art‚Äù, Art Sanat 4 (2015)] In 2011, Swoon created a site-specific installation depicting the goddess in the atrium of the New Orleans Museum of Art.

Founded in 1899, it is one of the oldest and best institutions in Singapore. It is a full school with both primary and secondary divisions, admitting girls between the ages of 6 and 16. The secondary division was among the first schools in Singapore to be accorded the status of an independent school in 1989, and entry is competitive.  History  Foundation Years = Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS) was founded as an all-girls Peranakan school in July 1899 by a group of Straits Chinese men, namely Lim Boon Keng, Song Ong Siang and Khoo Seok Wan. The school's premises were located at Hill Street. The school‚Äôs faculty consisted of an English headmistress, and had an enrollment of seven girls. In 1923, the school left its premises at Hill Street (the site later became the Central Fire Station) and moved to Emerald Hill. The premises at Emerald Hill costed . The school building was a two-storey block with 12 classrooms, an assembly hall, a staff room, and a principal‚Äôs office. From 1905 to 1936, the school admitted a handful of male students, but afterwards reverted to being an all- girls school. After 1946, newly created government laws forced the school to accept girls of all races. By 1950, Singapore Chinese Girls‚Äô School had an enrollment of 700 girls, which rose to 900 in 1952. = Attainment of Independent Status = In 1989, SCGS celebrated its 90th birthday and became an independent school, with more latitude to expand the curriculum. On 4 July 1994, after 70 years at Emerald Hill, the school moved to a newly built campus at Dunearn Road. In 2011, SCGS was presented the School Excellence Award, a pinnacle award under the Ministry of Education's (MOE) Masterplan of Awards, which recognizes schools for excellence in both education methods and results. In addition, SCGS received the Best Practice Award for all three categories (Student All-Round Development, Teaching and Learning, and Staff Well-being) and the Outstanding Development Award for National Education. These achievements affirm the school‚Äôs holistic education for the pupils as well as the capacity and commitment of the staff. = Introduction of Joint Integrated Programme = In 2012, MOE announced that SCGS and five other schools would offer the Integrated Programme (IP). However, SCGS would continue to offer the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level Programme to existing and incoming students. In January 2013, SCGS accepted the first batch of IP students in the Secondary One intake alongside new students on the 'O' Level programme. After four years at SCGS, IP students will bypass the 'O' Level examination and move on to Eunoia Junior College. The junior college was newly created as part of a Joint Integrated Programme (JIP) to accept IP students from SCGS, CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School and Catholic High School starting from 2017. Besides IP students, Eunoia Junior College will also accept students from other secondary schools with 'O' Level qualifications. All students enrolled in Eunoia Junior College will sit for the Singapore-Cambridge GCE 'A' Level examination after a two-year programme.  School Identity & Culture Crest= The colours of the school crest are jade and gold. This reflects her time-honoured tradition, because jade and gold in Hokkien (Kim Gek), which is the colloquial name for SCGS girls and alumni, and in Mandarin (JinYu) connotes a young Peranakan Chinese girl brought up and educated in the best manner.https://scgs.moe.edu.sg/about-scgs/our-beliefs/ The school motto is \\"Sincerity, Courage, Generosity and Service.\\" The Yin and yang aspects of the traditional Chinese culture symbol of balance are in jade and gold respectively. This symbol, which represents the universe, light, darkness, life and death, lies at the heart of the many branches of classical Chinese sciences, philosophy and medicine.

Biography Vojnoviƒá was born in Dubrovnik as the first son of Count Konstantin Vojnoviƒá (1832‚Äì1903) and Maria de Serragli (1836‚Äì1922) on 9 October 1857 in Dubrovnik, the Habsburg Monarchy. He was a member of the Serbian noble House of Vojnoviƒá through his father. His mother was of noble Florentine descent. The city of his birth and its history had an important influence on his later literary work. Most of his childhood however he spent in Split. He had a famous younger brother Lujo Vojnoviƒá, who would later play an important political and cultural role in the late 19th- and 20th-century Dalmatia and Montenegro. As a young man he moved to Zagreb with his family, where he graduated from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Law in 1879. Until 1884 he served as a trainee of the Royal Court Table in Zagreb. After that he continued his judicial career in Kri≈æevci (1884-1889), Bjelovar (1889), Zadar (1889-1891). In 1893, Vojnoviƒá wrote a short play Gunduliƒáev san (lit. Gunduliƒá's Dream) that was published in Dubrovnik at the time of the unveiling of the Gunduliƒá monument, which explicitly advocated a unity of Croats and Serbs in Dubrovnik. In 1899, he obtained employment at the court in Dubrovnik, then moved to Supetar on the island of Braƒç, then to Zadar, and again to Supetar. His career in the judiciary ended in 1907 when he was fired from the office in Supetar because of financial wrongdoing, and stripped of pension rights. In 1907 he became the dramaturg at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. At this time, Vojnoviƒá's pro-Serbian ideas were apparent from his work, in which he enthusiastically supported the unification of South Slavs under Serbia. Prior to the Balkan Wars, Vojnoviƒá wrote plays that showed great pride in his origins, however, that would not augur well during World War I when his country got invaded. In 1911 travelled to Italy, Prague, Budapest, Belgrade. In his 1912 visit to Belgrade he publicly claimed he had Serbian noble descent. In 1914 he went back to Dubrovnik where the Austrian-Hungarian government imprisoned him in a ≈†ibenik jail under charges of being a Yugoslavian nationalist. After four months, on Christmas Eve 1914 he was relocated to a prison near Linz, Austria. He was detained without trial for three years by his Austrian captors. In 1917 he was finally transferred to the Sisters of Mercy Hospital in Zagreb. There, unsuccessful attempts were made to cure some severe eye ailments that he had contracted while being incarcerated. After World War I ended, in 1919 he moved to France, where he mostly lived in Nice until 1922 when he moved back to Dubrovnik. Because of his claims of being a nobleman, and because of his unrestrained Yugoslavism, by 1924 Miroslav Krle≈æa had engaged in a public feud with him, calling him a fake count and a drama dilettante. In 1928, Vojnoviƒá's eye problems became acute, threatened with blindness, and in ill health, he went to Serbia to be treated in a sanatorium in Krunska street, Vraƒçar, Belgrade. He died there in 1929. He was buried in Dubrovnik. Works Vojnoviƒá entered literature in 1880 when August ≈†enoa's Vienac published his short story \\"Geranijum\\" under the pseudonym Sergej P. Matica hrvatska under the leadership of Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski published his novels Perom i olovkom in (1884) and Ksanta (1888) under the same pseudonym. Vojnoviƒá was the author of dramas of naturalistic cut, inspired by the literary and patriotic traditions of the Republic of Dubrovnik. He is known for his Dubrovaƒçka trilogija (Zagreb, 1902), which was later translated into English and published in Graz in 1922 under the title of \\"Dubrovnik Trilogy\\". The book describes the fall of the Dubrovnik Republic. His other works include: Death of the Mother of the Jugoviƒá (1906) and Resurrection of Lazarus (1913). He is the author of psychological dramas such as: Lady of the Sunflower (1912; filmed in 1918 by Michael Curtiz), and of pieces such as: Dance of Masks in the Attic (1922), which reflect the influence of Luigi Pirandello on Vojnoviƒá. His play Equinox (Ekvinocij, 1898) was in 1942 put to opera with the same title by the Slovene composer Marjan Kozina. Legacy The ethnicity and nationality of Ivo Vojnoviƒá is a disputed matter. His brother Lujo Vojnoviƒá had actively taken part in the Serb Catholic movement in 19th century Dubrovnik, unlike Ivo. In 1921, Serbian literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá wrote: \\"Ivo Vojnoviƒá is one of those writers who are in the middle of two literatures and one language, between Serbian and Croatian. He started his work exclusively in Croatian literature, but in time proceeded towards Serbian motif and began writing for the Serbian literary public as well.\\"Skerliƒá, Jovan: Istorija nove srpske knji≈æevnosti (History of Modern Serbian Literature, Belgrade, 1921, p. 453 In 2005, Serbian literature professor Du≈°an Ivaniƒá listed Ivo Vojnoviƒá in an anthology of Serb writers from Croatia, which prompted protests in Croatia. In 2010, the National and University Library in Zagreb and the Dubrovnik branch of Matica hrvatska published the combined letters of Ivo Vojnoviƒá, in three volumes, collected by Tihomil Ma≈°troviƒá and edited by Luko Paljetak. His letters were interesting for their sheer volume--over 1,700 pages--the number of languages Vojnoviƒá had used, and some personal peculiarities that led to him being called a dandy.

The largest island in the archipelago is Shortland Island (originally called Alu). Other large islands include Balalae, Faisi, Fauro, Magusaiai, Masamasa, Ovau, Pirumeri and Poporang. Early European involvement The island group, and the largest island, were named by Royal Navy officer John Shortland in 1788. Shortland was the naval commander of a 1777‚Äì79 voyage by the First Fleet to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay, Australia. Germany later claimed the islands and owned them as part of the North Solomon Islands Protectorate until 1900. World War II On March 30, 1942, Japanese war ships entered Shortland Harbor and landed two special naval landing force platoons and met no resistance. One platoon remained in the area to begin establishing Shortland Harbor Seaplane Base. They established the base, seaplane moorings and fortifications in Tuha Channel and the adjoining land on the southeastern portion of Shortland Island, on Faisi and on the northern portion of Poporang. On the night of 29‚Äì30 June 1943, and three other cruisers bombarded Poporang Island in preparation for the invasion of New Georgia. The Allies considered invading the seaplane base in August 1943, but chose instead to bypass the Shortlands for Bougainville and the Treasury Islands, leaving the Shortlands under Japanese control until the war's end. On 1 November 1943, Montpelier shelled the Japanese defenses on Poporang and Balalae. On 8 January 1944, an Allied force of two light cruisers and five destroyers bombarded the installations on Faisi, Poporang, and Shortland Island. In March 1944, planes from the USAAF's 70th Fighter Squadron used reconnaissance photographs taken by the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron to strike the seaplane base, claiming eight float planes and an IJN destroyer. On 20 May 1944, Montpelier received light damage from return fire when she and two other light cruisers, along with eight destroyers, bombarded shore installations on Shortland, Poporang, and Magusaiai Islands. On 1 October 1944, the US Navy's Special Air Task Force (SATFOR) launched four TDR drones on antiaircraft gun positions on Poporang and Balalae.

Life Discovered by Georges Chatelain, his producer, who signed (with Jack Robinson as a co-producer) a contract with Disc' AZ and Lucien Morisse, who was then the program director at Europe 1. Most of his repertoire was original, but at the beginning of his career he performed a few interesting covers of songs by Lee Hazlewood and Fred Neil. \\"Summer Wine\\", for example, which Lee Hazlewood originally sang with Nancy Sinatra, was covered by Marchal in 1969 in a duet with Martine Habib, a young singer whom he met at CBE Studios and whose voice is reminiscent of Joan Baez. Marchal also chose to interpret the song in English; a French translation appeared this same year (\\"Le vin de l'√©t√©\\" by Marie Lafor√™t and G√©rard Klein). One of Marchal's greater successes, \\"Un √©tranger dans la ville\\", is a version of \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" by Fred Neil. (Harry Nilsson sang the original version for the credits of John Schlesinger's film Midnight Cowboy.) Marchal also sang \\"Je suis n√© sous une √©toile filante\\" (a Lerner and Loewe song translated to French by Mr. Vidalin) and \\"Buddy River\\" (a Lee Hazlewood song translated by Vline Buggy and Yves Dessca). The success of these two singles during the summer of 1970 propelled Marchal to the front of the French music scene and to first place in the hit parade. In 1971, \\"Libert√©\\" by Charles Orieux and Jean-max Riviere was also an immense success for him reaching No.5 in the French charts on 25 March 1972. Marchal has written several songs, both solo (\\"Nous vivrons tous les trois\\", \\"Ne pleure pas ma mie\\") or with his friends and producers at CBE, George Chatelain and Bernard Estardy (\\"Dieu qu'elle √©tait belle\\", \\"Quand je te regarde vivre\\"). In the 1970s and 1980s, Marchal continued to record. Little by little, he gave up his \\"cowboy\\" persona in favor of the \\"new man\\". In homage to the Paris area, he sang the anthem \\"Les pr√©noms de l'Ile de France\\" (words by Claude Lemesle) in 1977. The following year, he released an album at Sonopresse containing his own words and music. Songs such as \\"Dr√¥le de vie\\" were a great success both in France and abroad, as well as \\"C'√©tait en France\\" and lighter songs like \\"Miss Pharmago\\" and \\"C'est pas la Chine\\". In 1985, Marchal recorded a 45 of \\"Celine\\" (by Vline Buggy, Hugues Aufray and Mort Shuman); the B side featured \\"Les maisons sans visage\\", with music by Marchal and lyrics by Vline Buggy. Gilles Marchal retired from show business in 1985. He died on 11 April 2013.

It is the westernmost village in the City of Blue Mountains, located about by road from the Sydney central business district and at an altitude of about . The settlement had a population of 823 people at the 2011 Census. History Imperial Hotel, Mount Victoria Mount Victoria is located on an escarpment plateau extension of Mount York, the site of a camp on the original Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813. The area was originally marked as One Tree Hill on an early map dating from 1834 by the Surveyor General, Sir Thomas Mitchell. This is why when the township was established in 1866 it was known as One Tree Hill. After the road across the Blue Mountains was constructed a toll bar was opened about east from the present township in 1849 and the area was also known as Broughton's Waterhole Toll Bar. Coaches were charged at the toll according to how well sprung they were, ones without springs were not charged as it was believed they would help crush the road surface. After the railway station, marking the termination of the Main Western railway line, was opened in 1868 the town also became known as Mount Victoria. The town's name was officially changed after the first Post Office was built in 1876. By the late 19th century, the town had become a prosperous settlement and many private schools, including The School, Mount Victoria, were founded in the area, which become somewhat of a hill station retreat for wealthy Sydney families.  Heritage listings  Mount Victoria has a number of heritage-listed sites, including the following sites listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register: * Blue Mountains National Park: Blue Mountains walking tracks * Main Western railway: Mount Victoria railway station * Mount York Road (off): Cox's Road and Early Deviations - Mount York, Cox's Pass Precinct The following site are listed on other heritage registers: * Mount Victoria Manor was built in 1876 and was the home of the Fairfax family for some years before being converted to a hotel. * Imperial Hotel: The Imperial Hotel was constructed in 1878 and is significant for being the only hotel in the Blue Mountains to trade continuously under its own name. The hotel closed in 2016 pending renovations. * St Peter's Anglican Church: Designed by architect David Macbeath and built of sandstone in 1874-1875 by contractor Alexander Armstrong, this is the oldest Christian Church in the Blue Mountains. * Toll House: Constructed in 1849 the Toll House is one of only two surviving toll houses in New South Wales, the second oldest building in the Blue Mountains and one of only two surviving pre 1950s cottages in the Blue Mountains. * Mount Victoria Post Office: A federation style building constructed in 1896-1897. * Gatekeeper's Cottage: Constructed in 1868 this is one of only six remaining of twelve original gatekeeper's cottages in the Blue Mountains. * Mount Victoria Public School: Completed in 1877 it is possibly the oldest public school in the Blue Mountains. The building is currently operating as a child care centre. =Asgard Swamp coal mine= Asgard Swamp Coal Mine To the south-east of Mount Victoria lies the Asgard Swamp area, now part of the Blue Mountains National Park. The area is the site of a coal mine that was developed in the nineteenth century, but which was ultimately unsuccessful. Six adits were driven into the coal seam by Walter Mackenzie and Thomas Garret, circa 1881. A coke oven was built and it was also proposed to build a tramline from Mount Victoria, but it is not known if this ever happened. The leases changed hands a few times over the years, but no work was done after 1908.Mount Wilson.com.au Around the south and east edges of Asgard Swamp, there are the remains of huts used by the people who worked the mines. =Mount Victoria cemetery= Berghofer grave at Mount Victoria Cemetery Mount Victoria Cemetery, located one and a half kilometres south-east of the township, was established in 1881. Notable internees include John Berghofer, the builder of Berghofer's Pass at Mount York. (The pass, no longer used for vehicular traffic, has since been included in a network of walking tracks at Mount York. The Mount York area is now heritage-listed.)State Heritage Register Other internees include members of the Lanfranchi family, owners of Marthaville, a heritage-listed house on the Great Western Highway.State Heritage Register Present day Today, Mount Victoria is a small township with a large number of historic buildings and a few attractions including the Post Office, a Hall which is used as a cinema, the Imperial Hotel, the Toll Keepers Cottage and a museum at the railway station. The town is the starting point for many bushwalks and features several lookouts over the Kanimbla Valley including the lookout from Mount Piddington. The railway station, along with Lithgow, is the terminus for the Blue Mountains Line. The town is located at the junction of the Great Western Highway and the Darling Causeway to Bell. The Roads and Maritime Services is at present researching a major upgrade to the Great Western Highway with the view to bypass the township and the steep Victoria Pass down to Little Hartley to the west. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,016 people in Mount Victoria. 72.7% of people were born in Australia and 84.0% of people spoke only English at home.

An Irish passport enables the bearer to travel internationally and serves as evidence of Irish nationality and citizenship of the European Union. It also facilitates the access to consular assistance from both Irish embassies and any embassy from other European Union member states while abroad. Irish passports are issued by the Passport Office, a division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. All Irish passports have been biometric since 2006. In 2015, the Irish government introduced the Passport Card, which enables Irish citizens who already possess a passport to travel throughout the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. An Irish Passport Card is intended for travel and identification purposes and functions similarly to an EEA national identity card. Both Irish passports and Irish passport cards allow Irish citizens to travel, live, and work without restriction in any country within the EEA, Switzerland and the Common Travel Area. Irish citizens have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 185 countries and territories; the international access available to Irish citizens ranks 6th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index. History The Irish Free State was created in 1922 as a dominion of the British Commonwealth, modelled explicitly on the Dominion of Canada. At the time, dominion status was a limited form of independence and while the Free State Constitution referred to \\"citizens of the Irish Free State\\", the rights and obligations of such citizens were expressed to apply only \\"within the limits of the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State\\". The Irish Free State first notified the UK Government that it proposed to issue its own passports in 1923. The Irish government initially proposed that the description they would give citizens in their passports would be \\"Citizen of the Irish Free State\\". According to a report from The Irish Times the first time that Irish passports were used was by the Irish delegation to the League of Nations in August 1923. The British Government objected to this. It insisted that the appropriate description was \\"British subject\\", because, inter alia, the Irish Free State was part of the British Commonwealth. The Irish government considered the British viewpoint. The Governor-General subsequently informed the British government that the description that would generally be used (with some exceptions) would be \\"Citizen of the Irish Free State and of the British Commonwealth of Nations\\". Without reaching agreement with the UK, the Irish government issued its first passports to the general public on 3 April 1924, using this description. The British Government was not satisfied with this compromise. It instructed its consular and passport officers everywhere, that Irish Free State passports were not to be recognised if the holder was not described in the passport as a \\"British Subject\\". This led to considerable practical difficulty for Irish Free State citizens abroad with many having to obtain British passports in addition to their Irish Free State passports. The British consular officers would also confiscate the Irish Free State passports, a practice the Irish authorities regarded as \\"very humiliating\\". The stalemate as regards Irish passports continued until January 1930 when the Irish authorities reluctantly accepted a compromise formula originally suggested by the Irish Minister for External Affairs, Desmond Fitzgerald, in 1926.‚ÄòIrish Nationality and Citizenship since 1922‚Äô by Mary E. Daly, in ‚ÄòIrish Historical Studies‚Äô Vol. 32, No. 127, May, 2001 (pp. 377-407) The Irish authorities issued a circular letter to British consular and passport authorities agreeing that Irish passports would be changed so that they were issued by the Minister for External Affairs in the name of the King using the King‚Äôs full title; would describe the bearer as \\"one of His Majesty‚Äôs subjects of the Irish Free State\\"; and if passports were issued to persons other than subjects of His Majesty, that fact would be stated.‚ÄòIrish Nationality and Citizenship since 1922‚Äô by Mary E. Daly, in ‚ÄòIrish Historical Studies‚Äô Vol. 32, No. 127, May, 2001 (pp. 377-407) This formula settled the thorny issue. In 1939, two years after the adoption of the Constitution of 1937, which formally renamed the state \\"Ireland\\", the Irish government decided to make significant changes to the form of Irish passports. As a courtesy, the Irish authorities notified the British authorities. In a memorandum dated 1 March 1939 entitled \\"The Form of Eire Passports\\", the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Thomas W.H. Inskip, informed his Government of developments which had recently taken place \\"regarding the form of passports issued by the Government of Eire\\".British Archives, Memorandum to Cabinet dated 1 March 1939 by Thomas WH Inskip In the memorandum, the Secretary of State reported that \\"hitherto [the passports] (which have not, I understand, been amended since 1936 have borne two indications of relationship to the British Commonwealth of Nations\\". These, the memorandum noted, were the reference to the King including his full title in the \\"request\\" page; and a front page, where underneath the words \\"Irish Free State\\" (in Irish, English and French) appear the words \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". The proposals notified by the Irish authorities included replacing the reference to \\"Irish Free State\\" with \\"Ireland\\"; amending the \\"request\\" page to drop reference to the King; and dropping the reference to the \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". The Secretary of State proposed that he reply to the Irish authorities in terms that \\"His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom greatly regrets the proposed elimination of the King's name from √âire passports; that in their view, the omission, when it comes to be known, is bound to create a bad impression in the UK and to widen the separation which Mr de Valera deplores between √âire and Northern Ireland\\". The Secretary of State noted in his memorandum that to \\"say more than this might raise questions [relating to whether or not Ireland was still in the Commonwealth] which it was the object of the statement of the 30th December 1937, to avoid\\". This was a reference to the communique published by Downing Street noting the adoption of the Irish Constitution, stating that in their view Ireland continued to be part of the Commonwealth and affirming the position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Ultimately, the Irish proceeded with their plans including that the term \\"Citizen of the Irish Free State and of the British Commonwealth of Nations\\" would be replaced with \\"Citizen of Ireland\\". This has remained the description up to present time, with current Irish passports describing the holder as a \\"citizen of Ireland\\" on the request page and giving the holder's nationality as \\"√âireannach/Irish\\" on the information page. The evolution of the physical description of the passport utilised by Irish citizens from 3 April 1924 to 1 January 1985 (when the new European passports were introduced) was one of change. Prior to the first usage of an Irish passport in 1924, Irish citizens were issued with a 32-page British Passport, which had a navy blue hardcover with an embossed British coat of arms. Above the coat of arms the identifer \\"British Passport\\" was printed, while below the coat of arms the inscription \\"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\\" was printed. It also contained two cut-outs in the cover, which allowed the bearer's name and the passport number to be displayed. The first Irish passport, issued to the general public from 3 April 1924, contained a green hardcover with the Irish coat of arms, the harp, embossed in the centre. The passport was bilingual in Irish and English whereby, encircling the Harp was the national inscription of \\"Saorst√°t √âireann\\" and \\"Irish Free State\\", while above the coat of arms the identifier \\"Pas\\" and \\"Passport\\" was printed. It also contained a cut-out for the bearer's name. Following the enactment of the Irish constitution, the physical appearance of the Irish passport changed again. While it retained the green colour and the embossed harp at the centre, the number of languages on the cover changed to three, with French joining Irish and English. To the left of the harp, the national inscription \\"√âire\\", \\"Ireland\\", and \\"Irlande\\" was printed in a row, while to the right of the harp, the identifier \\"Pas\\", \\"Passport\\", and \\"Passeport\\" was printed. The 1970s saw a slight change to the document: while the national inscription was made bigger in the three languages, and moved to the top right corner, the identifier \\"passport\\" was also enlarged, and moved to the bottom left corner of the cover. On 23 June 1981, during the Council meeting of the Member States of the European Communities (now the European Union), a resolution was agreed to make all member states passports more uniform.Resolution of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Communities, Meeting Within the Council of 23 June 1981. Official Journal of the European Communities. C 241. also EUR-Lex - 41981X0919 - EN Fanning, Mary. (12 November 1984). Green Passport Goes Burgendy 1984: New Passports for European Member States Will Have a Common Look and Format. RTE News Archives The European Union Encyclopedia and Directory. (1999). 3rd Ed. p63 . This change, which included changing the colour of all member states passports to burgundy was to see the first European passports from 1 January 1985. However, only three member states (Denmark, Ireland, and Italy) had implemented this change on the specified date, with all other member states complying later. Irish citizens in possession of the old green Irish passports could still make use of their passports until they expired. =\\"Sale\\" of passports in 1988‚Äì1998= A 1988 scheme was designed to draw foreign investment into Ireland, described in a 1998 Seanad debate as the \\"Passports for investment scheme\\" Each had to invest $1,000,000 and live in Ireland for varying periods. The scheme was scrapped in 1998. Before long it was being described as the \\"sale\\" of passports in the media, but only 143 passports were passed on under the scheme. Notable applicants included some of the Getty family, Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz and Khalid Sabih Masri. Masri had lent IR¬£1,100,000 to the pet food company of Taoiseach Albert Reynolds. Another was Norman Turner from Manchester, whose proposed investment was to build a casino in Dublin's Phoenix Park. Turner had entertained Bertie Ahern and had paid ¬£10,000 in cash to his party, and received his passport later in 1994. The matter was revealed during the Mahon Tribunal hearings in 2008; Mr Ahern commented that Mr Turner had an Irish mother, and that in 2007 some 7,000 other passport applications were assisted in some way by politicians. The 2006 Moriarty Tribunal report covered the grant of passports to a Mr Fustok and some of his friends. Mr Fustok had previously bought a yearling horse from Taoiseach Charles Haughey for IR¬£50,000. The Tribunal considered that \\"The explanation advanced for the payment, namely that it was in consideration for the purchase of a yearling, is highly unconvincing and improbable\\". Passport-granting officials have also sold passports illegally, notably Kevin McDonald while working in London, who had sold \\"hundreds\\" of passports to criminals for up to ¬£15,000 each in the 1980s, grossing $400,000. McDonald was prosecuted in 1989 and was sentenced to 21 months in jail. =Increased demand following Brexit= After the UK's Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, tens of thousands of Britons as well as many residents in Northern Ireland, applied for an Irish Passport. Senator Neale Richmond, chairman of the Brexit Committee in the Seanad, described in October 2018 the fast growth in the number of Irish passport applications received from the United Kingdom since the Brexit vote. There were 46,229 applications in 2015, the year before the referendum, \\"consistent with the annual average up to then\\". In 2016, the year of the Brexit vote, 63,453 applications were received, and there were 80,752 applications in 2017. In first half of 2018, the number was already at 44,962 applications. Richmond stated that, \\"Embassy officials predict that based on this, 2018 will be the busiest year so far for Irish passport applications in the UK.\\" 98,544 applications for Irish passports were received from Great Britain in 2018, an increase of 22% on the previous year. The number of applications from Northern Ireland increased by 2% to 84,855. Passport booklet The biodata page of a contemporary Irish passport =Physical appearance= Irish passport booklets use the standard European Union design, with a machine-readable identity page and 32 or 66 visa pages. The cover bears the harp, the national symbol of Ireland. The words on the cover are in both of Ireland's official languages, Irish and English. The top of the cover page reads and the equivalent in English, European Union. Just above the harp are the words and its equivalent in English, Ireland. The identity page on older Irish passport booklets was on the back cover of the booklet. Newly issued passport booklets have been redesigned with additional security features. The identity page is now a plastic card attached between the front cover and the first paper page (the \\"Observations\\" page). The ePassport or biometric passport, was launched on 16 October 2006 with the first ePassports presented that day by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. * Photo of passport holder, printed in greyscale. * Type (P) * Country (IRL) * Passport number * 1.

The background of the identity page is a complex celtic design, with the words \\"√âire Ireland\\" occasionally woven into the design. The identity picture is now greyscale, and is digitally printed onto the surface of the page, rather than the actual photos sent by the applicant being pasted onto the page. The Irish harp is superimposed as a hologram onto the bottom right corner of the photograph. The words \\" Ireland\\" are embossed several times into either side of the identity page. This embossing partially covers the photograph as an added security measure. A likeness of the photograph of the applicant is pin-punched into the surface of the identity page, and can be viewed when the identity page is held to light. Under UV light, fluorescing fibres are visible on every page except the data page. The first sentence of Article 2 of the Irish constitution is visible under UV light and is printed in both Irish and English on alternate pages. The 2013 version of the passport also reveal a topographical map of Ireland on the observations page. Later pages include such landmarks as the Cliffs of Moher, the Samuel Beckett Bridge and the Aviva Stadium; there are excerpts from poems in Irish (by Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill), English (by William Butler Yeats) and Ulster Scots (by James Orr) and from the score of the national anthem, , ().; Passport Card A credit card-sized Passport Card was introduced on 5 October 2015. It was originally announced as being available in mid-July 2015 but was subsequently delayed. It conforms to international standards for biometric and machine readable travel documents promulgated by ICAO. Unlike the United States Passport Card, which cannot be used for international air travel or for land and sea travel outside North America, the Irish passport card can be used for air travel and throughout the European Economic Area and Switzerland and some non-EEA countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Montenegro, Kosovo, Montserrat (max. 14 days in transit to a third country). However, at introduction, it was only publicised as having been approved for entry and exit by countries in the EEA. A few days afterwards it was confirmed that Switzerland had given its approval.Written answers to questions asked in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday, 13 October 2015 quoted in kildarestreet.com and accessed 2 December 2015: \\"Q 345: Paul Murphy (Dublin South West, Socialist Party) To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade further to Parliamentary Question No. 483 of 10 February 2015, and the contradictory information on the Department website (details supplied), if he will confirm whether the passport card is valid for travel to Switzerland. [35223/15]. A 345: Charles Flanagan (Minister, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Laois-Offaly, Fine Gael) On 5 October I launched the passport card which will facilitate travel by Irish citizens within all thirty countries of the European Union and the European Economic Area. Last week, my Department, through the Embassy in Berne, received confirmation from the authorities in Switzerland that they will also accept the passport card for travel. Our website has been updated accordingly.\\" The Irish Passport Card is a passport in card format and is intended to be usable as a travel document in most European countries, in a similar way to national identity cards elsewhere in the EEA. It is largely treated in the same way as an identity card in several other EU countries,There are references for Sweden and UK nine words to the right since that is what their laws call such cards. However, the IATA Timatic database used by airlines to find out document requirements lists the passport card as a separate document type. In addition, Serbia and North Macedonia, who accept identity cards from other EU countries, have stated they do not accept the Irish passport card, meaning Irish citizens remain obliged to present a passport book when entering those countries. The card uses the designation \\"IP\\" in its machine readable zone (MRZ) (the \\"I\\" means identity card and the \\"P\\" is without meaning in the MRZ standard). Although ICAO began preparatory work on machine readable passport cards as early as 1968, Ireland was the first country to issue one for air travel and the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charles Flanagan, highlighted the novelty and utility of Ireland's Passport Card at its 2015 introduction. The card costs ‚Ç¨35 and is valid for five years or the validity of the bearer's passport booklet, whichever is less. From November 2018, Passport Cards are available to Irish Citizens of all ages. Unlike national identity cards issued in other parts of the EU, an Irish passport card cannot be issued unless the bearer already has a valid passport booklet but, because of its convenient size and durable format compared to the Irish passport booklet, it will also serve purposes similar to that of national identity cards in other parts of the EU: identity and age verification, and intra-EU travel. Although they can be used at electronic passport control gates at Dublin Airport, it was not possible, in 2018, to use this card at many electronic border gates/e-gates in Europe. =Security features= Irish passport cards have security features designed to make them difficult to forge or be mistaken as forgeries. They have also been optimised for machine reading. The top-left corner of the passport card contains the biometric chip, which contains a copy of the information printed on the card, and a facial scan of the holder. To prevent unauthorised parties remotely accessing the information stored in the RFID biometric chip, the machine readable zone of the identity page must be scanned to unlock it. This safeguard is known as Basic Access Control. The designation of the document \\"/Ireland/\\" \\"/Passport/\\" is printed in colour-changing ink, which varies from light green to gold-red, depending on the angle of the light shining on it. The background for the front of the passport card is a complex Celtic design, with the words for Ireland appearing in the official languages of the EU as part of the design. The identity picture is greyscale, and is digitally printed onto the surface of the special security polycarbonate. The Irish harp is superimposed as a hologram onto the bottom right corner of the photograph. A likeness of the applicant in a hologram photo on a strip on the back:. According to Charlie Flanagan, the then Foreign Affairs Minister, this is the first time such a security feature was going to be use on travel documents. Ireland's passport card was joint winner of the Best Regional ID Document at the High Security Printing Europe Conference in Bucharest, Romania in March 2016. Northern Ireland Map of most commonly held passport in Northern Ireland. Irish passports may only be issued to individuals holding Irish citizenship. Irish nationality law is extended to include Northern Ireland. Visa free travel Visa requirements for Irish citizens Visa requirements for Irish citizens are travel restrictions placed upon citizens of Ireland by the authorities of other states. As of 3 October 2018, Irish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Irish passport 5th worldwide (tied with the Belgian, Canadian and Swiss passports) according to the Visa Restrictions Index. Notable cases of purported fraudulent use An Irish passport, legitimate or fraudulent, is viewed by many ‚Äì including intelligence services and journalists ‚Äì as a highly valuable and 'safe' document due to Ireland's policy of neutrality. *Oliver North (using the name \\"John Clancy\\") a United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel and a central figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, carried a false Irish passport while visiting Iran in 1986, as did his fellow covert operatives. This was part of a series of events that became known as the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. * In December 2005, Ireland's Minister for Justice Michael McDowell accused journalist Frank Connolly of having travelled to Colombia in 2001 on a falsely obtained Irish passport in connection with the group known as the Colombia Three. Connolly, who worked at the Centre for Public Inquiry, (intended as a public watch-dog organisation), vigorously denied the allegation and in turn accused the Minister of abusing his position. * On 19 January 2010, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas military commander, was assassinated in Dubai by a team involving at least 11 Israeli individuals, three of whom were initially reported as using counterfeit Irish passports. The number of forged Irish passports used in the killing was later revised upwards to eight following a Garda and Department of Foreign Affairs investigation. The Irish government responded by expelling a staff member of the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. It stated it considered \\"an Israeli government agency was responsible for the misuse and, most likely, the manufacture of the forged Irish passports associated with the murder of Mr. Mabhouh.\\" * In June 2010 it was alleged that one of ten covert sleeper agents of the Russian government under non-official cover in the United States as part of the \\"Illegals Program\\" used a forged Irish passport issued in the name of \\"Eunan Gerard Doherty\\" to \\"Richard Murphy.\\" The Russian embassy in Dublin reportedly declined to comment on the allegations that its officials had used a counterfeit Irish passport. \\"Richard Murphy,\\" who later identified himself as Russian national Vladimir Guryev, was repatriated to Russia, along with the other nine members of the Illegals Program, as part of a prisoner exchange. It later emerged that the passports of up to six Irish citizens may have been compromised by the Russian agents. This led to the expulsion of a Dublin-based Russian diplomat in February 2011. Eligibility for an Irish passport All Irish citizens have the constitutional right to hold a passport, although the Irish state may limit this right for purposes of national security. Irish courts also have the power to confiscate passports of defendants. Adult passport booklets are generally valid for 10 years and child passport booklets valid for 5 years. The validity of passport booklets can be limited by the Passport Office for certain individuals, especially those who have lost two or more passports. Passport cards are valid for 5 years or the validity of the corresponding passport booklet, whichever is the lesser period. There was a surge in applications for Irish passports following the UK's Brexit referendum, breaking previous records with over 700,000 passports issued by the end of November 2016.

The intelligence center of the joint force headquarters. The joint intelligence center is responsible for providing and producing the intelligence required to support the joint force commander and staff, components, task forces and elements, and the national intelligence community. There are Joint Intelligence Centers in the United States Central Command at Tampa, Florida, the United States Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii, and in Europe. The Joint Analysis Center serves as a JIC for the United States European Command. History The United States declared war in 1941 with two separate organizations gathering and distributing intelligence for operational planning. The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had been formed in 1882; while the Army's Military Information Division had been established in 1885, and reorganized in 1917 as the Military Intelligence Division (MID). Although the Commandant of the Marine Corps proposed a joint effort in March 1942 interservice rivalry prevented formation of a Joint Intelligence Agency (JIA). In preparation for the Guadalcanal Campaign the Navy established an intelligence center at Pearl Harbor in July 1942. Consolidated intelligence collection began as US forces went on the offensive in 1943 and 1944. Formation of Joint Intelligence Collection Agencies (JICA) began in August 1943. North Africa (JICANA) later became Mediterranean (JICAMED). Africa- Middle East was (JICAME). China-India-Burma (JICACIB) later split into China (JICAC) and India-Burma. JICAs transmitted information to the Joint Intelligence Agency Reception Center (JIARC) in Washington DC where a Joint Electronic Information Agency (JEIA) utilized coded radio transmissions to reduce dissemination time for important intelligence from 60 days to 16 hours. Some theatre commanders resisted coordinated efforts, and General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) never formed a joint intelligence operation. In September 1943 the first designated JIC was Admiral Chester W. Nimitz's Pacific Ocean Areas JIC (JICPOA). JICPOA integrated the staff and independent intelligence distribution system of the Navy's earlier Pearl Harbor intelligence center and was the largest independent theatre intelligence operation. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force JIC (SHAEFJIC) was formed in July 1944 following the Normandy landings. By that time JICPOA was coordinating production and distribution of psychological warfare propaganda leaflets to encourage surrender of Japanese soldiers in isolated island garrisons. Demobilization caused abandonment of the JIC system as the individual services sought to retain independent staffing. The JICAs were deactivated between August and December 1945, and JICPOA was disbanded in October 1945. US European theatre intelligence operations were refocused as the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) created in June 1945 for Operation Paperclip to identify and transport German and Austrian scientists to the United States. Military disinterest in joint United States Department of Defense (DOD) intelligence operations encouraged creation of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1947. Although the DIA was formed in 1961, reestablishment of JICs required elimination of the Army Intelligence Agency (AIA) by the Defense Intelligence Reorganization Act on 10 April 1992 to prosecute the Gulf War in conformance with the Goldwater‚ÄìNichols Act of 1986.

Description The ntpd program is an operating- system daemon that sets and maintains a computer system's system time in synchronization with Internet-standard time servers. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but retains compatibility with versions 1, 2, and 3 as defined by RFC 1059, RFC 1119, and RFC 1305, respectively. ntpd performs most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and uses 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. While ordinary workstations and networks cannot achieve the ultimate precision , future processors and networks may require it. xntpd is the Network Time Protocol version three (1992) daemon software. The \\"x\\" was added to the name because the branch of code that eventually became NTPv3 was \\"experimental\\". The name of the software changed back to \\"ntpd\\" for version four because the inventor of NTP, Dave Mills, decided that something probably should not remain \\"experimental\\" for about twenty years in the absence of dramatic change. ntpd uses a single configuration-file to run the daemon in server and/or client modes. The configuration file, usually named ntp.conf, is located in the /etc directory. Other important files include the drift file, which ntpd uses to correct for hardware-clock skew in the absence of a connection to a more accurate upstream time-server.

The total length of the river is approximately six miles and is very popular with salmon and sea trout anglers, trying to catch one of these migratory fish going up to Loch Lomond. The Vale of Leven is a collection of communities in the northern part of the river, whilst the town of Dumbarton sits at the southern end. Dumbarton Castle sits at the confluence of the river with the Clyde. The Leven is a relatively short river but is widely claimed to be the second fastest flowing river in Scotland, after the River Spey.A plaque beside the river in Balloch makes this claim. The river is crossed by nine bridges and two weirs. There is a path for pedestrians and cyclists near the river, which connects with a cycle path to Glasgow. It follows the river very closely from Balloch to Renton, less closely from Renton to Dumbarton. The river includes two large meander bends, at Cordale and Dalquhurn. In the past the river was used to get steamers into Loch Lomond, although they sometimes did not find it an easy journey and could have difficulty getting past the bridges.The Old Vale and its Memories Nowadays the river is considered to be not navigable. The height of the river can vary, sometimes being a good deal higher in winter than summer.

While the rite is active, unmarried women are not allowed to have sexual relations and must wear a traditional set of tassels. The tassels are usually made of wool and are worn around the neck like a scarf. Girls aged 18 and under must wear blue-and-yellow tassels and are not allowed any physical contact with males. Those aged 19 or over must wear red-and-black tassels and are allowed some physical contact with males but not sexual intercourse. Those that are caught going against umchwasho are fined one animal (typically a cow).King comes courting 20,000 virgin dancers, guardian.co.uk, 2005 The most recent period of umchwasho ran between 9 September 2001 and 19 August 2005. King Mswati III imposed the ban in an effort to help stop the spread of HIV and AIDS, which is particularly prevalent in the country. It was originally intended to last five years but was withdrawn one year early without any stated reason, though the ban had faced strong opposition and many women refused to wear the required woollen scarf. The King also drew criticism when he married a teen during the period, fining himself one cow for breaking the rules. When the rite ended, the tassels were burnt in a large ceremony.

It advised Ministers on the development of NHS policy and was responsible for the effective management of the NHS. The Executive ceased to exist on 1 April 2002 when 4 Regional Directorates of Health and Social Care were established and the central functions were reabsorbed into the Department of Health. The Regional Directorates were abolished in 2003. The functions of the NHS Executive were provided through the Headquarters (mainly in Leeds and London) and eight regional offices which replaced the former regional health authorities. The Information Management Group (IMG) was part of the NHS Executive made up jointly of civil servants and NHS staff. The IMG formed part of the Human and Corporate Resources Directorate, represented on the NHS Executive Board by Ken Jarrold. Their aim was to improve the ability of the NHS to harness and benefit from the management of information and the use of information technology. One of their key objectives was to promote and implement the NHS Executive's national Information Management and Technology (IM&T;) Strategy. The IMG worked with other parts of the NHS Executive and the wider Department of Health to identify and secure the information technology implications of national policy initiatives.

Early life Ancaster was born in London on 29 July 1867. He was the eldest son of Gilbert Henry Heathcote-Drummond- Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster, and Lady Evelyn Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly. He was educated at Lambrook preparatory school and at Eton, where he was editor of the Eton College Chronicle and president of the Eton Society. He then attended Trinity College, Cambridge. Career In 1894, he was elected to Parliament for the Horncastle Division of Lincolnshire, a seat he held until shortly after the December 1910 general election, when he succeeded his father as second Earl of Ancaster and entered the House of Lords. Ancaster later held office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries under David Lloyd George from 1921 to 1922 and under Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin from 1922 to 1924. Apart from his parliamentary political career he was also Lord Lieutenant of Rutland from 1921 to 1951, Chairman of Rutland County Council from 1922 to 1937, DL for the county of Perthshire and JP for Lincolnshire, where he was Chairman of the Kesteven Quarter Sessions from 1911 to 1937. He was Joint Lord Great Chamberlain between 1910 and 1951. He was appointed GCVO in 1937. During the Second Boer War he was appointed an honorary Major of the Leicestershire Imperial Yeomanry, but was in June 1901 transferred to become Captain of the Lincolnshire Imperial Yeomanry, rising to Lieutenant-Colonel. On 12 December 1902 he was one of the founding directors of Ivel Agricultural Motors Limited of Biggleswade, founded by Dan Albone who had invented the Ivel Agricultural Motor (the word 'tractor' did not come into common use until later).

It is sited on the Eastern bank of the River Leven, on the opposite bank from the larger town of Alexandria. History The area is mentioned in a charter of 1225 giving the monks from Paisley Abbey fishing rights on the east bank of the River Leven at the Linbrane pool. Bonhill Parish was noted in a charter of 1270 as \\"the parish of Buthehille\\", and the name became Bonyle about 1550, with the variants Binnuill, Bonuil and Bonill appearing before Bonhill was adopted by 1700. In 1650 this small poor parish was enlarged, and since then the Parish has included most of the towns and villages in the Vale of Leven. The village of Bonhill itself featured an early church, and a ford across the River Leven on the drovers' road to Glasgow. The first modern church was built close to the river in 1747, and it was replaced in 1835 by the present Church of Scotland building on the site of an earlier small church. Various churches of other denominations were constructed from 1830, but closed in the 1960s. The textile finishing industry came to Bonhill with a printworks, the Dalmonach Works which started in 1786. It burnt down in 1812, and was rebuilt by Henry Bell. A second textile works opened in 1793, and two more works had begun by 1840. Some closed shortly afterwards, but one lasted to 1936. The Dalmonach Works itself featured a school outside the main gates, serving children from the area as well as children employed in the works. After the works closed in 1929, its buildings were used an army barracks during World War II, and subsequently occupied by various smaller companies before the buildings were demolished in 2006, leaving only the school which remains as a listed building. The town rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s when many residents of Glasgow were moved to \\"New Bonhill\\" built on green field sites aimed at facilitating economic expansion and assisting with the removal of below- standard Glasgow housing. This process was known as the \\"Glasgow overspill\\". The new houses were built by Dumbarton District Council and the now defunct Scottish Special Housing Association (SSHA). Many think that the scale of the new estates was too large and monolithic in terms of tenure. Originally fairly prosperous (SSHA provided houses for workers in order to assist the economy), the industrial decline that hit the Alexandria area hard led to high levels of unemployment and the social ills that often follow that. The new Bonhill estates were built quite high up on the hill providing magnificent views up the valley to Loch Lomond. Amenities were planned and built, schools, library, shops, a pub, take away etc. Bus routes were introduced but the houses felt remote from Alexandria centre (a town lacking basic amenities itself). The Council housing was provided with a district heating system using a single power plant. The system had a set charge collected with rent rather than being metered the aim being to ensure nobody suffered from fuel poverty. Unfortunately this was very badly engineered, used poor material and suffered from vast leakages. The system became uneconomic because of the many breakdowns and the communal plant was removed and individual gas boilers installed. The New Bonhill estates suffered from vandalism, however demolition of the tenement flats and the introduction of mixed tenure has mitigated this somewhat. The largest employers for Bonhill residents are Faslane/Coulport submarine bases and West Dunbartonshire Council. Bonhill and the wider West Dumbartonshire area is essentially now commuter belt for Glasgow. The nearest town is Dumbarton, . According to the 2011 census, Bonhill's population has declined slightly to 9,360 Notes Category:Towns in West Dunbartonshire ","title":"Bonhill"},{"id":"2489371","text":"The Joint Intelligence Operations Center Europe (JIOCEUR) Analytic Center (JAC), formerly known as the Joint Analysis Center, is a Joint Intelligence Center serving as a military intelligence analysis centre for the United States European Command located at RAF Molesworth, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom and managed by the Defense Intelligence Agency.

It is close to Kolkata and also a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). BSNL Telephone Exchange, Panihati History There is a legendary belief that Maharaja Chandraketu of Deganga established a garh (fort) at Panihati in the 13th century. There is an association of goddess Bhawani with the fort. In the early days when river transport was the primary means of communication, Panihati was a major trading and business centre, then known as Pannyahati (Emporium for Merchandise). Scholars feel that the name has come from the word Pannyahatic. Panihati is mentioned in several Vaishnava Padavali literary texts ‚Äì Chaitanya Mangal Kavya by Jayananda and Lochandas in the 16th century, Sri Chaitanya Bhagawat by Brindaban Das in 1548, Bansi Bistar by Nityannda, Vaishnava Namdeva by Debaki Nandan, Sri Chaitanya Charitamritam by Krishnadas Kabiraj in 1580‚Äì1610, Bhakti Ratnakar and Chaitanya Chandroday. Panihati Municipality was established in 1900. This place is said to be visited by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on his way to Puri & later by his close associate Nityananda too, due to which Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider this place holy.

A few of them made their own arrangements, but \\"it was squatters who made the East Bengali refugees famous or infamous.\\" Squatting (jabardakhal in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. \\"This happened as early as 1948 with middle class refugees in the Jadavpur area: first on government land and then on private property, leading to violent clashes. Having won the battle, the elated squatters named their colony ‚ÄòBijaygarh‚Äô, the Fort of Victory.\\" By 1949, there were 40 such colonies in Jadavpur, Kasba, Santoshpur, Garia and Behala, in the south-eastern part of the city, and 65 in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone in the north. Subsequently squatters colonies also came up along the west bank of the Hooghly and by 1950, there were 150 such colonies. It has to be borne in mind that the squatters were in a way ‚Äúself-settlers‚Äù in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government/ administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.Chatterjee, Nilanjana, \\"The East Bengal Refugees: A Lesson in Survival\\", in \\"Calcutta, The Living City\\" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 72-75, First published 1990, 2005 edition, Efforts have been made in more recent years to regularise land/property rights in the refugee colonies.

The song criticizes liberal hypocrisy. (Lehrer: \\"It's fun to eulogize the people you despise, as long as you don't let 'em in your school.\\") * \\"MLF Lullaby\\" ‚Äì An ultimately failed U.S. proposal for a multilateral nuclear force as part of NATO * \\"George Murphy\\" ‚Äì George Murphy, dancer, actor, U.S. Senator from California, and Robert F. Kennedy (D, NY), the putative third senator from Massachusetts. Democratic voters of the time questioned whether an actor with no political experience could function as a Senator. (Lehrer: \\"Oh, gee, it's great: at last we've got a Senator who can really sing and dance!\\") * \\"The Folk Song Army\\" ‚Äì Topical songs as part of the folk revival of the 1960s; also alludes to songs of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, especially \\"Venga Jaleo\\" which it excerpts musically (Lehrer: \\"Remember the war against Franco / That's the kind where each of us belongs / Though he may have won all the battles / We had all the good songs\\") * \\"Smut\\" ‚Äì Censorship of obscenity, and the 1957 U.S. Supreme Court case Roth v. United States, which coined the expression \\"redeeming social importance\\" (Lehrer: \\"Give me smut and nothing but / A dirty novel I can't shut / If it's uncut / And unsubt...tle\\") * \\"Send the Marines\\" ‚Äì The history and habit of using the United States Marine Corps to intervene in other, usually weaker, countries, the latest example being the most recent U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic in April 1965. (In 2003, former chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix told a Swedish radio program that he did not think that the Invasion of Iraq, \\"in the way it was justified, was compatible with the UN Charter,\\" and then had the station play this very song.) * \\"Pollution\\" ‚Äì Environmental pollution (Lehrer: \\"Turn on your tap / And get hot and cold running crud.\\") ;Side two * \\"So Long, Mom (A Song for World War III)\\" ‚Äì Nuclear war, Mutually Assured Destruction, nostalgia over past wars, and television news coverage. (Lehrer: \\"I feel that, if there's going to be any songs coming out of World War III, we'd better start writing them NOW.\\") In this, he references a 1904 George M. Cohan song and show, Little Johnny Jones. * \\"Whatever Became of Hubert?\\" ‚Äì Hubert Humphrey, then U.S. Vice President under Lyndon B. Johnson. The song underscores the idea that going from any office to that of Vice President was actually a step down, because of traditional restrictions imposed by the President. (Lehrer: \\"Second fiddle's a hard part, I know / When they don't even give you a bow.\\") * \\"New Math\\" ‚Äì New Math, a trend at the time in the teaching of mathematics. Like today's Common Core Math, the New Math of that time often baffled even the experts. (Lehrer: \\"In the new approach, as you know, the idea is to understand what you're doing, rather than to get the right answer!\\" * \\"Alma\\" ‚Äì Alma Mahler, who had recently died. Composer and painter; wife, successively, of Gustav Mahler, Walter Gropius, and Franz Werfel. (Lehrer: \\"It's people like that who make you realize how little you've accomplished. It's a sobering thought, for example, that, when Mozart was my age, he had been dead for two years.\\" Lehrer was 37 at the time of this recording; Mozart died at the age of 35.) * \\"Who's Next?\\" ‚Äì Nuclear proliferation An example of one of Lehrer's favorite styles, the List Song, it rattles off numerous places that might get The Bomb, including a U.S. state (\\"We'll try to stay serene and calm / When Alabama gets the bomb!\\") In later years, Lehrer replaced \\"Alabama\\" with \\"Neiman-Marcus.\\" * \\"Wernher Von Braun\\" ‚Äì Before heading up the U.S. rocket development program during the 1960s Space Race with the Soviet Union, German- American rocket scientist Wernher von Braun had helped develop the infamous V-2 rocket for Nazi Germany. Hence the verse: \\"Once the rockets are up / Who cares where they come down? / That's not my department / Says Wernher Von Braun\\". (Said Lehrer: \\"And what will make it possible to spend $20 billion of your money to put some clown on the moon? Why, it's good ol' American know- how, that's what! Led by good ol' Americans like Dr. Wernher Von Braun.\\") Contrary to popular belief, von Braun did not sue Tom Lehrer for defamation, nor has Lehrer been forced to relinquish all of his royalty income to Von Braun.

The face of a snarling feline decorates the side of the vessel chamber, directly under the whistle spout. Bottle, Feline Face, 4th‚Äì3rd century BCE Metropolitan Museum of Art The Paracas culture was an Andean society existing between approximately 800 BCE and 100 BCE, with an extensive knowledge of irrigation and water management and that made significant contributions in the textile arts. It was located in what today is the Ica Region of Peru. Most information about the lives of the Paracas people comes from excavations at the large seaside Paracas site on the Paracas Peninsula, first formally investigated in the 1920s by Peruvian archaeologist Julio Tello. The Paracas Cavernas are shaft tombs set into the top of Cerro Colorado, each containing multiple burials. There is evidence that over the centuries when the culture thrived, these tombs were reused. In some cases, the heads of the deceased were taken out, apparently for rituals, and later reburied. The associated ceramics include incised polychrome, \\"negative\\" resist decoration, and other wares of the Paracas tradition. The associated textiles include many complex weave structures, as well as elaborate plaiting and knotting techniques. The necropolis of Wari Kayan consisted of two clusters of hundreds of burials set closely together inside and around abandoned buildings on the steep north slope of Cerro Colorado. The associated ceramics are very fine plain wares, some with white and red slips, others with pattern-burnished decoration, and other wares of the Topara tradition. Each burial consisted of a conical textile-wrapped bundle, most containing a seated individual facing north across the bay of Paracas, next to grave offerings such as ceramics, foodstuffs, baskets, and weapons. Each body was bound with cord to hold it in a seated position, before being wrapped in many layers of intricate, ornate, and finely woven textiles. The Paracas Necropolis textiles and embroideries are considered to be some of the finest ever produced by Pre-Columbian Andean societies. They are the primary works of art by which Paracas culture is known. Burials at the necropolis of Wari Kayan continued until approximately 250 CE. Many of the mortuary bundles include textiles similar to those of the early Nazca culture, which arose after the Paracas.  Paracas mummy bundles  The dry environment of southern Peru's Pacific coast allows organic materials to be preserved when buried. Mummified human remains were found in a tomb in the Paracas peninsula of Peru, buried under layers of cloth textiles. The dead were wrapped in layers of cloth called \\"mummy bundles\\". These bodies were found at the Great Paracas Necropolis along the south Pacific coast of the Andes. At the Necropolis there was a large communal tomb holding 420 bodies, dating to around 300‚Äì200 BCE. The mummified bodies in the tomb were wrapped in textile fragments. The textiles would have required many hours of work as each textile was extremely detailed. The larger mummy bundles had elaborate embroidery detail with bright colored cloth. Jewelry and food were also found inside some mummy bundles. The shape of the mummy bundles resembled seeds. According to Anne Paul, this shape could have been a conscious choice by the people, with the seed a symbol of rebirth. Paul also suggests that the detail and high quality of the textiles found in the mummy bundles show that these fabrics were used for important ceremonial purposes. The technique used for these textiles, called wrap and wrapping, involves a piece of colored fleece woven around pieces of cotton wrap threads before the weaving process. The colored fleece was dyed before the weaving process and mixed with the white cotton. This combination of materials shows trading relationships with other communities at lower and higher elevations. The wool came from camelids in the highlands (llama and alpaca); the cotton was grown in the warmer coastal valley. The imagery found on these textiles included ceremonial practices and spiritual journeys. Some depicted a fallen figure, or possibly flying. Each figure appears to have face paint, possibly indicating different city states. Each holds a severed head, also called trophy heads. Victims' heads were often severed and collected during battles. The heads were used for spiritual rituals. The head of a person was considered their life force, the place in the body where the spirit was located. It is believed the fallen or flying figure represents a spiritual journey, perhaps showing a ruler priest on a spiritual journey or undergoing a type of spiritual transformation from the celestial world back to the terrestrial. Not only did these textiles show important symbols of the Paracas cosmology, it is thought that they were worn to establish social standing, authority, and indicate the Paracas city state in which one resided. These garments were brightly colored, with a palette of pinks, greens, yellows, red, purples, and whites, all of which would have been striking against the beige desert sands of the surrounding environment. The bright colors are another example of the extensive labor used to create these textiles. The dyes used came from across the Andes and are an example of reciprocity, as people from different altitudes traded with one another for different goods. The color red comes from the cochineal bug found on the prickly pear cactus. The cochineal was ground up with mortar and pestle to create a red pigment. Yellow dyes could be made from the qolle tree and quico flowers, while orange dyes can be extracted from a type of moss called beard lichen. For the color green the most common plant used is the cg'illca, mixed with a mineral called collpa. While blues are created from a tara, the deeper a hue of blue, the more the mineral collpa was added. The process of creating dyes could take up to several hours. Then it could take another two hours for women to boil and dye the fibers. This work was followed by spinning and weaving the fibers. The textiles and jewelry in the tombs and mummy bundles attracted looters. Once discovered, the Paracas Necropolis was looted heavily between the years 1931 and 1933, during the Great Depression, particularly in the Wari Kayan section. The amount of stolen materials is not known; however, Paracas textiles began to appear on the international market in the following years. It is believed the majority of Paracas textiles outside of the Andes were smuggled out of Peru. Due to a lack of laws to preserve artifacts and against smuggling, thefts continued to increase, particularly of South American artifacts. In 1970 UNESCO created the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Turban, Paracas, 300 BCE ‚Äì 100 CE Brooklyn Museum Topara While the Paracas culture developed in this region between approximately 1200 BCE and 100 BCE, the Topar√° culture is thought to have \\"invaded\\" from the north at approximately 150 BCE. The two cultures coexisted for one or more generations, both on the Paracas Peninsula and in the nearby Ica Valley. Their interaction played a key role in the development of the Nazca culture and its ceramic and textile traditions. Although the elaborate textiles have been preserved only in the coastal desert sites, there is growing evidence that the associated peoples of these cultures lived and traveled as well among the Pacific lowlands, the Andean highland valleys, and mountain pastures to the east.

The Entire textile can be viewed at Metropolitan Museum website  Nazca culture  Nazca Culture and iconography are believed by scholars such as Helaine Silverman to have evolved from Paracas culture. Hendrik Van Gijseghem notes that Paracas remains in the R√≠o Grande de Nazca drainage, the heartland of Nazca culture, are limited. He said that, in contrast, there are abundant Paracas remains in the Ica, Pisco, and Chincha valleys, as well as the Bah√≠a de la Independencia. He noted that the southern Nasca region, which became the most populous region of its culture, was never an important area of Paracas occupation. He believes that initial settlement of the region by Paracas populations and subsequent population growth mark the beginning of Nazca society.  Paracas geoglyphs  In 2018 RPAS drones used by archaeologists to survey cultural evidence revealed many geoglyphs in Palpa province. These are being assigned to the Paracas culture. Many have been shown to predate the associated Nasca lines by a thousand years. In addition, some show a significant difference in subjects and locations, for instance, being constructed on a hillside rather than the desert valley floor.Greshko, Michael, \\"Exclusive: Massive Ancient Drawings Found in Peruvian Desert\\", National Geographic, 05 April 2018 Additional research is being conducted on these geoglyphs.

One record-breaking specimen of Paradoxides davidis, described by John William Salter in !863, SALTER, J. W. 1863. On the Discovery of Paradoxides in Britain. Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, London, 19, 274‚Äì277. is . The cephalon was semicircular with free cheeks ending in long, narrow, recurved spines. Eyes were crescent shaped providing an almost 360¬∞ view, but only in the horizontal plane. Its elongate thorax was composed of 19-21 segments and adorned with longish, recurved pleurall spines. Its pygidium was comparatively small. Paradoxides is a characteristic Middle-Cambrian trilobite of the 'Atlantic' (Avalonian) fauna. Avalonian rocks were deposited near a small continent called Avalonia in the Paleozoic Iapetus Ocean. Avalonian beds are now in a narrow strip along the East Coast of North America, and in Europe.  Description  The exoskeleton of Paradoxides is large to very large, relatively flat, and about one and a half times longer than wide, with greatest width across the genal spines. The cephalon is close to semicircular with long genal spines developed from the posterlateral corners of the cephalon. Depending on species the facial sutures are of variable length behind the palpebral lobes. The preoccular sections of the facial suture follows a slight S-curve and intersect the anterior cephalic margin in front of the eye. Four pairs of Glabellar furrowows are usually present, the posterior two pairs (1p and 2p) are transglabellar. 3p and 4p furrows short with 4p commonly directed forwads and outwards to intercect axial furrows oposite maximum galabellar width. Palpebral lobes are short and of variable length. Hypostoma in some species is fused with the rostral plate, e.g. in Paradoxides davidis Salter (1863, op. cit.), a character that distinguishes the genus from all other trilobites, except in some Cambrian Corynexochida such as Oryctocephalus and Fieldaspis. Thorax consists of 19-21 segments; axis about as wide as each of the pleurae, excluding pleural spines which curve backwards and slightly increase in length towards posterior. Spines on rear thoracic segment twice as long, oftem more, than associated pleurae and extending well beyond the pygidium. Pygidium is small with one or two axial rings and may be partially or completely fused to the last thoracic segment. The axis does not reach the rear margin of the pygidium and defines a U-shaped pleural field.  Ontogeny  Paradoxides gracilis, lacking the free cheeks and with the spines on the most backward thoracic segment broken off The larval development (or ontogeny) of Paradoxides was already described by Barrande (in 1852). The earliest stage (protaspis) is a disc with three pairs of spines on the margin. Genal spines are placed at half-length and directed at about 45¬∞ outward and backward, curving slightly further backwards and almost a third of the diameter of the protaspis long. Sharply pointed intergenal spines, about 50% of the disc diameter long, are positioned at the back of the future cephalon, are straight and pointing backwards and 15¬∞ outward. These spines will have disappeared in adult specimens. The first of future thoracic spines are placed immediately next to the intergenal spines and curve to a parallel with the midline. The front of the glabella almost reaches the front and consists of four sets of lobes divided by a furrow on the midline in the frontal two-thirds, and furrows between them. The most backward set consisting of two central and two lateral lobes. Further backwards is the final element of the glabella, one central occipital lobe that carries a small node, and two lateral occipital lobes. The axis is terminated with three rings of somewhat decreasing width. Midlength of the side of the most glabellar lobes run semicircular eyelobes parallel to the margin of the exoskeleton, ending near the base of the intergenal spine  Behaviour  This P. paradoxissimus specimen at the Copenhagen Zoological Museum was described by Carl Linnaeus Like in many early trilobites, the thorax of Paradoxides consists of so-called nonfulcrate segments, that allow the animal to roll, providing protection from front, rear, top, and bottom, while leaving access to the soft ventral side of the animal from each of the sides. Complete specimens of Paradoxides have been found with the librigenae and fused rostral-hypostomal plate. In moulting, the body was arched above the substrate, with the anterior border at the front and posterior pleural spines dug into sediment. Stretching the body would then result in rupturing the sutures in the cephalon and flipping off the librigenae including the rostral-hypostomal plate. After moulting the animal would exit moving forward from its old exoskeleton. Specimens of Paradoxides have been found containing intact Peronopsis trilobites between glabella and hypostome and where the gut would have been, and these are assumed to have not been food items of the large trilobite, but instead either scavenged on its digestive track, or found shelter.  Reassigned species  A number of species previously assigned to the genus Paradoxides have since been transferred to other genera: * P. armatus = Metadoxides armatus * P. boltoni = Arctinurus boltoni * P. carolinaensis = Pteridinium * P. expectans = Luhops expectans * P. harlani = Acadoparadoxides harlani * P. kjerulfi = Holmia kjerulfi * P. loveni = Centropleura loveni * P. nevadensis = Olenoides nevadensis * P. oelandicus = Acadoparadoxides oelandicus * P. pusillus = Phanoptes pusillus * P. rotundatus = Hydrocephalus rotundatus * P. sacheri = Acadoparadoxides sacheri * P. torosus = Metadoxides torosus  Distribution  Fossils of Paradoxides have been found in Canada (New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador), Colombia (Duda Formation, El Dorado, Meta),TORO TORO et al., 2014 the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Morocco, Norway, Poland, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Alaska, Massachusetts, South Carolina).Paradoxides at Fossilworks.org  References  Bibliography = * Category:Paradoxidoidea Category:Cambrian trilobites Category:Cambrian Africa Category:Cambrian trilobites of Europe Category:Cambrian trilobites of North America Category:Cambrian Canada Category:Cambrian United States Category:Cambrian South America Category:Paleozoic Colombia Category:Fossils of Colombia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1822 Category:Paleozoic life of New Brunswick Category:Paleozoic life of Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Paradoxides"},{"id":"2489441","text":"The praetorian prefecture of Illyricum (; , also termed simply the Prefecture of Illyricum) was one of four praetorian prefectures into which the Late Roman Empire was divided. The administrative centre of the prefecture was Sirmium (375-379), and, after 379, Thessalonica.Thessalonica, 1910 Catholic EncyclopediaIllyria, 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia It took its name from the older province of Illyricum, which in turn was named after ancient Illyria, and in its greatest expanse encompassed Pannonia, Noricum, Crete, and most of the Balkan peninsula except for Thrace. Administrative history Unlike the other three \\"classical\\" prefectures that are mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum (Gaul, the Italy-Africa and the East), the early administrative history of Illyricum as a prefecture during the 4th century involved its abolition, re-establishment and division several times.It is a common mistake that the praetorian prefectures were established as territorial units by Constantine I already around 318 or 324, as anachronistically claimed by Zosimus. In reality, each Augustus or Caesar continued to have his own praetorian prefect as his chief of staff, and only by the mid-4th century did the prefectures become permanent administrative subdivisions of the Empire. Morrison (2007), pp. 190‚Äì191 Initially the territories comprising the later praetorian prefecture of Illyricum belonged to the Prefecture of Italy, Illyricum and Africa. It was as established as a praetorian prefecture in its own right during the dynastic struggles between the sons of Constantine the Great which followed his death in 337.Barnes, T. D., The New Empire of Diocletian and Constantine, p. 139 It seems that the three dioceses of Macedonia, Dacia and Pannonia were first grouped together in a separate praetorian prefecture in 347 by Constans by removing them from the praetorian prefecture of Italy, Africa and Illyricum (which then became the praetorian prefecture of Italy and Africa) or that this praetorian prefecture was formed in 343 when Constans appointed a prefect for Italy.Barnes, T. D., Constantine: Dynasty, Religion and Power in the Later Roman Empire, p. 160, 2011 It remained in existence until 361, when it was abolished by emperor Julian, and then revived under Gratian between 375-379.Morrison (2007), p. 396 In that year the Diocese of Pannonia (Illyricum occidentale, \\"Western Illyricum\\") was again added to Italy as the \\"Diocese of Illyricum\\", while Macedonia and Dacia (Illyricum orientale, \\"Eastern Illyricum\\") were briefly ruled directly by Theodosius I from Thessalonica.Greece, 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia During the years 384-395 they were again incorporated in the Italian prefecture, except a short period in 388-391, when the two dioceses formed a separate prefecture. Praetorian Prefectures of the Roman Empire (375-379) Only after the death of Theodosius in 395 and the division of the Empire did the Illyricum assume the permanent form which appears in the Notitia, incorporating the dioceses of Macedonia and Dacia, with Thessalonica as capital. However, the Western Empire, especially during the regency of Stilicho, continued claim them until 437 when, as part of the dowry of Licinia Eudoxia, Valentinian III recognized the East's sovereignty over the prefecture.Morrison (2007), pp. 397‚Äì398 On this occasion, it appears that the prefecture's capital was to Sirmium (437-441),Southern Pannonia during the age of the Great Migrations but the move is debated, as the northern Balkans were at the time ravaged by invasions. Likewise, the intention of Justinian I to move the capital to his new city of Justiniana Prima in the 540s remained unfulfilled. Morrison (2007), pp. 401‚Äì402 Following the Slavic invasions in the 7th century, most of the Balkan hinterland was lost by the Byzantines, who only retained control of the parts of Thrace nearest Constantinople, Thessalonica and its environs, and some coastal strips in Greece. A praetorian prefect () is attested in the sources as governor of Thessalonica as late as the first years of the 9th century, one of the last survivals of the old Constantinian administrative system in the entire Empire. At that point however, the wars with the rising power of Bulgaria necessitated a reorganization of the provinces, and Thessalonica was constituted as a distinct theme under a strategos sometime before 840.Bury (1912), pp. 223‚Äì224 List of known praefecti praetorio per Illyricum Insignia of the Praetorian Prefect of the Illyricum * Vulcacius Rufinus (347-352) * Quintus Flavius Maesius Egnatius Lollianus Mavortius (355-56) * Anatolius (-360) *Florentius (360) * Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (c.364) * Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius (378-379) * Vettius Agorius Praetextatus (384, also Praetorian Prefect of Italy) * Flavius Eutychianus (396-397) *Anatolius (397-399) *Herculius (408-410) *Leontius (412-413) * Flavius Junius Quartus Palladius (416-421, also Praetorian Prefect of Italy) * Gessius (some time between 421 and 443) * Flavius Anthemius Isidorus (424) *Flavius Simplicius Reginus (435) *Eubulus (436) *Thalassius (439) *Apraeumius (441) *Eulogius (c. 451) *Valentinianus (452) *Callicrates (468-469) * Iohannes (472) *Basilides (529) ReferencesSources     * * Notitia dignitatum External links *Map - The Roman Empire in 337 Illyricum Category:Illyricum (Roman province) Category:Albania in the Roman era Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Roman era Category:Bulgaria in the Roman era Category:Croatia in the Roman era Category:Dalmatia (Roman province) Category:Greece in the Roman era Category:Hungary in the Roman era Category:Macedonia (Roman province) Category:Montenegro in the Roman era Category:Serbia in the Roman era Category:Slovenia in the Roman era Category:Roman Thessalonica Category:Ancient history of Vojvodina Category:Byzantine Serbia Category:Medieval Thessalonica Category:History of Syrmia Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum Category:4th century in the Byzantine Empire Category:5th century in the Byzantine Empire Category:6th century in the Byzantine Empire Category:7th century in the Byzantine Empire Category:347 establishments Category:States and territories disestablished in the 7th century Category:4th-century establishments in the Byzantine Empire Category:7th-century disestablishments in the Byzantine Empire ","title":"Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum"},{"id":"2489443","text":"Wongan Hills is a town in the Shire of Wongan-Ballidu, in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. The town is approximately 182 km north of the state capital Perth, at an altitude of 286 metres. The town is named for a nearby range of hills that are found to the north-west of the town, also named Wongan Hills, which was first recorded in 1836 by Surveyor General of Western Australia John Septimus Roe. As part of Easter celebrations in 2009, a cross was laid out in a bare paddock using 460 half-tonne hay bales with the aid of GPS receivers. The cross was set alight on Good Friday night and was the end of a pilgrimage conducted on Easter Saturday. History The area was settled by the 1900s, and in 1911 the town was gazetted and named after the range. \\"Wongan\\" is derived from the Indigenous Australian name \\"wangan-katta\\", \\"wanka\\" and \\"woongan\\". \\"Katta\\" is known to mean \\"hill\\", but the meaning of \\"wongan\\" is uncertain. It may be related to \\"kwongan\\", an indigenous word for sandplain, or \\"whispering\\", in which case \\"wongan katta\\" would mean \\"whispering hills\\" (katta is a word for hill). In 1925 an agricultural research station was established about 5 km north of the town which assisted in the diversification and improvements in farm practices through the state. The area is a prosperous agricultural region with activities focused on sheep, grain and pig-farming. Construction of a grain silo commenced in 1933 as part of the bulk handling scheme that had been introduced by the government and managed by Cooperative Bulk Handling. In the early 1900s, poet Lilian Wooster Greaves lived with her family at Wongan Hills. Her book of poetry includes a number of prose and poetry items relating to living there at the time of the first world war. Climate Wongan Hills historically had a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Csa) however drying associated with widening of the Hadley cell has shifted the area in recent times to a hot semi-arid climate (BSh).Seidel, Diane J., Qiang Fu, Randell, William J. and Reichler, Thomas J.; ‚ÄòWidening of the tropical belt in a changing climate‚Äô, Nature, (2008), volume 1, pp. 21-24 The climate is similar to Northern Hemisphere areas on the southern Mediterranean Sea like Tripoli or Gaza City, though Wongan Hills‚Äô inland location produces hotter, less arid summers and cooler winters than those localities. Summers are hot to sweltering and generally arid, though occasionally tropical cyclones from the hot Indian Ocean will affect the region after moving inland, whilst winters are comfortable with cold nights and occasional showers.
