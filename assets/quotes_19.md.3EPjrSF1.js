Writing in Hiligaynon, he is a Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature Hall of Fame Awardee, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Literary Grant, and the All-Western Visayas Literary Contest (National Commission for Culture and the Arts) winner. In 2015, he became the first Filipino author to be invited to the Sharjah International Book Fair in the United Arab Emirates. Writing in English, Filipino, and Hiligaynon, he has authored at least 20 books, and has written screenplays. He wrote and edited newspapers in Iloilo City before becoming a nurse in the United States. As an actor, Nery briefly appeared in Tikoy Aguiluz's film on cybersex, www.XXX.com, of which he was also the assistant director. He has also written, produced, and directed a full-length feature film in Hiligaynon, Gugma sa Panahon sang Bakunawa (Love in the Time of the Bakunawa), which was a finalist at the 1st Sineng Pambansa National Film Competition of the Film Development Council of the Philippines. Nery resides in Reisterstown, Maryland, and continues to write in at least three languages. Early life and education Peter Solis Nery was born on January 6, 1969 and raised in the coastal town of Dumangas, Iloilo, Philippines. He is the eldest among five siblings and his parents were both public school teachers. Peter attended primary school at the Dumangas Central Elementary School, completed his secondary education at the Dumangas Polytechnic College (now Iloilo State College of Fisheries), where he was consistently a first honor student from grade school to high school. He finished his bachelor of science degree in Biology from the University of the Philippines in the Visayas, where he was named Most Outstanding Student (1989) and Most Outstanding Graduate of 1990. He also received the President‚Äôs Award of Merit as Outstanding Student in his graduation year. While at school, Peter honed his talent for writing. Under his editorship, he led the UPV College of Arts and Sciences' official publication, Pagbutlak (Sunrise) to become the region‚Äôs best at the 1989 College Press Awards. Peter also had attended the SVD Christ the King Mission Seminary in Quezon City where he took an Associate in Philosophy degree in 1992-1993. In 2004, he earned his Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from the West Negros College (now West Negros University) in Bacolod, Negros Occidental. Writing careerEarly works= After the EDSA Revolution of 1986, Peter found himself in a new wave of Philippine literature. There was a resurgence of interest in nationalistic writing. At U.P., Peter was lucky to meet Leoncio Deriada (2001 Palanca Hall of Fame awardee) who encouraged him to write in Hiligaynon. Peter won his first national award in writing for his poetry in Hiligaynon, Mga Ambahanon kag Pangamuyo sang Bata nga Nalimtan sa Wayang (Songs and Prayers of a Child Forgotten in the Fields)in 1992. For his performance poetry Si Eva, si Delilah, si Ruth, kag ang Alput (Eva, Delilah, Ruth, and the Prostitute) at the Premio Operiano Italia, he was named Hari sang Binalaybay (King of Hiligaynon Poetry) in 1993, a title he held until 1998. During his student activism days at the university, he wrote his first book, I Flew a Kite for Pepe, in 1993. He admits, ‚ÄúI cringe now at my boldness to call it poetry then but I always thought that the book had a big heart. I still cry when I read it.‚Äù It was followed by his earth song and hymn to the planet, First Few Notes of a Green Symphony. =Transition= While working as a religious missionary in Macau, Peter became more introspective and started his memoirs. The Essential Thoughts of a Purple Cat was published by Giraffe Books in 1996; Moon River, Butterflies and Me in 1997; and My Life as a Hermit again by Giraffe in 1998. In 1995, he won the NCCA Western Visayas Poetry Competition for his collection Umanhon nga Gugma (Love of the Rural Folks). Some of the poems were translated, reworked, and included in his provocative collection, Rated R (Giraffe Books, 1997). Peter published four titles in 1997: the playful poetry collection Shy Evocations of Childhood and Other Poems that Came under Hypnosis, and Rated R for Giraffe; Shorts, a collection of haiku- like poems, and the memoir Moon River, Butterflies and Me for New Day. He won his first Palanca gold medal for his magical realist Hiligaynon Short Story Lirio about a deaf-mute who is a victim of marital rape. Furthermore, his first screenplay, Buyong, about a Katipunero revolutionary from Aklan won third prize in the screenplay category of the Centennial Literary Prize. Later that year, his second screenplay, Tayo na sa Buwan (Let‚Äôs Go to the Moon), won an honorable mention at the Film Development Foundation of the Philippines. Eventually, he started his own publishing company and produced A Loneliness Greater than Love (2000), an exploration of homoerotic themes; and Fantasia (2000), a collection of his Palanca-winning fiction. In 2001, he published Rain as Gentle as Tears, a sequel to his 1997 Shorts collection, and The Prince of Ngoyngoy (The Prince of Sob), a collection of lyric poems in Hiligaynon that established Peter as the Ilonggo epitome of emotional poetry. In 2003, he launched Pierre: The Magazine of Peter Solis Nery. It delivered three monthly issues. When opportunity came in 2006, he went to the United States to work as a nurse. For 100 days in 2005, Peter endeavored to write 100 erotic sonnets in Hiligaynon. He called it Kakunyag (Thrill). It was launched during the National Arts Month 2006 in Iloilo, and was serialized in a newspaper. He won a Palanca in 2006 for his Hiligaynon psycho-thriller short story, Ang Kapid (The Twins). The win provided him another encouragement to persevere in writing in the Hiligaynon. In 2007, Peter won his second Palanca gold for his historical Hiligaynon Short Story Candido, about the anting- anting (amulet) of the revolutionary Candido Iban. The following year, he won his third Palanca gold for his play in English, The Passion of Jovita Fuentes, about the tragic love of the first Filipino international opera diva and first female National Artist in Music. Peter also completed translation of his 100 Erotic Sonnets in the Hiligaynon into English in 2008. Nursing career Nery enrolled in Nursing as he continued to write for the newspaper. He graduated his Bachelor of Science in Nursing in October 2004.http://docstoc.com/docs/2819311 He went to the United States in February 2006 and became a Registered Nurse in California in May of the same year and started working as an orthopedic nurse in Los Angeles in 2007. In October 2008, he was given various awards for his commitment to his nursing profession including the Daisy Award for Extraordinary Nurses. Peter Solis Nery Foundation The Peter Solis Nery Foundation, or The Peter Solis Nery Foundation for Hiligaynon Literature and the Arts, Inc. was established in September 2012 by Nery, right after his induction into the Palanca Awards Hall of Fame.Peter Solis Nery The foundation, which aims to promote, preserve, and propagate Hiligaynon literature, and Filipino art and culture, through research, publications, productions, education, and cultural dissemination, was incorporated by the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on November 5, 2012. Following immediately, the foundation created the Peter‚Äôs Prize for Excellence in Hiligaynon Writing that first gave out awards in September 2013. In May 2014, the foundation sponsored a month-long online Hiligaynon poetry workshop called Poem-a-thon with Peter Solis Nery. In August 2014, the foundation published five anthology books of new Hiligaynon writings culled from the Peter‚Äôs Prize competitions and the Poem-a-thon workshop. Personal life Nery is gay, and was married to an American man from 2008 until the latter's death when Nery was 46. Nery is a Roman Catholic despite the church‚Äôs stand on homosexuality.

Paleolithic Throughout the Paleolithic Era, which was between 500,000‚Äì10,000 BC, the primary socio-economic unit was the band (small kin group). Communication between bands occurred for the purposes of trading ideas, stories, tools, foods, animal skins, mates, and other commodities. Economic resources were constrained by typical ecosystem factors: density and replacement rates of edible flora and fauna, competition from other consumers (organisms) and climate. Throughout the Upper Paleolithic, humans both dispersed and adapted to a greater variety of environments, and also developed their technologies and behaviors to increase productivity in existing environments taking the global population to between 1 and 15 million. It has been estimated that throughout prehistory, the world average GDP per capita was about $158 per annum (adjusted to 2013 dollars), and did not rise much until the Industrial Revolution.http://delong.typepad.com/print/20061012_LRWGDP.pdf Mesolithic This period began with the end of the last glacial period over 10,000 years ago involving the gradual domestication of plants and animals and the formation of settled communities at various times and places. Neolithic Within each tribe the activity of individuals was differentiated to specific activities, and the characteristic of some of these activities were limited by the resources naturally present and available from within each tribe's territory, creating specializations of skill. By the \\"... division of labour and evolution of new crafts ...\\" (Cameron p. 25) \\"tribal units became naturally isolated through time from the over-all developments in skill and technique present within their neighbouring environment. To utilize artifacts made by tribes specializing in areas of production not present to other tribes, exchange and trade became necessary.\\"Rondo Cameron Concise Economic History of the World: From Paleolithic Times to the Present Oxford University Press, 11 Mar 1993 Retrieved 2012-05-15 The first object or physical thing specifically used in a way similar enough to the modern definition of money, i.e. in exchange, was (probably) cattle (according to R.Davies).Roy and Glyn Davies History of Money Exeter University and the University of Wales Press, Retrieved 2012-05-15 The global contribution to world's GDP by major economies from 1 CE to 2003 CE according to Angus Maddison's estimates. Up until the early 18th century, India and China were the two largest economies by GDP output. Trading in red ochre is attested in Swaziland, shell jewellery in the form of strung beads also dates back to this period, and had the basic attributes needed of commodity money. To organize production and to distribute goods and services among their populations, before market economies existed, people relied on tradition, top-down command, or community cooperation. Agriculture emerged in the fertile crescent, and soon after and apparently independently, in South and East Asia, and the Americas. Cultivation provided complementary carbohydrates in diets, and could potentially produce a surplus to feed off-farm workers enabling the development of diversified and stratified societies (including a standing military and 'leisured class'). Soon after livestock became domesticated particularly in the middle east (goats, sheep, cattle), enabling pastoral societies to develop, to exploit lower productivity grasslands unsuited to agriculture. Antiquity: Bronze and Iron agesEarly developments in formal money and finance= Ancient Egypt was home to almost half of the global population by 30th century BC. The city states of Sumer developed a trade and market economy based originally on the commodity money of the shekel which was a certain weight measure of barley, while the Babylonians and their city state neighbors later developed the earliest system of prices using a metric of various commodities that was fixed in a legal code. The early law codes from Sumer could be considered the first (written) financial law, and had many attributes still in use in the current price system today; such as codified quantities of money for business deals (interest rates), fines for 'wrongdoing', inheritance rules, laws concerning how private property is to be taxed or divided, within etc. For a summary of the laws, see Babylonian law. Temples are history's first documented creditors at interest, beginning in Sumer in the third millennium. By charging interest and ground rent on their own assets and property, temples helped legitimize the idea of interest‚Äëbearing debt and profit seeking in general. Later, while the temples no longer included the handicraft workshops which characterized third‚Äëmillennium Mesopotamia, in their embassy functions they legitimized profit‚Äëseeking trade, as well as by being a major beneficiary. Antiquity: Classical Era The Achaemenid Empire was the only civilization in all of history to connect over 40% of the global population, accounting for approximately 49.4 million of the world's 112.4 million people in around 480 BC. Later, the Roman Empire expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time) and covering 5.0 million square kilometres at its height in AD 117. Eventually, India and China accounted for more than half the size of the world economy for the next 1,500 years. Despite the high GDP, these nations being major population centers, did not have significantly higher GDP per capita. =Expedition and long distance commerce= The two major changes in commercial activity due to expedition known by historical recounting, are those led by Alexander the Great,Quintus Curtius Rufus, William Henry Crosby Quintus Curtius Rufus: Life and exploits of Alexander the Great D.

Greek and Roman thinkers made various economic observations, especially Aristotle and Xenophon. Many other Greek writings show understanding of sophisticated economic concepts. For instance, a form of Gresham‚Äôs Law is presented in Aristophanes‚Äô Frogs. Bryson of Heraclea was a neo-platonic who is cited as having heavily influenced early Muslim economic scholarship.Spengler (1964). Middle Ages In the Middle Ages the world economy slowly expanded with the increase of population and trade. The silk road was used for trading between Europe, Central Asia and China. During the early period of the Middle Ages, Europe was an economic backwater, however, by the later Medieval period rich trading cities in Italy emerged, creating the first modern accounting and finance systems. The field of Islamic economics was also introduced. The first banknotes were used in Tang dynasty China in the ninth century (with expanded use during the Song dynasty). Early Modern Era The Early modern era was a time of mercantilism, nationalism, and international trade. The waning of Feudalism saw new national economic frameworks begin to be strengthened. After the voyages of Christopher Columbus et al. opened up new opportunities for trade with the New World and Asia, newly-powerful monarchies wanted a more powerful military state to boost their status. Mercantilism was a political movement and an economic theory that advocated the use of the state's military power to ensure that local markets and supply sources were protected. The first banknote in Europe was issued by Stockholms Banco in 1661. Proto- industrialization The Mughal India, worth a quarter of world GDP in the 17th century, especially its largest and economically most developed province Bengal Subah, were responsible for 25% of global output, that led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth, ultimately leading to the proto-industrialization. The Industrial Revolution A Watt steam engine, the steam engine fuelled primarily by coal that propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the world.Watt steam engine image: located in the lobby of into the Superior Technical School of Industrial Engineers of the UPM (Madrid) Economic history as it relates to economic growth in the modern sense first occurred during the Industrial Revolution in Britain and then in the rest of Europe, due to high amounts of energy conversion taking place. The twentieth century World GDP per capita in dollars during the twentieth century. Data before 1950 is not annual. Economic growth spread to all regions of the world during the twentieth century, when world GDP per capita quintupled. The highest growth occurred in the 1960s during post-war reconstruction. Some increase in the volume of international trade is due to the reclassification of within-country trade to international trade ‚Äì because of increasing number of countries and resulting changes in national boundaries. The effect is small. In particular, shipping containers revolutionized trade in the second half of the century, by making it cheaper to transport goods, especially internationally.Marc Levinson The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and The World Economy Bigger Princeton University Press, 7 January 2008 Retrieved 2012-05-15 Twenty-first century and the future Despite setbacks related to the global economic crisis or the \\"Great Recession\\" that was mostly predicated on housing and an increase in the use of leverage by both banks and households, the late twentieth and early twenty-first century has seen great increases in global GDP. Much of these increase are due to technological innovations, such as high-speed Internet, smartphones, and numerous other technological advances that have changed the way much of the population lives, unlike any other economic period in history. Unfortunately, these gains have not been uniform across the globe and there are still many countries where people, and especially young children die from what are now preventable diseases, such as rotovirus and polio. =Global economic crisis= The world economy was predicted to shrink by between 0.5% and 1.0% in 2009, the first global contraction in 60 years. In its forecast the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that developed countries will suffer \\"deep recession\\".

The film is loosely based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Graham Greene. The film's plot retains the book's central theme of the adventurous, amoral aunt and her respectable middle class nephew drawn in to share her life, and also features her various past and present lovers who were introduced in the book, while providing this cast of characters with different adventures to the ones thought up by Greene, in different locales (North Africa rather than the book's South America). It was released on December 17, 1972. Plot While attending the cremation of his mother's remains, London bank manager Henry Pulling (Alec McCowen) meets eccentric Augusta Bertram (Maggie Smith), a woman who claims to be his aunt and announces that the woman who raised him was not his biological mother. She invites him back to her apartment, where her lover, an African fortune teller named Zachary Wordsworth (Louis Gossett Jr.), is waiting for her. Shortly after she receives a package allegedly containing the severed finger of her true love, Ercole Visconti (Robert Stephens), with a note promising the two will be reunited upon payment of $100,000. Augusta asks Henry to accompany her to Paris, and he agrees, unaware she actually is smuggling ¬£50,000 out of England and transporting it to Turkey for a gangster named Crowder (Robert Flemyng) in exchange for a ¬£10,000 fee she can put toward the ransom. The works of art adorning the station are shown. The two board the Orient Express, where Henry meets Tooley (Cindy Williams), a young American hippie who takes a liking to him and gets him to smoke marijuana with her in her compartment. When the train reaches Milan, Augusta is greeted at the station by her illegitimate son Mario (Raymond G√©r√¥me), who presents her with a bouquet of flowers and an ear that supposedly belongs to Ercole. When they arrive at the Turkish border, Augusta's plot is uncovered by officials who send her and Henry back to Paris. Augusta attempts to secure the money she needs from her former lover Achille Dambreuse (Jos√© Luis L√≥pez V√°zquez), but the wealthy Frenchman dies of a heart attack in her hotel suite before she achieves her goal. Efforts to extort $100,000 from Achille's widow in return for their silence about the adulterous circumstances of his death fail, and Augusta decides to sell a valuable portrait of herself she claims was painted by Amedeo Modigliani to raise the money. After an argument with Henry, Augusta lets it slip that he is Ercole's \\"other son\\". Once the painting is sold, they join Zachary on a fishing boat to North Africa, where they pay the ransom and are reunited with Ercole. He removes his bandages, revealing ear and finger intact, indicating he has been the mastermind of a plot to separate Augusta from her money. Henry, who was suspicious from the start, reveals not only that he has deduced Augusta is his biological mother, but that he exchanged \\"neatly cut pages of the Barcelona telephone directory\\" for the money in the package they delivered. He wants to use the cash he kept to purchase the portrait Augusta sold, but she tells him she would prefer to use it to finance more travels. Henry decides the matter should be decided with the toss of a coin and chooses 'heads'. Wordsworth tosses the coin, and the film ends on a freeze frame shot of Augusta, Henry and Wordsworth as they await the fall of the coin.

Dambreuse Production George Cukor initially gave Katharine Hepburn a copy of the Graham Greene novel and told her he wanted to cast her as Augusta. Upon first reading the book, basically a collection of anecdotes, she felt it couldn't be adapted into a viable screenplay, but after reading it several more times she agreed to make the film.Edwards, Ann, A Remarkable Woman: A Biography of Katharine Hepburn. New York: William Morrow & Company 1985. , p. 374 She was ultimately unhappy with the completed script, and Jay Presson Allen finally suggested she rewrite the screenplay herself. After working on it for months, Hepburn submitted it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but studio head James T. Aubrey, Jr. felt it was missing the charm of the book. Additionally, he wanted Augusta to be seen as a younger woman in flashbacks, and he felt Hepburn was too old to do so convincingly. In a phone call to the actress, he told her the project was being postponed, but the next day, her agent was advised she was being given notice for refusing to report to work. Hepburn was outraged and considered suing MGM for payment for her contributions to the screenplay, but finally decided against taking legal action.Edwards, pp. 375‚Äì76 Allen later claimed only one speech of hers remained in the completed film, but Hepburn was denied screen credit because she wasn't a member of the Screen Writers Guild. The film was shot on location in England, France, Italy, Morocco, Spain, Turkey and Yugoslavia, with the final scenes shot at Cabo de Gata natural park and Los Genoveses Beach. \\"Serenade of Love,\\" the film's theme song, was written by Jackie Trent and Tony Hatch and performed by Petula Clark. Costume designer Anthony Powell became a close friend of Maggie Smith and dressed her for her later films Death on the Nile, Evil Under the Sun, and Hook as well as the plays Private Lives and Lettice and Lovage. Critical reception Roger Greenspun of The New York Times said the film's \\"great charm\\" lies in > \\"the surprising emotional complexity it manages in terms of its light tone > and its nutty, endlessly involved plotting. Such emotional complexity > depends a good deal on richness of characterization and delicacy of human > contact, and in this the film sometimes succeeds and sometimes doesn't. Alec > McCowen does marvelous things as Henry ... Maggie Smith, playing a woman > twice her age, seems to have surrounded her character rather than to have > inhabited it ... and she is energetic enough for any five ordinary > performers. But it is the energy of caricature rather than personality, and > Aunt Augusta is sufficiently an original not to need any eccentricities > added on. But the film is full of privileged moments, lucid, controlled and > graceful, and any of them might serve to epitomize the style and the meaning > of the valuable cinema of George Cukor.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film \\"a whimsical romantic fantasy that works; which is to say, if you are not a fan of whimsical romantic fantasy, it's going to be too much for you.\\" He added \\"It was nearly too much for me ‚Äì I found myself wincing from time to time when one of the movie's ornate props seemed about to bean me ‚Äì but in the end I was won over, I guess.\\" TV Guide rated it three out of four stars and wrote: > \\"Condensing Greene's novel into a workable screenplay was not entirely > successful. Some moments are glossed over; others fly by all too rapidly in > a valiant attempt to cram in as much of the book as possible within the > 109-minute running time. Though it doesn't always succeed, the spirit is > there often enough to cover the rapid-fire plot development. Cukor gives > this a sort of tongue-in-cheek direction; at this point in his career his > heyday was long past, and the film is no match for some of his earlier > successes. Like its central character, it is unusual, unexpected, and not > entirely what it projects itself to be, yet it is entertaining.\\" Video release The VHS of Travels with My Aunt was released March 26, 1996. An official DVD release came on October 4, 2011 when the film was added to the Warner Archive Collection.

He was survived by his wife, the concert pianist Estelle Wine, and their three children.The Times, 30 December 1967. His father was a rabbi from Lithuania, while scientist Samuel Devons was his brother.William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 219  Life  As a child Devons‚Äô family moved throughout Britain and he was schooled at Hanley High School, Portsmouth Grammar School, and North Manchester Grammar School.Alec Cairncross, ‚ÄòDevons, Ely (1913‚Äì1967)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) . From 1931 to 1934, Devons attended the Victoria University of Manchester where he read Economics, Politics and Modern History and would graduate with first class honours. After graduating he received a research fellowship to undertake an MA specialising in Economics and produced a well-received thesis on productivity that was published in The Economic Journal. He worked as an economic assistant in Manchester at the Joint Committee of Cotton Trades Organisations over the period 1935‚Äì1939 and was brought into the Ministry of Supply, as a statistician working on Cotton Control, soon after the outbreak of the Second World War. Within a year he was encouraged to join the War Cabinet‚Äôs Central Economic Intelligence Service (the precursor to the Economic Section and Central Statistics Office) by John Jewkes and Harry Campion, two former colleagues from Manchester.British Library of Political and Economic Science (BPLES), DEVONS, Box 22. Devons began work in Whitehall in March 1940 and joined a tight group of former academics and economists ‚Äì a group that also included Lionel Robbins, Norman Chester, Alec Cairncross, Evan Durbin, D.G. Champernowne, and Harold Wilson ‚Äì drafted into the British war effort.Alec Cairncross and Nita Watts, The Economic Section 1939-1961: A Study in Economic Advising (London: Routledge, 1989), pp. 50-5. Between 1940 and 1945 he became the first Chief Statistician for the Central Statistics Office, then Director of Statistics, and finally the Director General of Planning, Programmes and Statistics with the Ministry of Aircraft Production. After the war, he returned to Manchester as a Reader in Applied Economics and, in 1947, was appointed the Robert Ottley Professor of Applied Economics (the first such chair in a British University). Despite initial reservations, he remained at Manchester until 1959 and helped to build a dynamic Faculty of Economic and Social Studies working alongside Arthur Lewis, Harry Johnson, Michael Polyani, Max Glukman and Bill Mackenzie.Donald Moggeridge, Harry Johnson: A Life in Economics (Cambridge: CUP, 2008), pp. 161 and 167-8. Devons‚Äô career ended at the London School of Economics (where he had replaced James Meade as Professor of Commerce) when illness forced his early retirement in 1965; the Ely Devons Prize, for outstanding performance in the MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics programme, is awarded in his honour.http://econ.lse.ac.uk/study/programmes/msceme.html. Away from Higher Education, he served on the council of the Royal Economic Society (1956‚Äì1964), the Local Government Commission (1959 to 1965) and as a sometime Government advisor to the aircraft industry and Monopolies Commission.The Manchester Guardian, 29 December 1967.  Influence  Despite being known for his obstinacy, Devons was well liked by his colleagues and well respected by his peers. Though often a critic, he was an able and constructive administrator who held a wide range of research interests.Alec Cairncross, ‚ÄòDevons, Ely (1913‚Äì1967)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) ; The Manchester Guardian, 29 December 1967 and The Times, 4 January 1968. These were disseminated across a range of academic papers, newspaper articles and broadcast talks as well as in a notable survey of his wartime experience.Ely Devons, Planning in Practice: Essays in Aircraft Planning in Wartime (Cambridge: CUP, 1950). This work has since been overlooked by economists and historians alike, but has recently been rediscovered as both as ‚Äòa useful source of practical operations management \\"know how\\"‚Äô and as an important source to use when considering the complex relationship between economics and politics in Britain during the 1940s and 1950s.Denis R.

The character is played by actress Isa Jank from the show's debut on 2 January 1995 to 5 September 2001 Deutsche Dailys.de - First and last appearance of Isa Jank (German) and again since 21 June 2011. Deutsche Dailys.de - Clarissa's return date She left the show again on 20 March 2013. Casting The producers of show knew from the beginning, thanks to the Australian soap opera Sons and Daughters - which Verbotene Liebe was based on, what impact the character Clarissa would have on the show. They needed a strong and powerful actress in the role, who would click with viewers from the first scene. Isa Jank was eventually cast in the role and the producers soon saw that they succeed with the plan to find the right actress to play the role. She gave her debut in the show's premiere and for the prime years of the show became the main antagonist and center of Verbotene Liebe. Clarissa became known as the German Alexis Colby and made the show known as the German glamour soap opera. In 1999, Clarissa's story was partly rewritten with the introduction of her ex-husband Peter Kaufmann. The story was not favored by fans nor Isa Jank herself. The actress began to have disagreements with the producers over her role and it ended in leaving the show only a little over a year after the Peter Kaufmann story was finished. Over the years, rumors of a comeback rose every know and then. In 2011, Jank agreed to return into the iconic role. Her much anticipated return was publicly promoted with \\"the return of the bitch\\". But eventually fans got frustrated as it took almost six months to the final confrontation between Clarissa and Tanja. The rivalry after the confrontation was seen as partly childish and had not seem to have the old strength. Without any official conformation about an exit, Jank had her last tape day in December 2012 after a little bit more than one and a half year on the show. StorylineBackground= Clarissa grows up in poor conditions. When she meets young architect student Arno Brandner, Clarissa falls for him and eventually ends up pregnant. Barely at legal age, Clarissa gives birth to twins, named Jan and Julia. As she doesn't know how to handle motherhood, especially with now two infants, Clarissa leaves Arno and her son Jan behind and decides to start a new life with her daughter Julia. Shortly afterwards, Clarissa meets the young and rich widower Christoph von Anstetten. He is fascinated by Clarissa and eventually ends up marrying her. Clarissa becomes a mother to Christoph's son Henning and more so a very rich and powerful woman. Clarissa's back story gets rewritten in 1999, when a man named Peter Kaufmann claimed to have been married to Clarissa. She is supposed to have met Peter at a young age before meeting Christoph, which led to her first marriage to Christoph being invalid. =1995-2001= In January 1995, Clarissa is living her dream life. She doesn't have to worry about money and it seems as her daughter Julia is about to get engaged to medical student Gero von Sterneck. Clarissa's marriage to Christoph seems happy even though she makes no secret about having had several affairs to her best friend Charlie Schneider. Clarissa's life changes dramatically when she finds out that Julia has met her twin-brother Jan. The situation becomes even more difficult when unknowingly Julia begins to fall in love with Jan. Clarissa tries to keep Jan away from Julia and tells him the truth. Shortly afterwards Julia is diagnosed with leukemia and Jan just might be her only rescue. Clarissa hesitates to reveal her secret to safe her daughters life. When the truth finally comes out, the close relationship that Julia had to her mother is forever destroyed. As Christoph had no idea that Clarissa also has a son, the two face troubles in their marriage. Clarissa finds comfort in the arms of Arno, who has returned into her life as he wants to get to know Julia, while Christoph gets closer to Gero's mother Barbara. Barbara becomes a rival for Clarissa in business as well as in her personal life. Clarissa uses every dirty trick in the book to ruin Barbara's business. But in the end, her schemes costs Clarissa her marriage to Christoph. She sees herself as a victim and promises Christoph and Barbara to make their lives a living hell. While making their lives complicated, Clarissa seems to have found a fair opponent in Tanja Wittkamp, who soon marries Christoph's younger brother Ben after a failed love triangle with Henning and Jan. But soon Clarissa has to realize that Tanja doesn't hold back, not even from murder. She kidnaps Clarissa and later threatens to kill her. When Clarissa finds out that Tanja is responsible for the murder of Cleo Winter, she puts Cleo's fiance Tim Sander in the right direction in order to get rid of Tanja for good. As Clarissa decides to write a book about her glamours life as the wife of Christoph von Anstetten, Peter comes back into her life. He schemes his way to Clarissa's money and publicly humiliates her as an impostor. Christoph uses the information about Peter and Clarissa's marriage to make his marriage to Clarissa invalid. Clarissa later uses evidence for the innocence of Christoph's girlfriend Carolin in a murder case to blackmail Christoph into marrying her again. Realizing that he never can have the life he wants, Christoph commits suicide and shoots himself in front of Clarissa. Clarissa is hunted by what happened to Christoph and blames herself for his death. She even goes into therapy and it takes Clarissa a while to find back to her old self. Right in time for Tanja's return. She escaped from Tim's imprisonment and is now out for revenge on Clarissa. She plots to marry Henning and then stage his murder as a disguised Clarissa. However Clarissa gets behind Tanja's plan and can warn her step-son. Tanja then escapes out of police custody and threatens Clarissa with a loaded gun in a plane, with which Clarissa wanted to take a much needed vacation. Clarissa gets her hand on the gun as the pilot announces that a storm is ahead of them. Henning later gets the news that Clarissa's plane went down with no signs of survival. =2011-2013= In June 2011, Clarissa is waiting for her release out of a South American prison. She sat innocent for being accused of traveling with drugs. Clarissa is sure that this was one last stint from Tanja. Believing that her archenemy is dead, Clarissa wants to start a new life and reunite with her estranged children. She soon finds her daughter Julia on the Spanish island Mallorca and pleads for her forgiveness. Clarissa also reunites with Arno and Charlie who both know that Tanja is still alive and well living a happy life as a businesswoman in Germany, owning Clarissa's old fashion company 'Ligne Clarisse'. As Julia starts to forgive her mother for her past mistakes, Clarissa finds out that Jan is on the island as well. Hoping for a big family reunion, Clarissa soon has to realize that the old feelings between Jan and Julia are still there. Julia's marriage to local doctor Ricardo Mendes starts to fall apart and she soon gives into her feelings for Jan, much to the shock of Arno and Clarissa. While Jan and Julia want to start a new life together, Clarissa can't let go of the past when she finds out that Tanja's still alive. Clarissa returns to D√ºsseldorf with the help of Ansgar von Lahnstein and shocks Tanja with being the new Co-CEO of 'LCL'. Clarissa makes Tanja nervous and lets her know that she wants her company back. She looks at her best shot when Tanja is accused of attempted murder of head designer Sonja J√§ger. Clarissa has proof that Tanja is innocent but holds it back to give Tanja a feeling what prison is like. She later offers the evidence to Tanja for her shares in the company. Tanja refuses at first but is later even willing to give in when the deal falls apart. Clarissa tells her the deal is off the table and that she hopes that Tanja rots in prison. When Tanja's husband Sebastian von Lahnstein is giving part of his liver to Clarissa's grandson Timo Mendes, Clarissa and Tanja have a heart to heart. Clarissa gives Tanja the evidence that can prove her innocence and they both try to be civil with each other. When Ansgar comes up with a plan to get his hands on the family business, he gets Clarissa on board as his partner-in- crime. Clarissa confesses to Ansgar that she still wants 'LCL' for herself and is willing to do whatever it takes to get Tanja out of the company. Ansgar gives Clarissa prove that he simulated the collapse of the 'Lahnstein Bank', while Clarissa writes him over the name rights of 'LCL'. That way they both want to make sure that they don't betray each other. However, when Ansgar finally gets to be the head of 'Lahnstein Enterprises', he starts to see Clarissa as a problem. He hires a private investigator who steals the proof Clarissa has on him. That leads to Ansgar firing Clarissa from her position as Co-CEO of 'LCL'. Clarissa is outraged and while Tanja is named sole CEO of 'LCL', Clarissa wants back what's hers. She visits Ansgar and threatens him with a gun to get back the name rights to 'LCL'. In a fight over the gun, Ansgar is shot. He ends up being fine and is not contacting the police. Clarissa tells Tanja and Sebastian that the collapse of the bank was fake and then decides to leave town. She promises them that she will return and make revenge, then she left with her private driver to the airport.

He is chairman of the European Guitar Teachers Association (EGTA). His guitar music has been published by the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, Chanterelle, Corda Music, Mel Bay and Bardic Edition. Tommis started playing in folk music circles in the 1970s before joining the Ian Campbell Folk Group, with whom he worked from 1977 to 1982. In 1979 he embarked on studies of classical music with Harold Taylor, John Bache and John Woolfe (Music Director for Stratford's Royal Shakespeare Company) before graduation under the professorship of William Mathias at the University College of North Wales, Bangor. As a solo guitarist, he commissioned a new guitar sonata from Gareth Glyn and premiered pieces written especially for him by John Pickard, Jochen Eisentraut and Andy Crowdy. This last was a guitar concerto. He founded the Anglesey Guitar Ensemble in 1993 and this became, under his leadership, a hugely successful group of young musicians. They won two national ensemble competitions and appeared on the BBC's Blue Peter television show, before disbanding in 1997. In the late 1990s Tommis joined the experimental band Ogam, which aimed to present traditional Welsh melodies in unusual arrangements. Since then Tommis has collaborated with musicians such as Huw Warren, Gwyn Evans, and Lleuwen Steffan in the recording of many of his own songs.

Launched in 2005, she was owned by Bob Oatley (Oatley's estate since his passing in 2016) and skippered by New South Wales Mark Richards, who founded Palm Beach Yachts Australia. Design and Construction Wild Oats XI is a state-of-the-art maxi yacht designed by Reichel/Pugh and built by Mcconaghy Boats, five months after her near-sistership Alfa Romeo II, from which she borrowed extensively.http://www.mcconaghyboats.com/wild-oats-xi.html She was launched in December 2005 after a 9-month build and won her first Sydney- Hobart the same month. She is distinctively narrow with a beam and originally featured \\"canting ballast twin foil\\" appendages enabling her to carry a large sail plan without compromising stability. She has undergone many modifications over time to keep her competitive: In 2009 she was lengthened at bow and stern from 98ft to 100ft to meet the new limit in the Sydney-Hobart. In 2011 her forward balanced spade canard was removed and twin daggerboards were added amidships. In 2012 she received a bow centreboard as well as caudal fin winglets on her torpedo bulb. In 2013 she was equipped with a Dynamic Stability System (DSS) foil, which is a retractable horizontal foil deployed on the leeward side of the boat. In 2015 her stern was shortened by 2m and her 12m forward sections were replaced by a 14m longer, sleeker bow, keeping her midship sections unmodified and in effect moving her entire existing sailplan aft by 2m. All mechanical systems onboard Wild Oats XI are powered by a continually running Diesel generator, excluding manual backup systems, making the boat entirely dependent on the auxiliary. This limits the boat's autonomy as it cannot be sailed once the fuel is exhausted but this enables significant grinding crew weight savings. Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race In her first season Wild Oats XI won the \\"treble\\" in the 2005 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, winning on elapsed (line honours) and corrected time (handicap) as well as setting a new race record. In the 2007 race, Wild Oats XI equalled the 59-year-old record of Morna, by taking line honours in the race three times in a row. In the 2008 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, Wild Oats XI broke the record, winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive line honours. Wild Oats XI won the Sydney Hobart \\"treble\\" again in 2012, setting a new record of 1 day 18 hours 23 minutes 12 seconds.http://rolexsydneyhobart.com/standings/ Wild Oats XI made her Sydney to Hobart debut in 2005, and made an immediate impact on the race. Racing out of the Heads, she arrived in record time, breaking the 1999 race record set by the Volvo Ocean 60 Nokia.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHet3SuWJZs Wild Oats XI won on elapsed time, won on corrected time, and set a new record, becoming the only boat since the inaugural race of 1945 to do all three feats. The following year, 2006, Wild Oats XI was equally dominant, taking line honours in 2 days, 8 hours, 52 minutes and 33 seconds. Arriving at 9:52 pm, the yacht sailed into Sullivans Cove to rapturous applause by a large crowd gathered on the docks, who were appreciative of her achieving her 'double' despite being battered in heavy seas. The 2007 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race saw Wild Oats XI equal the 59-year-old record of Morna, by winning a hat-trick of line honours titles. Wild Oats XI lined up for the start of the 2008 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race aiming to make history, and set a new record in her own right by becoming the only yacht to win four consecutive line honours titles, and did so, leading for the duration and completing the race in 1 day, 20 hours, 34 minutes 14 seconds. The 2008 race was not without difficulty for the crew though, as they picked up debris in Sydney Harbour which added excess drag, and also collided with a two-metre (6.5 foot) shark. The crew felt that the collision may have actually assisted them by dislodging the snag from their hull. The time set by Wild Oats XI in 2005 of 1 day, 18 hours, 40 minutes and 10 seconds, remained the race record until 2012 when it was bettered by 16 minutes. Wild Oats XI won line honours for the fifth time in the 2010 race, although the yacht's crew faced a protest against their win which could have resulted in disqualification. Under sailing instruction 44.1(A), yachts are required to report their position by radio as they pass Green Cape, the entrance to Bass Strait. The rule was created following the disastrous 1998 race in which five boats sank and six sailors died. As the yacht passed the cape, the crew realised that a blown fuse had rendered their high-frequency radio non- functional. They reported their position to race organisers via satellite phone, but race officials forwarded a complaint to an international jury, alleging that the crew had violated what race committee chairman Tim Cox called \\"one of the fundamental safety rules of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race\\". The complaint was dismissed by the jury, and Wild Oats XI was awarded its fifth Sydney to Hobart line honours.Wild Oats XI's Sydney-to-Hobart victory hung on a $20 glitch, The Australian, 30 December 2010. In the 2011 race Wild Oats came second to Investec Loyal in a time of 2 days, 6 hours, 17 minutes and 26 seconds. They finished 2 minutes and 48 seconds behind. The 2012 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race saw the super maxi once again take line honours. The race time of one day, 18 hours and 23 minutes and 12 seconds broke the yacht's own race record by 16 minutes and 58 seconds. She also completed the \\"treble\\" for the second time, winning on elapsed time, winning on corrected time and breaking the race record. She is the only boat to have achieved this feat since the inaugural race of 1945.http://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/standings/?raceId=99&categoryId;=427&raceTime;= In the 2015 edition of the race, Wild Oats was damaged and limped back to Sydney. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-26/wild-oats-xi-retires-from- sydney-to-hobart/7055142 In 2016, Wild Oats was forced to abandon the race.http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2016/12/26/wild-oats-xi-retires-sydney- hobart-race/ In 2017, Wild Oats XI finished the race in the shortest time period; however, the international jury subsequently held that she had fouled Comanche breaking Rules 10 and 13. A one-hour penalty was applied in lieu of disqualification, giving Comanche Line honours.http://rolexsydneyhobart.com/media/3435643/protest-1.pdf The 2018 Sydney to Hobart race was described as \\"redemption\\"https://www.facebook.com/SkyNewsAustralia/videos/wild-oats-xi- skipper-mark-richards-its-a-day-of-redemption-for-us-it-was-an- amaz/2017464718345486/ by Skipper Mark Richards, after they won line honours for the first time since 2014 with a time of 1 day, 19 hours, 7 minutes and 21 seconds. The 2018 race was possibly one of the closest between the Supermaxis. After arguably the best start of the maxis, Wild Oats led the fleet until essentially coming to a stop just short of the first buoy, allowing Black Jack to slip past. Wild Oats recovered quickly enough to keep beside Christian Beck's Infotrack and overtake her to windward. Black Jack led the fleet out of the heads followed by Wild Oats, Infotrack, Scallywag and the Carkeek 60 Winnings Appliances before Comanche struggled out of the heads. Heading out furthest to the East, Wild Oats had a short lived advantage, overtaking then race leader Comanche early on the morning of Day 2. This was soon to be reversed when she was later overtaken by Comanche, Black Jack and for a short period, Infotrack. However, things swayed to Wild Oats' advantage on the morning of Day 3, when she overtook Comanche and Black Jack rounding Port Arthur, and led for the rest of the race, taking out a several-mile lead. Despite this redemption, Black Jack's owner, Peter Harburg, suggested that Wild Oats had violated race rules when their Automatic Identification System (AIS) was allegedly turned off to prevent other boats identifying her location. While Black Jack and Comanche, race record holder and previous line honours holder, made no formal protest, the Race Committee of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race protested Wild Oats for the violation of racing rules. This was despite criticism of Comanche skipper and owner, Jim Cooney, who said that he didn't \\"think anyone should rely on it as a tactical tool\\" and that it \\"made no difference to us at all\\". https://www.sportsradio.com.au/comanche- skipper-speaking-for-myself-i-wouldnt-be-pursuing-it/ The International Jury found that: The Race Committee‚Äôs investigation and subsequent protest arose from the report from the owner of Black Jack, a competitor in the Race and therefore a person with a conflict of interest within the meaning of the Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS). The Race Committee‚Äôs investigation was prudent, however in these circumstances, for the protest to be valid under the Racing Rules of Sailing, a competitor with information about a potential rule breach must lodge the protest. Rules that apply: RRS60.2 (a), Definitions ‚Äì Conflict of Interest. Decision: Protest Invalid.http://www.rolexsydneyhobart.com/news/2018/day-4/result-protest- against-wild-oats-xi/ This meant that Wild Oats was able to retain their record-breaking 9 line honours victories.

Biography He was born to a family of merchants. When he was six, they moved to Copenhagen. At the age of eighteen, he passed the journeyman test to enter the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. He studied with Niels Simonsen and Wilhelm Marstrand and was awarded two silver medals, in 1860 and 1861, when he began exhibiting portraits and small figure compositions.Biographical notes @ Kunstindeks Danmark. During 1860, he made a brief study trip to Belgium and the Netherlands. He was dissatisfied with these works, however and, after failing to win a gold medal, nearly decided to quit painting and become a teacher or clerk. His hopes were restored after a relative gave him enough money to study in Italy. He arrived in Rome in 1864 and lived in the nearby mountain villages until 1866. Despite a chronic illness, he managed to finish several genre works and hold a small exhibition. After that, he turned to works on Classical themes, completing his most familiar work depicting Chione killed by Diana (Artemis). In October 1866, he began to travel (briefly visiting Paris) and died of cholera in Florence. His most ambitious work and one often described as his main work‚ÄîRoman Workmen Transporting an Antique Imperial Statue from the Colosseum through the Arch of Titus to the Capitoline Museums was completed shortly before his death.Hornung, Peter Michael (1993) Ny dansk kunsthistorie bind 4: Realismen .

An energetic and entrepreneurial spirit with boundless imagination and a playful sense of humor, at that time Adelman was prone to saying he \\"teaches at the University of Toronto and studies at Rochdale.\\" Adelman was the founder and director of York's Centre for Refugee Studies (1988‚Äì1993) and for ten years he was editor of Canada's periodical on refugees, Refuge until 1993. =Service and recognition= Adelman served in many university positions at York University, including acting dean of Atkinson College, two terms as director of the graduate program in philosophy, and chair of the Department of Philosophy at York University. He served as Vice-Chair, York University Senate (1980‚Äì81), and as its Chair (1981‚Äì82). Adelman served as National Chair of Canadian Professors for Peace in the Middle East (1983‚Äì84), and Director of the Refugee Documentation Project (1982‚Äì86). In 2008 Adelman was honored as the keynote speaker at the First Annual Howard Adelman Lecture in celebration of the Centre for Refugee Studies‚Äô 20th anniversary. Held during Refugee Rights Week in Toronto, Adelman reviewed recent research on refugees, suggesting it is probably more beneficial than detrimental to assist refugees.Adelman, Howard, \\"Does Research on Refugees Help Refugees?\\" Refugee Rights Week. York University Centre for Refugees, Toronto, Ontario, April 10, 2008. =Post- retirement= After retiring in 2003, Adelman was appointed visiting professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 2004. In 2008, Adelman is senior research fellow at the Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. He serves as the deputy convener of GovNet, a consortium of researchers on governance issues in Australia, and as research director of the International Consortium of Research on Governance of the Health Workforce. He is producer and host of a weekly television program, Israel Today, broadcast in Canada and parts of the United States. In December 2016, Adelman was named a Member of the Order of Canada.\\"Order of Canada's newest appointees include Paralympian, Supreme Court judge and astrophysicist\\". CBC News, December 30, 2016. Scholarship The author, coauthor or editor of 23 scholarly books and over 100 articles and book chapters, in addition to numerous other papers, addresses, and professional reports, Adelman has written extensively on the Middle East, humanitarian intervention, membership rights, ethics, early warning and conflict management, refugee repatriation, policy and resettlement, including his contribution in 2000 to the Institutional Component of the Early Warning and Conflict Management System set up by IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) for the Horn of Africa. Perhaps best known for his work in applied philosophy concerning refugees, immigration policy and genocide, Adelman published a major study entitled Early Warning and Conflict Management: Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda (1996) as part of the 5 volume study International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience. In 1999, he co-edited The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to Zaire, already regarded a classic on the subject. Adelman served as an associate editor for the Macmillan three-volume Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity (2005). These efforts earned international acclaim. His earlier works included publications on social criticism and reform of universities, including The University Game, co-edited with Dennis Lee (1968), The Beds of Academe (1970), and The Holiversity (1973). =Selected publications= *Military Intervention and Non-Intervention in the Twenty-First Century: An Australian Perspective, with Charles Sampford. 2009.

On January 24, 1776, Congressional delegate Edward Rutledge, echoing General George Washington's own concerns, suggested that a war office similar to Great Britain's be established.Wright, p. 89.Ford, v. 4, pp. 85‚Äì86. Pressure from WashingtonWashington to Congress (June 13, 1776). and the large volume of military business led Congress to establish the Board of War and Ordnance on June 12, 1776.Ford, v. 5, pp. 434‚Äì435. Five delegates of Congress, initially John Adams, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Harrison, James Wilson, and Edward Rutledge, assisted by a permanent secretary, Richard Peters, composed the Board of War. They assumed the prescribed responsibilities for compiling a master roster of all Continental Army officers; monitoring returns of all troops, arms, and equipment; maintaining correspondence files; and securing prisoners of war. The Board of War began functioning on June 21, 1776.Board of War to Washington (June 21, 1776). Organization of the Board of War underwent several significant changes after its inception.Wright, p. 121‚Äì122. The original board could not keep pace with the volume of work, and in early April 1777 it recommended its own replacement by a permanent administrative body.Ford, v. 7, pp. 241‚Äì242. On October 17, 1777, Congress approved a plan that called for a Board of War consisting of three permanent members‚Äîmen who were not members of Congress‚Äîplus a clerical staff.Ford, v. 9, pp. 818‚Äì820. Congress also expanded the board's duties. In addition to the administrative functions of its predecessor, the new board's responsibilities included supervising recruitment and producing weapons. It was to act as Congress' sole official intermediary in dealing with the Army and the states on military affairs. On November 7, 1777, Quartermaster General Thomas Mifflin, Adjutant General Timothy Pickering, and Robert Hanson Harrison, Washington's military secretary, were elected as members,Ford, v. 9, p. 874. although Harrison promptly declined. Mifflin persuaded Congress to expand the board to five members, which it did on November 24, and recommended Richard Peters (the permanent secretary of the old board) and Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates for the new vacancies.Ford, v. 9, pp. 959‚Äì960. Congress appointed both men and named former Commissary General Joseph Trumbull to replace Harrison. At Mifflin's suggestion, Gates was named president of the board.Ford, v. 9, pp. 971‚Äì972. Robert Troup served as Secretary to the Board of War from February 1778 until its dissolution. Various modifications to the structure and duties of the Board of War continued to be made throughout the war. For example, on October 29, 1778, Congress again modified the membership of the Board to now include two members of Congress and three permanent commissioners,Ford, v. 12, p. 1076. and the Departments of the Quartermaster General and Commissaries General of Purchases and Issues were placed under the direction of the board on November 25, 1779.Ford, v. 15, p. 1312.

Ashton (26 June 1919 - 25 August 2004) was an Academy Award- nominated and BAFTA-winning English art director most noted for his work on such films as Billy Budd (1962), The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) and Young Winston (1972). Background Born Donald Martin Ashton in Edmonton, London, in 1917, Ashton was the son of a wine buyer. He was educated at Boxlane School, Palmers Green. After training as an architect, on the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the R.A.F., serving in the Middle and Far East. During the latter part of the war he was posted to Ceylon, where he served with Lord Louis Mountbatten's unit. He joined the film industry in 1947 at the suggestion of actor and playwright, Emlyn Williams,.The Independent Obituaries 30 September 2004 His first job was working as an uncredited draughtsman for the Boulting brothers on their film Brighton Rock. The film starred Richard Attenborough, who was to employ Ashton many years later to design two of the films he directed. During the 1950s and 1970s Ashton acquired a reputation as one of the best production designers in the business with such works as The Bridge on the River Kwai and Young Winston. For this, his last film with Attenborough, Ashton was nominated for an Academy Award in the category for Best Art Direction. Second career In the early 1970s Harry Saltzman, the producer of the James Bond films, was so taken with Ashton's sets that he asked him to redesign the interior of his house. It was the beginning of a new chapter in Ashton's career as a designer of hotels and restaurants, particularly in Asia. His most famous is the magnificent five-star Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong, regarded as one of the most elegant hotels in the world. This work resulted in Ashton receiving commissions to design more Mandarin hotels and many of the Sheraton hotels being built around the world. The projects made Ashton a wealthy man, allowing him to purchase homes in Mayfair and Amersham, Buckinghamshire. He lived in Hong Kong for 20 years.

BYU represented the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in only their second bowl game as a program, and Oklahoma State represented the Big Eight Conference. The matchup pitted the two schools in the postseason for the second time in three years, following the 1974 Fiesta Bowl, a game in which the Cowboys defeated the Cougars by a score of 16-6. Oklahoma State's running back Terry Miller broke the Tangerine Bowl records for total net yards run and longest run from scrimmage as well as tying another with four touchdowns scored as OSU defeated BYU, 49‚Äì21.

After travels in California, Texas, and Arizona, he established a cattle ranch south of present-day Bend, Oregon, before the founding of Bend or surrounding Deschutes County. He blazed trails through the Cascade Mountains and was a renowned bear hunter. He fathered eight children, including three doctors, and was a leading citizen of Central Oregon for many years. Early life Vandevert was born in Cottage Grove in the Willamette Valley of Oregon to Grace Clark Vandevert, born in England and survivor of the Clark Massacre of 1851 on the Oregon Trail. His father was Jackson Vandevert, partner of Thomas Clark, Grace's brother, in the California goldfields of 1849.Burgderfer Vandevert's ancestor, Michael Pauluzen Van der Voort, was an early settler of Dutch New Amsterdam, now New York City. When he was 15, Vandevert's uncle, Thomas Clark, persuaded his mother to let William help him drive 29 horses to California. William broke his shoulder when he was thrown from his horse but continued on the trip. He returned with three horses of his own, a saddle, and $200 in gold.Power Aged 17, while traveling to the Silver Lake-Summer Lake area of Oregon with a survey crew, William first saw the land that later became the Vandevert Ranch. It was a meadow on the Little Deschutes River, surrounded by pine forest, with a view of the Cascade Mountains, particularly Mount Bachelor.Linn In the 1870s he carried mail from Camp Warner in Oregon to Fort Bidwell in California, riding through the area of the Modoc War as it was in progress. He appeared in the San Francisco newspapers when, on one trip, he killed a much-feared \\"Silver Lake Grizzly\\" that the hunters who had cornered it were afraid to approach. Vandevert got so close to the bear that the powder from his gun singed the bear's hair.Gardner In 1876 Vandevert left for Texas where he joined the large cattle-ranching Hash Knife Outfit. On his travels between Oregon and Texas he spent a season herding sheep for the Requa family in the hills above Oakland, California. During that time he met Joaquin Miller, Oakland's then-famous poet, and reported that Miller was the dirtiest man he'd ever met.Vincent Vandevert  Marriage and children  In 1878, Sadie Vinceheller, well-educated and fluent in French and Spanish, arrived in Fort Griffin, Texas to teach at a school. Alighting from the stagecoach, she knocked on the door of a nearby house hoping to borrow a lantern to light her way to her arranged lodgings. William Vandevert answered the door. The two were married in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, on 10 November 1880. After the Hash Knife Outfit was acquired by the newly formed Aztec Land & Cattle Company in 1884, the couple moved with the company to Holbrook, Arizona. They experienced the decline of the company due to drought and overgrazing before leaving in about 1889. According to their granddaughter, Grace McNellis, the family never learned for sure why the couple left Arizona, but speculated that Sadie was homesick to see her sister in New York City, and tired of the chaos in Arizona during the time connected with the Pleasant Valley War. According to McNellis: \\"I'm sure Sadie, by then, with five children, needed to get away from that kind of atmosphere. She was raised a rather genteel lady in Kentucky and I'll bet she never dreamed of ending up like that in Arizona. She must have matured rather rapidly after marrying Grampa.\\" They couple left Arizona in 1889, had another child, Kathryn Grace, in New York on May 26, 1890, and they New York in 1891 when Sadie was pregnant with another son, Claude. They arrived at William's father's ranch in Powell Butte, Oregon, in approximately December 1891, and Claude was born in January 1892. They only lived in New York for one year, in Spring Valley, Rockland County.McNellis Interview and E-mail William and Sadie had eight children: *Mittye ‚Äì born August 17, 1883 in Fort Worth, Texas.

Vandevert Ranch  While the couple were in New York, William's brother Charlie wrote to him to say he had bought the land on the Little Deschutes River in Oregon that William had always admired. Charlie was holding the property to sell to William, who bought the land for $600 and established the ranch in 1892, building a log homestead, raising his family, and raising cattle. Bill bought from Charlie the eastern of the ranch that had been homesteaded by a man named Scoggins. Vandevert himself homesteaded the western of what came to be known as Vandevert Ranch. The ranch was at times a post office and a stagecoach stop. William's son Claude said that, \\"... my mother was from Kentucky and a Democrat and she got the post office ‚Äì we had it right here at home.\\" The post office was established in 1893 and was named after John G. Carlisle, also from Kentucky, who was Grover Cleveland's Secretary of the Treasury.McNellis Interview A visitor in 1898 wrote the area had a \\"real backwoods\\" appearance but noted the Vandeverts \\"had sent their daughter to school in the east.\\" This was the oldest daughter, Mittye, who had stayed in the east with relatives. \\"They had a little store and a blacksmith shop but were stock raisers for the most part.\\"Lemon, Emma R. The first settler to know the surrounding area well, Vandevert added to his income by guiding hunting trips for bear. He once guided the two sons of E.H. Harriman, the famous railroad builder. The family added further to its income by trapping otter, beaver, and mink. Vandevert was a proficient sheep shearer and could do a hundred sheep a day at ten cents a head.Bill Vandevert, Bear Hunter In 1898 and 1899 Bill worked for the Department of the Interior as the first forest ranger in Central Oregon. He would take a pack string into the mountains from Sisters to North Umpqua and send in reports. He would be gone two weeks, rest a week or so, and go back out again. He blazed a large number of trails.Claude Vandevert, Indian Meadows, p. 23 In Holbrook, Arizona, Vandevert had become acquainted with Alexander M. Drake. When Drake came to build irrigation canals and develop the city of Bend in the early 1900s, Vandevert helped give him the lay of the land. Vandevert was an active member of the Bend Commercial Club, the Masons, and the Pioneer Association. Even in the isolated environment of the ranch, Sadie ensured that her children were well-educated. Three of them became doctors, including Clint Vandevert, a leading and respected doctor in Bend for many years. Due to problems in the small local school, some of the older children started staying at the Drakes' in 1903 and going to school in Bend. Vandevert helped build a new school in Bend in 1904.Claude Vandevert, Indian Meadows, p. 22 In 1929 the one-room Harper School was moved to the ranch and operated there until the 1950s.http://207.36.124.253/harper_school.html A quarrelsome family settled near the ranch and some cattle were stolen. The mother died mysteriously and the father disappeared. After much persuasion, Vandevert assisted in the search. The father's body was found buried under a smoldering fire. He had been shot in the back of his head and the bullet lodged against his temple. A member of the search party gave the opinion that the man had been shot with a .45 pistol. Vandevert had the only .45 pistol in the area and insisted that the bullet be dug out. Lacking surgeon's tools the local doctor tried sawing through the skull but gave up, leaving Vandevert to finish the job. The sheriff used a table fork to extract the bullet. It was a .32 bullet. The man's son was indicted but found not guilty. Facts uncovered later confirmed the verdict. Vandevert took his entire family to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition of 1905 in Portland. The family traveled by wagon over the Santiam Pass, stocked up on fruit and vegetables not available in Central Oregon, and came back via a river barge to The Dalles.Strope Well into the 1930s Native Americans would visit the ranch every fall to hunt deer. They set up teepees and a sweathouse near the river. When they visited the homestead, Vandevert conversed with them in their own language.McNellis, Home on the Vandevert Ranch In the 1940s Vandevert Ranch neighbored Camp Abbot. During World War II the camp trained 10,000 combat engineers. Grace McNellis recounted a story about the soldiers that were participating in the Oregon Maneuver. The soldiers were practicing maneuvers in the fields surrounding the ranch. Grace's father, Claude, approached the soldiers while they were cooking food. The soldiers said that they would make sure to clean up the area and they would dispose of the food by burying it. The soldiers told him that next platoon of soldiers that came through would want fresh food so they could not reuse the food. Rather than it being buried, Claude struck a deal with the soldiers. Claude purchased some pigs and had the soldiers bring him all the excess food that would have been buried and wasted. In return, Claude allowed the soldiers to pick up the extra hay in the field for use in their sleeping bags. Sadie died in 1924 and William lived on the ranch until two days after his ninetieth birthday in 1944. Ownership and management of the ranch passed to his two sons, Thomas William and Claude Chandler, who finally sold the ranch in 1970. One hundred years after the original founding of the ranch, the land, with an additional , became a 22-lot luxury gated community still known as Vandevert Ranch. The original log homestead was rebuilt and the schoolhouse was completely renovated.  Notes  References  *McNellis, G. V. (1999). Home on the Vandevert Ranch.

Although Needham was notorious in London at the time, little is recorded of her life, and no genuine portraits of her survive. Her house was the most exclusive in London and her customers came from the highest strata of fashionable society, but she eventually ran afoul of the moral reformers of the day and died as a result of the severe treatment she received after being sentenced to stand in the pillory. Character Nothing is known of Needham's early life, but by the time she was middle-aged she was renowned in London as the keeper of a brothel in Park Place, St. James. Her house was regarded as the most exclusive in London, superior to those of Covent Garden, even to that of the other notorious bawd of the time, Mother Wisebourne.Linnane (2003) p.109 She was said to still be attractive in middle-age; Hogarth described her as a \\"handsome old Procuress ... well dressed in silk\\", but mentions \\"patches on her face\\" and in his picture her face is seen to be pock-marked. She went by a number of aliases: Bird, Howard, Blewitt and Trent are among those ascribed to her, although Mother Bird was also the name of another brothel- keeper who was committed to Newgate Prison with Needham in 1724. Needham was apparently ruthless with the girls and women who worked for her. They were forced to hire their dresses from her, and, if they were unable to pay the exorbitant rentals, she would force them to take more customers or have them committed to debtors' prison until they met her demands (a scheme John Cleland's heroine falls prey to in Fanny Hill (1748)). Once they were too old or too ill to attract customers, she would throw them out. Needham procured her prostitutes from many sources including the houses of other brothel- keepers, the \\"Bails\\" in Covent Garden where homeless girls would sleep rough, Tom King's Coffee House, and, it appears, from auctions,Burford p.70 but, as depicted in Hogarth's picture, she particularly targeted girls and women fresh from the country. The essayist Richard Steele found her pitching to a newly arrived girl when he went to meet a wagon bringing him items from the countryside. He described her as \\"artful\\", and it seems that she was friendly and engaging with her potential employees, revealing her vicious character only when they were under her roof; in The Dunciad, Alexander Pope warns not to \\"... lard your words with Mother Needham's style\\".Linnane (2003) p.110 Pope mentions her once more at the end of The Dunciad (1728), making reference to her foul mouth, and again, alongside other notorious madams of the day, in the last verses of his Coronation Epistle (which were suppressed in editions of the poem from 1769 until 1954): > For Want of you, we spend our random Wit on The first we find with Needham, > Brooks, or Briton. Henry Fielding refers to her in his Pasquin (1736) and used Hogarth's representation of her as the model for Mother Punchbowl in The Covent Garden Tragedy (1732).Paulson (2000) p.89 Mary Davys's bawd in the Accomplish'd Rake of 1727 is called \\"Mother N-d-m\\" and targets young girls fresh from the countryside, just as Needham did.Paulson (1992) p.252 Customers Chief among her customers were Francis Charteris and his cousin the Duke of Wharton‚ÄîCharteris is lounging in the doorway behind Needham in Hogarth's picture. Ronald Paulson suggests that the model for Moll Hackabout in Hogarth's first scene is Ann Bond, who was lured by Needham and raped by Charteris.Paulson (2000) p.313 Charteris, already known as the \\"Rape-Master General\\", was convicted and sentenced to death as a result of the Bond rape, although he was later pardoned. Needham's name was not mentioned during the legal proceedings. The connection with Sally Salisbury only served to heighten the reputation of Needham's house. Needham may have introduced Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708.Burford p.47 Salisbury was the pre-eminent prostitute of the day and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society.Linnane (2003) p.102 Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting him to bed at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter as a joke.Burford p.50 Some idea of the reputation of Needham's house can be gathered from one of Joe Miller's Jests, which involves her asking her landlord to wait for his money until Parliament and the Convocation sit, at which point she will be able to pay him ten times over, and by a satirical premature obituary, which appeared in the London Journal. The latter describes a will in which she distributes appropriate gifts to her famous clients: \\"a picture of Sodom and Gomorrah to indorsing D‚Äïn; an ounce of Mercuris Dulcis to Beau C‚Äïe, of St. Martin's Lane; her estate to the Duke of Wharton; her library to Ned C‚Äï; and a receipt to cure a clap to little Quibus\\". At the time, the figures mentioned would not have been spared their blushes by the omission of their full names, but identifying them now is guesswork. Her well-connected clientele may have allowed her to escape arrest. Despite the popular notion that Sally Salisbury's 1723 stabbing of John Finch, the son of the Duchess of Winchelsea, had taken place in her house (it had actually occurred at the Three Tuns Tavern in Covent Garden), the first time Needham was raided was in 1724: The constables had found \\"two women in bed with two men of distinction\\". The men were bound over, but the women were sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell to do hard labour.Moore p.112 Needham's punishment on this occasion is not recorded, but it appears that she was still incarcerated in September when her house burned down, killing one of the inhabitants, Captain Barbute, a French officer. In 1728, several of her girls were arrested, but she appears to have escaped punishment. Arrest, conviction and death In late 1730, Sir John Gonson, a Justice of the Peace and fervent supporter of the Society for the Reformation of Manners, spurred on by the furore surrounding the Charteris rape case, began conducting raids on brothels all over London. By early 1731 he had arrived at St James, where some residents of Park Place reported \\"a Notorious Disorderly House in that Neighbourhood\\". In truth, Needham's house was hardly unknown, having served the upper echelons of society for years, but she was arrested by Gonson and committed to the Gatehouse by Justice Railton. On 29 April 1731, Needham was convicted of keeping a disorderly house, fined one shilling, and sentenced to stand twice in the pillory, and \\"to find sureties for her good behaviour for 3 years\\". On 30 April she was taken to the pillory near Park Place to stand for the first time. Perhaps because of her connections, she was allowed to lie face down in front of the pillory and a number of guards were paid to protect her. Despite this she received such a pelting that it was thought likely she would die before her punishment was completed. The crowds that had gathered to see her pilloried were so large that one boy fell on an iron fencing rail while trying to get a better look and was killed. Needham was taken from the pillory alive, but died on 3 May 1731, the day before she was due to stand in the pillory (this time at New Palace Yard) for the second time. With her last words she apparently expressed great fear at having to stand in the pillory again after the severe punishment she had received the first time.Paulson (2003) p.98 The Grub Street Journal, the satirical journal allied with Alexander Pope and others of Hogarth's friends, sardonically reported that the populace \\"acted very ungratefully, considering how much she had done to oblige them\\". Her demise was celebrated in a mocking rhyme: > Ye Ladies of Drury, now weep Your voices in howling now raise For Old Mother > Needham's laid deep And bitter will be all your Days. She who drest you in > Sattins so fine Who trained you up for the Game Who Bail, on occasion would > find And keep you from Dolly and Shame Now is laid low in her Grave... Hogarth was still at work on A Harlot's Progress when she died, so she never saw herself immortalised. There were other madams ready to step into her shoes, but it was not until Mother Douglas took over the King's Head in Covent Garden in 1741 that a brothel reappeared with a reputation to match that of Needham.Burford p.128 See also *Damaris Page *Elizabeth Cresswell NotesCitationsReferences   * * Further reading * Category:17th-century births Category:1731 deaths Category:English brothel owners and madams Category:18th-century English businesspeople Category:18th- century English businesswomen ","title":"Elizabeth Needham"},{"id":"20868407","text":"Lewis Albert (King) Brockett (July 23, 1880 ‚Äì September 19, 1960) was a Major League Baseball pitcher and third baseman.

Mukundan Though he had started writing much before the railway stint and even wrote the novel Vasoori, it was his second novel Sakshi that brought him laurels. The book had a great impact on the younger generation of Malayalam readers and was credited with breaking new grounds in Malayalam literature. In early 1960s, he shot into prominence as one of the most promising writers in Malayalam and was among the pioneers of the modernist trend in Malayalam literature. Kakkanadan's early works broke new ground in Malayalam fiction on account of their earnest exploration of deeper realities of life by employing a new diction and narrative methods. Though vast majority of readers initially found it hard to accept the modern trends ushered in by Kakkanadan and some of his contemporaries, their works soon created a new sensibility marking a radical break from the past. He was one of the harbingers of modernism in the genres of Malayalam novel and short story. Though labelled by his readers as a formidable ultramodern Malayalam writer, Kakkanadan himself was of the view that modernism in literature has no convincing rationale. Several of his works are considered landmarks in the history of literary modernism in Malayalam. Moving with ease from apocalyptic visions to tantric imagery, he made his works representative of an important strand in the larger modernist trends in arts, literature and culture in India. Kakkanadan with Perumbadavam Sreedharan Kakkanadan was a rebel, both in life and literature. His rebellion extended from his selection of themes and use of subversive language to his careful crafting of the philosophy of angst into the writing. He often traversed the sweat zones of life and spoke of the valleys of the unknowing. With a stunningly violent style, he shook the very roots of the progressive literary sensibilities of the 1960s and 1970s and its innocent certainties. His was a world of dark tones and darker people, many of them social rejects. He often spoke of the seamy side, the world of puss and blood. Each of his works was an act of rebellion against accepted elitist social mores and codes. Sex, like violence, was a leitmotif in many of his works; at times as a resonant chant, at others as an explosive outpouring of raw human power that transcends both the demonic and the divine. Kakkanadan's major novels are Sakshi (1967), Ezham Mudra (1968), Vasoori (1968), Ushnamekhala (1969), Kozhi (1971), Parankimala (1971), Ajnathayude Thaazhvara (1972), Innaleyude Nizhal (1974), Adiyaravu (1975), Orotha (1982), Ee Naaykkalute Lokam (1983) and Barsaathi (1986). His most noted short story collections are Yuddhaavasaanam (1969), Purathekkulla Vazhi (1970), Aswathamaavinte Chiri (1979), Sreechakram (1981), Alwar Thirunagarile Pannikal (1989), Uchayillaatha Oru Divasam (1989) and Jaappaana Pukayila (2005). He has other novels, short story collections, travelogues and essay collections to his credit. Director Bharathan adapted the novels Parankimala and Adiyaravu for the films Parankimala (1981) and Parvathy (1981). K. G. George's Onappudava (1978) was based on Kakkanadan's novel of the same name. Kakkanadan's short story Chithalukal was made into a film by Kamal, titled Unnikrishnante Adyathe Christmas (1988). He won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for his short-story collection Aswathamavinte Chiri in 1980 and for his novel Orotha in 1984. In 2005 he won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award for Jappana Pukayila and in 2008 he was bestowed with the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Fellowship. Kakkanadan was a craze among the younger generation of Kerala during the 1960s and 1970s.

HistoryEarly history= Amy Adams started a children's clothing business from her own home in Birmingham in 1933. She then opened another three stores in quick succession. Until 1973, Amy Adams and her son Michael ran the company independently, when they sold it to Foster Brothers. In 1983, Foster Brothers was itself acquired by Sears Holdings plc. Adams had over two hundred stores by the 1980s, and by the 1990s, it had become a key player in the childrenswear market. The company opened its first international franchise in Saudi Arabia in 1997. Further international stores were then opened in Cyprus, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Finland, Malta, India and Slovakia. In January 1999, Sears was acquired by Philip Green, who then agreed to a management buy out of Adams Childrenswear. In August 2001, it was announced that Adams planned to double in size by 2005. =Mini Mode brand= Halifax in 2009 Adams has been making clothing under the Mini Mode brand for Boots since 2002. Mini Mode has 327 concessions, and its own online store. Mini Mode Childrenswear Limited also entered administration on 21 January 2009, with Rob Jonathan Hunt, Stuart David Maddison and Michael John Andrew Jervis being appointed as joint administrators. =Administration of 2006= In the end of 2006, Adams went into administration, with PricewaterhouseCoopers handling the proceedings. John Shannon bought Adams out of administration in February 2007. 42 of the stores were then closed. David Carter Johnson was appointed as chief executive. In January 2008, the \\"kids love fashion\\" branding was rolled out into all stores, and store refits started in the United Kingdom and Ireland. =Administration of 2008= During the weekend of 28 December 2008, Adams announced that were again preparing to enter administration at the same time with Woolworths, MFI and Zavvi. Stores that closed included; * Birmingham * Shrewsbury * Worcester * Walsall * Stourbridge * Wolverhampton * Kilburn * Hornsey * Chatham * Lichfield * Cirencester * Poole * Weymouth * Weston Super Mare * Redditch During the administration, there were 260 stores in the United Kingdom and 116 outlets overseas, employing around 2000 people. PricewaterhouseCoopers were approached on 24 December to act as administrators again. Adams was reported to owe around ¬£20 million to Mr Shannon, and ¬£10 million to Burdale. The company entered administration on 31 December 2008. The Mini Mode brand was not affected by the administration at this time. 111 stores closed, shedding 850 jobs, but the administrators remained hopeful that Adams would still find a buyer. 160 of the stores then remained. On 26 January, a further 36 stores were closed. 125 of the stores continued to trade, while the situation was assessed. =2009‚Äìpresent= On 15 February 2009, it was announced that former owner John Shannon, who also bought the company in 2007, would be taking it out of administration. The Adams brand would be retained. On 10 September 2009, it was announced that Adams was sold to a new an investment group under the name of Habib Alvi. On 22 January 2010, it went into administration for the third time. On 8 February 2010, it was announced that Mini Mode would no longer exist. Mothercare designed a completely new range called 'Miniclub' sold only in Boots stores. In the beginning of 2010, Adams closed their few remaining stores and orders from the website ceased.

Sir Richard Pearson (1731‚Äì1806) was a British naval officer who was captain of the ship HMS Serapis during the American Revolution. As a lieutenant in the East Indies he did well during the Seven Years' War, where he was severely wounded. He was subsequently unable to obtain a commission because his senior officers twice died before they could fulfil their promises. He finally obtained post rank as a captain in 1773. In 1779, in command of the Serapis, 44 guns, and escorting a large convoy from the Baltic, he was attacked off Flamborough Head by an American rebel squadron under John Paul Jones in the Bonhomme Richard, 42 guns. This famous action ended in Pearson surrendering the Serapis to Jones but not before his spirited defence had covered the escape of the valuable convoy. The Bonhomme Richard ended up sinking following the capture, forcing Jones to lose his own ship and return to port in Pearson's captured vessel.

As a result of his opposition to National Socialism in Germany, he was forced into early retirement for a short duration in 1933. He was a full at the University of Bonn, from 1936 to 1969. After World War II, he helped to establish the J√ºlich Research Center, and he was a state representative of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Education From 1918 to 1925, Weizel studied chemistry at the Georg-August-Universit√§t G√∂ttingen, the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, and the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg. He received his doctorate in physical chemistry at Heidelberg, under Max Trautz. He switched form chemistry to physics to work on the quantum mechanics of molecules as a fellow of the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft (NG; Emergency Association of German Science) at the Universit√§t Rostock. He completed his Habilitation in 1929.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Weizel. Career After Habilitation, Weizel worked briefly at Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik (BASF, Baden Aniline and Soda Factory) at Ludwigshafen. Then, during 1931, he had a Rockefeller fellowship to the University of Chicago.Walter Weizel The Broadening of the Resonance Atomic Line of Helium, Phys. Rev. Volume 38, 642 - 645 (1931). Received 12 June 1931. Institutional affiliation: Ryerson Physical Laboratory, University of Chicago. The author was cited as being a Fellow of the Rockfeller Foundation. From late in 1931, Weizel was an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of theoretical physics at the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe (today, the University of Karlsruhe). After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933, Weizel was temporarily forced into retirement due to his opposition to National Socialism. In 1936, he was called from the Technische Hochschule Karlsruhe to an ordinarius professorship at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn.John Bryant An Interview with Edward M. Purcell IEEE History Center (14 June 1991) On 1 December 1939, after more than four years of a selections process, due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty and both the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Education Ministry) and the supporters of deutsche Physik, Wilhelm Carl Gottlieb M√ºller was selected to succeed Arnold Sommerfeld in the chair for theoretical physics at the Ludwig- Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen. M√ºller was a supporter of deutsche Physik, which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. The appointment of Wilhelm M√ºller - who was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft Beyerchen, 1977, p. 166. - as a replacement for Sommerfeld, was considered such a travesty and detrimental to educating a new generation of physicists that both Ludwig Prandtl, director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Str√∂mungsforschung ( Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research), and Carl Ramsauer, director of the research division of the Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts- Gesellschaft (General Electric Company) and president of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, made reference to this in their correspondence to officials in the Reich. In an attachment to Prandtl‚Äôs 28 April 1941 letter to Reich Marshal Hermann G√∂ring, Prandtl referred to the appointment as ‚Äúsabotage‚Äù of necessary theoretical physics instruction.Hentschel, 1996, p. 265. Document #85 in Hentschel, 1996, pp. 261-266. In an attachment to Ramsauer‚Äôs 20 January 1942 letter to Reich Minister Bernhard Rust, Ramsauer concluded that the appointment amounted to the ‚Äúdestruction of the Munich theoretical physics tradition.‚ÄùHentschel, 1996, p. 291.

When M√ºller, as editor, published the document J√ºdische und deutsche Physik, Weizel published a very critical review of the booklet pointing out its inconsistencies; his review had the support of the Faculty of Science and Mathematics at the University of Bonn.Walter Weizel review of Wilhelm M√ºller, editor J√ºdische und Deutsche Physik.

He worked as a volunteer on Coleoptera at the South African Museum in 1882, and two years later became a member of the permanent staff. Shortly after he also took up an appointment as inspector-general of vineyards. At the age of 37 he married Bertha Marcellis. Three years later, in 1895, he was put in charge of the Invertebrate Collection, and in 1896 becoming assistant director of the Museum. When the post of Director fell vacant in 1906 following Sclater's resignation, the Board of Trustees had no hesitation in appointing P√©ringuey as director. In the same year he started delivering lectures in forest entomology at the S.A. College, and was awarded a doctorate in Natural Sciences by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. Despite financial stringencies, the Museum engaged in an active program of collecting, research and publication. A dearth of transport meant that collectors often had to travel by train, donkey-cart and ox-wagon. He made important contributions in the field of physical anthropology, and produced a set of plaster casts of the San to record their physical appearance. An overcrowded museum made expansion necessary, but the outbreak of World War I stopped all construction. P√©ringuey persuaded the authorities to purchase four old corrugated iron buildings in 1922, which subsequently served as store rooms. P√©ringuey was powerfully built and tall, dynamic and strong-willed. He had an enormous capacity for work, and a prodigious memory, but was also short- tempered and obstinate, with a great distrust of academics. His dislike of Germans led to his naming the genus Bochus in the family Gryllacrididae, and the type species contemnendus (i.e. 'contemptible German'). When the family was revised many years later by an Austrian authority, the taxon was found to be a synonym of B. puncticeps, translating as 'the German with the pointy head'.P√©ringuey, Louis Albert (1855-1924) Museums of Cape Townsynonym Bochus contemnendus P√©ringuey, 1916 systematics of Southern African Anostostomatidae (Orthoptera) based on morphological and molecular data June 2006 On 20 February 1924, aged 69, P√©ringuey died near the Museum while walking home. He wrote Descriptive catalogue of the coleoptera of South Africa (1897) and many short scientific papers describing new taxa. His collections are divided between the Iziko South African Museum, Transvaal Museum, Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova and the collections of the German Entomological Institute.

It was witnessed by his sister-in-law, possibly by his secretary Karl Holz, and by his close friend Anselm H√ºttenbrenner, who provided a vivid description of the event. Beethoven's funeral was held three days later, and the procession was witnessed by a large crowd. He was originally buried in the cemetery at W√§hring, although his remains were moved in 1888 to the Vienna Central Cemetery.. H√ºttenbrenner's account has been used to ascribe motivations of resistance and anger to Beethoven in his final moments. Beethoven's last words and the exact cause of his death have also been the subject of some historical debate. Final illness Plaque at Schwarzspanierstra√üe 15 Beethoven suffered declining health throughout the last years of his life, including the so- called \\"Late period\\" when he produced some of his most admired work. The last work he was able to complete was the substitute final movement of the String Quartet No. 13, Op. 130, composed to replace the difficult Gro√üe Fuge, which was published separately as Opus 133. Shortly thereafter, in late 1826, illness struck again, with episodes of vomiting and diarrhea that nearly ended his life. As it became apparent that Beethoven would not recover, his friends gathered to help and to pay their final respects. Beethoven's doctors conducted four minor operations to relieve ascites (abdominal swelling), of which the first resulted in infection, the others not. On 24 March he was given his last rites, and on 26 March he slipped into unconsciousness and died early that evening. While others, including Beethoven's brother Johann, Karl Holz and some friends were probably in the house, H√ºttenbrenner reports in his account given in 1860, that only he and Beethoven's sister-in-law were present in the room at the time of death. =Final words= Beethoven's last recorded words were \\"Pity, pity‚Äîtoo late!\\", as the dying composer was told of a gift of twelve bottles of wine from his publisher. One common belief was that his last words were (\\"Applaud, my friends, the comedy is over\\"), the typical conclusion to performances of Italian Commedia dell'arte; this was specifically denied by H√ºttenbrenner in 1860. Another invention is that his last words were, \\"I shall hear in heaven,\\" apropos his deafness. Beethoven biographer Alexander Wheelock Thayer, in his notebook, recorded H√ºttenbrenner's account of Beethoven's death. H√ºttenbrenner's eyewitness report is sometimes recast to imply that Beethoven \\"shook his fist at the heavens\\" in the moment before death. Since any imputations as to the dying man's emotional state are impossible to verify, they tend to be glossed over or ignored as irrelevant by modern Beethoven scholars. Autopsy and post-mortem findings Death mask by Josef Dannhauser An autopsy was performed on 27 March 1827 by Dr. Johann Wagner. While it is unclear who ordered the autopsy, a specific request by Beethoven in his Heiligenstadt Testament may have played a role in the decision. The autopsy revealed a severely cirrhotic and shrunken liver, of which ascites is a common consequence. Scholars disagree over whether Beethoven's liver damage was the result of heavy alcohol consumption, hepatic infection, or both. Hepatitis B and C are causes of cirrhosis, but they spread from contact with contaminated body fluids and were extremely rare in Beethoven's day. Hepatitis A on the other hand can be contracted from food and water that were not handled properly and was very common in the 19th century, although it does not cause liver cirrhosis or permanent organ damage. Heavy metal contamination is thought to be a contributing factor in Beethoven's death as these were commonly used in medicines of the time. It has also been theorized that he consumed large amounts of lead from illegally fortified wine. Putting lead sugar into wine was a very common practice to sweeten cheap wines, and despite being outlawed in most European countries during the 18th century, the prohibition was difficult to enforce and production of lead-fortified wine (which originated in Roman times) continued unabated. There is no indication the composer had syphilis beyond a mercury treatment prescribed to him around 1815, but these were used for various other ailments as well. The autopsy indicated damage to his aural nerves as well as hardening of their accompanying arteries, although the latter appears to be consistent with natural aging and not inflammatory damage from syphilis. Beethoven's brain was described as possessing \\"exaggerated folds\\", an excess of fluid in the skull, and some thickening of the membranes inside the left ventricle. Scholars believe he may have had a degree of cerebral atrophy, although he showed no sign of cognitive impairment to the end. The skull was described as \\"possessing unusual thickness\\". Beethoven's kidneys had calcareous growths in them, indicating that he was likely developing renal papillary necrosis (RPN), a common result of analgesic abuse (it is known that he used large amounts of various drugs obtained from his brother Johann, an apothecary). Diabetes is also a cause of RPN, and scholars have not ruled out the possibility that the composer had diabetes mellitus. His spleen was swollen to twice the normal size and he had portal hypertension, both consistent with end-stage liver failure. He also appears to have had severe pancreatitis, as the doctors described his pancreas as \\"shrunken and fibrous\\", with the exit duct being very thin and narrowed. Large amounts of reddish fluid had accumulated in Beethoven's abdomen, likely from spontaneous bacterial infections mixed with some blood. This was possibly a result of draining fluid from his abdomen in his last days, a practice that frequently caused infection and often death of the patient in a time before antibiotics and bacterial pathology were known. In the days immediately preceding and following his death, a number of people, including Anton Schindler and Ferdinand Hiller, cut locks of hair from Beethoven's head. Most of Hiller's lock is now in the Center for Beethoven Studies at San Jose State University. One of Beethoven's friends incorrectly thought that \\"strangers had cut all of his hair off\\"; in fact, the apparent lack of hair was due to a cloth cap that covered most of the hair while the body was lying in state. On 28 March 1827, castings for a death mask were taken. The body was washed, clothed and placed in an oaken coffin, with the head given a wreath of white roses. Beethoven's hands held a wax cross and a lily. In 1970, Dr. John Spencer Madden, editor of the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism, wrote a post-mortem analysis. This post-mortem became well known by being referenced by a short comical essay by the humorist Alan Coren entitled \\"Careful, Mr. Beethoven, that was your fifth!\\" Funeral and burial Beethoven's grave The funeral was held on 29 March 1827 at the parish church in Alsergrund, and he was buried in the W√§hring cemetery, northwest of Vienna. Many thousands of citizens lined the streets for the funeral procession. As with all crowds, estimates vary, with witnesses reporting anywhere from 10,000 to 30,000 onlookers. Theaters were closed, and many notable artists participated in the funeral procession as pallbearers or torch bearers, including Johann Nepomuk Hummel,\\" Johann Nepomuk Hummel\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Franz Grillparzer who wrote an eulogy,\\"Ludwig van Beethoven's Funeral Oration\\", lvbeethoven.com Carl Czerny, and Franz Schubert. At a memorial mass in a Vienna church on 3 April, Mozart's Requiem was sung with an additional Libera me by Ignaz von Seyfried. In the days following the funeral, one of the grave-diggers was reportedly offered a substantial sum of money to remove the head from the grave. As a result, Beethoven's friends had a watch put on the grave. In 1863 Beethoven's body (and also that of Schubert, who was buried nearby) was exhumed, studied and reburied, in proceedings paid for by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. At that time, fragments from the back of his skull, which had been separated during the autopsy, were acquired by the Austrian doctor Romeo Seligmann, which are also now in the Center for Beethoven Studies. His remains were moved in 1888 to the Vienna Central Cemetery. Lead poisoning overdose There is dispute about the cause of Beethoven's death; alcoholic cirrhosis, syphilis, infectious hepatitis, lead poisoning, sarcoidosis, and Whipple's disease have all been proposed. In 2008, Austrian pathologist Christian Reiter asserted that Beethoven's doctor, Andreas Wawruch, accidentally killed him by giving him an overdose of a lead- based cure. According to Reiter, Wawruch used the cure to alleviate fluid in the abdomen; the lead penetrated Beethoven's liver and killed him. Reiter's hypothesis however is at odds with Dr. Wawruch's written instruction \\"that the wound was kept dry all the time\\". Furthermore, human hair is a very bad biomarker for lead contamination, and Reiter's hypothesis must be considered dubious as long as proper scholarly documentation remains unpublished. In 2010, Dr. Andrew C. Todd tested two pieces of Beethoven's skull for lead, and determined that the concentration of lead was no greater than would be expected for a normal man of 56 at that time.\\"Beethoven May Not Have Died of Lead Poisoning, After All\\" by James Barron, The New York Times, 28 May 2010 However, a later study by Dr. Tim White at U.C. Berkeley determined that the tested skull fragments were not Beethoven's. The leading cause of death still remains lead poisoning, however. Among other evidence, the finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.

Crane Generating Station was a 400 megawatt (MW) coal power plant located on the Carroll Island Road in Bowleys Quarters, Maryland, east of Baltimore. The power plant was operated by C.P. Crane, LLC, a subsidiary of Avenue Capital Group. The station had two coal-fired generating units, rated at 190 and 209 MW nominal capacity, and powered by cyclone steam boilers. It also had a 16 MW oil-fired combustion turbine. The Crane station occupies on the Middle River Neck Peninsula adjacent to the Seneca Creek tributary of the Gunpowder River, and is on the rural side of the Baltimore County Urban Rural Demarcation Line. The plant was closed in June 2018. Coal delivery Coal was delivered to the generating station by a dedicated rail spur used by the Norfolk Southern Railway that connects to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line. Regulatory approval to construct facilities allowing delivery by barge using a dredged channel from the Chesapeake Bay was granted in 2006. The cyclone boilers required the use of medium-sulfur, low-fusion coal, which was supplied mainly using North Appalachian Pittsburgh Seam 8 coal. The station used approximately 950,000 tons of coal each year. History The two cyclone boiler units were originally oil-fired. Unit 1 went into operation in 1961 and unit 2 in 1963. These two units were modified to use coal as their primary fuel following an order by the Department of Energy under the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974. The station was named for Charles P. Crane, who from 1950 to 1957 was president of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, the predecessor company of Constellation Energy, and its chairman from 1955 to 1961. =2012 sale= On August 9, 2012, Exelon announced that it had reached an agreement, subject to regulatory approvals, for the sale of the Charles P. Crane, Brandon Shores, and Herbert A. Wagner Generating Stations to Raven Power Holdings LLC, a newly formed portfolio company of Riverstone Holdings LLC. Exelon had committed to divest the plants as condition for regulatory approval of its merger with Constellation Energy to alleviate concerns regarding potential market power in the regional wholesale electricity market.

In 2013, it became known as Newman-Chancellor Industries, following the death of Katherine Chancellor and the merger of Newman Enterprises and Chancellor Industries until Chancellor Industries was sold to Jill Abbott and Cane Ashby in 2015. After that, it was briefly known as Newman-Abbott Enterprises following a merger with Jabot Cosmetics, until the merger was undone and the two companies separated, making it Newman Enterprises once again. =Newman Enterprises= Newman Enterprises was a worldwide conglomerate founded in 1980 by Victor Newman, following his departure from Chancellor Industries. The company operated with three divisions: Real Estate, Cosmetics and Venture Capital; and numerous subsidiaries. Throughout the company's history, its main rival has been Jabot Cosmetics. For years, Newman's chief rival in the cosmetics industry was Jabot Cosmetics but after it went public Victor bought up most of the stock and acquired the company. For years Victor was chairman of the board and CEO with Jack Abbott, Brad Carlton, Jill Foster Abbott, Ashley Abbott, and Neil Winters all serving as underlings. Jack, Brad, and Neil served as coCEO but only short term as Victor always intended to pass Newman Enterprises on to his children. This caused longtime employee Neil Winters to resign and become CEO of Chancellor Industries. For years Victor as chairman and CEO ruthlessly ran Newman Enterprises and made it one of the largest and most successful conglomerates in the world. Both Victoria and Nicholas worked their way up at Newman Enterprises to eventually become board members and CEO's respectively. After the death of Victor's ex-wife Hope Wilson Victor invited his younger son Victor Adam Newman, Jr. to come work at Newman Enterprises. Adam was a Harvard-educated Wall Street stockbroker and inherited much of Victor's business savvy but his ambition and jealousy put him at odds with Victor and his siblings but Adam served briefly as chairman of the board and CEO and managed to retain a seat on the board after Newman Enterprises went public. For years Newman Enterprises was a private company but after his daughters Victoria and Abby and eldest son Nicholas successfully sued Victor for $1.5 billion Victor took the company public. Despite this Victor forgave his children and they have returned to work at Newman Enterprises. Since the lawsuit, there have been many changes in Newman Enterprises in terms of CEO. When Victor was jailed, Adam Newman took on the roll of CEO, but Victor later returned. A few months later, Victor disappeared because of mental health issues, and his then-wife, Sharon Newman took over the roll of CEO out of revenge towards the Newmans, mainly Victor, Nicholas, Victoria, Abby, Adam and Nikki. A court ruling made Victoria Newman acting CEO while Sharon underwent court ordered psychological evaluation, but the decision was reversed soon after. Sharon's tenure as CEO saw stocks at Newman plummet, but her term ended once Victor returned alive retaking control of his company. Due to the plummet in stocks, Tucker McCall conspired with Jack Abbott in a hostile takeover to control Newman Enterprises. They purchased significant stock. With Tucker's support, Jack was successful in his bid to become CEO. Jack fired Victor, Victoria, and Nicholas as he planned to change the face of the company by renaming it \\"Abbott Enterprises\\". Jack became addicted to painkillers but covered-up with help from Adam Newman. Jack resigned as CEO and Adam convinced the board to appoint him CEO. Victor began plotting a takeover but when Adam was shot defending Victor they agreed to work together. Adam raises enough money from an anonymous source to buy out the remaining stockholders and the Newmans retake complete control of Newman Enterprises. Victor discovers that Adam's secret investor that allowed the Newmans to retake control of Newman Enterprises was Jack Abbott; this causes a rift between Victor and Adam in which Adam signs over his shares in the company to Victor. Upon the death of Victor's close friend Katherine Chancellor, Victor inherits majority ownership of Chancellor Industries and immediately plans a merger between Chancellor Industries and Newman Enterprises with Victoria heading the project. The new company emerged with the name Newman-Chancellor Industries. =Divisions= * Brash and Sassy Cosmetics * Newman Energy ** Drilling ** Transportation ** Refining and marketing * Newman Real Estate ** \\"Castle Properties\\" ** \\"Gerolamo Limited\\" * Newman Venture Capitals ** \\"Ra-Tech\\" ** \\"Granville Global\\" ** \\"NVP Retreats\\" =Personnel=Current personnel * Linda Helgesson (member of the board of directors) * Abby Newman (shareholder, member of the board of directors; former chief operating officer) * Nicholas Newman (shareholder, member of the board of directors; former co-chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief executive officer, and executive) * Nikki Newman (member of the board of directors) * Summer Newman (intern) * Victor Newman (founder; chief executive officer (CEO); chairman of the board) * Victoria Newman (shareholder, member of the board of directors; former chief executive officer (CEO); former chief operating officer, and president of Brash & Sassy; formerly worked in the mailroom) * Natalie Soderberg (executive assistant) * Grace Turner (executive) ¬∑ Former personnel * Bob Adams (former member of the board of directors) * Billy Abbott (former acting co-CEO) * Jack Abbott (former CEO) * Kyle Abbott (former executive) * Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (former member of the board of directors) * Michael Baldwin (former general counsel) * Brad Carlton (former chief operating officer, executive, member of the board of directors and chief executive officer) * Colleen Carlton (former member of the board of directors) * Avery Bailey Clark (former chief legal counsel) * Melanie Daniels (legal counsel) * Curtis Fielding (former member of the board of directors) * Devon Hamilton (former intern) * JT Hellstrom (former director of security) * Davis Holloway (former member of the board of directors) * Diane Jenkins (former architect, consultant and member of the board of directors) * Tucker McCall (former member of the board of directors) * Ryan McNeil (former assistant to Victor Newman; formerly worked at Brash & Sassy, Newman Men's Line and mailroom) * Carmen Mesta (former public relations officer) * Adam Newman (former shareholder, member of the board of directors; former CEO of Chelsea 2.0, co-chief executive officer, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, Junior vice president, executive) * Chelsea Newman (former executive; in charge of Chelsea 2.0) * Noah Newman (former intern) * Alex Perez (former general counsel) * Daniel Romalotti (former Intern) * Luca Santori (former shareholder, former executive) * Marisa Sierras (former executive assistant) * Mitchell Sherman (former general counsel) * John Silva (former general counsel) * Phyllis Summers (former director of Internet affairs and vice president of research and development) * Karen Taylor (former director of marketing and director of Consolidated Cosmetics Division) * Sage Warner (former executive at Chelsea 2.0) * Connie Wayne (Victor's former secretary) * Mason Wilder (former executive assistant to Jack Abbott and Adam Newman) * Christine Blair Williams (former general counsel) * Drucilla Winters (former director of Consolidated Cosmetics Division) * Neil Winters (former chief executive officer and member of the board of directors; former chief operation officer and mentor to Drucilla Winters; former acting chief executive officer and corporate liaison) The Newman ranch Victor and his wife at the time, Julia Newman, bought the Newman ranch from Katherine Chancellor in 1980.

Four criminals known to the police and a former Channel 7 (now WHDH-TV) Boston television investigative news anchorman, Jack Kelly, were killed, allegedly over the sale of cocaine. Suspected robbery and aftermath Three gunmen had burst into Blackfriars, a Downtown Boston bar located at 105 Summer Street. The Irish themed pub was named after Blackfriars which was mentioned in William Shakespeare's play Henry VIII. John A. Kelly of Framingham, Massachusetts, the club manager, was found lying face-down, two gunshot wounds in the head, in the cramped, blood-spattered subterranean basement, along with the bodies of Charles Magarian of North Andover, Massachusetts, Peter Meroth of Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Freddie Delavega of Somerville and Vincent E. Solomonte of Quincy, Massachusetts, who was the club's owner. The men had been killed while in the middle of a game of backgammon that had started up after the disco closed for the night. The bullet-riddled corpses were discovered by the janitor when he came in for work. Investigators suspected that the five men were surprised at around 2:00 a.m., and herded into the office where they were all shot by one or more intruders wielding at least one shotgun and a .25 caliber semi-automatic pistol. At the scene, investigators discovered a small arsenal of firearms and small quantities of cocaine and marijuana, as well as $15,000 in loose cash in an open safe. The drugs and cash led the police to conclude that the motive behind the massacre was not a robbery. The prevailing police opinion was that it looked to be a classic gangland style slaying. The massacre allegedly was over several kilos of cocaine. One of the murder victims, Vincent E. Solomonte, was later discovered to be a close associate and friend of Winter Hill Gang member Stephen Flemmi. The homicide investigators concluded that the five men were all murdered \\"gangland style.\\" Kelly was survived by his wife and four young children.  Victims  *Vincent Solmonte, age 35, owner of the Blackfriars Pub *Peter Meroth, age 31, of the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston *Freddy Delavega, 34, of Somerville; *Charles Magarian, 37, of North Andover; *John ‚ÄúJack‚Äù Kelly, 34, a journalist who worked as a night manager of the pub. Kelly had formerly been employed as an investigative reporter for WBZ news radio and WNAC-TV (Channel 7). Suspects The Boston Police Department suspected the responsibility of the murders to be orchestrated by one or some of these suspects: *James J. \\"Whitey\\" Bulger, of Somerville, Massachusetts, leader of the Winter Hill Gang, a mostly Irish-American crime family operating in the region of Boston, Massachusetts who was a Top Echelon Informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). *Stephen \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi, of Roxbury, Massachusetts, former member of the Winter Hill Gang and ex-top echelon informant for the FBI. *Nicholas Femia, of East Boston, Massachusetts, associate of the Patriarca crime family and later the Winter Hill Gang who was involved in extortion and armed robbery. *James Martorano, contract killer and associate of the Winter Hill Gang and later the Patriarca crime family who was a close friend of Kelly. *Robert Italiano of East Boston, Massachusetts. *William N. Ierardi, drug dealer from Lynn, Massachusetts. Targets The main targets that were the intended reason for the murders were John A. Kelly and/or his business partner and friend, Vincent E. Solomonte. The victim, bar manager John A. Kelly, is not to be mistaken for DEA agent John Kelly, friend of FBI Special Agent John Connolly, or Patriarca crime family mob associate John (\\"Red\\") Kelley who were all active at the same time in the Boston underworld. Maurice Lewis, a lifelong friend of Kelly, stated, > I always thought of him as suitable for the cast of The Wild Bunch.... He > was born a little too late for the adventure he craved. He was attracted to > mobsters like a moth to a candle. Early on, he found a beat that would set > him apart from the rest. He started to cultivate mob contacts as a way of > getting into investigative reporting back before it became fashionable. And > he loved that movie image. I don‚Äôt think he ever thought of it as anything > other than a movie. But it was very real, and he just kept getting in deeper > and deeper. Although he was fired over a political scandal with city hall, co-workers thought that Kelly was on the verge of making a comeback to the world of investigative journalism. According to former colleague Maurice Lewis, Kelly was scheduled to give up his job as manager of The Blackfriars Pub in two to three weeks in order to begin work as a freelance producer at WLVI-TV, Channel 56. His first pilot was scheduled to be taped on July 14 of that year. He also spoke of buying a bar or restaurant and managing it himself. While he managed Blackfriars for Solomonte, he hired Stephen Flemmi's longtime mistress Marilyn DeSilva to work at the popular discoth√®que as a waitress. Kelly, as a Channel 7 investigative reporter, in a November 1976 interview, said, > I suppose my role with those people (organized-crime figures) is a dual role > in a sense. I went into the relationship looking for stories. If you want a > story on a gangster, go to a cop. If you want a story on a cop, go to a > gangster. I went into that situation for that reason, and I suppose I came > away with more. =Kelly's alleged criminal associations= Mel Bernstein, who was WNAC-TV's news director, stated that Kelly was an admirer of Edward Francis Harrington, former head of the New England Organized Crime Task Force and the United States Attorney in Boston, and says it was Harrington who first suggested to Kelly that if he really wanted to do investigative reporting he ought to develop underworld contacts. \\"It's true that he kind of relished those associations... but he always maintained that those relationships were there because he needed sources. I accepted that only on the basis of who he was and what his job was. Every reporter has to have his sources.\\" Police Commissioner diGrazia informed reporters after the scandal at city hall that there was a witch hunt-type campaign to get Mayor Kevin White. His office's public relations workers were covertly leaking information on Kelly to reporters they considered cooperative. Soon after Chief diGrazia leveled his charges, The Boston Globe released an investigative article that revealed a police report indicating that John Kelly had been seen by law enforcement officials \\"in the company of known members of organized crime\\" on roughly 25 separate occasions. When firearms and cocaine were found at the scene of the massacre, allegations and speculations of Kelly being an active member in Boston's organized crime came to light. John Kelly's friend and fellow co-worker Maurice Lewis later commented to The Boston Phoenix that there was no evidence that Kelly had been profiting from drug deals, though he stated that at the very least Kelly was a fringe member of organized crime. Lewis said, > He had no new car and no new clothes. He was driving a gold Cadillac > Eldorado, but it was about three years old and it wasn‚Äôt his. It was Vinny's > (victim Vincent E. Solomonte), and it was all beaten up. Jack never hid > anything. If he were a big drug dealer, he‚Äôd let the world know. Jack ain‚Äôt > gonna be wearing moccasins if he can be wearing $150 shoes. And he left home > wearing moccasins that morning. Investigation Retired corrupt FBI Special Agent Michael J. Buckley said in court that he told FBI Special Agent John Connolly that Ierardi later admitted that he had fabricated the involvement of Bulger and Flemmi in the unsolved massacre. =Nicholas Femia= Suspect Nicholas Femia was a hulking, overweight man with a cocaine addiction who wore flashy, flamboyant clothing and had a troubled relationship with James J. Bulger, with whom he had become an associate through the Winter Hill Gang in 1976. Nicholas lived with a girlfriend of Stephen Flemmi's mistress, Marilyn DeSilva, in an apartment across the street from Chandler's Restaurant, a South End restaurant co-owned by Martorano. He first began as a career criminal under the tutelage of Joseph Barboza. Nicholas was introduced into the gang to assist with extra muscle for their extortion and \\"protection\\" rackets. When suspect Nicholas Femia began hanging around the Winter Hill Gang's current headquarters, Lancaster Foreign Motors garage, James J. Bulger wanted it established that Nicholas had nothing whatsoever to do with the massacre, although his involvement is considered highly suspect by law enforcement circles. Bulger did this to reduce any pending surveillance and subpoenas or investigations by ambitious policemen who would try to prosecute Bulger because of his association with a high profile suspected killer like Nicholas. Soon after Nicholas joined the Winter Hill Gang, a brief notice appeared in one of FBI Special Agent John Connolly's reports clearing Nicholas of any involvement in the Blackfriar's massacre. As James J. Bulger grew older, he became more obsessed with physical fitness. James often wore tight jeans and T-shirts, and grew increasingly disgusted with Nicholas's protruding gut. Later, after Bulger and Nicholas parted ways, Connolly put another report in Bulger's file, suggesting that Nicholas had in fact been one of the triggermen in the Blackfriars killings. Nicholas would later remain under police surveillance for an assortment of crimes until he was shot to death during the unsuccessful shakedown of an autobody shop on Condor Street, East Boston, in 1983. Femia remains one of the suspects in the massacre, but his involvement has yet been proven. Murder trials and outcomes Suspects Robert Italiano and William N. Ierardi, two suspects who were concentrated on by authorities during the initial homicide investigation, were later tried and acquitted in court in 1978. The massacre remains unsolved. Even though the crime was never officially solved, it is documented as being connected to organized crime. The Blackfriar murders is featured on Boston.com as a \\"Mob Tour\\" attraction. As for the individual suspects, they faced different fates: * James J. \\"Whitey\\" Bulger ‚Äì On August 19, 1999, became the 458th Ten Most Wanted fugitive listed by the FBI, wanted for racketeering under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 19 counts of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, money laundering, conspiracy to commit money laundering and narcotics distribution. On June 22, 2011, after sixteen years on the run, he was arrested. * Nicholas Femia ‚Äì After Nicholas and James J. Bulger parted ways, FBI Special Agent John Connolly put another report in Bulger's file, suggesting that Nicholas had in fact been one of the triggermen in the Blackfriars killings. His involvement in the Blackfriars massacre was never successfully proven and remains unsolved. Nicholas would be recognized as one of the few associates in the Winter Hill Gang that were able to part from the group and not be murdered in retribution for something foul for their actions, like Richard Castucci and Louis Litif. Femia would later be shot to death during an alleged robbery of an auto body shop in East Boston on December 16, 1983. His killer was the owner of the shop. There was a question as to whether Femia intended to actually rob the shop since the police report of the incident stated Femia was sitting next to a desk in the office of the shop when he was shot execution style. He was 43 years old at the time of his death. * Stephen Flemmi ‚Äì Starting in 1999, he turned state's evidence and gave evidence which helped lead to the arrests and convictions of Winter Hill Gang associate Kevin Weeks, former childhood friend Frank Salemme and FBI handlers John Connolly and H. Paul Rico. * James Martorano ‚Äì The brother of John Martorano, he would later align himself with the Patriarca crime family and be promoted to the rank of caporegime. In 1995 he was convicted of racketeering, extortion and conspiracy to commit murder. * William N. Ierardi ‚Äì He was convicted of drug dealing in 1987 and turned state's evidence in trial of Stephen Flemmi and others. Other The Blackfriars Pub itself is long gone. The Summer Street building in the Church Green Buildings Historic District that once held the pub now houses office space and retail stores such as Dunkin' Donuts.

Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 137, accessed 27 Dec 2008 one of the first African-American Baptist congregations in the United States, and one of the oldest black churches in the nation.Henry Chase, \\"Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free slaves\\", American Visions, Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 Dec 2008 It established one of the first local schools for black children in the nation. Its congregation was active during the 20th century Civil Rights Movement. Today it has the largest community outreach program in the city. History In the earliest decades of the Baptist Church in the American Southeast, it was stimulated by preachers from New England who generated the Great Awakening. As more churches were started, members came together in an association. With growth through the end of the American Revolutionary War, in 1781 the association of churches split into two parts: along state lines for Virginia and North Carolina. The twenty-one congregations in Virginia formed the Portsmouth Baptist Association, named after their first meeting place. Representatives worked together to form church policy. From 1810 to 1828 they began to work on Foreign Missions and Christian Education. Later they established Sabbath Schools.\\"History of the Portsmouth Baptist Association\\", Official website, accessed 31 Dec 2008 The history of First Baptist Church started with scattered black members in Prince George County, Virginia worshipping as New Lights in 1756 after the Great Awakening. Baptist preachers had traveled widely in the South where they appealed to both blacks and whites in evangelical outreach. In the early years, such preachers strongly supported an anti-slavery message, based on the equality of men made in God's image. Their democratic message and willingness to welcome blacks in active roles attracted many new members to the Baptists, including slaves. At a time when the Anglican Church was the established church in the colony, in some areas energetic young white men without many other opportunities were the ones to take up leadership roles as Baptist preachers, and they challenged the class system of the colony. In 1774 some of the black New Light members united under the Rev. John Michaels. Calling themselves the First African Baptist Church, they met in Lunenburg in a building on the plantation of Colonel William Byrd III. After their meetinghouse at the Byrd plantation burned in a fire, in 1820 free members of the congregation moved to Petersburg, Virginia, where there was a growing free black community. (From about 300 free blacks in 1790, this community in Petersburg grew tenfold to 3,224 by 1860, when it was the largest free black population in the South.\\"National Register Nominations: Pocahontas Island Historic District\\" , Heritage Matters, Jan-Feb 2008, National Park Service, accessed 30 Dec 2008 On the eve of the Civil War, city residents also included about 6,000 enslaved African Americans and 9,000 whites.) With the move into Petersburg, the congregation took the name of First Baptist Church. They built their first church on Harrison Avenue (near the location of the current church.) This was one of two early black Baptist churches in the colonies before the American Revolutionary War; this was the first Baptist church to be established in Petersburg. Emphasizing education, the First Baptist congregation also created one of the earliest local schools for black children in the nation. From its beginning, the congregation was led by black pastors. In the wake of Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831, however, planters became so alarmed about the potential for religious messages to cause other revolts that they passed legislation in 1832 requiring that all black churches be led by white pastors. The planters believed they could ensure control of the message that whites would deliver. During this time, Thomas G. Keen was one of the ministers at First Baptist. After the Civil War, blacks took back control of their church and left the Southern Baptist Convention. By 1865 First Baptist had 1700 members. Rev. Leonard A. Black was pastor from 1873 to 1883, during which time the congregation grew to 3,600 members. At about age 17, he had escaped from slavery in Maryland in 1837, joining three brothers in Boston, Massachusetts and settling that year in Portland, Maine. He later married and lived for years in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1847 he had published a memoir of his trials and journey, The Life and Sufferings of Leonard Black, a Fugitive from Slavery, classified as a slave narrative.Monique Prince, \\"Summary: Leonard Black, The Life and Sufferings of Leonard Black, a Fugitive from Slavery. Written by Himself, New Bedford: Benjamin Lindsey, 1847\\", Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina First Baptist soon joined a state convention of black Baptist churches, aided by the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, to escape the supervision of whites. Such black state conventions eventually founded the National Baptist Convention, USA. The First Baptist congregation continued to grow after the war as numerous freedmen moved to Petersburg from outlying areas. Its members helped the rural migrants adjust to urban life. The current church at 236 Harrison Avenue was built starting in 1870, after a fire burned the previous one. The congregation steadily added to the church, completing the steeple during Rev. Black's pastorate. First Baptist Church Petersburg, Virginia, Official website, accessed 27 Dec 2008The Life and Sufferings of Leonard Black, a Fugitive from Slavery.

Its congregation was active in the Civil Rights Movement, and the church was a place of mass meetings for demonstrations, support and voter registration. In 1980 First Baptist built a new education building, and it has purchased nearby lots as part of planning for its future. It is an active leader in the downtown association of churches, with the largest community outreach program in the city. Its ministries include education and scholarship programs, welfare and family counseling. In addition, it televises services twice a week.

Based on an Aesop's fable of the same name, it won the 1934 Oscar for Best Short Subject: Cartoons. This cartoon is also believed to be one of the inspirations for Bugs Bunny, who first appeared in 1940.Barrier (2003), p. 359-362  Plot Max Hare is the heavy favorite to win a major sporting event---he's cocky, athletic and incredibly fast. His challenger, Toby Tortoise, is teased and jeered for being sluggish and clumsy. He does seem to have the ability to stretch, which comes in handy in certain situations. Max tells Toby that he intends to play fair, but it seems obvious that Max is just out to humiliate his competition. The race begins and Max zooms off. It takes an extra nudge from the starter to get Toby going. Max seems to dominate the race, zooming past everything on the road. At one point, possibly as a homage to the fable, Max pretends to nap under a tree, just to watch Toby's progress. Thinking that Max really is asleep, Toby quietly creeps past him. Not long after, Max gets up and bolts past him again. A little further down the road, Max passes a girls' school, and stops to talk to the female bunnies. As Toby lumbers past, the girls invite him to stop as well, but Toby politely declines their offer, as he's committed to finishing the race. Even though Toby's now in the lead, Max opts to stay for a while, as he's confident that he'll have no trouble catching up with Toby because of how slow he is. Max uses the girls' sports field to show off his amazing athletic skills in archery, baseball and tennis. Just then, Max hears the crowd cheering and sees that Toby is not far from the finish line. He bids the girls farewell and charges off, still confident that he will win easily. Toby sees Max catching up and picks up his pace by stretching his legs. In the end, the race is close. Max crosses the finish line and skids to a rough halt. Once he gets up and dusts himself off, he realizes that he lost by a \\"neck's length.\\" The crowd rushes to congratulate the winner: Toby Tortoise.

The blue line is the secondary flow that pushes the tea leaves to the middle of the bottom. Albert Einstein solved the paradox in 1926. Visualization of secondary flow in river bend model (A.Ya.Milovich, 1913,His results are cited in: Reprinted in: flow from right to left). Near-bottom streamlines are marked with dye injected by a pipette. The tea leaf paradox is a phenomenon where tea leaves in a cup of tea migrate to the center and bottom of the cup after being stirred rather than being forced to the edges of the cup, as would be expected in a spiral centrifuge. The correct physical explanation of the paradox was for the first time given by James Thomson in 1857. He correctly connected the appearance of secondary flow (in both Earth atmosphere and tea cup) with ‚Ä≥friction on the bottom‚Ä≥.James Thomson, On the grand currents of atmospheric circulation (1857). Collected Papers in Physics and Engineering, Cambridge Univ., 1912, 144-148 djvu file The formation of secondary flows in an annular channel was theoretically treated by Boussinesq as early as in 1868. The migration of near-bottom particles in river-bend flows was experimentally investigated by A. Ya. Milovich in 1913. The solution first came from Albert Einstein in a 1926 paper in which he explained the erosion of river banks, and repudiated Baer's law. English translation: The Cause of the Formation of Meanders in the Courses of Rivers and of the So-Called Baer‚Äôs Law, accessed 2017-12-12.  Explanation  Stirring the liquid causes a spiral flow schema by centrifugal action. As such, the anticipation is that tea leaves would, because of their mass, move to the edge of the cup. However, friction between moving water and the cup increases water pressure, resulting in a high pressure boundary layer. This increase in pressure extends inwards and exceeds the mass of the tea leaves' inertia, which move outward by centrifugal action. Friction therefore produces a centripetal force upon the mass of tea leaves. This boundary layer causes a secondary flow schema, ultimately resulting in a spiral. The primary flow schema, caused by the stirring, forces water outward and up the edge of the cup. Then, under increasing pressure, water moves downward, inward and then upward, about the centre (see diagram). In this way, the secondary flow schema exerts an inward force upon the mass of the tea leaves (which exceeds their mass), which effectively contains their outward tendency, and causes the observable paradox. Incidentally, the circular movement of water is slower at the bottom of the cup than at the top, because the friction surface at the bottom is greater. This difference 'twists' the moving body of water into a spiral.  Applications  The phenomenon has been used to develop a new technique to separate red blood cells from blood plasma, to understand atmospheric pressure systems, and in the process of brewing beer to separate out coagulated trub in the whirlpool.

On 8 January 2003 at 20:19 EET (18:19 UTC), the aircraft operating the flight, a British Aerospace Avro RJ100, struck the ground on final approach approximately short of the runway threshold during inclement weather conditions. In the following collision with a slope, a post-crash fire broke out, killing 75 of the 80 occupants, including both pilots. BackgroundAircraft= The aircraft involved in the accident was a 1993-built British Aerospace Avro RJ100 with manufacturer serial number E3241. Owned by Trident Jet (Dublin) Limited, it was equipped with four Lycoming LF507-1F turbofan engines and was delivered to the airline in March 1994. At the time of the accident, it had accumulated a total of 20,000 flight hours in a total of 17,000 flight cycles. =Crew and passengers= The aircrew consisted of two pilots and three flight attendants. Captain Alaaddin Yunuk, a former Turkish Air Force pilot aged 34, had joined Turkish Airlines in 1995 and had accumulated 6,309 flight hours in total. First Officer Ismail Uluslu, aged 33, had joined Turkish Airlines in 1998 and had since clocked 2,052 flight hours in total. The flight was carrying 75 passengers. Of the 80 people on board, initially six passengers survived but one passenger later succumbed to his injuries. Accident Flight 634 departed Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport at 18:43 EET (16:43 UTC) for the nearly two-hour flight to Diyarbakƒ±r in southeastern Turkey. Approximately one hour into the flight and off the destination airport, the crew contacted Diyarbakir Airport's approach control, which cleared the flight to approach the airport from the south for runway 34 using VHF omnidirectional range ‚Äì a type of short-range radio navigation system which enables aircraft with a receiving unit to determine their position and stay on course ‚Äì and instructed the crew to descend to . The weather report relayed to crew by the controller stated no winds and visibility of . When the flight was from runway 34 and at an altitude of , air traffic control instructed the crew to continue the approach and report as soon as they had established visual contact with the runway. The crew acknowledged the call and prepared the aircraft for landing, deploying the landing gear and extending the flaps. Continuing to descend, the aircraft reached its minimum descent altitude (MDA) of ‚Äì the lowest altitude to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided (the airport was not equipped with an instrument landing system) ‚Äì but both pilots said that they still had no visual reference to the runway or its approach lighting system because of the thick fog. One pilot discerned some lights in the distance but was not sure what exactly they belonged to. Nonetheless, violating standard procedures, the captain decided to continue the approach to as close as to the runway and descended further to and beyond, well below the MDA. At off the threshold of the runway and at an altitude of (which in this case constituted the decision height), the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) started to trigger aural alarms. Eight seconds later, the crew decided to abort the landing and initiated a go-around, but before being able to execute the command struck the ground with the undersurface of the fuselage and the landing gear at 20:19 EET (18:19 UTC), off the threshold of runway 34 and off the approach lights at a speed of around . The aircraft slid on the ground for about while starting to disintegrate. Eventually, it hit a slope, broke up into three major pieces, exploded and caught fire; most of the bodies and parts of the wreckage were burnt. The debris was spread out in an area of about . The impact instantly killed both pilots, the three flight attendants and 69 of the 75 passengers. Six passengers survived, one of whom however later succumbed to his injuries in hospital. =Immediate response= Since the crash site was within the boundaries of the airport, search and rescue teams of the 2nd Tactical Air Force Command stationed at Diyarbakƒ±r Air Base, which included two helicopters, were quickly deployed. However, neither helicopter was able to participate in the rescue efforts because of the dense fog, which, according to eyewitness accounts, was below one metre at times. Numerous firetrucks and ambulances were deployed to extinguish the post-crash fire and rescue the victims. Investigation The investigation into the accident was carried out by Turkey's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Both flight recorders ‚Äì the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and the flight data recorder (FDR) ‚Äì were found intact and were sent to Turkish Airlines' laboratories for analysis. According to records, Captain Yunuk and First Officer Uluslu were found to have been properly trained, qualified and experienced. They had sufficient rest before reporting for duty on the day of the accident. Drug and alcohol tests returned negative results. Investigators also turned their attention to the aircraft, but were not able to detect any abnormalities. All maintenance checks were completed properly. Close examination of the engines revealed that they were operating normally at the time of the accident. The aircraft was properly configured for landing ‚Äì the flaps and the landing gear were extended properly and the altimeter was set correctly ‚Äì and the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) also produced alarms which could be easily heard on the CVR recordings. Search and rescue teams who immediately rushed to the site to respond to the crash reported thick fog at the crash site and complained about the lack of visibility which according to their account was as low as at times. This clearly contradicts the weather report the air traffic controller at Diyarbakƒ±r Airport had relayed to the crew minutes before the crash. According to them, the fire could not even be seen until arriving on the scene. Analysis of the FDR and the CVR revealed that at the moment the aircraft struck the ground it was at a heading of 339¬∞ (north- northwest, in line with the runway centerline) and short of the threshold of runway 34 at a positive pitch angle of five degrees (which corresponds to a slight nose-up position). The autopilot was found to have been activated up until a short time before the accident. =Final report= The investigation was completed around two years later in April 2005 and concluded that: The Turkish Airline Pilots Association stated that an instrument landing system might have prevented the accident.

During the Shunzhi Era, Pan lived in Shanying (Traditional/Simplified Chinese: Â±±Èô∞/Â±±Èò¥; current Shaoxing), Zhejiang Province for ten years. Later Pan became a lecturer in Kunshan (ÊòÜÂ±±; current Suzhou), Jiangsu Province. Philosophy Pan chronologically studied and inspected the philosophies of Cheng-Zhu, Lu-Wang, and Buddhist philosophy (especially the Zen buddhism). Pan discovered some subtle conflicts between these philosophical schools, and thought the Neo-confucianism developed in Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties were quite derivatives from the original thoughts or principles of Confucius and Mencius. Pan criticized that Neo-confucianism mixed too much Zen buddhism, thus called those confucian scholars the \\"Monks of the Confucian Temple\\". Pan considered that Cheng-Zhu School philosophically debated with Lu-Wang School is a kind of using Taoism to attack Buddhism (‰ª•ËÄÅÊîª‰Ωõ), and vice versa (‰ª•‰ΩõÊîªËÄÅ). Pan's philosophy was searching for the humanity (Ê±Ç‰ªÅ), and he emphasized to search truth or true knowledge from daily living and practice.

Its home stadium \\"Louis Ayer\\" has a capacity of 12 000 seats. Club colors are blue and white. The club was officially founded in 1945. However it exists informally from 1902, which makes it the oldest Bulgarian football club.  History  The original founding year of Dorostol is considered to be the year 1902. The club was originally affiliated with the Bulgarian school in Silistra, whose students founded the sports society \\"Strela\\", meaning arrow in Bulgarian. Their first kit was black, which was also the color of the uniforms of the students from the school. From 1903 to 1909, the gymnastics teacher at the school was Louis Eyer, a Swiss gymnasist. In 1920, a Romanian team was founded in the area, called Dristor, later renamed Venus. This was, because at the time, Dobruja was part of Romania. After 1941, when Dobruja was given back to Bulgaria, the team is renamed to \\"Dorostol\\". In 1949, there is a major reorganization of sports activities and clubs in the country. New sports societies emerge in the city of Silistra, such as \\"Cherveno Zname\\", \\"Torpedo\\" and \\"Stroitel\\". There is a tournament held between the teams to be decided which one will play professional football. \\"Cherveno Zname\\" wins the tournament, and is promoted to the B PFG, the second tier of Bulgarian football. In 1958, there is another major reorganization of sports activities in the country, which unites all the teams from Silistra into one - \\"Dorostol\\". Club colors were decided to be blue and white. In 1984, Dorostol managed to achieve something very unexpected, by reaching the final of the Cup of the Soviet Army. The club was reformed in 2014, starting from V AFG, because of financial problems.

Pierson Jr., 97, Art Historian, Dies The New York Times Born in Bloomfield, New Jersey, Pierson trained as a high-school student with landscape painter Charles Warren Eaton. After earning bachelor‚Äôs degree in fine arts at Yale in 1934, he became the first person whom the school awarded a master's degree in fine arts. In 1941 he received a second master's, this time in art history from New York University. Pierson joined the United States Navy the day after Pearl Harbor, working for the secret radio program. When the war finished, Pierson decided to return to Yale to undertake a Ph.D. in art history. His dissertation studied the industrial architecture of New England, and his passion for this subject remained with him for the rest of his career. In the 1970s, he campaigned to save a former mill in Harrisville, New Hampshire. Due to his efforts, Harrisville is the only 19th-century mill town that has survived intact into the 21st century. Having caught the eye of S. Lane Faison, legendary head of the art history department at Williams College, Pierson moved to Williamstown to teach studio art and American architecture in 1946. With Faison and their colleague Whitney Stoddard, Pierson worked continuously to turn Williams students towards careers in art history rather than law and finance. Their efforts resulted in a generation of Williams-educated curators who went on to lead some of the most distinguished museums and art collections in the United States. This group, whom the New York Times has termed the \\"Williams Art Mafia,\\" include among its ranks Earl A. Powell III of the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, Glenn D. Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, James N. Wood of the Art Institute of Chicago and the J. Paul Getty Trust and Thomas Krens of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Pierson, who was famous for tearing up his notes at the end of each of his lectures, emphasized the importance of maintaining the vitality and variety of his teaching throughout his thirty-year career. Pierson retired in 1973. Although teaching undergraduates was Pierson's foremost passion, he also authored a four-volume scholarly series entitled American Buildings and Their Architects along with William Jordy. In conjunction with the Society of Architectural Historians, he was also working on the sixty-volume Buildings of the United States Series, which catalogs the architectural history of each of the fifty states in addition to several major cities. Pierson died on December 3, 2008, in Williamstown, Massachusetts.William Pierson; art professor influenced generations of curators dies The Boston Globe He is survived by two daughters and two granddaughters.

Direct2D takes advantage of hardware acceleration via the graphics processing unit (GPU) found in compatible graphics cards within personal computer, tablet, smartphone and modern graphical device. It offers high visual quality and fast rendering performance while maintaining full interoperability with classic Win32 graphics APIs such as GDI/GDI+ and modern graphics APIs such as Direct3D. Overview Direct2D is a native code API based on C++ that can be called by managed code and uses a \\"lightweight COM\\" approachhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/38174095/what-exactly-is- lightweight-com just like Direct3D, with minimal amount of abstraction. However, unlike WPF and similarly to GDI/GDI+, Direct2D is an \\"immediate mode\\" rendering API with simple BeginDraw/Draw/EndDraw calls; Direct2D has no concept of a \\"scene\\" and does not use retained tree structures, and the rendering state is preserved between drawing calls. Direct2D can minimize CPU usage and utilize hardware rendering on a graphics card with minimum support of Direct3D Feature Level 9 with WDDM 1.1 drivers. Applications can choose to use it exclusively with CPU, the so-called software rendering by using it in conjunction with WARP10 in situations when hardware capability is not available, such as when running within a device with minimal GPU support, under terminal service, Windows session 0, or when graphics rendering is performed in a remote server with the graphical result sent back to the client device. Direct2D performance and memory usage scale linearly with primitive counts in both software and hardware. Direct2Dhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/ff729481(v=vs.85).aspxhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/dd756766(v=vs.85).aspx supports high-quality rendering with the following key features: * High-quality subpixel text rendering via DirectWrite for both grayscale and ClearType technique * Per- primitive antialiasing * B√©zier geometry draw and fill * Rich geometry operations (e.g. Boolean operations, path widening, outlining, etc.) * Composite layers * Primitive blend modes (e.g. source-over, source-copy, min blends, etc.) * Image built-in and custom effects for photo adjustment, graphical and color transform * Gradient brush and mesh * Command list for command buffering and printing * Scalable ink stroke * Sprite batch for game development Direct2D allows full interoperability with GDI, GDI+, and permits rendering to and from a Direct3D surface, as well as to and from a GDI/GDI+ device context (HDC). It can be used effectively together with Windows Imaging Component (WIC) for image encoding/decoding, and with DirectWrite for text formatting and font processing. Such interoperability allows developers to gradually replace critical code paths with Direct2D code without the need to overhaul their entire source code. In Windows 10 timeframe, an Open Source project called Win2D was developed by Microsoft to further simplify the usage of Direct2D and DirectWrite in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application. Win2D is a highly-efficient WinRT wrapper of Direct2D and DirectWrite designed from the ground up to integrate seamlessly with XAML Canvas control while preserving the power of the underlying graphics subsystem.  Subsequent versions  Direct2D 1.1 = An updated version of Direct2D was launched with Windows 8 in October 2012.https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/hardware/dn653328(v=vs.85).aspx#tir It was also backported to Windows 7 SP1 (but not to Windows Vista) via the Windows 7 platform update. The original version of Direct2D was tied to DirectX 11 (in hardware, up to Direct3D 10.1 is used), whereas this version of Direct2D integrates with DirectX 11.1. Windows 8 also added interoperability between XAML and Direct2D along with Direct3D components, which can be all mixed in an application.http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsappdev/archive/2012/03/15/combining- xaml-and-directx.aspx = Direct2D 1.2 = New features were added to Direct2D with Windows 8.1 in October 2013:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/hh802478(v=vs.85).aspx Geometry realizations,https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/dn363632(v=vs.85).aspx Direct2D effects API,https://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/hh973240(v=vs.85).aspxhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/hh706316(v=vs.85).aspxhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en- us/library/windows/desktop/hh973241(v=vs.85).aspx command list API, multithreading APIs, per-device rendering priority, support for JPEG YCbCr images for smaller memory footprint, and support for block compressed formats (DDS files). = Direct2D 1.3 = The release of Windows 10 in July 2015 brought important updates and new features to Direct2D such as the performance improvement of rendering scalable text without font rasterization, the ability to download the needed font from the cloud on demand without requiring the font installation step, an optimization for faster image loading and image effect rendering, and a more sophisticated way to apply gradient brush through the use of 2D mesh made of gradient patches. This release also introduced a brand-new API extension to support digital ink, which is highly leveraged by the brand-new Microsoft Edge browser as well as the new ink canvas XAML control.  Implementation  In their 2012 paper on the competing NV path rendering OpenGL extension, Mark Kilgard and Jeff Bolz explain (and criticize) the internals of Direct2D as follows: \\"Direct2D operates by transforming paths on the CPU and then performing a constrained trapezoidal tessellation of each path. The result is a set of pixel-space trapezoids and additional shaded geometry to compute fractional coverage for the left and right edges of the trapezoids. These trapezoids and shaded geometry are then rasterized by the GPU. The resulting performance is generally better than entirely CPU-based approaches and requires no ancillary storage for multisample or stencil state; Direct2D renders directly into an aliased framebuffer with properly antialiased results. Direct2D‚Äôs primary disadvantage is [that] the ultimate performance is determined not by the GPU (doing fairly trivial rasterization) but rather by the CPU performing the transformation and trapezoidal tessellation of each path and Direct3D validation work.\\" In July 2012, the Windows 8 team posted the following on the blog of Steven Sinofsky: \\"To improve geometry rendering performance in Windows 8, we focused on reducing the CPU cost associated with tessellation in two ways. First, we optimized our implementation of tessellation when rendering simple geometries like rectangles, lines, rounded rectangles, and ellipses.\\" These common-case optimizations claimed to improve performance in the range of 184% to 438%, depending on the primitive. The post continued: \\"Second, to improve performance when rendering irregular geometry (e.g. geographical borders on a map), we use a new graphics hardware feature called Target Independent Rasterization, or TIR. TIR enables Direct2D to spend fewer CPU cycles on tessellation, so it can give drawing instructions to the GPU more quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing visual quality. TIR is available in new GPU hardware designed for Windows 8 that supports DirectX 11.1.\\"Rob Copeland, with contributions from Sriram Subramanian, Dan McLachlan, Kam VedBrat, Steve Lim, and Jianye Lu, and introduction by Steven Sinofsky Hardware accelerating everything: Windows 8 graphics This was followed by a benchmark using some 15 SVGs, claiming performance improvements in the range of 151% to 523%. The section concluded: \\"We worked closely with our graphics hardware partners to design TIR. Dramatic improvements were made possible because of that partnership. DirectX 11.1 hardware is already on the market today and we‚Äôre working with our partners to make sure more TIR-capable products will be broadly available.\\" The TIR feature was among those that caused a \\"war of words\\" between Nvidia and AMD around December 2012, because Nvidia's Kepler GPU family does not support it, whereas AMD's GCN does. In response to customer demands, an Nvidia support staffer posted that TIR cannot be simply implemented at the driver level, but requires new hardware;https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/511499/geforce-drivers/give- us-dx11-1-driver-support-on-dx11-cards-no-new-hardware-is-required-for- dx11-1/post/3642626/#3642626http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3196/~/fermi- and-kepler-directx-api-support the Maxwell 2 architecture, introduced in September 2014, is such hardware.http://www.anandtech.com/show/8526/nvidia- geforce-gtx-980-review/4 In Windows 8.1, Direct2D can use the Direct3D11 hardware tesselators, but only in conjunction with \`D2D1_FILL_MODE_ALTERNATE\`. If another fill mode is used (e.g. \`D2D1_FILL_MODE_WINDING\`) then Direct2D falls back to tessellation on the CPU, but still uses TIR for anti-aliasing (if TIR is available). Since hardware tessellation is available in base Direct3D11 (not necessarily 11.1), Microsoft claimed significant performance improvements with Direct2D in Windows 8.1 (vs. Windows 8) on non-TIR hardware.http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-191 19:00 to 20:00 and 55:00 to 56:30  Uses and performance  Internet Explorer 9 and later versions use Direct2D and DirectWrite for improved performance and visual quality.Mozilla chucks Roc at Microsoft's new hardness ‚Ä¢ The Register Direct2D support was added in the alpha version of Firefox 3.7, roughly doubling its rendering speed. (Firefox 4 also added DirectWrite support, but this was made non-default for some fonts in Firefox 7 due to user complaints about the rendering quality. Google Chrome uses its own 2D library called Skia, which in turn renders through ANGLE on Windows.) In Firefox 70.0, on old hardware, Direct2D is disabled on blacklisted old graphics drivers if they lack features and area is blacked out e.g. in Google Maps. Ars Technica's Peter Bright noted in the summer of 2012 that \\"most desktop applications don't use Direct2D.\\" Microsoft Office 2013 supports either Direct2D+DirectWrite or GDI+Uniscribe for display rendering and typography.

Early life According to P. David Searles' book, A College for Appalachia, Buchanan was born in upstate New York in 1886 and grew up in Moravia. The obituary published by the Associated Press in June 1988, however, stated that she died at the age of 100, and the Social Security Death Index records her date of birth as June 21, 1887. This birthdate is confirmed by her greatniece, Eleanor Gibney of St. John, Virgin Islands. June Buchanan's parents, Frank Buchanan and Julia McCormick Buchanan, hailed from small towns near Syracuse. Education Buchanan graduated from Syracuse University in 1913 with a degree in science. After teaching in Groton, New York, she pursued graduate studies at Wellesley College, with a focus on liberal arts. While at Wellesley, she encountered fellow students who heard of Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd's efforts to educate children in the Appalachian Mountains of Knott County, Kentucky. Career In January 1919, she arrived in Pippa Passes to assist Lloyd's efforts at the Caney Creek Community Center. In 1923, she and Lloyd chartered Caney Junior College, which would be renamed Alice Lloyd College upon Lloyd's death in 1962. In 1976, a campus building, the June Buchanan Alumni Center, was named in her honor. Buchanan later became mayor of Pippa Passes. The college's K-12 prep school, the June Buchanan School, was named in her honor in 1984. Death and legacy Buchanan continued to serve the college until her death in May 1988. She died at a hospital in the city of Martin in neighboring Floyd County. In addition to the June Buchanan School and the June Buchanan Alumni Center named in her honor, the June Buchanan Medical Clinic, a community health clinic owned and operated by the University of Kentucky's Centers for Excellence in Rural Health, is located in Hindman, the county seat of Knott County.

Geographical location The geographical area called the Neue Welt (new world) evolved as the industry started establishing itself around the upper end of the \\"St. Alban-Teich\\". This is a canal, artificially constructed by the Basler Kloster St. Alban during the 12th century, so as to bring water and water power to the industry in Basel. Later, during the years 1624‚Äì25, the canal was prolonged through Br√ºglingen towards the Birs waterfall in M√ºnchenstein and from here the water is diverged. History Hammerschmiede, Neue Welt, M√ºnchenstein, refurbished in 1970 The Villa Ehinger is situated in the middle of a Park, above the industry. The neo-classical summer residence became renowned under the name of the ultimate owners. The Villa was originally built in association with the previous hammer mill (Hammerschmiede). Villa Ehinger, refurbished in 1973 The hammer mill from 1660 is the oldest building situated on the banks of the canal. It was built by Ludwig Krug. In 1822 the hammer mill was refurbished as a cotton-spinning mill by Felix Sarasin (1771‚Äì1839). The technical administration was taken on by his son Ludwig August Sarasin (1804‚Äì31), who sought for his new residence to be built nearby. Sarasin's acquaintance with the young architect Melchior Berri led him to commission Berri with the planning and construction of this country house in 1829. Up until then Berri's work had been confined by the existing frontages of the town streets (Basel Casino and other buildings within the town). Here, however, he was free to build a house that was unconfined by other buildings or existing boundaries, a building that should have an English garden surrounding it. Unfortunately Ludwig August Sarasin died in 1831, before the conclusion of the building, in 1932. One of the Sarasin daughters married into the Ehinger Family and that is how the villa came to its name. Modern History Villa Ehinger Villa Ehinger The family Ehinger sold the entire estate including the villa and its grounds to the municipality (Gemeinde) M√ºnchenstein in 1959. The municipality then passed the estate onto the canton Baselland in 1962. The canton built a grammar (secondary) school on the estate grounds in 1972. In 1973 the villa was completely restored and refurbished as a music school. During the refurbishment, significant cultural consideration were paid to the initial Architecture. Special attention was given to ensure that each separate room was given a new function, without changing its individuality within the historical building. Architecture Villa Ehinger. The Portico with Balcony und the Main Entrance Villa Ehinger, Main Entrance The villa has a virtually quadratic ground plan. It is a two-storey building. On the western side of the house there is a Portico as entrance. Two Doric columns carry an entablature and the balcony. Built onto the eastern side of the villa (facing towards the park) there is also a two-storey Loggia, but this is somewhat narrower. The semicircular arched foyer is one of the most significant features of this villa. This foyer/vestibule can be assigned to the themes of Sebastiano Serlio (1475‚Äì1554) and Andrea Palladio (1508‚Äì1580). In the middle of the pyramidal broach roof is the Palmette (also called anthemion) window storey. The crown is concluded with a roof pinnacle, a rod of Asclepius, to emphasize the apex of the gable. There is a fountain on the southern side of the house that is typical for the epoch. In the interior, the sections are aligned to the east- west axis. The rooms are grouped around the central Foyer. Not only Berri's stucco ceilings, but also the neo-classical white stove on the first floor and the original drawings of the Portico remain conserved.

Biography  Her father was Andr√© Terrasse (1890-1951), an economic journalist and secretary to the Alliance d√©mocratique, and her mother was Marthe Brossette, daughter of Fran√ßois Brossette, mayor of Givors. The family lived in Paris from 1933. On 28 January 1938, at the age of fourteen, when Marie-Louise was at a school dance, she was introduced by her brother to the politician and future president of the French Republic Fran√ßois Mitterrand. In March 1940, in spite of her youth, they became engaged, but they separated on 15 January 1942, when the Germans occupied France. During that time he sent her more than 300 letters and poems.*Jean-Marc Terrasse, Catherine Langeais, la Fianc√©e des Fran√ßais Then in 1944 Mitterrand married Danielle Gouze whom he met in a resistance network, and Marie-Louise married a Polish count Antoine Gordowski, with whom they had two children, Jean-Michel and √âlisabeth. They separated in 1949 and divorced in 1954.  Television  Initially recruited to present the programmes of the new national television network RTF in 1949, Catherine Langeais was probably the most popular lady presenter (speakerine) of French television, from the end of the 1950s through the 1970s. It was she who welcomed BBC viewers in the first international on-line television broadcast, the Franco-British week of July 1952, thanks to the new conversion standard which was to allow, a year later, the international broadcast of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and later the inauguration of the Eurovision song contest. In parallel with introducing programmes, Catherine Langeais took part in diverse light entertainment programmes in the years 1950-1960, such as \\"C'est arriv√© √† 36 chandelles\\" and \\"La s√©quence du spectateur\\" (later renamed \\"La s√©quence du t√©l√©spectateur\\"), as well as the cookery programme \\"Art et magie de la cuisine\\" with the chef Raymond Oliver. A chronic illness, which she concealed for a long time, made the job difficult but did not prevent her from working until 1955. Patiently, although ill, she continued with her programmes (\\"A vous de juger\\", \\"La s√©quence du t√©l√©spectateur\\", and some children's programmes). On Sunday 5 January 1975, she emotionally closed the broadcasts of the first channel (ORTF), which was replaced the next day with the new public company T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise 1 (TF1) in which she did no more than the voice-overs of the \\"La s√©quence du t√©l√©spectateur\\", while her husband Pierre Sabbagh was director of programmes for the second channel. In 1987, Fran√ßois Mitterrand presented her with the L√©gion d'honneur award for her undeniable imprint on the history of French television.  Personal life  She married television producer and director Pierre Sabbagh, creator in 1949 of the first daily television news channel in the world. They had no children. Behind the official image she presented as \\"la fianc√©e des fran√ßais\\", obsessed with appearance, she was a complex, courageous woman who throughout her life secretly fought illness. She died from multiple sclerosis in 1998 and was buried in Valmondois cemetery near Paris.

Since 1915 a new channel for the river separated it from Chesterfield County and the former channel no longer separates it from the city. Once a warehouse and wharf-filled urban landscape initially platted in 1749, the island was devastated by a 1993 tornado before citizen involvement caused creation of the Pocahontas Island Historic District, which in 2006 achieved listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a historic district because of its significance in African- American history and for its prehistoric indigenous archeological assets. Archeologists found evidence of prehistoric Native American settlement dating from 6500 B.C. \\"Pocahontas Research Project\\" , Petersburg, VA Official Website, 2006, accessed 29 Dec 2008 The Appomattoc tribe occupied this area and encountered English colonists and other European settlers by the early 18th century, when the first enslaved Africans were brought to work here. In the 19th century, Pocohontas Island became a notable freedom colony. the first predominately free black settlement in the state and, by mid-19th century, one of the largest in the nation (although enslaved people also lived on the island, and some free blacks owned slaves).Janice H. Cosel and Laura Jo Leffel, \\"A Case Study of Pocahontas Island: Resistance to Post-Impact Evacuation in a Historic Black Community Virginia\\", Electronic Journal of Emergency Management, Number 1, 1999, accessed 27 Dec 2008 In 1860 slightly more than half of Petersburg's population was black, and 3,224 or one-third of those people were free; they constituted the largest free black population of the time. During the 20th century, the island's population declined as people moved north in the Great Migration. In 1975 residents secured renewed residential zoning to protect their neighborhoods from industrial development proposed by the city. History Archaeological evidence of a prehistoric Native American community dated to 6500 BC has been found on the island. This is at the beginning of the Middle Archaic Period (6500 BC to 3000 BC) or end of Early Archaic Period (8000 BC to 6500 BC)\\"Prehistoric Time Chart\\", Rock Creek Park, National Park Service, accessed 30 Dec 2008 When English colonists first arrived in Virginia in 1607, the Appomattoc tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy had this area within their territory. English colonial settlement on the peninsula started in the 18th century. Some of the first enslaved Africans were brought here in 1732 to work in John Bolling's tobacco warehouses. Surveyors platted the land in 1749, and settlers named the village \\"Wittontown.\\" When formally organized as a town in 1752, it was renamed Pocahontas after the Native American daughter of Powhatan, who was important to colonial history and, together with her English husband, became an ancestor of numerous First Families of Virginia. In 1757 Petersburg built a bridge to link the peninsula to the city, and for some early years, a board of trustees managed the \\"island\\" and its development. Incorporated within the city limits in 1784 after the American Revolutionary War, the Pocahontas Island neighborhood became a center of a free black population. Pocahontas Island's large free black residential community is the oldest in the nation and its commercial center developed into a destination for the state's free blacks. By 1797 free blacks established the Sandy River Baptist Church, and some members in 1818 moved across the then-river channel into the city's center and built the Gillfield Baptist Church. The growth of industrial jobs attracted free blacks to Petersburg. Artisans and craftsmen could make a living, while others worked as boatmen and fishermen on the river. By 1860, Petersburg's population was half black - of those, one-third were free. It was the largest free black population in the nation.Henry Chase, \\"Proud, free and black: Petersburg - visiting the Virginia location of the largest number of 19th century free slaves\\", American Visions, Jun-Jul 1994, accessed 27 Dec 2008 From 1830 until 1860, Pocahontas island's (recently excavated 30x300 foot) railroad depot was the terminus of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad. It was Petersburg's main freight and passenger station until the American Civil War, when it also transported many Confederate troops and supplies. The island was filled with many wharves and warehouses, in addition to residential streets.Pocahontas Island NRIS 2006 section 7 No sign of the Confederate fortifications on the island remains, and the short railroad line built in 1863 to simplify transshipment of goods from Norfolk and Danville railroad lines to Richmond via Petersburg was removed immediately after the war; the Union Signal Corps filed many reports of railroad activity on Pocahontas during the war.NRIS Section 8 pp. 29-31 However, Petersburg City's government, despite building another bridge in 1851, often neglected the neighborhood, usually more concerned with development in white areas. Numerous antebellum houses survive, especially on the island's east end, and archeologists have also unearthed the foundations of the railroad depot and the Petersburg Distilling Company, Inc. (1911-1916).NRIS Section 7 Two surviving houses were linked to the Underground Railroad before the American Civil War: the Jarratt House (808-810 Logan Street, predates 1820 on tax records and is the island's sole surviving brick building), and the double house at 215 Witten Street is informally called the \\"Underground Railroad House\\" (predating 1838, it once had a pseudo-brick facade). The island's remaining 19th century houses were build in the \\"shotgun style\\" usually associated with larger southern cities such as New Orleans, Houston, Atlanta and Louisville to make maximum use of narrow urban lots as well as local ventilation patterns. It took decades for Petersburg to rebuild after the American Civil War, although one railroad line was rebuilt sufficiently by November 1867 for General Robert E. Lee to stop at the city en route to his son's wedding. Pocahontas had mixed industrial, commercial and residential use, including a sawmill by 1877 and a powder magazine on land now occupied by a waste treatment plant.NRIS pp. 31-32 Postwar employment cycles continued to affect less educated blacks severely, especially the Panic of 1893. The original Pocahontas Chapel was built at the war's end by the New York Freedman's Relief Society,NRIS Section 8 p. 31 and also served as a school for freedmen. Destroyed by the 1993 windstorm, it was rebuilt and remains a community center.http://www.aahistoricsitesva.org/items/show/344?tour=14&index;=21 Although the original building was locally rumored to have once served as a headquarters for General Grant at nearby City Point (Hopewell, Virginia) and transported to Pocahontas, that building was actually dismantled and taken to Philadelphia for an exhibition, and most of the City Point structures were tents.NRIS After the war, Pocahontas-born free black William N. Stevens became a lawyer and the first African American to serve in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, although his legislative district centered on nearby Sussex County. Stevens maintained a house on the island (which still survives), though he died relatively young of throat cancer in 1889. Increasing industrialization in Petersburg and nearby Hopewell provided continued opportunities for blacks, even though the white-dominated Virginia legislature imposed racial segregation and disfranchisement in the late 19th century. Ice, coal, oil and lumber companies operated on Pocahontas by the early 20th century, although the island suffered devastating floods in 1910 and 1920, and the river rechannelled midway between. Furthermore, the DuPont company established a munitions factory in nearby Hopewell by 1914, and although that city burned the following year, it then prospered, and many blacks chose to live on Pocahontas. Largely excluded from the political system, blacks created their own opportunities. As the 20th century progressed, the more ambitious and younger people tended to leave the island (and many southern states) for other opportunities. The Great Migration to northern industrial cities, starting about World War I, is the time Islanders refer to as \\"when they lost the 'cream of the crop', and the majority of the remaining population being elderly retirees who sustain themselves on small fixed incomes.\\" The neighborhood shared economic troubles with Petersbburg, which lost jobs to other areas and increasingly to Richmond, long the state capital and which became the region's and state's financial center. In 1971 the Petersburg city government rezoned some of the island for light industrial use. This caused the homes of 250 residents to be threatened with condemnation, making it impossible for owners to get financing for renovations. In 1975 residents won a battle to restore residential zoning. Allied groups began to survey and document the many historic properties. The Pocahontas Island Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 because of its abundance of archaeological sites from prehistory through historic times, and of numerous antebellum buildings marking its history as a free black community.\\"Pocahontas Island Historic District\\", National Register Nominations, Heritage Matters, Jan-Feb 2008, accessed 30 Dec 2008 A 1993 tornado severely damaged some houses and the chapel, and in 2015 the neighborhood was still listed among the state's most endangered historic sites. By the late 20th century, the population had declined to fewer than 100 on the island from a high of 1700 earlier.Richard Holtzclaw, \\"History from a different angle\\", Daily Press, 17 Jan 2007, accessed 29 Dec 2008 Recognition Because of its significant resources, ranging from prehistoric to historic, the Pocahontas Island Historic District is listed on both the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

His other municipal offices included President of Christ's Hospital and Comptroller-General of Hospitals 1594‚Äì1602. Martin was Warden of the Royal Mint by 1572, and was responsible for overseeing the workings of the mint and the quality of the coinage. John Stow's Survey of London records Martin's charges against John Lonyson or Lonison, Master of the Mint, in the 1570s, a matter that was finally weighed by a commission of Privy Council members including Nicholas Bacon, the Lord Keeper, William Cecil, Lord Burghley, the Lord Treasurer, and others,Martin 1892, p. 24 which recommended that Martin himself succeeded Lonyson as Master of the Mint in 1582, serving in that capacity until his death in 1617.Challis 1992, p. 259 He provided silver plate for the use of Mary, Queen of Scots, including a silver gilt bowl and cover in 1585, decorated with an engraved pattern of fish.Arthur Collins, Jewels and Plate of Queen Elizabeth (London, 1955), p. 582.

Later life Martin had remained both Warden and Master of the Mint for almost two decades, but following charges in 1597 that he was profiteering by delaying repayments he sold his office of Warden to Sir Thomas Knyvet. The two soon fell out, with Knyvet accusing Martin of owing the crown substantial funds and Martin insisting he was owed. Martin was briefly imprisoned for debt, which led to his removal from his Aldermanry on 31 August 1602 on account of his \\"unfitting demeanour and carriage\\".

Structure While the New terminal building, capable of handling 300 passengers at peak hours, featured six check-in counters, VIP Lounges, Departure and Arrival Lounges, Transit Suites & Snooze Cabins, Visitors Waiting Area and Cafeteria, the airside saw drastic improvements too. The sole runway was extended from 1375 metres to 2300 metres. Runway width was also increased by 15 metres to 45 metres, making it capable of handling larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. A new night landing system and airfield lighting system was installed along with modern Navigational aids. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation awarded Provisional Aerodrome Licence to Nanded Airport in Public use Category on 5 April 2010 and Permanent Licence on 1 October 2010. Passenger traffic at Nanded airport in FY 2011 Q2 increased to almost 5,700 per month from 3,000 in the previous quarter.

Atlas D was first used as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to deliver a nuclear weapon payload on a suborbital trajectory. It was later developed as a launch vehicle to carry a payload to low Earth orbit on its own, and later to geosynchronous orbit, to the Moon, Venus, or Mars with the Agena or Centaur upper stage. Atlas D was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11, 12, 13 and 14, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at Launch Complex 576. The fully operational D-series Atlas was similar to the R&D; model Atlas B and C, but incorporated a number of design changes implemented as a result of lessons learned during test flights. In addition, the D-series had the full-up Rocketdyne MA-2 propulsion system with 360,000 pounds of thrust versus the 250,000 pounds of thrust in the Atlas B/C's engines. Operational Atlas D missiles retained radio ground guidance aside from a few R&D; launches which tested the inertial guidance system designed for the Atlas E/F, and the Atlas D would be the basis for most space launcher variants of Atlas. History1959= The Atlas D testing program began with the launch of Missile 3D from LC-13 on April 14, 1959. Engine startup proceeded normally, but it quickly became apparent that the LOX fill/drain valve had not closed properly. LOX spilled around the base of the thrust section, followed by leakage from the RP-1 fill/drain valve. The propellants then mixed and exploded on the launch stand. Because of the open LOX fill/drain valve, the Atlas's propellant system suffered a loss of fuel flow and pressure that caused the B-2 engine to operate at only 65% thrust. Due to the imbalanced thrust, the Atlas lifted at a slanted angle, which also prevented one of the launcher hold-down arms from retracting properly. Subsequent film review showed that no apparent damage to the missile resulted from either the launcher release or the propellant explosion. The flight control system managed to retain missile stability until T+26 seconds when unstable B-2 combustion from the loss of LOX resulted in an explosion that caused the booster section to rip away from the missile. The Atlas sank backwards through its own trail of fire until the Range Safety destruct command was issued at T+36 seconds. The sustainer and verniers continued operating until missile destruction. All other missile systems had functioned well during the brief flight and the LOX fill/drain valve malfunction was attributed to a breakdown of the butterfly actuator shaft, possibly during the Pre-Flight Readiness Firing a few weeks earlier, so Atlas vehicles starting with Missile 26D would use an actuator made of steel rather than aluminum. The leakage from the fuel fill/drain valve was traced to an improper procedure during the prelaunch countdown and was not connected to the LOX fill/drain valve problem. LC-13 sustained some damage due to the anomalous liftoff of Atlas 3D, this was quickly repaired and preparations began for the launch of Missile 5D.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 3D.\\" Convair, 29 April 1959 On May 18, Atlas 7D was prepared for a night launch of an RVX-2 reentry vehicle from LC-14, the second attempt to fly one after the launch of a C-series Atlas had miscarried two months earlier. The test was conducted with the Mercury astronauts in attendance in order to showcase the vehicle that would take them into orbit, but 64 seconds of flight ended in another explosion, prompting Gus Grissom to remark \\"Are we really going to get on top of one of those things?\\". This failure was traced to improper separation of the right launcher hold-down pin, which damaged the B-2 nacelle structure and caused helium pressurization gas to escape during ascent. At 62 seconds into the launch, the pressure in the LOX tank exceeded the pressure in the RP-1 tank, which reversed the intermediate bulkhead. Two seconds later, the missile exploded. Film review confirmed that the hold-down pin on the right launcher arm failed to retract at liftoff and was jerked from the missile. The resultant force caused a four-inch gap in the B-2 nacelle structure which also damaged low-pressure helium lines. The hold-down pin had not retracted due to a sheared retaining bolt in the bell crank pulley system in the right launcher arm. Once again, all other systems in the Atlas functioned well and there were no problems not directly attributable to the launcher malfunction. The flight of 7D resulted in improved maintenance procedures for the launcher equipment at CCAS and use of higher heat steel in the bell crank retaining bolts.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 7D.\\" Convair, 3 June 1959 Atlas 5D lifted from LC-13 on June 6. The flight went perfectly until booster separation, at which point a fuel leak started. Tank pressure decreased until the intermediate bulkhead reversed at T+157 seconds and the missile exploded. This incident was similar in nature to an Atlas C failure earlier in the year and it resulted in a major investigation and redesign effort. The failure point was either the fuel staging disconnect valve or associated plumbing, and modifications were made to the disconnect valve, plumbing, booster separation system, jettison tracks, and even the launcher mechanism, all of which were possible causes of the malfunction. On July 29, Missile 11D was launched with a series of modifications designed to correct problems on previous Atlas launches. The flight was mostly successful and booster section separation was performed successfully on a D-series Atlas for the first time, but some difficulties with the hydraulic system occurred due to low engine compartment temperatures caused by a probable LOX leak. Missile 14D launched from LC-13 on August 11, at which point the Air Force somewhat reluctantly declared the Atlas to be operational as a missile system. On September 9, Missile 12D launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, marking the first Atlas flight from the West Coast. Eight more D-series ICBM tests were conducted in 1959, as well as two space launches using Atlas D vehicles. Although assorted minor failures and hardware bugs affected these flights, the overall success rate was a major improvement over the first half of the year. Missile 26D on October 29 lost a vernier engine at booster jettison, the resultant loss of roll control causing it to impact only 600 miles downrange instead of the planned 1100. This was the only flight during this stretch where the primary goals of the mission were not accomplished. Because of growing confidence in the Atlas, it was decided to abandon PFRF (Pre-Flight Readiness Firing) tests except for the first handful of Atlas E flights as well as space launches. The final test of 1959, Missile 40D on December 19, utilized a \\"dry\\" start method (engine igniter activated before propellant injection). This experiment worked without any apparent problems. The first four Atlas flights of 1960, three CCAS and one VAFB launch, were also successful. =1960= On March 5, 1960, Missile 19D was undergoing a propellant loading exercise at 576-A2 at VAFB when a fuel leak started a fire on the pad that led to the explosion of the missile. The launch facility was written off due to the damage and not used again for almost 5 years. On March 8, 1960, Missile 44D launched from LC-11 on the first test of the AIG (All Inertial Guidance System) and experienced a 90¬∞ roll transient at liftoff. The AIG managed to correct this problem and the missile completed a successful 3000 mile lob downrange.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 44D.\\" Convair, 29 March 1960 With this string of successful Atlas tests, program officials were lulled into a sense of security that rudely ended on March 11, 1960 when Atlas 51D lifted from LC-13. The B-1 engine suffered combustion instability which caused loss of thrust within two seconds of liftoff. At T+3 seconds, the thrust section exploded, followed by structural failure of the propellant tanks, causing the Atlas to fall back onto LC-13 in an enormous fireball. The Atlas went in for a repeat performance on April 8 when Missile 48D, launched from LC-11 and intended as the first closed-loop test of the AIG (All Inertial Guidance System), experienced combustion instability again, this time in the B-2 engine. The first indication of trouble was a pressure surge in the B-2 combustion chamber, followed by unstable thrust, engine shutdown, and an explosion that started a thrust section fire. The B-1 engine then shut down, followed by the sustainer and verniers. Since the propulsion system had not attained sufficient thrust, the launcher hold-down mechanism did not release the missile, which stayed in place and burned on the pad. The thrust section fire slowed down 15 seconds after the attempted launch, then resumed around 45 seconds. At 60 seconds, the Atlas was completely destroyed when the propellant tanks exploded.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 48D.\\" Convair, 28 April 1960 Postflight analysis of the back-to-back failures found that in each case, the missile had fallen victim to rough combustion in one booster engine, which destroyed the LOX injector head (the injector damage on 51D was more extensive than 48D) and started a thrust section fire. In both missiles, the rough combustion cutoff sensor in the B-1 engine failed to operate. On 48D, the rough combustion did not occur in that engine and the lack of RCC cutoff was not a problem (B-1 thrust was terminated instead by the turbopump overspeed sensor). The B-2 RCC sensor operated correctly and terminated thrust before liftoff could be achieved. On 51D, it resulted in the B-1 continuing to operate until the missile lifted, resulting in a destructive pad fallback. The exact reason for the rough combustion was unclear, although it had occurred over a dozen times in static firing tests of the MA-2 engines. However, it was noted that the separate exhaust duct for the gas generator vent pipe had been removed from both LC-11 and LC-13 after engineers decided that it was unnecessary and impeded removal and installation of protective covers on the pipe during ground testing. It could not be determined with certainty if the lack of an exhaust duct had anything to do with the failures, and in any case, camera coverage did not offer any evidence in support of this theory. However, it was decided to put the exhaust duct back on the Atlas pads at CCAS in order to comply with the configuration of operational Atlas missile silos, and as a \\"just in case\\" measure. Adjustments to the insulation boots on both missile was also ruled out as a probable cause of the failures. Aside from re- installing the exhaust duct, camera coverage of the flame deflector pit at ignition would also be increased and greater efforts made to ensure that the booster engines were free of contaminants. Two launch facilities were now in need of repair. LC-13 was severely damaged by the fallback of 51D and would not be used again for six months, while damage to LC-11 was less extensive and repairs were completed in only two months. Attention shifted to LC-12 where Atlas 56D flew over 9000 miles with an instrumented nose cone, impacting the Indian Ocean. After the back-to-back pad explosions, it was decided to go back to using a wet start (propellants injected into the combustion chamber prior to ignition) on the Atlas rather than the failed experiment of a dry start to ensure smoother engine startup. Atlas 56D (launched on May 20) was the first East Coast launch following 48D and it incorporated the modifications to the launch facilities as well as cameras mounted on both launcher heads to look down into the nacelle sections at liftoff. This was followed by Atlas 45D, an Agena vehicle used to launch a MIDAS satellite. Missile 60D (July 2) returned to the dry start method, this time with a hold-down period to check for combustion instability rather than immediately releasing the missile upon full thrust. While no on-pad explosion resulted on this attempt, the Atlas failed to complete all of its test objectives when the vernier start tanks were inadvertently vented and refilled several times during the flight. This resulted in depletion of control helium and loss of sustainer and vernier thrust near the end of powered flight, and so the Mark III Mod 1B reentry vehicle landed some 40 miles short of its intended target point. An electrical glitch was believed to have caused the unplanned start tank venting, although the specifics of could not be determined.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 60D. Convair, 15 July 1960\\" Atlas D tests on the West Coast hit a series of snags in the following months as well. Atlas 25D had flown successfully on April 22 from 576B-1, a coffin silo. The next attempt, 23D (May 6) began experiencing abnormal pitch gyrations within 10 seconds of launch. After about 20 seconds, the missile started tumbling out of control upon which the RSO sent the destruct command. This failure was attributed to wiring in the pitch gyro contacting the casing and shorting out the gyro motor. Atlas 74D (July 22) broke up 70 seconds into launch due to a failure of the pitch gyro either due to an improper motor speed setting or torquing signals. Missile 47D (September 12) lost sustainer thrust due to a leak in the vernier helium supply system. Missile 33D (September 29) failed to stage its booster section when the staging electrical disconnect plug pulled out at T+125 seconds. 81D (October 13) failed when the LOX quick disconnect pressure sensor malfunctioned due to the loss of a heat shield at liftoff, causing the pneumatic system to overpressurize the LOX tank with helium until it ruptured the intermediate bulkhead and destroyed the missile at T+72 seconds.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 81D October 27, 1960\\" Three successful Atlas D flights took place from CCAS during June 1960. Missile 60D on July 2 experienced an electrical short which caused several spurious vents and repressurizations of the helium supply, caused the sustainer engine to lose thrust. It impacted 60 miles short of the target point in the South Atlantic. Missile 32D on August 9 and 66D on August 12 were both successful, although the latter's RV was lost at sea. Five more Atlas D tests from CCAS during the year were successful. The most notable of these was Atlas 71D on October 13 which carried three mice and other experiments in a biological nose cone which successfully completed a 5000-mile lob downrange from LC-11 at the Cape. This missile utilized a dry start method without any hold-down time at liftoff with no apparent ill effects and all airborne systems performed well aside from an unexplained decrease in B-1 and sustainer thrust a few seconds before BECO. Cameras mounted on the nose cone photographed the spent Atlas after capsule separation.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 71D.\\" Convair, 29 October 1960 =1961-62= Atlas 90D, the final R&D; flight of a D-series missile, launched successfully from LC-12 on January 23, 1961. Four operational Atlas D flights from VAFB during the year were successful and the first three flights of 1962 also went without a hitch. Atlas 52D launched from 576-B3 at VAFB on February 21, 1962. Abnormal thrust section temperatures occurred early in the flight, and the sustainer and verniers shut down starting at T+47 seconds. The booster engines shut down at T+68 seconds, and the missile broke up four seconds later. This failure was traced to a leak in the booster engine gas generator that caused thrust section overheating and loss of engine thrust, and it occurred a mere five hours after John Glenn's Mercury launch, driving home the point that Atlas was still far from a reliable vehicle.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 52D March 3, 1962\\" The next flight after 52D was Missile 134D (March 24), witnessed by President Kennedy, who was making a tour of VAFB. Eight successful Atlas D operational flights in a row followed, some of which tested Nike-Zeus target missiles. On September 10, Missile 4D failed when the vernier engines shut down due to an inadvertent closure of the propellant valves. Aside from loss of roll control, the propellant feed system sent all of the propellant intended for the verniers into the sustainer engine, which was overpressurized beyond its structure limits. The sustainer shut down about two and a half minutes into launch, likely due to a rupture from the excessive pressure level, and the missile fell well short of its target.\\"Flight Evaluation Report, Missile 4D September 24, 1962\\"Three more Atlas D flights during the year were successful. =1963= After the high degree of success achieved in 1962, the flight record of the D-series took a turn for the worse in 1963. The first flight of the year, Missile 39D, went awry when high thrust section temperatures caused total propulsion system failure two minutes into launch. The malfunction was traced to the sustainer insulation boot breaking off at liftoff, which allowed exhaust gases to recirculate in the thrust section. Three Atlas Ds then successfully tested Nike-Zeus target missiles. On March 10, Atlas 102D was launched on an operational test from 576-B3. The missile began to tumble out of control shortly after liftoff and self-destructed at T+33 seconds, showering the area around the pad with flaming debris. Investigation of the failure found that the pitch gyro spin motor was either not running or the rotation speed was too low, and that 102D was still using the old Type B gyro canisters which did not have the Spin Motor Rotation Detection System (SMRD). The SMRD had been conceived back in 1958 after the first Atlas B failed in flight due to an inoperative yaw gyro, but was not phased into Atlas vehicles until 1961. Missile 102D had not been upgraded to the newer Type D gyros which had the SMRD, and a quick examination of the Atlas inventory at VAFB found two more missiles with Type B gyros. They were replaced with spare Type D canisters from Project Mercury.\\"Flight Test Evaluation Report, Missile 102D March 27, 1963\\" After a successful launch on March 12, Missile 46D (March 15) failed when the sustainer hydraulic rise-off heat shield broke off. Radiated heat caused the rise-off disconnect valve to fail, resulting in loss of sustainer engine hydraulic fluid. After booster jettison, the missile tumbled and fell into the Pacific Ocean less than 500 miles downrange. This incident was a near repeat of a failed Atlas-Agena launch three months earlier, and after another Atlas-Agena the following June fell victim to a hydraulic rise-off heat shield loss, the heat shield was redesigned. Check valves were installed on the hydraulic system of Atlas SLVs, although not ICBMs. Missile 193D (March 16) experienced a similar failure to 39D, which resulted in improved stitching of the engine insulation boots. D-series operational tests were suspended for two months while efforts were made to correct the problems experienced during the first few months of 1963. Then 198D carried out a Nike-Zeus test successfully on June 12. Two operational ICBM tests in July-August were also successful. Missiles 63D and 84D on September 9 and 11 lost thrust and tumbled during the sustainer phase, in the first case due to a ruptured vernier hydraulic line, in the second due to thrust section overheating. On October 7, Missile 163D exploded at T+75 seconds when the intermediate bulkhead reversed. Postflight investigation found that launch crews had loaded the helium bottles with insufficiently chilled gas, resulting in a lack of helium flow to the propellant tanks, which lost pressure during ascent. The last operational Atlas D missile test was Missile 158D on November 13. The sustainer hydraulic system failed during ascent and the missile lost attitude control and self- destructed 120 seconds into launch. Because this was the program finale, Convair did not perform a full postflight investigation and the cause of the hydraulic failure was not determined. One more Atlas D was flown in 1963, an ABRES RV test on December 18, successfully. =1964-65= On April 23, 1964, Missile 263D launched from CCAS LC-12 as part of Project FIRE, a series of suborbital tests designed to verify Apollo command module ablative heat shield material. This was the first suborbital Atlas D flown from the Cape in over three years. Five RV/Nike-Zeus tests from VAFB during the year achieved most of their mission goals. The Atlas ICBM program concluded in early 1965, however refurbished missiles continued to be flown from VAFB for various orbital and suborbital mission for years afterward. Six successful RV/Nike- Zeus flights were carried out using D-series missiles from January to April 1965. On May 22, the second Project FIRE test was performed from the Cape using Missile 264D. During 1965, another new program developed, the OV (Orbiting Vehicle) flights, which were a series of experimental scientific pods. The first attempt using Atlas 172D miscarried when an incorrectly set sustainer PU valve caused fuel depletion and premature SECO. The guidance system did not issue the separation command to the pods, which remained attached to the sustainer section as it reentered the atmosphere and burned up. The second attempt, using Missile 68D on May 28, was an even bigger fiasco when a LOX leak during ascent resulted in a thrust section explosion two minutes into launch. Although booster jettison was performed successfully, damage from the explosion resulted in eventual sustainer shutdown and missile self-destruction. Afterwards, it was decided that suborbital flights were insufficient for the OV program and that full orbital tests were needed. Most Atlas D launches were sub-orbital missile tests; however several were used for other missions, including orbital launches of crewed Mercury, and uncrewed OV1 spacecraft. Two were also used as sounding rockets as part of Project FIRE. A number were also used with upper stages, such as the RM-81 Agena, to launch satellites. The Atlas D was deployed in limited numbers as an ICBM due to its radio guidance while the fully operational E and F-series missiles had inertial guidance packages and a different ignition system that allowed faster engine starts. For Mercury, the Atlas D was used to launch four crewed Mercury spacecraft into low Earth orbit. The modified version of the Atlas D used for Project Mercury was designated Atlas LV-3B. Atlas Ds used for space launches were custom-built for the needs of the mission they were performing, but when the Atlas was retired from missile service in 1965, Convair introduced a standardized Atlas vehicle (the SLV-3) for all space missions. Remaining D-series missiles were flown until 1967 for suborbital tests of reentry vehicles and a few space launches. A total of 116 D-series missiles (not including vehicles used for space launches) were flown from 1959‚Äì67 with 26 failures. Warhead The warhead of the Atlas D was originally the G.E. Mk 2 \\"heat sink\\" re-entry vehicle (RV) with a W49 thermonuclear weapon, combined weight and yield of 1.44 megatons (Mt). The W-49 was later placed in a Mk 3 ablative RV, combined weight The Atlas E and F had an AVCO Mk 4 RV containing a W-38 thermonuclear bomb with a yield of 3.75 Mt which was fuzed for either air burst or contact burst. The Mk 4 RV also deployed penetration aids in the form of mylar balloons which replicated the radar signature of the Mk 4 RV. The Mk 4 plus W-38 had a combined weight of .

History The airport was built by Indian Defence Authorities in September 1948 during the police action operation on the ex-Hyderabad State. The base, however, was not maintained after the operation. It was re-built in 1987 and was run and maintained by the Public Works Department. Kingfisher Red operated an ATR 72 service to Mumbai in February 2009 four times a week but was discontinued in August 2010. Proposed New Airport Citing lack of space for expansion, The State Government has taken a decision to develop a new Green Field \\"Code-D\\" airport at a cost of Rs. 310 Crores near Boramani village about 15 Kilometres North- east from the current airport. Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) is acquiring about 650 Ha. of land for developing and developing the commercial area around the airport to support this airport 549.34 hectares of which is already government land. Solapur airport has been listed as one among 51 new low-cost airports that were announced by the Government in July 2013. MADC decided in October 2013 that it would develop Boramani airport by forming a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in the form of joint venture company (JVC) with the Airports Authority of India (AAI). AAI will have a 51 per cent stake in the JVC, while MADC will have 49 per cent. The present value of the land at Boramani and the amount required for rehabilitation of project-affected persons will be treated as MADC's share on the state government's behalf. AAI will keep the existing Hotgi airport in Solapur fully operational until Boramani becomes operational after which, Hotgi airport property will be commercially exploited by the JVC.

The airfield is now converted into a full-fledged Army Aviation Base where training is imparted to all candidates at the Combat Army Aviation Training School (CATS) at Nashik. The Cheetah helicopter simulator has been set up at Combat Army Aviation Training School (CATS). It is expected to reduce substantial cost in training and also to reduce pilot risk during training. The simulator is designed to expose the trainee to different weather conditions like snow, rain, storm and different terrains in addition to night flying training in handling emergencies, tactical handling of the flying machine, its different maneuvers and more. The project to install a simulator was proposed in December 2000 and approved in April 2002, with CATS Nashik chosen as the centre for installation. Macmet Technologies Ltd, which won the bid over Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), completed the project by 2005 at a cost of Rs 16.26 crore.

Born Philipp Jutzi in Altleiningen as the son of a tailor, Jutzi was self-educated. (He seems to have been generally known by the Palatinate dialect form of his given name, Piel, but a lawsuit by Harry Piel forced him to go by \\"Phil,\\" though many journalists continued to use \\"Piel.\\"Jelavich, Berlin Alexanderplatz, p. 290.) In 1916 he made posters for a small movie theater in the Black Forest, having been rejected by the military during World War I because of a physical disability. In 1919 he was an administrator of the Internationale Film-Industrie company in Heidelberg, which specialized in detective movies and westerns. In 1923 he married Emmy Philippine Zimmermann, the sister of the actor Holmes Zimmermann (born Johannes Zimmermann, 1900‚Äì1957), who acted in seven of his films;filmportal.de biography in May 1926 a daughter, Gisela, was born. In 1925 Jutzi moved to Berlin, where he worked as a documentary cameraman for the Communist film company Welt-Film; in 1928/29 he directed the semidocumentary film The Shadow of a Mine. From 1926 he worked as a director for the leftist Prometheus Film, and on the basis of such films as Mother Krause's Journey to Happiness (1929) became known as a leading director of proletarian films. At the beginning of 1928 he became a member of the Communist Party, but left it at the end of 1929. After the completion of Berlin-Alexanderplatz (1931), based on the Alfred D√∂blin novel, his political orientation changed drastically. In March 1933 Jutzi joined the Nazi Party, and under the Nazi regime became a prolific director, from 1933 to 1941 directing 49 short films (he was rarely allowed to make feature movies because of his political past). In 1934/35 he directed the German spy film Asew with Fritz Rasp and Olga Chekhova, following it with the Austrian spy drama The Cossack and the Nightingale with Iv√°n Petrovich und Jarmila Novotn√°. But he was not by any means a renowned director, and continued to have financial difficulties until the end of his life. During the 1940s his health worsened and he became unfit for work.

Development The P-12 Yenisei was a development of the earlier P-10 radar, the P-12 being developed between 1954 and 1956. The P-12 was developed by the SKB Design Bureau, a division of State Plant No.197 named after V. I. Lenin who developed the previous P-10, the predecessor of the current Nizhny Novgorod Research Institute of Radio Engineering (NNIIRT). The Yenisei radar was accepted into service in 1956 following the successful completion of the radars test program. In 1958 a modernised variant of the P-12 passed the testing process and entered into service as the P-12M, the modernised radar featured the ability to shift the radar frequency within a range of 10 MHz. A further modernisation came in 1962 in the form of the P-12MP which featured improved reliability, reduced side lobe radiation and the ability to be paired with a centimeter band search radar, in 1970 the radar was provided with flicker equipment to improve immunity to anti-radiation missiles. The final variant of the P-12 was the P-12NP which was also produced as the P-12NA with a different transport chassis. The P-12NP compared with the previous P-12MP featured improved detection ranges and reliability as well as the ability to locate the control cabin up to 500 meters from the antenna to improve crew survivability as a result of attack on the radar. Description The main differences between the earlier P-10 and the P-12 included a new antenna feed system with lower side lobes, reduced to 4% of the main lobe. The P-12 also offered a greater frequency range and greater frequency agility, being able to retune to four pre-set frequencies automatically as well as automatic frequency fine tuning. Finally Yenisei had greater accuracy with improved detection range (250 km) and better protection against passive and active interference. In addition to frequency agility the P-12 was the first Russian radar system to use the coherent cancellation moving target indicator (MTI) method to eliminate ground clutter. P-12 radar indicators, E-scope left and plan position indicator right The P-12 \\"Spoon Rest A\\" was mounted on two Zil trucks, though later with the P-12NP \\"Spoon Rest B\\" the radar antenna mast was mounted on a separate trailer cabin to allow for location away from the other components of the radar site, the P-12NA returned to a track based platform. The P-12 used a single antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, the antenna was composed of twelve Yagi antenna mounted in sets of six with one set above the other. Azimuth was scanned mechanically by the antenna with a rotation of 10 r.p.m, elevation was determined using a Goniometer by comparing the phase comparison between the upper and lower antenna sets, in similar fashion to the original P-3 but since this reduced range it was rarely used. The P-12 used two indicators, a plan position indicator in addition to an E-scope to indicate height, the P-12 could integrate track information from an additional radar with both sets of information appearing on the plan position indicator A secondary radar for IFF was generally used in conjunction with the P-12 such as the NRZ-12 (NATO \\"Score Board\\").

One particularly notable incident took place during the War of Attrition in 1969 when Israeli commandos captured a P-12 radar station from Egypt in Operation Rooster 53. Operators The P-12 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1956 but has since become obsolete and retired from service, replaced by more advanced models entering into service after the P-12 such as the P-18 radar. The P-12 was also exported to many allies of the Soviet Union including Vietnam and Egypt, often being used as a search radar for the S-75 surface-to- air missile system (SA-2 \\"Guideline\\").

The founding member was Debendranath Tagore, previously of the Brahmo Samaj, eldest son of influential entrepreneur Dwarkanath Tagore, and eventually father to renowned polymath Rabindranath Tagore. In 1859, the Tattwabodhinƒ´ SabhƒÅ were dissolved back into the BrƒÅhmo SamƒÅj by Debendranath Tagore. Tattwabodhini period On 6 October 1839 Debendranath Tagore established Tattvaranjini Sabha which was shortly thereafter renamed the Tattwabodhini (Truth-seekers) Sabha. Initially confined to immediate members of the Tagore family, in 2 years it mustered over 500 members. In 1840 Debendranath published a Bangla translation of Katha Upanishad. A modern researcher describes the Sabha's philosophy as modern middle-class (bourgeois) Vedanta.<2007: Brian Hatcher \\"Journal of American Academy of Religion\\" Among its first members were the \\"two giants of Hindu reformation and Bengal Renaissance, Akshay Kumar Datta \\"who in 1839 emerged from the life of an anonymous squalor-beset individual\\" and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar the \\"indigenous modernizer\\".\\"Brahmo Samaj and the making of modern India, David Kopf, Princeton University press\\", pp 43-57 First Covenant and merger with the Tattwabodhini Sabha On 7th Pous 1765 Shaka (1843) Debendranath Tagore and twenty other Tattwabodhini stalwarts were formally invited by Pt.

Charles Dall (a Unitarian minister of Boston) arrived in Calcutta to start his mission and immediately established contact with Debendranath and other Brahmos. Debendranath's suspicion of foreigners alienated Dall and in 1857, Debendranath Tagore barred the entry of the Reverend from the Sabha premises for preaching the name of Christ who some people worship as God within.\\"The Brahmo Samaj and making of Modern India\\", David Kopf, publ. Princeton Univ.\\"Brahmoism, or a history of reformed Hinduism\\" (1884), R.C.Dutt Debendranath then proceeded on spiritual retreat to Simla. Dall, immediately formed a counter group \\"The friends of Rammmohun Roy Society\\" and then got admitted a prot√©g√© to Sabha. The presence of Dall's prot√©g√© Keshub Chandra Sen (a non-Brahmin) into the Calcutta Brahmo Sabha in 1857 while Debendranath was away in Simla caused considerable stress in the movement, with many long time Tattvabodhini Brahmin members publicly leaving the Brahmo Sabha and institutions due to his high-handed ways. In September 1858, Debendranath returned to Calcutta to resolve the simmering disputes. but his conservative mien did not allow him to take decisive steps. He proceeded on a sea voyage to Ceylon accompanied by Sen and his 2nd son Satyendranath (a firm admirer of Mr Sen) but no concord was achieved. In 1859, the venerable and beloved Secretary of the Tattwabodhini Sabha Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar resigned from the Brahmo Sabha in the face of Debendranath's vacillation. A meeting of the Tatwabodhini was promptly summoned with Debendranath resigning from the group he had founded. His third son Hemendranath Tagore then a boy barely 15 years in age, and the favorite pupil of Vidyasgar, was commonly acclaimed as Debendranath's successor to head the Tattwabodhini. In the course of time he would become known as the MahaAcharya (or Great Teacher). Objectives and beliefs The main objective of the SabhƒÅ was to promote a more rational and humanist form of Hinduism based on the VedƒÅnta, the Upanishads that form the last part of the VedƒÅs. With increasing missionary presence in Calcutta tending to view the Classical branch of 'Advaida' VedƒÅnta as amoral and renunciatory, the Tattwabodhinƒ´ SabhƒÅ aimed to shield themselves and their reformed faith from criticism by distancing themselves from this 'outdated' version. Debendranath Tagore said in 1843 that \\"It was to counteract influences like these [missionary] and inculcate on the Hindu religious inquirer's mind doctrines at once consonant to reason and human nature, for which he has to explore his own sacred resources, the VedƒÅnta, that the society was originally established\\".Ali, M.M; Bengali reaction...; pp 17, 19. This focus on rationality and humanity, whilst alleviating Missionary pressure, also allowed the materially wealthy 'bhadralok' members of the society to participate in a spiritual medium which did not condemn worldly concern. The group's writings, particularly the recently rediscovered 'Sabhyadiger Vakt·πõtƒÅ',c.f. Hatcher, B; Bourgeois Hinduism display a marked stress upon the role of the 'householder' (g·πõhastha) as a religious path, over that of the renouncer or hermit. The Brahman, like the renouncer, must restrain his senses and passions, but only to the extent of not becoming obsessed with, or overcome by, anything in the material world. Essentially, the Tattwabodhinƒ´ SabhƒÅ's humanism is displayed in a profound focus on society and its interrelation. Their view, at least in the early years, was that the world is created by God, and all things within it are pathways to knowledge of Brahman, the Ultimate Self, and the ultimate goal. Similarly, they saw that material wealth, if made and possessed with the correct intention - that of helping society and others ‚Äì was in fact not only ethically sound, but an utter necessity for harmonious society. Once again, their rationality is evident.

Vayudoot operated flights to Mumbai for a short while before discontinuing due to runway repairs, shortage of aircraft capacity and paucity of resources. The airstrip was transferred to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation(MIDC) for upgradation, expansion and maintenance in 1997. During the 2008 winter session of the state legislature, the Maharashtra State Cabinet decided to hand over the airport to the Indian Coast Guard for setting up an air station. It proposed to hand over 41 hectares of airport land and another 19 hectares of MIDC land to the defence ministry . MIDC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Airports Authority of India on March 5, 2019, to facilitate civil operations under the UDAN scheme of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The MIDC agree to provide infrastructure for handling of aircraft and passengers such as building the passenger terminal and taxiway, while AAI would provide communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems for air traffic management at the airport.

During this period, he studied at the Liceu de Artes e Oficios de S√£o Paulo, where he took courses on sketching and Fine Arts. =Italian Influence= In the beginning of the 1930s, Aldo decided to move to Florence to attend the Florence Academy of Arts (Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze) where he trained as a painter with the Italian artists Felice Carena and Ennio Pozzi.

Overview In \\"The Knight's Tale\\", published around 1400, English poet Geoffrey Chaucer referred to \\"The smiler with the knife under the cloak\\".Geoffrey Chaucer,\\"The Knight's Tale\\" in Canterbury Tales c 1400. Taken literally, the phrase could refer to using the cloak and dagger in historical European martial arts. The purpose of the cloak was to obscure the presence or movement of the dagger, to provide minor protection from slashes, to restrict the movement of the opponent's weapon, and to provide a distraction. Fencing master Achille Marozzo taught and wrote about this method of combat in his book, Opera Nova. Fighting this way was not necessarily seen as a first choice of weapons, but may have become a necessity in situations of self-defense if one were not carrying a sword, with the cloak being a common garment of the times that could be pressed into use as a defensive aid. Both Marozzo and other masters such as Di Grassi also taught the use of the cloak with the rapier.DiGrassi, His True Arte of Defence The entire Di Grassi manual translated into English.UNC.edu A version of \\"The Rapier and Cloake\\" that is easier to read and includes an illustration. The metaphorical meaning of the phrase dates from the early 19th century. It is a translation from the French de cape et d'√©p√©e and Spanish de capa y espada (\\"of cloak and sword\\"). These phrases referred to a genre of swashbuckler drama in which the main characters wore these items. In 1840, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, \\"In the afternoon read La Dama Duende of Calder√≥n ‚Äì a very good comedy of 'cloak and sword'.\\" Charles Dickens subsequently used the phrase \\"cloak and dagger\\" in his work Barnaby Rudge a year later as a sarcastic reference to this style of drama. The imagery of these two items became associated with the archetypal spy or assassin: the cloak, worn to hide one's identity or remain hidden from view, and the dagger, a concealable and silent weapon. In contemporary culture The sword fight in Peter Martins' ballet of Romeo + Juliet culminates in Romeo stabbing Tybalt repeatedly in the back with a dagger, having flung his cloak over the latter's head. Cloak and Dagger are also the names of two Marvel Comics characters debuting in 1982.

Because of their resemblance to each other, people around them believe them to be twins and give them the names Poucy and Thumb. They live with their adoptive mother, maman Janine, in north of France. These girls have been joined like two fingers on one hand since they were children. In due course, they begin to find out that each day of their lives resembles a day they have lived in the past and maybe even a day to be lived sometime in the future. One day in summer, they decided that the time was right to take control of their dreams. Using their savings and using a little bit of money given to them they bought a ticket down south to Monaco. Arriving in Monte Carlo after such a long journey (it never seemed to end ) they treat themselves to a luxury holiday. They made the stop-over to Italy when their finances were nearly fully depleted and there they stole things, principally food, and there they slept on the beach.

In 1818 it built its first church at its current lot on Perry Street. In 1957 its ninth pastor the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker (1953‚Äì1959), co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led the congregation in the Civil Rights Movement in Petersburg. It continues to serve the community today. History The church originated in Prince Edward County, Virginia, in 1786, as the Davenport Church. In 1797, it was recognized as a separate institution with an integrated congregation which also included slave and free members. In 1800, the black majority of Davenport Church moved to Pocahontas Island, the center of the growing free black community of Petersburg.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 143, accessed 27 Dec 2008 It took the name of Sandy Beach Baptist Church. In 1818, the church members purchased a lot on Perry Street in the Gillfield neighborhood of central Petersburg (named for Revolutionary veteran Erasmus Gill who laid out the streets before 1798James H. Bailey, Old Petersburg, p. 17.). They built the first of what would be four successive church buildings at this site. The current church was constructed from 1874‚Äì1879.\\"Gillfield Baptist Church, Petersburg, Virginia\\" , Church Minutes Collection, Virginia Commonwealth University Library, accessed 27 Dec 2008 These were the earliest decades of the Baptist Church in Virginia, influenced by preachers from New England who generated revivals. As more churches were started, members came together in an association in the southeast. In 1781 it split into two parts along state lines for Virginia and North Carolina. The twenty-one congregations in Virginia formed the Portsmouth Baptist Association. Representatives worked together to form church policy. From 1810 to 1828 they began to work on Foreign Missions and Christian Education. \\"History of the Portsmouth Baptist Association\\", Official Website, accessed 31 Dec 2008 Admitted to the Portsmouth Baptist Association in 1810, Gillfield Baptist then had 270 members.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 143, accessed 27 Dec 2008 Free blacks continued to migrate to Petersburg. By 1821 Gillfield Baptist had the largest congregation within the association. At 441 members, it was more than twice as large as the next ranking church.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 188, accessed 27 Dec 2008 While it had free blacks taking active roles, the church was led by white pastors in some of its early years. In addition, through the regional Baptist associations, whites tried to keep control over black congregations. They also began to restrict activities by black members. In 1829 the Portsmouth Baptist Association tried to force the congregation of Gillfield Baptist into a consolidation with the white congregation of Market Street Church. It was another way for whites to try to exert control over a congregation. The Gillfield members resisted and stayed at their own church. But, that year they did have to accede to having members of Market Street Church represent them in Portsmouth Association meetings, a situation that lasted until after the American Civil War and emancipation. For years before this, they had been represented by free blacks such as Israel Decoudry, of West Indian descent. In 1838 the Gillfield congregation made another appeal to the Portsmouth Association to select their own delegate, but they were refused.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 188, accessed 27 Dec 2008 After Nat Turner's slave rebellion of 1831, the state legislature passed a bill requiring that every congregation have a white minister leading it, to try to control the message which congregations would hear. They wanted preachers to stress the duty of blacks to stay in their places. Minutes of church and association meetings show they struggled with issues of Christianity within a slave society. The pressures and narrow edge kept by black congregations can be demonstrated by the fact that Gillfield Baptist dismissed more than one enslaved member for running away.Albert J. Raboteau, Slave Religion: The 'Invisible Institution' in the Antebellum South, Oxford University Press, p. 145, accessed 27 Dec 2008 They upheld an ideal of duty over the person's desire to be free. After the Civil War, in 1865 the congregation called Reverend Henry Williams (1831‚Äì1900) as the first black minister of Gillfield Baptist Church since 1831. \\"The Reverend Henry Williams' Papers\\", Virginia Heritage: Brown vs. Board of Education Resources, Virginia State University, 2004, accessed 30 Dec 2008 He served as the pastor from 1865‚Äì1900, leading the congregation through major changes during and after the Reconstruction era. The church left the Portsmouth Association and joined a state black Baptist convention, aided by the Consolidated American Baptist Convention, to escape the supervision of whites. This was the forerunner of the National Baptist Convention, USA. Like many ministers, Williams was a leader in the larger community as well. He was elected to the City Council of Petersburg during Reconstruction.\\"The Reverend Henry Williams' Papers\\", Virginia Heritage: Brown vs. Board of Education Resources, Virginia State University, 2004, accessed 30 Dec 2008 A leading advocate of black teachers for black students, Williams encouraged students in teaching careers.

Powell began his ministry at Gillfield, eggs were thrown at his door, he received threatening phone calls at home at midnight, and a cross was burned in front of the church during a 1963 revival service (for which police soon arrested a suspect).Grady W.

It should not be confused with the Railway Executive which was a division of the British Transport Commission. In both cases, this period of government control was followed by a major re-organisation of the railways. World War I The Railway Executive Committee (REC) was formed in 1912 to act as an intermediary between the War Office and the various British railway companies. The companies were already involved in the transport of many thousands of troops during annual manoeuvres and it was realised that better coordination and planning would be required if the United Kingdom were to enter into a future European war. In 1911, the companies began to plan for the movement of troops, horses and equipment to the embarkation ports, chiefly Southampton, in case of mobilisation; the main role of the REC was to oversee this work. When completed, the orders for this complicated plan that were issued to the various railways were known as the \\"War Book\\". Using legislation that had been enacted in 1871, the REC took control of the national rail network on 4 August 1914, the day that war was declared and mobilisation began.Doyle, Peter (2012) First World War Britain, Shire Publications Ltd, (p. 58) Alexander Kaye Butterworth was appointed chairman. REC control lasted from 1914 to 1921. It was followed by the Railways Act 1921 which led to the creation of the Big Four British railway companies in 1923. Herbert Ashcombe Walker was acting chairman of the REC in January 1917. World War IIPreparation= The REC was re-formed on 24 September 1938 with a remit to run the British railways if war broke out. The railways would later be brought under government control through the REC under the direction of the Ministry of Transport. The Big Four railway companies, comprising the Great Western Railway (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), and the Southern Railway (SR), along with the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) were initially represented by Sir Ralph Wedgwood (chairman) for LNER, Sir James Milne (deputy chairman) for GWR, Sir William Wood for LMS, Gilbert Szlumper for SR, and Frank Pick for LTPB. The secretary of the committee was G. Cole Deacon from the Railway Companies Association (RCA). Initially the role of the REC was advisory, and coordinated the existing emergency plans and preparations of the railway companies and the Railway Technical Committee (RTC) for such matters as civilian evacuation and air raid precautions. At first, the offices of the REC were at Fielden House in Westminster. Unlike the railway companies, which were planning to move their headquarters out of London, the REC remained in London to stay in close contact with the government. The basement in Fielden House was unsuitable, so the unused Down Street tube station was converted into bomb-proof underground offices to become the headquarters of REC. The only available space was on the platforms, but Piccadilly Line trains still passed through the station. Under great secrecy, new walls were built at night when the trains had stopped running. The doors to the new headquarters were fitted with gas locks, and short, secret, platforms were added, where REC members and senior staff could stop a train and travel in the cab to the next station. The new headquarters included offices, dormitories (with space for 12 senior officials and 22 members of staff), kitchens, and mess rooms. =Outbreak of war= The Minister of Transport, Euan Wallace, took control of the railways on 1 September 1939 (two days before Britain declared war on Germany). Control was taken using the Emergency (Railway Control) Order under the powers granted by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939. The companies affected included the Big Four (and any joint companies operated by them), LPTB, East Kent Railway, Kent and East Sussex Railway, King's Lynn Docks and Railway Company, Mersey Railway, and Shropshire and Montgomery Railway. To save money on fuel and reduce the demands on the railways the REC ordered various restrictions on passenger services which came into effect on 11 September 1939: passenger train services were reduced in number and speeds were restricted; various reduced fares were discontinued; reservations of seats, compartments, and saloons were discontinued; restaurant car services were withdrawn; and the number of sleeping car services were reduced. REC control lasted from 1939 until the railways were nationalised in 1948. =Publicity= Some of the cartoons of Carl Giles were reprinted in poster form for World War II Railway Executive Committee.

Czerwone maki na Monte Cassino (The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino) is one of the best-known Polish military songs of World War II. It was composed in May 1944 in Italy, during the Battle of Monte Cassino, on the eve of the Polish Army's capture of the German stronghold. History In early 1944 a German stronghold, dug in at the ancient Benedictine monastery atop Monte Cassino, had blocked the Allies' advance toward Rome. The forces of several Allied countries had attempted since mid- January to capture the German fortress. For a fourth major assault, which would begin on 11 May 1944, Polish troops were rotated in. The song's melody was composed during the night of 17‚Äì18 May 1944 by Alfred Sch√ºtz, a composer, actor and member of the Polish Soldiers' Theater garrisoned at Campobasso in the shadow of Monte Cassino. Two opening stanzas were written at that time by Feliks Konarski (\\"Ref-ren\\" ‚Äî \\"Refrain\\"), a poet and songwriter and soldier of the Polish II Corps commanded by Major General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders. The third stanza would be written a few days later. The third verse, Konarski wrote several hours later. In his memoirs, he wrote: \\"For the first time singing Red poppies on Monte Cassino, we all cried. Soldiers cried with us. Red poppies, which bloomed over night, became one more symbol of bravery and sacrifice - a tribute of alive ones, whom for love of freedom died for freedom of people.\\" The fourth and final stanza would be written a quarter-century later, in 1969, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the battle. That final stanza is the least known and is sometimes omitted. On 18 May 1944, the day following the song's composition, the Poles stormed and captured the precincts of the Monte Cassino monastery. Later that day, the song was first performed at General Anders' headquarters to celebrate the Polish victory. The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino won popularity with the troops and was soon published by a Polish- American newspaper in New York. It would later be published in Poland. It was banned, however, during the Stalinist period in the People's Republic of Poland, when the government sought to minimize memory of the wartime Polish Armed Forces in the West.

The E23 underwent a conversion for use as a vector weapon and was briefly used in large-scale entomological warfare trial but technical issues forced it from the tests. History The E23 munition was originally conceived as an anti-crop weapon. When, following the Korean War, U.S. interest in large-scale entomological warfare increased, the E23 was one of two munitions involved in field testing the potential of insect vectors as weapons.Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History, (Google Books), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 304, (). Specifications The E23 was made of cardboard and had a diameter of and a length of . Essentially a cardboard container, the E23 consisted of an internal actuator which simply reversed a plastic bag, expelling its contents. The E23 sub- munition also included a small parachute for use when dropped from the E77 cluster bomb. The weapon was deployed between 2,000 and 1,000 feet in altitude after its release from the cluster bomb. Once converted for use as a vector weapon the E23 could hold 200,000 rat fleas in its interior among small pieces of sponge. Issues Initially, the E23 was involved in \\"Operation Big Itch\\". In September 1954 Big Itch aimed to determine coverage patterns and survivability of uninfected tropical rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) for use in biological warfare as disease vector.The tropical rat flea is a known vector for bubonic plague. See: Trivedi, \\"Xenopsylla cheopis\\".Rose, William H. \\"An Evaluation of Entomological Warfare as a Potential Danger to the United States and European NATO Nations\\", U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, Dugway Proving Ground, March 1981, via thesmokinggun.com, accessed December 28, 2008. In preliminary Big Itch tests approximately half of the E23 munitions failed to properly function. In one instance, the problems with the E23 led uninfected fleas to escape into the aircraft where they bit the pilot, bombardier and an observer. These problems led to the E23 being pulled off of Operation Big Itch.Kirby, Reid. \\"Using the flea as weapon\\", (Web version via findarticles.com), Army Chemical Review, July 2005, accessed December 28, 2008.

Retrieved 31 August 2013. and closed after the end of the International Geophysical Year (IGY). It is now often visited by Antarctic cruise ships but is otherwise unoccupied. Thanks to the men's hasty departure and the necessity that they take little with them, Base W is an eerily preserved time capsule of 1950s Antarctic life. The base had been intended to host dog-sledging survey parties which would cross the sea ice to the nearby Antarctic Peninsula, but the ice was dangerously unstable. When Base W was vacated, heavy sea ice prevented resupply ship Biscoe from approaching closer than , despite the assistance of two U.S. icebreakers. So the men were forced to close up the base, load sledges with only their most valuable gear and use dog teams to reach the ship. Station W Station W was established in 1956 as a British research station primarily for survey, geology and meteorology and to contribute to the International Geophysical Year in 1957. It consists of a hut and associated structures and outbuildings, including a small emergency storage building, bitch and pup pens, anemometer tower, and two tubular steel radio masts. As a relatively unaltered research station of the late 1950s, it provides a reminder of the science and living conditions that existed when the Antarctic Treaty was first signed in 1959. In 2009, the base was designated a Historic Site and Monument (HSM 83), following a proposal by the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Artefacts include a Hoover washing machine with instruction manuals, jackets and longjohns, a calendar from December 1957, survey books, astronomical observation logs, radio communication equipment, numerous books, dozens of paint-size cans of Scotch oats, bottles of Heinz mayonnaise, and empty bottles of gin and whisky. Detaille Island is maintained by the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust.United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust The organization works to conserve Antarctic buildings and artefacts, and to promote and encourage the public's interest in its Antarctic heritage. The normal occupancy of Station W was eight to 10 people, according to an information panel. In addition to the main building, there are two nearby huts. One was used as an emergency store and the other to keep dogs.

Routes  The main routes to Mongolia are either the Northern Route, from London to Mongolia via Moscow, or the Southern Route, via Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia.  Entry fees  The Mongolia Charity Rally charges an entry fee that is aimed at covering the costs of running the event. All excess funds that are generated from entry fees are donated to a project started by Go Help that provides riding helmets to child jockeys taking part in Mongolian Naadam festivals, a project that was covered by Mongolian television in 2008.Mongolian television feature on Go Help and the CDPF to provide riding helmets to Child Jockeys in Mongolia The entry fee for the Mongolia Charity Rally 2010 is ¬£300 for teams signing up before October 1, after which the invitation is by invitation only. The entry fee for 2009 was also ¬£300, which is less than half the entry fee of ¬£650 charged in 2009 by a competing rally run by a profit making company. The 2008 entry fee was ¬£150. The increase reflected two major additions to Go Help's budget: the hiring of an employee in Mongolia to oversee vehicle sales and to monitor the application of funds raised by Charity Ralliers, and the costs of full-time development of the Charity Rallies website.

After completing Officer Candidate School he became an infantry officer a and returned to the Paratroopers Brigade as a platoon leader.

Between the years 1996‚Äì1997 he Commanded the Eastern brigade of Lebanon Liaison Unit and afterwards served as the head of the Operations section in the Operations Directorate. During the Second Intifada, Golan commanded the Nahal Infantry Brigade.Gal Perl Finkel, IDF promotes officers who think outside the box, but still follow the line, The Jerusalem Post, 18 June 2018.

In July 2011 he served as the Commander of Israeli Northern Command, and in December 2014 as Deputy Chief of General Staff. Golan was replaced by Aluf Aviv Kochavi in May 2017. Holocaust Day Speech Golan made a speech on Holocaust Day in 2016 in which some say he draw a parallel between Germany in the 1930s and current day Israel, by saying \\"If there is one thing that is scary in remembering the Holocaust, it is noticing horrific processes which developed in Europe ‚Äì particularly in Germany ‚Äì 70, 80, and 90 years ago, and finding remnants of that here (in Israel) among us in the year 2016.\\" He recognized that sometimes Israeli soldiers were harsh in dealing with Palestinians, and he highlighted the example of Sergeant Elor Azaria being tried over a Hebron shooting incident as evidence that the IDF investigates itself and has high moral standards. His comments drew significant criticism on social media, with Twitter users accusing Golan of \\"forgetting the lessons of the Holocaust.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the comments \\"outrageous\\" and said they \\"do injustice to Israeli society and create contempt for the Holocaust.\\" Culture Minister Miri Regev called for his resignation, while opposition leader Isaac Herzog praised Golan for exhibiting \\"morality and responsibility.\\" Later Golan retracted and said that he did not intend to compare Israel to Nazi Germany, releasing a statement in which he said \\"It is an absurd and baseless comparison and I had no intention whatsoever to draw any sort of parallel or to criticise the national leadership. The IDF is a moral army that respects the rules of engagement and protects human dignity.\\" Political life On 26 June 2019, Ehud Barak announced that Golan will join him in forming a new party intent on challenging Netanyahu in the upcoming September 2019 Israeli legislative election. He later joined the Democratic Union alliance to contest the September election. He re-activated the Democratic Choice party in January 2020, becoming its leader and joining the Democratic Union again in advance of the 2020 Israeli legislative election.

He is considered one of the most influential chief factors in the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) during his career, and in recognition of his services was granted a half share in the company's profits for two years beyond the normal retirement period. Christie was reputedly born in Glasgow, Scotland. He joined the Hudson's Bay Company in 1809, working in the lumber trade in Moose Factory. He left for Britain briefly in 1810, but returned in 1811 and established a sawmill. In 1817, now headquartered at Rupert's House, he was placed in charge of the Eastmain region. In 1821 he was a chief factor. He went on furlough in 1824. He was placed in charge of Moose Factory from 1826 to 1830, and then York Factory from 1830 to 1833. He was then appointed Governor of the Red River Colony and the Assiniboia District until 1839. During this term he supervised the building of Lower Fort Garry, which had begun a few years before his appointment in 1831. He also began construction of Upper Fort Garry. Between 1839 and 1844 he was again on furlough, in England and at Moose Factory. From 1844 to 1848 he was involved in attempting to enforce the HBC fur-trading monopoly. However, because he lacked a military force, his results were unsuccessful. Christie's marriage to Anne Thomas, daughter of Thomas Thomas, Sr., was confirmed by the Church of England on February 10, 1835. Two of Christie's sons, Alexander and William Joseph, and a grandson, Alexander, entered the Hudson's Bay Company's service. His son-in-law, John Black was a chief trader at Red River. He died in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1872.

Overall there is very little known about the genus as a whole, most information coming from the Sumatran rabbit. Species The genus Nesolagus includes three species: * Annamite striped rabbit, Nesolagus timminsi * Sumatran striped rabbit, Nesolagus netscheri * Nesolagus sinensis, early Pleistocene of China. Behavior Due to the small number of individuals, and because of the rare sightings of this genus, there is not much information available on its behavior. One thing that we do know however, is that the Sumatran rabbit is nocturnal and hides out in burrows which it does not make itself and does not really like to go out looking for food for itself in places that are too far from its home. Description Descriptions of the species are partly based on images made by camera traps; for the Sumatran striped rabbit the cameras were set in the montane forests of Sumatra, while the Annamite Striped rabbit was seen in the Annamite mountain range of Laos and Vietnam. Both species of striped rabbit have seven brown or black stripes and a red rump and white underside. They are the only species of rabbits to have stripes. They are relatively small with a length of about 368‚Äì417 mm, with a tail of about 17 mm and ears about 43‚Äì45 mm long. Thus the ears of Nesolagus are only about half as long as in most rabbits, e.g. in the genus Lepus. Their fur is soft and dense, overlaid by longer, harsher hairs. Distribution Striped rabbits are found in only four locations. The Sumatran striped rabbit has been found in the Barisan Mountains in western Sumatra, Indonesia, and the Annamite striped rabbit has been found in the Annamite mountains on the border between Vietnam and Laos. The fossils (parts of the left mandible with several teeth) of the extinct Nesolagus sinensis were found in Chongzou Ecological Park in the Guangnxi Zhuang region of southwest China.

Its ten chapters each detail a technology that has the potential to reduce greenhouse gases while being economically and technologically viable in the present or near future. The book received a positive critical response for the way in which it was written and dealt with the issues surrounding Global Warming. Overview The book is divided into ten chapters which deal with a different technology (although there was some contention, as raised by the author, with the 'Soils and Forests' Chapter). Typically every chapter covers the advantages, disadvantages and viability (economically and technologically) of the technology. Goodall doesn‚Äôt cover nuclear power as he believes that it doesn‚Äôt have a potential to become far cheaper. Goodall states that we already have inexpensive technologies that don‚Äôt require us to abandon our ways of life, but they do require some reorganisation of our economies. His point of view is that none of these technologies alone could supply all the world‚Äôs energy needs, but a portfolio of them, can. With regards to wind power, Goodall argues that since the technology to utilise wind efficiently exists currently and there are sufficient sites to supply the world's energy demands (\\"72 terawatts - around thirty times the world's electricity requirements\\"), the main obstacle is reliability. Efficiency of current photovoltaic panels (typically 10%) and the cost (of silicon) are identified as the only remaining problems in rolling out large solar powerplants in places such as North Africa, the Sahara Desert and California, Goodall concludes in the solar energy chapter. Goodall identifies the Pentland Firth as one of twenty global sites that promise 'enormous potential' with tidal-stream power. Cited as the main reason for continued failure to harness the Ocean's 'enormous untapped potential' is a lack of funding, driven by competition in R&D; and a lack of interest; although Goodall is optimistic and admits there have been improvements. Efficient fuel cells applied to domestic homes, the author suggests, may be capable of simultaneously providing hot water, heating and profiting the owner with exports to the local grid. Also discussed are district heating plants, which are widespread in Denmark, able to provide heat to towns and produce electricity. The Introduction explains how the author came to write about the subject. A section called 'Putting it all Together' looks at if the aforementioned ten technologies have the combined potential to 'save the planet'. Finally the Epilogue reveals the reasoning behind why some technologies (e.g. nuclear energy) are not included and may not work. Critical reception Ten Technologies to Save the Planet has received a positive critical response; Mark Lynas, an environmentalist and author of Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet, said \\"Ten Technologies is superb - it cuts like lightning through the myths and muddled thinking surrounding energy issues. It is vital, topical and brilliantly written.\\" BBC Green, said the book was \\"Rewarding and essential, Ten Technologies combines rigorous research and an accessible tone.\\" See also *The Clean Tech Revolution *List of books about energy issues *Surviving the Century: Facing Climate Chaos and Other Global Challenges *Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy References Category:2008 non-fiction books Category:2008 in the environment Category:2009 in the environment Category:Climate change books Category:Self-help books Category:Popular science books ","title":"Ten Technologies to Fix Energy and Climate"},{"id":"20871017","text":"This is a list of ambassadors of the United States to Hungary.

In politics he was a socialist when he left school, and commented in 1985 \\"I voted Labour in 1945 and got disillusioned with the party by the end of the 1940s\\".Hugh Clayton, Emerging figure in new Lib-Lab pact An Alliance shire leader cast in Tory mould, in The Times, 11 May 1985; pg. 2; col C In the 1950s he became a radical Liberal of the age inspired by Jo Grimond, and he was passionate about European unity, state education, and world development.Former councillor dies from The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, Tuesday 9 January 2007Life can be rough for a dog without the right to roam at telegraph.co.uk, 5 July 2001 In 1962, with the support of others, Ainslie re-formed the moribund Devizes Constituency Liberal Association and established the Thrifty Orange in Marlborough, an early charity shop, to raise funds for it. In 1964 he was first elected to Wiltshire County Council, and he continued to represent his rural area at that level for nearly thirty years, until 1993. Although during those years the county was predominantly Conservative, while Ainslie was an outspoken Liberal, he served as chairman of the county's Education Committee from 1973 until 1977.Wiltshire County Council, Clerk's Department at nationalarchives.gov.uk He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in Devizes at the 1974 and 1979 general elections, and when in 1982 the SDP-Liberal Alliance agreed a division of constituencies between its two parties, it was a blow that he had to surrender Devizes to the SDP. Ainslie was a member of the local Alliance negotiating committee for Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, and he gave up his own position in Devizes to allow a younger Liberal to contest Stroud. However, he remained a strong supporter of the Alliance and later of the new Liberal Democrats. In 1979, he contested the first direct elections to the European Parliament as a Liberal and in 1984 fought a strong SDP-Liberal Alliance campaign for the Wiltshire Euro-constituency, gaining over 60,000 votes.Whitaker's Almanack for 1989, p. 280 This campaign helped the Alliance to succeed at the county elections of 1985, when its members found themselves forming the largest political group and Ainslie became Chairman of the County Council, a post he held until 1989. During the same period, he was simultaneously chairman of the county council's Policy (later Policy and Resources) Committee, which made him the de facto Leader of the council, as well. In 1990, Ainslie became the chairman of 'Action for the River Kennet' (ARK), a group he helped foundNigel Kerton, Tributes to political stalwart, Wednesday 10 January 2007, at thisiswiltshire.co.uk which campaigned against pollution and excessive water abstraction.

It was located on Tooley Street which is named after the church, i.e. 't'olous'. It became redundant in 1926 and was demolished. It is now the location of St Olaf House, which houses part of the London Bridge Hospital.  Dedication  Depiction on St Olaf II on the side of St Olaf House The church was dedicated to Olav Haraldsson, an early King of Norway, who attempted to convert his people to Christianity and was martyred in 1030. Before this, in 1014, he was a prince and an ‚Äòally‚Äô (i.e. mercenary) of King √Üthelred the Unready, fighting the Danes. While they were occupying the wooden London Bridge, Olav is said to have tied his long-boats to the bridge supports and pulled it down.Snorri Sturlusson, 'Heimskringla Saga' The church‚Äôs probable beginning is as a private chapel of Godwin, Earl of Wessex from at least 1018, and his Southwark interest was probably contemporary to this. He would probably have known Olav personally, so the dedication was quite apposite. Whatever the veracity of the story of London Bridge, Olav became a popular saint in England, and five churches in the City of London were dedicated to him, apart from the church at Southwark.  Domesday Book  St Olave‚Äôs is presumed to be the church mentioned in the Southwark Domesday Book entry, from which it appears that it had royal patronage before the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. The Domesday entry for Southwark has the following three statements relating to the interests of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and Earl of Kent:Open Domesday Online: Southwark, accessed July 2018. *Qui ecclesiam habebat de rege tenebat. ‚Äò[He] who had the church held [it] from the king‚Äô. This statement is suspiciously vague as to who ‚Äòhad‚Äô the church and just which ‚Äòking‚Äô is being referred to. The royal connection was probably that of Godwin‚Äôs eldest son who succeeded to his Earldom, Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. *Episcopus autem dedit aecclesiam & fluctum primum Adeloldo deinde Radulfo pro excambio unius domus. ‚ÄòThe bishop gave the church & the tidal-stream at first to Adelold, then to Ralph in exchange for a house‚Äô. The ‚Äòtidal stream‚Äô is likely to have been the later ‚ÄòWatergate‚Äô the small dock next to St Olave‚Äôs which was probably its endowment; this dock was progressively filled in from south-end to shore, effectively disappearing by 1747, although a ‚Äòstairs‚Äô/ landing place survived well into the next century. However, there is no confirmation in Domesday that Odo had any legal interest in the church at all, for neither of the terms for ownership i.e. ‚Äòhas‚Äô/ habet or ‚Äòholds‚Äô/ tenet are used. *This gives special weight to the third statement: Vicecomes quoque negat se preceptum uel sigillum regis de hac re unquam percepisse. ‚ÄòThe sheriff also denies that he had ever received the king‚Äôs precept or seal concerning this matter‚Äô. This confirms the ‚Äòking‚Äôs‚Äô interest in the church and calls into question Odo‚Äôs action.Southwark in Domesday: a Reconstruction Tony Sharp, Guildable Manor 2003 Bishop Odo, William the Conqueror‚Äôs half-brother who seems to have succeeded to the Godwin interest, had attempted to let out the church but he should have sought the king‚Äôs authority to do so. The earliest priests of the church were named Adelold (Athelwold) and then Ralph before 1086. The church is first mentioned by name in 1096 in relation to its priest ‚ÄòPeter de St Olavo‚Äô being party to a land transaction involving Bermondsey Priory.Mediaeval Southwark pp20 - 25 Martha Carlin, Hambledon Press 1998  Early Medieval Period  This sword rest, now in Southwark Cathedral, formerly stood in the church. It bears the Bridge Mark (blue logo on right-hand side) of the Bridge House which was nearby. St Olaf House, Southwark Sometime between 1090 and 1121 the Warennes (successors to Odo) had given the church and neighbouring property to Lewes Priory. Although situated next to the old London Bridge, its parish took in the north-east end of the High Street and stretched out along to the east and to the south where it was limited by Bermondsey parish.Carlin op cit The Norman stone church, which replaced a Saxon structure which may have been built of timber, was so close to the river that when a terrible flood affected the banks of the Thames in 1327 it was reported that the water had damaged the church walls and washed away bodies from the churchyard.Annales Bermundsei  Stuart and Georgian era  Part of the Norman building collapsed through a combination of age, neglect, and river subsidence, in 1736. By 1740 this had been replaced by a new church designed by Henry Flitcroft, which in turn was severely damaged in a major fire in Tooley Street in 1843.St Olave's, Southwark, LCC Church History Series Henry Gauntlett was the church's organist from 1827 to 1846 and during those years designed a grand new organ which replaced an older one. The civil parishes of Southwark St Olave, Southwark St John Horsleydown, and Southwark St Thomas, were administered by the St Olave District Board of Works from 1855. The parish also gave its name to the St Olave's Poor Law Union which included the parishes of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, and in 1900 this combination became the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey.

Her many notable descendants include Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Depopulation of the parish, redundancy and demolition of the church  The church was restored and was very much a Docklands church, but as the industrial expansion of the area led to population decline, so the church became less used. In 1926 it was declared redundant and the nave was demolished, leaving a forlorn tower, removed in 1928, when its capping turret was relocated to Tanner Street Park, Southwark, where it was converted into a drinking fountain. This still stands in the Park and in 1998 was designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed structure. The site of the church was sold and redeveloped with an Art Deco office building which became the headquarters of the Hay‚Äôs Wharf Company. This still stands on Lower Tooley Street and is now called St Olaf House; it bears a plaque giving information on the demolished St Olave's Church and its patron saint.  Legacy  The parish church was the originator of St Olave's Grammar School for boys, in 1896 renamed the St Olave's and St Saviour's Grammar School, and from 1902 its foundation also funded the St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School for girls. A separate St Olave's Foundation Fund still supports local youth's educational and vocational aspirations through grants. The St Olave's United Charities parochial foundation, based in nearby Druid Street, is one of the best endowed of the Southwark parish charities, providing for local poor and elderly. The endowment was supplemented until the mid-1990s by a 'parish rate' over the area.St Olave's United Charities Reports to the Charity Commissioners References Category:Former buildings and structures in the London Borough of Southwark Category:Former churches in the London Borough of Southwark Category:Former Church of England church buildings Category:Destroyed churches in London Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1926 ","title":"St Olave's Church, Southwark"},{"id":"20871081","text":"Adolf Hitler's private library was Adolf Hitler's private collection of books, excluding books he purchased for the German state library.

He was appointed the first supervisor of music in Quincy, Illinois in 1888. In 1900 the administration decided that a capitol fund was necessary and eliminated the music supervisor position in the system. For this reason he moved to Keokuk, Iowa to take the position of music supervisor. Hayden founded The School Music Monthly in 1900. In 1904, it became the official publication of National Education Association's Department of Music Education. The periodical was dedicated to a broad spectrum of issues dealing with public school music education. Hayden was editor of this publication for many years and was a frequent contributor. The Beginnings of the MSNC The beginning of the MENC was an invitation by Hayden to come together in Keokuk and observe his work there. The invitation resulted from the cancellation of the 1906 meeting of the National Education Association because of the San Francisco earthquake. The second meeting of the new group was held in Indianapolis in 1909, but a constitution was not adopted until 1910 in Cincinnati, where the group officially became the Music Supervisors National Conference. The appearance of the organization at a time when it could contribute to the expansion of American society in the second and third decades of the twentieth century was due to the foresight of P.C.

The major features different from most Rummy-style games are the limited purchasing (ten) of additional cards and the winner wins all the money used in the game. The rules and strategy are simple enough for all ages to play while still exciting and challenging for an adults only game. Playing with money is not required and anything such as chips or toothpicks may be used. Setup Each player prepares a stack of ten pennies and places it on the table in front of them. These ten pennies must be kept separated from any other money on the table. This stack of ten pennies is referred to as their \\"buy\\" stack of pennies. The players then have an additional amount of money in front of them on the table consisting of all pennies, or any combination of pennies, nickels, dimes or quarters. This additional amount of money, while usually around two dollars, can be added to at any time and needs only be enough to complete the game. This additional money is used to pay for cards \\"caught\\" in a player's hand at the end of each round. A small bowl is needed to collect all pennies and money used in the game. A scorepad is also needed to keep track of penalty points accumulated by each player during the game. The deck Ten Pennies is played with multiple 54-card decks of playing cards (standard 52-card decks plus jokers). Typically, the game is played with one deck for every two players (i.e. 8 players use 4 decks). If there are an odd number of players, it is better to round up (i.e. 7 players use 4 decks). Deuces (2s), Aces and Jokers are wild depending on the round being played. Dealing and cutting Dealership rotates clockwise from round to round. Other people can help shuffle the cards if there are too many for one person to do it adequately. The dealer of the first round is determined by every player drawing a card from the deck. Highest card deals with Jokers being the highest card. If two or more people match the highest card, those people will continue drawing until a dealer is chosen. The dealer deals eleven cards to each player. After all the players' hands have been dealt, another card (the upcard) is placed face-up in a central location known as the discard pile or buy pile. The remainder of the pack is placed face-down and is called the deck or down pile. Play The person to the left of the dealer plays first. This player has the option of picking up the face-up card in the discard pile. If the player does not want the face-up card, the player indicates this by announcing to the other people that he/she does not want the At this point, the person immediately to the left of the player has the option to \\"buy\\" the card. If this person chooses to buy the card, they must use one of their ten pennies from their buy stack and put the penny into the money bowl. After picking up the face-up card, the buyer must also pick up two more cards from the deck. The buyer cannot lay down any cards picked up until it is their turn. If the first person to the left of the player does not want to buy the face-up card, they must verbally declare to the other people that they don't want the card whereby the option goes to the next person to the left. The option goes around the table until either a person buys the card or nobody wants it. If the card is bought, or if the option expires, play resumes with the player. Note: Once a card in the discard pile has been passed over by all players, it cannot then be picked up by the player whose turn it is nor purchased in the future. The player then picks up the top card from the deck. Upon picking up either the discard card or the top card of the pile, the player attempts to satisfy the first down requirements of the round. First-down requirements of each round A \\"set\\" is a group of cards of the same value (i.e. all 8s) or a combination of same valued cards and wild cards as defined by the round. A set may consist of all wild cards or combinations of the same wild cards and other wild cards as long as the requirements of the round are satisfied. Round First-down # of wild cards Number Requirement allowed per set Wild Cards 1 2 sets of 3 1 Deuces (2s) 2 1 set of 4 1 Deuces (2s) 3 2 sets of 4 1 Deuces (2s) 4 1 set of 5 2 Deuces (2s) 5 2 sets of 5 2 Deuces, Aces and Jokers 6 1 set of 6 2 Deuces, Aces and Jokers 7 1 set of 7 3 Deuces, Aces and Jokers If a player whose turn it is has the first-down requirement set of the round, the player has the option of laying down the first requirement set or passing. The player may not lay down any cards until it is their turn and they have first laid down the first-down requirement set. After that, the player has the option of continuing to lay down cards in sets of three or more using no more than one wild card per set of three, although three wild cards or two wild cards and a different wild card may be laid down. Once the player has laid down sets of cards, the player has the option of laying down an unlimited number of wild cards on any set thereby exhausting all wild cards in their hand if they so choose. The player can also lay down any card that can play in any other player's sets. If all cards in the player's hand can either be played or played leaving one discard card, the player then has \\"gone out\\" and wins the round. If, however, the player reaches a point where no other cards can be laid down, the player discards one card face up on the discard pile and the turn passes to the next player to the left. Scoring of the round and paying penalties Once a player goes out, the remaining players add up points of cards they were caught with in their hands. The card values are as follows: 3-9 5 points 10-King 10 points Deuces 20 Points Aces 20 Points Jokers 50 Points The number of points each player was stuck with is tallied on the scorepad. In addition, each player counts the number of cards in their hand and puts a penny into the money bowl for each card in their hand. Strategy Strategy centers on the purchasing of cards using the ten pennies. Purchasing of cards is limited so the timing and reason for purchase must be carefully considered. The reasons for purchasing a card may be: #The face-up card may help satisfy the first down requirement of a round or subsequent laying down of additional cards. #The face-up card may not help but it is hoped the two additional cards drawn might. #The card is bought to prevent others at the table from getting it or the two extra cards. There are several different strategies concerning timing of purchases: #The averaging method is to make one purchase per round and make an extra purchase in the last two rounds. This method can fail if opportunities are missed and you get stuck with many high- point cards. #The go-out-early method uses all purchases in the early rounds to build up a large lead and then high point cards are sloughed in the later rounds. This method fails if a large enough lead is not built up early. #The hold-out method makes few purchases in the early rounds, when it is easier to go out, and saves the purchases to the last few rounds when it is more difficult to make the first down requirements. This method fails if early opportunities are missed and you have too many points going into the final rounds. Successful strategy balances both timing and reasons for purchase. Winning At the completion of the seventh round, all scores are tallied and the player with the lowest score wins the game and all the money in the money bowl.

That is, evaluating any low-degree polynomial at a point determined by the pseudorandom string is statistically close to evaluating the same polynomial at a point that is chosen uniformly at random. Pseudorandom generators for low-degree polynomials are a particular instance of pseudorandom generators for statistical tests, where the statistical tests considered are evaluations of low-degree polynomials. Definition A pseudorandom generator G: \\\\mathbb{F}^\\\\ell \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{F}^n for polynomials of degree d over a finite field \\\\mathbb F is an efficient procedure that maps a sequence of \\\\ell field elements to a sequence of n field elements such that any n-variate polynomial over \\\\mathbb F of degree d is fooled by the output distribution of G. In other words, for every such polynomial p(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n), the statistical distance between the distributions p(U_n) and p(G(U_\\\\ell)) is at most a small \\\\epsilon, where U_k is the uniform distribution over \\\\mathbb{F}^k.

His specialisms included Victorian melodrama and the theatre of Henry Irving, W. S. Gilbert, Oscar Wilde and Arthur Wing Pinero. Biography Rowell lectured in drama at Bristol University from around 1950, joining a fledgling department that consisted of Glynne Wickham, George W. Brandt and John Lavender. Bristol became the first British University to offer Drama as a degree subject‚Äîas distinct from English‚Äîwhen the visionary Vice-Chancellor, Sir Philip Morris, appointed Wickham (then 26) as the first junior academic in Drama in 1947. As part of this department‚Äîa team dubbed 'the four musketeers' by Wickham‚ÄîRowell played a key part in defining how drama would be taught as a discipline.Martin White, The Independent: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor- glynne-wickham-549424.html They developed a distinctive conception of their subject now largely accepted: of drama as a 'laboratory' subject, involving practice as well as library study, and indeed by 1951 they had their own studio space‚Äîa converted squash court.University of Bristol: http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2007/5674.html In keeping with this ethos, Brandt did some acting and directed several television, radio and film as well as stage, productions; Rowell, in collaboration with Kenneth Mobbs of Bristol Opera House, adapted and revised W. S. Gilbert's farce Engaged (1877), converting it into a Comic Opera in 1962. The department can also lay claim to a piece of theatrical history; they hosted the premiere of Harold Pinter's first play, The Room, in May 1957, performed in that former squash court of a theatre, The Drama Studio. During his time at Bristol, Rowell became a world expert on Victorian theatre, in the process building up a personal collection on the subject (now part of the University's Theatre Collection, as well as the National Archives) and being appointed as Special Lecturer in drama. He published extensively upon his specialist area, as the bibliography below attests; of particular worth to students and scholars are his collections of dramatic texts, each meticulously contextualised and introduced. As well as collections of Arthur Wing Pinero and W. S. Gilbert's works, he compiled many rare and important plays and critical articles. His seminal compendium, Nineteenth Century Plays (1953), contains ten plays spanning 1829‚Äì90, juxtaposing 'blood and thunder' barnstormers like C.H. Hazlewood's Lady Audley's Secret (1863) and Leopold Lewis' The Bells (1871) with the social satire of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Money (1840) and James Albery's Two Roses (1870). His volume of Victorian Dramatic Criticism (1971) contains a wealth of articles, essays and reviews on all aspects of nineteenth century theatre‚Äîpantomime, melodrama, Ibsen, the 1890s‚Äîincluding writings from luminaries such as William Hazlitt, Charles Lamb, William Archer, Henry James and George Bernard Shaw. Further works included a history of provincial theatres in Britain and a study of the Old Vic, London's last remaining Georgian theatre.

Geographical location Birs waterfall and power station The environmental area called the Neue Welt (new world) evolved in the 17th century as the industry started to establish itself around the upper end of the \\"St. Alban-Teich\\". This is an artificially constructed canal built during the 12th century to bring water (water power) to the industry in Basel. Later, during 1624‚Äì25, the canal was prolonged through Br√ºglingen towards the Birs waterfall in M√ºnchenstein. From here the water is diverged to the canal. Here there is a small power station that has been built onto the waterfall. The residential estate Wasserhaus lies on the left bank of the river Birs, between the industrial area of the Neue Welt and the waterfall. History Wasserhaus residential estate Up until the end of the First World War, the building of residential areas was confined to areas within the Basel city boundaries. Soon after the First World War, however, the suburban areas started being inhabited and expanded. It was during this period that large residential building blocks were erected in Basel's peripheries. These quarters were renowned for their high quality standards of residence, but also for their modest social attraction. On the other hand, experiments were made with generously arranged cooperative settlements, primarily terraced houses with individual gardens. The communal housing estate \\"Freidorf\\" in Muttenz and \\"Wasserhaus\\" in M√ºnchenstein are two prime examples of this evolution. These estates were developed to enhance the social charm in the rural community. The \\"Wasserhaus\\" residential area was built during 1920‚Äì21. The estate originated thanks to financial investments from the regional industry. In the beginning the industries themselves administrated the cooperative in the function of housing for their workers. Later the small residential cooperative progressed as an alternative to the public pension schemes. During the 1980s the private pension schemes expanded, and the small cooperative was continually losing its financial advantages. Subsequently the houses were placed on the market and the cooperative folded. Architecture Wasserhaus, the extension The estate was developed by the Architect Wilhelm Eduard Brodtbeck (1873‚Äì1957) from Liestal (canton Baselland), concluding the plans drawn by Prof. Hans Benno Bernoulli (1876‚Äì1959). Not only the funds and organisation originated from an innovative idea. The architecture was also revolutionary. Built on a vast unrestricted zone, far away from the town boundaries, the original project was foreseen for 100 residential terraced houses. These houses arranged uniformly distributed along two parallel streets in a north‚Äìsouth axis. Each house with a small garden to the street and a spacious rear garden. It was also foreseen to have a, focal and social, centrally situated congregational building as main component. However, due to financial problems, only a part of the original plans (60 houses) were completed and this without the important central connecting elements. Nevertheless, because of the unique archetype nature and the prototypical neighbourhood, the Wasserhaus estate was taken up in the inventory of the valuable and worthy of protection place of interest. Inventar der sch√ºtzenswerten Ortsbilder (ISOS) Inventar der sch√ºtzenswerten Ortsbilder (ISOS) The original project had also foreseen a large gardening area. These garden plots were later used as building space. An extension was built onto the estate during 1995‚Äì98.

Biography Qian was born in Yuyao, Shaoxing Fu (Á¥πËààÂ∫ú/ÁªçÂÖ¥Â∫ú; current Ningbo), Zhejiang Province. His original name was Kuan (ÂÆΩ), and courtesy name was Hongfu (Ê¥™Áî´). Because his recent ancestry also had the same name, to avoid the taboo, his name was changed from Kuan to Dehong. When Qian was young, he settled in Lingxu Hill (ÈúõÁ∑íÂ±±/ÁÅµÁª™Â±±; aka Lingxushan) and systematically studied the I Ching, so people also call him Mr. Xushan (Á∑íÂ±±ÂÖàÁîü/Áª™Â±±ÂÖàÁîü). In the 11th Year of Jiajing Era (ÂòâÈùñÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥; 1532), Qian joined the imperial examination together with Wang Ji, who was his classmate and also an important Confucian philosopher during his time. Qian was qualified and ranked as Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´/ËøõÂ£´). He was later matriculated as a local governmental official. Qian spent most of his life as a secretary for Wang Yangming, and a lecturer in several schools. Philosophy Qian was an early student (or disciple) of the philosopher Wang Yangming, together with his classmate Wang Ji. Qian spent most of his life studying Confucian classics and developing the philosophy of the Yangming School of Mind (ÈôΩÊòéÂøÉÂ≠∏/Èò≥ÊòéÂøÉÂ≠¶; Japanese: ÈôΩÊòéÂ≠¶; Japanese romanization: ≈åy≈çmei-gaku, ≈å stands for the surname \\"Wang\\", y≈çmei stands for \\"Yangming\\", gaku means \\"school of learning\\"). Qian collected and emended Wang's philosophical works. When Wang died, he also edited Wang's full biography.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) prisoners often face additional challenges compared to non-LGBT prisoners. According to Just Detention International, LGBT inmates are \\"among the most vulnerable in the prison population\\". 67% of LGBT prisoners in California report being assaulted while in prison. The vulnerability of LGBT prisoners has led some prisons to separate them from other prisoners, while in others they are housed with the general population. While much of the available data on LGBT inmates comes from the United States, Amnesty International maintains records of known incidents internationally in which LGBT prisoners and those perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have suffered torture, ill-treatment and violence at the hands of fellow inmates as well as prison officials. Historically, LGBT people in the United States have been socially and economically vulnerable due to their queer status. Policy, policing and the criminal justice system have historically perpetrated violence upon marginalized populations, like the queer community. This along with criminalizing same sex behaviors have created a disproportion of LGBT people in prisons. (See Sodomy laws in the United States.) Coming out Many LGBT inmates who are able, even those who are openly gay outside of prison, stay in the closet with their sexual identities while imprisoned, because inmates who are known or perceived as gay, especially lesbians and gay men with stereotypical butch or effeminate characteristics, respectively, face \\"a very high risk of sexual abuse\\". The Los Angeles County Men's jail segregates openly gay and transgender inmates, however, only if they are openly gay and if the staff that is inspecting them perceives them to be gay or trans enough for segregation. Even through attempts from gay and trans men trying to seek a safer place, the jail only segregates those that fit into their definition of gay and trans, often only accepting those they deem vulnerable enough.Masculinity as Prison: Sexual Identity, Race, and Incarceration, 99 Cal. L. Rev. 1309 (2011) Sexual assaults in prison are increasingly common: in 2011 sexual assault claims were 8,768, but 4 years later in 2015 they rose to 24,661. The data does not identify the victims nor perpetrators sexuality, but the increase in assault claims and increase in cases with evidence suggests that there is an increase in assaults against LGBT individuals. LGBT individuals are often subject to physical violence when they attempt to resist sexual abuse or sexual degradation, and can be targeted due to perceived femininity as well as if their sexual orientation is known. These individuals can be targeted because of their sexuality and attitudes towards LGBT people. In some instances, LGBT prisoners who are outed have been punished for attempting to repel an alleged aggressor, sometimes ending up in solitary confinement. Denial of access to surgical sex reassignment on the grounds of unstable or criminal behavior condemns those who are transgender. Resulting in potential continuing identity confusion, low self-esteem, drug and alcohol abuse, self-mutilation and acting out behavior. Which further facilitates the vicious cycle of chronic dysfunction, which perpetuates criminal behavior.Drawn from CANADIAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL File No. T505/2298 Transgender issues Many transgender prisoners need resources and support, and much work remains to be done. Some organizations that used to focus on women's issues have expanded to include transgender people and gender non-conforming people in their work.Sudbury, Julia. \\"Rethinking Global Justice: Black Women Resist the Transnational Prison-Industrial Complex.\\" Souls: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture, and Society 10.4 (2008) 344‚Äì360.

The papers \\"Transitioning Our Prisons Toward Affirmative Law: Examining the Impact of Gender Classification Policies on U.S. Transgender Prisoners\\" and \\"The Treatment of Transgender Prisoners, Not Just an American Problem ‚Äì A Comparative Analysis of American, Australian, and Canadian Prison Policies Concerning the Treatment of Transgender Prisoners and a 'Universal' Recommendation To Improve Treatment\\" maintain that individuals should always be addressed and placed based on their gender identity rather than their genitalia. =Australia= The bill mentioned in \\"Transgender Prisoners: A Critical Analysis of Queensland Corrective Services' New Procedure\\" has shown to be largely ineffective.Samiec, Jenny. \\"Transgender Prisoners: A Critical Analysis of Queensland Corrective Services' New Procedure.\\" Queensland Law Student Review 2.1 (2009) 32‚Äì44. Web <> =Italy= In 2010 it was reported that Italy was to open its first transgender prison at Pozzale, a decision welcomed by gay rights groups. The prison has not been created yet. = Japan = One in 13 Japanese people identify as LGBT, or about 7.6% of the population. Japan does not criminalize same-sex sexual acts, and transgender people are able change their gender through the Family Registry if certain conditions are met. However these conditions include requiring ‚Äúgender confirmation surgery, being over 20 years old, being unmarried while applying to legally change one's gender, having no minor children, and being deprived of their reproductive organ or reproductive ability‚Äù according to Amnesty International. If a person has not legally registered to change their gender before being incarcerated, they will be sent a prison that matches their gender assignment at birth. Additionally Japanese prisons are not required to provide hormone therapy for transgender inmates; since the medication isn't to treat a disease, the prisons aren't required by law to treat them. According to Amnesty International ‚ÄúJapan's Act on Penal Detention Facilities and Treatment of Inmates and Detainees (Act on Penal Detention) does not have specific clauses that cover the treatment of detainees based on sexual orientation or gender identity‚Äù. However Article 34.2 of Act on Penal Detention requires that female prison officers examine female detainees, and the practice is also extended to transgender women regardless of their status with gender confirmation surgery or not. =United States= Housing  U.S. prisons have a general policy of housing prisoners according to their sex as assigned at birth or genital configuration (i.e. post-op trans women would be placed in women's prisons), regardless of their current appearance or gender identity. Transgender women with breasts may be locked up with men, leaving them vulnerable to violence and sexual assault, as occurred with the case of Dee Farmer, a pre-operative transgender woman with breast implants, who was raped and contracted HIV when she was housed in a men's prison. Transgender men housed in women's prisons also face abuse, often more from guards than other inmates. U.S. prisons view gender and sex as binary; this includes prison dress codes, which prevent gender-nonconforming individuals from dressing to match their gender identity. There is often little gender- confirming healthcare provided. While transgender prisoners used to be permitted to be housed according to the gender with which they identify, this rule was reversed, as announced by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in May 2018. Now, housing is once again to be determined by biological sex. On November 14, 2013, Harris County, Texas adopted an LGBT inmate policy, intended to protect and assure equal treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender inmates. This allows individuals to be housed based on the gender they identify with instead of their biological sex. The policy also outlines how inmates will be searched. It includes a \\"safe zone project\\" that will endorse a \\"positive relationship of solidarity\\" connecting the sheriff's department and the gay community.Ramit Plushnick-Masti, Texas‚Äô Harris County moves to protect LGBT inmates, November 14, 2013, Albuquerque Journal Another policy states that members of the transgender community will be referred to by their chosen name, even if it has not legally been changed, both when spoken to and on their identifications bracelets. The sheriff's office in Harris County has a training and certification program for staff members to become a \\"gender classification specialist\\" and have authorization to hold discussions with inmates about gender issues.  Healthcare  Some courts in the US have ruled that hormone replacement therapy is a necessary medical treatment to which transgender prisoners are entitled. In the early 2000s, California Medical Facility, Vacaville, provided this medical treatment for male-to- female prisoners. Additionally, access to psychological counseling and to supportive underclothing like bras can help individuals live as the gender with which they self-identify. In June 2019, Layleen Polanco, a transgender woman of color, died of an epileptic seizure in solitary confinement on Rikers Island. Guards had noticed that she was unresponsive but waited 90 minutes to seek help. A year later, it was reported that 17 corrections officers would be disciplined as a result of the incident.  Demographics  In 2011, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 35% of black transgender Americans believe that they have been incarcerated simply due to perceived anti-trans bias, compared to 4% of white transgender respondents. Black transgender people had higher rates of experiences of incarceration in general (47% compared to 12% of white transgender people). It also found that black trans women were sexually assaulted in jail at a rate of 38%, compared to 12% of white trans women prisoners. = Vietnam = In 2015, the National Assembly of Vietnam passed a law which allows transgender people who have done sex reassignment surgery to register under their preferred gender. Further discussion on the treatment of LGBTQ+ people has been initiated in many later meetings of the National Assembly, in which representatives suggested that homosexual and transgender inmates be placed in different places than others. These suggestions were written into law in the 2019 Criminal Code of Vietnam, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Many attorneys and advocacy groups have praised this as a new step towards ensuring the rights of Vietnamese trans people, while others point out that the law needs amendments that clearly define what these separate areas are like. According to the new Criminal Code, beside groups like minors, foreigners, and mothers who carry their children of under 36 months into jail along with them, \\"inmates that are homosexual, transgender or people of unidentified gender can be imprisoned separately.\\" Due to the lack of coverage regarding non-binary people in Vietnam, the phrase \\"people of unidentified gender\\" is best understood as trans men or trans women who have not undergone sex reassignment surgery, while \\"transgender\\" refers to those who have. Conjugal visits A conjugal visit is a scheduled extended visit during which an inmate of a prison is permitted to spend several hours or days in private with visitors, usually family members, in special rooms, trailers or even decorated, apartment-like settings on prison grounds. While the parties may engage in sexual intercourse, in practice an inmate may have several visitors, including children, as the generally recognized basis for permitting such a visit is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to life outside prison. Laws on conjugal visits vary widely by country from a total prohibition to very permissive policies. In jurisdictions where there is some form of recognition of same-sex relationships, prisoners may be permitted conjugal visits with a same-sex partner.As of December, 2008, homosexual behaviour remains illegal in over 80 countries (see Homosexuality laws of the world). Only countries that allow same-sex conjugal visits, or where same-sex conjugal visitation rights have been addressed in law are included on this list, in addition to a sub-list of countries that do not allow conjugal visitation for any inmates at all. In the United States, conjugal visits are allowed only in four states: California, Connecticut, New York and Washington. =Same-sex conjugal visitation by country= ;Argentina :Opposite-sex conjugal visits have long been permitted, but a case in the central province of C√≥rdoba has authorized same-sex conjugal visits as well. The ruling came after an inmate was twice punished with solitary confinement for having sex with his visiting partner in his cell. The inmate brought a lawsuit on the basis of a law that obliges authorities to \\"guarantee (the availability of) intimate relations for prisoners with their spouses or, alternatively, with their (partners).\\" ;Australia :In Australia, conjugal visits are only permitted in the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. This includes visits by partners of the same-sex, provided they are not also incarcerated. Conjugal visits of any type are not allowed in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. ;Belgium :Both men and women are entitled to conjugal visitation as heterosexual couples. Belgium's prisons provide facilities where inmates can meet their spouses once a month for a maximum of two uninterrupted hours. There are however circumstances, as they apply to heterosexual couples as well, where these conjugal visits can be revoked. ;Brazil :In February 2015 inmates who register their same sex partner have the right to conjugal visitations in all of Brazil's jails. This decision was reached by the National Criminal and Penitentiary Council. The conjugal visit must be guaranteed at least once a month and cannot be prohibited or suspended as a disciplinary measure with the exception of certain cases where violations being restricted are linked to the improper use of conjugal visitations. ;Canada :All inmates, with the exception of those on disciplinary restrictions or at risk for family violence, are permitted \\"Private Family Visits\\" of up to 72 hours' duration once every two months. Eligible visitors, who may not themselves be prison inmates, are: spouse, or common-law partner of at least six months; children; parents; foster parents; siblings; grandparents; and \\"persons with whom, in the opinion of the institutional head, the inmate has a close familial bond.\\" Food is provided by the institution but paid by the inmates and visitors, who are also responsible for cleaning the unit after the visit. During a visit, staff members have regular contact with the inmate and visitors. ;Caribbean region :Conjugal visits are not permitted in the Caribbean. Marcus Day, adviser to the Association of Caribbean Heads of Corrections and Prison Services has urged the implementation of opposite-sex conjugal visitation for male inmates and the provision of condoms within prisons in an effort to stop the spread of HIV. Day attributes the spread of HIV/AIDS in prisons to \\"homosexual relationships among otherwise heterosexual men and homosexual rape,\\" situations he said are rife in Caribbean prisons:\\"Allow men to have the women come and visit them in prison and have a private room where they can make love to each other and the desire to have same-sex relationships will be greatly reduced,\\" claimed Day. ;Colombia :On October 11, 2001, the Colombian Supreme Court issued a verdict in favour of the right to same-sex conjugal visits in a case brought by Alba Nelly Montoya, a lesbian in the Risaralda Women's Prison. This was not the first case regarding same-sex conjugal visitation in the country. Marta Alvarez, another lesbian inmate, had been campaigning since 1994 for the same right, and on October 1, 1999 her case became the first ever sexual orientation-related case presented before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In her petition, Alvarez had argued that her rights to personal dignity, integrity, and equality were being infringed upon by the denial to allow her conjugal visits in prison, since the Colombian National Penitentiary and Prison Institute (INPEC) granted conjugal visitation rights in a discriminatory fashion to heterosexual men and women (the latter restricted to visits from husbands only), and denied this right to same-sex couples. :While the Colombian government admitted its failure to grant conjugal visitation to Alvarez constituted \\"inhuman and discriminatory\\" treatment, it continued to deny such visits, arguing reasons of security, discipline, and morality. Alvarez was also subjected to retaliatory disciplinary measures, including being transferred to a men's prison, which ceased following a domestic and international protest campaign. ;Costa Rica :In August 2008, the Costa Rican Constitutional Tribunal rejected a man's appeal in a lawsuit against prison authorities who stopped his conjugal visits to his male partner, a current inmate, ruling that gay inmates do not have the right to conjugal visits. The court recently rejected this ruling and now allows same-sex conjugal visits. ;Israel :Gay prisoners in Israeli Prison System (IPS) are allowed conjugal visits with their partners under the same circumstances as heterosexual prisoners. This policy was revised in July 2013 under Association for Civil Rights in Israel chief legal attorney Dan Yakir challenged the lack of conjugal visits for same sex inmates since 2009. ;Mexico :In July 2007 through the efforts of the country's National Human Rights Commission (CDHDF), the Mexico City prison system began allowing same-sex conjugal visits on the basis of a 2003 law which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation. The visitor is not required to be married to the inmate. This policy change applies to all Mexico City Prisons. ;Russia :Same-sex long or official visits are prohibited, but short visits for friends can be organised if one is imprisoned in a so-called kolonija-poselenie. Official sex in prison is possible only during the 1‚Äì3 day long visit of a registered heterosexual spouse. ;United Kingdom :Conjugal visits are not allowed to any prisoner regardless of sexual orientation, but home visits are. ;United States :In June 2007, the California Department of Corrections announced it would allow same- sex conjugal visits. The policy was enacted to comply with a 2005 state law requiring state agencies to give the same rights to domestic partners that heterosexual couples receive. The new rules allow for visits only by registered married same sex couples or domestic partners who are not themselves incarcerated. Further, the same sex marriage or domestic partnership must have been established before the prisoner was incarcerated.\\"Calif. gay inmates get conjugal visits.\\" Associated Press at NBC News. Saturday June 2, 2007. Retrieved on December 30, 2009. In April 2011, New York adopted to allow conjugal visits for currently married, or civil- union spouses same-sex partners.  Health care among LGBT Prisoners by country  According to Masen Davis, Executive Director of the Transgender Law Center, LGBT people in prisons often face barriers in seeking basic and necessary medical treatment, exacerbated by the fact that prison health care staff are often not aware of or trained on how to address those needs. = United States = In May 2006, two transgender prisoners filed suit in January 2008 challenging a Wisconsin law that bars inmates from receiving hormones or sex reassignment surgery notwithstanding Principle 9 of The Yogyakarta Principles. The significance of the Yogyakarta Principles is also stressed by \\"Handbook on Prisoners with Special Needs\\" published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. As far as constitutional law is concerned, in result of Farmer vs. Brennan (1994), in accordance with the Eighth Amendment, prison officials cannot deliberately be indifferent towards blatant abuse directed against transgender prisoners. The protection of prisoners in the Eighth Amendment also extends to medical health care (i.e. hormone treatment and gender reassignment surgery). Of the transgender inmates serving in Federal or State prison, 75%-90% desire gender reassignment surgery and 85% desire hormone therapy. This \\" treatment is critical to maintain the health and safety of inmates, as without it, transgender prisoners may fall into deeper depression and have greater risk of life-threatening autocastration\\". Solitary confinement is a potential punishment for those in prison, and it has known effects on prisoner health and mental health. LGBT prisoners face similar risks as the general population, and especially in the case of transgender individuals may be placed into solitary for their own protection. The state however does not provide treatment for declining mental health, and prisoners in solitary have a hard time getting their medications. For transgender individuals this can mean missing hormone treatments and other necessary medical care. Many prisons deny health care to transgender inmates, relying on binary medical services in gender-separated prisons. Furthermore, many are denied psychological treatment for Gender Dysphoria: distressed caused by a mismatch of gender hormones and physical genitalia. = Canada = On August 31, 2001, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal concluded that Sections 30 and 31 of the Correctional Service of Canada contained discrimination on the basis of sex and disability in Canadian Human Rights Act. After Synthia Kavanagh, a trans woman sentenced for life in 1989 for 2nd-degree murder, was sent to an institution for males. This institution assignment occurred despite the trial judge's recommendation that Synthia, as a trans woman, serve her sentence in a facility for women. Further, Synthia was denied sex reassignment surgery and hormones. The institutional policy, at the time, only facilitated cases which addressed conditions in which, reasonably, the plaintiff would seek sexual reassignment after the period of incarceration. Due to Synthia Kavanagh's life sentence, this was not a foreseeable option. \\"The decision to discontinue hormones in 1990 seems to have been based on the complainant's life sentence which made her, according to Dr. R. Dickey, apparently ineligible for ultimate reassignment. ... the diagnosis of transsexualism has been clearly established in this case\\" by expert witness testimony, throughout her trial, \\"She [had] responded well to feminizing effects of cross-gender hormones and has experienced no significant side effects. As established by legal precedent and confirmed by policy in Canadian and British Columbia Corrections Service, the complainant was entitled to continue her hormone treatment\\". In Petitioning the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, Kavanagh argued that \\"The Correctional Service of Canada has discriminated and continues to discriminate against me because of my disability and sex (Transsexualism), contrary to Section 5 of the Canadian Human Right Act, by refusing to provide me with necessary medical and surgical treatment.\\" Kavanagh continues to elaborate on her transition prior to imprisonment in this address, stating \\"since 1981 I have been diagnosed as a transsexual, which means that my gender is female but my sex is male. For 13 years, I was on estrogen hormonal treatment and lived as a woman, in preparation for my sex reassignment surgery to correct my medical disorder. In May 1990, my hormonal treatment was discontinued.\\" After incarceration in a men's facility Kavanagh \\"repeatedly asked the CSC to arrange for evaluation for sex reassignment surgery, for the surgery to be performed and my consequent transfer to a women's institution.\\" The discontinuation of hormone treatment and rejection of proposed sex reassignment surgery, paired with the continuation of periods of solitude prompted Kavanagh to respond \\"I believe that the CSC Policy discriminates against transsexuals, as the policy does not recognize the need for the continuation of medical treatment at the onset of incarceration, nor does the policy acknowledge the psychological need to be imprisoned with other members of one's psychological sex at the time of incarceration.\\"Human Rights Commission Complaint Form W 08861 The issue of surgical reassignment has worrying implications for incarcerated transgender people. Individuals serving life sentences or other periods of prolonged incarceration may be less able to \\"prove\\" that they live socially as their gender; because this is a requirement to qualify for surgical reassignment, it constitutes a serious institutional barrier for transsexual people attempting to access gender-affirming care. = Russia = Homosexuality is no longer criminalized in Russia, but ‚Äúnew laws have restricted LGBT and human rights organizations, limited LGBT content on the Internet, and restricted international funding for all non-governmental organizations, including AIDS Service organizations and LGBT groups.‚Äù HIV was the first and third leading causes of premature disability and mortality in Russia, and was initially concentrated among injecting drug users and their sex partners, and recently the transmission is being reported among men who have sex with men or MSM. ‚ÄúRecent studies have identified significant risks for HIV and prevalence estimates of 5.5‚Äì6.0% among MSM in St. Petersburg and Moscow.‚Äù Russia requires reporting of HIV positive diagnosis, which many immigrants avoid participating in as it could prevent them from entering the country, or they could be detained and expelled from the country as well. Homosexuality or the advocacy of LGBT rights in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan is criminalized, which causes many LGBT people to migrate to Moscow. As a result, fear of testing HIV positive and being expelled from Russia to return to their countries of citizenship where they could in turn have their sexual behavior criminalized, prevents many immigrants in Russia from accessing the health care and treatment they need. = Hungary = Hungary has compulsory HIV testing, which is part of the Ministry of Health regulations, which requires prostitutes, homosexuals, and prisoners be tested for HIV. When prisoners are found to be HIV positive they are taken to a special unit in Budapest. Units for HIV positive prisoners are staffed with individuals who are trained and who understand the problems of HIV. Specialized treatment of HIV are only available at one hospital in Budapest. HIV treatment for prisoners is paid for by the NHS. These prisoners have their own cells with their own showers, a community room with games, and a social worker available to them. Post test counseling is also provided. LGBT youth prisoners in the United States According to some studies, LGBT youth are particularly at risk for arrest and detention. Jody Marksamer, Shannan Wilber, and Katayoon Majd, writing on behalf of the Equity Project, a collaboration between Legal Services for Children, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the National Juvenile Defender Center, say that LGBT youth are over represented in the populations of youth who are at risk of arrest and of those who are confined in juvenile justice facilities in the United States. Many LGBT youth often experience being cast aside from their families and hostile environments while at school. The school system fails many LGBT students through their zero-tolerance policy which is meant to protect them but often results in LGBT students being arrested or given harsh disciplinary action. According to \\"Messy, Butch, and Queer: LGBTQ Youth and the School-to-Prison Pipeline\\", LGBT youth are often blamed for the harassment they receive despite the fact that they are being targeted solely upon their sexual orientation or the way the LGBT students present themselves.Snapp, Shannon D, Jennifer M Hoenig, Amanda Fields, and Stephen T Russell. \\"Messy, Butch, and Queer: LGBTQ Youth and the School-to- Prison Pipeline.\\" Journal of Adolescent Research 30.1 (2015): 57-82. Web. Queer youth are also socially and economically vulnerable, especially in regards to high rates of homelessness. This vulnerability can lead to illegal behavior, and also over policing when homeless, creating an over representation of LGBT youth in prisons. See Homelessness among LGBT youth in the United States, and LGBT youth vulnerability. A brief by the Center for American Progress found that each year approximately 300,000 gay, trans, and gender nonconforming youth are arrested or detained each year, 60% of whom are Black or Hispanic. These queer youth make up 13‚Äì15 percent of the juvenile incarceration system, compared to their overall population of 5‚Äì7 percent. Similar to how transgender adults are often placed into solitary confinement, allegedly for their own protection, these youth are \\"protected\\" in the same way. Often, however, it is because they are seen as sexual predators rather than potential victims. Courts also commonly assign queer youth to sex offender treatment programs even when convicted of a non-sexual crime. \\"As 12% of adjudicated youth in juvenile facilities reported experiencing sexual abuse in 2009‚Äù according to a report from the Juvenile Law Center. Physical and sexual abuse According to Amnesty International, globally, LGBT prisoners and those perceived to be LGBT, are at risk of torture, ill-treatment and violence from other inmates as well as prison officials. Amnesty International cites numerous cases internationally where LGBT inmates are known to have been abused or murdered by prison officials or fellow inmates. Statistics show that 59% of transgender women in male prisons had been sexually assaulted while incarcerated compared to the 4% of the male-identified population. Transgender women in male prisons also deal with the risk of forced prostitution by both prison staff and other prisoners. Forced prostitution can occur when a correction officer brings a transgender woman to the cell of a male inmate and locks them in so that the male inmate can rape her. The male inmate will then pay the correction officer in some way and sometimes the correction officer will give the woman a portion of the payment. \\"[P]risoners fitting any part of the following description are more likely to be targeted: young, small in size, physically weak, gay, first offender, possessing \\"feminine\\" characteristics such as long hair or a high voice; being unassertive, unaggressive, shy, intellectual, not street-smart, or \\"passive\\"; or having been convicted of a sexual offense against a minor. Prisoners with any one of these characteristics typically face an increased risk of sexual abuse, while prisoners with several overlapping characteristics are much more likely than other prisoners to be targeted for abuse.\\"Joanne Mariner, No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons = In the United States = Gay and bisexual men are often assumed to be responsible for the preponderance of sexual assaults perpetrated in prisons as has been reflected in various American judicial decisions. For example, in Cole v. Flick758 F. 2d 124 (3d Cir. 1985). According to trial documents, four expert witnesses, all of them prison wardens, testified to the legitimacy of this concern, stating their belief that \\"a correlation exists between security problems resulting from prison homosexuality and long hair, and that predatory homosexuals are more likely to attack or become involved in a fight over a long-haired inmate than a short-haired one.\\" the court upheld the right of prisons to limit the length of inmates' hair, claiming that allowing them to wear long hair could lead to an increase in attacks by \\"predatory homosexuals\\". In Roland v. Johnson,1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 11468 (6th Cir. 1991) the court described \\"gangs of homosexual predators\\". And Ashann-Ra v. Virginia112 F. Supp. 2d 559, 563 (W.D. Va. 2000) contains references to \\"inmates known to be predatory homosexuals [stalking] other inmates in the showers\\". According to a study by Human Rights Watch, however, \\"The myth of the 'homosexual predator' is groundless. Perpetrators of rape typically view themselves as heterosexual and, outside of the prison environment, prefer to engage in heterosexual activity. Although gay inmates are much more likely than other inmates to be victimized in prison, they are not likely to be perpetrators of sexual abuse.\\" (see also situational homosexuality) A related problem is that there is a tendency, among both prison officials and prisoners, to view victimization as proof of homosexuality: \\"The fact of submitting to rape‚Äîeven violent, forcible rape‚Äîredefines [a prisoner] as 'a punk, sissy, queer.'\\" Officials sometimes take the view all sex involving a gay prisoner is necessarily consensual, meaning that victims known or perceived to be gay may not receive necessary medical treatment, protection, and legal recourse, and perpetrators may go unpunished and remain able to perpetrate abuse on their victims: According to Andrea Cavanaugh Kern, a spokesperson for Stop Prisoner Rape, the combination of high rates of sexual assault against gay prisoners and high rates of HIV infection in the prison population is \\"a life-or-death issue for the LGBT community\\". While much of the data regards male prisoners, according to Amnesty International, \\"perceived or actual sexual orientation has been found to be one of four categories that make a female prisoner a more likely target for sexual abuse\\". It wasn't until 2003 that PREA (Prison Rape Elimination Act) was enacted by United States Congress to aid in the prevention of sexual abuse and misconduct. = Colombia = In 2019, la Defensor√≠a del Pueblo identified 285 cases of violence and discrimination against LGBTI prisoners. Over a third of these victims were transgender. One-eighth were Venezuelan. Segregation For their own safety, LGBT people in prison are sometimes placed in administrative segregation or protective custody. Although homosexuality is \\"generally regarded as a factor supporting an inmate's claim to protective custody\\", homophobia among prison officials and a misperception among many guards that \\"when a gay inmate has sex with another man it is somehow by definition consensual\\" mean that access to such custody is not always easy or available. Another problem is that protective and disciplinary custody are often the same, which means that prisoners in \\"protective housing\\" are often held with the most violent inmates in highly restrictive and isolated settings‚Äîsometimes in more or less permanent lockdown or solitary confinement‚Äîthat prevent them from participating in drug treatment, education and job-training programs, from having contact with other prisoners or outside visitors, or from enjoying privileges such as the right to watch television, listen to the radio, or even to leave their cells. The degree of safety that protective custody provides depends on the facilities. Protective custody can provide a secure environment that is free from violence by other prisoners or it can isolate prisoners, and position them with a higher risk of violence by a correctional officer. Although the protective custody can offer some level of protection, the harmful physical and psychological impacts of isolation show that it is an unwanted alternative to assignment in the general population. In other cases, institutions may have special areas (known by such nicknames as the \\"queerentine\\", \\"gay tank\\", \\"queen tank\\", or \\"softie tank\\") for housing vulnerable inmates such as LGBT people, elderly or disabled prisoners, or informers. = LGBT Prison Segregation in the United States = In San Francisco, for example, transgender inmates are automatically segregated from other prisoners. Nevertheless, according to Eileen Hirst, San Francisco Sheriff's Chief of Staff, being gay is not in itself enough to justify a request for protective housing: inmates requesting such housing must demonstrate that they are vulnerable. For financial or other reasons segregated housing is not always available. For instance at Rikers Island, New York City's largest jail, the segregated unit for LGBT prisoners, known as \\"gay housing\\", was closed in December 2005 citing a need to improve security. The unit had opened in the 1970s due to concerns about abuse of LGBT prisoners in pretrial detention. The New York City Department of Corrections' widely criticised plan was to restructure the classification of prisoners and create a new protective custody system which would include 23-hour-per-day lockdown (identical to that mandated for disciplinary reasons) or moving vulnerable inmates to other facilities. Whereas formerly all that was required was a declaration of homosexuality or the appearance of being transgender, inmates wanting protective custody would now be required to request it in a special hearing. Solitary confinement Solitary confinement has become the prison system's preferred method to protect transgender inmates from other prisoners in cases involving sexual assault, harassment and physical violence. Advocates for transgender prisoners argue that this method only increases the harassment they receive from officers and various other staff members as reported by Injustice at Every Turn. = Solitary Confinement in the United States = In the report, 44% of transgender male respondents and 40% of transgender women respondents who were imprisoned reported being harassed by officers and/or other staff members of the prison system. While in solitary confinement, transgender individuals are less likely to receive medical care. Out of the respondents in the same report 12% of transgender individuals surveyed reported being denied routine non-transition related healthcare and 17% reported being denied hormone treatment. The number was disproportionately higher when transgender people of color reported lack of transition health care and hormone treatment with American Indians reporting 36% denial and Black and/or African American reporting a 30% denial rate. The use of solitary confinement also lessens transgender inmate's access to programs and work assignments where they may be able to lessen their sentences, enter rehabilitation programs, or earn money to buy basic products such as soap and also lessens their chances to obtain parole or conditional release. Solitary confinement has also shown to affect the mental health of transgender prisoners. With the report of filed by Injustice at Every Turn, 41% of respondents reported attempted suicide. With transgender people of color, 56% of American Indian and 54% of multiracial individuals reported attempted suicide. The report also links the over-use of solitary confinement as a factor in the high rate of suicide attempts by transgender people of color within the prison system. In addition to the conditions themselves amounting to torture, solitary confinement usually restricts a person‚Äôs access to education, work, and program opportunities. While mental health is a key priority and emphasis for inmates subjected to solitary confinement, there are other discriminatory disadvantages that come with it as well. For example, education and work programs are often essential prerequisites to achieving good time and parole. This means that many LGBT people, who are more likely to be placed in solitary confinement, are also less likely to be paroled or released early, forcing them to serve out their maximum sentences. Activists argue that members of the LGBT community should have equal access to prison programs and services, a right protected and provided for under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. According to Title IX of the Education Amendments, discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal. Many education programs in prisons, jails, and juvenile detention centers are funded by the Federal government and those who take funding from the government must adhere to the full tenets of these amendments. Title IX extends to protect inmates who are denied access to prison programs and resources because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. The Fourteenth Amendment asserts that all inmates should have equal access to libraries, educational programs, the internet, and corresponding resources. = Solitary Confinement in Canada = In cases where the incarcerated are assigned to prisons based on sex, rather than their gender-identity, complete segregation is often seen as the only viable way for ensuring safety. In the case of Synthia Kavanagh, she was assigned to a male institution despite explicit recommendations from the trial judge. As a result, Kavanagh was \\"placed in segregation over extended periods of her incarceration for the purpose of protection from self-harm or abuse by others. Segregation for prolonged periods is not only inhuman but [is additionally] unconducive to any prospect of stabilization or rehabilitation.\\" Support for LGBT people in prison As a result of the rise of awareness of LGBT persons in prisons, many organizations have developed specifically to support LGBT people in the prison system. These organizations address the various needs surrounding specific issues that LGBT persons in the prison system face. Some organizations also support family members of LGBTQ inmates. Black and Pink is an American organization that is composed of \\"LGBTQ prisoners and 'free world' allies\\" who focus on prison abolishment movement and support LGBTQ prison inmates and their families. The organization offers various services such as court accompaniment, a pen pal program, workshops and training, and support for LGBTQ persons who are experiencing sexual violence, harassment, or lack of health care. LGBT Books to Prisoners is donation- funded, volunteer-run, non-profit support group based in Madison, WI. It sends books and other educational materials, free of charge, to incarcerated LGBT people across the United States. Since its founding in 2008, the organization has sent materials to almost 9,000 people. The Prison Activists Resource Center also provides information for organizations that are dedicated solely for LGBT Prisoners, such as Hearts on a Wire which is a Pennsylvania based organization focused on helping Transgender individuals. Other listed resources include GLBTQ Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and LGBT Books to Prisoners. These sources either provide links for possible legal assistance, or provide materials in an attempt to make the prison experience more bearable.

One of the main reasons these ranges exist is to avoid accidentally using real phone numbers in movies and television programmes because of viewers frequently calling the numbers used. In North America, the area served by the North American Numbering Plan (NANPA) system of area codes, fictitious telephone numbers are usually of the form (XXX) 555-xxxx. The use of 555 numbers in fiction, however, led a desire to assign some of them in the real world, and some of them are no longer suitable for use in fiction. Other areas have different fictitious telephone numbers. To be effective, it must not be possible to change a fictitious telephone number into a real one by adding or changing a few digits. Usually, the number must be unassigned in every area code within the numbering plan. Outside NANPA, special fictitious telephone numbers for mobile phones, premium-rate numbers or toll free numbers are sometimes assigned as well. Telephone numbers in movies, television and music In the I Love Lucy episode \\"The Girls Want to Go to a Nightclub\\" (1951), Lucy dials up Sam Zabaglione, at Plaza 52099 (755-2099). In 1966 Wilson Pickett recorded \\"634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)\\", which also appears in the soundtrack of the movie Blues Brothers 2000. It has been covered by multiple artists including Tina Turner and Ry Cooder. Tommy Tutone's hit 1982 song \\"867-5309/Jenny\\" identifies a working number in many area codes which continue to receive large numbers of calls asking for \\"Jenny\\" decades later. In the 1992 film Sneakers the NSA agent Mary gives her telephone number as (415) 273-9164. In 1992, filmmaker Michael Moore unwittingly included footage of himself reciting his telephone number in the documentary Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint. He received 314 phone calls in just the first day following its broadcast on PBS.Schultz, Emily (2006). Michael Moore: A Biography, ECW Press, p. 96. The all-girl singing group The Marvelettes had an early Motown hit record in 1962 with \\"Beechwood 4-5789\\", written by Marvin Gaye, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson and George Gordy. The song became a hit again two decades later when it was covered by The Carpenters in 1982. The makers of 2003 film Bruce Almighty used 776-2323 as a telephone number for God (played by Morgan Freeman). This number remains unassigned in 1-716 Buffalo (where the film is set). 776 is not a fictitious exchange in other area codes, where subscribers with the matching number were inundated with callers asking for \\"God\\". In Colorado the calls were misdirected to KDMN radio; in Sanford, North Carolina the number belongs to a church. 776-2323 was ultimately replaced with a 555 number for television airings of the movie and on most copies of the DVD. \\"777-9311\\" by The Time used Dez Dickerson's actual telephone number at the time the song was written, causing his phone to ring incessantly until he had his number changed. In 2014, Russian snowboarder Alexey Sobolev received over two thousand text messages within a few days after printing mobile phone number +7-9250222285 on a helmet worn during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In Germany, the 1981 Spider Murphy Gang song \\"Skandal im Sperrbezirk\\" (\\"Scandal in the Blocked Zone\\") contains a telephone number, zweiunddrei√üig, sechzehn, acht: 32 16 8. The number is that of a Munich prostitute who operates in the \\"blocked zone\\", the area of the city center where street prostitutes were forbidden. The band checked that the phone number was not assigned in Munich, but it was assigned in some other cities. The song was a hit, topping the charts in Germany for 36 weeks; it was #1 in Austria (16 weeks) and Switzerland (11 weeks) as well. It has become an Oktoberfest staple. Singer G√ºnther Sigl said in an interview that the song became \\"at one time, the most famous phone number in Germany.\\" He added: \\"As an apology, we paid for some number changes and sent numerous bouquets.\\" In 2004, the episode \\"My Malpractical Decision\\" of Scrubs gave the character Dr. Turk's phone number as (916) CALL-TUR[K], i.e. 916-225-5887, with an extraneous 5 at the end to make Turk's full name. (J.D. comments, \\"I'll always dial the 'K' for you.\\") This was for a time an active cell phone number, which would play a message urging fans to keep watching the show and to vote for it at the People's Choice Awards.

Two digit area codes which consist of digits between 2 and 9 are geographic areas, while area codes ending with a 0 or a 1 denote other services. The area code 55, which, according to its first digit, would be normally assigned to a geographic area in Eastern Hungary, is reserved as a test code with no subscriber numbers assigned. There are certain closed networks redefining area code 55 and assigning such numbers for subscribers or machines inside the network, but these are non-standard and non-dialable from outside the network. Telephone numbers starting with the digits 555 are assigned to subscribers as ordinary numbers. Hungarian taxi company Tele5 Taxi uses 555-5555 as a vanity number, while at least one company specializing in vanity numbers sells cell phone numbers starting with the digits 555 for a premium rate, capitalizing on their fame in American movies. =Republic of Ireland= Phone numbers of the format 020-91X-XXXX are reserved by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) for filming and drama use.http://www.comreg.ie/_fileupload/publications/ComReg0804.pdf =North American Numbering Plan= The exchange prefix 555 in the North American Numbering Plan is reserved for Directory Assistance and information numbers. As these are not issued as standard business or residence lines, the use of a 555 number in fiction is almost universal. Only the 555-01xx range is officially reserved, though numbers outside this range are commonly used. The reservation applies to all geographic North American Numbering Plan area codes. 555 or a variant remains potentially valid outside North America; New Zealand uses mobile *555 to report traffic collisions. In North America, exchanges 958 and 959 are normally reserved for local and long-distance test numbers (such as automatic number announcement circuits). A rare few areas (such as area code 204 in Manitoba) reserve 959 only. 950-xxxx are reserved as local access numbers for feature group \\"B\\" alternate long-distance carriers. Local or adjacent domestic area codes are mostly avoided as exchange prefixes (so +1-212-718-1234 in New York City could only be fictional). These are not as well known and do not often appear in fiction. These reservations do not apply outside North America. Early Bell System publications which needed to illustrate a telephone with a number displayed on it commonly used 311-555-2368, and for multi-button phones, -2369, -2370, -2371, etc. This number appeared in Bell advertisements as recently as 1978. These numbers were also common in films and television; Jim Rockford's phone number in the United States detective television series The Rockford Files was 311-555-2368, as was one of Jaime Sommers' private numbers in The Bionic Woman; as a seven-digit call, 555-2368 reaches Ghostbusters.Commercial advertisement (video) for Ghostbusters at www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtyNeMazZY8 The number (if dialed as a ten-digit local call in large cities) now reaches 3-1-1 (city hall), but it occasionally continues to appear in documentation as a fictional number. In much of the North American Numbering Plan, a 0 or 1 in the second digit signified an area code until 1994; these numbers could not be issued as individual local exchanges without breaking eight-digit (1+7D) long-distance calls within an area code. The B-52's (album) used the non-working number 6060-842 as the title of a 45 rpm \\"B\\"-side track on the 1979 version of hit single \\"Rock Lobster\\"; the song's main character dials \\"(the) stupid number all day long\\" only to find it disconnected. This reservation no longer exists.For instance, +1-844-606-0842 breaks both the rule that area codes must have a \\"0\\" or \\"1\\" middle digit and the requirement that the seven-digit local portion be formatted as NNX-XXXX. The number is valid now, but not in 1979. Universal Pictures acquired the phone number (212) 664-7665 for use in films to avoid the 555 prefix. It has been used in the films Munich, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, The Adjustment Bureau, and Definitely, Maybe. Fictional Telecom has reserved voice over IP numbers in the 206 (Seattle), 323 (Los Angeles), 415 (San Francisco), and 646 (New York) area codes for use in films, TV and radio dramas. Occasionally, a real number serves as an Easter egg, as the publisher directs a number they own to a promotional message, a contest line or other content which ties into the original programme. Phone numbers whose exchanges begin with 1 are also occasionally used as fictional numbers. Under the North American Numbering Plan, all telephone exchanges run from 200 to 999 with similar restrictions on telephone area codes. Like the reservation on area codes with \\"9\\" as the middle area code digit, the restrictions on \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" are intended to facilitate a possible future expansion which would lengthen all North American numbers by one or more digits. =United Kingdom= The Office of Communications (Ofcom) has reserved blocks of numbers in most major areas for use in TV and radio dramas. Fictitious numbers in (011x) and (01x1) area codes mostly end with the digits 496 0xxx, however Tyneside uses (0191) 498 0xxx. London uses 020 7946 0xxx; Cardiff uses 029 2018 0xxx; and Belfast uses 028 9018 0xxx. The generic (and currently unused) area code 01632 is available for all other purposes. Ofcom also reserves blocks of mobile phone (07700 900xxx), freephone (0808 157 0xxx), and premium rate (0909 879 0xxx) numbers for drama use. They also recently added a UK-wide range to the list (0306 999 0xxx). =Sweden= The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) handles the Swedish telephone numbering plan. PTS has decided to reserve a number of number series for use in, for example, films, TV series or books . =France= French phone numbering plans are established by the Autorit√© de R√©gulation des Communications √âlectroniques et des Postes (ARCEP).

The film is an adaptation of a book by Clarice Lispector with the same name. In 1986, the actress Marc√©lia Cartaxo won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, for her role as Macabea. It was selected as the Brazilian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \\"Macabea is an example of the mental underdevelopment of the poor people of the world\\", the director, Amaral, has written. \\"Facing the solitude of the big city, she possesses the emptiness of someone who does not have the means to be cultured.\\" But surely her case is even more extreme than that. Macabea doesn't even possess the culture of poverty; she is simply an emptiness. The film is reviewed in Pauline Kael's ninth collection of movie reviews, Hooked, where she praises it, and particularly the performance of Marcelia Cartaxo. The film gets to you, \\" and the image of Marcelia Cartaxo's Macabea is what does it - the terrible aloneness of this mass woman, this nothing of a woman whom you wouldn't notice on the street. Umberto D stood for all the proud, angry old people who couldn't live on their pensions, but he was himself too - his own ornery old man. Macabea is most herself in her moments of contentment: she smiles serenely as she celebrates her Sunday by taking a ride in the subway. It's the director's triumph that this girl gets away from her. Numbed as she is, she's as alive as Amaral or you or I, and more mysteriously so.\\" Plot Macabea is an impoverished 19 year old orphan girl, possibly mildly retarded, who recently moved to Rio de Janeiro after her aunt, who raised her, passed away. She works as a typist and shares a room with three other women. Though she works for less than minimum wage, she seems unaware of her impoverishment. She is described as unattractive by coworkers and makes many mistakes at work since she slowly types one key at a time. She seems unaware of the right way to behave in society. Instead of visiting the bathroom at night, she urinates into a bowl she hides under her bed. Instead of using a tissue, she wipes her nose on her sleeve. Her typed pages often have holes and grease on them but she is unaware of this until her boss points it out. However, she is extremely polite and quick to apologize when she makes a mistake. Macabea grew up in extreme poverty without education, and was never taught anything about social graces. Macabea's personality is a blank slate. She describes herself as a typist and a virgin who likes Coca-Cola. \\"I'm not much of a person,\\" she says. She spends her time listening to the radio and copying other women. Her lack of experience allows her to derive pleasure from little things in life. On Sundays, she gets great pleasure from riding the subway. When she hears a song on the radio, its beauty moves her to tears. She pastes magazine photos on the walls and listens to others for cues on how to behave. It's unclear what Macabea really wants other than to be like everyone else. She obtains what little knowledge she has from the radio. Eventually she meets Olimpico, an insecure steelworker from Paraiba with a massive chip on his shoulder who dreams of being rich one day. He is also uncultured and uneducated but behaves as though he knows everything. Olimpico's dream is to be a congressman because they have cars, indoor plumbing, and money to give away. He proudly shows Macabea his gold tooth and says that one day he will have a mouth of gold teeth which will show the world his wealth. They begin dating which mainly consists of their sitting on a park bench while Olimpico brags about his bright future. He often gets annoyed with Macabea because her naivete prevents her from being impressed with the things he tells her. He is extremely defensive about his lack of education and quick to anger when Macabea questions him telling her that whorehouses are full of girls who asked too much. He seems to be considering her as a wife because of her innocence. Macabea spends most of her time with Olimpico repeating things she's heard on the radio. Olimpico is often rude to Macabea but she seems not to realize it. When they are caught in a rainstorm, he uses his handkerchief to dry off while she's left shivering. Their first date Olimpico offers to buy her a cup of coffee but tells her that if she wants milk in it, she must pay for it. When she tries to sing a song she likes, he knocks her onto the ground. Macabea gives him a coin and begs him to call her at work so she can get a call just once. He never does. Macabea's coworker Gloria often gives her advice about men. Gloria dates a different man every week and dresses in sexy clothes. Macabea views her as a big sister or role model. Gloria is so desperate to get married she goes to a macumbeira. The manipulative woman advises her to steal a friend's man as penance for her unclean soul and then she'll meet her dream man. Gloria winds up having an affair with Olimpico. He eventually leaves Macabea telling her she's a hair in his soup that's disgusting. Gloria winds up meeting the man of her dreams and leaving Olimpico. He waits outside Macabea's house with a giant stuffed animal meant for GLoria. When Macabea goes to the fortune teller, Madame Carlota accurately predicts Macabea's past. Eventually, she tells her she will marry a rich foreigner in a Mercedes who will give her much money. Excited and looking forward to the future for the first time, Macabea buys a new dress and runs out into the street without looking. She is hit by a foreigner in a Mercedes. As she lies bleeding on the street, she imagines the driver running toward her with open arms.

The center of his cult is situated at the mountain sanctuary known as the Santuario di San Magno, in the Valle Grana, Castelmagno, in the province of Cuneo. His feast day is August 19. Legend Local tradition makes him a soldier of the Theban Legion, which had been commanded by Saint Maurice. The Legion, is supposed to have been decimated at Agaunum in 286 AD, but Magnus fled to the mountains of Piedmont, preaching the Christian religion in the Alps. He was eventually martyred and buried in the spot now occupied by the Santuario di San Magno. The church, however, may have occupied a spot once dedicated to the Roman god Mars. The current church was built between 1704 and 1716, in Piedmontese Baroque style, though its interior still preserves frescoes of the 15th and 16th centuries. Santuario di San Magno As Damiano Pomi points out, neither documentary nor archaeological evidence supports the connection between Magnus and the Theban Legion. Similar to the cults of Saint Chiaffredo at Crissolo, Saint Bessus at Val Soana, Saint Tegulus at Ivrea, Saint Constantius at Villar San Costanzo, and Saint Dalmatius at Borgo San Dalmazzo, the cult of Saint Magnus was linked with that of the Theban Legion to lend antiquity to a local saint about whom nothing was really known. Magnus has been identified with Magnus of F√ºssen (Mang), a later monk of the same name associated with the Bavarian monastery at F√ºssen, whose cult would have spread south to Piedmont by the Benedictines. However, due to his association with the Theban Legion, Magnus was depicted as a Roman soldier holding a banner and the palm of martyrdom. He should not be confused with Magnus of Anagni, whose feast day occurs on the same day.

Soddy criticized the focus on monetary flows in economics, arguing that real wealth was derived from the use of energy to transform materials into physical goods and services. Soddy‚Äôs economic writings were largely ignored in his time, but would later be applied to the development of ecological economics in the late 20th century. Eric Zencey, \\"Mr. Soddy‚Äôs Ecological Economy\\", The New York Times, Opinion Section, April 12, 2009. Real wealth and virtual wealth In this book Soddy points out the fundamental difference between real wealth (consumables such as buildings, equipment, energy, food) and virtual wealth, in the form of money and debt. Soddy contends that real wealth is subject to entropy and will rot, rust, wear out, or be consumed over time, while money and debt (as artificial accounting devices) are subject only to the laws of mathematics, not the laws of thermodynamics. As debt compounding at some rate of interest, virtual wealth will grow effortlessly over time and without limit, instead of diminishing with use as does real wealth. Soddy uses actual occurring examples to demonstrate what he considers a major flaw of prevailing economic theory.

The results were unfavorable, indicating poor longitudinal stability at high angles of attack. The wing design was modified to address this problem, with an extension added to the trailing edge flap, and a discontinuous, leading edge droop added to the outboard section of the wings. Stall characteristics were found to be good, however, since the canard was found to provide a nose-down pitching moment at the point of a stall. These changes were tested on the second prototype before the design was frozen in April 1985.Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1987‚Äì88, p.479 Additionally, production machines were to have a redesigned fuselage of round cross-section, a redesigned nose, and additional baggage compartments.\\"Laser 300 shows changes\\" 1985, p.2\\"Omac freezes Laser 300\\" 1985, p.15 Meanwhile, OMAC relocated from its original home in Reno, Nevada to Albany, Georgia in January 1985, as an agreement had been reached with Ayres Corporation to undertake the manufacture of the aircraft at the firm's Albany plant.\\"Ayres readies Laser 300 production\\" 1985, p.13 Certification was now anticipated by mid-1986.

The history of introduction of Christianity in the present-day Abkhazia can be traced to the 1st century and in 325 the bishop of Pityus participated in the First Ecumenical Council in Nicaea. Since the late 9th century, the Orthodox dioceses of Abkhazia were subordinated to the Georgian Orthodox Church, later functioning there as the Catholicosate of Abkhazia. Eastern Orthodox Church The orthodox church in Abkhazia is officially part of the Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church (Tskhum-Apkhazeti Eparchy) with Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II as its head.Witness through troubled times : a history of the Orthodox Church of Georgia, 1811 to the present, Abashidze, Zaza.The Eastern Orthodox churches: concise histories with chronological checklists of their primates, Burgess, Michael, London. After the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, the autocephalous church of Georgia lost the control and jurisdiction over its property in Abkhazia. However, all autocephalous churches of the orthodox faith, including the Russian Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, recognise Abkhazia as part of the Georgian autocephalous church.A long walk to church: a contemporary history of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd ed, Davis, Nathaniel The Current head of the orthodox church in Abkhazia is Archbishop Daniel of Tskhum-Apkhazeti Eparchy However, the Georgian Orthodox Church is unable to operate there and most of its clerics as well as the parish have been expelled during the Abkhazian war and in its aftermath. After the war in Abkhazia, the only remaining Orthodox priest of the Georgian Church, ethnic Abkhaz Vissarion (Appliaa) headed the local Orthodox community. In the following years, the recently consecrated clerics from the neighbouring Russian Maykop Eparchy arrived in Abkhazia and soon engaged in a conflict with Vissarion. Through the mediation of Russian church officials, the two sides managed to reach a power- sharing agreement at Maikop in 2005, and organised themselves into the Eparchy of Abkhazia whose canonical status remains undefined. This failed, however, to settle the disagreement and the eparchy continues to straddle the division. Currently, there are a dozen or so Orthodox clerics in the region, most of whom belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, while the de facto head of the eparchy, Vissarion, nominally remains a subordinate to the Georgian Orthodox Patriarchate. The Georgian church officials complain that the Russian church interferes in Abkhazia by training and sending in priests loyal to Moscow. The Russian church officials published translations of the Gospels in Abkhazian, which drew protests from the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church as a violation of Orthodox Church canon law, constituting a meddling in the internal affairs of another Orthodox church and annexation of Georgian Orthodox property in Abkhazia.http://www.geotimes.ge/index.php?m=home&newsid;=2810 The Russian Orthodox Church claims that the clerics of Maykop eparchy serve in Abkhazia only temporarily as the local Orthodox believers do not have contacts with the Georgian Orthodox Church. Armenian Apostolic Church Most of the ethnic Armenians living in Abkhazia who form the second largest ethnic group in the region of Abkhazia after the Abkhaz people, forming 20% of the Abkhazian population with 45,000 out of a total of 215,000, belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. Catholic Church The Catholic Church in Abkhazia is the third largest Christian denomination and mostly consists of mainly Armenians, Poles, and expatriates living in Abkhazia. The Holy See does not have diplomatic relations with Abkhazia, but has enjoyed two high level visits from the apostolic nuncio.

The M125 bomblet was a U.S. chemical sub-munition designed to deliver the nerve agent sarin. It was brought into service in 1954 with the M34 cluster bomb as part of the first U.S. air-delivered nerve agent weapon. History The M125 bomblet was a sub-munition of the M34 cluster bomb, which was first brought into regular service by the United States Army in 1954.Smart, Jeffery K. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare : Chapter 2 -- History of Chemical and Biological Warfare: An American Perspective, (PDF: pp. 41-42), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, accessed December 28, 2008. In development the M125 was known as the E54R6 bomblet (shortened to E54). The M34 and its payload of M125s was the first air-delivered nerve agent weapon in the U.S. chemical arsenal. Later, the Chemical Corps developed chemical-biological warheads for multiple missile systems including, Matador, Rascal, Snark, and Navaho missiles. These warheads incorporated the M125 bomblet and the M114 bomblet. Over 21,000 of the M125 containing M34 bombs were destroyed at Rocky Mountain Arsenal in 1976. Specifications The M34 was designed to hold 76 M125 bomblets, arranged in four groups of 19. Each bomblet held 2.6 pounds of the nerve agent sarin, and 8.8 ounces of the explosive tetryl.Mauroni, Albert J. Chemical Demilitarization: Public Policy Aspects, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 19, (). The ten pound cylindrical M125 bomblet also held an opening delay, fuze and parachute, as well as a burster, which contained the explosive. A M34 cluster bomb, fully loaded with M125 bomblets, had an agent weight to weapon weight ratio of 17 percent; the M34 and M125 were not the best delivery system. Eventually, cylindrical chemical bomblets, such as the M125, were supplanted by spherical models because they could obtain a greater coverage area.Kirby, Reid. \\"The CB Battlefield Legacy: Understanding the Potential Problem of Clustered CB Weapons \\", Army Chemical Review, July‚ÄìDecember 2006, accessed December 28, 2008.

Because it is the start point of Min River, it acts as a trading transferring center between North Fujian, Jiangxi and Fuzhou. Also, it is the last stronghold of Fuzhou, the largest city in Fujian, and usually carefully guarded. Because the soldiers came from north China, the city's dialect was more similar to that of Henan Province.

He was a member of a group of intellectual men, poets, and playwrights including John Donne and Ben Jonson who met the first Friday of every month at the Mermaid Tavern in Bread Street. Martin was \\"universally well regarded for his warmth of nature, personal beauty, and graceful speech\\",Miles 1986, p. 58 and was elected \\"prince of Love\\" to preside over the Christmas grand revels of the Middle Temple in the winter of 1597/98.O'Callaghan 2007, p. 14 Michelle O'Callaghan points out that those elected to oversee the grand revels had to be skilled in \\"singing, dancing, and music\\", and well-versed in \\"rhetoric, law and other scholastic exercises travestied\\" in the revels. The poet John Davies dedicated his 1596 collection \\"Orchestra, or a Poeme of Dauncing\\" to Martin, but they fell out soon after, and Davies was disbarred and briefly thrown in the Tower of London in February 1598 \\"for thrashing his friend, another roysterer of the day, Mr. Richard Martin, in the Middle Temple Hall\\" with a cudgel. (Davies publicly apologized to Martin in 1601 and was readmitted to the English Bar. He went on to have a brilliant legal career.) Martin defended Jonson and his controversial 1602 play \\"The Poetaster\\" to the Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham. Later, Jonson acknowledged Martin in the dedication of the 1616 folio edition of \\"The Poetaster\\" \\"for whose innocence as for the author's you were once a noble and kindly undertaker to the greatest justice [Popham] of this kingdom.\\"Gifford 1826, p. 206 Martin is mentioned in, and was perhaps a co- author of, the poetic libel \\"The Parliament Fart\\", one of the most popular and malleable comic poems of the early Stuart era, which originated in the circle of tavern wits of which Martin was a part.

Following the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, Martin was chosen to give a speech welcoming the new King James to London on behalf of the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex as part of the celebrations of the royal entry on 7 May. In his speech, Martin reminded the king of the breadth of his new kingdom and warned of the dangers of piracy. The speech was printed that same year.Lee 2004, pp. 154-155 Martin was M.P. for Christchurch in James's first Parliament (1604‚Äì11) and Counsel to the Virginia Company from 1612. In May 1614, Martin was invited to speak before the Addled Parliament on the Colony of Virginia as lawyer for the company. From 1611 Martin had taken an active interest in the colonization of the Bermuda Islands or Somers Isles, and in 1615 was a founding shareholder of the Somers Isles Company chartered to manage the colony. On the death of Sir Anthony Benn, 29 September 1618, King James recommended Martin to the City of London for their recorder or chief counsel to the Lord Mayor, and he was chosen to the position, but died about a month after, of the smallpox, on Sunday morning 2 November 1618, and was buried in the Temple Church, London.

Early life  Graciano was born in Araras.  Career  In 1927 he was hired by the Estrada de Ferro Sorocabana (or \\"Sorocabana Railroad\\", currently Am√©rica Latina Log√≠stica), in Conchas, S√£o Paulo state, where he painted poles, signboards and warnings for the railroad stations. In 1934 he moved to S√£o Paulo to work as a clerk. From then, he divided his time between art and his job. After ten years, he was fired for excessive absences. In 1937, having encountered the art of Alfredo Volpi, Cl√≥vis Graciano took his place in the Palacete Santa Helena, becoming part of the Grupo Santa Helena, together with Francisco Rebolo, Mario Zanini, Aldo Bonadei, Fulvio Pennacchi and others, besides Volpi. Graciano befriended Portinari. In the late 1940s, he went to Paris, where he learned about mural painting. Back to Brazil, he did several panels. For instance, Armist√≠cio de Iperoig (or \\"Iperoig's truce\\"), for FAAP (1962); the panel Oper√°rio (or \\"Proletarian\\") in Avenida Moreira Guimar√£es, in S√£o Paulo city (1979), murals in Avenida Paulista, and in Di√°rio Popular's building. In 1971, he worked as director of S√£o Paulo State Pinacotheca, and as president of the S√£o Paulo's State Board for Visual Arts, and of the S√£o Paulo's State Council for Culture. Besides painting, Graciano worked in several different activities in parallel, teaching scenography in EAD (USP's drama school), and illustration newspapers, magazines and books, particularly in the 1980s. Throughout his career, Graciano was faithful to Figurativism, and never felt a slight attraction to abstract art. He worked extensively with social themes, like the migrants, besides themes with musicians and dancers. He died in S√£o Paulo, aged 81. His works are held by museums and private collections in Brazil and abroad.

Camp Lehman sat on of land donated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and housed 582 adult male prisoners. The camp had prisoner public works and gate pass assignments. http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,1607,7-119-9741_9746---,00.html History Camp Lehman was named after Ray Lehman, a District Supervisor of Paroles who was killed in World War II in February 1943. Camp Lehman was established as one of the original Honor system camps when the Corrections Conservation Prison Camp Program was started in 1948 and housed minimum security adult male prisoners. The purpose of the Corrections Conservation Prison Camp Program was twofold. Various conservation projects under the direction of the Conservation Department (now the Michigan Department of Natural Resources or DNR) needed to be manned and prisoners provided an inexpensive and reliable source of labor. The Corrections Camp Program was granted permission to use old Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps in exchange for prisoners to be used on these conservation projects. The Conservation Department provided employees to supervise these prisoners and vehicles to transport the prisoners to and from the assignments. When the old buildings of the CCC became unsuitable to house prisoners, a new building (renamed Superior unit, in 1986) was constructed on the site where the facility is now located. This building was built in 1963-64 to accommodate 80 prisoners and included all necessary functions of a correctional facility within one building. Over the years the facility added other buildings to accommodate growth of the prisoner population. The largest expansion of the Camp was in 1986 when three new eighty single-prisoner-room housing units named Michigan unit, Huron unit, Erie unit, were added. Also added at that time an activity building (Ontario unit) which primarily served as an activity/visiting room. Upon the completion of the new housing units the camp housed 342 prisoners. The housing units and activity building were named after the Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario), that surround Michigan. In 1987 a high security fence was constructed. This security fence was enhanced in 1999 and 2000 to electronically detect any suspicious movement on the fence. On October 1, 1997, the Corrections Camp Program was disbanded and each remaining camp became the responsibility of the closest correctional facility. Camp Lehman‚Äôs parent facility was the Standish Maximum Correctional Facility in Standish, Michigan; until July 2009, when the camp became the responsibility of the Pugsley Correctional Facility Kingsley, Michigan. In June 2003, the prisoner population increased to 582 prisoners by double bunking each of the three eighty room housing units. Superior unit housed 102 prisoners; Michigan, Huron, and Erie units each housed 160 prisoners. In six decades Camp Lehman saw many changes. Originally the Camp was only to serve to provide labor for the Conservation Department but evolved into a correctional facility with a multitude of programs and functions. Camp Lehman provided labor to various public authorities including the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Military Affairs at Camp Grayling Army National Guard Training Site. Prisoners were compensated for their labor and the State of Michigan was reimbursed for the cost of operating the program by the various public entities that utilized the program. As of October 1, 2007 the Camp had 5 prisoner work crews. The number of employees increased over the years according to the number of prisoners housed and the increase in programs and functions. In 1977, a total of 15 employees operated the Camp, of which 11 were custody and security staff. In October 2007, the camp employed 107 employees of which 67 were custody and security staff until its closure in October 2009. On February 1, 2009, Camp Lehman became a tobacco-free facility. The possession and use of tobacco products by prisoners, staff, and the general public was prohibited. http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,1607,7-119-1381_1383-200148--,00.html On June 5, 2009, Regional Prison Administrator Jerri Ann Sherry arrived at Camp Lehman to announce to the staff that after more than sixty years of service to the People of the State of Michigan, Camp Lehman would be closed prior to November 1, 2009. She also announced in addition to Camp Lehman closing the other four remaining prison camps: Camp Cusino in Shingleton, Camp Kitwen in Painsedale, Camp Ottawa in Iron River, and Camp White Lake in White Lake Township would also be closed. These closures signaled an end to the Corrections Camp Program.http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/FYI_2009-06-05_SE_281459_7.pdf Also, on June 5, 2009, Governor Jennifer Granholm released a statement to the media to announce the State of Michigan would be closing the Hiawatha Correctional Facility, in Kincheloe; the Muskegon Correctional Facility, in Muskegon, MI; and the Standish Maximum Correctional Facility before November 1, 2009. The last of the prisoners were transferred to other facilities on Friday, October 30, 2009. Camp Lehman closed on October 31, 2009. Camp Lehman was the final prison camp opened in Michigan; and with its closure marked the end of the Corrections Camp Program in the State of Michigan. Programs and services Camp Lehman provided the following prisoner programs: Adult Basic Education; General Education Development; http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,1607,7-119-9741_9747---,00.html a pre- release program; substance abuse treatment; Alcoholics Anonymous & Narcotics Anonymous; Assaultive Offender Therapy ; Thinking for A Change classes; parenting classes; smoking cessation classes; and group counseling and had a law library http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/05_03_115_242618_7.pdf that provided services for prisoners from throughout Michigan who were housed in Camps. The camp had a Health Care Unit that provided prisoners access to a physician assistant, nursing, dental and psychological services. http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,1607,7-119-9741_9744-23249--,00.html Recreation for the prisoners included a gymnasium; softball field; outdoor basketball courts; outdoor handball court; weight pavilion; music room; in- room- hobbycraft;;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/05_03_102_185536_7.pdf walking/running track; and exercise stations. Equipment for these leisure-time activities was provided by the Prisoner Benefit Fund http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/04_02_110_242614_7.pdf which was funded directly from the prisoner store and other prisoner fundraising functions. Camp Lehman also provided a variety of religious services http://www.michigan.gov/documents/corrections/05_03_150_261312_7.pdf overseen by the Prison Chaplain at the Pugsley Correctional Facility and aided by approved religious volunteer groups from the local community.

Padmanabham is regarded as one of the finest comic actors of India, noted particularly for his comic expressions, and dialogues during the golden age of Telugu cinema. Padmanabham was essentially a theatre artist, although he also found success in cinema, and has acted in over 400 feature films. He made his film debut in 1945 with Mayalokam. He co-founded a Theatre group with his friend Vallam Narasimha Rao, Rekha and Murali Arts with S. P. Kodandapani as their music director. The veteran finds it hard to mention any particular comic role as his most memorable one, but makes a special mention of the role of a rickshaw puller that he played in Desoddhaarakudu (1975). \\"It had ample measure of 'karuna rasa' in it and I could display the other shade of my talent,\\" he says. The role became famous for the song 'Aakalayyi Annamadigithe Pichchodannaru Naayaallu'. Padmanabham, who directed eightfilms in all, introduced S.P. Balasubrahmanyam to the film industry through Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna. Kathanayika Molla, which he directed in 1969 fetched him the Nandi Award. Early life and career He was born to Santham and Basavaraju Venkata Seshaiah in Simhadripuram, Pulivendula, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh on August 20, 1931. Padmanabham started acting at the age of 12 when the legendary director Gudavalli Ramabrahmam gave him a break in \\"Maayalokam (1943)\\". He worked with almost 80 directors and acted in more than 400 movies in his long career. Padmanabham cherishes most his association with Gudavalli Ramabrahmam, Ghantasala Balaramayya, L. V. Prasad and K. V. Reddy. Death Padmanabham died at his residence at Rangarajapuram, Kodambakkam, in Chennai at 8 a.m. on 20 February 2010 from a heart attack. He was 78 and is survived by wife, five daughters and a son. The veteran actor had been a regular yoga practitioner and enjoyed good health till his death.

He was seconded to the Federal Government during World War II and was known throughout his career for designing a number of the influential steam locomotives for operation in Western Australia, including a number of controversial designs. No fewer than four Royal Commissions were held into various aspects of WAGR operations ‚Äì including an examination of the safety of the Australian Standard Garratt locomotive and other aspects pertinent to its design and development ‚Äì during his tenure, all of them into issues against which Mills himself fought unceasingly. Biography Frederick Mills was born in England in 1898. He served for six years as an apprentice fitter-and-turner with R&W; Hawthorn Leslie & Co at Newcastle upon Tyne and after passing the necessary examination was admitted to that company's drawing office during his apprenticeship. He served in the Royal Air Force and on de-mobilisation became a draughtsman with Sir WG Armstrong-Whitworth & Co, another well-known builder. While working for his two British employers, Mills participated in the design of locomotives for export to railways throughout the world. In 1926, on the recommendation of Sir WG Armstrong-Whitworth & Co, he was appointed Designing Draughtsman for the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) and emigrated to Western Australia. He was promoted to Chief Draughtsman in 1931.Bertola, P and Oliver, B (Eds.), 'The Workshop: A History of the Midland Government Railway Workshops', 2006, University of Western Australia Press, Perth During 1928 Mills was handed the responsibility for designing the first Garratt type of locomotive built in Australia. The design was similar to the M class supplied by Beyer, Peacock & Co, but the lengthening of the firebox required work to be done on the re-distribution of weight and the pivots. During the 1930s, Mills submitted plans for a new 4-8-2 locomotive class to assist in Western Australia's failing railway system. They would become the WAGR S Class, the only locomotive to be completely conceived, designed and built at the Midland Railway Workshops.Gunzburg, Adrian.(1984) A history of W.A.G.R. steam locomotives Perth, W.A : Australian Railway Historical Society, Western Australian Division. Despite his insistence that their construction constituted essential war work, production of the S Class was postponed, and it wasn't until 1943 that the first three of an eventual total of ten were placed into service. The S class was to prove one of the more controversial of Western Australia's locomotives; suffering from a variety of early problems due to Mills' implementation of some bold new ideas. However, despite numerous complaints from various railway unions they eventually became solid performers. Mills was just as well-educated in engineering theory as railway locomotive design practice. In 1939 he relieved the Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Western Australia. He was a Member of the Institution of Engineers Australia, the North East Coast Institution of Engineers & Shipbuilders, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institution of Locomotive Engineers. As a graduate of the second of those worthy bodies, Mills won special prizes for his papers on locomotive boilers and steam locomotive design and construction. He published in the engineering press several articles on locomotive and rollingstock design and read papers before the Institution of Engineers. Also in 1939, the James F Lincoln Arc Welding Foundation of the United States conducted a worldwide competition for papers on new applications of electric welding. Mills won the ¬£1,000 first prize in the Railway Locomotive section for his design of a welded engine frame. In 1940 he was appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer. During World War II the WAGR, like other Australian railway systems, was facing severe economic crisis. The problems in Western Australia, however, were exaggerated by a succession of State Governments having provided little for the railways, meaning that they had not yet recovered from the effects of the Great Depression.Rogers, P., 'Troops, Trains and Trades: The Wartime Role of the Railways of Western Australia, 1939‚Äì1945 Approximately half of the WAGR's locomotive fleet dated back before the turn of the century, and by 1943 a quarter were out of service pending overhaul. Wartime service with the Commonwealth Land Transport Board In 1942, Mills was seconded to the Federal Government to lead a team tasked with providing a design for a new standard-class narrow-gauge locomotive; the result being the Australian Standard Garratt of which 25 were used by the WAGR from a total of 57 locomotives built.Whiting, Alan: Engine of Destruction ‚Äì The Australian Standard Garratt Scandal,‚ÇØ‚ÇØ 1988, The class were all withdrawn within fifteen years. The War in the Pacific had turned Australia into a military base, with no state more affected than Queensland due to its strategic location vis √° vis the Pacific theatre. The Australian and American military machines required of the Queensland Railways (QR) a logistical task that they were hard-pressed to accommodate; in fact a worse situation could scarcely be imagined. When the military forces needed machinery, people, and supplies moved in vast quantities as a matter of priority they had at their disposal the modest infrastructure of QR; light-weight track and structures, a tortuous geographic profile, unpretentious locomotives with low axle-loads, and train lengths limited by these factors. Added to that was the proportion of current QR motive-power that was rotating through overhaul and repair. Against this background, the requirement for extra, effective motive-power in Queensland (and to a slightly lesser-extent, the rest of the nation) was identified as a critical requirement. Mills was an eminent locomotive engineer and had considerable experience in locomotive design but he lacked one quality that was to increase the friction that was later to develop between his new employer (the Commonwealth Ministry of Munitions) and QR in the design and introduction of the ASG. Mills was not overly-tolerant or possessed of an excess of humility; in fact he was arrogant, authoritarian and obstinate. Given the hostility that later developed between QR and those in wartime control of the nation‚Äôs railways over the design and introduction of the ASG, the personalities of Mills and Victorian Railways' Commissioner Harold Clapp were to have significance in some absurd circumstances that were to follow. George Lawson, Federal Minister for Transport in 1942, was responsible for the administration of the National Security Act (1942) and Regulations. These gave the Commonwealth full power and authority to control rail and road transport and do all things necessary to give effect to the regulations. This included provision for setting up the Commonwealth Land Transport Board (CLTB) which was charged with giving effect to the regulations and directing what rail and road transport services should be maintained and the terms and conditions of operation. The CLTB was also responsible for the acquisition, by purchase or manufacture, of any required vehicles and accessories and to operate and use them and determine routes and priorities of transport. The eminence of Victorian Railway's Commissioner Harold Winthrop Clapp as a railway manager resulted in his appointment by Lawson as the Director-General of the CLTB. In this position Clapp was empowered to authorise and direct all CLTB activity. In April 1942, Joseph Ellis Commissioner of Railways for Western Australia since 1934 and being now ‚Äî as Director of Locomotive and Rollingstock Construction in the Commonwealth Ministry of Munitions ‚Äî a member of the CLTB, was requested by the War Railway Committee to examine Australia‚Äôs 3' 6-gauge railway systems (but most specifically that of Queensland) as to the practicability of using Garratt-type locomotives, and advise the CLTB. The War Railway Committee was composed of the Director-General of Land Transport, the Commissioners of the State and Commonwealth railway systems, the Director of Rail Transport, a nominee of the Minister for Army, and two rail union representatives. Ellis was an appropriate appointee. He had been an engineer for the Queensland Railways from 1910 to 1926, and the WAGR had used Garratt locomotives for some 30 years (the M class, originally ordered in 1911, being the first main-line Garratts ever built). His secret report ‚Äî to a singular Term of Reference ‚Äî would be used to justify the acquisition of what would become known as the Australian Standard Garratt, to alleviate a wartime motive-power deficit most critically being felt in Queensland. It is perhaps understandable that Ellis chose both his home-state Chief Mechanical Engineer and Assistant Secretary (C. Raymond) to assist in the investigation which eventually arrived at a recommendation to use the Garratt type for all Australian narrow-gauge systems; QR itself apparently not represented in the eventual recommendation. Once the decision had been made to proceed with the ASG, Ellis elevated Mills to Controller of Locomotive and Rollingstock Construction for the Ministry of Munitions with responsibility for the actual design work. In the course of their investigation Ellis and Mills had become aware of the Beyer-Peacock & Co. outline drawing ‚Ññ 120328 for a light Garratt- type locomotive and it is apparent that it was on this drawing that Mills later based the specifications for the locomotive he would propose, and go on to design. Mills' design for the ASG was thus a variation of this drawing but he does not appear to have drawn great attention to the fact that he used it as the basis of his plan; hardly surprising as he was a proud man and proud of his design. If it had worked to everybody's satisfaction it would have been an historic first; the only steam locomotive ever designed and built in Australia for availability on all narrow-gauge systems. At a time when the administrators of the QR had lost the legal right to conduct their empire as they pleased, the way in which the Commonwealth officers approached their task was vital if proper organisation was to be achieved. Clapp and Mills could never be described as conducting their task with tact insofar as the Queenslanders were concerned. For various reasons the QR did not agree that the ASG was the best locomotive for Queensland and did not accept the decision to build them with any degree of enthusiasm. The means of acquisition of the locomotives thus became the next challenge for the participants. United States builders were too preoccupied with their own wartime production to construct the locomotives, so this left only Great Britain as a manufacturing source if they were not to be built in Australia (although perhaps with some of the material to be obtained from the United States). The problem of British construction was twofold; Britain was at the height of its war effort and it was unrealistic to think that the British could embark on the construction of 127 (as was originally planned) large locomotives when their own munitions industries were pressed to the limit and their ships desperately needed for military transport and supply tasks. The other problem was that the ships involved and their cargos would have risked being lost to enemy action during the long voyage. The British were alive to these problems and Ellis was advised that priority, if any, could be allocated only following a firm order to Britain. If a high priority were then obtained and if a co-operative scheme could be established Australia could probably expect to receive three units per week with the first deliveries to be made six months after order. One further possibility was for the end-user to build the locomotives themselves under licence from Beyer-Peacock & Co in which case (at that time) a licence fee would have been payable. Enquiries of the WAGR in late 1922 had revealed that Beyer-Peacock & Co had requested ¬£850 per unit as a licence fee for the Garratts the WAGR had at that time been planning to build itself. Up until 1927, the only lawful manner of obtaining a Garratt was to either have Beyer- Peacock & Co build it or, as was sometimes the case when that firm had sufficient work in hand, a company might be licensed by it to do the work upon payment of a fee. After 1927 however, the global monopoly of Beyer-Peacock & Co, had expired as Garratt's patent came to an end. Anyone obtaining a set of Garratt plans could simply build more of them whenever they wished. Hence it would have been possible for the QR or any entity to build its own Garratts if it so desired or privately if the railway or entity could obtain the plans and adapt them accordingly. Common sense dictates though that it would be wise to use the established experience of Beyer-Peacock & Co to either draw a set of plans specifically for the end-user and to construct at least some of the locomotives in Manchester or to have that company superintend construction at the end-user's facility. So it was that QR found itself pressed by the CLTB to provide the workshop capacity to construct the locomotives, while struggling to maintain its own war-worn fleet. Although QR had agitated unceasingly for adoption of its B18¬º and C17 classes for the motive-power expansion, Ellis' report neglects to mention the fact that the plans, jigs and patterns for these were immediately available and delivery of them could have been commenced immediately subject only to the availability of material. The C17 could run on the WAGR and the Tasmanian Government Railways, and as the NM class had already run on the Commonwealth Railways. It seems, therefore, simply common sense that at least one QR officer should have been included in the team of designers of the ASG although, incredibly, not a single one was involved. Special appeals were made by the CLTB to QR to obtain representation so that the locomotive practices of QR would be known in designing the ASG and with the benefit that at least some QR staff would become familiar with the locomotive (after all, the QR was to get ten of the thirty to be built). The appeals were to no avail; QR stated emphatically that no assistance could be given, and in view of the then state of locomotive maintenance in Queensland, Mills felt that little could be done to combat its attitude. The South Australian Railways resisted Commonwealth requests to defer a programme of locomotive construction but eventually agreed to assemble twelve ASGs at its Islington Railway Workshops although it refused to make officers available to assist with the design work. The New South Wales Government Railways could not undertake assembly work, because its workshops were equipped for only maintenance and new workshops built for locomotive construction were making munitions. They did agree though, that their locomotives then being built by Clyde Engineering could be deferred in favour of that company assembling ASGs, and promised staff to carry out inspections of construction. The Tasmanian Government Railways, claimed Mills, also agreed to defer its locomotive construction programme and the Victorian Railways and WAGR agreed likewise and further, offered their workshops as assembly places. Thus assembly was to take place at four locations: Midland Railway Workshops (Western Australia), Islington Railway Workshops (South Australia), Newport Workshops (Victoria), and Clyde Engineering (New South Wales). As a consequence Mills surrounded himself with twelve design staff from the various systems as follows: NSWGR ‚Äì 6, VR ‚Äì 4, WAGR ‚Äì 1, and TGR ‚Äì 1. The VR provided premises in Melbourne for the drawing office and lent other officers to assist the ASG programme in other ways. The absurdity had been reached though, that most of the designers were to come from the states that were not going to be allocated any ASGs and whose systems were wider-gauge. The first ASGs eventually commenced service with QR, with a VR locomotive inspector provided to assist the Queensland enginemen. They were considered by both QR and its enginemen to be deficient in many respects ‚Äî and later, perhaps even unsafe due to their unflanged leading driving wheels ‚Äî and met with great resistance. Mills' intransigence to criticism did not place him in a good light following an eventual Royal Commission into the ASG and also meant that modifications that may have resulted in their successful operation were delayed or refused and the locomotives were finally withdrawn to become monuments to human folly of various categories; but perhaps mostly hubris. In his comprehensive historical work (see ref. 4 below) Alan Whiting has a final, erudite word on the conception and development of the ASG. He states of the development and construction of the ASG, \\"The reality was, despite the QRG's lethargy, whether justifiable or not, there is no excuse for the Commonwealth through the agency of Clapp and Mills, visiting upon the QGR and its military users what stands out as a disaster unprecedented in the history of locomotive engineering in Australia.\\" Locomotive Designs From his appointment as Locomotive Design Draftsman in 1926 a new era of locomotive design for the WAGR began. Designs introduced by Mills over his career include: *WAGR Dm Class 4-6-4T *WAGR S Class 4-8-2 (the only class of steam locomotive to be completely conceived, designed and built at the Midland Railway Workshops) *WAGR Dd Class 4-6-4T *Australian Standard Garratt *WAGR W Class 4-8-2 References Category:Australian railway mechanical engineers Category:History of Western Australia Category:Locomotive builders and designers Category:1898 births Category:1949 deaths Category:20th-century Australian engineers ","title":"Frederick Mills (engineer)"},{"id":"20871748","text":"Versailles‚ÄìChantiers is the principal railway station serving the city of Versailles.

Anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading terrain and soil. An area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural, such as grasslands that have been deforested by humans. It can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of urbanization because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action.  Cause  The earliest known stages of anthropization can be found as early as the Neolithic era and the basic farmland created in that time. With the continually-growing population of humans, the land that the Earth provides has been appropriated over the years. The ecological footprint created by anthropization is continually growing despite efficiency and technique improvements made in anthropization.. Whether anthropized or not, all land seldom a few locations has been claimed. Outside of the largely inhospitable Arctic and Antarctic circles and large portions of other uninhabitable landscapes, much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans. Land has been appropriated for many different reasons, but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans. An area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing, to harvest the resources, to create space for some anthropological reason, or many other possibilities.  Processes and effects  cultivation in Hainan, China. = Agriculture = The root of many early forms of civilization, agriculture has been a primary reason for anthropization. To cultivate food or breed animals, humans must alter land‚Äîtill soil or build structures‚Äîto facilitate agriculture. This can lead to soil erosion and pollution (pesticides, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.), and subsequently habitat fragmentation and overall an increased ecological footprint. Agriculture and industry often overlap, and industry produces many of these effects too. = Urban development = Especially with approximately 7.5 Billion humans inhabiting the Earth, this typically aligns with an increase in residences worldwide. Over the years, humans have built on land to meet their needs and wants. These actions range from small villages to massive factories, water parks, and apartments. Urbanization and development of human residences can significantly affect the environment. Not only does the physical space of buildings fragment habitats and possibly endanger species, but it fundamentally alters the habitat for any other living being. For some species, this effect can be inconsequential, but for many this can have a dramatic impact. The biosphere is very much interconnected, and this means that if one organism is affected, then as a result the other organisms within this ecosystem and food chain are also affected. Athabasca oil sands are an example of anthropization as a result of the harvest and transport of a non-renewable resource, oil sands. As well, within the last century, any urbanized area requires roads for transportation. This transportation is a continued source of pollution, and the roads can be a source of soil erosion. = Industry and technology = To support humans, industrial buildings and processes are apparently essential. Urban development and agriculture require that people produce, refined, or construct many things. Key to this is that factories require that people gather the materials they need to create a product. The wide range of products in this anthropological age use a plethora of substances that must be harvested or produced. Many of these materials are non-renewable (e.g., fossil fuel, metal ores, etc.) and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization. For resources that depend on in high quantity, this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource (e.g., depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves, improper or inefficient silviculture, etc.). Even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment. While the resource in question may not be in jeopardy, the harvest and processing can still change and damage the environment.  Science  Anthropization can also be a result of scientific endeavours. This can manifest as construction of structures to aid in scientific discovery and observation. This can range from structures such as observatories, or on the opposite scale the Large Hadron Collider. These and many other things are built and used to enhance knowledge of sciences. They do however require space and energy.  Energy  To power the ever- growing human race, energy is needed. Power-harvesting structures are built to harness energy, such as dams, windmills, and nuclear reactors. These sources of energy ultimately fuel the rest of anthropological activity and are essential in this way. However many of these methods have consequences. With dams, construction aside, they can cause flooding, habitat fragmentation, and other effects. With nuclear reactors, they have a lasting effect in that typically a lifespan of one of these is around 50 years and afterwards the nuclear waste must be dealt with, and the structure itself must be shut down and cannot be used further. To safely dispose of this even low-level waste can take hundreds of years, ranging upwards with increased radioactivity.Miller, G. Tyler, David F. Hackett, and Carl Eric Wolfe. Living in the Environment. 4th ed. Toronto: Nelson Education, 2017. 454-55. Print. To produce and as a result of this production of energy, it requires a lot of anthropized land.  Evolution of anthropization  An example of ancient anthropization; Giza pyramid complex, Egypt. Changes in population directly effect anthropological impact‚Äîbut changes in technology and knowledge have greatly changed anthropization throughout the Holocene. The tools and methods that humans use to anthropize have changed drastically. For examples, the great pyramids in Egypt were not constructed by some large machine, but instead by thousands of humans. They were still able to build massive monuments, but the efficiency of their efforts and environmental damage is much different than today. This shows that the environmental effect of modern anthropization is generally greater, not just because of the increase in population. Pollution and loss of biodiversity in Egypt was largely natural, not man-made, and anthropization existed on a much lower level. As the human population of Earth increase, this anthropization will continue to evolve.

Until 2005, bolandione was available without prescription in United States, where it was marketed as a prohormone, but it is now classified as a Schedule III drug. It is also banned from use in many sports, including the Olympic Games, under the World Anti-Doping Code. Bolandione is readily metabolized to nandrolone after oral administration, but its potency to transactivate the androgen receptor dependent reporter gene expression is 10 times lower as compared to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Scientific studies have shown that oral administration of bolandione is \\"a very ineffective strategy for stimulating skeletal muscle mass increases but may be associated with side effects\\". In vivo experiments in castrated rats demonstrated that subcutaneous treatment with bolandione resulted only in a stimulation of the weight of the levator ani muscle, while the prostate and seminal vesicle weights remained completely unaffected. In contrast to its metabolite nandrolone, bolandione highly selectively stimulates the growth of the skeletal muscles but has only weak androgenic properties. In the early 2000s, contamination of androstenedione products with traces of bolandione caused false positives for doping tests for nandrolone because 19-norandrosterone is a metabolite of both nandrolone and bolandione. In a randomized controlled trial trace contamination of androstenedione with bolandione was sufficient for users of androstenedione to test positive for nandrolone. This detail became less relevant after bolandione and 4-androstenedione were banned by major sporting bodies.

Political background According to reports in The Times, popular opinion was swinging against the coalition government of David Lloyd George and Bonar Law and the Independent, Asquithian Liberals were making the most of the government's popularity to revive.The Times, London, 8 March 1919 CandidatesCoalition= The Liberal candidate at the 1918 general election, John Henderson, who had been Liberal MP for West Aberdeenshire since 1906 The Times guide to the House of Commons Vol. 3, 1910-1918., London: Politico's Publishing 2004, p.108. had only lost to Gordon by the narrow margin of 638 votes. Henderson had been expected to be the Liberals' by-election candidate. In fact, because of Henderson's strong showing at the general election and the traditional strength of the Liberal Party in the area, the Coalition whips were apparently prepared to endorse him for the by-election, giving him the equivalent of coalition coupon which had been offered to authorised candidates at the 1918 general election. Henderson, no doubt eager to return to Parliament, and fully supported by the local Liberal Association, had reportedly made his peace with Freddie Guest, Lloyd George's Chief Whip. However the local Conservatives were not happy with this arrangement and decided to stand their own candidate, Mr L F W Davidson.The Times, London, 19 March 1919 This situation proved depressing for the Coalition leaders and no 'coupon' was forthcoming for either Henderson or Davidson by the time the by-election writ was moved on 24 March.The Times, London, 22 March 1919 =Liberal= Henderson further muddied the waters by standing down as Liberal candidate and the local Association turned instead to Major Murdoch McKenzie Wood, a barrister and former Gordon Highlander, who had unsuccessfully fought Ayr Burghs at the 1918 general election.The Times, London, 14 April 1919 By the time the by-election campaigning was properly under way, the 'coupon', such as it was, had presumably been bestowed on Davidson as he was described in the election literature and the press as the Coalition Unionist or Coalition Conservative candidate. =Labour= The contest was a three-cornered affair, with Joseph F. Duncan, the general secretary of the Scottish Farm Servants' Union, fighting the seat for Labour.The Times, London, 26 March 1919. The popularity of the Coalition Duncan's candidacy was expected to complicate the possible outcome of the election by splitting the anti-Coalition vote.The Times, London, 15 April 1919 In the event, this turned out to be the case but not by quite enough to deliver the seat to the Coalition candidate and Wood was returned to Parliament with a majority of 186 over Davidson. However the combined Liberal and Labour vote amounted to 63.9% of the poll and was clearly a severe blow to the Coalition, coming so soon after their overwhelming success in the 1918 general election and hard on the heels of other by-election defeats in Hull and Leyton West. As was pointed out in The Times, no Coalition seat could be considered safe given the temper of the electorate at the time and the Coalition coupon which had been a talisman for candidates a few short weeks before was turning into a curse.The Times, London, 1 May 1919.

A selected list of common words is presented below, under Documented list of common misspellings. Although the word common is subjective depending on the situation, the focus is on general writing, rather than in a specific field. Official spellings also vary by country or region, with some rejecting the American or British variants as incorrect for the region. Within a particular field of study, such as computer graphics, other words might be more common for misspelling, such as \\"pixel\\" misspelled as \\"pixle\\" (or variants \\"cesium\\" and \\"caesium\\"). Sometimes words are purposely misspelled, as a form in slang, abbreviations, or in song lyrics, etc. In general writing, some words are frequently misspelled, such as the incorrect spelling \\"\\" for \\"consensus\\" found in numerous webpages. Other common misspellings include \\"\\" (for \\"equipment\\"), \\"\\" (for \\"independent\\"), \\"readible\\" (for readable), or \\"usible\\" (for usable or useable).  Unlimited misspellings  Because many words can be extended with prefixes (such as \\"un-\\" or \\"anti-\\" or \\"re-\\") or suffixes (such as \\"-ly\\" or \\"-ing\\" or \\"-ness\\"), a comprehensive list of words prone to misspelling would contain thousands of variations from combining prefixes or suffixes (or both) added to the root words. To limit the scope to common words, the top 350 words are considered (according to various sources).

Hence, phonetic misspelling is common, once a word is mispronounced. For example, the word realise may be misspelled as \\"\\". = Typing errors = Some spelling errors are introduced because the typing of certain people is not perfect, such as * letters are doubled, or more frequently double letters tripled, such as \\"\\" and \\"\\" * letters are singled, such as \\"\\" * keys are transposed, so \\"because\\" becomes \\"\\". (see Teh) Some of the errors listed may be due to mistyping rather than ignorance, for example \\"solider\\" for \\"soldier\\", although these forms of errors rarely ever happen in handwritten text. = Homophones = Two (or more) differently spelled words with different meanings are homophones if they are nonetheless pronounced the same; e.g., \\"right\\", \\"rite\\", \\"wright\\", and \\"write\\"; \\"read\\" (most tenses of verb) and \\"reed\\"; \\"read\\" (past, past participle) and \\"red\\". This list includes only a few homophones although incorrect use of homophones is a very common error; the following words from the list are all correct English words, though often incorrectly used in place of their homophones: * advice * affect * artic (colloquial UK usage for \\"articulated lorry\\") * aweful * breath * calender * capital * dose * its * lightening * loose * loosing * planing * principal * reign * rime * sight * soldier * stoping * they're * wether * you're Spell checkers do not detect incorrect use of homophones. = Personal names = Personal names and surnames may be pronounced like a standard English word, but with different spelling: \\"balance\\" and \\"\\"; \\"war\\" and \\"Evelyn Waugh\\"; \\"marshal\\" and \\"George Marshall\\". Personal names do, of course, generally start with a capital letter. = Foreign writers = A misspelling in English might be made by someone used to a different spelling in another language; for example, \\"address\\" is translated \\"\\" in French and German. Many Spanish words are similar or identical to English words, but with an \\"n\\" inserted, or replacing an \\"m\\", leading to errors: \\"\\" from \\"\\", \\"\\" from \\"\\", \\"\\" instead of \\"comfortable\\". The English word 'lose' reasonably looks like it should be pronounced as 'lose' to Germans, as in German the lone 's' often has the sound of an English 'z', and a lone 'o' in English very seldom has the 'oo' sound. = Apostrophes = There can be confusion over a plural possessive form. If the singular is \\"book's title\\" and the plural \\"books' titles\\", the latter can appear as \\"book's\\", or even \\"books's\\". The plural can be written with an erroneous apostrophe (\\"grocer's apostrophe\\" in Britain): \\"apple's and pear's\\". Elision can lead to misspelling: \\"doesn't\\", where the apostrophe represents the elided \\"o\\", can be misspelled \\"\\".

History The Capricorn Cougars were one of ten foundation teams in the QSL formed in 2008. In 2008 the Capricorn Cougars coach was Justin Kilshaw. He resigned after round 4 after conflict occurred between the coaches objectives and outcomes for the team, in comparison to the Boards requirements on player selections for the team. The current coach is Bradley Smith, who is a locally grown coach with great knowledge of the region. He had previously been Assistant Coach to Kilshaw in 2008 and was quickly appointed Head Coach after Kilshaw's resignation. In 2008 Cougars player Michael Cay was selected in Soccer International's top 50 players in Australia outside the A-League. Another player who has been successful at the Cougars is Tristan Fraser who was hand picked by Ian Ferguson, the coach of the new A-League team North Queensland Fury to attend a training session in Townsville prior to the 2009‚Äì2010 season. Capricorn Cougars aim to provide the highest level of football possible for local talent throughout their district. However, due to the geographical distance between the major towns in Central Queensland; Rockhampton, Gladstone, Yeppoon, Emerald and Biloela the Cougars struggle to represent the zone as a whole with the majority of the squad being based in Rockhampton. The Capricorn Cougars coach Brad Smith has been quoted saying, \\"We are not going to beg players to play\\" hinting that those who want to play at the highest level available still have the opportunity but they must want to play and train and go through the trial process. The Capricorn Cougars have been criticised in the past for not offering to take in the best players from Gladstone and favouring Rockhampton based players in the past.

Recruit Global Staffing is Holland's second-largest employment company behind Randstad. The firm has a presence in thirteen countries in Central and Western Europe, operating temporary employment agencies and providing secondment and other HR services. Predecessor USG People was formed by the 1997 merger of the companies Unique International and Goudsmit, and was known as United Services Group between 2001 and 2005. The company was listed on Euronext Amsterdam as well as a constituent of the mid-cap AMX stock market index. In 2016 the Recruit Holdings (based in Japan) acquired all shares of USG People for 1.42 billion euros. History The company in its current form was founded from the 1997 merger between the Benelux staffing firm Unique International B.V. and the publicly traded Goudsmit N.V., a holding company involved in various sectors including recruitment. The enlarged group changed its name to United Services Group N.V. in 2001. In 2002 United Services Group acquired a controlling stake in the job agency Start Holding, which had been privatised by the Dutch government six years earlier. This was later expanded to full control. The deal gave USG an increased presence in countries such as Spain and Italy. The company acquired smaller Belgian peer Solvus Resource Group for around ‚Ç¨585 million in August 2005, after which it again changed its name to USG People N.V. In late 2008 the company adopted a \\"poison pill\\" defence against potential acquisitors by issuing preference shares to a company foundation. Operations The company operates around 1,350 branches across 10 European countries. The Dutch market remains the largest for the company, contributing nearly 40% of all revenues. Belgium and Luxembourg, France, Germany and Spain are the next largest regional divisions of the firm. By far the company's largest business segment is general temporary work agencies, which operate under the unified Start People brand across all countries. USG also owns a number of specialist staffing agencies, recruiting into professions such as administration, finance, secretarial work and health care. Its professional division covers the recruitment and secondment of staff in skilled fields including engineering, telecommunications and IT, while the company also provides various other services in the field of customer services.

The measure amended the Oregon Constitution and was passed by the voters. Background The measure amended the Oregon Constitution providing crime victims an effective processes for enforcing remedy by due course of law for violations of the constitutional rights in criminal prosecutions and juvenile delinquency proceedings. These rights included the rights to: be present during specified proceedings, refuse defendants' discovery requests, receive restitution, obtain transcripts, consult about specified plea negotiations). The version of the constitution at the time this measure was put forward denied victims effective processes for enforcing these rights in court. The measure provides victims may assert claim based on these rights in pending cases or, absent pending case, by mandamus. It authorizes legislature to enact implementing legislation. It would however, allow victims to obtain compensation, invalidate an accusatory instrument, conviction or adjudication, terminate a criminal or juvenile delinquency proceeding, or suspend such proceeding if suspension would violate defendant's constitutional rights. Estimate of Financial Impact The direct financial impact to state and local governments was indeterminate because the impact depended on how often a victim would choose to bring an enforcement action to protect rights guaranteed under section 42, Article I of the Oregon Constitution, but denied by the court, district attorney or other public agency. These additional challenges could arise before a criminal case is filed, after a case is filed, and after the entry of a final judgment in a criminal case. Actions could be pursued in cases involving person and property crimes in violation, misdemeanor and felony cases, and the victim could file an enforcement action more than one time in a single case. Some cases involve multiple victims, each of whom could bring an individual enforcement action. The measure authorizes the legislature to enact laws providing detailed procedures for claims by victims, including the establishment of reasonable limitations on the time allowed victims to assert their rights and prescribing procedures for appeal. Legislation providing such procedures and limitations could change the direct costs of this measure. Direct costs may also be impacted by the degree of change in the current practice of restitution orders and payment, how many new victims are identified by the court, and the number of challenges that are appealed to a higher court.

It succeeded to an earlier magazine called Semaine de France and was originally intended as a competitor to Paris Match. History and profile Jours de France was established in 1958. The magazine was used as a tool by Dassault to propagate his political ideas and vision, such as organizing a World Fair in Paris (which did not happen). It was sent for free to all French dentists and physicians in France so that it was available to patients in the waiting rooms. It was essentially supported by publicity, which allow to keep a relatively low price. The magazine is headquartered in Paris.

Early life and education A native of Rock Island, Illinois, Parker earned a degree from Los Angeles City College. Professional career Parker worked as the news director and as a reporter for KFI-AM radio in Los Angeles from 1969 until 1972. He also worked as an anchor, investigative reporter and general assignment reporter at KNXT (now KCBS-TV) in Los Angeles, from 1977 until 1980. In January 1980, Parker joined WBBM-TV in Chicago as a weekend news anchor and weekday general assignment reporter. He remained at WBBM-TV until 1985, when he chose not to renew his contract in order to join his wife, Mary Nissenson, who was working as a reporter for WABC-TV in New York. Parker then joined WABC himself as a general assignment reporter, remaining in New York until late 1986, when he returned to WBBM-TV as a weekend anchor. In 1987, Nissenson returned to Chicago, taking a reporting and substitute anchor job at WBBM-TV. In 1992, Parker was demoted as weekend news anchor and was replaced by Jay Levine, and filled in as a news anchor where needed. However, the bulk of his job involved being one of WBBM's star reporters, including on the ill-fated non-tabloid 10 p.m. newscast anchored by Carol Marin that ran for nine months in 2000.

The track in the foreground is standard gauge track. The Western Australian Government Railways (usually abbreviated to WAGR) operated many unique steam, diesel and electric locomotive classes. Often suffering from lack of available funds the WAGR locomotive fleet often consisted of locomotives far older than their expected operational life. Only one electric locomotive was operated by the government during the WAGR years.  Early steam locomotives  The first WAGR locomotives were two 1875 2-6-0 tender engines, later classified as the M class, built in England in 1875 and shipped to WA by sea. They operated on the first government railway in Geraldton, some 450 km north of Perth.Geoffrey Higham, (2007). \\"Marble Bar to Mandurah - A History of Passenger Rail Services in Western Australia\\" Bassendean, W.A. Rail Heritage WA. The opening of the Fremantle to Guildford railway in 1881 saw the use of two 0-6-0T tank engines from the British Robert Stephenson and Co, numbered Numbers 1 and 2 and later classified as the C Class in 1885. The C class engines were later given small tenders to increase fuel storage. C1 was later renamed 'Katie' and is currently preserved at the Rail Transport Museum.Jeff Austin, \\"Locomotive C1 - Katie\\" in Geoffry Higham, (2006). \\"All Stations to Guildford - 125 years of the Fremantle to Guildford Railway\\", Rail Heritage WA, Bassendean, published in 2006 to mark the 125th anniversary of the opening of the Fremantle-Perth-Guildford railway in Western Australia The contractor responsible for the construction of the Fremantle- Guildford railway, John Robb, sold his locomotive to the WA government also in 1881, and it became Number 3. Number 3 became to prototype of the WAGR A class 2-6-0 tender locomotives. The A class locomotives were soon supplemented by the B class 4-6-0T tank engines which had twice the haulage capacity of the A class. During this time the WAGR had been greatly expanded over the Darling Scarp and into the large agricultural strip to the East, specifically to the centers of Chidlow, Northam and Toodyay (then Newcastle). With the beginning of WA gold rushes in 1888 the railways required massive expansion and in 1889 the WAGR received a larger version of the A class which had been used in the construction of the private Great Southern Railway in Albany, on the southern coast of Western Australia. The new locomotives were a vast improvement over previous types and became the WAGR G Class, of which a total of 72 were eventually ordered, becoming the railways' most numerous type for its entire history. The G class existed in two forms - the initial 2-6-0 configuration and a later 4-6-0 type with improved running stability. The G class was immensely successful on a wide range of duties, and although phased out of mainline workings in the early 20th century, it lingered until the very end of steam in WA, with two examples still working as shunters at Bunbury in August 1972.Steve McNicol, (1994). \\"W.A.G.R. Steam Locomotives in Preservation\\", Railmac Publications, Elizabeth, South Australia p13  Late 19th century  The steep 1 in 30 gradients over the Darling Scarp presented a major problem to the early railway system, so in 1893/94 the K class 2-8-4T tank engines were introduced for traffic on this Eastern Railway. The K class was the first class of locomotives designed new for the WAGR, and some were later ordered for use in South Africa. The K class was unfortunately too heavy for branch- line operations and was so restricted to main-line services. In 1896 two new classes were introduced to the WAGR, namely the N Class 4-4-4T suburban tank engines and the O Class 2-8-0T&T;, so classified for the presence of tenders and boiler-side fuel-storage bunkers. The N and O classes shared a standard boiler and cylinders which gave them compatibility. The N class was primarily used on suburban passenger and shunting duties - a role which it dominated for almost two decades. The O class was used initially on mainline goods services but was quickly relegated to branch line services where it served successfully. In the event further orders were placed until the class totaled fifty-six, with 10 being built locally at the Midland Railway Workshops. The R class 4-4-0s represented a radical departure from previous WAGR locomotive design. The engines featured the largest diameter wheels of any WAGR locomotive at 1.45m, which allows for higher speeds at reduced power. Given the nature of WA's railways, however, this was not beneficial and the class saw limited service in its intended role as express engines, but continued to serve in country areas (such as around Northam) for many years. The class numbered 24 and was withdrawn in the mid-1920s when replaced by much larger locomotives.  Early 20th century  The onset of the 20th century saw the introduction of many new locomotives to the W.A.G.R. Notable examples included the E and F class engines of 1902 which were near identical with the exception of their wheel arrangements. An additional variant of the E class was provided as the Ec class, built in the United States. The E class was used for passenger services and was accordingly given the larger diameter driving wheels in a 4-6-0 configuration, while the F class freight locomotives had a 4-8-0 arrangement, providing extra power at the expense of speed. The D class 4-6-4T suburban tank engines were likewise introduced in 1902 and replaced the N class engines in suburban operations. All three classes, with the exception of some individual locomotives, underwent the process of superheating in 1912 to become the Es, Fs and Ds classes respectively. Also in 1912 the M class garratt-type locomotives were introduced, representing the first use of this type of locomotive in full-size mainline operation. The class was well adapted to WAGR's light branchlines and tight-radius curves thanks to its articulation.  The Interwar Period  Suffering from the effects of both the First World War and the Great Depression, the WAGR introduced relatively few locomotive classes in the years between World War One and World War Two. The P class 4-6-2 pacific-type locomotives were introduced in 1924 and in 1938 an improved version, the Pr Class was constructed at the Midland workshops. 8 P class engines were converted to Pr class between 1941 and 1944 to alleviate war time stresses on the aged WAGR locomotive fleet, most of which dated back to the 19th century.Phillipa Rogers (1999) \\"Troops, Trains and Trades - The Wartime Role of the Railways of Western Australia, 1939-1945\\" Bassendean, W.A. Success Print, , pp6-7  Post Second World War  In the years following World War Two, the WAGR underwent a massive expansion and quickly introduced new services and many new locomotive classes. Dieselisation Mainline diesel locomotives arrived on the WAGR in 1953 with the introduction of the WAGR Y class and in 1954 with the X Class.

The libretto for the piece was written by Messiaen himself.. Composition and premiere Trois petites liturgies was commissioned by Denise Tual for the Concerts de la Pl√©iade in Paris and composed during World War II, between November 15, 1943, and March 15, 1944. Messiaen originally conceived the piece as a work for two pianos, as he had achieved success in that format previously with Visions de l'amen. The sung words evoke the presence of God in himself and in all things, as indicated by the title. According to Messiaen, each movement describes a different facet of God's presence: > The principal idea is that of the divine presence, with each section > dedicated to a different kind of presence. The first section, 'Antienne de > la conversation int√©rieure' ('Antiphon of the Interior Conversation') is > dedicated to the God who is present within us; the second section, 'Sequence > du verbe, cantique divin' ('Sequence of the Word, Divine Song') is dedicated > to the God who is present in Himself; and the third section, 'Psalmodie de > l‚Äôubiquit√© par amour' (Psalmody of the Ubiquity of Love) is inscribed to the > God who is present in all things. These inexpressible ideas are not > expressed but remain of the order of a dazzling display of color. The work was premiered during the Concerts de la Pl√©iade at the Ancien Conservatoire on April 21, 1945, by Ginette Martenot (ondes Martenot), Yvonne Loriod (piano), the Yvonne Gouvern√© Chorale, and the Orchestra of the Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire, under the direction of Roger D√©sormi√®re. The audience present at the premiere included such respected persons as Arthur Honegger, Georges Auric, Francis Poulenc, Henri Sauguet, Roland-Manuel, Andr√© Jolivet, Claude Delvincourt, Lazare L√©vy, Daniel-Lesur, Ir√®ne Joachim, Maurice Gendron, Jean Wiener, Georges Braque, Paul Eluard, Pierre Reverdy, Pierre Boulez, Serge Nigg, and Pierre Henry. Although the piece was well received by the public, the critics reacted more harshly. The work sparked a controversy which came to be known as \\"bataille des liturgies\\".Roger Nichols, Messiaen (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1975), p. 40. The two primary points of contention were \\"the quality and relevance of Messiaen's commentaries\\" and the use of \\"unusual sounds\\" for expressing religious themes.Andrew Shenton, \\"Olivier Messiaen: Trois Petites Liturgies de la Pr√©sence divine, Boston Symphony Orchestra Program Notes (Friday, November 28, and Saturday, November 29, 2008): 2‚Äì4. (archive from July 19, 2011, accessed July 26, 2014). Claude Rostand responded particularly vehemently at the premiere, describing the work as a \\"work of tinsel, false magnificence and pseudo-mysticism, this work with dirty nails and clammy hands, with bloated complexion and unhealthy flab, replete with noxious matter, looking about anxiously like an angel wearing lipstick.\\" Years later Rostand would write that the premiere agitated musical Paris in a frenzy, partly caused by the end of German Occupation, and never seen since the heyday of Stravinsky, with Messiaen \\"acclaimed and crucified at the same time\\". In spite of this, critical opinion now judges the work to be one of Messiaen's most accomplished yet undemanding, still rooted in tonality but foreshadowing his later experiments with birdsong, Hindu rhythms and plainchant.Nichols, p. 41 Movements #Antienne de la conversation int√©rieure (Antiphon of the Interior Conversation) #:A-B-A (ternary form) #S√©quence du verbe, cantique divin (Sequence of the Word, Divine Song) #:Strophic form with variations, refrains, and couplets alternating continuously #Psalmodie de l'ubiquit√© par amour (Psalmody of the Ubiquity of Love) #:A-B-A The piece lasts approximately thirty-five minutes.

It was the first of several movies produced by Lee Robinson in association with Chips Rafferty in the 1950s. Plot summary Kim Marsden inherits a cattle station near Alice Springs after the death of her father. Kim becomes convinced her father was murdered. She sends for a legendary local bushman called the Sundowner, who was one of her father's best friends. Adopting the name Ted Simpson, the Sundowner arrives at Kim's station with his Aboriginal offsider, Dancer. They are given work by the station manager, McLeod. The Sundowner and Dancer discover that cattle rustlers have been stealing stock. The realise the person behind the murder is Kim's neighbour, Stapleton, who is in league with the cattle rustlers and is romantically interested in Kim. The rustlers kidnap Sundowner but he uses telepathy to get Dancer to come to his rescue. Kim is united with her true love, McLeod.Mayer, Geoff. \\"The Phantom Stockman: Lee Robinson, Chips Rafferty and the Film Industry that Nobody Wanted\\".

Rafferty wanted to make a ¬£120,000 13-part series and film, The Green Opal, about immigration problems. Robinson wanted to make a thriller, Saturday to Monday which later became The Siege of Pinchgut. Both were stymied by a government rule at the time which prohibited invent in non-essential industry over ¬£10,000. The two men knew each other because Robinson wrote scripts for Rafferty's radio show, Chips: the Story of Outback. They decided to team up together and make a film that cost under ¬£10,000, with Robinson directing and Rafferty starring. They were joined by cinematographer George Heath and formed Platypus Productions. Said Rafferty at the time: > We nutted it out this way. What's the good of imitating English and American > pictures when we can get into places these foreign production units can't > reach for sandflies and skeeters? We'll pick locations and backgrounds the > world knows nothing about. We'll study them for dramatic values. But we're > not buying stories. The stories will just come out of our heads and still > leave enough wood to make chairs. Robinson later elaborated: > We said, \\"Let's forget what the Australian public thinks about, what they > might take to, because if you put an Australian tag on a film it was the > worst possible thing you could do.\\" You see we were on a third-rate level as > far as the public was concerned in comparison to imported films from > anywhere.

It was decided to make the film in the Northern Territory where Robinson had worked for a number of years. The film was originally known as Dewarra, Platypus then The Tribesman. =Casting= Charles Tingwell was meant to play a role but was unable to fit it in his schedule and was replaced by Guy Doleman. Seventeen-year-old Jeanette Elphick, 1952 model of the year, was cast in the lead. =Shooting= It was shot around Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia starting July 1952. Several days shooting were lost due to unexpected rain. Interiors were shot in Sydney. Robinson later recalled: > My experience with actors was limited. Chips on the other hand had by now > made quite a number of films and he was an impeccable technical actor.... > There were people in the picture of course who had never made a picture > before.

(The movie would later screen on US TV as Return of the Plainsman.\\"Other 39 -- No Title\\" Chicago Daily Tribune 21 July 1956: c6.)

The deal was done through Herb McIntyre who had supported a number of local films. =Foreign release= In the United States it was released as Return of the Plainsman whilst the working title was The Sundowner.

In other words, the description of the world as given by the laws of physics does not depend on our choice of coordinate systems. However, it is often useful to fix upon a particular coordinate system, in order to solve actual problems or make actual predictions. A coordinate condition selects such coordinate system(s). Indeterminacy in general relativity The Einstein field equations do not determine the metric uniquely, even if one knows what the metric tensor equals everywhere at an initial time. This situation is analogous to the failure of the Maxwell equations to determine the potentials uniquely. In both cases, the ambiguity can be removed by gauge fixing. Thus, coordinate conditions are a type of gauge condition.Salam, Abdus et al. Selected Papers of Abdus Salam, page 391 (World Scientific 1994). No coordinate condition is generally covariant, but many coordinate conditions are Lorentz covariant or rotationally covariant. Naively, one might think that coordinate conditions would take the form of equations for the evolution of the four coordinates, and indeed in some cases (e.g. the harmonic coordinate condition) they can be put in that form. However, it is more usual for them to appear as four additional equations (beyond the Einstein field equations) for the evolution of the metric tensor. The Einstein field equations alone do not fully determine the evolution of the metric relative to the coordinate system. It might seem that they would since there are ten equations to determine the ten components of the metric. However, due to the second Bianchi identity of the Riemann curvature tensor, the divergence of the Einstein tensor is zero which means that four of the ten equations are redundant, leaving four degrees of freedom which can be associated with the choice of the four coordinates. The same result can be derived from a Kramers-Moyal-van-Kampen expansion of the Master equation (using the Clebsch‚ÄìGordan coefficients for decomposing tensor products). Harmonic coordinates A particularly useful coordinate condition is the harmonic condition (also known as the \\"de Donder gauge\\"): :0 = \\\\Gamma^{\\\\alpha}_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} g^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} \\\\\\\\!. Here, gamma is a Christoffel symbol (also known as the \\"affine connection\\"), and the \\"g\\" with superscripts is the inverse of the metric tensor. This harmonic condition is frequently used by physicists when working with gravitational waves. This condition is also frequently used to derive the post-Newtonian approximation. Although the harmonic coordinate condition is not generally covariant, it is Lorentz covariant. This coordinate condition resolves the ambiguity of the metric tensor g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\\\\\! by providing four additional differential equations that the metric tensor must satisfy. Synchronous coordinates Another particularly useful coordinate condition is the synchronous condition: :g_{01} = g_{02} = g_{03} = 0 \\\\\\\\! and :g_{00} = -1 \\\\\\\\!. Synchronous coordinates are also known as Gaussian coordinates.Stephani, Hans and Stewart, John. General Relativity, page 20 (Cambridge University Press 1990). They are frequently used in cosmology. The synchronous coordinate condition is neither generally covariant nor Lorentz covariant. This coordinate condition resolves the ambiguity of the metric tensor g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\\\\\! by providing four algebraic equations that the metric tensor must satisfy. Other coordinates Many other coordinate conditions have been employed by physicists, though none as pervasively as those described above. Almost all coordinate conditions used by physicists, including the harmonic and synchronous coordinate conditions, would be satisfied by a metric tensor that equals the Minkowski tensor everywhere. (However, since the Riemann and hence the Ricci tensor for Minkowski coordinates is identically zero, the Einstein equations give zero energy/matter for Minkowski coordinates; so Minkowski coordinates cannot be an acceptable final answer.) Unlike the harmonic and synchronous coordinate conditions, some commonly used coordinate conditions may be either under- determinative or over-determinative. An example of an under-determinative condition is the algebraic statement that the determinant of the metric tensor is ‚àí1, which still leaves considerable gauge freedom.Pandey, S.N. ‚ÄúOn a Generalized Peres Space-Time,‚Äù Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics (1975) citing Moller, C. The Theory of Relativity (Clarendon Press 1972). This condition would have to be supplemented by other conditions in order to remove the ambiguity in the metric tensor. An example of an over-determinative condition is the algebraic statement that the difference between the metric tensor and the Minkowski tensor is simply a null four-vector times itself, which is known as a Kerr-Schild form of the metric.Chandrasekhar, S. The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes, page 302 (Oxford University Press, 1998). Generalizations of the Kerr-Schild conditions have been suggested; e.g. see Hildebrandt, Sergi. ‚ÄúKerr-Schild and Generalized Metric Motions,‚Äù page 22 (Arxiv.org 2002). This Kerr-Schild condition goes well beyond removing coordinate ambiguity, and thus also prescribes a type of physical space-time structure. The determinant of the metric tensor in a Kerr-Schild metric is negative one, which by itself is an under-determinative coordinate condition.Stephani, Hans et al. Exact Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations, page 485 (Cambridge University Press 2003). When choosing coordinate conditions, it is important to beware of illusions or artifacts that can be created by that choice. For example, the Schwarzschild metric may include an apparent singularity at a surface that is separate from the point-source, but that singularity is merely an artifact of the choice of coordinate conditions, rather than arising from actual physical reality.Date, Ghanashyam. ‚ÄúLectures on Introduction to General Relativity‚Äù , page 26 (Institute of Mathematical Sciences 2005). If one is going to solve the Einstein field equations using approximate methods such as the post-Newtonian expansion, then one should try to choose a coordinate condition which will make the expansion converge as quickly as possible (or at least prevent it from diverging). Similarly, for numerical methods one needs to avoid caustics (coordinate singularities). Lorentz covariant coordinate conditions If one combines a coordinate condition which is Lorentz covariant, such as the harmonic coordinate condition mentioned above, with the Einstein field equations, then one gets a theory which is in some sense consistent with both special and general relativity. Among the simplest examples of such coordinate conditions are these: #g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta , \\\\gamma} \\\\eta^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = k \\\\, g_{\\\\mu u , \\\\alpha} \\\\eta^{\\\\mu u} \\\\,. #g^{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}{}_{, \\\\beta} = k \\\\, g^{\\\\mu u}{}_{, \\\\gamma} \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} \\\\eta^{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma} \\\\,. where one can fix the constant k to be any convenient value.

Qwirkle shares some characteristics with the games Rummikub and Scrabble. It is distributed in Canada by game and puzzle company, Outset Media. Qwirkle is considered by MindWare to be its most awarded game of all time. In 2011, Qwirkle won the Spiel des Jahres, widely considered the most prestigious award in the board and card game industry. A sequel, Qwirkle Cubes, was released by Mindware in 2009. Equipment Qwirkle comes with 108 wooden tiles, and each tile is painted with one of 6 shapes (clover, four-point star, eight-point star, square, circle and diamond) in one of 6 colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple). The box also contains a bag to store the tiles and a rule book. Play The game begins with all the tiles being placed in the bag and mixed thoroughly. Each player then randomly draws 6 tiles. During their turn, a player may either: * place one or several tiles on the table; or * instead of playing tiles, exchange one or more tiles in their hand for other random tiles. In general, any tiles that are placed in a row must share one attribute (either color or shape), and they must be played in one line, although they do not need to touch other tiles being placed in that turn. A player must always end a turn with 6 tiles, so, if they place tiles during a turn, they draw random tiles to build their hand back up to 6. Play continues until one person uses all of their available tiles and there are no more tiles to be drawn. Scoring Players score 1 point for each tile placed within a line, including existing tiles within the line. The idea is to form lines that have each shape of a certain color, or each color of a certain shape. For example: if there are 3 stars placed down on the grid (1 green, 1 blue, and 1 purple), then the player can put down another star that is red, orange or yellow. If a line is completed (this is called a \\"qwirkle\\"), then an additional 6 points is added to the player's score. At the end of the game, once there are no more tiles to be drawn to replenish one's hand, the first person to play all of their tiles gains an extra 6 point bonus, at which point the game ends, and the player who has the highest score wins.

Released theatrically on March 28, 1961, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. Plot Gabby Gator (voiced by Daws Butler), living in the Everglades, is suffering from utter starvation. Upon looking in the sky, he sees Woody Woodpecker happily flying overhead. Gabby takes out a shotgun and fires at the woodpecker and misses. Woody, however, sees Gabby's sign advertising the \\"Fryer's Club Hotel\\" and decides to satisfy his curiosity. The conniving alligator convinces Woody that his home is a luxury hotel, and sends the woodpecker up to \\"Room 350\\" (in truth, the temperature the oven is set at that Woody is bunking in). Woody begins to sweat profusely and requests \\"room service\\" by asking that ice be sent up. The ice manages to bring the stifling temperature down, eventually turning the oven off. Gabby then advises Woody that his hotel likes to tuck their guests in at night. In reality, Gabby puts Woody in a baking pan, and places dough on top of him. Woody catches on to this plan, and replaces the standard dough with Quick Rise Baking Powder. Unaware, Gabby bakes the pie, sending the rising dough high above his home, eventually splattering all over southern Florida. Notes The name \\"Fryer's Club Hotel\\" is a pun on the Friars Club of Beverly Hills, a private show business club started in 1947 by comedian/actor Milton Berle.

It was also known as the princedom of Onam. The area once included one of the best ports where the commercially important sandalwood was loaded on Dutch and Portuguese ships. Origins of the kingdom According to local legend, the ancestor of the royal line, Banu Naek, emerged from the sea together with his brothers Liurai and Sonbai. Liurai settled in South Belu and Sonbai in West Timor, and they were the ancestors of princely lineages in these regions. Banu Naek remained in Nokas and Nitibani near the south coast and was acknowledged as ruler by the locals. Since his belongings, and his own body, were golden (natun), his princedom was given the name Amanatun. The sonaf (residence) of the prince was situated in Nunkolo in the interior, which was inaccessible to enemies. At his side there was a lineage of Uis Pah (lords of the land) with various practical tasks, such as surveying land, defining borders, and deciding shares of the harvest. The Uis Pah stayed at Menu on the south coast, close to the port Boking where trading activities took place.Sejarah pemerintahan Kabupaten Timor Tengah Selatan (2003). Kupang: Undana, pp. 107-48. On lower levels of the traditional ruling system, there were fettors (district chiefs) and greater and smaller temukungs (settlement chiefs). Contacts with Europeans and Eurasians In European documentary sources the area first appears in the 16th century as Batumean, actually the name of a coastal village. The princedom of Batumean consisted of the more important Amanatun in the west, which subsequently gave its name to the entire domain, and Amanesi (Nenometan) to the east.P.A. Tiele (1886), Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel, Vol. I. The Hague: M. Nijhoff, p. 92. The sandalwood riches of Batumean soon attracted the Portuguese traders based on Solor and later Larantuka. After 1613 the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie or VOC) likewise competed for the wood. A third rival was the Indonesian kingdom of Makassar which devastated Batumean with a fleet in 1641. After this calamity Batumean approached the Portuguese Eurasians or Topasses in Larantuka and the princely family was baptized by the Dominican missionaries.A.B. de S√° (1958), Documentac√£o para a hist√≥ria das miss√µes do padroado portugu√™s de Oriente Insulindia, Vol. V. Lisboa: Agencia Geral do Ultramar, pp. 421-4. In spite of a brief anti-Portuguese resistance in 1655, Batumean stayed a vassal under the Topasses for the next century. The name Batumean disappeared by the end of the 17th century, and the domain was subsequently known just as Amanatun. The resources in sandalwood appears to have dwindled in this period, and the area was left much to itself. Under Dutch suzerainty After a major Topass defeat against the VOC forces of Kupang in 1749, large parts of West Timor submitted to Dutch suzerainty, including Amanatun. However, it was too distant from Kupang to be effectively monitored. It was only in the early 20th century that a real colonial rule was implemented. A Dutch column marched into Amanatun in 1906 as a part of a larger campaign of pacification of West Timor. A number of skirmishes with local chiefs took place in the years up to 1910. Some eastern parts of the princedom, Anas-Nenometan, which had previously been absorbed by the Wehali kingdom, were returned to Amanatun in 1910. By this time the princedom covered 917 square kilometers and had 15,300 inhabitants. The raja Muti Banu Naek was deposed in 1915 for his opposition against Dutch designs. His three successors governed as zelfbestuurders (rajas under colonial surveillance) until the definite departure of the Dutch in 1949. The last raja Lodeweyk Lourens Don Louis Banu Naek was in charge of Amanatun in the first years of Indonesian independence to 1962, when it was changed into a kecamatan (administrative district). It is now a part of the kabupaten (regency) Timor Tengah Selatan.Y.Y.K. Banunaek (2007), Raja Raja Amanatun yang berkuasa. Yogyakarta: Pustaka Pelajar, pp. 93-108.

In 1917, he was elected to honorary membership in the Alpha Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity at Boston's New England Conservatory. In 1919, he was elected to honorary membership in the Beta Chapter at Combs College of Music. In 1921, he was a member of the charter class of the Phi Chapter installed at the University of Wisconsin. The following year, in 1922, he was elected Supreme President of the Fraternity. Teacher's College, Columbia University (1924-1940) He served as professor and chair of the music education department, Teachers College, Columbia University, in New York from 1924 until his retirement in 1940, where he was a contemporary of educational reformer John Dewey. He used Dewey‚Äôs 1934 work Art As Experience as a text in his course on aesthetics. Retirement (1940-1951) He was Professor Emeritus from 1940 until his death in 1951. In 1946, he was guest conductor of the summer music camp at the University of the Pacific. Compositions Dykema wrote several songs, some of which appear in Sinfonia Songs. He wrote a choral anthem, We Who Love Music, and two Christmas songs, which appeared in the Blue Book of the Twice 55 series. They are To Shorten Winter's Sadness and A Carol for Everyman. Family Dykema was the ninth and youngest child of Cornelius and Henrietta Dykema, Dutch immigrants who met as teenagers and settled in Grand Rapids, Michigan after their marriage (Underwood, p. K.1). Dykema married Jessie Dunning on December 24, 1903. They had five children: Karl Washburn Dykema, Roger Dunning Dykema, Alice Mary Barnes, Helen Cargan Dengler, Peter Scot Dykema. His daughter Helen authored the biographical work Music For All in 1994, and was interviewed by Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity's T. Jervis Underwood for the fraternity's Centennial History. The Music Educators Journal After his 1913 speech at the national convention of what is now NAfME, Dykema quickly became an active member in the organization, and became an active member after his presidential term ended in 1917. He was perhaps best known for his position as the editor of the Conference journal, first called The Bulletin and renamed The Music Supervisors Journal in 1915. Dykema used the publication to keep members informed about the organization and the profession, writing frequent columns about such topics as community singing, musical tests, new movements in music education, and issues within the Conference. Advocacy Dykema organized choirs at all the schools where he worked, included arts in his classes, and promoted music education in his faculty positions at the university level. When he taught high school English, he included a unit on arts education, and he developed one of the first music appreciation courses in the country. During his tenure at Teachers College, Columbia University, he increased music education course requirements for the master's degree and helped develop the first doctoral program in the music education department. Dykema promoted music making and music education wherever he went. He was known as an inspiring choir leader and untiring worker, continuing to travel, write and lecture about music after he retired from his position at Teachers College in 1940. Heavily influenced by a Dutch Calvinist background that included family and church singing, Dykema advocated community music, believing that towns and cities should insure that their populations have access to musical groups, performance halls, and competent directors. He thought it was important that adults should have opportunities to study instruments as beginners, and he urged teachers to foster such a love of music that students would continue playing and singing after compulsory lessons had ended. In 1918, he chaired a joint committee of twelve (that included John Alden Carpenter, Frederick S. Converse, Wallace Goodrich, Hollis Dann, among others) that prepared the \\"service version\\" of the National Anthem. Later, as a member of the National Anthem Committee in 1942, he helped prepare The Code for the National Anthem of the United States of America (www.thenationalanthemproject.org/reprise.pdf). From 1923 to 1939, he served as chair of the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA)'s national Committee on Community Music. The reports of the committee as documented in MTNA's Volume of Proceedings from each year during that period contain in depth information on Dykema's efforts in the area of music advocacy: the promotion of Christmas carolling, community sings, music in industry, etc. He also described a collaboration between Phi Mu Alpha and Sigma Alpha Iota at the University of Wisconsin to establish a high school organization called Omicron Phi (MTNA Volume of Proceedings, 1936, p. 356). During much of this period, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia and MTNA held national conventions simultaneously. He was a member of a Manhattan chapter of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America (SPEBSQSA), now known as the Barbershop Harmony Society, along with fellow Sinfonians Sigmund Spaeth and Fiorello LaGuardia. Prescott Bush was also a member of the Manhattan chapter of SPEBSQUA (May 1946 Harmonizer). Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity Considered one of the most influential leaders in the Fraternity's history, Dykema was elected as an honorary member of the Fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston on or around January 8, 1917 while serving as president of what is now the Music Educators National Conference. Three years later, he was elected an honorary member of the Beta Chapter at the Combs College of Music in Philadelphia. He was a member of the class that chartered the Phi Chapter at the University of Wisconsin in 1921, and was elected as a national honorary member (Alpha Alpha Chapter) in 1932. Based on the records compiled by former supreme historian Thomas Larrimore, it appears that Dykema holds the record for the most multiple chapter memberships. Following a period of internal difficulty following the active departure of Ossian E. Mills, Percy Jewett Burrell, and other early Fraternity leaders, the Fraternity experienced internal difficulty (made more significant by the challenges of World War I) during the five years leading up to Dykema's election in 1922. Upon his election, Dykema addressed the delegates at the Chicago convention, \\"I want to hear from each one of you. The first thing I want to know is, 'Why should this fraternity exist at all? Why shouldn't we abandon the whole idea?\\" (Underwood, p. K.2). Dykema's words challenged and stirred his listeners, and the Fraternity's second defining period commenced. The number of active chapters grew significantly under his watch as president, and during those years the Fraternity was introduced to major universities such as Pennsylvania State University, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, the Eastman School of Music, the University of Illinois, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Arizona, and Columbia University. Dykema made several contributions to the Fraternity. He served on a team that oversaw the develop of membership intake protocol in 1926 and 1938. He served as editor and compiler of the 1931 edition of Sinfonia Songs. In the 1920s, he established the province structure, appointing the inaugural class of province governors. He was instrumental in bringing multiple key leaders in music education and advocacy into the fraternity, including Paul J. Weaver, Edward Bailey Birge, and Clarence C. Birchard. He presided over the dedication of the memorial in honor of Ossian E. Mills in Putnam, Connecticut in 1928, in addition to presiding over the dedication of the Sinfonia Lodge at Interlocken. As a faculty member at Teachers College of Columbia University, he maintained close involvement with the Beta Gamma Chapter, where he served on the faculty after leaving Wisconsin. Through his influence, many men associated with music education on the national level came into Fraternity membership. He served as supreme president from 1922 to 1928, during which time the Fraternity essentially doubled its number of active chapters across the country. Dykema's ascendancy to the presidency came just five years after his first election to honorary membership in the Fraternity. After leaving office as supreme president, he served as Committeeman-at-Large from 1928 to 1934, and as Supreme Historian from 1934 to 1938. His total years of formal service to the national level was sixteen years. During the remaining thirteen years of his life, he continued to be actively involved with the Fraternity. In 1944, he helped coordinate a Fraternity reception in New York City in honor of the Republican presidential candidate, and fellow Michigan graduate and Fraternity member, Thomas E. Dewey. He is credited with essentially saving the Fraternity from extinction through the administrative restructuring that took place under his leadership as president(which involved dividing the Fraternity into provinces and the appointment of province governors, one of the earliest of whom was Thomas E. Dewey. Through his involvement with the Music Teachers National Association and the National Association of Schools of Music, the Fraternity came into close collaboration with these organizations, which had a lasting influence on the Fraternity's focus on music advocacy for decades. Dykema served as chair of the 1931 edition of Sinfonia Songs. Some of the popular songs of a \\"general nature\\" entered the songbook under his watch. Several of his songs are included in the current songbook published in 1998, as are several that had previously appeared in the Twice 55 Community Songs series edited by Dykema. Two of his sons were also Sinfonians: Karl Washburn Dykema (into the Delta Eta Chapter at Youngstown State University in 1959), and Roger Dunning Dykema (into the Beta Gamma Chapter at Columbia University in 1928). Along with William B. McBride, Dykema is one of only two men who served as national president of both the Fraternity and the NAfME. The Fraternity commissioned an oil painting of Dykema. The painting is part of the Gottesman Libraries' collection at Columbia University. It was restored by Chelsea Restoration conservators during the summer of 2010. Death Dykema died from a heart attack at his home in Hastings, New York on Sunday, May 13, 1951. His funeral was held in St. Paul's Chapel (Columbia University) on the campus of Columbia University in New York City. The eulogy, written by former Sinfonia national president Norval Church, was delivered by Columbia's chaplain, James A. Pike. Dykema's ashes were scattered at Lake Ompah, his favorite wilderness retreat, in Ontario, Canada. Honors He was initiated as a member of Phi Mu Alpha's Alpha Alpha National Honorary Chapter in 1932, with the Beta Gamma Chapter conducting the ceremony. In 1986, he was recognized as a member of the National Association for Music Education's Music Educators Hall of Fame. References * Birge, Edward Bailey.

It aired from August 18, 2008, until December 22, 2008. The season was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California, with additional footage in New York City, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Italy; and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The executive producer was Liz Gateley. The Hills focuses on the lives of Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, Whitney Port, and Heidi Montag. During the season, Conrad's distaste for Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt continues to inhibit reconciliation between the women. Meanwhile, Patridge is concerned that her new housemate Lo Bosworth is straining her relationship with Conrad. The season finale saw Port relocate to New York City to accept employment with Diane von F√ºrstenberg, while Montag and Pratt elope. Upon the conclusion of the season, Port was commissioned her own spin-off series The City, which originally chronicled the lives of her and friends Olivia Palermo, Jay Lyon, Erin Lucas, and Adam Senn. Additionally, rumors were widespread that Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities, though she made her final appearance on the series during the mid-season finale of the following season. Synopsis The fourth season continues as tension builds between housemates Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, and Lo Bosworth. Patridge expresses concern that Bosworth is becoming a distancing factor between herself and Conrad. Before Patridge moves into a separate residence, the women tearfully mend their friendship. However, their friendship is briefly strained after Patridge hears false speculation that Conrad was involved with her on-again/off-again boyfriend Justin Brescia. Conrad became involved in a romantic relationship with her former boyfriend Doug Reinhardt, though the pair eventually separated and instead became friends. As part of her duties with Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution, Whitney Port finds herself often travelling to New York City and living a bi-coastal lifestyle. She eventually moves to the city after receiving employment with Diane von F√ºrstenberg, at which point she is commissioned her own spin-off series The City. Meanwhile, to the dismay of her boyfriend Spencer Pratt, Heidi Montag allows her sister Holly to temporarily live with them after moving from their hometown of Crested Butte, Colorado. Pratt eventually convinces Heidi to ask Holly to find another residence. In celebration of her absence, he visits Montag at her work event with Bolthouse Productions, where she is terminated after becoming visibly intoxicated. However, Pratt later becomes enraged after Conrad and Bosworth welcome Holly to stay with them, as he and Montag were still feuding with the former regarding earlier sex tape rumors. Afterwards, Pratt surprises Montag with a vacation to Cabo San Lucas, where they decide to elope. Upon returning to Los Angeles, Conrad and Montag appear to come to common terms and become friends again out of spite of suspicions over Spencer. The season concludes as Pratt chooses not to legalize their marriage after deciding to gift Montag with her dream wedding. Cast All four main cast members retain their positions during the fourth season of the series. Lauren Conrad serves as the series' narrator and focal point, and continues to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM). Along with her friend Whitney Port, she remains employed by Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. Audrina Patridge is housemates with Conrad, and works for Epic Records. Heidi Montag remains estranged with her former friends Conrad and Patridge, and is employed by event planning company Bolthouse Productions. The aforementioned women's storylines were largely developed by a number of supporting cast members. Lo Bosworth is Conrad's best friend and third housemate, though Patridge sees her as a distancing factor in her friendship with Conrad. Justin Brescia, nicknamed \\"Justin Bobby\\" by Bosworth, returns as Patridge's on-again/off-again boyfriend. Brody Jenner, Frankie Delgado, and Doug Reinhardt are mutual friends with the majority of the cast. Having dated during their teenage years, Reinhardt also briefly dated Conrad in the beginning of the season. Montag and her boyfriend Spencer Pratt are disliked by the majority of the cast, who look to disassociate themselves with the couple's antagonistic antics. However, Conrad is friends with their sisters Holly Montag and Stephanie Pratt, through whom Montag attempts to revive their friendship. In the workplace, Cutrone is featured as Conrad and Port's boss, while Brent Bolthouse serves as Montag's boss. Kimberly Brandon and Chiara Kramer are shown as Montag and Patridge's respective co-workers and friends.

The duo consisted of actresses ZaSu Pitts and Thelma Todd. The team changed members over the years, becoming Todd and Kelly, then Kelly and Kelton, followed by Kelly and Roberti, then finally coming full circle with Pitts and Kelly. History ZaSu Pitts Thelma Todd Patsy Kelly Roach had previously paired Anita Garvin and Marion Byron together in 1928 and 1929 but only three films resulted. Both Pitts and Todd had been working with Roach in various short films and feature films previously. The duo worked together for 17 short films. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy made a guest appearance in Pitts and Todd's 1931 short On the Loose. The 1930 Leroy Shield song \\"Beautiful Lady\\" was used as the theme song for the Pitts and Todd films. The team's 1932 short film Show Business was directed by Jules White and was later re-worked as a Three Stooges Columbia short A Pain in the Pullman from 1936. In mid-1933, ZaSu Pitts left the Hal Roach studios and Patsy Kelly was brought in as Thelma Todd's new partner. This team filmed 21 more short films together until Todd's death in 1935. The next pairing was Patsy Kelly and Pert Kelton for one short, and then Kelly and Lyda Roberti for two shorts and one feature film, Nobody's Baby. Roberti died in 1938 at age 31.

It was constructed between February 1935 and August 1936 to house the German Ministry of Aviation (Reichsluftfahrtministerium, or RLM), headed by Hermann G√∂ring, a leading Nazi. During the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) it was known as the Haus der Ministerien (\\"House of Ministries\\"). In 1992, it was named the Detlev Rohwedder Building, in honour of Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, the assassinated head of the Treuhand, which had its headquarters there 1991-1995\\\\. However, the building is more commonly known as the Air Ministry Building. Since 1999, the building has been the seat of the German Finance Ministry. Design and construction The Air Ministry Building, December 1938 Construction of the Air Ministry Building, 1935 The building was designed by Ernst Sagebiel, who rebuilt Tempelhof Airport on a similarly gigantic scale. One writer has described it as \\"in the typical style of National Socialist intimidation architecture.\\" It ran for more than along Wilhelmstra√üe, partly on the site of the former Prussian War Ministry dating from 1819, and covered the full length of the block between Prinz-Albrecht-Stra√üe and Leipziger Stra√üe, even running along Leipziger Stra√üe itself to join onto the Prussian House of Lords, today housing the Bundesrat. It comprised a reinforced concrete skeleton with an exterior facing of limestone and travertine (a form of marble). With its seven storeys and total floor area of , 2,800 rooms, of corridors, over 4,000 windows, 17 stairways, and with the stone coming from no fewer than 50 quarries, the vast building served the growing bureaucracy of the Luftwaffe, plus Germany's civil aviation authority which was also located there. Yet it took only 18 months to build, the army of labourers working double shifts and Sundays. The first 1,000 rooms were handed over in October 1935 after just eight months' construction. When completed, 4,000 bureaucrats and their secretaries were employed within its walls. =Post-WWII= The Air Ministry building was one of the few Nazi public buildings in central Berlin to escape serious damage during the Allied bombing offensive in 1944‚Äì45. After the war, the huge structure was quickly repaired, with only the Ehrensaal (Hall of Honour) being substantially altered. It was remodelled into the Stalinist neo- classicist Festsaal (Festival Hall), with the enormous Eagle and Swastika that had adorned its end wall being removed. Once the work was complete, the building was used by the Soviet military administration until 1948, and from 1947 until 1949 by the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which became the top administrative body in the Soviet Occupation Zone. At that time it became officially known as Haus der DWK (\\"House of the 'DWK'\\"). On 7 October 1949, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was founded in a ceremony in the Festsaal, with Wilhelm Pieck as President and Otto Grotewohl as Prime Minister (Ministerpr√§sident). Later the building served the Council of Ministers of the GDR and other affiliated organizations of the GDR, hence its new name Haus der Ministerien (House of the Ministries). The GDR-era Max Lingner mural Between 1950 and 1952 an extraordinary long mural, made out of Meissen porcelain tiles, was created at the north end along Leipziger Stra√üe, set back behind pillars. Created by the German painter and commercial artist Max Lingner together with 14 artisans, it depicts the Socialist ideal of contented East Germans facing a bright future as one big happy family. In fact the mural's creation was a somewhat messy affair. Commissioned by the Prime Minister, Otto Grotewohl, Lingner had had to revise it no fewer than five times, so that it ultimately bore little resemblance to the first draft. Originally based on family scenes, the final version had a more sinister look about it, a series of jovial set-pieces with an almost military undertone, people in marching poise and with fixed, uniform smiles on their faces. Lingner hated it (as well as Grotewohl's interference) and refused to look at it when going past. With a degree of irony, the building became the focal point a year later of the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany. Detail of the GDR-era Max Lingner mural =After reunification= From 1991‚Äì95, after German reunification, it housed the Treuhand (Trust Establishment), which privatised former enterprises operated by the East German government. Its first chairman, Detlev Rohwedder, was murdered by Red Army Faction terrorists on 1 April 1991, and on 16 January 1992, the building was renamed the Detlev Rohwedder House () in his honour. From 1990, the Berlin branch office of the German Finance Ministry was also located there, and since 1999, following extensive refurbishment, the building has served as the Ministry's headquarters. At the north (Leipziger Stra√üe) end of the building, a plaque commemorates the protest meeting of 16 June 1953, from which stemmed the following day's East German uprising of 1953. In 1993, the nearby 1950s Lingner mural was joined by another scene set into the ground nearby: a huge blown-up photograph of 1953 protesters shortly before their gathering was suppressed.

The band consists of frontman/lyricist Alex Martel (vocals) and main composer Antoine Lamothe (drums). Initially formed in 2004 by Martel, the band went through numerous lineup changes before teaming up with Lamothe in 2007. The band released the Infected EP in 2008. They started work on their first full-length album Petty in 2010, which was mixed by Vance Powell, mastered by Bob Ludwig and features Munky from Korn as guest guitarist on the songs Further and Help. Once the album was completed, Deadly Apples went on hiatus for seven years as Martel focused on the growth of his festival, Montebello Rockfest, and Lamothe focused on his career in the film industry. In 2017, the band reformed for their first live show in seven years supporting Rammstein in Canada and released several songs from the Petty album along with a music video for Further directed by Lamothe. In 2018, they toured for two months with Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie on the US Twins of Evil Tour. They also toured Japan with Korn and South America with Deftones, as well as several festivals such as Vans Warped Tour, Knotfest Mexico and Hell & Heaven Fest. The band is known for its very intense and energetic live performances. HistoryFormation: 2004-2006= Deadly Apples was formed in high school by Alex Martel in 2004 and had several lineup changes in the early stages of the project. In 2005, the band released a demo called Metamorphosis Has Begun. In 2005, Martel founded Montebello Rockfest to give the opportunity to Deadly Apples to perform at a festival. The event eventually went on to become Canada's largest rock festival and the band is credited for starting it. =Infected, Petty, hiatus: 2007-2011= In 2007, Martel teamed up with Antoine Lamothe to form the current version of Deadly Apples.

In 2009, the band premiered a stripped down electroacoustic set, opening for the cross-Canada tour of Blindoldfreak, solo project of Nine Inch Nails keyboard player Alessandro Cortini. Following that run, the band continued touring with both their usual and stripped down sets, performing at several festivals in Canada and the U.S., including large-scale festival stops with Korn at Rock On! Fest in New Hampshire and Heavy Mtl in Montreal. In 2010, Deadly Apples started work on the full-length album Petty, which was mixed by Vance Powell, mastered by Bob Ludwig and features Munky from Korn as guest guitarist on the songs Further and Help. Once the album was completed in 2011, Deadly Apples went on hiatus for seven years as Martel focused on the growth of his festival and Lamothe focused on his career in the film industry. In 2011, Paul Barker of Puscifer and formerly Ministry remixed the song Self Inflicted Oppression with samples from Ministry's Psalm 69.

Despite what its name may allude to, ampelographers have little evidence to believe that the grape originated in Tuscany or has any close genetic relationship with the notable Tuscan wine grape, Sangiovese, that is also known under the synonym of Uva Tosca. In 2010, DNA analysis suggested that Uva Tosca may be a natural crossing between the Alto-Adige wine grape Schiava Grossa and Crepallocchi.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 1105-1106 Allen Lane 2012 History Schiava Grossa/Trollinger (pictured) is one of the likely parents of Uva Tosca. Ampelographers believe that, despite its name, Uva Tosca originated in the Emilia-Romagna region where it was first described in 1644 by Italian agronomist Vincenzo Tanara. Tanara noted that the grape made pale- colored \\"reddish wine\\" that was very healthy to consume and somewhat sweet and spicy. Another item casting doubt on a potential Tuscan origin is the lack of a close genetic relationship with the notable Tuscan wine grape Sangiovese, of which it shares the synonym of Uva Tosca, with instead DNA profiling suggesting that the grape is a natural crossing of the Alto-Adige wine grape Schiava Grossa and Crepallocchi. Additional DNA studies also found that Uva Tosca may be one of the parent varieties of the Emilia-Romagna grape Lambrusco Monterico, one of the many varieties in the Lambrusco family that can be used to produce the wine of the same name. Viticulture Uva Tosca is a mid to late-ripening grape vine that is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of powdery mildew and millerandage. Uva Tosca seems to thrive at higher altitude plantings, being one of the few red Italian grape varieties that can fully ripen at elevations between to above sea levels. Wine regions The vast majority of plantings of Uva Tosca are in the Emilia-Romagna region. In 2000, there were of Uva Tosca planted in Italy, the vast majority of it in the provinces of Modena, Ravenna and Reggio Emilia. Historically, the grape was often planted at the higher elevation in the foothills of the Apennines where it was one of the few red wine grapes that could reliably ripen. But in the mid to late 20th century, plantings of Uva Tosca were brought down to the plains along the Secchia river valley and other tributaries in the Po Valley. While permitted in several Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) and Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT), the grape is rarely seen as a varietal and is mostly used a minor blending component.

The indigenous Assyrian people of ancient Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia had adopted Christianity in the 1st century AD, founding the Church of the East in Assyria and Osroene (see also: Assyria, Assyrian people and Assyrian continuity). Those who converted to the Pentecostal Church (as well as the Assyrian Evangelical Church) in the 20th century were initially all members of the Assyrian Church of the East or its later 18th century CE offshoot, the Chaldean Catholic Church, whilst others had been members of the Syriac Orthodox Church or Ancient Church of the East (a 20th-century offshoot of the Assyrian Church). The vast majority of modern- day ethnic Assyrians remain adherents of these ancient indigenous Eastern Rite churches. The current church's doctrine and tradition is a continuation of the spiritual revival movements that took place in Western Iran during the 1930s. In 1940, with great diligence and personal sacrifice a young Assyrian pastor, named Tooma Nasseri began his evangelical ministry throughout Western Iran and built churches and established congregations in villages, towns, and major metropolitan cities in Iran. With the seed of Protestant Christianity planted, the Assyrian Protestant churches began to emerge throughout greater Iran in the 1950s. Currently, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church has several congregations in California, Illinois, Canada, Australia, Austria, and Iran. The Church is an affiliate with the Assemblies of God. Today, the church may have from 12 to 20 thousand adherents. Name of the church The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, or the Jewish Feast of Weeks, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ (Esho Mshexa in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic) as described in the Book of Acts, Chapter . Thus, the Church's name originates from the biblical passages contained within the Acts of the Apostles which refers to the day of Pentecost.

Colloquially the Burkenroad-followed companies are referred to as \\"stocks under rocks\\". The reports are published by the Freeman School of Business at Tulane University. Under faculty supervision, students work in small groups to produce the reports after visiting companies and interviewing top management. This procedure gives students the opportunity to develop practical stock analysis skills. History Burkenroad reports was founded by Peter Ricchiuti in 1993. Since its founding, the reports have gained national attention for their \\"quality and for avoiding the conflicts inherent when analysts follow a company in which they have financial stake\\" (The Wall Street Journal, October, 1995). Over 40 company reports have been published since the project's inception. Twenty-one companies under Burkenroad coverage have been taken over since 1993. The Latin American expansion of the program began in 2001. Later in 2001, The Burkenroad Mutual Fund went live. There are hundreds of Burkenroad Reports Tulane alumni in the investment industry. These alumni are colloquially jokingly referred to as \\"Burkendorks,\\" in reference to their attention to detail and dedication to accurate reporting. Annual conference Burkenroad Reports has hosted public investment conferences in New Orleans. The Burkenroad annual conference gives an opportunity for individual and institutional investors to hear directly from top management of Burkenroad-covered companies. The event also provides a forum for students, alumni, and business managers to network with one another. Mutual fund The Hancock Horizon Burkenroad Mutual Fund (HHBUX, HYBUX and HIBUX), is managed by Horizon Advisors and is distributed by SEI Investments. The Burkenroad fund seeks capital appreciation by investing primarily in common stocks of companies with small capitalizations located or doing business in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The fund managers utilize a quantitative top down approach to picking stocks and use Tulane's Burkenroad Reports as a source of research and analysis when needed. Since inception (12/31/01) the fund has outperformed about 94% of domestic equity mutual funds and has significantly outpaced both the Russell 2000 and S&P; 500 indexes,https://news.tulane.edu/news-pr/mutual-fund-backed-tulane-student- research-ranked-among-best-nation although appropriate risk adjustments need to be made.

The Neo Art Deco design style was chosen by David M. SchwarzSchwarz Architects about the Smith Center to echo the design elements of the Hoover Dam, just 30 miles to the southeast. It also shares design features with the Will Rogers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas. The center features a 17-story carillon tower containing 47 bells and is the first performing arts center in the nation to be Gold LEED certified. It opened on March 10, 2012. The Smith Center features international music, and dance companies and is the home of the Las Vegas Philharmonic and Nevada Ballet Theatre. The Center is under the leadership of President and CEO Myron Martin.  History  The Smith Center construction site in March 2010 Prior to The Smith Center opening, Las Vegas was one of the largest cities in the country without a performing arts center. Some highly customized production shows and venues have long existed at various resorts on the Las Vegas Strip but none were geared towards the variety of performances that a stand-alone center would provide, such as that required for touring Broadway productions or major symphony orchestras. A smaller performing arts venue at the University of Nevada Las Vegas was inadequate for these purposes. Plans were initially conceived for a new center around 1994. The Donald W. Reynolds Foundation made a donation of $150 million in 2005, the second largest donation to performing arts in United States history. A car rental fee was also initiated by Clark County and the State of Nevada to repay bonds of $105 million. These two factors together moved the public-private project towards construction. The building was named after Fred and Mary Smith, the chairman of the Reynolds Foundation and his wife, as the largest benefactors. The City of Las Vegas began separate plans around 2000 to build a downtown urban district called Symphony Park, which was selected as the site for the Center. In 2010, it was announced that the Lied Discovery Children's Museum would move to the Smith Center, replacing an originally proposed 600-seat theater that was scrapped from the plans in 2008. The reasoning was that the city already had numerous similarly sized venues in the various hotel resorts. A partnership with the Kennedy Center and some classrooms onsite provide educational opportunities for local youth. The planners expect the center to foster arts awareness and help to revitalize the downtown area with the Center's opening in 2012.  Architecture and artworks  View towards the tower featuring Neo Art Deco design The Smith Center Board wanted a timeless and elegant design, selecting architect David M. Schwarz to design the center, using inspiration from the Hoover Dam's Art Deco style as a major and lasting historical influence in the Las Vegas area. The building is a reinterpretation of Bertram Goodhue's 1922 design for the Nebraska State Capitol at Lincoln, and John & Donald Parkinson's 1929 Bullocks Wilshire in Los Angeles. White Indiana limestone for the facade (as at Lincoln), as well as numerous detail elements based on the Hoover Dam and 1920s motifs feature throughout the facility, including a winged sculpture in the Center lobby modeled after the dam's famous Winged Figures of the Republic statues. A prominent flower theme was also added in select places since Mary Smith's favorite flower is the Blue Iris. In addition, artwork by local artists from the Las Vegas Art Museum have been loaned to the center to be displayed. A large concert hall and two smaller theaters were designed as the main venues. At the corner is a 17-story tower featuring 47 bells and providing a new focal point for the downtown skyline, as well as the Center. Audio design firm Akustiks worked with Schwarz to ensure optimum sound quality in all the venues, installing high tech sound enhancing features like retractable drapery and auto closing doors to reflect or absorb sounds based on the performance type. The main hall is also double soundproofed against outside noises. An outdoor park plaza was also built, serving as an additional outdoor concert venue if needed. It features an artwork by Tim Bavington, representing Aaron Copland‚Äôs \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\".  Entertainment venues  The main stage inside Reynolds Hall. The three main venues at the Smith Center are the Reynolds Hall, Myron's Cabaret Jazz , and the Troesh Studio Theater, the first of which is located in its namesake building and the latter two in the Boman Pavilion. *2,050-seat Reynolds Hall is designed to keep the seats close to the stage, seating is on 5 levels *240-seat Myron's Cabaret Jazz is designed for more intimate performances . *250-seat Troesh Studio Theater rehearsal theater * The Donald W.

History It was established in 1910, is a Chicago dance company located in downtown Chicago. Chicago Grand Opera Company's first ballet master was Luigi Albertieri (prot√©g√© of Enrico Cecchetti). The opera became a base from which successful Chicago resident dance companies emerged. In 1922 two √©migr√© dancers, Andreas Pavley and Serge Oukrainsky, among the opera's most illustrious early ballet masters, created Chicago's first independent ballet company, the Pavley-Oukrainsky Ballet, which toured nationally and internationally until Pavley died in 1931. In 1919, Adolph Bolm was invited by the opera to stage an original ballet. Based on a story by Oscar Wilde, Bolm's \\"The Birthday of the Infanta\\" had music by Chicago composer John Alden Carpenter and decor by the American designer Robert Edmond Jones. Midwest dancer Ruth Page initially starred as the infanta. In a later presentation of this ballet a young Chicago ballerina, Betty Felsen, starred as the Infanta. Born in 1905, Betty became a principle dancer before she was twenty years old. When Pavley and Oukrainsky left the opera in 1922 to form their company, Betty joined their new company and Bolm became the Chicago Opera's ballet master. Subsequently he helped establish Chicago's Allied Arts, considered the first ballet theater in the United States, which he directed from 1924 to 1927. Allied Arts ceased for lack of funds, but the Adolph Bolm Ballet continued. Experimentation continued in the 1930s and included a pioneering attempt by Mark Turbyfill (Chicago Opera) and his former student Katherine Dunham to organize an African American ballet company in Chicago. In 1933, Ruth Page choreographed \\"La Guiablesse\\", which featured Page along with Dunham and an all-black supporting cast. Dunham, Ruth Page and Bentley Stone formed the Chicago Works Progress Administration (WPA) Dance Project and had significant success. Two important ballets emerged by Page and Stone; \\"American Patterns\\" (1937), the first feminist ballet, and the landmark \\"Frankie & Johnnie\\". Following the WPA, The Page-Stone Ballet was the first American ballet company to tour South America. Ruth Page became the leading force of ballet in Chicago, establishing many Chicago companies with various names: Chicago Grand Opera Company, Ravinia Opera Festival, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, Chicago Opera Ballet, Ruth Page's International Ballet and Chicago Ballet, with Ben Stevenson and Larry Long as Co-Artistic directors in 1974. Chicago Ballet was well known for Page's version of \\"The Nutcracker\\", considered one of the finest, at Chicago's Arie Crown Theater in McCormick Place. It premiered in 1965 and continued until 1997. Many international ballet stars appeared with the company during the long \\"Nutcracker\\" seasons. Historical Notes *The San Francisco Ballet is often called the first ballet company in America, probably because when it was established it never changed its name. San Francisco Ballet was founded in 1933 as part of San Francisco Opera, while Chicago Ballet (with various names) was established in 1910 as part of Chicago Grand Opera Company.

In addition to the bass and drum rhythm section, Henry Vestine supplied a \\"light electric rhythm guitar\\" and multi-instrumentalist Jim Horn reproduced Thomas' quill parts on the flute.The flute in the album version and single version differ slightly; in one version, the third note is held for only a moment, while in the other, it is held for two or three seconds. Although linked to the counterculture of the 1960s' back-to-the-land movement, Wilson's lyrics are ambiguous: Releases and charts \\"Going Up the Country\\" was first released on Canned Heat's third album, Living the Blues, in October 1968. Liberty Records released the song as a single on November 22, 1968, which peaked at number 11 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on January 25, 1969. \\"Going Up the Country\\" was Canned Heat's highest charting single in the US.

Per popular belief, Changdev Maharaj achieved Bhuta Siddhi (control over the classical elements) based on his yogic powers and used these powers to perform various supernatural acts.. Even though Changdev Maharaj himself is believed to have had held godly status and followers, his current following is mostly amongst Varkaris due to his association with Dnyaneshwar and Muktabai. Present day remains Temples dedicated to Changdev are today mostly found in the state of Maharashtra. References to his yogic and Tantric acts can be found in various literate related to yogic and Tantric streams as well as Buddhist folklore. The word Changa itself means good, and is also the name of a particular Shiva Jyotirlinga and the deity Bhairava. In the present day, the village of Changdev 12 kilometers away from Muktainagar District Jalgaon which is located where River Purna joins river Tapi, where Changdev Maharaj is believed to have lived for 1,400 years, houses an old temple dedicated to him. It is believed that the temple is about 3,000 years old. It is currently an ASI protected monument. The present day Puntamba, a village along the banks of the Godavari River in Maharashtra, is believed to be the 14th and final resting place for Changdev Maharaj. The village has a mid-17th- century temple which houses the samadhi of Changdev Maharaj. Narayanpur, a village to the south of Pune at the foothills of Purandar fort is believed be the native village of Changdev. It is believed that this ancient village, referred to as Pur during the Yadava Dynasty's rule, was a prosperous town. At present, it houses a 700+ year-old Narayan temple. The temple, which is Hemadpanti style, has inscriptions on its wall which preach teachings of Changdev Maharaj. Even though not a temple by itself, the masonry wall used by Dnyaneshwar as a steed to visit Changdev (see below) is a sacred monument and is worshipped by the Varkaris visiting the holy city of Alandi. Dnyanadev and the flying wall Changdev is most commonly known today due to his popular first encounter with Dnyaneshwar, also known as Dnyanadev. As the story goes, when the four siblings of Nivritti ‚àí Dnyanadev, Sopandev, and Muktai ‚àí achieved glory, Changdev Maharaj wanted to test them, and hence sent them a blank note. When the siblings received this note, they laughed at the gesture and, on Nivritti‚Äôs asking, Dnyaneshwar wrote 65 verses which were the quintessence of Vedanta on it. When the paper reached Changdev Maharaj, he had difficulty understanding what was written, and decided to meet the siblings to show them his yogic powers in person. For this visit he chose to ride on back of a tiger, wielding a poisonous cobra as a whip. When the siblings, then sitting on a masonry wall, saw the procession of Changdev Maharaj and thousands of his devotees walking toward their house, they decided to break his pride by humiliating him. They patted on the wall and it rose up to fly in the air. This use of an inanimate wall as a vehicle amazed everyone present. Changdev realized the greatness of these children. He became one of their disciples and overcame his pride and ego. These verses sent by Dnyaneshwar later became known as Changdev Pasashti (Pasast means 65 in Marathi) and are one of the holy scriptures amongst followers of Dnyaneshwar. Muktai, the spiritual guide Muktai, the sister of Dnyaneshwar, is believed to be the spiritual guide of Changdev Maharaj. As the legend goes, once Muktai and her brothers were sitting in the ashram when Changdev happened to pass by. Muktai was of course fully clad, but she appeared to Changdev as unclad and at once he turned away. Muktai then told him that he was not perfect as he still had a complex of sex and shame, and did not see God in every being. These words of Muktai had great effect on him and he eradicated this weakness through intense sadhana. Changdev wished to make Dnyanadev his guru, but Dnyanadev said that Muktai was the right spiritual guru instead of himself. From this point on, Changdev took Muktai as his spiritual guide, and many references to Muktai can be found in the Abhangs that he wrote. Legends associated with Changdev Maharaj ** Changdev Baba followed the path of Non-Duality in the Nath-Panth order. He followed Lord Adinath (who is said to be an incarnation of Lord Para Shiva). ** Changdev Maharaj was a Mahayogi who lived in his mortal coil for 1400 years. He had complete knowledge of and control over all the five elements (water, air, fire, earth, and ether). ** By his yogic powers, he gathered light and formed a real Jyotirlinga which he worshiped as Jyotir Shiva. He was also an occultist and used to worship Mahabhairav in the Jyotir Shiva Linga manifested by him. ** By his yogic powers, he resurrected many dead people back to life.

Its lyrical contents often deal with love and passion. The Balwo genre was founded by Abdi Sinimo.  Origins  The Balwo genre was founded by Abdi Sinimo, a Somali of the Reer Nuur subclan of the Gadabuursi. The first Heelo (Which is considered a sub genre of Balwo) was brought fourth by Abdi Sinimo as well. In 1945, while working as a lorry driver for the Djiboutian Port Authority, Abdi Sinimo was driving his truck and had experienced misfortune when around the Zeila area, thus the first Balwo was created. He called it \\"Balwo\\" (meaning misfortune in Somali), because of the remoteness of where his truck had experienced difficulty. The Balwo is a simple love lyric that has revolutionized modern Somali music. Another artist who made significant contributions to the genre was Abdullahi Qarshe, who is credited with the introduction of the kaban (oud) as an accompaniment to Somali music. In an interview with Abdullahi Qarshe, he affirmed that \\"modern music was in the air at the time of Abdi Sinimo, who is widely regarded as the genius who formulated and organized it into the belwo and thus took well deserved credit and honor for it.\\"  History  Abdi Deeqsi ( Abdi SInimo) was born in a place in the Borama area named Jarahorato, where he spent most of his youth. Unlike the overwhelming majority of Somali poets, his family were never rural nomad in the Somali bush, living in the traditional manner; Abdi Deqsi and his family was urbanized from the beginning. Early in youth, he went to Djibouti (At the time was known as French Somaliland) where he studied about vehicle mechanics as an apprentice. After returning to Borama around 1941, he was employed as a lorry driver mechanic by a wealthy merchant, by the name of Haji Hirsi. By now, Abdi had passed his thirtieth birthday and had acquired the nickname Sinimo (Cinema in Somali). Abdi was a well known orator of stories and jokes because of his passion to deliver the story, the nickname fit him extremely well. His outgoing personality made him very popular, especially among the youth. Abdi's trade route took him from Zeila, to Djibouti to Borama and Hargeysa and sometimes even as far away as Dire Dhabe in Ethiopia. One day, sometime between 1943 and 1945, his lorry broke down in the bush. Somali oral tradition debates the whereabouts of this happening. Some say it occurred in a place called Habaas; others say in Ban Balcad; while still others claim the place was Selel on the plain of Geryaad, thirty miles south of Zeila. Abdi was unable to determine what was wrong with his vehicle and was thus unable to repair it. Finally after much frustrating work and failed repair, he sat down and (as the Somali poet Hasan Sheekh Muumin states) these words escaped from his mouth: \\"Belwooy, belwooy, hooy belwooy....Waha i baleeyay mooyaane. Belwooy, belwooy, hooy belwooy!\\" (I am unaware of what caused me to suffer) The following variation is also sometimes quoted as the first Balwo by some Somalis: \\"Balwooy, hooy balwooy, Waha ii balweeyay mooyaane, Waha i balweeyay baabuure, Balwooy, hoy balwooy !\\" ( I am unaware of what caused me to suffer; What caused me to suffer was a lorry.) When Abdi returned to Borama after having his lorry towed back to Zeila, he recited his short poem in public. It was an immediate success which inspired him to compose other Balwo. Other poets also began to compose in the new genre, and it began to spread rapidly. Below is a sample from a poem by Abdi Sinimo .  Controversy  Balwo was becoming increasing popular, with members of the upper class in northern Somali towns hosting Balwo listening parties. This rapid expansion of the Balwo genre, after its establishment, caused many members of Somali religious orders to speak out against it. Religious leaders such as Shaykh Abdullah Mijlrtain and Muhammad Hassan, started to compose poems against the spread of Balwo. Their position was, the singing of love poems of the Somali Balwo genre is offensive to Muslim morality and decorum, and is against Islamic morals. Nonetheless ,the spread of the genre did not stop, Abdi established a troop and performed the genre in many cities in Somalia, thus becoming a modern Somali music innovator.  Influence on Somali Music  Balwo, was the immediate predecessor of the Heello, and thus Heelo become a sub genre of Balwo. Abdi's innovation and passion for music revolutionized Somali music forever.

It was founded by Ashkenazi Jews who had moved to Queens from Manhattan's Lower East Side. Est√©e Lauder and her parents were early members. The congregation constructed its synagogue building in 1911, a wooden Gothic and Moorish revival structure designed by Crescent L. Varrone, and modeled after the narrow tenement synagogues built on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The walls were later stuccoed. Neighborhood demographics changed, and most Jews moved away starting in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the remaining congregation was aged, and had difficulty paying for synagogue repairs and finding enough men for a prayer quorum. Bukharan Jews began moving to Corona in the 1990s, and in the mid-1990s began worshiping in Tifereth Israel's basement. Disputes between the old congregation and the Bukharan Jews and their new rabbi came to a head in 1997. Lawsuits in rabbinical and state courts led to the Bukharan congregation taking over the synagogue. The building deteriorated, and by 2008 was in need of $1.4 million in exterior repairs alone. , the New York Landmarks Conservancy had begun $1.5 million in restoration work. Tifereth Israel's building was the oldest structure built as a synagogue in Queens, and the oldest synagogue building in Queens continuously used for worship. Early history The congregation was founded in 1906 or 1907 as \\"Congregation Independent Chevra Tyfers Israel Anshei Corona\\" to accommodate Ashkenazi Jews who had moved to Queens from Manhattan's Lower East Side. It was known informally as the \\"Home Street Synagogue\\", after the original name of the street on which it is located. At the time, most synagogues used the word \\"Anshei\\" (Hebrew for \\"people of\\") in their names to designate the city or region in Europe from which their members originated. Tifereth Israel, however, used the term \\"Anshei Corona\\" to indicate that it was their new neighborhood of Corona, Queens that united the synagogue members. The Articles of Incorporation stated that the congregation's intent was \\"[t]o have a synagogue for the purposes of praying, to bury their dead, and to advance its members spiritually and intellectually.\\" When the synagogue was founded, approximately 20,000 of New York City's 1.5 million Jews lived in Queens, and Corona had two Jewish neighborhoods. Est√©e Lauder (n√©e Josephine Esther Mentzer) and her parents were early members; her parents owned a hardware store two blocks from the synagogue. In 1911, the congregation constructed a synagogue building on a lot at the corner of 54th Avenue. It was modeled after the synagogues built on Manhattan's Lower East Side, which had to be squeezed into narrow tenement lots. The two-story building, designed by Crescent L. Varrone, was wood framed, and \\"combined Gothic and Moorish design with Judaic ornament: pointed- arched windows, a roundel with a Star of David in colored glass, and a gabled parapet\\". The stoop, railing and clapboard siding were originally wood; the porch was later redone in brick with an iron railing, and the siding was covered with stucco. The facade was tripartite, consisting of a large central entrance-way and two smaller flanking towers. The basement was used for classes, including Hebrew lessons for Bar Mitzvah boys. A later addition on the same lot was a mikveh (ritual bath). The porch was later redone in brick with an iron railing, and the siding was covered with stucco. The latter, however, created problems; the stucco retained moisture, damaging the underlying wood. Yeshiva At one time the congregation opened an associated yeshiva on 53rd Avenue. It closed in the 1970s, and was converted into a music studio and residence. The American entertainer Madonna lived there in 1979 and 1980. Changing demographics Corona's Orthodox community once had four synagogues. The demographics of the neighborhood changed over the decades, with successive immigrant waves first of Italians in the 1930s and 40s, then Hispanics, then blacks. Most Jews moved to Long Island in the 1970s. While Tifereth Israel still had a large membership in the 1960s, it subsequently dwindled, and by the 1990s the synagogue building had deteriorated and was mostly unused. Along with a bakery, it was one of two original Jewish institutions left in Corona. By 1997, the congregation had little money, and difficulty both paying for necessary repairs, and getting the ten men required for a minyan. Bukharan Jews started moving to Corona in the 1990s. Five Bukharan Jewish families moved to LeFrak City in 1991; this number had grown to over 500 by 1995, and nearby apartment buildings held hundreds more. Bukharan Jews began worshiping at Tifereth Israel in the mid-1990s, holding their own services in the synagogue basement. Despite the fact that Tifereth Israel was an Ashkenazi synagogue, and the Bukharan Jews followed Sephardic law and customs, the groups initially co-existed peacefully. Conflict arose, however, in the spring of 1997, after Amnun Khaimov arrived as the Bukharans' rabbi. According to then-synagogue-president, 82-year-old Benjamin Fried, \\"They came and wanted to take the place over\\". Tifereth Israel's members wanted the Bukharans to help pay for the synagogue's upkeep, but Khaimov said that Bukharans were poor and could not afford to do so. Irwin Goldstein, who in 1997 had been Tifereth Israel's cantor for eight years, felt that \\"the rabbi's overwhelming presence, and followers, threaten[ed] to drown what remain[ed] of the Ashkenazic tradition at the synagogue\\". They believed that the Bukharans were hoping to start praying in the main sanctuary, relegating Tifereth Israel's members to the basement. Questions were also raised about Khaimov himself; all agreed he was qualified as a ritual slaughterer, but some doubted his rabbinic credentials. Yitzchak Yehoshua, the Chief Rabbi of the Bukharan Rabbinical Council of America, stated \\"I think he is a good butcher maybe, but he is no rabbi\\". Fried began giving them access to the synagogue only on Shabbat and the Jewish holidays, and locking them out otherwise. In response, Violet Milne, a synagogue member and Holocaust survivor, filed lawsuits in the Greater Queens Rabbinical Court and the State Supreme Court on behalf of the Bukharans. The Rabbinical Court ruled that the synagogue had to remain open to all worshipers, and any available money must be used for repairs; on September 24, the State Supreme Court upheld that ruling. Khaimov and his congregation took over the synagogue. Building deterioration and renovation The Sacred Sites program of the New York Landmarks Conservancy began working with the synagogue in 1999. It granted Tifereth Israel $4,700 to conduct an exterior and interior survey, and $10,000 in 2002 for exterior repairs. Though its appearance had changed considerably since it was constructed in 1911, according to Sacred Sites director Ann Friedman, the building was \\"a time capsule that is beautifully intact and in an unexpected place where there is new construction and housing all around\\". She stated that the Conservancy has also \\"paired the synagogue with a hotel developer who had been instrumental in restoring several upper West Side synagogues, and he just sent them $5,000 for their roof.\\" The Queens Historical Society labeled it a \\"Queensmark\\" in 1999, and the synagogue building and rabbi's residence were added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 2002, the first synagogue in Queens to be listed. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated it as a city landmark in February 2008. One of two synagogues left in Corona, its interior was \\"substantially intact\\", and a number of its \\"distinctive architectural features\\" remained, \\"including its original windows, decorative wood ornament, and Moorish pressed metal details\\". By this time, however, the building had further deteriorated; it had termites, it leaked, the paint was peeling, and in January 2008 the basement ceiling collapsed. Friedman estimated exterior repairs alone would cost $1.4 million. The congregation had been allocated over $1 million by both New York City and New York State, including $700,000 capital funding from the Borough President's Office, and a $200,000 matching State grant. Legal issues impeded its ability to collect them, because it was a privately owned, religious non- profit organization. At the time, the rabbi's wife estimated that the congregation had 50 member families. In 2010, according to the Conservancy, it had provided the synagogue with \\"$30,000 in direct grants and an additional $100,000 in pass-through funding\\". Funding had also been secured from the \\"State Environmental Protection Fund, The New York Community Trust and the families of Ronald and Leonard Lauder\\". It described the building as a \\"rare survival\\" of New York's wooden, vernacular synagogue architecture, A $275,000 gift from philanthropist Arnold Goldstein enabled the commencement of $1.5 million in restoration work. The Conservancy stated the restoration would \\"remove the present stucco coating and restore the original wood clapboard siding, wood windows and doors, Moorish-style metal domes and finials, and historic paint colors to this important building, returning it to its appearance of a century ago\\". Tifereth Israel's building is the oldest structure built as a synagogue in Queens, and it is the oldest synagogue building in Queens continuously used for worship. In 2020, the New York Landmarks Conservancy awarded the synagogue a $10,000 Sacred Site Grant for weather proofing the facility.

Background  Li Fan was born in 754, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong.Old Book of Tang, vol. 148. His family was part of the prominent Li clan of Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) ‚Äî not part of the same clan as the Tang dynasty's imperial Li clan, but which is considered one of the five most prominent Han clans of Northern Wei.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 140. It traces its ancestry to the prominent Warring States period State of Zhao general Li Mu whilst the line includes officials of the Qin dynasty, the Han dynasty, Cao Wei (a country of the Three Kingdoms period), the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420), the Former Yan or Later Yan, the Northern Wei, the Northern Qi, the Sui dynasty, and the Tang dynasty.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. Li Fan's great-grandfather Li Zhiyuan (ÊùéËá≥ÈÅ†) served as a deputy minister and prefect during the reign of Wu Zetian (r.690-705), whilst his grandfather Li She (ÊùéÁï¨) served as a supervisorial official at the Ministry of Rites during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Both Li Zhiyuan and Li She were known for their virtuosity.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  ;Young and first fame Li Fan's father Li Cheng (ÊùéÊâø) served as a circuit governor during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong.Old Book of Tang, vol. 115. Li Fan himself was said to be quiet, careful, attentive to his appearance, and studious in his youth. When Li Cheng died in 783, he left Li Fan substantial wealth. When relatives arrived to mourn Li Cheng, he allowed to take things as they wished, and thereafter continued to be charitable with the wealth; within several years, the wealth that Li Cheng left was spent, and the household was poor. When Li Fan was in his 40s, he was not yet serving as an official, and he was studying at Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). He did not even have enough money for his household's use. He was much resented by his wife as a result, but he did not mind this. When Du Ya (Êùú‰∫û) served as the defender of the eastern capital Luoyang,As Du Ya served at Luoyang from 788 to when he was replaced by Dong Jin ‚Äî i.e., 793 ‚Äî Li Fan's service under him must have been during that period. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 146 [Du's biography] and 145 [Dong's biography]. as he had been friendly with Li Cheng, he invited Li Fan to serve as a secretary under him. While Li Fan served under Du, there was an occasion when there was a major robbery at Luoyang. False accusations were laid against Du's officer Linghu Yun (‰ª§ÁãêÈÅã), and Du believed the accusations, tortured Linghu, and extracted a confession. Li Fan knew that Linghu was innocent and argued on his behalf; when his arguments were rejected, he resigned. When the real robber, Song Jutan (ÂÆãÁûøÊõá), was eventually captured, Li Fan became famous. ;Zhang succession crisis, consenquencies, and minor issues Later, Zhang Jianfeng the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xusihao Circuit (ÂæêÊ≥óÊø†, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) invited Li to serve on his staff. In or before 800, when Zhang grew ill, one of his subordinates, Du Jian (ÊùúÂÖº) the prefect of one of Xusihao's prefectures, Hao Prefecture (Êø†Â∑û, in modern Chuzhou, Anhui), was plotting to succeed Zhang, and therefore, without Zhang's orders, arrived at Xusihao's capital Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û). Li rebuked him and stated that if Du did not return to Hao Prefecture immediately, he would report this to the imperial government; Du, in fear, did so. When Zhang died in spring 800, the imperial government initially was set to commission Wei Xiaqing (ÈüãÂ§èÂçø) to succeed him, but the Xu Prefecture forces rebelled and supported Zhang's son Zhang Yin (ÂºµÊÑî) as his successor. After forces commanded by Du You the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered at Yang Prefecture) and Zhang Pi (Âºµ‰ºæ) the prefect of Si Prefecture (Ê≥óÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu) were both defeated by Xu Prefecture troops, the imperial government capitulated and allowed Zhang Yin to become military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Xu Prefecture but took the other two prefectures and merged them into Huainan Circuit. Thereafter, Li left Xu Prefecture and returned to Yang Prefecture. Du Jian, angry at how he felt Li took away his chance to control Xusihao, submitted an accusation to Emperor Dezong accusing Li Fan of having encouraged the rebellion of the Xu Prefecture troops. Emperor Dezong, in anger, issued an edict to Du You ordering him to execute Li. Du You, however, did not have the heart to do so. He showed the edict to Li, who indicated that he did not fear death. Du You, however, submitted a petition defending Li. Emperor Dezong, still not believing Li's faithfulness, summoned him to the capital Chang'an to meet him personally. After meeting Li, due to Li's relaxed attitude and elegance, concluded that Li was not guilty of treason, made him Mishu Lang (ÁßòÊõ∏ÈÉé), an official at the Palace Library.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. At that time, the official Wang Chun (ÁéãÁ¥î) was powerful, and he tried to invite Li to a meeting, intending to promote Li if Li showed submission, but Li refused to meet him. Meanwhile, Li's fellow junior officials Wang Zhongshu (Áéã‰ª≤Ëàí), Wei Chengji (ÈüãÊàêÂ≠£), and L√º Dong (ÂëÇÊ¥û) were then having many associates and often met to drink. They knew of Li's reputation and invited him to join them. He joined them once but, disliking how they gamed and used frivolous language, refused to join them again. Li later became Zhuke Yuanwailang (‰∏ªÂÆ¢Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu), and yet later became Yousi Yuanwailang (Âè≥Âè∏Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official under one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng).  During Emperor Shunzong's reign  In 805, Emperor Dezong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shunzong. When Emperor Shunzong, in turn, created his son Li Chun crown prince. While Li Chun was not yet emperor, Wang Chun nevertheless changed his name to Wang Shao (ÁéãÁ¥π) to observe naming taboo, and the popular sentiment at the time believed that it was inappropriate for him to have done so ‚Äî as Li Chun was not emperor. Li Fan, however, opined, \\"Every dynasty in history was undermined by those officials who did not understand what is important. What Wang Shao did was not unusual.\\"  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  ;Offices in the capital Later in 805, Emperor Shunzong, who was severely ill, passed the throne to Li Chun (as Emperor Xianzong). Li Fan was soon made Libu Yuanwailang (ÂêèÈÉ®Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low- level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu, note different tone than the ministry of rites), and then promoted to Libu Langzhong (ÂêèÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs. He was in charge of commissioning low-level officials, but on one occasion, he, after being misled by his messengers, was said to have made inappropriate commissions. He was thereafter demoted to be Zhuzuo Lang (Ëëó‰ΩúÈÉé), a supervisorial official at the archival bureau. He later was made the deputy principal of the imperial university (ÂúãÂ≠êÂæûÊ•≠, Guozi Congye), and then imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). As part of his duties, he reviewed drafts of imperial edicts. Whenever he saw what he believed to be improprieties in the edicts, he would write his comments on the yellow paper used for edict itself. When the officials in charge requested that, instead of doing so, he write on white paper and attach it to the draft edict, he responded, \\"Then I would be writing a petition, not correcting the edict.\\" The chancellor Pei Ji often recommended Li as having the abilities to be a chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. ;A frank Chancellor In 809, as Emperor Xianzong believed that Zheng Yin was too silent to be chancellor, he removed Zheng and made Li Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), and chancellor de facto with the title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). It was said that Li was open in his talks, hiding nothing from what he knew, and was much respected by Emperor Xianzong. Later in 809, based on the recommendations of Li and Pei, Emperor Xianzong entered into a peace treaty with Tufan. In 810, there was an occasion when Emperor Xianzong and the chancellors talked about gods and pondered whether they existed. Li, guessing that Emperor Xianzong was beginning to ponder whether to follow alchemists' suggestions to take various medications to seek immortality, pointed out that Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han both failed in their trying to achieve immortality, and that Emperor Xianzong's ancestor Emperor Taizong had fallen ill from such medicines. Li advised Emperor Xianzong to seek peace in the realm and refuse the alchemists' overtures, stating to Emperor Xianzong that he would achieve the lifespan of the mythical Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun if he did so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Li also advocated frugality. ;Opposition to regional governor's pretensions Also in 810, Wang E (ÁéãÈçî) was set to be commissioned as the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and wanted an honorary chancellor title, so he bribed many of Emperor Xianzong's close associates. Emperor Xianzong thus issued a secret edict to Li and fellow chancellor Quan Deyu ordering that Wang E be given the honorary chancellor title. Li drafted such an edict and then crossed out the words \\"and chancellor\\" in Wang's commission to show his opposition. Quan, who also opposed Wang's commission, was nevertheless dismayed and stated, \\"You can oppose it, but how is crossing out the words on the edict appropriate?\\" Li responded, \\"This is urgent. If the edict were issued, then it cannot be retracted. The sun is setting. How can we have enough time to oppose it?\\" After Li's and Quan's oppositions were heard by Emperor Xianzong, the matter of giving Wang the honorary chancellor title was dropped. ;Fall and death in honors Late in 810, Pei resigned on account of illness, and in spring 811, Li Jifu was made chancellor to replace Pei, over Li Fan's opposition.New Book of Tang, vol. 169. Li Jifu thus resented Li Fan. After he arrived at Chang'an, while meeting Emperor Xianzong, he argued that, during the time that Li Fan was chancellor and following the death of Wu Shaocheng, it was inappropriate that the warlord Wu Shaoyang was allowed to inherit the military governorship of Zhangyi Circuit (ÂΩ∞Áæ©, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan). It was said that Li Jifu's argument caused Emperor Xianzong to be displeased, and, several days later, Li Fan was removed as chancellor and made the head of the household of Emperor Xianzong's son and crown prince, Li Ning. Several months later, Emperor Xianzong began to miss Li Fan and summoned him to have discussions with him. In 811, Li Fan was made the prefect of Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), but before he could depart Chang'an, he died and was given posthumous honors. The popular comment at the time was that he was not as capable as Pei and not as stern as Wei Guanzhi, but that he was nevertheless admired for his integrity.

It led northwest out of Salt Lake City, Utah and north of the Great Salt Lake for about before rejoining the California trail near the City of Rocks, Idaho. From there Oregon Trail travelers could easily travel down the Raft River valley portion of the California Trail to return to the Oregon Trail. It provided a way to stop in Salt Lake City (the only significant city on the trail then) for repairs, fresh supplies, fresh livestock etc.. In later years it was used by tens of thousands of pioneers and miners going east and west on their way to or from the future states of California, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Nevada or Washington. See: NPS California Trail Map for routeSalt Lake city to City of Rocks Map Accessed 27 Apr 2010 History Samuel J. Hensley, returning to California in the summer of 1848, led a pack train of ten men on a quest to get back to the California Trail. After trying Hastings Route south of the Great Salt Lake and finding the salt flats too soft (heavy rains that year) for passage he returned to Salt Lake City and discovered a route, north of the Great Salt Lake. His newly blazed trail (cutoff) went from Salt Lake City back to the Oregon Trail and/or California Trail and joined the California-Oregon near the City of Rocks, Idaho-- about north of today's Utah- Idaho border. This became known as the Salt Lake Cutoff and was about the same distance as the Fort Hall, Snake River, Raft River, City of Rocks route which it bypassed. On the Humboldt River portion of the California Trail route, Hensley met and talked with a party of former Mormon Battalion personnel consisting of 45 men and one woman under Samuel Thompson driving wagons east on the California Trail to rejoin their families in Utah. On September 15, 1848 they found the junction of Hensley's pack trail near the rock formation called the Twin Sisters.The Salt lake Cutoff Thompson's group with wagons followed Hensley's pack trail back to Salt Lake City‚Äîconverting it into a passable wagon road. Thompson's company traveled southeast into northern Utah, crossing Deep Creek near present-day Snowville, Utah.The Plains Across: The Overland Emigrants and the Trans-Mississippi West 1840-1860; John D. Unruh; University of Illinois Press; pp 318-9; They found plentiful water and grass on the route just as Hensley had told them. With some difficulty they crossed the Malad River and the Bear River still traveling south east. They then went to the tiny community of Ogden, Utah where they crossed the Weber River before traveling on to Salt Lake City. Ebenezer Brown, leading a party from the 1846 Mormon ship Brooklyn, followed them three weeks later and helped to further define the trail. Word spread quickly that a good road with good grass and water was known out of Salt Lake City back to the California or Oregon Trail. When the gold-crazy emigrants of 1849 heard of this new route to the California gold fields, many thousands detoured to Salt Lake City to get new supplies and livestock. In Utah, ferries charging a few dollars per wagon were established at the Weber, Bear River and the Malad River in 1849 and later. An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 California or Oregon-bound immigrants a year passed through Salt Lake City between 1849 and 1852. Salt Lake Cutoff Thousands more followed every year before 1869 and the Transcontinental Railroad completion. ReferencesFurther reading  DeLafosse, Peter H.

In the biographies provided to the media, Riley acknowledges the early support of his parents, John and Mary Ann. While attending fourth grade in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, Riley began studying percussion privately with Thomas Sicola, Jr. (b. Mar. 1944), who, at that time, was a recent graduate of the New York College of Music (bachelor of music) and a music teacher in the nearby Cranford Township Public Schools. While studying with Sicola, Riley gained control of the snare drum through work on the rudiments (\\"beats of the day\\"), reading, and coordination -- both in the classical and jazz idioms. Sicola trained John on a variety of traditional percussion instruments, including xylophone, timpani, and drum kit. At age twelve, Riley began playing in rock bands and heard his first jazz recordings: (i) the soundtrack to The Gene Krupa Story and (ii) Max Roach's Conversation. Two years later, he played his first professional gig, which he obtained through an audition played over the telephone. Riley began studying with Joe Morello in 1971 after meeting him at a drum symposium. Riley graduated from Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School in 1971 and enrolled at the University of North Texas.\\"Scotch Plains-Fanwood High to induct 6 alumni into Hall of Fame\\", Suburban News, October 27, 2016.

Ralph Stanley won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his rendition of this song.

One of the articles is from folklorist Carl Lindahl, who researched claims from Western North Carolina that O Brother's \\"O, Death\\" is Chandler's composition. The article states that Chandler authored the song after a vision from God in 1916. Lindahl also chronicles his unsuccessful research in trying to find any trace of the song before Chandler's version, debunking previous claims that the song traces back to a 16th-century British composition.

Sells was known for his recently failed campaign to be Hamilton County Prosecutor, in which he had highlighted his success with convicting murderers and violent offenders. Neither Pender nor Hull testified at the trial. =Evidence against Pender= Citing the fact that Pender had bought the murder weapon on the morning of the murders and that she later helped Hull dispose of the bodies, Sells told the jury that she had planned the murders and had manipulated Hull into committing them. According to Indianapolis Star journalist Vic Ryckaert, Sells \\"likened her influence over Hull to the control Manson had over his followers, who committed a string of murders in 1969\\".Ryckaert, Vic Woman gets 110 years in 2 deaths The Indianapolis Star. August 23, 2002 The \\"female Charles Manson\\" tag has stuck to Pender ever since. To prove Pender's guilt, Sells relied chiefly on a letter allegedly sent to Hull by Pender in May 2001 and on the testimony of inmate Floyd Pennington. In the letter, Pender took responsibility for the murder. \\"I wish I could go back and change the events of that night\\", said the letter. \\"Drew was so mean that night. I just snapped. I didn't mean to kill them. It must have been the acid.[‚Ä¶] When you said you would try to take the blame, I knew then that you loved me deeply. At first I thought you would tell, but you stuck to your promise.\\" The letter ended with a postscript: \\"Destroy this.\\"Ryckaert, Vic Woman convicted of killing 2 roommates The Indianapolis Star, July 26, 2002 Forensic Document Examiner Lee Ann Harmless testified the letter had been written by Pender.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-WTL, Document 2, Page 6. Defense attorney James Nave contended the letter was a fake. He said that Sarah Pender was no \\"clever criminal mastermind\\" and that the murder \\"was not a cleverly planned criminal act. It was an act of the moment.\\" He argued that Richard Hull had shot Cataldi and Nordman because they were about to cut him out of a big drug deal.Ryckaert, Vic Woman convicted of killing 2 roommates The Indianapolis Star. July 26, 2002 Another piece of evidence presented to the jury was the testimony of fellow inmate Floyd Pennington, who had a pen relationship with Sarah Pender for several months. He testified that Pender had admitted her responsibility in the double homicide to him during a meeting they had arranged on September 22, 2001, at Wishard Hospital.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-WTL, Document 2, Page 5.

January 7, 2003 His defense was that he had been influenced by Sarah Pender at the time of the murder, which was considered at the time by the court as a mitigating factor. He received two 45 year sentences.Court of Appeals of Indiana, No. 49A02-0304-CR-359 , Richard Hull Vs State Of Indiana, December 9, 2003 =Controversies=Over letter The only hard piece of evidence presented at Pender's trial as proof of her guilt was the letter that she allegedly wrote on May 16, 2001, and sent to Hull. Hull gave this letter to his attorney, who passed it on to Indianapolis detective Kenneth Martinez between September and October 2001.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 2-11, Page 8. Pender, her lawyers, and her supporters have always said that Hull had manufactured the evidence to shift the responsibility of the murder on her. Several elements support this claim. # Richard Hull himself, in a signed affidavit, has recanted and admitted the letter was a forgery. In it, he has explained that while he was detained at the Marion County Jail, he showed samples of Pender's handwriting to fellow inmate Steve Logan and asked him to write the letter for him, since Logan wrote more like a woman. In return, Hull would provide protection on the cell block for Logan, who was a small white guy. By producing the forged letter, Hull's goal was to get a shorter sentence.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 2-11, Pages 8-9. However, on May 4, 2004, when he appeared for re- sentencing, the court found as an aggravating factor the notarized affidavit in which he admitted the forgery, since it contradicted his earlier testimonies. The court found \\"an additional aggravating factor [that arose since the original sentencing], which, actually, is very serious. [Hull] appears to have committed perjury in an effort to help his co-defendant manipulate her way out of a criminal conviction for [the] very serious offenses of murder.\\"Court of Appeals of Indiana, No. 49A02-0504-CR-298 Richard Hull Vs State Of indiana, December 30, 2005 p 8-9 While admitting the May 16 letter was a forgery resulted in a heavier sentence for Hull, it was of no benefit to Pender. # Fingerprints from both Hull and Logan were found on the letter,US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 2-11, Page 6 but not those of Pender. # Detective Kenneth Martinez could not find a sealed envelope to match the letter. # Most of the eighty letters sent by Pender to Hull were in cursive writing. The alleged self-incriminating letter was printed, which was less common. # While Logan has always stopped short of admitting he wrote the May 16 letter, he has testified that Hull showed him letters written by Pender and also asked him to write some sort of letter as a way to reduce his charges or sentences, which Logan claims he did not do. On another occasion, according to Pender, Logan also admitted to a private investigator hired by Pender that Richard Hull had requested that the forged letter be written.Sarah Pender Manuscript letter to \\"America's Most Wanted\\" January 26, 2009 (this is also alluded to in the court document mentioned in the previous footnote) # Between the alleged time of redaction of Pender's alleged self-incriminating letter (May 16, 2001), and the moment it was given to him by Hull's attorney (September‚ÄìOctober 2001), pursuant to a search warrant, detective Kenneth Martinez ceased jail correspondence between Hull and Pender on July 17, 2001.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH- TAB, Document 2, Page 5 He did not find the May 16 letter, even though Hull had allegedly kept it during all that time.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 2-11, Page 9 Over Pennington's testimony At the beginning of September 2001, Floyd Pennington was a habitual offender and violent felon awaiting sentencing on a robbery conviction.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 2, Page 6.

He had been involved in a correspondence with Pender which totaled at the time 75 letters. This had evolved into a long-distance relationship.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 12-4, Page 11. After his meeting with Martinez, he wrote to Pender to arrange the date on which she would fake being sick so as to be sent to Wishard Hospital. On September 22, he faked having a kidney problem and both met as planned at the hospital. On September 28, 2001, Pennington gave a statement according to which he had been able to talk with Pender for three to four hours. He said that they were left alone for half an hour during which Pender admitted to planning the murder, coercing Hull to kill both Cataldi and Nordman, and being present in the house at the time of the murders.US district Court ‚Äì Southern District of Indiana, Case 1:07-cv-00464-DFH-TAB, Document 2, Page 5 & 6. Pennington was sentenced eleven days after he agreed to testify against Sarah Pender. He was released in 2008 and committed a rape within months.Indiana Offender Database Floyd Pennington 873562 In 2006, Detective Martinez moved to Idaho where he worked for the Ketchum Police Department. In 2008, he had to hand over his resignation following an evidence mishandling scandal.Smith, Terry AG report Zeroes in on Ketchum detective The Idaho Mountain Express August 1, 2008, In 2009, while helping journalist Steve Miller with research on the Sarah Pender case, former prosecutor Larry Sells became aware of the existence of a snitch list written by Floyd Pennington and given to Detective Ken Martinez.Ryckaert, Vic. 'Female Charles Manson' Sarah Jo Pender didn't get fair trial, says former deputy prosecutor who convicted her The Indianapolis Star June 6, 2013 On that list, Pennington, who was waiting for sentencing, offered to provide information against 17 different persons besides Pender. He wrote \\"I will help to make buys, wear wire, talk on phone taps or whatever I have to do to make busts on all these crimes\\".Copy of Floyd Pennington's Snitch list published on documentcloud.org by the Indianapolis star The list, an indication that Pennington was willing to testify against any number of people to get a deal, seriously undermined Pennington's credibility and undermined the prosecution's theory about Pender's guilt. It was not given to either the defense or the prosecution at the time of Pender's trial. This discovery led Larry Sells to believe that Sarah Pender did not get a fair trial. In an interview with the Indianapolis Star, he explained: \\"If I'd have seen that I never would have put Floyd Pennington on the witness stand.\\" In May 2012, he contacted Bonnie Prosser, Pender's mother, and promised to help her set things right. According to Joel Schumm, a criminal law professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law, \\"If Pennington's testimony was important in convicting her and this list seriously undermined his credibility, a judge may well order a new trial because the verdict would no longer be worthy of confidence.\\"Ryckaert, Vic. 'Female Charles Manson' Sarah Jo Pender didn't get fair trial, says former deputy prosecutor who convicted her The Indianapolis Star June 6, 2013 Escape from prison Pender escaped from Rockville Correctional Center, a maximum-security prison west of Indianapolis, on August 4, 2008, with the aid of prison guard Scott Spitler Sr, and former cellmate Jamie Long. = Assistance= At the time of Pender's evasion, Scott Spitler had been a corrections officer at Rockville Correctional Facility for five years. The previous month, he had been placed in a pre-trial diversion program for a misdemeanor charge of battery. Although he was married and had children, he was also engaged in an ongoing sexual relationship with Pender behind bars.Court of appeals of Indiana, No. 61A01-0903-CR-139 Scott A. SPITLER, Appellant-Defendant, v. STATE of Indiana, Appellee-Plaintiff., July 01, 2009. Jamie Long was an older married woman. She had a criminal history of two felonies and 12 to 15 other convictions. Both women had met in 2007 while they were inmates at the Marion County Jail. They formed an intimate relationship and Long referred to Pender as her \\"wife\\" while they served time at the Indiana Women's Prison in Indianapolis. After her release, Long frequently visited Pender.Court of appeals of Indiana, No. 61A01-0812-CR-562 Jamie Long Vs State of Indiana, March 27, 2009. =Circumstances= In April 2007, Pender submitted a petition for writ of habeas corpus. On September 5, 2008, in a closing judgment, her petition was dismissed. She later wrote: \\"Once my appeals were exhausted, I had no hope left and I chose to create my own justice. I served the equivalent of 21 years of my sentence and I felt that was enough. I escaped because I felt justified in doing so.\\" =Jailbreak= Pender reportedly planned her escape with a cell-phone provided to her by prison guard Spitler. Pender and Spitler had agreed he would be paid $15,000 to help her escape. On August 4, 2008, Pender went to the facility's gymnasium, where she changed clothes, hiding her prison uniform above the ceiling's tiling and putting on civilian clothes that Spitler had given to her. She then walked toward the fueling area where they had agreed to meet. Spitler told her to get in the van and hide under the seat. He then drove to the prison's gate where he knew, out of experience, that the guard would not search his vehicle. Spitler dropped off Pender at one of the facility's parking lots, where Jamie Long picked her up, gave her $140, and drove her to Indianapolis. An inmate count revealed that Pender was missing. The prison was put on maximum security lock down. After viewing video surveillance tapes and consulting the guard shack log, investigators identified Spitler as Pender's accomplice. He was arrested on August 5, 2008, and charged with assisting a criminal, official misconduct, sexual misconduct, and trafficking with an inmate.Officer Arrested After Convicted Murderer Escapes From Prison theindychannel.com, August 5, 2008. In February 2009, he was sentenced to eight years in prison.Prison Guard Gets 8-Year Sentence For Aiding Escape theindychannel.com, February 18, 2009. Jamie Long was arrested on August 7, 2008, after Spitler told investigators that she was the person who had picked up Pender.

On January 25, 2018, Pender was transferred back to Rockville Correctional Facility.  Current appeals During the summer of 2016, Cara Wieneke, Pender's lawyer, filed a motion with the Marion County prosecutors office, requesting a deal that would free Sarah Pender.

This comparison was relayed by the media on several occasions and it has regularly resurfaced since in the online media. Supporters of Pender claim that this comparison is inappropriate because Pender did not plan, commit, or pressure Hull into murdering Nordman and Cataldi. They claim that even if Pender had been involved in planning the murders, the comparison would be grossly exaggerated; Charles Manson was a guru with a juvenile offender record and a psychiatric history who led several members of his sect to commit several murders on several occasions over a period of several months. In 2009 and during his trial, Spitler explained that he had been manipulated by Pender. At the time of the escape, Indiana Department of Correction Commissioner Edwin Buss told the media that Pender had \\"manipulated him to the point where [he had planned his day] to get a vehicle inside the facility and take her outside the facility.\\"Officer Arrested After Convicted Murderer Escapes From Prison theindychannel.com, August 5, 2009. Detectives said that she had first seduced, then coerced, Spitler into helping her to escape.

Sarah Pender was a vampire in the emotional and mental sense.\\"Miller, Steve. \\"Girl Wanted, the chase for Sarah Pender\\", p295 Pender has written that \\"the media, including 'America's Most Wanted', has selectively used facts in order to manipulate the viewers to believe I am a degenerate, dangerous criminal in return for sensational story and higher ratings under the guise of bringing justice.\\" Supporters of Pender claim that Spitler was aware of the media's depiction of Pender and used it to minimize his responsibility. They point out that Spitler did not act out of a misguided love for a femme fatale when he helped Pender to escape Rockville Correctional Facility; rather, he was expecting a $15,000 payment for his services, a fact that the media did not report, neither during Pender's escape, nor before or during or after Spitler's trial. Pender's supporters further point out that the relationship between Pender and Spitler was not an exception at Rockville. Two months after her escape, in October 2008, Roger Heitzman, another correctional officer at Rockville, was arrested by the state police for trafficking and engaging in sex acts with at least one female inmate. Because the case was not high profile, no one claimed Heitzman was a victim manipulated by the inmate involved.Court of appeals of Indiana, No. 61A01-0903-CR-139 State police arrest Rockville Correctional officer tribstar.com October 3, 2008. Supporters of Pender finally claim that the Department of Corrections also had an interest in exaggerating Pender's abilities in order to minimize media damage and their own responsibilities. The Rockville Correctional Facility's hiring policy had already gotten bad media publicity in February 2008, when it was revealed that mass murderer Steven Kazmierczak had been hired there in 2007 to work as a correctional officer.\\"Northern Illinois Shooter worked at Rockville Correctional Facility in 2007\\" Tribstar.com, February 15, 2008 The fact that the guard posted at the gate did not search Spitler's vehicle on the day of the escape as he should have, Spitler's behaviour, Heitzman's arrest, and the hiring of Kazmierczak are elements that clearly pointed out problems within the institution which, when considered, had little to do with Pender's personality. Supporters of Sarah Pender point out that she committed no violence of any kind in planning or executing her escape. Media A book on her escape, Girl, Wanted: The Chase for Sarah Pender, was released June 7, 2011. The book, written by Steve Miller, has been criticized as inaccurate and deliberately quoting key documents in a misleading way.https://sites.google.com/site/justsarahjo/debunking-girl-wanted Fair justice for Sarah Pender : Debunking Girl Wanted Steve Miller's investigation, however, brought to light Floyd Pennington's Snitch list.Miller, Steve. \\"Girl Wanted The Chase For Sarah Pender\\" p 115. According to former prosecutor Larry Sells, reading the book led him to reconsider his position on the fairness of Sarah Jo Pender's 2002 trial. In April 2011, a Mail-Art Project \\"Send us YOUR Hand\\" has been launched by Pender, her family, and friends under the organization \\"Art for Humanity\\" to raise support and help Pender, who had been in solitary confinement since 2008, to remain connected to the outside world.

After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition, and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea. Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the Huon Peninsula, using infantry, tanks, and air strikes against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, exhaustion and suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces. During the advance, Australian troops captured Japanese cryptographic materials. This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific, as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously. Background alt=map indicating the Allied advance along the coast of New Guinea General Douglas MacArthur's Operation Cartwheel began with spectacular victories in the landing at Lae and the landing at Nadzab but then faltered in the face of inclement weather, unfavourable terrain, and‚Äîabove all‚Äîtenacious and aggressive Japanese opposition on land and in the air.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, p. 148 The initiative passed to Major General Hataz≈ç Adachi's Eighteenth Army which launched a series of counter-attacks against Major General George Wootten's 9th Division in the Battle of Finschhafen.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, pp. 149‚Äì177 At the Battle of Sattelberg, Wootten finally inflicted a crushing defeat on Adachi.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, p. 227 Although beaten, the Japanese did not leave the area. Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, the commander of the Japanese 20th Division, ordered the 80th Infantry Regiment to hold the Wareo area to protect the withdrawal of the 79th Infantry Regiment and other units. The 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment was to act as a rearguard on the coast.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, p. 236 Lieutenant General Frank Berryman, the commander of Australian II Corps, now urged Wootten to commence a coastal advance to cut the Japanese supply lines and force Adachi to retreat from the Huon Peninsula if he were not already doing so. Wootten took a more cautious approach.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, pp. 228‚Äì229 The Battle of Wareo proved that the Japanese intended to defend the area. After a fierce fight, Wootten managed to drive the Japanese from the high ground around Sattelberg and Gusika. In early December, Adachi ordered all his troops to withdraw to Sio. Wareo was captured by the Australians on 8 December and the last Japanese rearguards left the area on 15 December.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, pp. 675‚Äì679 Meanwhile, Berryman's coastal advance had commenced on 5 December. PreludeOffensive against the Japanese supply system= alt=Silhouette of a boat moving at speed across the water. Early in October 1943, a special staff was established at II Corps Headquarters to study the Japanese supply system. It did not include an officer with experience in maintaining a large force over a native carrier line, and therefore took time to realise that the Japanese force could not be maintained over an inland track, as was first assumed. Operations soon confirmed that the Japanese were dependent on a coastal supply line. During the Battle of Sattelberg, the Allies set out to cut this supply line. A three- pronged approach was taken: :# Collecting centres for native foodstuffs and tracks leading from the coast were bombed by the US Fifth Air Force. This reduced food stocks available to the Japanese, and also drove away the native carriers that the Japanese depended on to carry their supplies up from the coast. :# PT boats of Task Group 70.1 attempted to interdict barge traffic along the coast by night, while Fifth Air Force fighters conducted sweeps for barges by day. :# The land forces attempted to physically cut the Japanese supply lines. The 9th Division captured Pabu, thereby cutting the most convenient inland track, while the landing on Long Island occupied an important barge staging area.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 731 By December, the pitiful condition of Japanese prisoners confirmed for the Australians that \\"the Japanese logistic system was in the final stages of breakdown\\". Between 9 and 13 December, PT boats sank 23 barges, most of them south of Sio. On 7 January, the PT boats also attacked a submarine. No less than twelve barges were destroyed on the night of 8 January, one of which was loaded with ammunition and another with around 70 troops. On 9 January, PT boats attacked a group of six barges, which attempted to fight back. One barge was seen to sink. Another patrol engaged eight barges and destroyed two. A third patrol found six barges on a beach and destroyed them. Then on 10 January, three PT boats sank three troop-carrying barges, taking one Japanese prisoner. The same night, two barges were also sunk north of Sio Island.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 734 When General Berryman saw Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of the Allied Naval Forces, on 14 December, he made a point of congratulating him on the work his PT boats were doing.Berryman diary, 14 December 1943, Australian War Memorial: AWM93 50/2/23/331 Lieutenant General Tsutomu Yoshihara, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Eighteenth Army recalled: =Tactics and logistics= Matilda tank of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion, fires at a Japanese foxhole.alt=A tank fires into the jungle. The main Australian advance was by infantry-tank-engineer teams moving along the coastal tracks.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, p. 243 Japanese positions were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, except for short periods during the latter stages of the operation when Japanese opposition was negligible and the difficulty of moving the artillery forward quickly was too great.Report on Operations ‚Äì 5 Aust Div: Operations from Sio to Saidor 20 January ‚Äì 29 February 1944, Australian War Memorial: AWM54 519/6/48 A secondary outflanking movement was made inland, over the higher ground, which was usually coral cliffs covered by kunai grass and rising as high as . Since the Japanese intent was to delay rather than fight to the death, a threat to their escape route usually prompted a withdrawal. When this did not occur, the position was reduced by a combination of manoeuvre and tank, mortar, and artillery fire. During the early part of the advance, 4,700 rounds were fired in one day; but during the entire 5th Division advance from Sio to Saidor, only 30 rounds were fired. The advance was made in a series of bounds, the objective of which was usually to secure sheltered beachheads. alt=About forty troops wearing slouch hats and carrying rifles packed into a landing craft travelling across open water, viewed from the stern towards the bow ramp. Allied supply was entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms,Casey, Amphibian Engineer Operations, p. 97 advanced with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side as they were secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was brought in by landing craft to set up an administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be brought up by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead. The major problem was the weather. The monsoon caused rough seas that precluded the use of the small Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVPs) and restricted the operations of the larger LCMs. Because of the extremely rough seas‚Äîthe most difficult that the 532nd EBSR had ever encountered‚Äîmost supply missions were by night when tidal conditions were most favourable.Monthly Historical Report of Operations ‚Äì 2d ESB, January 1944, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: X-78 E-20-1 Wootten insisted that at least seven days' supplies be available in forward areas in case the weather prevented the LCMs from running. II Corps made available two trawlers, manned by the 1st Water Transport Group, to deliver rations. The Australian Army also moved supplies by DUKWs. BattleFortification Point= alt=map of New Guinea coast with arrows indicating route taken by the Australian advance. Wootten designated Brigadier C. R. V. Edgar's 4th Infantry Brigade, a Militia formation, for the initial phase of the coastal advance, reserving his veteran Australian Imperial Force brigades for the Battle of Wareo. The brigade consisted of the 22nd and 29th/46th Infantry Battalions from Victoria and the 37th/52nd Infantry Battalion from Tasmania.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, p. 241 Each battalion was allotted a team of advisors from the 9th Division. Under Edgar's command was C Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion, with seven Matilda tanks, 9th Platoon, C Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion, and detachments from the 532nd EBSR, Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU), Australian Army Service Corps (AASC) and Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC). In support were the sappers of the 2/7th Field Company and the 24 25-pounders of the 2/6th Field Regiment. In case Edgar got into trouble, the 20th Infantry Brigade was in reserve, on six hours notice. To support the advance, a beach maintenance area was prepared at a beach at the mouth of the Kalueng River, which involved removing underwater and landward obstacles. So that the tanks and jeeps could immediately support the advance, a bridge was required over the Kalueng River. A preliminary operation by the 22nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1943 secured a crossing area and a log bridge was constructed. The operation jumped off on 5 December, with the 29th/46th Infantry Battalion passing through the bridgehead established by the 22nd. It soon came under sporadic enemy fire, and a tank was disabled by a land mine.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 714 In the face of mounting opposition, the advance was halted near the lagoon. It resumed the next day, and the Japanese withdrew after an artillery bombardment, their orders being \\"while avoiding any decisive engagement\\" to \\"carry out successful resistance to try to delay the enemy advance\\".Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 715 This became the pattern, with the Japanese preferring to withdraw rather than suffer heavy casualties.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 718 On 10 December, Edgar brought all three of his battalions into the line and by 14 December they were closing in on Lakona, a key position on the 20th Division's retreat route.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 722 The tanks had difficulty keeping up with the advance. One obstacle was mines. On the first day, the 2/7th Field Company lifted fourteen mines but a tractor broke a track running over a mine. On 7 December, two more tanks were damaged by mines, one beyond repair. The sappers then cut a new track which they corduroyed.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 716 To support the attack on Lakona, the tanks had to cross a creek with steep coral banks, swollen by a torrential downpour. While efforts were made to bring up a compressor, tanks fired into banks and holes were packed with explosives and detonated. On the evening of 16 December, the infantry were joined by five Matilda tanks and overran the Japanese positions. They counted 47 Japanese dead; and killed another 17 in mopping-up operations the next day.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, pp. 722‚Äì724 On 20 December, aided by four Matilda tanks and 750 rounds from the 25-pounders, the 4th Infantry Brigade occupied the Fortification Point area. Between 5 and 20 December, the 4th Infantry Brigade reported 65 killed and 136 wounded.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 725 Japanese casualties were 420 killed and 136 found dead, victims of disease, malnutrition, and suicide. Only six Japanese prisoners were taken. =Sio= On 21 December 1943, the 20th Infantry Brigade passed through the 4th Infantry Brigade and initiated the second stage of the pursuit. Generals Blamey, Berryman and Wootten visited the acting brigade commander, Lieutenant Colonel N. W. Simpson, and emphasised that the brigade was to minimise casualties where possible by employing artillery and tanks. That afternoon, the lead company of the 2/13th Infantry Battalion reached Hubika.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 727 The battalion diarist recorded: alt=map of New Guinea coast with arrows indicating route taken by the Australian advance. A halt was called for Christmas while supplies were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding, and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare be available to all units, and extraordinary efforts were made to carry out his directive. In one instance, a Piper Cub of No. 4 Squadron RAAF dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company on a long-range patrol.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 729 The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 B-25 Mitchell and 12 Boston bombers. The 2/15th Infantry Battalion and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had a sheltered beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American landing at Saidor placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 730 Before moving over the mountains, the 20th Division headquarters elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page a slow and difficult process, and a fire might attract the attention of the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it was on its way to the Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio codebooks in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.Drea, MacArthur's Ultra, pp. 92‚Äì93 On 11 January a platoon of the 2/17th Infantry Battalion replaced a rope ladder, and after climbing it and two wooden ladders reached an area atop a cliff which had once been a Japanese headquarters. It would have been a formidable position if defended, but it was not. The main body of the battalion followed the next day. The Goaling River was crossed in small boats left behind by the Japanese on 13 January and it entered Nambariwa, where one prisoner was taken, six Japanese were shot, and nine found dead. On 15 January, Sio was taken. The Sio-Nambariwa area was found to have been the principal Japanese supply area, and a large number of fuel, supply, and stores dumps were found.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, pp. 735‚Äì736 During the advance from Fortification Point to Sio, 303 Japanese had been killed or found dead, and 22 captured. The 20th Infantry Brigade had lost 3 killed and 13 wounded, but 958 had been evacuated sick, mostly with malaria, and an epidemic of dengue had also taken its toll. Large quantities of Japanese equipment had been captured, including six 75 mm guns, three 37 mm guns and three 20 mm guns.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 736 =Saidor= Sergeant Bengari, MM of A Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. He is carrying an alt=A bare- footed man with a short back and sides haircut wearing an army shirt and short skirt, carrying a weapon on a shoulder strap. At 1800 on 20 January 1944, the headquarters of Major General A. H. Ramsay's 5th Division, which had come up from Lae, replaced that of the 9th Division. At the same time the 8th Infantry Brigade replaced the 20th. The 8th Infantry Brigade, which had spent much of the war on garrison duty in Western Australia, began departing Cairns on 10 January. The original intention had been for it to go to Lae to relieve the 29th Infantry Brigade, which had fought in the Salamaua-Lae campaign, but in December it was decided to ship it directly to Finschhafen. The brigade contained three infantry battalions, the 4th, 30th and 35th, all from New South Wales. It also still had the support of the 2/12th Field Regiment, 532nd EBSR, and A Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. The brigade suffered its first casualties on the night of 21/22 January in a friendly fire incident, which was a common occurrence with units inexperienced in jungle warfare. Two Australians were killed and two wounded by their own comrades.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 764 On 22 January a native reported seeing seven Japanese in the hills south-west of Sio and a patrol was sent out under Corporal Bengari to investigate. On arriving in the vicinity on 24 January, a local reported that another 22 Japanese had arrived. The next morning, Bengari and his five companions ambushed the Japanese and killed them all before they could fire a shot.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 765 Wirraway and Boomerang aircraft of No. 4 Squadron RAAF scouted ahead of the advance. Its aerial reconnaissance work let the Australians and Papuans know where opposition could be expected, thereby speeding up the advance. The pilots noted Japanese parachutes, signs that the Japanese were receiving supplies by air.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 766 On 4 February, the Australians were also forced onto air supply, as swollen rivers washed out a number of bridges.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 767 Each day the Papuans killed 12 to 15 Japanese, but not until 8 February was the Japanese rearguard encountered at Weber Point and a formal attack made. Five Japanese were killed. In all, 53 Japanese were killed and four captured that day. Two Australians were wounded. The next day another 61 Japanese were killed and 9 captured, this time without any Australian casualties. On 10 February, the 30th Infantry Battalion encountered two American soldiers at Yagomai, thereby linking up with the American force at Saidor.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 769 The 8th Infantry Brigade now began to mop up the area. On 18 February, the 35th Infantry Battalion attacked a Japanese force near Gabutamon, killing 40. Finding a force of about 100 Japanese at nearby Tapen, they attacked, killing another 52 Japanese for the loss of one man wounded, while the Papuans on their flanks killed another 51, of whom 43 were accounted for by Corporal Bengari and two other Papuans. The next day, the Papuans found and killed another 39 Japanese in the vicinity. At Tapen, the Australians and Papuans also found evidence that the Japanese had resorted to cannibalism.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, p. 770 In the period of 20 January ‚Äì 1 March 1944, 734 Japanese were killed, 1,775 found dead and 48 were captured. Australian casualties came to four killed and six wounded. Aftermath Both sides managed to accomplish their objectives; the Japanese withdrew, while the Australians exacted a terrible toll. The balance of losses was overwhelmingly against the Japanese, both in terms of men and equipment. It seems that only about 4,300 of the 7,000 troops under the command of the Japanese 20th Division who had originally been forward of Sio survived the withdrawal, and many of them were rendered ineffective through wounds, sickness, malnutrition and exhaustion.Dexter, The New Guinea Offensives, pp. 732‚Äì737 The opportunity to destroy the Japanese 51st Division was not seized. These troops lived to fight the Americans at the Battle of Driniumor River later in the year, and the Australians in the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign in 1945. On the other hand, the new base at Finschhafen was no longer threatened by the Japanese and became an important staging point for the Western New Guinea campaign. The capture of the Japanese ciphers at Sio allowed General MacArthur to carry out Operations Reckless and Persecution with a plan based upon sound intelligence rather than just his own intuition.Coates, Bravery Above Blunder, pp. 254‚Äì255 NotesReferences  * Category:1943 in Papua New Guinea Category:1944 in Papua New Guinea Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Category:Battles of World War II involving Australia Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:Conflicts in 1943 Category:Conflicts in 1944 Category:Operation Cartwheel Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II ","title":"Battle of Sio"},{"id":"20874232","text":"Tamora may refer to: *Tamora, Nebraska, village in the United States *TVR Tamora, British sports car People with the given name * Tamora Pierce (born 1954), American writer Fictional characters: *Tamora, character in William Shakespeare's play Titus Andronicus ","title":"Tamora"},{"id":"20874241","text":"Introduced in 1983, Cotrel‚ÄìDubousset Instrumentation is a treatment approach to scoliosis.

The album was the result of fifteen years of work by Swiss ethnomusicologist and producer Marcel Cellier and was released in 1975 on his small Disques Cellier label. Some of the recordings he made himself; others were taken from the archives of Radio Sofia. The album won a Grand Prix du Disque award. In the 1980s, Ivo Watts-Russell (founder of the British 4AD label) was introduced to the choir from a third or fourth generation audio cassette lent to him by Peter Murphy, singer from the band Bauhaus. He became thoroughly entranced by the music, and tracked down and licensed the recordings from Cellier. So in 1986, it was re-released on 4AD in the UK, in 1987 the Nonesuch label in the US and on the Philips label in other territories. Subsequent albums were released with similar titles: Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares, Volume 2 [1988], which won a Grammy Award in 1989; Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares, Volume 3 [1990]; and Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares, Volume 4 [1998].

The firm is based in Los Angeles and has offices in New York, Boston, and London. Since its founding in 1991, the firm has raised approximately $25 billion across seven funds. TCW/Crescent maintains a strategic partnership with TCW Group (Trust Company of the West), a leading institutional money management firm with approximately $180 billion in assets under management. History Logo in use by TCW/Crescent Mezzanine until the firm's 2010 separation from TCW In 1991, former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bankers Mark Attanasio, Robert D. Beyer and Jean-Marc Chapus founded Crescent Capital Corporation, a Dallas-based investment firm that invested in high yield bonds. After Drexel Burnham Lambert was forced into bankruptcy in February 1990 due to Michael Milken's involvement in the junk bond market, Attanasio and Chapus stayed behind to manage the bankruptcy estate. Drexel had $2 billion of high-yield securities, which gave them the largest distressed portfolio in the country at the time. Based on their successful experience with the Drexel estate, the founders organized Crescent Capital as an asset manager in 1991 to provide capital to middle-market companies and to manage distressed portfolios. Attanasio sold Crescent to the Trust Company of the West (later renamed TCW Group), an investment firm based in Los Angeles, in 1995. After the sale of Crescent, Attanasio remained a senior partner and chief investment officer of the firm's leveraged finance and mezzanine capital group.COMPANY BRIEFS:TCW GROUP INC.

It is set in the Honorverse and is the second in the Saganami Island series, spun off from the main Honor Harrington series. In this volume, the spin-off series is re-integrated with the main series as several scenes were repeated either exactly or from a different point of view. The actions in this book overlap those in At All Costs and Torch of Freedom. This novel, like The Shadow of Saganami, is almost entirely from the viewpoint of characters other than Honor Harrington.  Plot  The book begins with a retelling of several events that took place in At All Costs, from the point of view from main character Admiral Michelle Henke. As Honor Harrington's Eighth Fleet continues its devastating deep-strike raids into the territory of the Republic of Haven, Haven's technical wizard Admiral Shannon Foraker develops a defensive weapons system that she names Moriarty, after the malevolent archenemy of Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty, essentially a deep space station devoted entirely to missile fire control, enables Havenite planetary defenses to fire previously unmatched masses of missiles at invading forces. This system enables even Eighth Fleet, which has exceedingly capable anti-missile defense systems, to be attacked successfully, as not even Manticoran missile defense systems can stop tens of thousands of missiles targeted on the same ship. On one mission, Havenite Admiral Javier Giscard organizes an ambush in several systems expected to be attacked by Eighth Fleet. Three Havenite forces corner the Manticoran force when it arrives in one of the systems. After the Moriarty station fires a massive number of missiles from pods in orbit around the system's planet, Eighth Fleet is heavily damaged. One of Harrington's super dreadnoughts is destroyed outright, and many more are damaged beyond repair. Henke's force of battlecruisers also takes heavy damage, to the point where her flagship HMS Ajax loses the capability to flee the system with Harrington. The ship's \\"boat bays\\" are also damaged to the point where shuttles cannot leave, trapping the crew aboard. All appears lost for Henke, but the ship's crew manages to repair the ship to the point where shuttles can be used to evacuate it. Henke orders the evacuation, and simultaneously plans a counterattack using all of the ship's remaining offensive capability. Originally intending to sacrifice herself to see the plan through, the ship's flag captain orders her and her staff off just before the attack begins. As the Havenite fleet approaches an apparently evacuated Ajax, the ship fires all remaining missile pods into them, catching them by surprise. Damage comparable to that suffered by Eighth Fleet is sustained by the Havenites, who quickly completely destroy Ajax and all else that remains of Henke's force with vengeful fire. Henke is presumed dead by the Manticorans, as it is believed she did not make it off Ajax before it was destroyed. In reality, however, she got aboard the last evacuating shuttle with two of her officers, and was heavily injured as her ship exploded around them. The persons on board the shuttle, including Henke, are then picked up by the Havenite fleet, and they become prisoners of war. Henke's injuries, which include a shattered right knee, are treated by the Havenites. Admiral Thomas Theisman, the Havenite Naval Commander in Chief and a longtime respected adversary of Manticore, has mandated that all prisoners of war in the renewed conflict between Manticore and Haven are to be treated as fairly and humanely as possible. Henke recovers in a comfortable military hospital, during which time she is visited in turn by Theisman and Eloise Pritchart, President of the Republic. At one point Theisman even invites her to a formal dinner with him and his staff. After she recovers, Henke takes command as the senior Manticoran Prisoner of War on an island on the planet Haven. Henke discovers, to her surprise, that Haven has adopted a completely unorthodox approach to handling PoWs. The Manticorans present on the island are essentially left to their own devices, under the watchful eye of one Havenite officer, who is responsible for providing what is needed to Henke and the other PoWs under her responsibility to live in relative comfort. Although it appears that any time the PoWs on the island could just build a boat and leave, the island is actually under round-the- clock surveillance from space and, if necessary, a team of Havenite Republican Marines are ready at all times to prevent an escape in less than fifteen minutes. This experience significantly changes Henke's view of Haven. She realizes that Theisman and Pritchart really have restored the honor of the Havenite military, which previously had been considerably less noble in its treatment of prisoners. Henke spends six months as commanding officer of the Manticoran PoWs. One day, the Havenite military sends an aircar to the island, and she is summoned once again to the company of Theisman and Pritchart. Henke is informed that she will be paroled by the Havenite military, a practice previously unheard of. In return, Pritchart asks Henke, a close relative of Queen Elizabeth III of Manticore, to petition the Manticoran leadership for a peace summit between the Star Kingdom and the Republic. There is one more stipulation: Henke must give her legally binding oath that she will not command a force against the Havenite military, or otherwise act against the interests of Haven. This she does, and Henke is sent back to Manticoran territory. Henke convinces a reluctant Queen Elizabeth to personally meet with Pritchart on the capitol planet of the neutral Kingdom of Torch, which had been established by a covert joint effort between Manticore and Haven in the book Crown of Slaves, during the truce that preceded the current conflict. In the meantime, Henke and Manticore are put in a dilemma: she cannot go back to war against Haven, or else violate her parole. Yet, she is one of Manticore's finest tacticians, and the Manticoran Bureau of Personnel recognizes that her talents should not be wasted. Thus, she is assigned to become second in command to Vice Admiral Khumalo, in the distant Talbott cluster, which, in The Shadow of Saganami, successfully petitioned via plebiscite to become annexed by the Star Kingdom. While Talbott on the surface seems to be a relatively quiet and peaceful place far away from the titanic conflict between Haven and Manticore, things are not as they seem. In Saganami, the malevolent interstellar slaver corporation known as Manpower Unlimited attempted to use a local nation known as Monica as a proxy to force the Star Kingdom from Talbott, and take control of the lucrative wormhole terminus located there. By convenient chance, Captain Aivars Terekhov, commander of the heavy cruiser HMS Hexapuma stationed in Talbott, uncovered the plot and in a daring assault on the Monica system, completely destroyed Monica's military, thus ending the threat it posed to Manticoran control of Talbott. Despite a loss that results in Monica becoming a vassal of the Star Kingdom, and the public embarrassment of all involved in the plot, including Manpower and the Solarian League's Office of Frontier Security, Manpower almost immediately launches another plan to force Manticore from Talbott, and cause a conflict between the Star Kingdom and the League to serve its own mysterious ends. Taking advantage of widespread arrogance in the OFS and the Solarian League Navy towards (apparently) \\"lesser\\" nations like Manticore, Manpower manipulates the only star nation of the Talbott cluster that declined to participate in the annexation, the New Tuscan Republic, to engineer a false conflict between itself and Manticore. Manpower operative Aldonna Anisimovna meets with the New Tuscan leadership, confesses her organization's involvement in the Monica incident, and persuades them to support a new plot that she tricks them into believing will help preserve New Tuscan sovereignty. After a series of deliberately provoked incidents between New Tuscan merchant ships and Manticoran forces charged with inspecting them as they enter Manticoran territory, a fleet of ships under the command of one Admiral Josef Byng, a viciously anti-Manticoran and incompetent Solarian League Naval Officer, is dispatched to Talbott by the League. That Byng himself is even in command of this force is the work of Manpower and the OFS, who expect that in one way or another Byng will act irrationally when dealing with Manticore, and start a conflict. Byng himself is completely oblivious to the plot, and honestly believes that his true purpose for being sent to Talbott is to check Manticoran aggression against New Tuscany. Henke encounters Byng and through a Manticoran Naval Intelligence dossier on the Solarian Admiral, and after rather frosty conversation with the man, discovers Byng's nature and arrogant attitude towards all things Manticoran. However, she is powerless to do anything about the Solarian presence in the area. In the wake of this crisis, the reader is taken through several mysterious interludes on the planet Mesa, the homeworld of Manpower Unlimited. The overall leader of Manpower (and Mesa), Albrecht Detweiler, is shown discussing Manpower (and Mesa's) plans with various persons, including his several \\"sons\\" (actually clones). In each interlude, more and more is revealed about Mesan plans to finally come out of the shadows and launch a direct attack on the Manticore system with a secret weapon; stealth ships that travel without an Impeller drive and thus are completely undetectable by conventional means. Furthermore, it is revealed that \\"Manpower Unlimited\\" is actually just a front for the Mesan star nation itself, the Mesan Alignment, which is run by Detweiler and a cadre of other genetically engineered oligarchs set on galactic domination. The Mesan plot involving New Tuscany and Admiral Byng comes to a head. In the system where most of the engineered diplomatic incidents between Manticore and New Tuscany have taken place, New Tuscany scuttles one of their merchant ships as a Manticoran vessel is approaching for boarding and inspection, in an attempt to frame Manticore for its destruction. It is blatantly obvious that the detonations which destroyed the freighter were caused internally, but Byng wastes no time upon hearing of the incident to protect them against further Manticoran \\"aggression\\". Admirals Khumalo and Henke, unaware of Byng's presence in the system, send a small fleet of three destroyers to New Tuscany to officially complain about their actions. As soon as the destroyers arrive, Anisimova, using a nuclear device, destroys the largest New Tuscan space station in orbit around the planet, killing tens of thousands of New Tuscans instantly. Admiral Byng automatically assumes that the Manticoran destroyers are responsible, and orders his forces to open fire upon them in retaliation. As the destroyers are completely unprepared for combat and do not have their defensive systems activated, they are quickly wiped out by Byng's large fleet. Manticore is thus propelled into a state of war with the Solarian League. For Manticore, the events could not have come at a worse time. As most of the book takes place simultaneously with At All Costs, at this time Lester Tourville's massive attack on the Manticore system itself takes place, prompting the Battle of Manticore and the near-complete elimination of the offensive capabilities of Manticore and Haven. Recognizing his huge opportunity, Detweiler orders the deployment of his secret weapon on Manticore far earlier than he had originally intended. Commanded by one of his son-clones, the new Mesan Alignment Navy embarks on the stealth ships for the Manticore system. Admiral Henke, via a distress signal that was sent back to the Talbott Quadrant, learns shortly afterward of the Manticoran ships' massacre at New Tuscany. She immediately assembles all of her ships and embarks for the system. Upon her arrival, she orders Byng to stand down, warning him that Manticoran naval capabilities far exceed that of the Solarians on a qualitative basis. Byng, who considers this warning a desperate bluff, as he believes that the Solarian Navy to be invincible, instead of vastly inferior on technical grounds as it really is, refuses. After reiterating her warning several times, and being ignored each time, Henke launches a mass of missiles at Byng's ship from far outside the engagement range of the Solarian forces, completely destroying it. Recognizing their complete tactical deficit, Byng's second in command complies with Henke's demands. The Solarian Navy is dealt its first defeat in centuries. On planet Manticore, Queen Elizabeth meets with her inner circle to discuss the events that have taken place. During this meeting, Honor Harrington remarks that she believes conflict with the Solarian League had been inevitable, and the only way Manticore is going to survive is going to be to destroy the League as it is and break it up into several successor star nations which Manticore can deal with individually. Elizabeth initially rejects this new approach, believing that Haven, in the wake of that nation's devastating assault on Manticore, must be dealt with to prevent further assaults of that nature. However, Honor through her status as an empath, reveals that she has discovered via an extensive investigation that the renewed conflict between Haven and Manticore was engineered by Mesa to keep the two sides, both enemies to Mesa, distracted. Using the evidence she has uncovered, Harrington convinces Elizabeth to see things her way and attempt to reconcile with Haven. Events come to a climax. The OFS administrator responsible for his organization's involvement for the new Mesan plot with New Tuscany meets with a Solarian officer who has a powerful fleet of capital ships stationed relatively near Talbott. Taking advantage of the Solarian Admiral's own prejudices towards \\"neo-barbarian\\" nations like Manticore, and her rage over the destruction of Admiral Byng's flagship, he surreptitiously convinces her to prepare to attack Manticore in the Talbott cluster. Simultaneously, The Mesan Alignment Navy's stealth ships arrive in the Manticore system, and deploy many missile pods before turning to leave. The commander of this force remarks that in a period of weeks, Manticore will be dealt a devastating blow. The book then suddenly ends on a cliffhanger.

Schoene starred at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, where the 6-10 forward led the team to two straight Southern Conference championships (1981 and 1982) and an NCAA tournament appearance in 1982. As a senior, he averaged 13.6 points and 7 rebounds a game, and earned league tournament MVP honors. The Philadelphia 76ers selected Schoene in the second round of the 1982 NBA draft (45th pick overall). The 76ers traded him to the Indiana Pacers during his rookie campaign; he stayed in Indianapolis until the end of the 1983-84 season. During the 1984-85 and 1985-86 seasons, Schoene played for Olimpia Simac Milano of the Italian league, where his teammates included former Los Angeles Lakers head coach Mike D'Antoni and former NBA All-Star Joe Barry Carroll. The team won the Koraƒá Cup in 1985, and Schoene was named the Italian League MVP in 1986. On October 2, 1986, the Seattle SuperSonics acquired the rights to Schoene, along with guard Terence Stansbury and \\"future considerations,\\" in return for guard John Long. Schoene made the Sonics squad, and spent the next three seasons with the team. As a designated off-the-bench shooter in Seattle, he earned the nickname \\"Catch and Shoot,\\" firing a career-high 38.2% from three-point range in 1988-89. He scored a career-high 20 points on three occasions. Arguably his best NBA game was on April 24, 1988, when he had 20 points, four rebounds, a steal, an assist, and no turnovers in 33 minutes against the Los Angeles Clippers. Schoene wore #40 as a Sonic. Following the 1988-89 season, he accepted a three-year, $2.4 million contract offer to play for Glaxo Verona in the Italian League. He played in Italy for five seasons, and led Glaxo Verona to win the Coppa Italia trophy in 1991. In 1993, the Sacramento Kings waived him prior to the start of the season. At the end of his professional career, he spent time with the Rapid City Thrillers of the Continental Basketball Association. His career NBA statistics include 1,491 points (5.1 ppg), 735 rebounds (2.5 rpg), and 175 assists (0.6 apg). Schoene joined the Washington Huskies men's basketball coaching staff in 2002, following five years as an assistant at Bellevue Community College. He left the team to focus on Samurai Sam's following the 2003-04 campaign.

The Wynyard Cats entered the North West Football Union (NWFU) in 1925 after playing in a variety of competitions for the first four decades. The Cats were involved with the infamous \\"Goalpost Final\\" against North Hobart at West Park Oval in 1967, which was declared a \\"no result\\" after hundreds of fans invaded the ground and tore down the goalposts as North Hobart full-forward David \\"Dickie\\" Collins went back to take a kick after the siren with Wynyard leading by one point. In 1987, Wynyard joined the new Northern Tasmanian Football League (which was renamed the North West Football League in 2015), and has competed there since. Wynyard broke a 33-year premiership drought in 2012, with a 13-point Grand Final victory over Latrobe; and in 2014 they defeated Ulverstone by 116 points in the Grand Final to win a second premiership in three years.

Locklin was a member of the National Honor Society in high school. Stu was the oldest brother, and his other two siblings Mory and Ron Locklin were also exceptional amateur athletes at Appleton High. Appleton West honored Locklin in a ceremony in 2011. He enrolled in the University of Wisconsin on an athletic scholarship in the 1946‚Äì1947 academic year. As a freshman, he started at right end on the football team and as the center fielder on the baseball team. He led the baseball team in average (.352), hits, and runs as a freshman. Because of his potential as a baseball player, he gave up football and its high risk of injury after his freshman year. As a sophomore, he played on the varsity basketball team. He earned three letters competing as a Badger in his first two years of college, before signing a professional baseball contract with the Cleveland Indians organization in 1949. Although his amateur athletic career was over upon signing the contract, he continued to attend the University of Wisconsin and earned a bachelor's degree in business and a master's degree in education. Baseball career Stu began his professional career in 1949 and successfully began moving through the Indians' minor league affiliates at Dayton, Oklahoma City, and San Diego. In 1951, Locklin appeared to be about to enter his prime as a ballplayer and the Indians' purchased his contract from their triple AAA affiliate in San Diego, priming him for a big league debut in 1952. However, against the backdrop of the Korean War, he enlisted in the Air Force in 1952. He was stationed at Lockborne Air Force Base in Columbus, Ohio. Although his professional baseball career was on hold while he served in the Air Force from 1952 through 1954, Locklin was a member of the Lockborne AFB baseball team, coached by future New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. In 1955, Locklin made the Indians roster, primarily as a pinch hitter and runner. Locklin continued with the Indians into the 1956 season, when he suffered a leg injury and was optioned to the Indians' affiliate club. He returned to the Indians for spring training in 1957, but he did not make the roster. Locklin's professional baseball career continued for five more years in Indianapolis, Miami, Minneapolis, and San Diego. While playing for the Minneapolis Millers, Locklin participated in the 1959 Junior World Series against a team from Cuba. While playing most of the series in Cuba due to poor weather in Minneapolis, Fidel Castro attended each game. Before the deciding seventh game, Castro approached Locklin, pointed at his six-gun on his hip and stated \\"tonight, we win.\\" Locklin was traded to the Boston Red Sox organization late in his career. He retired from professional baseball after the 1960 season. Later life After baseball, Locklin became a school teacher, coach, and guidance counselor in his hometown of Appleton. He was a Catholic who volunteered extensively for various church organizations and charities. Late in his life, he moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. He died on December 4, 2016, at the age of 88.

The hospital was established by Dr. Martha Ripley in 1886 in response to the exceptionally high mortality rates for women in childbirth. Dr. Ripley was one of only a few female physicians in the late 19th century, and she employed only women as physicians and board members. The hospital provided services for primarily poor, unmarried, and widowed women. The hospital was originally located in a house at 316 15th Street South, but it quickly outgrew that house and moved to 2529 4th Avenue South. Demand continued to grow, so in 1896 the hospital purchased a house on of land at the corner of Glenwood and Penn Avenues. The hospital built the Marshall Stacy Nursery in 1909, followed by the Babies' Bungalow in 1910 and the Emily Paddock Cottage in 1911. Also in 1911, Ripley appealed to the government for funds to build an even larger building. Ripley died on April 18, 1912, of a respiratory infection. In 1916, the new building was completed. The hospital was renamed from Maternity Hospital to Ripley Memorial Hospital at that time. The hospital served the community until 1957, when it was closed due to low occupancy and funding problems. The hospital building was sold to Children's Hospital of Minneapolis, and the remaining funds were used to establish the Ripley Memorial Foundation. The foundation has sponsored teenage pregnancy prevention programs since 1993. The former hospital buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The building was redeveloped in 2007 by Aeon, a Minneapolis organization that provides affordable housing. The development, now known as Ripley Gardens, provides housing for low- to moderate-income residents, and provides both rental housing and home ownership opportunities. The redevelopment was one of twelve properties around the nation funded by the Restore America program, sponsored by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and HGTV.

Built as the merchant brigantine Industrious Bee in 1764 at Bristol, England, for operations by Clapman & Co., the British ship was captured on 29 August 1777 by Captain John Skimmer in the Continental schooner , while bound from Gibraltar for Newfoundland. The ship was purchased on 19 December by the Navy Board at Boston, fitted out with 18 guns, and renamed General Gates, Captain John Skimmer in command. Service history General Gates sailed from Marblehead on 24 May 1778, joining privateer brigantine Hawk off Cape Ann to cruise on the Newfoundland Banks. After capturing the ship Jenny and brigantines Thomas and Nancy, the two ships parted company early in August. Thereafter General Gates captured the schooner Polly. On 3 August 1778 she intercepted the brigantine Montague under Captain Nelson, who defended his ship in an epic engagement of five hours. After expending her ammunition, Montague resorted to firing \\"every piece of iron of all kinds that could be rammed into the tube of the cannon,\\" including jack knives, crowbars, and even the captain's speaking tube. A double-headed shot from General Gates crashed into Captain Nelson's cabin. Taking it up, Nelson fired it from one of his own guns. \\"This shot striking a swivel gun on the State's brig divided, and one part of it glancing instantly killed the active and brave Captain Skimmer.\\" It was two more hours before Montague struck her colors and capitulated to General Gates with Lt. Dennis in command. General Gates returned to Boston Harbor with prizes Polly and Montague on 31 August 1778. General Gates departed Boston on 14 November in company with Providence for Nova Scotian waters. She captured the schooner Friendship off Casco on 4 December and two days later, parted by a gale from Providence, subsequently cruised in West Indian waters. She captured schooner General Leslie off Bermuda in the first part of February 1779, then joined Hazard at Martinique. Together they captured brigs Active on 16 March and Union the following day. General Gates returned to Boston harbor on 13 April 1779, so unseaworthy from battering gales that her crew, at times, had despaired of ever reaching port. She was ordered sold on 2 June 1779. In August she was loaned by the Navy Board to the Deputy Commissary of Prisoners at Boston to convey prisoners to New York. On completion of this mission, she was sold.

Frank Baum, famous as the creator of the Land of Oz. It is the third volume in \\"the successful Aunt Jane Series,\\"Bookseller & Stationer, Vol. 24, Toronto, Maclean Publishing, 1908; p. 61. following Aunt Jane's Nieces and Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad. These books for adolescent girls constituted the second greatest success of Baum's literary career, after the Oz books. Like the other books in the series, the Millville volume was released under the pen name \\"Edith Van Dyne,\\" one of Baum's multiple pseudonyms. Genre Novels for adolescent readers can take many specific forms: after the family inheritance drama of Aunt Jane's Nieces and the travel adventure of Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, Baum cast his third book as a small-town drama with a bucolic atmosphere, in which a traditional society is contrasted with the world of the nouveau-riche rising business class. In this, the book resembles Baum's earlier novel Annabel (1906). In the view of Baum biographer Katharine Rogers, \\"the substance\\" of the Millville book \\"is humor at the expense of the local yokels.\\"Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 154. The novel has other aspects too, however. Baum would spend much of the last decade of his writing career working in the girl-detective veinBobbie Ann Mason, The Girl Sleuth, Athens, GA, University of Georgia Press, 1995. ‚Äî in his books The Daring Twins and Phoebe Daring (1911-12) and in the first five books of the Mary Louise series (1916-20). Yet he made his first ventures in the genre in some of the Aunt Jane books, notably here in the third book of the series. His handling of the detective genre here is satiric, though; the three cousins are influenced in their detecting effort by the novels they have read ‚Äì and their efforts are soon shown to be misguided and erroneous. (The plot does eventually resolve itself as something of a detective story, as the Merrick clan solves a mystery involving the fate of key supporting characters. The plot features a locked cabinet with a secret compartment ‚Äì with another secret compartment inside that.) Baum spreads his gentle and genial satire to other targets too, even to the popular fiction of his era. One character is a habitual reader of the \\"paper-covered novels\\" of the day, including one specific title, The Angel Maniac's Revenge.Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville, pp. 233, 236. Synopsis Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville picks up the story of the three cousins, Patsy Doyle, Beth De Graf, and Louise Merrick, soon after their return from Europe in Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad. As in that earlier book, their benign and eccentric millionaire Uncle John devotes much of his fortune to helping others ‚Äì an effort managed by Patsy's father, Major Doyle. These efforts do not always yield fiscally sound results: in one case, Merrick and Doyle loaned a few thousand dollars to a young inventor named Joseph Wegg for a patent he was developing ‚Äì but Wegg lost a patent lawsuit, and Merrick now owns the collateral on Wegg's loan, a farm in a remote region of upper New York State. In his capricious way, Merrick decides to take his nieces to the farm to escape the city's heat during the approaching summer; he arranges for a real- estate agent to get the farmhouse in good order and ships crates of furnishings to the place, sight unseen. Merrick and his three nieces come north, and find the farmhouse a surprisingly appealing place. The local inhabitants of a tiny village in the northern foothills of the Adirondack Mountains are naturally interested in the new residents; they call Merrick \\"the nabob.\\" The girls quickly become fascinated by the family of the previous owner. Joe Wegg's father had been a retired sea captain, and something of a recluse; his close friend Will Thompson went mad when Captain Wegg died, and both of their fortunes mysteriously disappeared. The girls meet and become friends with Thompson's daughter Ethel, the local schoolteacher. Also, the cousins (with Louise in the lead; she takes a more prominent role in this book than in the previous volumes) decide that Captain Wegg was murdered and robbed, and set about in search of suspects. They pry into the local past with limited results; but matters begin to clear when Joe Wegg returns home to convalesce from a car accident. The girls are dispirited to learn that there was no murder and no robbery. It is Uncle John who unravels a genuine mystery, as to the fate to the Wegg and Thompson fortunes. He recovers a missing deed that ensures that Joe Wegg and Ethel Thompson can marry in comfort and security. City and country As Rogers observed, Baum pokes fun at some of the small-minded habits of small-town people in this book. The real-estate agent is a comic stereotype of village crudity, pettiness, and envy; and one chapter is devoted to a bumpkin's inept attempt at finding a rich wife among the cousins.Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville, pp. 231-9. Yet Baum's view of urban and rural manners does not lean wholly one way. Baum approvingly contrasts the relative moral innocence or \\"simplicity\\" of the country with the \\"guile\\" of the city; and the three cousins are praised because they are \\"so simple,\\" without being \\"cityfied\\" or \\"stuck up.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville, pp. 230, 234-5. (The Aunt Jane's Nieces books have been studied for the light they cast on the \\"Progressive dilemma\\" of adapting \\"rural ideals to a complex urban society.\\")Fred Erisman, \\"L. Frank Baum and the Progressive Dilemma,\\" American Quarterly, Vol. 20 No. 3 (Autumn 1968), pp. 616-23. Commonalities Elements of Baum's other books, and also of his biography, turn up in Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville. The Wegg farm's servant Tom Hucks is described as :\\"A tall man, much bent at the shoulder and limping in one leg from an old hurt aggravated by rheumatism. His form was as gnarled as the tree-trunks in the apple orchard, and twisted almost as fantastically.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces at Millville, p. 52. Readers of the Oz books will recognize him as a precursor of Dr. Pipt in The Patchwork Girl of Oz (1913). The Millville book repeatedly mentions Plymouth Rock poultry; Baum was a devotee of Hamburg poultry, and published a book on the subject in 1896.

History  Classic World Productions is owned by Darryl Payne. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on July 30, 2005. In its Chapter 11 filing, the company was described as follows: \\"The Debtor is one of the most respected and resourceful entertainment companies for back catalogue music. The catalog features a diverse range of legendary artists, spanning all genres,including: Judy Garland, The Chi-Lites, Little Richard, Jose Feliciano, Kenny Rogers, and a host of others. The Debtor also carries an impressive collection of vintage television programs.\\" Other releases included albums by Sly and The Family Stone, Carol Douglas, Tommy Roe and The Electric Flag. =Dispute Over Royalties: The Tom Jones Show= At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, the principal creditor of Classic World Productions was C/F International, a licensor of television programs, among other media. As of December 2004, C/F International was a secured judgement creditor of Classic World Productions and Darryl Payne for approximately one million dollars, and was the principal secured creditor at the time of the bankruptcy filing. C/F International's action against Classic World Productions and owner Darryl Payne was based on unpaid royalties in relation to the Tom Jones television show from 1980‚Äì1981, \\"The Tom Jones Show\\",Show particulars and dates are accessible here and related recordings. C/F International's rights to later Tom Jones material were subject to dispute. In March, 2007, Tom Jones and Tom Jones Enterprises sued C/F International to stop C/F International from licensing sound recordings made from Jones' 1981 series of variety shows, \\"The Tom Jones Show\\", recorded in Vancouver, Canada. It was contended that any rights that C/F International had to license \\"The Tom Jones Show\\" did not include the right to make and license separate recordings of the performances on the show. In addition, it was contended that any rights that C/F International had in \\"The Tom Jones Show\\" no longer existed, due to numerous breaches of contract. Examples of contentious CDs include Live on The Tom Jones Show (released 2006) and Greatest Hits Live (originally issued by C/F International in 1981; later license to and CD issue by Prism Leisure Corporation as 30 Greatest Hits - Live in Concert). The 1969-1971 \\"This Is Tom Jones\\" television shows are currently offered by Time-Life, rather than by Classic World Productions or C/F International; Six months after the amount owed by Classic World Productions to C/F International had been judicially determined, Classic World Productions filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The assets of Classic World Productions were seized by C/F International, based on the latter's secured judgement creditor status. However, C/F International Judgement against Darryl Payne was dismissed. Tom Jones Enterprises secured a Judgement against C/F International for $9 Million USD. The facts of this case showed C/F International had no such rights to The Tom Jones Show. =Ownership Interest In The Judy Garland Show= Prior to its Chapter 11 filing, Classic World Productions had co-released, with Pioneer Entertainment and to great acclaim, various DVDs of the short-lived The Judy Garland Show. Darryl Payne, owner of Classic World Productions, had acquired the U.S. rights to these shows for a net payment of $900,000 in 1998 to Sid Luft, Judy Garland's former husband. These co-releases continued, with Pioneer successor corporation Geneon Entertainment, through 2006. Geneon Entertainment was primarily known for Japanese anime productions. The U.S. operations of Geneon Entertainment were closed in December 2007, with the Japanese parent selling the balance of its interest in Geneon worldwide to Universal Pictures International in late 2008. Darryl Payne currently asserts copyright ownership to all 26 episodes of The Judy Garland Show. .

The population of Miracle Valley as of the 2010 U.S. Census was 644. Miracle Valley Bible College The community of Miracle Valley was founded in rural Cochise County in 1959 by evangelist A. A. Allen, who established the Miracle Valley Bible College (MVBC) on 1240 acres along the south side of Highway 92. Since Allen's death in 1970 the property has been purchased and/or occupied by a variety of organizations: the Don Stewart Evangelistic Association, later the Don Stewart Association; the Southern Arizona Bible College, operated by the Hispanic Assemblies (until 1995); and the Miracle Valley Bible College and Seminary, operated by Harter Ministries (from 1999).Church state collide in Miracle Valley, Tucson Citizen, November 28, 2001. Retrieved 2015-03-13 The property was foreclosed on in 2009, and a subsequent sale in 2011 to Miracle Valley Arizona Ministries (founded by missionaries Gilles and Diane Langevins) fell through. In 2014 the property was purchased by another group planning to restore the abandoned and derelict campus and re-establish a bible college. Miracle Valley shootout In 1978-80 approximately 300 members of the Christ Miracle Healing Center and Church (CMHCC) moved from Mississippi and Chicago. They purchased property in the subdivision on the north side of Highway 92 across from the bible college. The founder of CMHCC, Frances E. Thomas, was a former disciple of Allen's at MVBC and attempted to purchase it after his death. Over the following two years numerous conflicts arose between the church members and the local community and law enforcement. Tensions escalated when it was discovered that five young children of church members had died over the previous year, with one and possibly four due to the church's refusal to seek medical attention. Faith healing was a major component of the church's teachings. Conflicts also arose when the church refused access to parents and law enforcement in retrieving the children of at least two families who had been illegally transported to the Valley against their parents' wishes. Racial tensions arose between the African American church members and the mostly white residents. In late 1982, a variety of incidents with law enforcement culminated when local sheriff deputies, with backup by state law enforcement, attempted to serve bench warrants for the arrest of three members of the church. A large group of church members confronted the officials and in the ensuing \\"shootout\\" two church members were killed and seven law enforcement officers were injured. One church member and one sheriff's deputy would later die of their injuries. The church members departed Miracle Valley in early 1983.

Nelson. Arc A Continental Navy warship, she is known as the first Continental command of Captain Isaac Biddlecomb in James L. Nelsons Revolution at Sea series. She was originally built as a privateer but was taken into the Rhode Island State Navy to stop in her attempt to stop all smuggling in that colony. There she accompanied Katy in capturing Roses tender, Diana. She was then purchased by the Continental Army for a mission to liberate gunpowder on Bermuda. On the way, however, she was taken by , but was later retaken by her crew. She made it back to Boston with a prize full of valuable gunpowder. She was later purchased by the Continental Congress to become one of the first ships of the United States navy. She accompanied Commodore Esek Hopkins in the Battle of Nassau and the capture of the brig Bolton. She took part in the squadron's fight with the Glasgow as chased her all the way to Newport. Before that mission, Ezra Rumstick had been demoted by the Continental Congress to second lieutenant, while a Roger Tottenhill from North Carolina took his place as first. Isaac Biddlecomb disliked Tottenhill, but tried not to show it, and was, in fact, accused of discrimination against Southerners by various members of his crew. When the convoy of men-o-war (mostly converted merchantmen) captured three Bahamian schooners, Biddlecomb was asked by the commodore to take charge of one of them, leaving Tottenhil in charge of Charlemagne. He did, taking with him most of his Northerner crew, and leaving Tottenhil more convinced of his discrimination against Southerners than ever. Her next mission was to carry Benjamin Franklin to France. After this was accomplished, she raided the British coast and succeeded in taking HMS Swan and HMS Hector. She later returned to Philadelphia in 1777. She was finally sunk by HMS Merlin in the fall of 1777 off New Jersey.

Passenger services on the line go from Tynda to the town of Nizhny Bestyakh, opposite the river from Yakutsk. In November 2011, construction of the railway reached Nizhny Bestyakh. The final step required to bring the railway into the city itself is a combined road and rail bridge, to be constructed upstream of Yakutsk where the river is narrower. The railway via Nizhny Bestyakh is planned in the long term to form the start of a railway towards Magadan and possibly even across the Bering Strait. Route The line is single-track, excepting the double- track section from Tynda to Bestuzhevo, which shared with the Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline (BAM). The full length of the line is not electrified. As in most of Siberia, construction and operation of the railway is complicated by the large temperature variations, ranging from under in winter to over in summer, as well as the challenges of building on permafrost in difficult terrain. The line currently has an official length of , branching from the Trans-Siberian railway at Bamovskaya station, near Skovorodino in Amur Oblast. The line continues north, joining the Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline near Tynda and continuing along the BAM for before branching northwards at Bestuzhevo. The line in this section crosses the Gilyuy River twice. Shortly after entering the Sakha Republic, the line passes through the Nagorny tunnel under the Stanovoy Range. In the highlands of southern Sakha Republic, the line crosses numerous further rivers, including the Iyengra and Chulman, before reaching the coal-mining area around Neryungri at around . The settlement of Berkakit, situated south of Neryungri, was founded in 1977 as the base for the railway's operations in the south of the Sakha Republic. Berkakit is the official starting point for the current project to construct the railway to Yakutsk (officially referred to as the Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Line), and the majority of the town's workforce is employed either in management or maintenance of the railway. To the north of Neryungri, the railway crosses the Aldan Highlands, before reaching Aldan at kilometer 686, where the main offices of the Yakutia Railways are located. The current terminus of the operating section of line is Tommot, on the right bank of the Aldan River at kilometer 767. Bridge over the Aldan River at TommotBeyond Tommot station, the railway crosses the Aldan on a bridge, the longest on the line (except for the planned bridge over the Lena). From here, the line continues to the settlement of Verkhnyaya Amga (station simply named Amga), where it crosses the Amga River. Provisional goods services began to Amga in 2006, with construction trains travelling as far as Kharbykan. Construction reached the settlement of Kerdyom, by the mouth of the Lyutenge on the Lena River, opposite the town of Pokrovsk, by 2008. From here, it was planned to start construction of a combined road and rail bridge across the Lena in 2009, in the area of the settlement Tabaga. The line was to continue to the city of Yakutsk, with a passenger terminal to be built, and an extension to the river port. With the expected difficulties in building a bridge across the more than 2 km-wide Lena, prone to massive flooding in spring and with moving ice during autumn, there has been much discussion of the rail head remaining on the east bank of the river, terminating in Nizhny Bestyakh, across the river from Yakutsk. This section has been built, the connection over the river to Yakutsk city being postponed. The route via Nizhny Bestyakh will now form the beginning of any further extensions towards Magadan. As of early 2014, there were twice weekly trains from Moscow and from Khabarovsk, ending at Neryungri. The travel time from Shturm (1st station of AYaM) to Neryungri (390 km) was 11 hours.http://rzd.ru From 2019, there are passenger trains to Nizhny Bestyakh.–†–æ—Å–∂–µ–ª–¥–æ—Ä –∏–∑–¥–∞–ª –ø—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑ –æ–± –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–∏ –¥–ª—è –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–Ω–æ–π —ç–∫—Å–ø–ª—É–∞—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–∞ –¢–æ–º–º–æ—Ç ‚Äì –ù–∏–∂–Ω–∏–π –ë–µ—Å—Ç—è—Ö ‚ÄìRoszheldor issued an order to open for permanent operation of the Tommot - Nizhny Bestyakh section (1 July 2019) History Ceremony at Neryungri in 1985, marking the beginning of construction towards YakutskConstruction of the AYaM began in the 1930s, with the construction of the spur line from Bamovskaya to Tynda (then known as Tyndinsky) as part of the planned construction of the Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline. This section began operation in 1935, but was then dismantled in 1940-41 as the Second World War saw the BAM project cancelled and the rails were reused for other projects closer to the front. Reconstruction of the Bamovskaya-Tynda section (known as the \\"Little BAM\\") began on 5 April 1972, almost two years before the government of the Soviet Union announced the revival of the BAM project in 1974. The start of provisional services on the Little BAM began in November 1976, with full services in October 1977. At the same time the line was extended northwards, the section Tynda-Berkakit opening in October 1979, later extending as far as Neryungri. From 1989, construction recommenced from Neryungri towards Chulman. This extension branches a few kilometers before the previous terminus of Neryungri-Gruzovaya (cargo terminal). Traffic was gradually extended to Chulman, Aldan and finally to Tommot, firstly construction and cargo traffic, followed by passenger services. The complete section to Tommot was declared open on 24 August 2004. Since this date a daily passenger service has run between Neryungri and Tommot, covering the 368 Kilometer section in around 8 hours. The bridge crossing the Aldan River in Tommot, at wide at this point the largest river on the planned route besides the Lena, was completed in the 1990s, although not initially used. A further section of around 60 km was under construction when financial problems halted the project. Construction resumed in 2005, with construction traffic able to operate through to Kharbykan by the start of 2007. Cargo traffic currently operates as far as Amga. In early 2009 the construction reached the dual settlements of Pokrovsk/Kyordyom, on the left and right banks of Lena respectively, some 78 km south of Yakutsk.News report about the construction funding and status, in Russian The first train was welcomed into Kyordyom on September 25, 2010.–ó–∞–¥–∞—á–∏ –ø–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–π –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–∏ –±—É–¥—É—Ç –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω—ã ‚Äî –Ø–°–ò–ê (Russian) The line to Nizhny Bestyakh was officially completed on November 15, 2011, with officials stating that a bridge across the river to Yakutsk would be constructed in the near future. On July 27, 2019, passenger trains started to go to Nizhny Bestyakh. Future planningLena crossing= Planning for the line almost as far as Yakutsk is complete, although there has been debate as to whether the line should end at the settlement of Nizhny Bestyakh, on the opposite bank of the Lena River from Yakutsk, or whether a bridge (or possibly tunnel) should be built. The decision for or against a river crossing depends on a number of questions regarding both costs and engineering challenges. The Lena is at this point more than 2 km wide, has a number of side streams, and can flood the valley to a width of up to 10 km during the snowmelt in spring. There is currently no bridge of any kind across the Lena in the Sakha Republic. Air travel is currently the only mode of transport to Yakutsk available year-round; land transport to the outside world is possible via ferry in summer, or by driving across the frozen river in winter. During spring and autumn, the moving ice on the river makes crossings impossible. The dual road-rail bridge would allow year-round land access to the city for the first time. The site being considered is across a narrow section of the river near Tabaga, 40 km upstream from Yakutsk.Bridge crossing across Lena river near Yakutsk On July 14, 2010, in Moscow, a meeting was held to discuss construction of a tunnel under the Lena river, instead of a bridge. Construction of a tunnel would be quicker and cost less than that of a bridge, as it would not be dependent on seasonal construction hampered by the river freezing over in autumn and breaking up in spring. The flooding situation of the river also makes the tunnel more attractive. However, the annual maintenance costs for a tunnel were estimated to be more than twice that of a bridge. Construction of a tunnel in permafrost also posed engineering challenges. (dead link)http://egorborisov.ru/content/view/731/18/ in Russian (dead link) In July 2013, the federal road agency, Rosavtodor requested a tender to build a three- kilometer road-only bridge over the river connecting Yakutsk to the A360 Lena highway, expecting a cost of $1.7 bn/56 bn RUB, and a 6-year construction period.Lena River Bridge to Provide Hope and Fruit This was cancelled due to funding being transferred to the new Crimean Bridge. In 2015, it was reported that Chinese interests, including the China Railway Construction Corporation, China Development Bank and four other Chinese construction companies, had expressed interest in financing construction of the bridge.Siberian Times - 1 August 2015 The head of Yakutia said in 2018 that construction could begin in 2020. Note that the leaders of the republic or oblasts don't have the funding needed, so their statements can be seen more as wishes. These projects need federal funding. =Eastwards= Future plans have been proposed for the extension of the railway line further to the east, towards the Kolyma region, Magadan and even Chukotka and a Bering Strait crossing which would link Russia with the United States. The Russian government in 2011 approved the construction of a US$65 billion Siberia-Alaska rail link and a tunnel across the Bering Strait. There are dreams among railroad enthusiasts about high speed trains between Europe and United States through Russia, but the Amur‚ÄìYakutsk Mainline is mostly too curvy to allow any high speed. Plans were announced in May 2012 by the governor of Magadan Oblast to extend the railway 1800 km eastwards of Yakutsk to Moma and onwards to MagadanRailway Gazette - News in Brief with construction scheduled to begin in 2016, according to the President of Yakutia.Magadan Media - Construction of Yakutsk-Moma-Magadan Railway to begin in 2016 In 2016 the railway project was included in the Federal railway development strategy plan until 2030.

Description of the Mosque by M. R. Bawa Muhaiyaddeen \\"When I came a second time in 1973 [from Ceylon to the USA] as I was in meditation, I saw that I was building a mosque. Like the mosque that I had started in Ceylon, it stopped when it was about 24 inches high. I was building a similar mosque here [in the USA]. The light of that mosque was so bright that it could give light all over America. From that mosque you could hear the adhan [call to prayer] from this world to the hereafter. I was building a mosque like that. \\"There were angels, Rasuls [messengers], and myself building the mosque. The only remaining job was the painting of the dome. Everything else was completed. Its beauty and its lights were indescribable. It was effulgent everywhere. It was a beautiful mosque. Only the final painting of the dome was not finished. Again I related this to the children [members] who were there. \\"That is a mosque in the heaven called Firdaus. That mosque was built here in America by me. In America, it is possible to find people with a lot of iman [faith] who could reach that Firdaus. There was only a little work to be completed on that mosque. After seeing this, I told the children [members] the mosque that I could not complete in Ceylon I have completed in the States. Similarly such a mosque will be built here. I saw this. It is according to this that we have all come here. This is Firdaus, that mosque.\\"August 24, 1974, quoted in 25th Anniversary Booklet \\"When you go to this Mosque outside and establish the right prayer, then you are really building a beautiful mosque within your heart, and that mosque is being built with God's qualities.\\"September 24, 1985, quoted in 25th Anniversary Booklet \\"The mosque that is here is not like the mosques that you see in the world. This is a mosque which has been built in Allah's protection. It is built out of His Daulat, His Wealth, and it is His Secret. The construction was by the angels and the heavenly beings. Their 'hands' have gone into the construction of this mosque. God's Qudrat, His power, is in this mosque. You think this mosque was built only last year. In fact, this mosque had been built long ago. The only thing we have done is to paint it. It is a mosque with extends to the seventh heaven above. It extends from the very beginning to the very end. It is a sufiyyat-marifat mosque. The only thing that was done recently was to have the upper part covered.\\"August 7, 1984, quoted in 25th Anniversary Booklet \\"In the same way as the Ka'bah was built and protected with the birth of every prophet, in this country, too, in the same way as this country was before with Iman-Islam, may You [Allah] reinstate that state. And even though this mosque is small , let it be filled with the prayers as at the Ka'bah. To all those who belong there, to all those who come here, render their prayers as though it were at the Ka'bah. To all those who pray at this ka'bah, give them benefit as though they had performed Hajj, the pilgrimage, to all those who pray. Ya Rahman, please fulfill this prayer. Wherever they pray the prayer is to Allah. Wherever they turn, it is toward You, Ya Allah. It is a prayer of plenitude. May you make this grow all the time. In every heart. In the heart of every child. Amin. Amin.

It was located about ten miles from the eastern boundary of New York City on the Hempstead Plains within what is now the village of Garden City. In September 1917, Camp Mills was named in honor of a former Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Major General Albert L. Mills, who had suddenly died the year prior in September 1916. Mills was awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Camp Mills was one of three camps under control of the New York Port of Embarkation with a capacity for 40,000 transient troops. The facility was one of several military establishments built during World War I in the Mineola, New York area that included the Aviation General Supply Depot and Concentration Camp; Hazelhurst Field (later Roosevelt Field) and Mitchel Field. History The mission of Camp Mills was initially the preparation of Army units prior to their deployment to Europe in World War I. It was established as temporary tent camp in September 1917 as a place to mobilize the 42nd Division, made up of National Guard units from various states. After the 42d left for the Western Front in France, the 41st Division followed, occupying the camp from October to November 1917. It was then ordered to be abandoned, but reestablished April 4, 1918, as a part of the New York Port of Embarkation at Hoboken, New Jersey to obtain additional facilities for troops in transit to Europe. Camp Mills location within the Port of Embarkation Hoboken (1917‚Äì1918). Camp Mills was expanded to a containment with wooden buildings for the accommodation of thousands of troops, who arrived from training camps across the United States. At Camp Mills the units waited until they could be scheduled for embarkation whereupon they would travel by trains of the Long Island Rail Road to board ferryboats for the overseas piers in Brooklyn or Hoboken and loaded onto troop ships. Those ships transported troops primarily to the ports of Liverpool, England, or Brest, France. Facilities at Camp Mills included a hospital, warehouses, bakery, delousing plant and other facilities. It eventually consisted of about 1,200 buildings with a capacity of 46,000, including space for 40,000 transients (about half in barracks, half in tents), a 500 inmate detention camp and 5,500 members of a permanent garrison. A very large number of American soldiers shipped out to France from Camp Mills, at its peak in September 1918, over 31,000 troops were stationed there. Notable individuals who were assigned during World War I were: Douglas MacArthur, Wild Bill Donovan, Joyce Kilmer and Father Duffy among them. F. Scott Fitzgerald was a soldier at Camp Mills. With the end of World War I in November 1918, Camp Mills then performed a mission to process the thousands of troops back into the United States as a demobilization center. Many returning units passed through it and were either demobilized or sent to other camps across the United States where the men were processed out of the Army and returned to civilian life. With the last troops returning from Europe during the summer of 1919, the camp was ordered to be abandoned and sold, although operations continued until March 31, 1920, when garrison troops were transferred elsewhere. In 1938 Camp Mills was incorporated into Mitchel Field as part of an Air Corps expansion. Aviation Concentration Center The Aviation General Supply Depot and Concentration Camp (Garden City) was a temporary wartime establishment located adjacent to Camp Mills, and shared many of its facilities. It was used for organizing, training, and equipping Air Service troops. Also originally a tent camp, it was established on 17 August 1917 to facilitate Air Service units for the purposes of embarkation to Europe, and after the armistice in November 1918, for the purposes of debarkation. The facility was later expanded with wooden buildings and turned into a containment. The Concentration Center was under the jurisdiction of the Operations Section, Department of Military Aeronautics. It was later re- designated as the Air Service Depot from October 1918 to April 1919 when it was consolidated with Hazelhurst Field and made part of Mitchel Field on 5 April 1919. Present-day Today, Camp Mills and the Aviation Concentration Center are a part of the urban community of the village of Garden City, and are totally unrecognizable from the urban area. A monument to the Rainbow Division (42nd) at St James Street and Rainbow Place in Garden City near the site of Camp Mills was restored and then rededicated on November 11, 2004.

The follow-up to 1988's Turn Back the Clock, Tall Stories features producer and songwriter Phil Thornalley as lead singer, following the departure of the band's frontman Clark Datchler. On the eve of the album's release, Thornalley and keyboardist Calvin Hayes were involved in a serious car crash that depleted the band's momentum. Once they recovered, the album was a commercial flop, and the band called it quits.Anderson, Michael R. (2008) The Ultimate 80's Music Book, lulu.com, , p. 37 The album featured contributions from XTC's Dave Gregory (lead guitar) and Kasim Sulton of Utopia (backing vocals). Background Following the commercial success of Turn Back the Clock, lead singer Clark Datchler left Johnny Hates Jazz at the end of 1988 to embark on a solo career. Despite the departure, which was described by Nocito in 1992 as \\"[not] a particularly amicable split\\", Nocito and Hayes decided to continue. In 1989, after a period of auditioning a number of singers, Nocito and Hayes invited Phil Thornalley to take the role. All three had known each other since childhood and originally recorded \\"Me and My Foolish Heart\\" together before Thornalley chose to leave and produce Robbie Nevil instead. Thornalley told the Newcastle Evening Chronicle in 1989: \\"I dumped them right in it the first time and I was not expecting to be invited back, but it's like coming full circle. I'm doing something I should have been doing five years ago.\\" In addition to his vocal abilities, Thornalley was able to fulfill Datchler's role as the band's songwriter. The new line-up's first release was the single \\"Turn the Tide\\", which reached No. 84 in the UK in late 1989. The Tall Stories was completed and delivered to Virgin Records in October 1990, but \\"internal politics\\" delayed the album's release until the following year. During mid-1991, Thornalley and Hayes were involved in a serious car crash which in turn delayed the album's release to 1992. Tall Stories was a commercial failure, including its two singles, \\"Let Me Change Your Mind Tonight\\" and \\"The Last to Know\\", although the latter did reach No. 57 in Germany during 1991. In 2011, Thornalley recalled how both Tall Stories and his 1989 solo album Swamp made him realise \\"my passion was for writing songs [and] not performing them\\". Speaking to Paul Sinclair of Super Deluxe Edition in 2013, Nocito said of the album: \\"We were sort of obligated. Even to me now, it's not a Johnny Hates Jazz album. It didn't feel like one. I can't really listen to that record, some things happened from a personal point of view, my mother died right at that time, Calvin had that car crash. So I don't want to go there.\\" He added to Magic Music Magazine in 2017: \\"There was a very bad car accident. Terrible timing but luckily nobody died. After the car accident no one wanted to continue.\\" Reception Upon release, Music & Media commented: \\"This new album introduces new lead singer Phil Thornalley. Yet the sound hasn't changed much since the days of their European hit single, \\"Shattered Dreams\\". The first single, \\"Let Me Change Your Mind Tonight\\", sets the tone for the rest of this melodic, soft pop album.\\" Phil Bryant of The Crawley News wrote: \\"Tall Stories has a number of influences, bits of Paul McCartney here, George Michael there and Tears for Fears in abundance. The ten songs are all pleasant enough, but maybe there's the rub! Pleasant it may be, but it isn't original.\\" In a review of the 1993 compilation The Very Best of Johnny Hates Jazz, Michael Sutton of AllMusic commented of the three tracks included from Tall Stories: \\"Sounding no different than anything on Turn Back the Clock, these tracks prove that Johnny Hates Jazz didn't lose their knack for soulful, danceable hooks after Datchler's departure.\\" Track listingPersonnel Johnny Hates Jazz * Phil Thornalley - vocals, instruments * Calvin Hayes - instruments, backing vocals * Mike Nocito - instruments, backing vocals Additional musicians * Dave Gregory - guitar solo (track 1) * Phil Palmer - acoustic guitar (track 2), guitar solo (track 8) * Jim Williams - electric guitar (tracks 2-3) * Ole Paulsen - additional keyboards (tracks 2, 4) * Tommy Faragher - additional keyboards (tracks 3, 6, 8-9), backing vocals (tracks 6, 8-9), bass (track 6) * Graham Brierton - bass (tracks 2, 5) * Frank Ricotti - percussion (tracks 1, 3-5, 8-9), vibes solo (track 4) * Tony Beard - drums (track 6), additional drums (track 1) * Molly Duncan - tenor saxophone (track 10) * Dan Duncan - big horn (track 1) * Simon Clarke, Roddy Lorimer, Tim Sanders, Paul Spong - horns (track 4) * New World Symphonia - strings (tracks 1, 3) * Del Newman - arrangement and conductor (tracks 1, 3) * Colin Campsie - backing vocals (track 1) * Kasim Sultan - backing vocals (track 2) * Kim Wilde - backing vocals (tracks 3, 5) * Tom Bailey - Eastern interlude (track 2) Production * Calvin Hayes - producer, mixing (tracks 3-10) * Mike Nocito - producer, engineer, mixing (tracks 3-5, 8-10) * Tom Lord-Alge - mixing (tracks 1-2) * Roy Spong - mixing (tracks 3-5, 8-10) * Phil Thornalley - mixing (tracks 6-7) * Chris Newman - Fairlight programming * Tommy Faragher, Lotti Golden - original track and programming (track 6) * Chris Dicker, Henry Bins, Darene Walder, Dan Duncan, Ren Swan, El Davinci, Helen Woodward, Richard Norris, Michael Ade, Mike Jarret, Mystery Tim, Eddie Briquet, Steve Gallagher - engineers, studio personnel Other * Larry Vigon - art direction, design * Brian Jackson - design * Chris Callis - photography * Cyndy Warlow - stylist References Category:1991 albums Category:Virgin Records albums Category:Johnny Hates Jazz albums ","title":"Tall Stories (album)"},{"id":"20875160","text":"Touchwood Hills are a range of hills located in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

It was one of the few HBC posts not built on a river and supplied by canoe. Rather it was a resupply point and stopping place on the part of the Carlton Trail which ran from Fort Ellice on the Assiniboine River northwest to Fort Carlton on the Saskatchewan River. It was part of the Swan River District managed from Fort Pelly. The first post was erected by Thomas Taylor in September 1852 in the Big Touchwood Hills. After about 10 years it was moved a few miles south to the Little Touchwood Hills. After about 14 years, in 1879(?Losey has 1876) it was moved a short distance northeast to its final location. It was in buffalo country and produced mainly buffalo pemmican and some muskrat fur. By 1895 the local Indians had been settled in reserves and Touchwood Hills Post became more of a general store and post office for the local settlers. It was closed in 1909 due to competition from the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway which was built nearby the year before. All that remains of the original fort are the cellar depression, and a segment of the Carlton Trail. The site is commemorated by a plaque, and concrete markers outline the locations of the original buildings.Touchwood Hills Post Provincial Park, Government of Saskatchewan.

It was also discovered that the affidavit certifying the surrender was not properly sworn according to the statutory standards in place at the time. In 2001, a Settlement Agreement was ratified allowing the band to add to the reserve. In addition, band members received $2,000 each, and elders 55 years of age or older received $4,000 apiece.

The cockpit was designed to be left open, but plans for a canopy to enclose it were made available, the use of which would increase the top speed of the aircraft. The Teenie Two was specifically designed to use a converted Volkswagen automobile engine for power. The outer wing panels can be detached for transport or storage. It was featured on the cover of a Popular Mechanics magazine issue in May, 1971. The caption on the cover read, \\"Build a VW-Powered Plane for $750.\\"Popular Mechanics, May 1971 The Teenie Two may be certified in the Experimental category in the US. A pilot license is required to fly it, as it is not considered an ultralight aircraft in the United States. The airplane does however meet the Light Sport Aircraft requirements as defined by the FAA Development Drawing from the experience with his previous design, the Jeanie's Teenie, Calvin Parker set out to refine the popular airplane. Improvements on the Jeanie's Teenie included adoption of a fixed horizontal stabilizer, over the all flying tail of the former machine. The aft fuselage was smoothed to follow a straight line from the cockpit to the tail, an aesthetic change that replaced the older plane's bent back appearance. Fuel capacity was increased as was horsepower, resulting in a heavier but faster airplane. Brakes were added as a requirement, as the lighter Jeanie's Teenie could get by without them. The end product was a smoother, streamlined appearance and better handling. The new airplane was named Teenie Two. Design Teenie Two was conceived as an airplane that could be built using only hand tools, things that would be possessed by the average person in the early 1970s. The philosophy was Keep It Simple. It was intended to be within reach of someone with no previous experience in building an airplane, or in metal work. To this end, the parts are laid out in such a way that they do not require complex jigs or frames of any kind. The materials were also selected because they could be obtained at a typical hardware store of the day. Power is derived from the ubiquitous air- cooled Volkswagen automobile engine with modifications laid out by the designer in the plans. The fuselage is a monocoque design. The empennage consists of a single vertical tail with a hinged rudder. The horizontal stabilizer is fixed, an improvement over Parker's earlier design, the Jeanie's Teenie. A hinged elevator is attached to the horizontal tail. The wings are a fully cantilevered design. The outer wing panels, 6 feet in length each, are detachable to facilitate ground transportation. To simplify construction, each wing rib is a single piece and slides onto the main spar, a technique that helps in rib alignment. The main spar utilizes a special channel that allows the outer wings to flex and minimizes the amount of material required for bracing. The Teenie Two is not equipped with flaps. The landing gear is tubular steel, with automotive valve springs and rubber hose inside, for shock absorption. The landing gear is a fixed tricycle configuration with nose wheel steering through rudder bar deflection. The main gear is designed to fail in the event of excessive stress, thus preventing damage to the wing structure. The wing center section design, makes up part of the main landing gear attachment. The tricycle configuration also eases ground handling. The cockpit is ideally minimal, equipped with instrumentation for simple, day, VFR flying. Aileron and elevator control is affected through use of a side stick. This makes ingress/egress of the tight cockpit simpler and prevents leg movements from imparting motion to the stick inflight. Rudder control is by use of a rudder bar rather than individual pedals, thus reducing complexity. Flight controls are attached and actuated with push rods rather than cables. New designs have the luxury of materials and tools that did not exist or were not readily available to the builders of the 1970s. In principle it is possible to refine older methods, and utilize more diverse materials in construction but the Teenie Two is meant to be built as a minimal airplane, with minimal tools, complexity, skillset, and expense. The Teenie Two is constructed primarily of aluminum, with stainless steel and steel making up the balance. Parts are made from sheet, angle, and tubular stock. The aluminum sheet and extruded angles are limited to two required thicknesses, thus simplifying purchases. Components are fastened using steel mandrel blind rivets of various length. The sheet metal is formed over wooden templates traced from the full sized plans. Very little welding is required, and is generally limited to the landing gear, motor mounts, and small control linkages. The airplane is small enough that it can be built in a garage, on a large table. The aircraft can be built in around 300 hours.Markowski 1979, 232 The flight characteristics of the design were intended to be quick but not oversensitive, for mild aerobatics and handling in rough air. The side stick controller also necessitated full control authority by wrist movement alone. With a fuel capacity of 9 gallons and a typical cruise power setting, the Teenie Two has an endurance of nearly 3 hours. Variants ;Teenie Two :original single-seat version ;Double Teenie :Two-seat version The Teenie Two design was the inspiration for another airplane designed by Gary Watson, called the Watson Windwagon. A redesign of the Watson Windwagon by Morry Hummel, led to the popular Hummelbird airplane. A closer derivative of the Teenie Two optimized for aerobatics, was developed by Bradley Aerospace and called the Bradley Aerobat.

The district has five operating school buildings: three elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school. The district is a member of the Rensselaer-Columbia-Greene Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), known as Questar III. Geography The district serves ten towns in Rensselaer County and encompasses roughly in the towns of Berlin, Brunswick, East Greenbush, Grafton, Nassau, North Greenbush, Poestenkill, Sand Lake, Schodack, and Stephentown. The district is bordered by Brunswick (Brittonkill) Central School District to the north; Berlin Central School District to the east; New Lebanon Central School District to the south; and East Greenbush Central School District, Wynantskill Union Free School District, and The Enlarged City School District of Troy to the west. AdministrationBoard of Education= The Board of Education (BOE) is the authoritative legislative body of the school district. It approves policy and funding; sets committees and district priorities; and approves employment (including the Superintendent) within the district, among other things. The BOE is made up of seven members. Until 2006-07-01, each member served for five years. Members elected after that date now serve three-year terms. The current members of the BOE, with the end of their terms noted in parentheses, are: Peter Schaefer, President (2019) Jessica Zweig, Vice President (2021) Jennie Glasser (2020) Chris Foster (2021) Steven Keller (2019) Ann Morone (2020) Caren Rosch (2019) =Superintendent= Dr. James Franchini is the Superintendent of Schools. The Superintendent is the Chief Administrative Officer of the district and is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the district in addition to administering policies of the Board. Schools The district is served by three elementary schools: Miller Hill, Poestenkill, and West Sand Lake Elementary Schools. The former George Washington and Sand Lake Elementary Schools were closed in June 2010 amid budget difficulties, although the Sand Lake Elementary School's land was kept by the district until January 2015. Algonquin Middle School (grades 6-8), named by student Lori Herman, and Averill Park High School are the lone middle and high schools of the district, respectively. Each building has its own building principal. =Elementary Schools= In the district, there are three elementary schools: Miller Hill Elementary School (Sometimes referred to as Miller Hill-Sand Lake Elementary School; Near State Route 66), West Sand Lake Elementary School (Near the West Sand Lake town center), and Postenkill Elementary School (Near the Postenkill Town Center). There were two former elementary schools that have since shut down due to budget issues: Sand Lake Elementary School (Located next to Miller Hill Elementary school) and George Washington School (Located west of Postenkill). All of the elementary schools teach K-5, however (due to their close proximity) Sand Lake Elementary once taught grades 4-5 while Miller Hill would teach K-3. =Algonquin Middle School= Algonquin Middle School is the only middle school in the entire district. The principal is Mr. Robert Messia as of December 2018. The school was founded in 1967. In the year 2017 the school celebrated 50 years of operation. School-Run ActivitiesSports= The District Offers competitive sports for grades 7 to 12 with levels modified, junior varsity, and Varsity. Sports Include Baseball, Softball, Football, Volleyball, Wrestling, Track and field, Cross country running, Bowling, and Soccer. The district-wide team name is The Warriors.https://www.averillpark.k12.ny.us/programs/athletics =Band, Orchestra, and Chorus= The middle and high school offers Band (i.e., learning a brass, woodwind, or percussion instrument), Orchestra (i.e., learning violin, viola, cello, or double bass), and Chorus (i.e., singing in a choir) while the elementary schools begin instruction in 5th grade. All of the music groups perform concerts. The high school and middle school also offer Jazz Ensemble for more motivated Band students, and the high school offers Treble Choir. Students can be a part of Band and Chorus or Orchestra and Chorus, and although more difficult to schedule, students can be in both Band and Orchestra. =Clubs= The middle and high schools both sponsor school-run clubs. These include the GSA, Debate Club, School Newspaper Club, and others. Clubs are typically run by one teacher or a group of teachers and are sponsored by the school.

The different physical forms and fabrication methods are grouped together in several use forms of explosives. Explosives are sometimes used in their pure forms, but most common applications transform or modify them. These use forms are commonly categorized as: * Pressings * Castings * Polymer bonded * Putties (a.k.a. plastic explosives) * Rubberized * Extrudable * Binary * Blasting agents * Slurries and gels * Dynamites  Castings  Castings, or castable explosives, are explosive materials or mixtures in which at least one component can be safely melted at a temperature which is safe to handle the other components, and which are normally produced by casting or pouring the molten mixture or material into a form or use container. In modern usage, Trinitrotoluene or TNT is the basic meltable explosive used in essentially all castable explosives. Other ingredients found in modern castable explosives include: * Active, energetic or explosive ingredients: ** Aluminum powder ** Ammonium nitrate ** Ammonium picrate ** Barium nitrate ** EDNA ** HMX ** Lead nitrate ** PETN ** Sodium picrate ** RDX ** Tetryl * Inert ingredients ** Boric acid ** Calcium chloride ** Wax ** Silica, often in the form of silica fume (Cab-o-sil for example) Common castable explosives include: * Amatol * Baratol * Boracitol * Composition B * Cyclotol * Octol * Pentolite * Plumbatol * Tritonal * Torpex * IMX-101  Polymer bonded  Polymer-bonded explosives, also known as Plastic- bonded explosives or simply PBX, are a relatively solid and inflexible explosive form containing a powdered explosive material and a polymer (plastic) binder. These are usually carefully mixed, often with a very thin coating of the polymer onto the powder grains of the explosive material, and then hot pressed to form dense solid blocks of PBX material. There are numerous PBX explosives, mostly based on RDX, HMX, or TATB explosive materials. An extensive but by no means complete list of PBX materials is in the main Polymer-bonded explosive article. The major naming systems for PBX use: * LX-# (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed PBXes) * PBX #### (Los Alamos National Laboratory developed PBXes) * PBXN-# (United States Navy developed PBXes) LX numbers range from 1 to 17. PBX system numbers start around 9000 and use numerous scattered numbers between there and 9700. Some commonly known PBXes are: * LX-17 * PBX 9502 * PBX 9404 * LX-11 * LX-14 PBXes are notable for their use in modern Nuclear weapons. Modern US and British nuclear warheads nearly all use insensitive PBX types using only TATB explosive, to increase safety in case of accidents.  Putties, aka Plastic explosives  Technically known as putties, but more commonly Plastic explosives, these mixtures are a thick, flexible, moldable solid material that can be shaped and will retain that shape after forming, much like clay. Putties normally contain mostly RDX explosive, but may include some PETN (Semtex, for example). Some common putties are: * C4 * (Now-obsolete) Composition C * Semtex * PE-4  Rubberized  Rubberized explosives are flat sheets of solid but flexible material, a mixture of a powdered explosive (commonly RDX or PETN) and a synthetic or natural rubber compound. Rubberized sheet explosives are commonly used for explosive welding and for various other industrial and military applications. Rubberized explosives can be cut to specific shape, bent around solid surfaces, glued or taped in place, or simply laid on relatively flat surfaces. Some common rubberized explosives include: * Detasheet - a discontinued DuPont product ** Deta Flex - a DuPont military version of Detasheet ** LX-02-1 - a DuPont Deta Flex variant used by the US Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs * Primasheet - current Ensign- Bickford product line ** Primasheet 1000 - Primasheet 1000 using PETN ** Primasheet 2000 - Primasheet 2000 using RDX  Extrudable  Extrudable explosives are an extremely viscous liquid, similar in properties to silicone based caulking materials used in construction. It is used in similar ways - stored in a container, then extruded out a nozzle into thin cracks, holes, or along surfaces. Some extrudable explosives can then be hardened using a heat curing process. Others will remain a viscous fluid permanently. Common extrudable explosives include: * Setting extrudables ** LX-13 ** XTX-8003 ** XTX-8004 * Non-setting extrudables ** Demex-400  Binary  Binary explosives are cap-sensitive (detonatable with a standard #8 blasting cap) two-part explosives mixtures, shipped separately and combined at the use site. Many of these mixtures are based on Ammonium nitrate as an oxidizer plus a volatile fuel, but unlike ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil explosive) these binaries can be detonated by blasting caps. ANFO requires high explosive boosters to detonate it. Most binary explosives are a slurry after mixing, but some form a fluid with solid components dissolved into liquid ones. Some common binary explosives include: * Kinestik (ammonium nitrate/nitromethane) * Tannerite (ammonium nitrate/aluminum) * Kinepouch * Kinepak * Boulder-Busters * Marine Pac * ASTRO-PAK The historical but now uncommon Astrolite explosive is also a binary explosive. This category is somewhat unusual in that a single explosives researcher, Gerald Hurst, was responsible for inventing and developing most of the explosive mixtures now in use. Astrolite usenet posts archived at Yarchive, accessed 2008-12-28  Blasting agents  Blasting agents are explosive materials or mixtures which are not detonatable by standard #8 blasting caps. The best known blasting agent is ANFO explosive, a mixture containing primarily ammonium nitrate with a small quantity (typically around 6%) of fuel oil, most commonly diesel fuel. Other fuels and additives are used as well. While ANFO is often made on-site using fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate, blasting agents can also be purchased in prepackaged form, usually in metal or cardboard cylinders. Some brand names of packaged blasting agents include: * Nitramon * Nitramite * Pellite * Carbomite * Vibronite * Dynatex * Hydratol * Anoil  Dynamites  It is usually sold in the form of a stick roughly eight inches (20 cm) long and one inch (2.5 cm) in diameter but other sizes also exist. Dynamite is considered a \\"high explosive\\", which means it detonates rather than deflagrates. The chief uses of dynamite used to be in construction, mining and demolition. However, newer explosives and techniques have replaced dynamite in many applications. Dynamite is still used, mainly as bottom charge or in underwater blasting.

Gonzales FAIA (June 11, 1924 ‚Äì November 20, 2008) was an American architect known for a distinctive style of Southwestern architecture which has since been widely copied. Gonzales designed most of Scottsdale, Arizona's, major municipal buildings including Scottsdale City Hall, the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and the Civic Center Library. His resume also included hundreds of private homes and residences throughout Arizona. Examples of Gonzales's work can be found sprinkled across Arizona, the United States and the world. High-profile buildings designed by Gonzales include the Heard Museum in central Phoenix; the Cotton Hotel in Phoenix; the former Armour-Dial building on Scottsdale Road in Scottsdale; and two churches located in Paradise Valley, Arizona, ‚Äì the Gloria Del Lutheran Church and the Christ Church of the Ascension. Gonzales received 131 separate architectural design awards throughout his career, including several awards from the American Institute of Architects. Early life He was born Barnaby Gonzales in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1924. As a child, Gonzales worked at his uncle's adobe brick factory, which produced building materials for the famed Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Gonzales credited Frank Lloyd Wright and Pablo Picasso as his heroes Wooley, Chris (1997) Arizona History maker Honoree Bennie Gonzales, Arizona Architect, documentary film. and he first saw architect Frank Lloyd Wright at the hotel when he was just 8 years old. The brief sighting of Wright made an impression on the young Gonzales, who decided to pursue a career in architecture. Gonzales attended Phoenix Union High School. He enlisted in the United States Coast Guard during World War II. It was during his time in the Coast Guard that he earned the nickname \\"Bennie\\" when a military recruiter decided to call him that instead of his given name, Barnaby. He returned to Arizona following the end of World War II and took a position as a Phoenix firefighter. Gonzales enrolled at Arizona State University's fledgling architecture degree program, eventually becoming one of the program's first two graduates. His one architecture classmate was Frank Henry, who now teaches at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture. Gonzales also studied at the University of Mexico, where he took a particular interest in Mayan design and motifs. Career Scottsdale City Hall, which was designed by Bennie Gonzales. The Heard Museum in Phoenix, designed by Gonzales. A hallmark of Gonzales designs was his minimizing of right angles within his projects. His widespread use of wide angles allowed open space within his architectural designs. He also actively incorporated Southwestern and Arizonan-based cultural elements within his buildings, such as westward facing hogan entrances or patterns based on traditional Navajo rugs. His blending of brad angles and cultural elements produced a distinctive Southwestern style of architecture, which has been widely imitated throughout the region. Gonzales' first commission as an architect was to design the library in Nogales, Arizona. The project earned him an award from the American Institute of Architects. Gonzales' career was at its zenith during the 1960s and 1970s, when he was hired and commissioned to design many of Scottsdale's municipal buildings, which are still in use today. He designed the city of Scottsdale's main library, city hall, and the art complex, which is located across from the Civic Center Plaza. His design for Scottsdale City Hall included a feature called a kiva, which was highly unusual at the time, for public meetings rather than a traditional meeting space. The kiva, which is a Hopi term for an \\"open pit gathering space,\\" was designed by Gonzales to have no walls or doors to separate it from the city hall's offices. Most of the Gonzales-designed public buildings were opened in 1968. Gonzales also designed hundreds of single family homes, multifamily residences and public buildings across Arizona. His home on Palo Christi in Paradise Valley was featured in the February 10, 1967 issue of Life Magazine. Other projects included the hospital in Chinle. Additionally, Gonzales designed numerous buildings throughout the world. One of his most prominent buildings outside of the United States was a $1.5 billion residence, which he designed for the Saudi Royal Family. The residence was constructed by Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman and builder who was the father of Osama bin Laden. Gonzales and his wife, Diane, built their home in Nogales using recycled materials. He focused largely on the new homes in the hills around Nogales during his later career. Death Bennie Gonzales died of Alzheimer's disease at his home in Nogales, Arizona, on November 20, 2008, at the age of 84.

It was inspired by the Bicentennial National Trail opened on the mainland in 1988. It runs from Devonport in the north of the state to Dover in the South East and is 460 km long. It consists of 15 sections. Each section is approximately one day's journey for a horse rider or cyclist. The trail can be hiked, but its use of roads and other vehicle tracks means it is not always appealing to walkers. Many sections end at a town or a dedicated campsite. Campsite quality varies, but the trail co-ordinators aim to create three-sided huts, a water tank, a pit toilet, picnic tables and cleared tent sites at each. The track runs mainly through state forest and other reserves. The trail often leaves valleys to seek ridge lines which then offer many scenic outlooks. The trail commences with a gentle grade on a made road from Devonport which runs beside the Mersey river. It soon enters rougher terrain including the Cluan Tiers, Great Western Tiers and then climbs into the Central Highlands. The trail then passes through Great Lakes region across the highlands to the Derwent River. At New Norfolk the trail leaves the Derwent and climbs over the mountain pass of the old stock route to the Huon River valley using a track around the ‚Äòback‚Äô of Hobart‚Äôs Mount Wellington.

Early life Even at a young age, Drew's interest in music was apparent. When he was five, he was sent home from school for singing Under My Thumb by The Rolling Stones. Later, he quickly picked up drumming when he was twelve and he was often sent home for singing or drumming in class. He played in the band at Admiral Collingwood Public School and various sports such as hockey or wrestling, as well as taking tap dancing lessons for a year. When he was fifteen, he was taught a few chords on the guitar and took it up as his main instrument. Despite being left-handed, Wright plays right-handed. After leaving school, Drew attended Collingwood Collegiate Institute and enrolled in the drama program. He would often bring his guitar to class and play for his peers. For his year-end monologue, he played a character who wanted to write music for a living. Around this time, he played in a band called Clean Dirt, though they broke up shortly thereafter. He then formed a band called Malleus, who won the Rock 95 Loud and Local Contest in 2006. After graduating high school, Drew earned a degree in music engineering and continued to play on the local scene. Canadian Idol Drew was pressured to try out for Canadian Idol by family and friends. As twenty-eight is the cut off age for auditioners, he decided to give it a shot (he was twenty-seven at the time of his audition) and made it to the Top 200. The day of his final performance in Toronto Week, his grandmother died and he contemplated leaving, though decided, with his family's blessing, to stay in the competition. He wowed the judges with his acoustic performance of Maroon 5's She Will Be Loved and made it into the Top 24 (though at the time, it was still a Top 22). After performing Queen's \\"Under Pressure\\", Neverending White Lights's \\"The Grace\\" and Hoobastank's \\"The Reason\\" (the latter which of two, he accompanied himself on guitar), Drew advanced into the Top 10 of Canadian Idol.

History The Sun Theatre originally opened in 1938 as a single-screen cinema seating 1,050 patrons. The Theatre was very popular in the area; it was noted for being the most luxurious cinema in the area and drew large crowds each week. Ticket counters and a booking office were used to handle the crowds. The Sun's original candy location is today known as the Sun Bookshop. A unique feature to the cinema was the pram room, where babies in their prams were placed and given a number. If a baby started crying, its number was flashed on the screen to alert the parents. The Sun's popularity began to dwindle during the 1950s and 60s, largely due to the introduction of television in Australia. In the late 1960s, the Sun was transformed into a Greek theatre to satisfy the growing Greek population of Yarraville. However, the new Greek Theatre was eventually shut down by the Health Department, due to unsanitary carpets. The Sun remained in a derelict condition for 20 years, until it was purchased in 1995 by the current owners. However, years of neglect, graffiti and pilfering had reduced the once modern and sophisticated theatre into little more than four brick walls. The new owners transformed the Sun into one of Melbourne's most popular film societies between 1998 and 2003. Facilities Today, the Sun Theatre seats 700 patrons in eight boutique cinemas. Following its reopening in 1995, the Sun's large auditorium was divided into four cinemas, and another two were added to the rear. All of the new screens have the original architecture of the theatre. A popular feature of the current cinema is the original club seating which has all been fully refurbished with suede upholstery. A coffee table is shared between all seats in each group, which are noted for their ample leg room. The cinemas of the Sun Theatre are all named after closed-down cinemas in Melbourne, in particular Yarraville and the Western suburbs. * Grand, named after the last cinema to close operations in Footscray, is the Sun's largest cinema. * Barkly, named after once famous Footscray cinema, is based on the dress circle of the original Sun. * Trocadero, named after another long-closed cinema in Footscray, this cinema features parts of the original plaster of the Sun. * Lyric, named after the second cinema in Yarraville, this cinema was originally intended to be the private screening room. It now features 33 chairs and 7 lounge chairs with coffee tables. * Davis, named after the cinema's principal benefactor who was a projectionist at the Sun in the 1950s, this cinema features 100 seats and is decorated with memorabilia such as telegrams and the original Wurlitzer organ. * La Scala, named after an Italian cinema in Footscray, this cinema features such luxuries as 52 leather couches and paintings by local artists. * Roxy, the smallest cinema at the Sun, it is one of the cinemas three lounge cinemas and has only 20 available seats with art deco stylings on the walls * St. Georges, named after the closed-down theatre in Yarraville across the train line, the St. Georges is a small cinema with two levels and couch seating. At the entrance is a painting by Wassily Kandinsky titled St. Georges. Trivia * It was the first Melbourne cinema to be constructed with a parabolic floor and pioneered the 'Continental' form of seatinghttp://www.suntheatre.com.au/historical_significance.php * Was opened by Cr. Free, Mayor of Footscray * Much of the Sun Theatre's unique interior suffered decay beyond repair during the 13-year period of its abandonment. The decorative ceiling had collapsed onto a tangled mess of wrought iron chairs, white ants had invaded all timber construction and floorboards, and there were gaping holes in the roof, along with graffiti, rot, and general destruction. The building had been stripped of its ornate doors, skirting and decorative features, walls were collapsing, cracks opening and the sub-floor furnace room was completely submerged. The building was an ashen shell having experienced several fires (believed to be deliberately lit). * The Sun neon sign, which is positioned above the roof of the theatre and which can be seen from many points around Yarraville, has become a Yarraville icon. * The Sun was visited in a surprise visit by Quentin Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell in 2016, because the theatre was one of the select few Australian venues for the roadshow 70mm presentation of The Hateful 8, and Tarantino was impressed by the theatre's attempt to secure a proper 70mm projector just so they could show this film. The trio happened to be in Melbourne promoting the film and thought it would give the audience in attendance a memorable experience. * The Sun was the filming location for some select interior scenes for the 2015 movie The Dressmaker, doubling for the Dungatar Theatre and exploiting its vintage seating for a story set in the 1950s.

The Lake Berryessa Reservoir is at the top left corner. The Vaca Mountains are a mountain range in Napa and Solano Counties, California that is one of the California Coast Ranges. They represent the easternmost of the Inner Coast Ranges in north‚àícentral California, and divide the Suisun Valley on their west, from the Sacramento Valley on their east. Geography The Vaca Mountains are one of the most prominent landmarks of Solano County, with a steep ridge on the east side that rises abruptly or more above the foothills below. The range begins at Suisun Marsh in a broad, low-elevation saddle that also contains the city of Fairfield and Travis Air Force Base, and separates the mountains to the northwest from an outlier of low hills called the Montezuma Hills. The Vaca Mountains then trend to the north and end at Putah Creek Canyon. The average width of the range is about , with an area of that is mostly undeveloped. Mt. Vaca at an elevation is the highest summit, and the high point of Solano County, but the backbone of the range is the Blue Ridge, a prominent ridgetop that maintains an elevation of over for several miles. Where the Blue Ridge seemingly ends abruptly at Putah Creek Canyon, the mountains continue on the north side of the canyon as the Blue Ridge Range, which is topographically and geologically similar to the Vaca Mountains. Because the canyon is difficult to distinguish from most vantage points on the east side, the Vaca and Blue Ridge Mountains present what appears to be a nearly continuous ridge line that defines the west margin of the Sacramento Valley, which is the northern half of the -long Central Valley of California. Climate, ecology and agriculture The Vaca Mountains have a typical California climate with a cool wet season lasting from November to April, followed by a warm dry season. Because the Vacas are the easternmost of the Coast Ranges, they are subject to the \\"rain shadow\\" effect and rainfall is considerably less than in ranges to the west, such as the Mayacamas Mountains, which are closer to the Pacific Ocean. Mean rainfall averages a year, with nearly all rain falling during the wet season. Snow does fall on Mt. Vaca and Blue Ridge during unusually cold winters, but very seldom on the lower slopes. Temperatures range from lows of during the wet season, to highs of over during the dry season. Because almost all rain falls during the wet season, fire danger is particularly high during the hot summers and early fall. The reasonably abundant winter rainfall results in a diverse assemblage of plants, with chaparral stands of chamise (Adenostoma), buckbrush (Ceanothus) and manzanita (Arctostaphylos) on the ridgetops, grasslands with oak trees (Quercus) and poison oak (Toxicodendron) on the slopes, and riparian habitats in canyons with year-round streams. Because of steep topography, the land is largely undeveloped and the native plants undisturbed. However, there is some agriculture in the lower foothills, with wine grapes on the west (Solano County) slopes, and fruit and nut orchards on the east (Yolo County) slopes. Geology Bedrock throughout most of the Vaca Mountains are sedimentary rocks of the Great Valley Sequence that are Cretaceous in age (65-145 ma). These rocks are represented by shale and interbedded sandstone that are thought to have been deposited in a deep-marine setting as submarine fans, sourced by sediment shed during uplift of the ancestral Sierra Nevada. There is also minor conglomerate that may represent the fill of ancient submarine canyons developed at the heads of these fans. Because the sedimentary layers that make up the Vaca Mountains strike parallel to the crest of the range and dip down to east, these strata have eroded to create a steep escarpment on the west side with a much more gentle slope on the east side. There are also isolated outcrops of prominent black basaltic rocks, the Putnam Peak Basalt, in particular near Vacaville in the southern part of the range, at Putnam Peak in the middle part, and in Putah Creek Canyon at the northern terminus. This basalt dates at 15-16 ma, which makes it Miocene in age, so it is much younger than the Great Valley Sequence. It is thought to represent remnants from an ancient volcanic eruption on the east side of the Sierra Nevada of an especially fluid flow of lava that spread across a large part of central California. Water resources A view to the South in the Northern Vaca Mountains. The Canyon in the foreground holds Wildhorse Creek which is one of the few principal streams in this mountain range. Wildhorse Creek (pictured above) eventually drains this section of the Vaca Mountains into Putah Creek below Monticello Dam. The Vaca Mountains contain several perennial streams, the most important being Suisun Creek on the west side, and Putah Creek on the east. The city of Vallejo, California built a dam at the northern end of Suisun Creek in 1926 to create the Lake Curry reservoir, which served as a municipal water supply until 1992 when measured selenium concentrations in the lake exceeded federal standards. The controversial Monticello Dam, Lake Berryessa reservoir, and Putah South Canal - an integrated project with more than 100 times the water storage capacity of Lake Curry - were completed in 1957-1958 on Putah Creek and currently provide irrigation water to many farms, vineyards and orchards. History The original inhabitants of the Vaca Mountains were the Patwin people. The range is named for the Vaca family, after whom the city of Vacaville is also named. The Vacas, along with their partners the Pena family, were among the earliest European settlers in the area, being the original holders of the 1843 Rancho Los Putos land grant from Mexico of that includes most of the southern part of the range. In August 2020, the Hennessey Fire started in the Vaca Mountains near Lake Hennessey. The fire destroyed over in five counties.

He also played one cricket match for Hampshire County Cricket Club. Football career McGibbon was born in Portsmouth, and joined the Royal Engineers, reaching the rank of sergeant. While serving at the Royal Garrison Artillery at Woolwich he came to the attention of Woolwich Arsenal, whom he joined in August 1905. He failed to get into the first team and after a spell with Eltham, he joined New Brompton in 1907. New Brompton (now Gillingham) were playing in the Southern League under the management of former England international Stephen Smith, who was also team captain. In McGibbon's season at the club, New Brompton finished bottom of the table, avoiding relegation only due to the expansion of the league, but did achieve an FA Cup victory over First Division Sunderland, in which McGibbon scored a hat-trick. McGibbon had previously scored a hat-trick in the 6‚Äì0 victory over Shepherds Bush in the fifth qualifying round. In the first round match, played at Priestfield Stadium on 11 January 1908, Sunderland took the lead after half an hour from England international George Holley. New Brompton equalized immediately with a header from McGibbon, who followed up with two second-half goals to claim a 3‚Äì1 victory. In the second round, New Brompton came up against Manchester City, then third in the Football League First Division. McGibbon scored in the first match, which ended 1‚Äì1, and again in the replay (from a penalty) but was unable to prevent the Football League club from claiming a 2‚Äì1 victory. McGibbon ended the 1907‚Äì08 season as New Brompton's top scorer with 22 goals from all competitions. McGibbon played for Southern League Crystal Palace in the 1908‚Äì09 season, scoring a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì4 draw with Southampton at The Dell on 5 October 1908. This brought him to the attention of the Southampton directors, and when McGibbon's military duties took him to Portsmouth, he joined Southampton in May 1909. Described as \\"physically well-suited for the role of centre-forward\\", McGibbon possessed a \\"powerful shot (and) influential leadership qualities\\". His opportunism in front of goal enabled him to score 19 goals in 28 league goals in the 1909‚Äì10 season, making him the \\"Saints'\\" top-scorer for the season. In March 1910, his military duties took him back to Woolwich and he immediately found a place in a struggling Woolwich Arsenal team that was fighting relegation. He made his debut away to Chelsea on 28 March 1910 and scored the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win. He followed that up with the winner in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Aston Villa and the equaliser in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur. His three goals from four appearances helped Arsenal avoid relegation from the Football League First Division, by a margin of two points above Chelsea. At the start of the following season, McGibbon moved on to join Leyton. After a spell at Reading, McGibbon returned to Southampton in November 1911, but failed to get back into the first team. Later career After the First World War, McGibbon found employment as the Chief Clerk in the Statistical Office at Netley Hospital and later worked for Supermarine at Woolston, Southampton. He made one first-class appearance for Hampshire in July 1919, bowling one over and scoring one run in a County Championship match against Yorkshire. His son, Douglas (1919‚Äì2002), played football for Southampton from 1938 to 1947, as well as for Fulham and Bournemouth.

In 1946, he became the first Liberian journalist to be imprisoned by President William Tubman. The first major movement toward civil society in Liberia is traced back to Porte's activities.J. Peter Pham, \\"Liberia and Sierra Leone: A Study of Comparative Human Rights Approaches by Civil Society Actors\\", James Madison University, Nelson Institute, 2006, p. 11. Background Descended from Barbadians who emigrated to Liberia in 1865, Porte was born on January 16, 1906, in Crozerville, Liberia. The Porte family is from Barbados. He was educated at the Christ Church Parish Day School in Crozerville, the College of West Africa in Monrovia, and Cuttington University College. Before his political journalism career, Porte was a public school teacher. He later served as executive secretary of the National Teachers Association, and edited the NTA Bulletin. Porte's political activist career began in the 1920s when he distributed pamphlets that took the True Whig Party single-party-state government to task for alleged unconstitutional use of presidential power. He published articles in the Crozerville Observer, as well as other Liberian print media and foreign press. His most famous publications are the leaflets and pamphlets Thinking about Unthinkable Things‚ÄîThe Democratic Way (1967), Liberianization or Gobbling Business? (1975), Explaining Why (1976), Thoughts on Change (1977) and The Day Monrovia Stood Still (1979). Porte was imprisoned multiple times, and harassed and hounded by the government from the 1920s. In the 1970s, Porte took aim at Finance Minister Stephen Allen Tolbert, the brother of President William Tolbert and co-founder of the first Liberian- owned multimillion-dollar conglomerate, the Mesurado Group of Companies. He accused the minister of using his public office stature to advance his business interests, penning a piece called \\"Liberianization of Gobbling Business?\\" Minister Tolbert filed a libel lawsuit and won a US$250,000 judgment against Porte in a case presided over by Supreme Court Justice James A. A. Pierre, the father-in-law of Minister Tolbert. The resulting public outrage led to the creation of what is considered Liberia's first civil society organization, Citizens of Liberia in Defense of Albert Porte (COLIDAP). Porte died in 1986. On July 24, 2008, Porte posthumously received the Knight Great Band Humane Order of Africa Redemption award from the Liberian government for his contributions to Liberia. He was the uncle of Kenneth Best, the founder of the Liberian Observer, one of the oldest extant daily newspapers in Liberia.

On August 31st, \\"Poli\\" was released by Zo√© as the third single off the album, via Myspace.

According to the US Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA), besides HIV/AIDS, issues related to LGBT health include breast and cervical cancer, hepatitis, mental health, substance abuse, tobacco use, depression, access to care for transgender persons, issues surrounding marriage and family recognition, conversion therapy, refusal clause legislation, and laws that are intended to \\"immunize health care professionals from liability for discriminating against persons of whom they disapprove.\\" LGBT people may face barriers to accessing healthcare on the basis of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression. Many avoid or delay care or receive inappropriate or inferior care because of perceived or real homophobia or transphobia and discrimination by health care providers and institutions; in other words, negative personal experience, the assumption or expectation of negative experience based on knowing of history of such experience in other LGBT people, or both. It is often pointed out that the reason of this is heterosexism in medical care and research:[Heterosexism in Health and Social Care, Julie Fish, 2006] > \\"Heterosexism can be purposeful (decreased funding or support of research > projects that focus on sexual orientation) or unconscious (demographic > questions on intake forms that ask the respondent to rate herself or himself > as married, divorced, or single). These forms of discrimination limit > medical research and negatively impact the health care of LGB individuals. > This disparity is particularly extreme for lesbians (compared to homosexual > men) because they have a double minority status, and experience oppression > for being both female and homosexual.\\" Especially with lesbian patients, they may be discriminated in three ways: # Homophobic attitudes; # Heterosexist judgements and behaviour; # General sexism ‚Äì focusing primarily on male health concerns and services; assigning subordinate to that of men health roles for women, as for service providers and service recipients. Issues affecting LGBT people generally Research from the UK indicates that there appears to be limited evidence available from which to draw general conclusions about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender health because epidemiological studies have not incorporated sexuality as a factor in data collection. Review of research that has been undertaken suggests that there are no differences in terms of major health problems between LGBT people and the general population, although LGBT people generally appear to experience poorer health, with no information on common and major diseases, cancers or long-term health. Mental health appears worse among LGBT people than among the general population, with depression, anxiety and suicide ideation being 2‚Äì3 times higher than the general population. There appear to be higher rates of eating disorder and self-harm, but similar levels of obesity and domestic violence to the general population; lack of exercise and smoking appear more significant and drug use higher, while alcohol consumption is similar to the general population. Polycystic ovaries and infertility were identified as being more common amongst lesbians than heterosexual women. The research indicates noticeable barriers between LGB patients and health professionals, and the reasons suggested are homophobia, assumptions of heterosexuality, lack of knowledge, misunderstanding and over-caution; institutional barriers were identified as well, due to assumed heterosexuality, inappropriate referrals, lack of patient confidentiality, discontinuity of care, absence of LGBT-specific healthcare, lack of relevant psycho-sexual training. About 30 percent of all completed suicides have been related to sexual identity crisis. Students who also fall into the gay, bisexual, lesbian or trans gendered identity groups report being five times as more likely to miss school because they feel unsafe after being bullied due to their sexual orientation. Research points to issues encountered from an early age, such as LGBT people being targeted for bullying, assault, and discrimination, as contributing significantly to depression, suicide and other mental health issues in adulthood.Rates and predictors of mental illness in gay men, lesbians and bisexual men and women, British Journal of Psychiatry, (2004) 185: 479-485 Social research suggests that LGBT experience discriminatory practices in accessing healthcare. One way that LGB individuals have attempted to deal with discriminatory health care is by seeking \\"queer- friendly\\" health care providers  Causes of LGBT health disparities  Some causes of lack of access to healthcare among LGBT people are: perceived or real discrimination, inequality in the workplace and health insurance sectors, and lack of competent care due to negligible LGBT health training in medical schools. Healthcare professionals that have little to no knowledge about the LGBT community can result in a lack of or a decline in the type of healthcare these families receive. \\"Fundamentally, the distinctive healthcare needs of lesbian women go unnoticed, are deemed unimportant or are simply ignored\\" (DeBold, 2007; Weisz, 2009). This citation is from the article Marginalised mothers: Lesbian women negotiating heteronormative healthcare services, which talks about how heteronormative rhetorics affect the way lesbian couples are viewed. Views like these lead to the belief that health care training can exclude the topic related to the healthcare of LGBT and make certain members of the LGBT community feel as though they can be exempt from healthcare without any bodily consequences. An upstream issue is the relative lack of official data on gender identity that health policy makers could use to plan, cost, implement and evaluate health policies and programs to improve transgender population health. The 'What We Know Project' reviewed thousands of peer-reviewed studies and found a strong link between discrimination and harm to the health of LGBT people. The findings showed that the presence of discrimination, stigma and prejudice creates a hostile social climate which increase the risk of poor mental and physical health, even for those not directly exposed to the discrimination. This creates a situation known as 'minority stress' which includes low self-esteem and expectations, fear of discrimination and internalised stigma - which all contribute to health disparities.  LGBT health and social support networks  LGBT health outcomes are strongly influenced by social support networks, peers, and family. One example of a support network now available to some LGBT youth include Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs), which are clubs that work to improve the climate for LGBT youth at schools and educate students and staff about issues faced by the LGBT community. In order to investigate the effects of GSAs on LGBT youth, 149 college-aged students that self-identified as LGBT completed a survey that assessed their high school‚Äôs climate for LGBT youth, and their current health and alcohol dependency outcomes. Those participants who had a GSA at their high school (GSA+ youth) reported higher senses of belonging, less at-school victimization because of their sexual orientation, more favorable outcomes related to their alcohol use behaviors, and greater positive outcomes related to depression and general psychological distress when compared to those without a GSA (GSA- youth). Amongst other competing variables that contributed to these outcomes, the vast majority of schools that had a GSA were located in urban and suburban areas that tend to be safer and more accepting of LGBT people in general. Family and social support networks also relate with mental health trajectories amongst LGBT youth. Family rejection upon a youth ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù sometimes results in adverse health outcomes. In fact, LGBT youth who experienced family rejection were 8.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, 5.9 times more likely to experience elevated levels of depression, and 3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs than those LGBT youth who were accepted by family members. Family rejection sometimes leads youth to either run away from home or be kicked out of their home, which relates to the high rate of homelessness experienced by LGBT youth. In turn, homelessness relates to an array of adverse health outcomes that sometimes stem from homeless LGBT youths‚Äô elevated rates of involvement in prostitution and survival sex. One longitudinal study of 248 youth across 5.5 years found that LGBT youth that have strong family and peer support experience less distress across all time points relative to those who have uniformly low family and peer support. Overtime, the psychological distress experienced by LGBT youth decreased, regardless of the amount of family and peer support that they received during adolescence. Nonetheless, the decrease in distress was greater for youth with low peer and family support than for those participants with high support. At age 17, those who lacked family support but had high peer support exhibited the highest levels of distress, but this distress level lowered to nearly the same level as those reporting high levels of support within a few years. Those LGBT youth without family support but with strong support from their peers reported an increase in family support over the years in spite of having reported the lowest family support at the age of 17. Similarly, another study of 232 LGBT youth between the ages of 16-20 found that those with low family and social support reported higher rates of hopelessness, loneliness, depression, anxiety, somatization, suicidality, global severity, and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) than those who received strong family and non-family support. In contrast, those who solely received non-family support reported worse outcomes for all measured health outcomes except for anxiety and hopelessness, for which there was no difference. Some studies have found poorer mental health outcomes for bisexual people than gay men and lesbians, which has been attributed to some degree to this community‚Äôs lack of acceptance and validation both within and outside of the LGBT community. One qualitative study interviewed 55 bisexual people in order to identify common reasons for higher rates of mental health problems. The testimonials that were collected and organized into macro level (social structure), meso level (interpersonal), and micro level (individual) factors. At the social structure level, bisexuals noted that they were constantly asked to explain and justify their sexual orientation, and experienced biphobia and monosexism from individuals both within and outside of the LGBT community. Many also stated that their identity was repetitively degraded by others, and that they are assumed to be promiscuous and hypersexual. During dates with others that did not identify as bisexual, some sighted being attacked and rejected solely based their sexual orientation. One female bisexual participant stated that upon going on a date with a lesbian female, ‚Äú...she was very anti-bisexual. She said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre sitting on the fence. Make a choice, either you‚Äôre gay or straight‚Äô‚Äù (p. 498). Family members similarly questioned and criticized their identity. One participant recalled that his sister stated that she would prefer if her sibling were gay instead of ‚Äú...this slutty person who just sleeps with everyone‚Äù (p. 498). At the personal level, many bisexual struggle to accept themselves due to society‚Äôs negative social attitudes and beliefs about bisexuality. In order to address issues of self acceptance, participants recommended embracing spirituality, exercise, the arts, and other activities that promote emotional health. Issues affecting lesbiansBreast cancer= According to Katherine A. O‚ÄôHanlan, lesbians \\"have the richest concentration of risk factors for breast cancer [of any] subset of women in the world.\\" Additionally, many lesbians do not get routine mammograms, do breast self-exams, or have clinical breast exams. There are also policy documents from both the UK and US Government that stated there could be higher rates of breast cancer among lesbian and bisexual women despite insufficient evidence. In a 2009 report by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Cancer's Inquiry into Inequalities in Cancer, it was stated that \\"Lesbians may have a higher risk of breast cancer.2009 Report of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Cancer's Inquiry into Inequalities in Cancer =Depression and anxiety= Depression and anxiety are thought to affect lesbians at a higher rate than in the general population, for similar reasons. =Domestic violence= Domestic violence is reported to occur in about 11 percent of lesbian homes. While this rate is about half the rate of 20 percent reported by heterosexual women, lesbians often have fewer resources available for shelter and counselling. = Obesity and fitness = Lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to be overweight or obese.Struble CB, Lindley LL, Montgomery K, et al. Overweight and obesity in lesbian and bisexual college women. J Am College Health. 2010;59(1):51-6. Research shows that on average lesbians have a higher body mass index than heterosexual women. =Substance abuse= Lesbians often have high rates of substance use, including recreational drugs, alcohol and tobacco. Studies have shown that lesbian and bisexual women are 200% more likely to smoke tobacco than other women. = Reproductive and sexual health = Lesbian, bisexual, and queer women have many of the same reproductive and sexual health needs as heterosexual women. However, queer women face disparities when it comes to reproductive and sexual health. This may be in part due to lower socioeconomic status and lower rates of insurance, particularly for bisexual individuals. Additionally, sex education (in the U.S.) is largely heteronormative and may not provide information relevant for LGBTQ individuals (see LGBT sex education). Health care providers may not have adequate education regarding sexual orientation, so may not be offering their queer patients appropriate and needed services. Queer individuals may also face discrimination and bias in the health care setting (and in society more broadly), leading to lower quality health care or deterring individuals from seeking care at all. Given these factors, queer women have specific needs around reproductive and sexual health.  Cervical cancer  A lack of screening for cervical cancer is among the most obvious and most preventable risk factor for lesbians, bisexual, and queer women in the development of invasive late-stage cervical cancer. Lesbian, bisexual, and queer women are less likely to receive appropriate screening for cervical cancer than heterosexual women, which leads to later detection of cervical cancer.  Contraception  Lesbian, bisexual, and queer women need access to contraception, both to prevent pregnancy and for a variety of non-contraceptive benefits. Estimates suggest that 3.8 million cisgender lesbian, bisexual and queer women may be using contraceptives in the United States. However, lesbian, bisexual, and queer women are less likely to use contraceptive methods, even when they are engaging in sex that could result in pregnancy.  Abortion  Lesbian, bisexual, queer, and women who identify with a sexual minority identity seek abortion care. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that approximately 5% of abortion patients in the United States identify as lesbian, bisexual, or queer. Studies relying on measures of self-reported abortions suggest that abortion is common across queer women‚Äôs lives. Bisexual adolescents are more likely to terminate a pregnancy than their heterosexual counterparts, a difference that persists into adulthood. Across their lifetimes, women who identify with a sexual minority identity were more likely than heterosexual women to experience an unwanted pregnancy or terminate a pregnancy. Issues affecting gay menDepression, anxiety, and suicide= Studies by Cochran et al. (2003) and Mills et al. (2004), among others, suggest that depression and anxiety appear to affect gay men at a higher rate than in the general population. According to GLMA, \\"the problem may be more severe for those men who remain in the closet or who do not have adequate social supports. Adolescents and young adults may be at particularly high risk of suicide because of these concerns. Culturally sensitive mental health services targeted specifically at gay men may be more effective in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of these conditions.\\" Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco found that major risk factors for depression in gay and bisexual men included a recent experience of anti-gay violence or threats, not identifying as gay, or feeling alienated from the gay community. Results from a survey by Stonewall Scotland published in early 2012 found that 3% of gay men had attempted suicide within the past year. Despite progress in LGBT rights globally, gay men continue to experience high rates of loneliness and depression after coming out. Suicide rates among men in same- sex relationships fell significantly in Sweden and Denmark after the legalization of same-sex marriage. Researcher Annette Erlangsen suggested that along with other gay rights legislation, same-sex marriage may have reduced feelings of social stigmatization among some homosexual people and that ‚Äúbeing married is protective against suicide\\". = HIV/AIDS = Men who have sex with men are more likely to acquire HIV in the modern West, Japan, India, and Taiwan, Increased Risk for Entamoeba histolytica Infection and Invasive Amebiasis in HIV Seropositive Men Who Have Sex with Men in Taiwan as well as other developed countries than among the general population,UNAIDS 2006 report on the global AIDS epidemic, Chapter 05, June 2006 in the United States, 60 times more likely than the general population. An estimated 62% of adult and adolescent American males living with HIV/AIDS got it through sexual contact with other men.Estimated numbers of persons living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2006, by race/ethnicity, sex, and transmission category‚Äî33 states with confidential name-based HIV infection reporting , Center for Disease and Control Prevention HIV-related stigma is consistently and significantly associated with poorer physical and mental health in PLHIV (people living with HIV). The first name proposed for what is now known as AIDS was gay-related immune deficiency, or GRID.\\"The History of AIDS and ARC\\" at the LSU Law Center This name was proposed in 1982, after public health scientists noticed clusters of Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis pneumonia among gay males in California and New York City. =Other sexually transmitted infections= The US Center for Disease Control recommends annual screening for syphilis, gonorrhea, HIV and chlamydia for men who have sex with men. Black gay men have a greater risk of HIV and other STIs than white gay men. However, their reported rates of unprotected anal intercourse are similar to those of men who have sex with men (MSM) of other ethnicities. Men who have sex with men are at an increased risk for hepatitis, and immunization for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B is recommended for all men who have sex with men. Safer sex is currently the only means of prevention for the Hepatitis C. Human papilloma virus, which causes anal and genital warts, plays a role in the increased rates of anal cancers in gay men, and some health professionals now recommend routine screening with anal pap smears to detect early cancers. Men have higher prevalence of oral HPV than women. Oral HPV infection is associated with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. =Eating disorders and body image= Gay men are more likely than straight men to suffer from eating disorders such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa. The cause of this correlation remains poorly understood, but is hypothesized to be related to the ideals of body image prevalent in the LGBT community. Obesity, on the other hand, affects relatively fewer gay and bisexual men than straight men =Substance abuse= David McDowell of Columbia University, who has studied substance abuse in gay men, wrote that club drugs are particularly popular at gay bars and circuit parties.Addictions in the Gay and Lesbian Community, Jeffrey R. Guss, Jack Drescher, Published by Haworth Press, 2000, , Studies have found different results on the frequency of tobacco use among gay and bisexual men compared to that of heterosexual men, with one study finding a 50% higher rate among sexual minority men, and another encountering no differences across sexual orientations. = Gay life expectancy = A Danish study published in 2013 found that married gay men had a life expectancy similar to that of married heterosexual men. Lead researcher Morten Frisch stating \\"among men in Denmark, it is more dangerous to be unmarried or divorced than to be married to another man\\". A U.S. based longitudinal study published in 2011 reported that mortality risk from non‚ÄìHIV-related causes, including suicide, was not elevated among men who have sex with men (MSM), but mortality risk was higher for those living with HIV. Researcher Annette Erlangsen says that along with other gay rights legislation, same-sex marriage may have reduced feelings of social stigmatization among some homosexual people and that ‚Äúbeing married is protective against suicide\\". Since the 1990s, false statistics have circulated claiming that gay men have a significantly shorter life expectancy ‚Äì originating from publications by Paul Cameron, who has been described as an anti-gay extremist. Cameron was expelled from the American Psychological Association in 1983. Cameron's research on life expectancy was described as \\"pseudoscientific\\" by epidemiologist Morten Frisch in The Christian Post, who said that the \\"methodological flaws are of such a grave nature that no decent peer-reviewed scientific journal should let it pass for publication\\", and was similarly criticised by Nick Eberstadt at the American Enterprise Institute. Issues affecting bisexual people Typically, bisexual individuals and their health and well-being are not studied independently of lesbian and gay individuals. Thus, there is limited research on the health issues that affect bisexual individuals. However, the research that has been done has found striking disparities between bisexuals and heterosexuals, and even between bisexuals and homosexuals. It is important to consider that the majority of bisexual individuals are well-adjusted and healthy, despite having higher instances of health issues than the heterosexual population. =Body image and eating disorders= Youth who reported having sex with both males and females are at the greatest risk for disordered eating, unhealthy weight control practices compared to youth who only have same- or other-gender sex. Bisexual women are twice as likely as lesbians to have an eating disorder and, if they are out, to be twice as likely as heterosexual women to have an eating disorder. =Mental health and suicide= Bisexual females are higher on suicidal intent, mental health difficulties and mental health treatment than bisexual males. In a survey by Stonewall Scotland, 7% of bisexual men had attempted suicide in the past year. Bisexual women are twice as likely as heterosexual women to report suicidal ideation if they have disclosed their sexual orientation to a majority of individuals in their lives; those who are not disclosed are three times more likely. Bisexual individuals have a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts than heterosexual individuals, and more self-injurious behavior than gay men and lesbians. A 2011 survey found that 44 per cent of bisexual middle and high school students had thought about suicide in the past month. =Substance abuse= Female adolescents who report relationships with same- and other-sex partners have higher rates of alcohol abuse and substance abuse. This includes higher rates of marijuana and other illicit drug use. Behaviorally and self-identified bisexual women are significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes and have been drug users as adolescents than heterosexual women. =Cancer= Bisexual women are more likely to be nulliparous, overweight and obese, have higher smoking rates and alcohol drinking than heterosexual women, all risk factors for breast cancer. Bisexual men practicing receptive anal intercourse are at higher risk for anal cancer caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). =HIV/AIDS and sexual health= Most research on HIV/AIDS focuses on gay and bisexual men than lesbians and bisexual women. Evidence for risky sexual behavior in bisexually behaving men has been conflicted. Bisexually active men have been shown to be just as likely as gay or heterosexual men to use condoms. Men who have sex with men and women are less likely than homosexually behaving men to be HIV- positive or engage in unprotected receptive anal sex, but more likely than heterosexually behaving men to be HIV-positive. Although there are no confirmed cases of HIV transmitted from female to female, women who have sex with both men and women have higher rates of HIV than homosexual or heterosexual women. In a 2011 nationwide study in the United States, 46.1% of bisexual women reported having experienced rape, compared to 13.1% of lesbians and 17.4% of heterosexual women, Pdf. a risk factor for HIV.  Pregnancy healthcare for lesbian women  There have been several studies that discuss healthcare experiences of pregnant lesbian women. Larsson and Dykes conducted a study in 2009 about lesbian mothers in Sweden. The participants wanted their healthcare providers to confirm and recognize both parents, not just the biological mother. They also wanted their healthcare providers to ask questions about their \\"life styles\\" to demonstrate their openness about sexuality. Most of the women in the study commented that they had good experiences with healthcare. However, birth education tended to focus on mother and father dynamics. The forms that were also used tended to be heterosexist (see Heterosexism), only allowing for mother and father identities. To account for these differences, Singer created a document about how to improve the prenatal care of lesbian women in the United States. She found that curiosity about a patient's sexuality can take over an appointment, sometimes placing the patient into a situation where they end up educating the provider. To be inclusive, Singer recommended that healthcare providers should be more inclusive in their opening discussions by saying \\"So tell me the story of how you became pregnant\\". Healthcare providers should, according to Singer, use inclusive language that can be used for all types of patients. Healthcare providers were also not aware of how much reproductive health care cost for lesbian couples and they should openly recognize this issue with their lesbian patients. Pharris, Bucchio, Dotson, and Davidson also provided suggestions on how to support lesbian couples during pregnancy. Childbirth educators should avoid assuming that parents are heterosexual or straight couples. They recommend using neutral language when discussing parent preferences. Forms, applications, and other distributed information should be inclusive of lesbian parents. They suggest using terms such as \\"non-biological mother, co-parent, social mother, other mother and second female parent\\" are good examples. Asking parents was also a suggested way to figure out what term should be used. Parents may also need help navigating legal systems in the area. Midwife(wives) and Doula(s) have provided care for lesbian women and couples who are pregnant. In an article in Rewire News, there was a discussion of how midwives and doulas are attempting to improve the overall care of lesbian couples by having specific training based on providing care to these couples as well as having inclusive processes. In a study of lesbian and bisexual women in Canada about using healthcare services, researchers Ross, Steele, and Epstein found that the women in the study loved working with doulas and midwives. Midwives were considered helpful advocates with other healthcare providers that they encountered. Midwives also discuss their perspectives. R√∂ndahl, Bruhner, and Lindhe conducted a study in 2009 about lesbian pregnancy experiences of women in Norway. They found that midwives were the ones who were responsible for creating a space to discuss sexuality. However, midwives in the study felt that they were inadequate about having the communication tools to create this space. Additionally, the researchers found that lesbian couples were seen as different compared to straight couples. The partners have a sense of both love and friendship. Their differences were also seen when trying to find the roles for the lesbian co-mothers (non-biological mothers), as the language and questions asked did not fit their roles. Finally, the researchers found that there needed to be a balance of asking questions and being overly assertive. Midwives could ask questions about the patients' sexuality, but asking too many questions caused discomfort in the patients. Issues affecting transgender peopleAccess to health care= The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care provide a set of non-binding clinical guidelines for health practitioners who are treating transgender patients. The Yogyakarta Principles, a global human rights proposal, affirms in Principle 17 that \\"States shall (g) facilitate access by those seeking body modifications related to gender reassignment to competent, non-discriminatory treatment, care and support.The Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 17. The Rights to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health Transgender individuals are often reluctant to seek medical care or are denied access by providers due to transphobia/homophobia or a lack of knowledge or experience with transgender health. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, health care related to transgender issues, especially sex reassignment therapy, is not covered by medical insurance. In the UK, the NHS is legally required to provide treatment for gender dysphoria. As of 2018, Wales refers patients to the Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) in London, but the Welsh government plans to open a gender identity clinic in Cardiff. In India, a 2004 report claimed that hijras 'face discrimination in various ways' in the Indian health-care system, and sexual reassignment surgery is unavailable in government hospitals in India. In Bangladesh, health facilities sensitive to hijra culture are virtually non-existent, according to a report on hijra social exclusion. =Denial of health care in the United States= The 2008-2009 National Transgender Discrimination Survey, published by National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality in partnership with the National Black Justice Coalition,National Transgender Discrimination Survey shed light on the discrimination transgender and gender non-conforming people face in many aspects of daily life, including in medical and health care settings. The survey reported that 19% of respondents had been refused healthcare by a doctor or other provider because they identify as transgender or gender non-conforming and transgender people of color were more likely to have been refused healthcare. 36% of American Indian and 27% of multi-racial respondents reported being refused healthcare, compared to 17% of white respondents. In addition, the survey found that 28% of respondents said they had been verbally harassed in a healthcare setting and 2% of respondents reported being physically attacked in a doctor's office. Transgender people particularly vulnerable to being assaulted in a doctor's office were those who identify as African-Americans (6%), those who engaged in sex work, drug sales or other underground work (6%), those who transitioned before they were 18 (5%), and those who identified as undocumented or non-citizens (4%). An updated version of the NTDS survey, called the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, was published in December 2016. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act contains nondiscrimination provisions to protect transgender people. In December 2016, however, a federal judge issued an injunction to block the enforcement of \\"the portion of the Final Rule that interprets discrimination on the basis of 'gender identity' and 'termination of pregnancy'\\". Under the Trump administration, Roger Severino was appointed as civil rights director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Severino opposes Section 1557 and HHS has said it \\"will not investigate complaints about anti- transgender discrimination,\\" as explained by the National Center for Transgender Equality. When a journalist asked Severino if, under the HHS Conscience and Religious Freedom division whose creation was announced in January 2018, transgender people could be \\"denied health care,\\" he said \\"I think denial is a very strong word\\" and that healthcare \\"providers who simply want to serve the people they serve according to their religious beliefs\\" should be able to do so without fear of losing federal funding. On May 24, 2019, Severino announced a proposal to reverse this portion of Section 1557, and, as of April 23, 2020, the Justice Department was reportedly reviewing the Trump administration's \\"final rule\\" which HHS acknowledged would reverse Section 1557's gender identity protections. On April 2, 2019, Texas Senate Bill 17 passed by a vote of 19-12. It would allow state-licensed professionals such as doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, and plumbers to deny services to anyone if the professional cites a religious objection. To reveal the motivations behind the bill, opponents proposed an amendment to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity; the amendment failed 12-19. On October 15, 2019, federal judge Reed O'Connor vacated the part of the Affordable Care Act that protects transgender people. The ruling means that federally-funded healthcare insurers and providers may deny treatment or coverage based on sex, gender identity or termination of pregnancy, and that doctors aren't required to provide any services whatsoever to transgender people‚Äîeven if they're the same services provided to non-transgender people, and even if they're medically necessary. =Insurance coverage= Although they are not the only uninsured population in the United States, transgender people are less likely than cisgender people to have access to health insurance and if they do, their insurance plan may not cover medically necessary services. The National Transgender Discrimination Survey reported that 19% of survey respondents stated that they had no health insurance compared to 15% of the general population. They were also less likely to be insured by an employer. Undocumented non-citizens had particularly high rates of non-coverage (36%) as well as African-Americans (31%), compared to white respondents (17%). While a majority of U.S. insurance policies expressly exclude coverage for transgender care, regulations are shifting to expand coverage of transgender and gender non-conforming health care. A number of private insurance carriers cover transgender-related health care under the rubric of \\"transgender services\\", \\"medical and surgical treatment of gender identity disorder\\", and \\"gender reassignment surgery\\". Nine states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) and the District of Columbia require that most private insurance plans cover medically necessary health care for transgender patients. Depending on where they live, some transgender people are able to access gender-specific health care through public health insurance programs. Medicaid does not have a federal policy on transgender health care and leaves the regulation of the coverage of gender-confirming health care up to each state. While Medicaid does not fund sex reassignment surgery in forty states, several, like New York and Oregon, now require Medicaid to cover (most) transgender care. =Cancer= Cancers related to hormone use include breast cancer and liver cancer. In addition, trans men who have not had removal of the uterus, ovaries, or breasts remain at risk to develop cancer of these organs, but trans women remain at risk for prostate cancer. =Mental health= According to transgender advocate Rebecca Allison, trans people are \\"particularly prone\\" to depression and anxiety: \\"In addition to loss of family and friends, they face job stress and the risk of unemployment. Trans people who have not transitioned and remain in their birth gender are very prone to depression and anxiety. Suicide is a risk, both prior to transition and afterward. One of the most important aspects of the transgender therapy relationship is management of depression and/or anxiety.\\" Depression is significantly correlated with experienced discrimination. In a study of San Francisco trans women, 62% reported depression. In a 2003 study of 1093 trans men and trans women, there was a prevalence of 44.1% for clinical depression and 33.2% for anxiety. Suicide attempts are common in transgender people. In some transgender populations the majority have attempted suicide at least once. 41% of the respondents of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey reported having attempted suicide. This statistic was even higher for certain demographics ‚Äì for example, 56% of American Indian and Alaskan Native transgender respondents had attempted suicide. In contrast, 1.6% of the American population has attempted suicide. In the sample all minority ethnic groups (Asian, Latino, black, American Indian and mixed race) had higher prevalence of suicide attempts than white people. Number of suicide attempts was also correlated with life challenges - 64% of those surveyed who had been sexually assaulted had attempted suicide. 76% who had been assaulted by teachers or other school staff had made an attempt. In 2012 the Scottish Transgender Alliance conducted the Trans Mental Health Study. 74% of the respondents who had transitioned reported improved mental health after transitioning. 53% had self-harmed at some point, and 11% currently self- harmed. 55% had been diagnosed with or had a current diagnosis of depression. An additional 33% believed that they currently had depression, or had done in the past, but had not been diagnosed. 5% had a current or past eating disorder diagnosis. 19% believed that they had suffered from an eating disorder or currently had one, but had not been diagnosed. 84% of the sample had experienced suicide ideation and 48% had made a suicide attempt. 3% had attempted suicide more than 10 times. 63% of respondents who transitioned thought about and attempted suicide less after transitioning. Other studies have found similar results. Trans women appear to be at greater risk than trans men and the general population of dying of suicide. However, trans men are more likely to attempt suicide than trans women. Personality disorders are common in transgender people. Gender identity disorder is currently classed as a psychiatric condition by the DSM IV-TR. The upcoming DSM-5 removes GID and replaces it with 'gender dysphoria', which is not classified by some authorities as a mental illness. Until the 1970s, psychotherapy was the primary treatment for GID. However, today the treatment protocol involves biomedical interventions, with psychotherapy on its own being unusual. There has been controversy about the inclusion of transsexuality in the DSM, one claim being that Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood was introduced to the DSM-III in 1980 as a 'backdoor-maneuver' to replace homosexuality, which was removed from the DSM-II in 1973. =Hormones= Transgender individuals frequently take hormones to achieve feminizing or masculinizing effects. Side effects of hormone use include increased risk of blood clotting, high or low blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, water retention, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, liver damage, increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Use of unprescribed hormones is common, but little is known about the associated risks. One potential hazard is HIV transmission from needle sharing. Cross-sex hormones may reduce fertility. =Injectable silicone= Some trans women use injectable silicone, sometimes administered by lay persons, to achieve their desired physique. This is most frequently injected into the hip and buttocks. It is associated with considerable medical complications, including morbidity. Such silicone may migrate, causing disfigurement years later. Non-medical grade silicone may contain contaminants, and may be injected using a shared needle. In New York City silicone injection occurs frequently enough to be called 'epidemic', with a NYC survey of trans women finding that 18% were receiving silicone injections from 'black market' providers. =Sexually transmitted infections= Trans people (especially trans women ‚Äì trans men have actually been found to have a lower rate of HIV than the general US population) are frequently forced into sex work to make a living, and are subsequently at increased risk for STIs including HIV. According to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 2.64% of American transgender people are HIV positive, and transgender sex workers are over 37 times more likely than members of the general American population to be HIV positive. HIV is also more common in trans people of color. For example, in a study by the National Institute of Health more than 56% of African-American trans women were HIV-positive compared to 27% of trans women in general. This has been connected to how trans people of color are more likely to be sex workers. A 2012 meta analysis of studies assessing rates of HIV infection among transgender women in 15 countries found that trans women are 49 times more likely to have HIV than the general population. HIV positive trans persons are likely to be unaware of their status. In one study, 73% of HIV-positive trans women were unaware of their status. Latin American trans women have a HIV prevalence of 35%,http://www.aidsalliance.org/publicationsdetails.aspx?id=90623&dm;_t=0,0,0,0,0 but most Latin American countries do not recognize transgender people as a population. Therefore, there are no laws catering to their health needs. Transgender people have higher levels of interaction with the police than the general population. 7% of transgender Americans have been held in prison cell simply due to their gender identity/expression. This rate is 41% for transgender African-Americans. 16% of respondents had been sexually assaulted in prison, a risk factor for HIV. 20% of trans women are sexually assaulted in prison, compared to 6% of trans men. Trans women of color are more likely to be assaulted whilst in prison. 38% of black trans women report having been sexually assaulted in prison compared to 12% of white trans women. In a San Francisco study, 68% of trans women and 55% of trans men reported having been raped, a risk factor for HIV. =Substance abuse= Trans people are more likely than the general population to use substances. For example, studies have shown that trans men are 50% more likely, and trans women 200% more likely to smoke cigarettes than other populations. It has been suggested that tobacco use is high among transgender people because many use it to maintain weight loss. In one study of transgender people, the majority had a history of non-injection drug use with the rates being 90% for marijuana, 66% for cocaine, 24% for heroin, and 48% for crack. It has been suggested that transgender people who are more accepted by their families are less likely to develop substance abuse issues. In the Trans Mental Health Study 2012, 24% of participants had used drugs within the past year. The most commonly used drug was cannabis. 19% currently smoked. A study published in 2013 found that among a sample of transgender adults, 26.5% had abused prescription drugs, most commonly analgesics. Health of LGBT people of color In a review of research, Balmsam, Molina, et al., found that \\"LGBT issues were addressed in 3,777 articles dedicated to public health; of these, 85% omitted information on race/ethnicity of participants\\".Balsam, Kimberly F. Molina, Yamile. Breadness, Blair. Simoni, Jane. Walters, Karina. (2011). Measuring multiple minority STress: The LGBT people of color microaggressions scale. Cultural and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 17(2), 163-174. However, studies that have noted race have found significant health disparities between white LGBT people and LGBT people of color. LGBT health research has also been criticized for lack of diversity in that, for example, a study may call for lesbians, but many black and minority ethnic groups do not use the term lesbian or gay to describe themselves. There have not been many studies dedicated to researching health issues in LGBT people of color until fairly recently. Studies have determined that LGBT individuals have an elevated risk of early mortality and more mental and physical health issues than heterosexual individuals. In particular, A study conducted by Kim, Jen, Fredriksen-Goldsen published in 2017 delved deeper into the health disparities found among LGBT older adults. It is well known in comparison with white LGBT older adults, black and latino LGBT older adults tend to have a lower quality of life in relation to their health.The study finds that this is due to a variety of factors, including discrimination, educational attainment, income levels, and social resources. Black LGBT adults experienced higher levels of LGBT discrimination than their white counterparts. However, the study found that black and latino LGBT adults had comparable mental health to white LGBT elders, presumed to be due to increased levels of spirituality characteristic of Latino and African American communities. The influences of racism, homophobia, and transphobia can have detrimental effects on mental health of LGBT people of color, especially in intersection with one another. Velez, Polihronakis et al. look at prior research that indicates that experiences of homophobia and internalized homophobia are associated with poor mental health. Similar research also indicates that racism and internalized racism are associated with poor mental health as well. When combined, discrimination and internalized oppression interact with one another and contribute to psychological distress. Both homophobia and racism contribute additively to distress, but it was noted that homophobic discrimination and internalized racism had the most significant and detrimental effects on well being. This study shows similar results to previous research in this aspect. This pattern was also seen in a sample of LGBT Latinx people. There are significant gaps in knowledge regarding health disparities among transgender individuals. In general, transgender individuals tends to be effected the most acutely by LGBT issues. This is even more prominent in transgender people of color. Transgender individuals are also more likely to experience greater socioeconomic disadvantages, greater stressors, and more exposure to traumatic events. Transgender individuals, particularly transgender individuals of color, struggle with access and discriminatory treatment when seeking medical and mental health care access. Transgender people and people of color both struggle with poor health care experiences, both medical and regarding mental health, in the United States. When looking at the experiences of transgender people of color, healthcare provider‚Äôs assumptions and biases about them negatively influence their healthcare experience. Even when seeking care from LGBT specific or LGBT friendly health care providers, people of color often worry about experiencing racism. Positive healthcare experiences for transgender people of color can most often be attributed to provider‚Äôs respect and knowledge around gender identity and sexuality, as well as cultural competency. LGBT people also routinely struggle with medical and mental health care access in relation to the general public. Transgender people as noted above, transgender and gender nonconforming people are significantly more likely to express concerns about how they will be treated in seeking healthcare. LGBT people of color and LGBT people with low incomes were found to be more likely to experience care that was discriminatory and substandard. In particular, transgender people of color and transgender people with low incomes were more likely to experience care that is discriminatory and substandard. These issues are highlighted in health care institutions serving populations with limited access, options, or significant health care disparities. This is particularly true of public hospitals, which have fewer resources than nonprofit hospitals and academic medical centers, and are under deeper financial pressures. Public hospitals have very little incentive to invest in care for marginalized populations, and as such there has been very little progress on LGBT inclusion in health care. The healthcare community itself has contributed to LGBT health disparities, through prejudice and inadequate knowledge. Correcting these disparities will require a significant investment by the healthcare system. In recent years, there has been research conducted into the needs of Mexican transgender asylum seekers. Transgender, specifically male to female, asylum seekers suffer a variety of health issues related to the stressors of being a transgender, ethnic minority in typically low socioeconomic status. Holding the status of being not only transgender, but also Mexican and seeking asylum likely compounds health issues. Asylum seekers often struggle with language barriers and a difference in cultures. A study conducted by Gowin, Taylor, Dunnington, Alshuwaiyer, and Cheney researches the needs of this demographic. All of the transgender asylum seekers studied had experienced some form of threat, physical assault, and/or sexual assault while living in Mexico. Stressors were reduced upon arrival in the United States, but not all and few were eliminated. Stressors included assaults (verbal, physical, and sexual), unstable environments, fear of safety, concealing undocumented status, and economic insecurity. These lead to multiple health consequences, including mental illness, sleep issues, isolation, substance abuse, and suicidal tendencies. Asylum seekers often had difficulties accessing health care services for hormones, and often withheld information during treatment for fear of being reported for holding undocumented status. Distrust of authority figures is not uncommon in minority groups. Methods of contact that allow trust should be built to encourage access to health services. Health promotion practices have found some success; including the use of lay health workers, which also has the benefit of employing community members. A focus on inclusive and non-judgmental communication methods in training and development can also help reduce distrust of health services by transgender and ethnic minority patients. Healthcare education Various bodies have called for dedicated teaching on LGBT issues for healthcare students and professionals, including the World Health OrganisationWorld Health Organization. \\"Improving the Health and Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Persons: Report by the Secretariat.\\" World Health Organization: Geneva, Switzerland, 2013. http://www.ghwatch.org/sites/www.ghwatch.org/files/B133-6_LGBT.pdf and the Association of American Medical Colleges.AAMC Advisory Committee on Sexual Orientation GI, and Sex Development. \\"Implementing Curricular and Institutional Climate Changes to Improve Health Care for Individuals Who are LGBT, Gender Nonconforming, or Born with DSD.\\" AAMC: Washington, DC, USA, 2014. A 2017 systematic review found that dedicated training improved knowledge, attitudes and practice, but noted that programmes often had minimal involvement by LGBT individuals themselves. Several government-funded organizations have launched other initiatives to involve LGBT individuals: \\"Healthy People 2020: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health\\" is a government-funded initiative sponsored by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, based on a 10-year agenda with the goal of improving the nation‚Äôs health in measurable ways. \\"The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People: Building a Foundation for Better Understanding\\" written by the Institute of Medicine and based on research funded by the National Institutes of Health emphasizes the importance of collecting data on the demographics of LGBT populations, improving methods for collecting this data, and increasing the participation of LGBT individuals in research. \\"LGBT Health and Well-being\\" published by the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), this 2012 report outlines the LGBT Issues Coordinating Committee‚Äôs objectives for 2011 and 2012. The HHS also hosts an online center for information on LGBT health, including HHS reports, information on access to health care, and resources organized for specific communities within the LGBT population (including LGBT youth, people living with HIV, refugees, women, and older adults). In addition, many nonprofit initiatives have worked to connect LGBT people to competent healthcare. OutCare Health and Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality (formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Medical Association) hosts an online directories of culturally-competent medical professionals. In 2019, WAXOH, in partnership with DatingPositives, The Phluid Project, Bi.org, Hairrari, the OUT Foundation, launched #WeNeedAButton, a campaign that calls for patient-matching sites like Yelp and ZocDoc to add a queer-friendly button or filter, so that consumers can easily see which doctors are LGBTQ-friendly. The campaign was launched during Pride 2019, on the 50th anniversary of Stonewall, and was supported by ambassador and journalist Zachary Zane and sexual health advocate Josh Robbins. Kaiser Permanente, the third-largest health care organization in the country and headquartered in Oakland, has been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for its commitment to LGBTQ in its 2018 Healthcare Equality Index, and has designated the organization a \\"healthcare equality leader\\"every year since 2010.

Both of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force reconnaissance assets, FMF Recon and MarDiv Recon, widely use combatant diving. During this eight-week course, trainees are introduced to open and closed-circuit diving (using the Dr√§ger LAR-V rebreather), diving physics and medical aid. Most of the training in combatant diving is done at night. The course provides underwater tactical training and the skills needed to successfully conduct underwater navigation for infiltration and exfiltration. The candidates negotiate long distances in open water, infiltrating by surface and sub-surface, learning to deal with the hazards of a surf zone tangle and simulated equipment malfunctions. The combatant divers course combines lecture, demonstration, and practical application in oxygen charging procedures using the USMC Oxygen Transfer Pump System, or USMC OTPS. Upon the completion of this course, the Marines (of any MOS that attends) are given the Special \\"B\\" MOS 0324 Reconnaissance Man, Combatant Diver Qualified (NMOS) [formerly 8653].

It was first formed during World War II to teach selected reconnaissance Marines and sailors the fundamentals of advanced swimming. They were located on both of United States's coasts, at the naval amphibious bases, NAB Little Creek and NAB Coronado.Bruce F. Meyers, Fortune Favors the Brave, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004). By the late 1980s, some combatant swimming courses were taught using the Marine Corps's own infrastructure, by experienced Marine combat divers. Because of the lack of facilities on Marine Corps bases, the Navy continued to provide the necessary training grounds for such training activities. The USMC Combatant Divers Course was established in 1993 at the Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center (NDSTC) in Panama City, FL.
