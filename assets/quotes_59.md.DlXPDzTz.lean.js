The nail creates a wound on the inside of the hoof wall. A close nail or a nail bind is the placement of a horseshoe nail so close to the sensitive structures inside the horse's hoof that it causes discomfort to the horse. The nail is not necessarily placed in the sensitive structures itself, but creates a pressure on the quick of the horses hoof. Nail prick is also simply called horse shoe nail misplacement. Horse shoe nail misplacement has several names and the terminology is not always used with exactly the same meaning. It is also called to puncture, to pinch, to prick, or to quick a horse. Quicking or nail- quicked is used both for the actual penetration (pricking) into the area with sensitive tissue of the horse's hoof and about a close nail that exerts pressure on the sensitive tissue. Colloquially it is also called hot nail. Cause If the nail takes the wrong direction and penetrates inside the hoofwall it leads to bleeding and pressure inside the sole. This area is rich in blood vessels and nerves and damage here is very painful to the horse. Nail prick can occur due to poorly made horseshoes, misdirected nails, too large nails, poorly placed nail holes, and faulty nails. Horses with poor hoof quality, thin hoof walls, or flaring hoof walls are difficult to nail and there is an increased risk of nail prick. Nail prick is due to a horseshoe nail penetrating the hoof wall and coming too close to or penetrating the sensitive structures inside the horse's hoof. Nail prick can happen to the best of farriers especially if the horse is fractious or young and has not been previously shod. Symptoms The symptoms of nail prick are varying degrees of lameness in the horse. Nail pricking leads to the horse going lame at once. A close nail leads to the horse going lame after some days. Placing the thongs on the head of the nail is a way to identify which nail is the cause. If the faulty nail are taken out at once the horse will have few symptoms of pain (whether or not there is blood from the hole). The hoof will turn warm and by feeling the arteries to the hoof an increased pulsation can be felt. When the hoof is inspected the horse can feel pain when pressure is applied to the damaged area.  Treatment  It is primarily the farrier who takes care of nail prick and close nails. If the nail prick is discovered at once further treatment is usually not necessary. Sometimes the whole shoe is taken off. If there is suspicion of dirt or bacteria having entered the wound together with the nail the nailhole should be enlarged to obtain drainage and the nail hole can be irrigated with dimethyl sulfoxide, povidone-iodine solution, or hydrogen peroxide. Veterinary treatment includes taking the shoe off, cutting the hoof clean and opening the nail hole to allow drainage. If the horse is in pain anesthesia of the nerve is given. The hole is irrigated and the hole can be packed with iodine-soaked cotton. Superficial infections may only need one treatment. The horse can be given an antiseptic foot bandage for 3‚Äì4 days and then be shod if the lameness is gone. The prognosis is usually good provided that minimal damage occurs to vatial structures of the foot. Tetanus prophylaxis is used for unvaccinated horses.

Cousins then set up his own Tamoki, Wambesi, and Uhuru labels, issuing \\"Down Comes The Rain\\". In 1971, The Royals re-recorded \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\", with Lloyd Forest temporarily replacing Wilson, its success prompting Dodd to issue the original version (still credited to The Tempests), which was also popular, its rhythm being used by several other artists since. More releases in a similar vein followed during the 1970s, these later collected on the album Pick Up the Pieces in 1978, released by Mo Claridge's newly formed Mojo distribution. The line-up changed again in 1975, with Cousins recruiting new members to replace his former colleagues who moved to Channel One Studios and recorded as The Jays. The success of Pick Up the Pieces led to a deal with United Artists, with two more studio albums (Ten Years After and Israel Be Wise) following, but Cousins then increasingly concentrated on producing other artists.

The Gompertzian model of tumor cell growth shows tumor cells growing fastest when the tumor is small. When a large (slow growing) tumor is surgically removed, microtumors or individual neoplastic cells that remain will be able to grow at their fastest rate. Standard treatment may include chemotherapy once every three weeks. This would allow bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract recovery before the next treatment and would inhibit the tumor for a short time, but allow rapid growth for a short time before the next treatment. By decreasing the dose and increasing the frequency, the fast growth can be prevented, allowing for faster and more effective cure rate. Although the dose is reduced in each treatment, the total quantity of chemotherapy may or may not be increased over the duration of the typical treatment time. For example, in standard treatment of ovarian cancer, paclitaxel is given at 175 mg/m2 body surface every three weeks. In dose dense therapy paclitaxel is given at 50‚Äì80 mg/m2 every week (150‚Äì240 mg/m2 in 3-weeks).

The name \\"Metgethen\\" was carried by the estate's owners until 1482, when the last of that name married his daughter to Christoph von R√∂der, a commander from the Thirteen Years' War and ancestor of Erhard Ernst von R√∂der. Its manor was constructed ca. 1760 by an Italian architect.B√∂tticher, p. 58 Metgethen developed into a villa suburb ca. 1900 and was popular for day trips, especially its Vierbr√ºderkrug inn and the Vierbr√ºders√§ule memorial honoring the legend of four half-brothers of the Teutonic Knights slain by Sudovians in the 13th century.Albinus, p. 326 The suburb contained the Landfrauenschule Metgethen, a school for East Prussian women, as well as the fire academyGause, p. 134 and a Volkssportschule to train physical education teachers.Gause, p. 90 A church for the village was sponsored by the merchant Gustav Bruhn and built by Edmund May in 1924-1925. Metgethen was incorporated into the city of K√∂nigsberg in 1939;Gause, p. 133 to the east of Metgethen was the quarter Moditten. During World War II, the architect Alfred Fiedler of Tilsit, an ally of Erich Koch, constructed a cement factory in Metgethen which used Ukrainian forced labor to make anti-air defense. In 1945, during the Battle of K√∂nigsberg, a German counter-attack recaptured Metgethen from the Red Army. German military personnel reported evidence of a massacre of civilians carried out by the Red Army during the three weeks the village was under Soviet occupation. In 1946, after northern East Prussia became part of the Soviet Union, all German place names were changed to Russian ones, and Metgethen was renamed Lesnoye. In 1956, it was given its current name in honor of Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky, a Soviet war hero who was killed in a battle northwest of K√∂nigsberg in 1945. In later years, it lost its status of a stand-alone inhabited locality and was incorporated into Kaliningrad as one of its residential areas.

A version where marbles compete in a race to win is a called a marble race. Characteristics Rolling ball sculpture art typically includes rails or tracks made of metal, wood, plastic, or other material, and one or more balls or marbles that travel down the tracks. Ball types include, but are not limited to, steel, acrylic, wood and glass. More modern versions may be digitally made in physics software. Rolling ball sculptures are often described as being both busy and soothing at the same time. They are an artistic form of mechanical motion. Rolling ball sculptures rarely use circular-cross-sectioned tubes for the runs; tubes can induce balls to oscillate in ways that can introduce unpredictable delays; because of this, most sculptures use parallel guide rails on either side of the ball. The tallest rolling ball sculpture in the world, at tall, named the Energy Machine, located in the Hong Kong Science Museum in Hong Kong.Knikkers, Jelle (October 28, 2015) \\"Marble Run Records\\" Jelle's Marble Runs Accessed:December 31, 2019 Toys and kits A simple marble run Rolling ball sculptures, typically marketed as \\"marble runs\\" are commonly sold as children's toys worldwide. Unlike professional kinetic sculptures, however, their commercial counterparts are typically made of wood or plastic and feature small, interlocking pieces that can generate a large number of track configurations. More complicated add-ons, such as jumps, loops, trampolines, xylophone ramps and electronic triggers are also typical with more complex sets. There are also programs that allow people to make marble runs for free. They can either be physics software, or dedicated marble race programs. Notable examples of software include: * Marble Run * Algodoo Examples of commercial rolling ball sculptures include Spacewarp from Bandai, Techno Ball, and Chaos Machine.

A calcite sea is one in which low-magnesium calcite is the primary inorganic marine calcium carbonate precipitate. An aragonite sea is the alternate seawater chemistry in which aragonite and high-magnesium calcite are the primary inorganic carbonate precipitates. The Early Paleozoic and the Middle to Late Mesozoic oceans were predominantly calcite seas, whereas the Middle Paleozoic through the Early Mesozoic and the Cenozoic (including today) are characterized by aragonite seas ). Jurassic hardground with encrusting oysters and borings. The most significant geological and biological effects of calcite sea conditions include rapid and widespread formation of carbonate hardgrounds, calcitic ooids, calcite cements, and the contemporaneous dissolution of aragonite shells in shallow warm seas. Hardgrounds were very common, for example, in the calcite seas of the Ordovician and Jurassic, but virtually absent from the aragonite seas of the Permian. Fossils of invertebrate organisms found in calcite sea deposits are usually dominated by either thick calcite shells and skeletons, were infaunal and/or had thick periostraca, or had an inner shell of aragonite and an outer shell of calcite. This was apparently because aragonite dissolved quickly on the seafloor and had to be either avoided or protected as a biomineral. Calcite seas were coincident with times of rapid seafloor spreading and global greenhouse climate conditions. Seafloor spreading centers cycle seawater through hydrothermal vents, reducing the ratio of magnesium to calcium in the seawater through metamorphism of calcium-rich minerals in basalt to magnesium-rich clays. This reduction in the Mg/Ca ratio favors the precipitation of calcite over aragonite. Increased seafloor spreading also means increased volcanism and elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans. This may also have an effect on which polymorph of calcium carbonate is precipitated. Further, high calcium concentrations of seawater favor the burial of CaCO3, thereby removing alkalinity from the ocean, lowering seawater pH and reducing its acid/base buffering.

Visions Today; pp. 17‚Äì19, 38 Lahusen's photographs of lesbians appeared on several of the covers of The Ladder from 1964 to 1966 while her partner, Barbara Gittings, was the editor. Lahusen helped with the founding of the original Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) in 1970, she contributed to a New York-based weekly newspaper named Gay Newsweekly, and co-authored The Gay Crusaders with Randy Wicker. She adopted the surname \\"Tobin\\" as a pseudonym for a period of time, but apparently never legally changed her name. Early life Katherine Lahusen was born to George H. and Katherine W. Lahusen in 1930, and brought up in Cincinnati, Ohio. She developed her interest in photography as a child. \\"Even as a kid I liked using a little box camera and pushing it and trying to get something artsy out of it\\", she recalled. She discovered while in college that she had romantic feelings for a woman and she had a relationship with her for six years, but after the woman left \\"in order to marry and have a normal life\\", Lahusen was devastated by the loss.Corrine, Tee (Winter 2005-2006). \\"Kay Tobin Lahusen: Photographer as Activist\\". Sinister Wisdom 66 pp. 64‚Äì68 The Ladder covers Lahusen spent the next six years in Boston working in the reference library of The Christian Science Monitor. She met Barbara Brooks Gittings in 1961 at a Daughters of Bilitis picnic in Rhode Island. They became a couple and Lahusen moved to Philadelphia to be with Gittings. When Gittings took over The Ladder in 1963, Lahusen made it a priority to improve the quality of art on the covers. Where previously there were simple line drawings, characterized by Lahusen as \\"pretty bland, little cats, insipid human figures,\\" Lahusen began to add photographs of real lesbians on the cover beginning in September 1964. The first showed two women from the back, on a beach looking out to sea. But Lahusen really wanted to add full-face portraits of lesbians. \\"If you go around as if you don't dare show your face, it sends forth a terrible message\\", Lahusen remembered. Several covers showed various women willing to pose in profile, or in sunglasses, but in January 1966 she was finally able to get a full-face portrait. Lilli Vincenz, open and smiling, adorned the cover of The Ladder. By the end of Gittings' period as editor, Lahusen remembered there was a waiting list of women who wanted to be full-face on the cover of the magazine. She wrote articles in The Ladder under the name Kay Tobin, a name she picked out of the phone book, and which she found was easier for people to pronounce and remember. Photojournalism Lahusen photographed Gittings and other people who picketed federal buildings and Independence Hall in the mid to late 1960s. She contributed photographs and articles to a Manhattan newspaper called Gay Newsweekly, and worked in New York City's Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore, the first bookstore devoted to better literature on gay themes, and to disseminating materials that promoted a gay political agenda. She worked with Gittings in the gay caucus of the American Library Association, and photographed thousands of activists, marches, and events in the 1960s and 1970s. Frank Kameny and Jack Nichols and many other gay activists became her subjects. Later life In the 1980s Lahusen became involved in real estate, and placed ads in gay papers. She also organized agents to get them to march in New York City's Gay Pride Parade. More recently, her photographs have been featured in exhibits at The William Way Community Center in Philadelphia and the Wilmington Institute Library in Delaware. In 2007, all of Lahusen's photos and writings and Gittings' papers and writings were donated to the New York Public Library. press release, April 25, 2007; retrieved December 26, 2007. Lahusen and Gittings were together for 46 years when Gittings died of breast cancer on February 18, 2007, aged 74. Lahusen was working on collecting her photographs for a photography scrapbook on the history of the gay rights movement when Gittings' illness put the plans on hold. Lahusen currently resides in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania in an assisted living facility. A plot of land at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. has been allotted to Lahusen next to the burial place of Gittings.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. There were 1,692 tornadoes confirmed in the United States in 2008, with 126 confirmed fatalities. This made 2008 the deadliest year in that country since 1998. Fatalities were also reported elsewhere in the world: three in France, two each in Bangladesh and Poland and one in Russia, and 18 in China. With 1,692 confirmed tornadoes, 2008 ranked as the third most active US tornado season on record, only 2011 and 2004 have had more tornadoes confirmed with 1,703 and 1,817, respectively. The US state of Kansas received the most tornadoes in the United States in 2008 with 187.Kansas again is tops in the U.S. for tornadoes. Retrieved on February 9, 2009. Synopsis Daily tornado count and some major outbreaks during 2008 The winter months of January and February (usually a fairly quiet time of year for severe weather) were unusually active in 2008 in the US, with several major outbreaks taking place. The first major outbreak took place on the week of January 7, which was unusually far north for January. February saw a new record for tornadoes in that month, with one of the most prolific outbreaks in recent years (and the deadliest since 1985) taking place on February 5, and three smaller outbreaks also taking place later in the month. March was also fairly active, but not at record levels. Steady activity in the first week of the month, an outbreak on March 15 and additional activity at month's end were mostly responsible. April was also active, which was due to steady tornado activity throughout the month despite the fact there were no prolific outbreaks. From the beginning of May until mid-June, severe weather was frequent and widespread across the US. Beginning with a significant outbreak on May 2, there were many major outbreaks over that period with smaller outbreaks occurring almost daily. Over that six-week period, well over 600 tornadoes were reported in the US, with many destructive tornadoes over that time frame. The worst tornado events were on May 10, May 22‚Äì23, May 25 and June 11. After that, activity calmed down somewhat to a more normal pace in the second half of June and into July with several smaller severe weather events. The summer and early fall months from July to September ran somewhat above average in the US; tropical cyclones and their remnants were mostly responsible for the tornado activity from mid-August through mid-September. This was seen particularly from Tropical Storm Fay, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike, each of which resulted in large numbers of mostly weak tornadoes. Activity dropped significantly in October, with below normal activity and no major outbreaks. The relative inactivity continued into November before returning to a slightly above normal rate in December, with most of the activity taking place in the middle of the month. Overseas, the months of July and August were quite active in Europe with several significant tornado events, including at least one major outbreak. NOAA also concluded there \\"is no evidence for a detected change in tornado activity to date due to greenhouse gas emission increases.\\" Events =United States yearly total= January There were 136 tornadoes reported in the United States in January, of which 84 were confirmed. =January 7‚Äì10= EF3 damage in Wheatland, Wisconsin A rarity for January in the Midwest, the first significant severe weather event of the year developed in the Central U.S on January 7. Over 70 tornadoes were reported that day, including major tornadoes dominated by two supercell areas. In the late afternoon, a rare series of tornadoes took place in northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin. EF3 tornadoes caused major damage in and around Wheatland, Wisconsin and Lawrence, Illinois. A train carrying hazardous materials was derailed in Lawrence, prompting an evacuation of the town. The Wheatland tornado was only the second January tornado on record in Wisconsin, with the other being on January 24, 1967. Another round of tornadoes took place in the Springfield, Missouri area. An EF1 impacted part of downtown Springfield itself. Major damage to numerous farms, mobile homes, and frame homes Marshfield and Strafford due to a long- tracked EF3 that killed three people. On January 8, more severe weather took place, including an EF2 tornado near Appleton, Arkansas that killed one person in a mobile home. School bus that was lifted and dropped onto the roof of a damaged school in Caledonia, Mississippi on January 10, 2008 Hot on the heels of the previous outbreak, another severe weather event occurred across the Southern United States on January 10 as a new system moved across the region. The Storm Prediction Center upgraded the threat to a moderate risk late that morning as tornadoes were expected, particularly in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. 20 tornadoes were reported, and four EF3 tornadoes were confirmed, including in Attala, Lowndes, and Choctaw Counties in Mississippi, and Tuscaloosa County, Alabama.

It was later found that two people were killed in a mobile home in Posey County, Indiana by an isolated EF2 tornado embedded in the squall line. A third fatality took place in Clark County due to an EF1 tornado. Other tornadoes hit Speedway, Indiana and a suburban area in Louisville, both of which were EF1.

Her husband was acclaimed emperor in October 306 against the wishes of Valeria Maximilla's father, who tried to overthrow the usurper in 307 but without success. Maxentius remained the ruler of Rome, Italy and Africa until 312, when Constantine I invaded Italy. Valeria and her husband were together before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, when she disappears from the historical record. Her fate is unknown. Their son, Romulus, died in 309. Valeria Maximilla's portrait does not appear on any of the coinage issued under Maxentius, but she may have been depicted on a defaced sculpture now housed in the Capitoline Museums. If it is of Maximilla, it was likely defaced after her husband's overthrow, when his own images were also defaced. St. Catherine  In St. Catherine's hagiography  Maximilla may be the nameless queen who appears in the hagiography of St. Catherine of Alexandria by Jacobus de Voragine (one of the fantastic stories in the \\"Golden Legend\\"). In this story, the queen converted to Christianity after meeting with Catherine, and the both of them were then tortured and executed by Maxentius, depicted here as a persecutor of Christians. In another similar version by 15th-century Italian hagiographer Petrus de Natalibus, the queen was named \\"Faustina\\". She was accompanied to Catherine's jail by Porphyrius, an army captain. Along with Faustina, the captain and 200 of his soldiers also converted, and they were all supposedly martyred by Maxentius. In Eastern Orthodox churches, Faustina, Porphyrius (called a stratelates) and the soldiers share a feast day with Catherine: November 24 for Russian Orthodoxes, and Nov. 25 for Greek Orthodoxes.

He has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church.Homily of John Paul II Life He was born Luca Antonio Pirozzo in 1582 in the city of Bisignano in the region of Calabria, the son of Giovanni Pirozzo and Ginevra Giardino. He grew up a very religious child and was known to be often at prayer, attending Mass daily and receiving Holy Communion as often as was permitted, a rare practice during that era. He was noted during his youth as an exemplar of humility, in keeping with the religious name he later adopted, as a result of his literally turning his cheek after being brutally slapped in the face in the city square. About the age of 18, Pirozzo felt called to enter a religious order, but, for various reasons, did not do so until 1609. In that year, aged 27, he felt called to enter the Reformed Friars Minor, a branch of the Order following a more severe way of life, who had a community at the medieval Convento di Riforma (Friary of the Reform) in his city. He was admitted that same year as a lay brother into the novitiate of those friars which was located at Mesoraca in the Province of Crotone, at which time he received the religious habit and was given the name by which he is known. After overcoming various difficulties arising during that year of probation, he was allowed to profess religious vows as a full member of the Order on 4 September 1610. Humilis had been known to experience religious ecstasy since his childhood. After his admission to the Friars Minor, he was assigned to the various domestic tasks entrusted to the lay brothers among the friars. His superiors in the Order was also repeatedly subjected him to many tasks and challenges to determine his character and the validity of these supernatural experiences. Although illiterate, he was found able to explain clearly some of the deepest doctrines of the Catholic faith to officials of the Church, even the Inquisitor of the kingdom. Known for his gentleness and innocence of mind, Humilis came to earn the great respect of his fellow friars. He was chosen by Benigno de Genova, the Minister General of the Friars Minor (1618-1625), to be his companion for his canonical visitation to the friars of southern Italy and Sicily. After this, Humilis was summoned to Rome, where he served as a respected adviser to Pope Gregory XV as well as Pope Urban VIII. During this period, he lived primarily at the Friary of San Francesco a Ripa. Humilis returned to his native city many years later, where he died in 1637. He was interred in the cemetery of the friars at the friary in his native city. Veneration The cause for Humilis' canonization was begun in mid-17th century. He was declared venerable by Pope Pius VI in 1780 and beatified in 1882 by Pope Leo XIII. He was declared a saint by Pope John Paul II in 2002.Saint Humilis of Bisignano at Patron Saints Index References External links * Site sur San Umile Category:1582 births Category:1637 deaths Category:People from the Province of Cosenza Category:Italian Friars Minor Category:Franciscan mystics Category:Wonderworkers Category:16th-century Italian people Category:17th-century Italian people Category:Canonizations by Pope John Paul II Category:16th-century Christian saints Category:17th-century Christian saints Category:16th-century Christian mystics Category:17th-century Christian mystics Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:Franciscan saints Category:Canonized Roman Catholic religious brothers ","title":"Humilis of Bisignano"},{"id":"14896787","text":"NGC 189 is an open cluster in the Cassiopeia constellation.

Railways have been employed for military purposes in wartime since the Revolutions of 1848. Improvements in other forms of transport have rendered railways less important to the military since the end of World War II and the Cold War, although they are still employed for the transport of armoured vehicles to and from exercises or the mass transport of vehicles to a theatre of operations. The US Air Force developed the Peacekeeper Rail Garrison mobile ICBM in the 1980s, but it never reached operational status. Due to the expense and time required to build specifically military railway networks, military use of railways is usually based on a pre-existing civilian railway network rather than a military-owned one. However, specialized military types of rolling stock have frequently been used. Military railway is usually built and operated by railway troops.

The Prussian Army used railways to move its forces during the First Schleswig War in 1849‚Äì1851. Three Prussian battalions were deployed by rail to crush the 1849 May Uprising in Dresden. The first Prussian regulations for transport of troops on state railways were issued in 1856. =Hungarian Revolution of 1848= In 1849, an Imperial Russian corps with all of its equipment, was moved by rail from Poland to G√∂ding in Moravia to link up with the Austrian army during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. =Crimean War= Military railways were used to establish a reliable supply to British Army troops besieging the city of Sevastopol from Balaklava during the severe winter of 1855 in the Crimean War. The Grand Crimean Central Railway was just long, and was purpose built. =Second Italian War of Independence= During the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, the French Army moved 130,000 soldiers to northern Italy by rail. The Imperial Guard Corps from Paris and two corps from Lyon were sent to Toulon via rail, from where a total of 70,000 men were shipped to Genoa. The French I Corps was then ferried from Genoa to Novi by rail. Another two French corps were transported by rail to Savoy, where they crossed the Alps and boarded trains to Turin. To improve Piedmont's railway system, the French Navy shipped locomotives to Genoa. A French siege train was shipped from Marseille and Toulon to Genoa, from where it was moved by rail to Lombardy for use against Mantua in late June. =American Civil War= The American Civil War in 1861‚Äì1865 was the first large war in which railroads were both a major tool and a major target of military action. A few railroads were custom built: * United States Military Railroad rebuilt the City Point Railroad, extending to Petersburg during the Siege of Petersburg * Confederate railroads in the American Civil War * Centreville Military Railroad =Paraguayan War= In 1867 during the Paraguayan War some ironclad vessels of the Brazilian navy became trapped on the River Paraguay between the enemy Paraguayan forts of Curupaty and Humait√°. To keep them supplied with fuel, ammunition and provisions the Brazilian ministry of marine ordered an emergency military railway to be built through the almost impenetrable coastal region of the Chaco. The sleepers of this line almost floated over the boggy ground. This supply line was known as the Affonso Celso, and sustained the ironclads in their precarious position for six months, until they were able to dash past the Fortress of Humait√° in an incident known as the Passage of Humait√°. = Russian use in Asia = The Trans-Siberian Railway (–¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω–∞—è –º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å - –¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Å–∏–±), before 1917 was called the Great Siberian Route (–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–π –°–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –ü—É—Ç—å).

German bombing of Polish railways contributed greatly to the swift success of the 1939 invasion of Poland. Japan built several railways for military purposes, notably the Burma-Siam Railway, known as the Death Railway because of the number of Allied prisoners-of-war and Asian labourers who died to construct it. The existing Northeast Indian Railways were expanded by the Americans to supply China via the Ledo Road. Railway lines were also constructed by the Allies in the Suez Canal area.

Located at 935 E. Colfax Avenue in the neighborhood of Capitol Hill, it was built in 1917 and has a maximum capacity of 1,600 for concerts. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  The Ogden Theatre was opened in 1919 by John Thompson, who also ran the Thompson (later Bluebird) Theater. The Ogden Theatre originally hosted live performances such as weekly organ recitals, dances, lectures and vaudeville acts - most notably, the legendary Harry Houdini. By 1937 it had been converted to a movie theater that featured everything from the classics to the avant garde. In the '80's it was a revival house that featured the cult movie classic, The Rocky Horror Picture Show every Saturday night. The inside and outside of the Ogden Theatre have been renovated many times throughout the years, as well as a host of different marquee signs have been used. The flat marquee on the theater was added during a major remodel in the 1970s and was upgraded in 1993. In the late 1980s, ownership of the theater changed hands numerous times until the theater was closed in 1990. The theatre was marked for demolition until Doug Kauffman of the independent live music promoter Nobody In Particular Presents purchased the building in 1992. Kauffman's vision was to turn the Ogden Theater into a premier music venue. The Ogden Theatre was re-opened in 1993 featuring a wide variety of live performances. The theatre found its niche and has become a premier concert venue in Denver featuring approximately 150 concerts per year. In 2006, NIPP leased the venue to AEG Live.

Purpose  According to Sacks, Musicophilia was written in an attempt to widen the general populace's understanding of music and its effects on the brain. As Sacks states at the outset of the book's preface, music is omnipresent, influencing human's everyday lives in how we think and act. However, unlike other animal species (such as birds) whose musical prowess is easier to understand in relation on a biological/evolutionary level, humanity's draw towards music and song is less clear-cut. There is no \\"music center\\" of the brain, yet the vast majority of humans have an innate ability to distinguish, \\"music, perceive tones, timbre, pitch intervals, melodic contours, harmony, and (perhaps most elementally) rhythm.\\" With that in mind, Sacks examines human's musical inclination through the lens of musical therapy and treatment, as a fair number of neurological injuries and diseases have been documented to be successfully treated with music. This understanding (along with a medical case Sacks witnessed in 1966 wherein a Parkinson's patient was able to be successfully treated via music therapy) is what galvanized Sacks to create an episodic compilation of patient cases that all experienced and were treated by music to some capacity. In doing so, Sacks concertizes each example by explaining the neurological factors that play into each patient's healing and treatment in ways that relate to a lay yet curious audience. Reviews In a review for The Washington Post, Peter D. Kramer wrote, \\"In Musicophilia, Sacks turns to the intersection of music and neurology -- music as affliction and music as treatment.\\" Kramer wrote, \\"Lacking the dynamic that propels Sacks's other work, Musicophilia threatens to disintegrate into a catalogue of disparate phenomena.\\" Kramer went on to say, \\"What makes Musicophilia cohere is Sacks himself. He is the book's moral argument. Curious, cultured, caring, in his person Sacks justifies the medical profession and, one is tempted to say, the human race.\\" Kramer concluded his review by writing, \\"Sacks is, in short, the ideal exponent of the view that responsiveness to music is intrinsic to our makeup. He is also the ideal guide to the territory he covers. Musicophilia allows readers to join Sacks where he is most alive, amid melodies and with his patients.\\" Musicophilia was listed as one of the best books of 2007 by The Washington Post.  Music and the brain  Sacks includes discussions of several different conditions associated with music as well as conditions that are helped by music. These include musical conditions such as musical hallucinations, absolute pitch, and synesthesia, and non-musical conditions such as blindness, amnesia, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. = Musical conditions = Sacks first discusses musical seizures, and he mainly writes about someone who had a tumor in his left temporal lobe which caused him to have seizures, during which he heard music. Sacks then writes about musical hallucinations that often accompany deafness, partial hearing loss, or conditions like tinnitus. Sacks also focuses a lot on absolute pitch, where a person is able to immediately identify the pitch of a musical note. Another condition Sacks spends a lot of time on is synesthesia. Sacks discusses several different types of synesthesia: key synesthesia, non-musical synesthesia centered on numbers, letters, and days, synesthesia centered on sounds in general, synesthesia centered on rhythm and tempo, and synesthesia in which the person sees lights and shapes instead of colors. Sacks also describes cases where synesthesia has accompanied blindness. = Conditions affected = Sacks discusses how blindness can affect the perception of music and musical notes, and he also writes that absolute pitch is much more common in blind musicians than it is in sighted musicians. Sacks writes about Clive Wearing, who suffers from severe amnesia. Sacks writes about how, even though Clive suffers from such severe amnesia, he still remembers how to read piano music and play the piano. However, Clive can only remember how to do so in the moment. Sacks also writes about Tourette syndrome and the effects that music can have on tics, for example, slowing tics down to match the tempo of a song. Sacks writes about Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and how, similar to with people who suffer from Tourette‚Äôs, music with a strong rhythmic beat can help with movement and coordination. Sacks briefly discusses Williams syndrome and how children with Williams syndrome were found to be very responsive to music. Sacks finishes his book with a discussion of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and dementia. He discusses how music therapy can help people with these conditions regain memory. = Behavioral effects = Certain portions of the brain are associated with how we use the brain to interact with music. For example, the cerebellum, a portion that coordinates movement and stores muscle memory, responds well to the introduction of music. For example, an Alzheimer's patient would not be able to recognise his wife, but would still remember how to play the piano because he dedicated this knowledge to muscle memory when he was young. Those memories never fade. Another example is the Putamen. This portion of the brain processes rhythm and regulates body movement and coordination. When introduced to music, if the amount of dopamine in the area is increased, it increases our response to rhythm. By doing this, music has the ability to temporarily stop the symptoms of such diseases as Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. The music serves as a cane to these patients, and when the music is taken away, the symptoms return. When it comes to which music people respond best to, it is a matter of individual background. In patients with dementia, it is found that most patients respond to music from their youth, rather than relying on a certain rhythm or element. Neuroscientist Kiminobu Sugaya explains ‚ÄúThat means memories associated with music are emotional memories, which never fade out- even in Alzheimer‚Äôs patients‚Äù. ‚ÄúMusic and the Brain: What Happens When You're Listening to Music.‚Äù Pegasus Magazine, University of Central Florida, www.ucf.edu/pegasus/your-brain-on-music/.  Studies on the effects of music therapy  Since the 1970s, there have been multiple studies on the benefits of music therapy for clients with medical conditions, trauma, learning disabilities, and handicaps. Most of the documented studies for children have shown a positive effect in promoting self-actualization and developing receptive, cognitive, and expressive capabilities. While the studies conducted with adults 18+ had overall positive effects, the conclusions were limited because of overt bias and small sample sizes. Since music is a fundamental aspect of every culture, it embodies every human emotion and even can transport us to an earlier time, an earlier memory. Oliver Sacks, author of Musicophilia, acknowledges the unconscious effects of music as our body tends to join in the rhythmic motions involuntarily. Working with clients with a variety of neurological conditions, Sacks observed the therapeutic potential and susceptibility to music. Even with the loss of language, music becomes the vehicle for expression, feeling, and interaction. Well-known music therapists Paul Nordoff and Clive Robbins documented their work with audio recordings and videos of the transformative results of music with children who had emotional or behavioral problems, traumatic experiences, or handicaps. Robbins classifies the ‚ÄúMusic Child‚Äù as the inner self in every child that evokes a healthy musical response. It is music that becomes the catalyst for discovering the child‚Äôs potential. In essence, musical play creates an atmosphere that emboldens a child to free expression and reproductive skills. Sometimes family members observe immediate effects because selfhood is encouraged and nurtured and thus a child‚Äôs personality develops in response to music. First, the music therapist assesses each client to determine impairments, preferences, and skill level. Notably, every person appreciates different musical genres. Next, treatment is determined based on individualized goals and selection as well as frequency and length of sessions. Finally, the progress of the client is evaluated and updated based on effectiveness. Although sessions are typically structured, therapist also remain flexible and try to meet clients where they are at emotionally and physically. When music therapy was first introduced in tandem with other medical fields, it was mostly receptive and patients listened to live solo performances or pre-recorded songs. Today, music therapist allow for more creative interactions by having clients improvise, reproduce music or imitate melodies vocally or with an instrument, compose their own songs, and/or listen during artistic expression or with movement. Recently, studies have been conducted on the effects of music with chemo patients, stroke patients, patients with Alzheimer, spinal or brain injury, and hospice patients. According to a 2017 report from Magee, Clark, Tamplin, and Bradt, a common theme of all their studies was the positive effect music had on mood, mental and physical state, increase in motivation and social engagement, and a connection with the client‚Äôs musical identity. From 2008-2012, the Department of Oncology/ Hematology of the University Medical Center in Hamburg-Eppendorf orchestrated a randomized pilot study to determine if music therapy helped patients cope with pain and reduce chemotherapy side effects. The sessions were given twice a week for twenty minutes and patients could choose either receptive or active methods. Each week, the quality of life, functioning ability and level of depression/anxiety were assessed. Although emotional functioning scores increased and perception of pain improved significantly, they determined the outcome was inconclusive because patients have differing levels of manageable side effects and a hope to survive may influence expectations of treatment. However, patients rated the program helpful and potentially beneficial. Moreover, the feasibility of these studies allows for music therapists to practice in educational, psychiatric, medical, and private settings. Although there haven‚Äôt been any statistical significance based on few empirical adult studies, the trend shows improvements on most measures.

Its congregation was formed in 1821 as Union Episcopal Church. Church construction began in 1833 and was completed in 1835, when it was consecrated by the Rt. Rev. John Henry Hopkins, first bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Vermont. In 1897 its name was changed to St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church. The congregation disbanded and the church was deconsecrated in 1974. It is owned by the Montgomery Historical Society and is now known as Pratt Hall.http://www.montgomeryhistoricalsociety.org/mhspratt.htm On October 1, 1988, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The building is a prominent early example of Gothic Revival architecture in the state. Description and history Pratt Hall stands in the village of Montgomery, just southwest of its triangular common on the northwest side of Vermont 118. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and square tower. The tower projects from the otherwise unadorned front facade, with a Gothic-arched entrance at the base, with narrow lancet- arch windows on the sides, and an oculus window above the entrance. The second stage houses the belfry, and is separated from the clock stage by a cornice. The tower is topped by a crenelated parapet. The interior contains elaborate woodwork in the Gothic style. with Montgomery's Episcopal congregation was one of the first in the town. This was its first church building, erected 1832-35 on land purchased in 1829. The church is one of Vermont's oldest examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Its construction began not long after completion of the first documented example of this style in Arlington. Originally a union church (shared by multiple congregations), this was soon used exclusively by the Episcopalians, as other denominations built their own churches. With its congregation in decline, in 1927 the church reduced its services to summer only, when more visitors came to town. In 1972 the diocese decided that the building was no longer safe for use and was going to demolish it. The Montgomery Historical Society bought the building in 1974, and has restored and maintained it since then. In addition to using Pratt Hall for its own meetings, the society makes it available for others to use as a venue for weddings, small concerts, talks, or other community gatherings.http://www.montgomeryhistoricalsociety.org/pratthall.htm The society named the building in honor of its founder, Lawrence Pratt, who was the driving force in rescuing the building from destruction.

In March 1924 he was knighted.  Parliamentary career  He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Belfast Woodvale from 1918 general election to 1922, and when that constituency was abolished for the 1922 general election he was returned for Belfast West, holding the seat until he stood down at the 1929 general election. At the 1921 Northern Irish general election Lynn was elected as a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for Belfast West, holding that seat until it was abolished for the 1929 Northern Irish general election. He was elected for the new North Antrim constituency, and held that seat until 1945. From 1937 to 1944 he was Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons.  Journalistic career  Lynn was the editor of the Northern Whig newspaper. He was a leading contributor to educational debates in Northern Ireland though his impartiality is in question, especially following a comment in the Northern Irish House of Commons that Irish language instruction was not worth spending money on. Lynn at first attacked the 1923 education bill for stripping Protestant schools of their denominational character. However, Lord Londonderry‚Äîthe Education Minister at the time‚Äîpersuaded him to support the measure making the latter one of the few public proponents of what amounted to nondenominational schooling. In 1902, the Education Act had been withheld from Ireland at the insistence of Roman Catholic bishops, the result of which was that education reform in Northern Ireland lagged behind that of the rest of the country by 1920. Lynn was asked by the Northern Irish government to look into reforms in education in 1921 and he set up what became known as the Lynn Committee. However, Roman Catholics refused to serve on or cooperate with the committee. Much guidance was therefore required of Roman Catholic Unionist, A. N. Bonaparte Wyse (who later became Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Education in Northern Ireland). While Roman Catholic representatives boycotted the committee, Lynn recommended government funding for a separate Roman Catholic education system in Northern Ireland. When the Lynn Committee published its report in 1923, its recommendations were adopted and made law by the Education Bill (NI) of 1923. On the difficulties of their dealings with the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Lynn Committee said this in their report: The Bill was bitterly assailed by both Catholic and Protestant clerics and was subsequently amended so that its original intent disappeared.N.C.

It is found in the Indo- Pacific region from Indonesia to Japan and south to the Great Barrier Reef and Papua New Guinea. The species has also been reported from Madagascar, Mauritius and R√©union. It grows to a maximum of 18 cm (7 in) in length. The body color is a bright to orange-yellow with a big black blotch below the dorsal fin and a vertical black bar running through the eye. Like the other butterflyfishes with angular yellow bodies with black eyestripes and a single differently-colored patch (except in the quite basal Blue-lashed Butterflyfish, C. bennetti), it belongs in the subgenus Tetrachaetodon. Among this group it seems to be particularly close to the Zanzibar butterflyfish (Chaetodon zanzibarensis) which has a smaller black blotch and traces of horizontal stripes on the flanks. If Chaetodon is split up, the subgenus Tetrachaetodon would be placed in Megaprotodon. The Mirror Butterflyfish is found in coral reefs at depths between 3 and 30 m. It favors coastal reef slopes rich in hydroids and sea anemones. Small juveniles hide in coral thickets. Usually, this species is solitary and relatively uncommon. They feed on coral polyps and invertebrates.

KTYK serves the Tyler-Longview, Henderson-Rusk County area. History KTYK signed on November 6, 1961 as KIMP-FM in Mount Pleasant at 96.1 MHz. KIMP-FM was the original FM sister to 960 KIMP. It moved to 100.7 MHz in the mid-1960s and changed call letters to KPXI in 1974. It carried a beautiful music/easy listening format until the mid-1980s, when it shifted to a gold-based AC format that began phasing out the older music and playing more uptempo songs. By 1988, it went straight ahead CHR as \\"X-100\\". X-100 attempted to compete in the Tyler market with a signal that covered a large area of northeast Texas, but rarely showed significant numbers in Tyler due to its limited signal strength within the city. In 1991, KPXI shifted back to an Adult Contemporary format, but flipped to country music by the end of the year. It ran various derivatives of country under the branding of \\"K-101\\" until it was moved to Overton and downgraded to a C3 signal in June 1999, so that co-channel KRJT 100.7 could relocate from Bowie to Highland Village as KLTY, which later changed calls to KWRD-FM, in order to rimshot the Dallas- Fort Worth Metroplex. After briefly running a stand-alone oldies format, KPXI was then simulcasted on the co-channel Highland Village licensed 100.7 MHz. KPXI was owned by various members of the Ward family from its sign on in the early 1960s until it went into receivership in the 1990-91 timeframe. East Texas Broadcasting purchased it from the receiver and sold it to Sunburst, which owned other Tyler/Longview market stations at the time, when it began the process of moving KRJT into Dallas/Ft. Worth. Sunburst exited the radio business in 2000 and sold KPXI to Salem along with KLTY. Sunburst's other Tyler/Longview area stations were sold to Waller Broadcasting. Jerry Hanszen purchased KPXI from Salem Media subsidiary Inspiration Media of Texas, LLC on June 3, 2009. In doing so, KPXI became the sister station to co-owned KWRD in Henderson, which Hanszen has purchased from former Tyler City Councilman Jerry Russell. KPXI would cease simulcasting co-channel KWRD-FM once the sale was consummated between the two parties, and launched a Classic Country format as \\"The Heartbeat of East Texas, KPXI 100.7 FM\\". On September 12, 2018, a license transfer of the KPXI facility was granted by the Federal Communications Commission, from Hanszen Broadcasting to the Board of Supervisors at Louisiana State University and A&M; College, after the two parties had reached a deal for L.S.U. to acquire the station. Neither sister station KWRD, nor its FM relay translator, was included in the sale. On October 11, 2018, KPXI was taken silent, in preparation of the facility's acquisition by Louisiana State University. As a result of the sale of KPXI, now former sister station KWRD has returned to its heritage country format, along with its FM relay translator at 98.5 MHz, dropping NBC Sports Radio in the process. Consummation of the license transfer also occurred on October 11, 2018, with KPXI dropping the longtime call letters associated with the facility that it had retained in the move from Mount Pleasant to Overton, changing to the current KTYK, which is representative of the programming focused target cities of Tyler and Kilgore, on October 12, 2018, one day after temporarily going silent in preparation of the transfer to Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

Such dishes are often dubbed with the \\"-kroeung\\" suffix. Kroeung is traditionally made by finely chopping the ingredients and grinding them together using a heavy mortar and pestle although mechanical food processors can be used in modern kitchens. The resulting paste is similar in form and function to Thai curry pastes. Various ingredients, depending on the dish and the taste of the cook, can be pounded into kroeung. The eight most commonly used are lemongrass, magrut lime zest and leaves, galangal, turmeric, garlic, shallots, dried red chillies and various rhizomes (lesser galangal, Boesenbergia rotunda (), Kaempferia galanga, etc.). This herbal paste is essential for preparing Khmer dishes in order to create the authentic flavour. Kroeung has two main categories: \\"Individual Kroeung\\" and \\"Royal Kroeung\\". Individual Kroeung are dishes which may call for extra ingredients specific to the dish, resulting in a unique-use kroeung. Royal Kroeung on the other hand is fairly standardized. The various types of kroeung can be further distinguished by their colors, specifically, yellow, green and red. The Color Kroeung are commonly used to make stuffings, soup, and stir-fry. Individual Kroueng Somlar kako () Kroeung that are pounded for specific single dishes or have only one unique use falls into this category. Individual Kroeung also consists of extra ingredients not found in its base recipe. Somlar Kako(·ûü·ûò·üí·ûõ·ûÄ·ûÄ·ûº·ûö), for example, requires roasted ground rice for the smoky flavor of the soup. The Kroeung in Amok(·û¢·û∂·ûò·üâ·ûª·ûÄ·ûè·üí·ûö·û∏) is considered an Individual Kroeung since it uses the red kroeung base but omits Turmeric in favor of Kaffir lime leaves. Traditionally, kroeung recipes, specifically for curries, requires whole spices to be ground with the herb paste. However, curry powder can also be used in place of the whole spices, in which case the kroeung would also be considered Individual Kroeung. Royal Kroeung Royal Kroeung is based on the kroeung used for royal dishes. The difference between Royal and Individual Kroeung is the extra ingredients sometimes used to make the paste, coriander and Kaffir Lime leaves (instead of zest). Not every Royal Kroeung makes use of the two extra ingredients, but they are the only additions or substitutions in the original recipe. Cambodians living abroad use Kaffir lime leaves instead of Kaffir lime zest, which is actually the whole lime rind that has been sun-dried, as Kaffir limes are not widely available outside of Cambodia, and by extension the South East Asian region. Color Kroeung There are three distinct color groups into which all kroeung can be categorized: red, green, and yellow. The dominant herb or spice present in the spice-blend paste tints the three different color kroeung. Uncooked kroeung will often change color as it cooks. The list of ingredients in these Color Kroeung will vary by recipe, and there are some ingredients included purely for their coloring ability. = Red Kroeung = The selected herbs and spices that goes into making Red Kroeung. Kroeung Kraharm (), Red Kroeung, receives its deep color from a type of dehydrated chili pod which contributes very little flavor to the kroeung and is added solely for the natural red color, although as the dish is meant to be spicy, hotter chilli peppers may also be used in the spice paste. Lemongrass stalks are used in this paste, rather than lemongrass leaves which would impart a green to the dish when cooked. The lemongrass stalk is a pale beige color, so it easily takes on the dominant red hues from the red peppers. The ingredients of Red Kroeung are: *Lemongrass stalk () *Turmeric () *Shallot *Garlic *Galangal () *Dried red pepper These ingredients require some advance preparation prior to pounding into this specific kroeung. The dried chili pod must be soaked, seeded, and then drained of excess water. The lemongrass stalks need to be thinly sliced and fresh galangal should be diced. If fresh or brine-soaked turmeric is used, it must be diced as well. Kaffir lime zest must be sliced into thin strips and Kaffir lime leaves require deveining and thinly chopping. The ingredients are then added to the mortar and pounded, usually lime zest/leaves first until smooth, then chili, lemongrass, galangal, and turmeric, until a deep red color is achieved. Lastly, the garlic and shallots are added. =Green Kroeung= Teuk Krueng (), vegetable platter with prahok kroeung dipping paste. The usual ingredients for a green kroeung are lemongrass (about a three to one ratio of leaves to stalks), rhizome, cinnamon, galangal and turmeric. Prahok can also be added depending on the dish to be made. A version with prahok, minus the cinnamon, is called teuk krueng and used as a dipping condiment for fresh or slightly blanched vegetables eaten with rice either as a side dish or as a meal in itself. =Yellow Kroeung= The yellow kroeungs are used often in common everyday dishes, a primary example being the ubiquitous samlor machu kroeung, a stew made with a yellow kroeung base that becomes greenish when cooked, fatty pieces of pork (usually ribs), tralach (wintermelon), papaya or tamarind for sourness and trakuon (waterspinach). The primary coloring ingredient for yellow kroeung is turmeric. To this is added lemongrass stalks, garlic, shallot and galangal.

She was heard often on radio during the 1940s and 1950s. Early years Carson was born in New York City and grew up in the Bronx, graduating from James Monroe High School. After graduation, she took a position as typist and stenographer, and she worked at a candy company. Radio In 1946, while still in her teens, Carson won an audition to the radio program Stairway to the Stars. This gave her a chance to perform for eight months in 1947 with Paul Whiteman's band and singer Martha Tilton, stars of the program. She joined the singing bandleader Harry Cool that year and made a number of recordings with him, one of which, \\"Rumors Are Flying\\", made the charts. Although she failed to score a chart hit recording during the next four years, she did receive much radio exposure. She was heard on Guy Lombardo's syndicated program in the late 1940s and her own variety program which began on the CBS Network in 1949. She also had her own thrice-weekly program, sponsored by the U.S. Army, in 1950. She was widely promoted as one of the guests on the November 5, 1950 premiere of NBC's The Big Show, hosted by Tallulah Bankhead. Television Beginning in 1949, Carson was a regular for two years on Florian Zabach's NBC television variety program. On December 30, 1952 she began the Mindy Carson Show, sponsored by Embassy cigarettes, on NBC. Recordings In 1949, Carson signed with RCA Victor. Although her initial recordings for RCA Victor failed to sell well, the success of Eileen Barton's novelty hit \\"If I Knew You Were Coming I'd've Baked a Cake\\" prompted the company to try a similar recording for Mindy Carson. Her recording of \\"Candy and Cake\\" was backed with \\"My Foolish Heart\\" and the record became a rare two-sided hit. However, after a number of unsuccessful follow-up recordings, RCA Victor dropped her in 1952. Carson then moved to Columbia Records, and her duet with Guy Mitchell, \\"Cause I Love You That's-A-Why\\", climbed on the charts to the top 25. She also guest-starred on ABC's 1957 series The Guy Mitchell Show. \\"All the Time and Everywhere\\", a big hit in the United Kingdom for Dickie Valentine, went nowhere for Carson and other U.S. recording artists. A cover of The Gaylords' big hit \\"Tell Me You're Mine\\" charted at #22, and a few others made the top 30 in 1952, 1953 and 1954. Her song \\"Memories Are Made of This\\" with the Ray Conniff Orchestra was issued in 1955. In August 1955 she scored a hit when her recording of \\"Wake the Town and Tell the People\\" reached #13, despite the fact that the trends in popular music were moving to Rock'n'Roll and she was not generally a rock singer. Carson had a minor hit with \\"The Fish\\", the single prior to \\"Wake The Town...\\", which was a mild rocker based on a proposed dance craze. The record appeared in both the Cashbox and Music Vendor retail surveys. She had only one more hit, Ivory Joe Hunter's \\"Since I Met You Baby\\" in 1957. By 1960, her recording career was over. Broadway In 1958 she appeared on Broadway in The Body Beautiful by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, their first musical collaboration. Carson returned to Broadway in the 1960s in two comedies, Mary, Mary (1961‚Äì64) and Dinner at Eight (1966-67). Clubs In 1949, Carson became the youngest performer to receive top billing at New York City's Copacabana nightclub. She also performed at clubs in New Orleans, Baltimore, and other cities. Personal life Carson married music publisher Eddie Joy in September 1949. They had three daughters, Jenny, Jody and Cathy.

It is also known as Kapelmuur, Muur-Kapelmuur or simply Muur. The hill starts near the river Dender at 18 m and reaches the top of the Oudenberg at 110 m after 1,075 m at 9.3 per cent. This climb is often part of the Tour of Flanders professional cycling race.  Tour of Flanders  The Muur van Geraardsbergen has often been a climb in the Tour of Flanders. It has been used since 1950, although not consistently until 1970. The \\"Muur\\" was the final climb in 1973 and 1974, before the finish in Meerbeke. An extra stretch to the chapel ('kapel' in Dutch) at the summit was added in 1981 and climb became known as the \\"Muur-Kapelmuur\\". It was a regular feature from 1981 until 2011. From 1988 until 2011 it was the penultimate, and often decisive, climb and always followed by the Bosberg before the finish in Meerbeke. The Muur was removed from the 2012 race. With the finish in Oudenaarde, instead of Meerbeke, it was no longer possible to include it while the race was starting from Bruges. When the start was moved to Antwerp for the 2017 race, the Muur was returned to the course, albeit as the eighth climb of the day, approximately 95km from the finish.  Other cycling races  The Muur was climbed in the 1960 Gent‚ÄìWevelgem and in 49 editions of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. Since 2019, the Muur is the penultimate climb in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. The Tour de France visited the Muur in 2004 but did not climb the actual Muur of Geraardsbergen. After omission of the Muur from the Tour of Flanders, it was announced that the climb would be in the 2012 E3 Prijs Vlaanderen, although not in the final. The Muur was announced as the centerpiece of the final stage of the Eneco Tour for 2012, 2013, 2014. Geraardsbergen and possibly the Muur will be in a stage for the next five years.

Slow slip events are distinguished from earthquakes by their propagation speed and focus. In slow slip events, there is an apparent reversal of crustal motion, although the fault motion remains consistent with the direction of subduction. ETS events themselves are imperceptible to human beings and do not cause damage. Discovery Structure of the Cascadia subduction zone. The Juan de Fuca Plate is subducting northeastward under the North American Plate. Nonvolcanic, episodic tremor was first identified in southwest Japan in 2002. Shortly after, the Geological Survey of Canada coined the term \\"episodic tremor and slip\\" to characterize observations of GPS measurements in the Vancouver Island area. Vancouver Island lies in the eastern, North American region of the Cascadia subduction zone. ETS events in Cascadia were observed to reoccur cyclically with a period of approximately 14 months. Analysis of measurements led to the successful prediction of ETS events in following years (e.g., 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007). In Cascadia, these events are marked by about two weeks of 1 to 10 Hz seismic trembling and non-earthquake (\\"aseismic\\") slip on the plate boundary equivalent to a magnitude 7 earthquake. (Tremor is a weak seismological signal only detectable by very sensitive seismometers.) Recent episodes of tremor and slip in the Cascadia region have occurred down-dip of the region ruptured in the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Since the initial discovery of this seismic mode in the Cascadia region, slow slip and tremor have been detected in other subduction zones around the world, including Japan and Mexico. Slow slip is not accompanied by tremor in the Hikurangi Subduction Zone. Every five years a year-long quake of this type occurs beneath the New Zealand capital, Wellington. It was first measured in 2003, and has reappeared in 2008 and 2013. Characteristics =Slip behaviour= GPS measurements from Victoria, British Columbia show periodic reversals in crustal deformation in the North American region of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. In the Cascadia subduction zone, the Juan de Fuca Plate, a relic of the ancient Farallon Plate, is actively subducting eastward underneath the North American Plate. The boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates is generally \\"locked\\" due to interplate friction. A GPS marker on the surface of the North American plate above the locked region will trend eastward as it is dragged by the subduction process. Geodetic measurements show periodic reversals in the motion (i.e., westward movement) of the overthrusting North American Plate. During these reversals, the GPS marker will be displaced to the west over a period of days to weeks. Because these events occur over a much longer duration than earthquakes, they are termed \\"slow slip events\\". Slow slip events have been observed to occur in the Cascadia, Japan, and Mexico subduction zones. Unique characteristics of slow slip events include periodicity on timescales of months to years, focus near or down-dip of the locked zone, and along-strike propagation of 5 to 15 km/d. In contrast, a typical earthquake rupture velocity is 70 to 90% of the S-wave velocity, or approximately 3.5 km/s. Because slow slip events occur in subduction zones, their relationship to megathrust earthquakes is of economic, human, and scientific importance. The seismic hazard posed by ETS events is dependent on their focus. If the slow slip event extends into the seismogenic zone, accumulated stress would be released, decreasing the risk of a catastrophic earthquake.Rubinstein, J., Shelly, D., Ellsworth, W. (2010), \\"Non-volcanic Tremor: A Window into the Roots of Fault Zones\\", in New Frontiers in Integrated Solid Earth Sciences, edited by S. Cloetingh and J. Negendank, pp. 287‚Äì314, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., However, if the slow slip event occurs down-dip of the seismogenic zone, it may \\"load\\" the region with stress. The probability of a great earthquake (moment magnitude scale M_w \\\\geq 8.0) occurring has been suggested to be 30 times greater during an ETS event than otherwise, but more recent observations have shown this theory to be simplistic. One factor is that tremor occurs in many segments at different times along the plate boundary; another factor is that rarely have tremor and large earthquakes been observed to correlate in timing . =Tremor= Slow slip events are frequently linked to non-volcanic seismological \\"rumbling\\", or tremor. Tremor is distinguished from earthquakes in several key respects: frequency, duration, and origin. Seismic waves generated by earthquakes are high-frequency and short-lived. These characteristics allow seismologists to determine the hypocentre of an earthquake using first-arrival methods. In contrast, tremor signals are weak and extended in duration. Furthermore, while earthquakes are caused by the rupture of faults, tremor is generally attributed to underground movement of fluids (magmatic or hydrothermal). As well as in subduction zones, tremor has been detected in transform faults such as the San Andreas. In both the Cascadia and Nankai subduction zones, slow slip events are directly associated with tremor. In the Cascadia subduction zone, slip events and seismological tremor signals are spatially and temporally coincident, but this relationship does not extend to the Mexican subduction zone. Furthermore, this association is not an intrinsic characteristic of slow slip events. In the Hikurangi Subduction Zone, New Zealand, episodic slip events are associated with distinct, reverse-faulted microearthquakes. Two types of tremor have been identified: one associated with geodetic deformation (as described above), and one associated with 5 to 10 second bursts excited by distant earthquakes. The second type of tremor has been detected worldwide; for example, it has been triggered in the San Andreas Fault by the 2002 Denali earthquake and in Taiwan by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake. Geological interpretation Tremor is commonly associated with the underground movement of magmatic or hydrothermal fluids. As a plate is subducted into the mantle, it loses water from its porespace and due to phase changes of hydrous minerals (such as amphibole). It has been proposed that this liberation of water generates a supercritical fluid at the plate interface, lubricating plate motion. This supercritical fluid may open fractures in the surrounding rock, and that tremor is the seismological signal of this process. Mathematical modelling has successfully reproduced the periodicity of episodic tremor and slip in the Cascadia region by incorporating this dehydration effect. In this interpretation, tremor may be enhanced where the subducting oceanic crust is young, hot, and wet as opposed to older and colder. However, alternative models have also been proposed. Tremor has been demonstrated to be influenced by tides or variable fluid flow through a fixed volume. Tremor has also been attributed to shear slip at the plate interface. Recent contributions in mathematical modelling reproduce the sequences of Cascadia and Hikurangi (New Zealand), and suggest in-situ dehydration as the cause for the episodic tremor and slip events.

Its aim is to facilitate quick review, rating and annotation of large quantities of digital images in the early steps of the digital workflow, with an emphasis on simplicity and speed. As an app with a freemium license, a basic version is available cost-free for personal, non-profit or educational uses, while a commercial license is required for the professional version with additional features. The basic version starts as a full version trial.  Features  FastPictureViewer is optimized for full-screen, borderless preview of digital images. It covers a limited number of scenarios, such as for example the initial pre-selection and rating of a relatively small number of images from a large set of potentially thousands (\\"culling\\"). The program has no image editing or image enhancement features and does not create and maintain a thumbnail database (it uses the system-provided thumbnail cache on Windows Vista or later), on the other hand it can browse deeply nested folder/subfolder trees containing many thousand images quickly and in a simple manner; the user interface is kept to the strict minimum and the program relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts.FastPictureViewer Professional Cheat Sheet (keyboard shortcuts help) The software has been dubbed \\"the Porsche of image viewers\\" and described as \\"unbeatably fast\\" by German magazine c't Magazin f√ºr ComputertechnikArtikel aus c't 19/08, S.162, zu FastPictureViewer 1.0 (the program also appeared in the magazine's software collectionSoftware- Kollektion 6/08, c't 19/08 and in a subsequent article on Adobe DNG raw workflow software roundupc't-Archiv, 5/2009, Seite 174 ). According to the publisher the program features full color management, including support for custom-profiled wide-gamut monitors and ICCv2 and ICCv4 profile formats. Image rating is supported using industry-standard conventions (Adobe XMP), along with image pre-loading and caching if computer resources allows (the 64-bit edition of the program takes advantage of the memory than can be present beyond the 4GB boundary). The program can make use of multi-core CPUs for parallel image loading. It uses DirectX hardware acceleration when available to accelerate zooming and panning, black & white preview and lost shadows / lost highlights views, and can also downsize very large images (e.g. astronomic pictures) to make them fit in video memory or computer RAM if necessary. The software also features an IPTC metadata editorIPTC Web - Software supporting IPTC Photo Metadata standards letting users annotate pictures (add or edit headline, caption, keywords, author and copyright information) in a way that is compatible with established industry standards. New images can be added to the browsed folder(s) and the program catches them on the fly, allowing continued browsing without the need to exit and reload the folder(s), while a tracking mode can automatically displays that last image added to the folder tree, useful when photographing in tethered mode or with a Wi-Fi enabled camera that transfers images to a computer using PTP or FTP, so images can be displayed as they are shot. An automatic advance mode (simple slide show) is also provided, along with a navigation slider that can be used to jump to different places in the current image list (under Windows Vista or later, the navigation slider displays a thumbnail image picturing the target location; a thumbnail strip is also displayed at the top of the program's window). The program supports the Unicode international character set (so it can browse images and folders whose names are written in any language) and features a multi-lingual user-interface. It integrates with the Windows shell, for example for context menus and AutoPlay events. It provides a simple external program launcher and a file copy function that copies (or moves) the image currently displayed to a pre-set folder, by pressing a hotkey, along with a file renaming function. Real-time RGB histogram and Exif information (shutter speed, F-stop, ISO speed, exposure compensation, ...) can be displayed in floating windows. The program adapts to screen resolution and supports large fonts and high-DPI display modes, as well as relatively low resolution Netbooks and sub-notebooks screens. The program integrates with the Windows 7 and 8.x taskbars and exposes a list of recently used folders through a mechanism known as \\"jump lists\\", introduced in Windows 7. An entry-level version of the program is available free of charge for home, non-commercial use. This free version supports the JPEG and Microsoft HD Photo / JPEG-XR image formats and can read/write Adobe XMP rating metadata in external sidecar files (*.xmp) or embed it within JPEG (JFIF), HD Photo and TIFF containers. FastPictureViewer is extensible via COM-based plug-ins, whose specifications are available from the software publisher upon request. The software adopts the user's language automatically (currently available for Brazilian/Portuguese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish). In addition to the core functionality of the cost-free version, the commercial version is said by its publisher to have exclusive features, such as: * Support for web and Windows image formats such as PNG and GIF with transparency, BMP, and ICO. * Support for TIFF, MTIFF (multi-page TIFF), CMYK TIFF, TGA and DjVu. * RAW formats previewing with color-management. * Support for persistent bookmarks working across viewing sessions. * Support for multi-cameras tethered shooting (MTP/PTP over USB 2.0 or WI-FI). * Ability to configure more than one external tool in the program launcher. * Ability to create and use preset renaming templates. * Batch file mark/delete function. * Batch file management functions (copy, move, delete, save-for-web) through a multi-function rule-based plug-in. * Batch IPTC metadata editing (apply headline, caption, keywords, author and copyright information to a set of images). * Batch Web publishing and local export (publish photos to photo-sharing websites or to a local drive or USB storage device). * \\"Geo-clustering\\" (group images into folders according to their spatial or temporal proximity). * Support for Controlled Vocabularies with assisted keyword entry in the IPTC Editor.Taxonomies, Structured Keywords, Controlled Vocabularies support in FastPictureViewer Professional * Support for Reverse Geocoding in the IPTC EditorReverse-geocoding support in FastPictureViewer Professional allowing users to fill the IPTC Location information from geotagged images. = Color management = By default the program uses the ICM 2.0 color engine (based on LinoColorCMM from Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AGColor Management in Windows 98, 2000 and XP: LinoColorCMM ) built into the Windows operating system since Windows 98. Users of the registered commercial version have the option to use the new WCS 1.0 color engine available on Windows VistaNew Color Management System for Windows Vista and later operating systems, instead of the default engine. This new color engine is based on Canon's Kyuanos technology and is said to use greater than 16-bit per channel floating point arithmeticsWhat's New in Version 1.0 of WCS for better gamut-mapping models that are meant to provide superior color space conversions than ICC rendering intents. FastPictureViewer Professional can optionallyColor-management support in FastPictureViewer use the new high precision color engine available in modern versions of Windows, for potentially more accurate color viewing on profiled display monitors. = Batch processing = Batch file processing is provided in the registered edition through a plug-in extension dubbed File UtilitiesFile Utilities Plugin Tutorial which provides rule-based point-and-click file management. Files can be selected from a number of parameters including Exif data, GPS position, speed, heading or altitude, file type, size, orientation, XMP rating, or dates. Actions can be performed on the selected files includes batch renaming, copy, move, delete, set rating, export to JPEG, send to FTP server. = Batch metadata editing = An IPTC metadata editor plug-inIPTC editor plug-in tutorial is provided with search-as-you-type dictionary-assisted keyword entryDictionary-assisted Keyword Entry and GPS reverse-geocoding.GPS reverse- geocoding in the IPTC Editor All IPTC Core fields are implemented and the data can be embedded within standard image formats (JPEG, TIFF) either as IIM or IPTC4XMP, as well as written to industry-standard Adobe XMP sidecar files. = Publishing = The web publishing subsystemUsing the web publishing sybsystem included in the registered edition allow users to upload photos directly to photo-sharing websites such as SmugMug, Zenfolio, PhotoShelter or a local hard disk or USB drive. The publishing function is able to perform on-the-fly format conversions to JPEG when necessary (so it can seamlessly publish RAW, TIFF and CGI files such as OpenEXR, DDS etc. to websites that normally don't support these formats), as well as automatic color-space conversion to sRGB for consistent color viewing across web browsers and devices. Users can control the type of metadata included in published JPEG files: Exif, XMP, IPTC, GPS and copyright information can be enabled or disabled individually. Files can optionally be recompressed on-the-fly to optimize the upload size, or scaled-down to a specified dimension for screen viewing or printing at a given size. The publishing system can upload files to multiple web sites simultaneously, each with their own parameters and settings: it is for example possible to upload original files to a site and downscaled copies to another web site at the same time. Site-specific functionality, such as for example SmugMug's SmugVault storage facility, are fully supported. = Smart auto- grouping = The Smart Auto-GroupingUsing the Smart Auto-Grouping plug-in plug-in clusters images into folders according to their spatial or temporal proximity. Assuming the images are timestamped (e.g. contains a Date Taken Exif tag) the user can specify a time interval, for example one hour, and the geo-clustering plug-in will look at the currently viewed set of images and group together pictures taken within up to one hour from each others, forming \\"clusters\\" of \\"nearby\\" images. Similarly, images containing Exif GPS location informationExif GPS Tags can be grouped together according to a user-specified distance criteria. This feature does not requires a reference point (i.e. it does not \\"search\\" for images taken near a given time or near a given location) but instead looks at the time taken or location of all images together, then finds groups matching the user-defined proximity criteria automatically.  Formats support  The program installs a set of WIC-enabled image decoders providing access to RAW formats from more than 400 digital camera models,https://www.fastpictureviewer.com/codecs/#cameramodels List of Supported Digital Camera Brands and Models Rawzor compressed Raw images, and DNG.FastPictureViewer's Image Formats Compatibility Chart The bundled raw image decoders also extends the Windows operating system by providing thumbnail views, metadata search integration and full viewing to Windows Explorer, Photo Viewer, Photo Gallery and, on Windows 7 or later, Windows Media Center. In addition to the built-in support for standard raster image formats such as JPEG, JPEG-XR and, in the licensed edition, TIFF, PNG, BMP and GIF, support for specialists image formats such as Photoshop PSD, OpenEXR, Radiance HDR, DirectX DDS, Softimage PIC, Autodesk Maya IFF, Silicon Graphics SGI, Netpbm PNM, PPM, PBM, PGM and JPEG2000, as well as 2D previewing support for Multi-Picture Object (MPO), Valve Texture Format (VTF) and JPEG Stereo (JPS) files can be added through the installation of separate image decoders. FastPictureViewer image codecs are also available as a separate product called the FastPictureViewer Codec Pack,FastPictureViewer Codec Pack (32/64-bit) which is referenced on the Microsoft Photography codecs download pageMicrosoft Photography - Download Codecs for Windows as well as on well-known technology websites.How to add Mac-like RAW image support to Windows 8.x (desktop), Windows 7, Vista, XPFastPictureViewer Codec Pack Adds RAW Support to Windows The codec pack enables read-only support for 40+ image formats in Windows Explorer, Photo Viewer, Photo Gallery and, on Windows 7 or later, Windows Media Center, as well as a number of codec-enabled applications, such as Sony Creative Software Vegas Pro, the IMatch digital asset management suite and more generally all applications compatible with Windows Imaging Component (WIC) codecs, which includes .NET Framework 3.x/4.x and Windows Presentation Foundation applications.

It has about 1,700 inhabitants. Administrative parts Villages of Chrastice, Kunƒçice, Nov√° Seninka and St≈ô√≠brnice are administrative parts of Star√© Mƒõsto. Etymology A first settlement was founded by German colonists in the 13th century, when the village was mentioned as Goldeck (\\"Gold Corner\\") for its gold and silver mines. The town has been referred to as Altstadt (\\"Old Town\\") since the 15th century. The Czech name \\"Star√© Mƒõsto\\" is a loan translation of the German denotation. The unofficial name of the town and official name of the town's train station is \\"Star√© Mƒõsto pod Kr√°lick√Ωm Snƒõ≈æn√≠kem\\" to distinguish it from other places called Star√© Mƒõsto. Geography The town is situated in the far northwest of the historic Moravia region, at the upper end of the wide Krup√° valley. It lies on the southeastern slopes of two mountain ranges ‚Äì the ≈önie≈ºnik Mountains and the Golden Mountains of the Eastern Sudetes, which form the border with Poland. The Kr√°lick√Ω Snƒõ≈æn√≠k peak lies about northwest of the town, outside of the municipal area. The Polish border is accessible via high Kladsko Pass (Kladsk√© sedlo), where the road leads downhill into the K≈Çodzko Valley. Paved road is not widely used and its construction has not brought the expected rise of tourism from Poland. History The rich gold and silver deposits caused a steep rise of population. In 1336 Goldeck was elevated to the status of a royal mining community by King John of Bohemia, the exploited metal was used for minting the Prague groschen. However, the deposits were mostly depleted around the 15th century. Moreover, the town was occupied by Hussite warriors in 1423 and totally destroyed in 1438 and again in 1480 by the local lord John Tunkl of Brn√≠ƒçko. These disasters finished the period of prosperity; the mines were abandoned. Lord V√°clav of Zvole supported developing of linen crafts in a half of the 16th century. His efforts were ruined in the Thirty Years' War, when Swedish soldiers burned parts of town down. However Altstadt recovered quickly and was established as a traditional local centre of a linen manufacturing during the 17th and 18th centuries. It became a border town, when the Prussian king Frederick the Great conquered the Silesian and Kladsko lands in the north during his Silesian campaign of 1740‚Äì42. Parish church In the 19th century the Buhl family of entrepreneurs founded a small factory processing flax and even cotton. Also enormous deposits of graphite were discovered, and Buhl was one of the first mining investors. Graphite was the most important product of Star√© Mƒõsto until 1977 when the last major mine was closed, however the mining kept on going up to the year 2011. A branch railway line along the Krup√° and Morava Rivers down to Hanu≈°ovice opened in 1905, served by the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways. A small antimony quarry was opened in the 1920s, which however existed only for short time. After the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, the town was strongly militarized in the interwar period due to its strategic position near the German border at Kladsko Pass. The Czechoslovak administration considered parts of the local German-speaking population as disloyal, wherefore public life was supervised by Czech officials and police. A visit of the nearby woods was able only with permission. This special regime caused strong anti- Czechoslovak moods, which increased after the Machtergreifung of the Nazi Party in Germany in 1933 and the rise of the Sudeten German Party under Konrad Henlein openly demanding secession. The \\"Pevnost Kronfelzov\\" (Fort Kronfelzov) was one of the biggest projects of the Czechoslovak border fortifications, until works were interrupted by the 1938 Munich Agreement resulting in German occupation. During World War II the town in Sudetenland was incorporated into Nazi Germany and its citizens had to serve in the Wehrmacht forces. All German town population was expelled in 1945. Abandoned houses were inhabited by Czech settlers from inner Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, by minorities from Volhynia and by refugees from the Greek civil war. The region of Star√© Mƒõsto lost its strategic military position as the former German territories in the northwest fell to Poland, therefore nearby woods could be exploited. The Communist regime nationalized farming and mining as well as manufacturing in 1948. Planned economy and new heterogeneous population, mostly without education, has made strong ongoing decay. New job opportunities were created in a paper industry. The town was occupied by Polish People‚Äôs Army troops in 1968, later replaced by Soviet Army forces. Small bases were established in the town's outskirts. The Czechoslovak Velvet Revolution in 1989 and the later economic transformation again caused national economic recession. The Star√© Mƒõsto region was hit heavily, when unproductive mammoth state concerns weren‚Äôt able to survive in market economy. The textile industry collapsed, the paper industry reduced production. The unemployment is the biggest problem of the region up to today. Demography Demographically it is a typical Czech municipality ‚Äì a strong Czech majority with a small Roma community.

The most important sector is tourism service. Several ski resorts are very close to the town. Another important economic sector is the growing of bioproducts and forestry. Rests of the graphite deposits are not recently mined. A successor of the former state-owned mining company bankrupted in 2011. Sights The main tourist attraction are the Church of Saint Anne, the Rennaisance town hall and remnants of the military fortifications. A museum is situated in the former military base, which also preserves the abandoned interwar forts. Culture The town has a cinema and an amateur theatre group. An annual event is the BioFest, a music festival focused on \\"bio-living\\" with local bio farms presentation.

Biography In 1987, Vincent Lagaf', who had just arrived in Paris, came to national attention as a comedian when he appeared on the TV show (La Classe) aimed at discovering young comedians. With his first one-man show, Lagaf' became popular thanks to the song \\"Bo le lavabo\\", which was a success in France in 1990. A year later, he had a similar success with \\"La Zoubida\\" which was in the list of the 100 best-selling singles in France during the 1990s. (A side-scrolling platform game developed by Titus Interactive based on this song was also produced, later altered and released as Titus the Fox in other markets.) Until 1995, working with the producer Herv√© Hubert, he continued to act in many sketches on stage or for television and to interpret new funny songs like Casse toi and Sweet Georgia Brown. In 1995, he played the part of Scipion in the play Le Surbook. In 1996, for French TV channel TF1, he began hosting game shows. In 1998, he adapted Let's Make a Deal for the French audience. He hosted Le Bigdil for six years with a virtual alien called Bill and his beautiful dancing girls Les Gafettes. With this show, he became one of the most popular TV presenters, twice an award winner, and a successful TV producer. In 2000, Lagaf' and Hubert sold their companies to Endemol. In 2006, Lagaf' stopped hosting and producing TV shows to take a sabbatical year. In 2008, he played the first leading role in the movie Le Baltringue. In 2009, after a tour with a new play Pourquoi Moi?!, he returned TV with a new version of The Price Is Right (Le Juste Prix), produced by Hubert who now works with Fremantle Media. In 2011, he hosted the French version of the English gameshow Ant & Dec's Push the Button. In 2016, Lagaf quit TF1.

His translations of medical treatises and fiction were an important contribution to early Renaissance Humanism in Germany.  Biography  Steinh√∂wel studied at the University of Vienna in 1429, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree on July 13, 1432, and eventually his Master's Degree in 1436. He moved to Padua in 1438 and studied canon law, but later devoted himself to medicine. He graduated in 1440. In 1442 he was an academic rector in Padua, and in 1444 he taught at the University of Heidelberg as rector magnificus. In 1449 Steinh√∂wel was a physician in Esslingen and a year later in Ulm. Sometime after 1460 he became the personal physician of Eberhard I, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Steinh√∂wel's fame comes from translating a legendary biography description of the life of Aesop and Aesop's Fables which he put into a Latin- German encyclopedic version called \\"Ulmer Aesop\\" first published in Ulm in 1476. In 1477-78 he published in Augsburg from G√ºnther Zainer a large edition of Aesop's Fables with many woodcuts. In 1480 he published a German translation of Aesop's Fables based on fables of Avianus, Babrius, Romulus, and Alfred which inspired other translations of later centuries in various languages worldwide. Steinh√∂wel also translated many works of Petrarch and Giovanni Boccaccio. In 1473 he published a translated version of Boccaccio's De mulieribus claris printed by Johann Zainer in Ulm.Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (Leipzig, Hiersemann, 1925), ref.

Bawdsey Ferry The Lady Beatrice carrying a horse and cart across the Deben Aboard the modern Bawdsey Ferry A ferry for foot passengers and bicycles across the River Deben between Felixstowe Ferry and Bawdsey, and provides continuity for the Suffolk Coast Path and Regional Cycle Route 41. The ferry operates from Easter weekend until the end of October on a varying timetable, and can also be used as a water taxi to moored yachts. Prior to 1894 the small passenger boats ran ferry trips. In 1894 Sir William Quilter, owner of Bawdsey Manor, established a steam-drawn chain ferry which the family owned until 1931. From 1931 until the start of WW2 Charlie Brinckley then operated a launch for passengers with his son Robert (senior). Bawdsey Manor was purchased by the RAF in 1936 to become RAF Bawdsey and the ferry was closed to the public during WW2. After the end of the war a daily service was operated until 1974 under contract to RAF Bawdsey and since 1974 it has operated on summer weekends only. The Bawdsey Ferry is mentioned in three Acts of Parliament, the 'Felixstowe & Bawdsey Ferry Railway Act 1887', the 'Felixstowe and Bawdsey Ferry Railway (Extension of Time) Act 1890' and the 'Felixstowe and Bawdsey Ferry Rly.(Abandonment) Act 1892' Butley Ferry A small ferry operates across the River Butley for foot passengers and for cyclists (no tandems) using Regional Cycle Route 41. It is operated by volunteers on Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays from 11 am to 4 pm within the season, which is Easter Saturday to 30 September. Telephone: 07913 672499 but no bookings. The ferry does not operate when wind is Force 5 or above. It is sponsored by the Alde & Ore Association. More information is available from the notice on the pier. The ferry claims to be the smallest licensed ferry in Europe. The Butley Ferry The ferry service was restarted by Bryan Rogers after a gap of 80 years and is now run by volunteers. Harwich Harbour Ferry Operates across the River Stour and River Orwell running between Harwich Quay and Landguard Fort near to the Port of Felixstowe and also to Shotley Gate on the Shotley Peninsula (summer only). Southwold to Walberswick Ferry The Southwold to Walberswick ferry across the River Blyth uses a traditional rowing boat. In 2017 it operated daily from the start of April to the first week of November, other than most of May and October when it ran on weekends only. Until 1885 a rowing ferry was used when a floating bridge chain ferry was started, initially hand-cranked ferry later being replaced by a steam ferry which ran until 1942 after improvements to the harbour made operation of the ferry too difficult. Frank Palmer then restarted the old rowing ferry and was succeeded by Bob Cross and David Church.

The Fiat‚ÄìRevelli 35 was an Italian machine gun, a modified version of the Fiat‚ÄìRevelli Modello 1914, which had equipped the Italian Army of World War I. Overview Italian soldiers aiming a Fiat-Revelli 35. The gun has an overall length of 1700 mm, including its 650 mm barrel. Unloaded, the gun weighs 17 kg, while the tripod weighed 23 kg. Like the Modello 1914, the Modello 35 is a complete weapon system made up of the machine gun unit, the tripod mounting assembly and ammunition supply, and therefore required a multi-person crew to operate. The Modello 1914 had seen widespread use during the World War I, but its flaws (excessive weight, water- cooling and its use of the underpowered 6.5x52mm Carcano) became more and more apparent as time passed; while the Italian Army was beginning to develop the new Breda M37, it was seen convenient to modernize the many Modello 1914s still existent. The Modello 35 opted for a more conventional belt feed, air- cooling, rechambering for the 8x59mm RB Breda and, after an unsuccessful attempt, discarding an oil pump to lubricate the bullets as on the Breda 30 light machine gun (but some sources claim that, as the Modello 1914, this weapon still featured this troublesome design, which is not mentioned in any of the technical manuals). Also, the machine gun was prone to the cook-off of the chambered rounds during the pauses of firing.The Italian Army 1940-45 (1): Europe 1940-43 By Philip S. Jowett, p. 13 The rechambering to the 8mm calibre and the adoption of a belt feed succeeded in improving both the stopping power and the rate of fire of the machine-gun; however, it reportedly suffered from jammings rather often.

It featured David Tennant as British scientist Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington, and Andy Serkis as Albert Einstein. This is the story of Einstein's general theory of relativity, his relationship with Eddington and the introduction of this theory to the world, against the backdrop of the Great War and Eddington's eclipse observations. It was first broadcast on BBC Two on 22 November 2008.BBC website for Einstein and Eddington Plot The prelude is set in 1919 on Eddington's expedition in Pr√≠ncipe to observe the solar eclipse that year, before moving back in time to 1914. At the outbreak of the First World War, Eddington is appointed chief astronomer at Cambridge by Sir Oliver Lodge and instructed to research Einstein's work and defend the Newtonian status quo. Meanwhile, Einstein is lured back from Zurich to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin in an attempt to aid the war effort by embarrassing Britain by disproving the work of its great scientist Isaac Newton. In Berlin, with his marriage already under tension, Einstein falls in love with his cousin Elsa. A Quaker and therefore unable to go to war, Eddington sets out to bid farewell to his friend William Marston, as the latter goes off to war as an officer, but just misses Marston's train. He then presents his lecture to his fellow astronomers at the university ‚Äî defending Newton, but still thinking Einstein might be right ‚Äî and takes the German M√ºller family into his home after saving them from a violent anti-German mob. When Einstein's wife arrives in Berlin, she discovers Einstein's affair and leaves him, whilst Eddington faces down protesters who despise his status as a conscientious objector. Einstein arrives late at a demonstration of Fritz Haber's poison gas and is so disgusted by this application of science to murder that he rejects an offer to convert his citizenship back from Swiss to German and refuses to sign the \\"Manifesto to the Civilized World\\", a list of prominent German scientists, artists and academics supporting the war. Eddington finds his research into Einstein's work obstructed by a British ban on the circulation of German scientific literature. Realising that Mercury's orbit is precessing slightly less than it should be according to Newton's laws, he writes to Einstein despite the ban to inquire into his view on the problem. Einstein's relationship with Elsa deepens, and on receiving Eddington's letter he starts work on this new avenue with Max Planck, whilst consoling colleague Planck on the loss of his son in the war despite Einstein's lack of belief in a human- like God or an afterlife. They find that Einstein's work agrees with Mercury's orbit where Newton's does not, and send this reply back to Eddington. At the same time, Eddington grieves over Marston, among the 15,000 killed by German use of chlorine gas at the Second Battle of Ypres, causing doubts in his faith, but leading him to fight all the more loudly against an expulsion of German scientists from the Royal Society. The expulsion has been initiated by Lodge, whose son was also among the killed and who clings to Newton as a consolation of \\"order in the universe\\", but Eddington is unable to admit to Lodge that he too is grieving for a loved one. News of the gas attack also leads Einstein to an outburst against his fellow scientists, which leads to his being cut off from the university, and ‚Äî overworking ‚Äî he falls sick and Elsa leaves him. Even so, he manages to complete his work on general relativity and on how starlight bends and gets this result through to Eddington via Planck. Eddington realises he can prove that space and light are being bent by observing the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 on the west African island of Pr√≠ncipe, and with Dyson as an ally, manages to gain funding for his expedition, despite Lodge's initial opposition. As the war ends, Eddington's sister and housekeeper, Winifred, sets off to help the Quaker relief effort in war-shattered Germany despite her fears as to Eddington's waning faith. The action returns to the Principe expedition, delayed by bad weather until the very last moment, while Einstein briefly returns to his ex-wife and children. Bringing back two photographs from the eclipse to compare to photographs of the night sky in normal conditions, Eddington compares them in public, with Lodge and Winifred in attendance, and not only proves Einstein right but also finds this confirmation reaffirming his faith ‚Äî as he states, \\"I can hear God, thinking\\". News of his vindication reaches Einstein, and crowds of press arrive at his door just as Elsa returns to him. A year later, in the closing scene, Einstein visits Cambridge and meets Eddington. The closing credits remark on both scientists' later work, Einstein's celebrity and Eddington's obscurity.

His best- known achievement is the invention and discovery of the properties of the Brocard points, the Brocard circle, and the Brocard triangle, all bearing his name. Contemporary mathematician Nathan Court wrote that he, along with √âmile Lemoine and Joseph Neuberg, was one of the three co-founders of modern triangle geometry. He is listed as an Emeritus at the International Academy of Science, was awarded the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques, and was an officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. He spent most of his life studying meteorology as an officer in the French Navy, but seems to have made no notable original contributions to the subject. Biography =Early years= Pierre Ren√© Jean Baptiste Henri Brocard was born on 12 May 1845, in Vignot (a part of Commercy), Meuse to Elizabeth Auguste Liouville and Jean Sebastien Brocard. He attended the Lyc√©e in Marseilles as a young child, and then the Lyc√©e in Strasbourg. After graduating from the Lyc√©e he entered the Academy in Strasbourg where he was prepared for the examination for entrance to the prestigious √âcole Polytechnique in Paris, to which he was accepted in 1865. √âcole Polytechnique and military years The √âcole Polytechnique. Brocard attended the √âcole Polytechnique from 1865 to 1867. As was the norm at the time, he, after graduation, became a technical officer in the French military, which had been reorganized in 1866. He acted as a meteorologist in the French navy, and general technician as well. Brocard soon saw active service, as Napoleon III declared war upon Prussia. Brocard was one of the 120,000 men under Marshal MacMahon led to Metz to free the French army of the Rhine. The French army, however, was defeated on 31 August at the Battle of Sedan, and was taken prisoner along with approximately 83,000 other combatants. =Middle years= After Brocard was freed, he returned to his military position and continued teaching, publishing his mathematical articles in the most popular mathematical journal of that time, (also called Nouvelles annales math√©matiques). He joined the Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France in 1873, just a year after its founding. In 1875, he was inducted into the French Association for the Advancement of Science as well as the French Meteorological Society. He was shortly after sent to northern Africa, where he served as a military technician for the French forces stationed in Algiers, the seat of French Africa. While in Algiers, Brocard founded the Meteorological Institute of Algiers. (3rd paragraph, reference to institute mentioned) Brocard also visited Oran while in northern Africa, which was occupied by the French in 1831. =Discovery of Brocard points= During a meeting of the French Association for the Advancement of Science, Brocard presented a self-written article entitled Etudes d'un nouveau cercle du plan du triangle, his first paper on the Brocard points, the Brocard triangle, and the Brocard circle, all of which today bear his name. =Later years= In 1884 Brocard returned to France. He served with the Meteorological Commission in Montpellier before moving to Grenoble and lastly Bar-le-duc. He honorably retired from the French military in 1910 as a lieutenant colonel. His remaining two major publications were Notes de bibliographie des courbes g√©om√©triques (1897, 1899, published in two volumes) and the Courbes g√©om√©triques remarquables (1920, posthumous 1967, also published in two volumes) which was written in collaboration with T. Lemoyne. Brocard attended the International Congress of Mathematicians at Zurich in 1897, Paris in 1900, Heidelberg in 1904, Rome in 1908, Cambridge, England in 1912, and Strasbourg in 1920. Brocard spent the last years of his life in Bar-le-Duc. He was offered the presidency of Bar-le-Duc's Letters, Sciences, and Arts Society, of which he had been a longtime member and correspondent for several foreign academies of, but declined. He died on 16 January 1922 while on a trip to Kensington, London, England. Contributions =Brocard triangle, Brocard circle, and Brocard points= A diagram of the Brocard point. Brocard's most well-known contributions to mathematics are the Brocard points, the Brocard circle, and the Brocard triangle. The positive Brocard point (sometimes known as the first Brocard point) of a Euclidean plane triangle is the interior point of the triangle for which the three angles formed by two of the vertices and the point are equal. Their common value is the Brocard angle of the triangle. The Brocard circle of the triangle is a circle having a diameter of the line segment between the circumcenter and symmedian. It contains the Brocard points. The Brocard triangle of a triangle is a triangle formed by the intersection of line from a vertex to its corresponding Brocard point and a line from another vertex to its corresponding Brocard point and the other two points constructed using different combinations of vertices and Brocard points. The Brocard triangle is inscribed in the Brocard circle. =Other mathematical contributions= Brocard published various other papers on mathematics during his time at Bar-le-duc, none of which became as well known as Etudes d'un nouveau cercle du plan du triangle. He also conjured up a famous unsolved problem thought to have no answers other than the three he provided. This problem is called Brocard's Problem. One other achievement of his is guessing at the meaning of the cryptic title of one of Girard Desargues' papers, DALG. In his paper Analyse d'autographes et autres √©crits de Girard Desargues, he surmised that it stood for Des Argues, Lyonnais, G√©ometre, which is the generally accepted title. =Meteorology= The University of Algiers administrates the Meteorological Society which Brocard founded. Though Brocard made no major notable original discoveries in meteorology, he founded the Meteorological Institute in Algiers and served as a meteorological technician during his time in the French military. He also published several notable papers on meteorology. See also *Brocard's conjecture Notes References * Reprinted in *Guggenbuhl, Laura.

He was known for reintroducing medieval ghazel style in Soviet Azerbaijani poetry. Life and creativity Aliagha Vahid was born on February 17, 1895 in a family of a carpenter. From his earliest years he worked as an unskilled laborer and helped his father. His received his first education in madrasah, but not finishing it, entered the literary society ‚ÄúMejmeush-shuara‚Äù. There he befriended such poets as Muniri, Azer Imamaliyev and other popular poets of Baku of that epoch. Under their creative influence he wrote his first lyrical poems. In his early satirical poems he criticized social deficiencies in the society, superstition and narrow-mindedness, tyranny and unfairness. These poems would enter his first collection of poems titled The Result of Avidity. Later, under the influence of Fuz√ªl√Æ‚Äôs and Seyid Azim‚Äôs works, he began to write ghazels. His ghazels were popular among people and that is why he was nicknamed Ghazelkhan. Wahid greeted the October Revolution and establishment of the Soviet power in Azerbaijan enthusiastically. He actively agitated for the Soviet power in his poems, such as To My Comrade Laborers and Soldiers, What Does the School Mean, Elevate, my angel... and others. In 1924 Wahid got acquainted with Sergei Yesenin, who was living in Baku, in Mardakan village with short breaks. Later this acquaintanceship turned into a strong friendship. This fact was mentioned in writer-publicist Huseyngulu Najafov‚Äôs ‚ÄúMay of Balakhany‚Äù narrative. After the establishment of the Soviet power and creation of the Azerbaijan SSR he collaborated with ‚ÄúKommunist‚Äù newspaper and satirical magazine ‚ÄúMolla Nasraddin‚Äù.

Being the follower of Fuzuli's literary tendencies, Aliagha Vahid was an eminent representative of the gazel genre in the Soviet culture. Aliagha Wahid was also engaged in translation of ghazels of Nizami, Fuzuli, Khaqani and other classics into Azerbaijani language.

He is credited with founding the YMCA of Oakland, and later, the YMCA of Los Angeles in 1882, which celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2007. History Merrill was born in Buffalo, New York, on November 15, 1856, son of Jerome Bonaparte Merrill and Jane Hughes. He was educated in the public schools of Buffalo and took employment with a Buffalo grain dealer. Due to his younger brother's health issues, Merrill accompanied his brother and their mother to California for treatment, arriving in Oakland on September 11, 1876. In 1888, he married Sarah DeEtta Dearborn in East Oakland. They had three children: Grace Edith (Jensen), Charles Arthur, and Wallace Dearborn. In 1876, Merrill began his own grocery business, but soon took employment with San Francisco bankers and brokers, Haley and Hopkins, becoming manager in 1878, and later becoming an officer in several corporations owned by Mark Hopkins. =Southern California= In late 1881, Merrill moved his business interests to Los Angeles, forming first the Merrill and Babcock Hardware company, then the Percival and Merrill Iron Company. In 1885 he bought out a book and stationary business calling it Merrill and Cook, which became the largest business selling school supplies in Southern California. In 1891, Merrill sold out to Cook and entered the oil and gas business. In the following ten years, the Merrill Oil Company is said to have been probably the largest business of its kind in the world, with tank wagons serving thousands of customers in an estimated 20 towns and hamlets.Greater Los Angeles & Southern California Portraits & Personal Memoranda, Lewis Publishing Company, 1910, P. 263 In 1901 he turned to iron and steel, organizing with other businessmen the California Industrial Company, capitalized at $2,500,000. Frederick Hastings Rindge served as President. Merrill served as Director and General Manager until becoming President in 1908. He was also a Director of the Western Gas Engine Company. In 1908, he was one of five delegates from the L.A. Chamber of Commerce to visit Japan. In July 1932, Samuel Ingham Merrill was struck by a car while crossing a street in Los Angeles and died. =Philanthropy= S.I. Merrill was heavily involved in Christian charities, helping to aid the poor and the homeless by providing both financial resources as well as direct involvement in leadership. He served as Chairman of the Board in the First Baptist Church and heading up its building committee. Additionally, he helped found the Industrial Home Society for homeless boys between the ages of eight and thirteen, which later became the McKinley Boys Home, in honor of assassinated US President William McKinley. Today it is known as the McKinley Children's Center and is located in San Dimas.McKinley Children's Center In 1885 he helped found the Baptist College, and in 1896 together with Lyman Stewart, was involved in the founding of the Pacific Gospel Union, later known as the Union Rescue Mission. He served on the Board of Directors of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles - known today as Biola University - along with T.C. Horton and Reuben Archer Torrey, former President of Moody Bible Institute.'Final Work on Bible Edifice,' LA Times, December 13, 1914 During the Great Depression, S.I.

He was also active as an author and set designer. Arroyo, who was born in Madrid, studied art in his home city, but left Spain in 1958 because of his basic contempt for Francoist Spain, came to terms with Francisco Franco in his old age, Arroyo later described him as a \\"whore\\" and even lost his Spanish citizenship in 1974 (which he got back two years later, a year after the death of the Caudillo). In Paris, he befriended members of the young art scene, especially Gilles Aillaud, with whom he later collaborated in creating stage sets, but also the old master, Joan Mir√≥. In 1964, he made his breakthrough with his first important exhibition. Over 20 years of great critical success and high esteem on the art market followed. In his old age, the ideologically and creatively uncompromising artist was as active as ever, even if it had seemed to have become somewhat quieter around his creations. Stylistically, Arroyo's mostly ironic, colorful works are at the crossroads between the trends of nouvelle figuration or figuration narrative and pop art. A characteristic of his representations is the general absence of spatial depth and the flattening of perspective. Arroyo also became known to a broad public through his many works as a set designer, as well as partially by his costume designs. In this relation, he cooperated since 1969 especially with the director Klaus Michael Gr√ºber, who encouraged him in this activity. Arroyo created sets for, among others, the Piccolo Teatro in Milan, the Paris Op√©ra (in 1976, Richard Wagner's Die Walk√ºre), the Schaub√ºhne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin and the Salzburger Festspiele (in 1991, Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's Z mrtveho domu). In 1982 he received Spain's National Award for Plastic Arts. Arroyo's stage play, Bantam, premiered at the Bayerisches Staatsschauspiel (Residenztheater) in Munich with great success in 1986, with his friend, Gr√ºber, as director and Ailland and Antonio Recalcati for sets and costumes.

The principle suggests that when an individual (the \\"helper\\") provides assistance to another person, the helper may benefit. Riessman's model has inspired subsequent research and practice by scholars, clinicians, and indigenous populations to address a variety of social and health-related issues plaguing individuals and communities around the world.  Riessman's formulation  Riessman's seminal article explored how nonprofessionals supported one another in self-help/mutual-aid support groups based on Riessman's observations of a sample of these groups, as well as his summary of the findings of research in the areas of social work, education, and leadership. This article suggested that although the \\"use of people with a problem to help other people who have the same problem in [a] more severe form\\" is \\"an age-old therapeutic approach,\\" the traditional focus on outcomes for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of \\"the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance\\" because \\"frequently it is he who improves!\\" (p. 27). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction at least has the potential to be mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the \\"helpee\\" to benefit in order for the \\"helper\\" to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide. Riessman posited several different mechanisms which may facilitate the benefits experienced by an individual engaged in a helping role: # gaining an improved self-image; # becoming more committed to a position through the process of advocating it (i.e., \\"self-persuasion through persuading others\\"); # experiencing meaningful development of abilities after having been given a stake in a system and learning through teaching others; # gaining access to a socially-valued role and the resultant sense of social status and importance; # enjoying opportunities to affirm one's own wellness following placement in a system as a role model; and # shifting one's focus from self-concerns and problems to assisting others (and thus distracting oneself from ongoing difficulties).  Health care  Lepore, Buzaglo, Liberman, Golant, Greener, and Davey (2014) investigated the helper-therapy principle in a randomized control trial of a \\"prosocial\\", other-focused Internet Support Group (P-ISG) designed to elicit peer-instigated, supportive interactions online among female breast cancer survivors. When compared to female breast cancer survivors who participated in a standard, self-focused Internet Support Group (S-ISG), which was not designed to explicitly provide opportunities for helping interactions to take place, analyses found that individuals in the P-ISG condition did provide more support to others yet P-ISG participants experienced a higher level of depression and anxiety following the intervention than those in S-ISG. These results fail to provide support for the helper-therapy principle which posits that \\"helping others is effective at promoting mental health\\" (p. 4085). In accounting for these results, Lepore et al. (2014) suggest that it is possible that women in the P-ISG condition felt hesitant to express their negative feelings out of fear that doing so might impact others adversely, whereas women in the S-ISG felt more able to unburden themselves of emotional pain and thus enjoyed better mental health outcomes. Arnold, Calhoun, Tedeschi, and Cann (2005) explored both the positive and negative sequelae of providing psychotherapy to clients who had experienced trauma and subsequent posttraumatic growth by conducting naturalistic interviews with a small sample of clinicians (N = 21). Although all interviewees indicated experiencing some degree of negative experience as a result of engaging in trauma-focused psychotherapy (such as intrusive thoughts, negative emotional responses, negative physical responses, and doubts about clinical competence), all participants also indicated some sort of positive personal outcome occurred as a result of assisting psychotherapy clients with these types of experiences. The positive reactions experienced by clinicians engaged in trauma work included: enjoying the gratification that comes through watching others grow and triumph following difficult times; increasing recognition of one's own personal growth and development; expanding ability to connect emotionally with others; impacting one's own sense of spirituality; increased awareness of one's own good fortune in life; and increasing appreciation for the strength and resiliency of human beings. This finding suggests that the helper-therapy principle may operate in a clinical context whereby therapists (i.e., the helpers) benefit from engaging in the process of providing treatment to psychotherapy clients who have survived traumatic experiences. Pagano, Post, and Johnson (2011) reviewed recent evidence examining \\"helper health benefits\\" among populations experiencing problematic involvement with alcohol, other mental health conditions, and/or general medical problems. In brief, their review suggests that when individuals with chronic health conditions (e.g., alcohol use disorder, body dysmorphic disorder with comorbid alcohol dependence, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain) help others living with the same chronic condition, the individual helper benefits (e.g., longer time-to-relapse, remission, reduced depression and other problematic symptoms, and increased self-confidence, self-esteem, and role functioning). Additionally, Post's (2005) review of the literature on altruism, happiness, and health indicates that \\"a strong correlation exists between the well-being, happiness, health, and longevity of people who are emotionally kind and compassionate in their charitable helping activities\\" (p. 73). However, Post also notes that individual helpers may become overwhelmed by over-involvement in the lives of others, and that giving assistance beyond a certain variable threshold may lead to deleterious rather than beneficial outcomes for helpers.  Social work  Melkman, Mor-Salwo, Mangold, Zeller, & Benbenishty (2015) used a grounded theory approach to understand 1) the motivations and experiences which led young adult \\"careleavers\\" (N = 28, aged 18‚Äì26) in Israel and Germany to assume a helper role and 2) the benefits they report enjoying as a result of helping others through volunteerism and/or human-service focused careers. Participants reported that observing role models involved in helping roles, being exposed to prosocial values, and having opportunities to volunteer within the system in which they were simultaneously receiving care all contributed to later assumption of more stable and regular helping roles. These participants felt obliged to provide assistance to others, desired to provide this assistance to others, and felt sufficiently competent to carry out the tasks required of them in their helping role. These participants reported that helping others provided them with a sense of purpose in their lives, and also increased self- efficacy, social connectedness, and ability to cope with personal issues. Additionally, participants reported that assuming a helping role provided a sense of normalcy to their lives, as well as providing a sense of perspective on their own journey and outcomes. As one participant (a volunteer with a police department who was assigned to work with at-risk youth) shared with the researchers: > \\"The fact that I could bring a runaway girl back to her home and I made her > trust me, the fact that I located a missing girl, the fact that I escorted a > rape victim to hospital and I managed to give her strength and support her, > these are the things that give me meaning, tell me that I'm in a much better > situation than others\\" (p. 45).  Self-help/mutual-help  Roberts, Salem, Rappaport, Toro, Luke, and Seidman (1999) found support for the helper-therapy principle among participants of GROW, a mutual-help group for individuals with serious mental illness, whereby \\"participants who offered help to others evidenced improvement over time in psychosocial adjustment\\" (p. 859). Maton (1988) reports that occupying both \\"helper\\" and \\"helpee\\" roles in a self-help/mutual-aid group (i.e., bidirectional support) was positively correlated with psychological well-being and positive perceptions regarding the benefits of group membership, and that these members with dual-roles had a greater sense of well-being and a more favorable opinion of the group than members who were helpees (i.e., recipients of assistance) only. Olson, Jason, Ferrari, and Hutcheson (2005) reviewed the existent literature on four mutual-help organizations (Alcoholics Anonymous, Oxford House, GROW, and Schizophrenics Anonymous). They suggest that the processes of change framework found within the transtheoretical model of intentional behavior change (Prochaska, Diclemente, and Norcross, 1992) is a useful model to conceptualize the activities of mutual-help organization members throughout their journey of mental health recovery. They explicitly link social liberation, the last of the ten processes of change articulated by the model (the others being: consciousness raising, self-reevaluation, helping relationships, self-liberation, environmental reevaluation, dramatic relief/emotional arousal, stimulus control, reinforcement management, and counterconditioning) to the helper-therapy principle, along with a related concept known as bidirectional support (Maton, 1988). Per Olson et al. (2005), social liberation \\"involves the person in recovery focusing attention away from oneself and developing a broader recognition of social issues that contributed to the targeted problem\\" which encourages \\"recovering individuals to take more helping-related attitudes toward others who face similar problems\\" (p. 174). In reviewing the research conducted among members of these four self-help/mutual-help organizations, they identify three different mechanisms which might underlie the therapeutic effect of mutual-help: (1) when an individual helps another, the helper's social functioning improves because the act of providing help to another allows the helper to work through their own difficulties; (2) when an individual helps another, the helper's social functioning improves because the act of providing help to another allows the helper to reinforce their own personal learning about recovery; and/or (3) when an individual helps another, the helper experiences an increase in their own sense of competence and usefulness to others and enables the helper to adopt a \\"strength-based roles that have not been fully exercised in other areas of life\\" (p. 175). In reviewing the research on GROW, specifically, 67% of members of this organization sampled by Young and Williams (1987) who were asked how they most benefited from participation reported that involvement in GROW \\"taught [them they] could help others\\" (the most endorsed answer among all listed categories). As suggested by a study by Maton and Salem (1995), this idea is most succinctly expressed by way of an axiom of GROW which is often recited at meetings: \\"If you need help, help others.\\" A review of empirical studies investigating the effect of mutual help group participation for individuals with mental health problems by Pistrang, Barker, and Humphreys (2008) provides \\"limited but promising evidence that mutual help groups benefit people with three types of problems: chronic mental illness, depression/anxiety, and bereavement\\" (p. 110).

Pokorn√Ω joined the army in 1924 and since 1926 attended the Military Academy in Hranice. After finishing the intelligence course in 1934 he was appointed an intelligence officer of the 12th division in Ko≈°ice and later in Pre≈°ov with the intelligence work aiming against Hungary. After the occupation of Czech lands and creation of the Slovak state he returned home. Like many other officers of the former Czechoslovak army he got a job in the protectorate administration and became a financial clerk of the Moravian land office in Brno. During the occupation he reportedly cooperated with several resistance groups, including the communists. His active resistance was later, during the show trials in the '50s, called into question. Instead he was accused of collaboration with the Germans. In April 1945, after the liberation of Brno by the Red Army, he took the control over the newly organized Czech police and in May he became a police commander in Moravia. During the summer of 1945 he and many others organized persecution and expulsion of Sudeten Germans. This included the so-called Brno death march. In July 1945 Pokorn√Ω joined the Communist Party and was appointed commander of one of the intelligence service sections of the Ministry of Interior in Prague. During the retribution Pokorn√Ω led the investigation against many of the German war criminals, but was accused of forging some testimonies and evidences to harm the communist opponents. In January 1951 Pokorn√Ω was arrested and in December 1953 sentenced in a show trial to 16 years imprisonment for sabotage, conspiracy, protection of former Gestapo agents and collaborators, and other activities, which supposedly hindered the work of the police. The sentence was quashed in November 1956 and Pokorn√Ω was released, rehabilitated and had his party membership restored. In March 1968, during the Prague Spring, Pokorn√Ω hanged himself in a forest near Brno.  References   Resources  * Karel Kaplan & Franti≈°ek Sv√°tek: Die politischen S√§uberungen in der KPC.

Bogar is an American lawyer and officer in the United States Army Reserves. He was a Guantanamo Bay attorney, for Abdul Zahir. Bogar was appointed to defend Abdul Zahir, an Afghan from the same guest house in Faisalabad where Abu Zubaydah was captured. He has been at Guantanamo Bay since then. Bogar made two trips Afghanistan, to help prepare Abdul Zahir's defense. Bogar reports that Abdul Zahir has been subjected to non-traditional interrogations techniques, including:\\"Hoods, loud music, putting him in extremely hot and cold rooms, strapping him to chairs in uncomfortable positions.\\" Bogar was an early proponent for trying terrorism suspects by adopting the rules for courts-martial---spelled out in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In 2007, LTC Bogar presented his lecture, \\"Guantanamo - Still a legal black hole?\\" at the Wisconsin Bar Annual Convention. After two years with the Military Commissions, Bogar returned home. Soon thereafter, he received an emergency call from his former client, Abdul Zahir, still in Guantanamo Bay. Abdul Zahir required emergency spinal surgery and requested Bogar's counsel and advice. This operation was referenced in a later op-ed by former JTF Commander. Following the successful operation, Bogar returned to Guantanamo one last time to visit with Abdul Zahir before his next military tour. Abdul Zahir remains in custody at Guantanamo Bay. In April 2009, Mr. Bogar's law review article titled \\"Unlawful Combatant or Innocent Civilian? A Call to Change the Current Means for Determining Status of Prisoners in the Global War on Terror,\\" appeared in the April 2009 edition of the Florida Journal of International Law. The foreword was written by Israeli Supreme Court Justice Eliezier Rivlin. Bogar returned home to his private legal practice in August 2009 following almost 5 years of active military service after 9/11. However, he is considered a terrorism expert and is often sought to speak. Following discussions on whether to try the 9/11 terrorists in the United States, Mr. Bogar published an opinion editorial in March 2010 opposing bringing any of the 9/11 terrorism suspects to the continental United States for detention and/or trial.

Half the building is occupied by the headquarters of the Great American Insurance Company. It is currently the third tallest building in the state of Ohio, and the tallest outside of Cleveland. Background Western & Southern floated the idea of constructing a tower for twenty years following the last construction boom in Downtown Cincinnati. In 2002 the project was revived. Plans called for a tower with over of office space. When the tower opened in 2011, it was , ending the Carew Tower's 81-year reign as the tallest building in Cincinnati. While the Great American Tower is taller than the Carew Tower, the latter building's roof is taller than the roof of the Great American Tower. The building was reviewed and approved by the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority which determined whether its parameters conformed to the outline in the Cincinnati 2000 plan for downtown including a final approval by Cincinnati City Council on June 12, 2008. Tenants in the building include American Financial Group, law firm Frost Brown Todd, law firm Vorys, Sater, Seymore and Pease and Western & Southern Financial Group. As of December 8, 2012, the tower itself is 90 percent leased. The majority of Western & Southern's space is located in the 303 Broadway portion of the complex. Design The building's architect, Gyo Obata, designed the building to include a top inspired by Diana, Princess of Wales's tiara. Gyo was flipping through books when he came upon a picture of Diana wearing a crown. \\"That's perfect. Here we have the crown of the building, and the nickname for the city is Queen City,\\" said Joe Robertson of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum remarking to Gyo when he first saw the picture. The building is constructed of glass and aluminum. The ground floor lobby interiors were designed by FRCH Design Worldwide. It has met with approval from Sue Ann Painter, author of Architecture in Cincinnati (Ohio University Press, 2006), who believes the skyscraper's headdress recalls the iconic Chrysler Building. She says that the building is somewhat conservative, but pays homage to the other skyscrapers in Cincinnati.

The PESA versions where also known as the Sokol.  Description  The Zhuk (Beetle) family of X band Pulse-Doppler radars provide aircraft with two modes of operation, air-to-air, and air-to-surface. The air- to-air mode of the Zhuk is capable of detecting targets and measuring their coordinates, range and speed. The radar has a look-down/shoot-down capability for air targets against a cluttered or water background and a variety of search modes are available. Individual targets can be tracked or multiple targets can be tracked and engaged at once while searching for new targets in track while scan mode. The Zhuk radar can identify detected targets by class and prioritise multiple targets for engagement. A variety of close combat scanning modes are featured including vertical scan, HUD view, boresight and slewable are available as well as locking onto a visually acquired target. The Zhuk radar also offers the ability to track and engage helicopters even when they are hovering. The Zhuk is compatible with a variety of air-to-air weapons including the radar guided R-77 and R-27 missiles to which it can provide targeting, target brightening and radio adjustment. The radar is compatible with optically guided missiles like the R-73 and can also provide fire control for aircraft cannon. In the air-to-surface mode the N010 radar offers a mapping capability using either Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), real beam or doppler beam narrowing modes with a resolution of up to 3x3m with zooming and image freezing functions. The radar can detect and track with measurement of range and speed both moving and static ground and naval targets. The Zhuk radar can support low altitude terrain following flying and can also detect dangerous weather patterns during flight. The radar is compatible with a variety of air-to-surface weaponry, including Kh-29 air-to-surface missiles as well as Kh-31 anti-radiation missiles.

The original Zhuk radar was only capable of air-to-air combat and never made it into service with the Russian armed forces due to the cancellation of the MiG-29M upgrade program. The Zhuk has a weight of 250 kg and uses a 680 mm electronically scanned slotted planar array antenna which offers a detection range of 90 km against a target with a 5 m2 radar cross-section (RCS). The radar can track 10‚Äì12 targets while engaging 2‚Äì4 of them with a scanning area of +/- 90 degrees in azimuth and +55/-40 degrees in elevation; its power output was rated at 5 kW peak. = Zhuk-8II = An export variant of the Zhuk radar developed for the Shenyang F-8-II Finback-B with similar performance to the Zhuk radar, only with a slightly reduced weight of 240 kg. Scan sector is +85¬∞ in azimuth and +55/-40¬∞ in elevation, with a range of 90 km against bombers and 70 km against fighters.

However, China did not chose this radar for their J-10 fighter and instead using their own design radar which is considerably better. = Zhuk-10PD = Zhuk-10PD is a further upgrade of earlier Zhemchoug also intended for Chinese J-10, with search range increased to 160 km (85 nm), and the targets that can be simultaneously tracked increased to 6. However, once again Chinese didn't choose this radar due to the successful development of their active phased array airborne radar (AESA) radar. = Zhuk-27 = Designed for the Su-27 but with similar tracking and scanning performance to the Zhuk radar, the Zhuk-27 weighed slightly more than the Zhuk at 275 kg but had a superior detection range of 130 km vs a 5 m2 RCS target. = Zhuk-M (Export Designation Zhuk-ME) = The N010M Zhuk-M is a further development of Zhuk radar. The radar forms part of the MiG-29SMT upgrade, the Zhuk-ME finding success on export MiG-29 aircraft to countries like India. The radar features improved signal processing and has a detection range of up to 120 km vs a 5 m2 RCS target for the export variant, and up to 10 targets tracked and up to 4 attacked at once in air-to-air mode. In air-to- surface mode the radar can detect a tank from up to 25 km away and a bridge from 120 km away, a naval destroyer could be detected up to 300 km away and up to two surface targets can be tracked at once. The radar has a weight of 220 kg and a scanning area of +/- 85 degrees in azimuth and +56/-40 degrees in elevation. The antenna is an electronically scanned slotted planar array and has a diameter of 624 mm. = Zhuk-MS (Export Designation Zhuk-MSE) = Zhuk-M radar developed for the Su-27 and its derivatives, the export Zhuk-MSE is suggested as being exported to China for use in PLAAF Su-30MKK aircraft. The antenna is an electronically scanned slotted planar array and has a diameter of 980 mm with a peak output of 6 kW. The Zhuk-MSE offers detection performance up to 150 km vs a 5 m2 RCS target with up to 10 targets tracked and up to 4 attacked at once in air-to-air mode. The radar has a weight of 275 kg = Zhuk-F/Zhuk-PH = An original Zhuk radar started in the late 80's featuring a passive electronically scanned array (PESA) antenna instead of a slotted planar array. The radar never made it into service or out of development despite being offered for export. Designed for the Su-27 the Zhuk-F had predicted 165 km ~ 140 km detection range against a 3 sq m RCS. Capability to detect 24 targets and track up to 8 with ability to engage 2 of them. Some sources note 24 targets could be tracked at once, and ability to engage 6 to 8. (It's possible that during development the target tracked and engagement capability had been increased.) The size of the PESA antenna was 980 mm. The radar had a weight of 275‚Äì300 kg and a scanning area of +/- 70 degrees in elevation and azimuth. = RP-35 = Is a development of Phazotron's first PESA radar Zhuk-F for original MIG-35. The RP-35 adopts the traditional linear radar field distribution typical among most PESA radars. The radar can simultaneously track 24 targets with a range against a 3 m2 RCS target 140 km head on, 65 km pursuit. The radar has an 800mm sized antenna, with volume of 500 dm3, and weighs 220 kg. RP-35 and similar PESA radars with traditional linear radar field distribution is no longer actively developed by Phazotron, which is concentrating on non-equidistant design, which Phazotron claims, offers a fivefold radar cost reduction. = Zhuk-MF (Export Designation Zhuk-MFE) former known as FGM29F AKA N010MF = Based and shares same technology as the N031 Sokol. Zhuk-MF use Phazotron's unique radial distribution arrangement in the backplane waveguide feed, and proprietary radiating element placement. Featuring a 700 mm antenna. The Zhuk-MFE offered initial detection performance of up to 120 km. With capability of tracking up to 20 targets and engaging up to 4 engaged of those at once. Zhuk-MF like the former Sokol is designed for high reliability, and is frequency agile with LPI and anti-ECM features. The radar has a weight of 285 kg Further work on Sokol/Zhuk-MF was stopped. = Zhuk-MSF (Export Designation Zhuk-MSFE) former N031 Sokol series = N031 Sokol series were originally separate radar family from Zhuk family. But were relabeled under \\"Zhuk\\" label. Offered for Sukhoi family and also as an alternative radar for the MiG-31 interceptor as opposed to the standard N007 Zaslon radar. Sokol/Zhuk-MFSE use Phazotron's unique radial distribution arrangement in the backplane waveguide feed, and proprietary radiating element placement. The Zhuk-MFSE offers detection performance up to 180 km vs a 5 m2 RCS target with up to 30 targets tracked and up to 6 attacked at once in air-to-air mode. The radar has a weight of 305 kg. The radar uses a PESA antenna, which has a diameter of 980 mm with a peak power output of 8 kW with 16 carrier frequencies. Sokol/Zhuk-MF is also frequency agile with LPI and anti-ECM features. = Zhuk-MA/MAE = The first incarnation of the Zhuk radar family featuring an Active electronically scanned array (AESA) based on N031 Sokol series was introduced in 2005 at MAKS. The Zhuk MA (MAE for export) used 1088 transceiver modules divide into 272 blocks and an antenna of 700 mm diameter. With a range of 200 km and ability to track 30 targets and engage 8 out of those. Was aimed for Su-27's and MiG-29's. However, the large size and weight (about 400~500 kg) it was deemed too heavy. (Official placard from 2005 MAKS contradicts this and puts the weight at 285 kg.) It could be that Zhuk-MA was confused with the first Phazotron-NIIR AESA of which only the antenna was shown at MAKS 2001 ) Internally also known as FGA01 = Zhuk-A/AE = The second incarnation of the Zhuk radar family shown at MAKS 2007 featuring an Active electronically scanned array were the Zhuk-A (AE for export). Two variants of the Zhuk-A's exist: the FGA-29, and the bigger FGA-35. the FGA-29 features a 575 mm antenna and 680 T/R modules. Was stated for initial stage performance to have a detection range of 120 km (Later advertised as 130 km) for 3m¬≤ targets and able to track 30 targets and engaged 6 of those at any one time.http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_o_no4M2xEPY/SZm57i3RJkI/AAAAAAAAGC4/rhd2DW2jbMw/s1600-h/DSC01637-773847.JPG Later the performance was raised to 148 km for detection and tracking and was expected to reach a detection range up to 250 km http://igorrgroup.blogspot.nl/2009/08/some-questions-about-fazotrons-aesa- are.html and had a weight of 220 kg (later advertised 200 kg) Work on FGA-29 was stopped. and the FGA-29 label was given to 1016 T/R modules FGA-35 radar. The FGA-35 featured 688mm antenna and 1016 T/R modules (originally planned 1064) with initial stage performance of a 200 km detection range for 3m¬≤ RCS target. Later detection range was raised up to 250 km.https://i41.servimg.com/u/f41/09/01/13/73/phazot12.jpg Able to track 30 targets and engage 6 of those at any one time. (Later reports mentioned capability of detecting 60 targets and tracking 30 with ability to engage 8 of those. Some western and Russian sources erroneously reporting 60 targets tracked instead of detected. ) The FGA-35 was later relabeled as FGA-29. = FGA-35(3D) = The FGA-35(3D) was first shown at MAKS in 2013. It's a GaN- based AESA, scalable, meant for various platforms with the version shown at MAKS having a 688mm(?) antenna and 960 T/R's. In an interview the new radar was mentioned to be weighing about 130 kg (for fighter planes)http://www.ato.ru/content/aesa-radars-growing-smaller and having a 200 km range for a 5-ton UAV version.http://www.ato.ru/content/phazotron-niirs- new-radars FGA-35(3D) was relabeled as FGA-35 while the original FGA-35 was relabeled as FGA-29. =Zhuk-AM/AME = In 2016 aerospace exhibition, held in Zhunhai Phazotron unveiled a new AESA radar named Zhuk-AM/AME which is likely further evolution of FGA-35 and renamed as Zhuk-AM/AME. According to Janes, the Zhuk-AME (or FGA-50) can track up to 30 targets and can simultaneously attack up to six aerial targets and has detection range up to 260 km, which is improvement of 50% compared with previously developed variants of the Zhuk radar. The source added that the new radar weighs about 100 kg. During 2015 Aero India Phazotron showcased a placard of Zhuk FGA-35, the radar in the placard looking like Zhuk-AM/AME instead of then FGA-35 (Which was besides the placard.http://i.imgur.com/rxvtSIH.jpg and was also marketed for HAL LCA https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O_AaDV71Z1c/V2MfedThVsI/AAAAAAAAK7c/_thnTc2gykIXnyf1K6q27Sar_DXbYau3gCLcB/s1600/Phazatron%2BJSC%2527s%2BZHUK- AE%2BFGA-35%2BAESA-MMR%2Bproposed%2Bfor%2BTejas%2BMk2%2BMRCA.jpg = Zhuk- AU/AUE = On-board radar system with active phased array antenna, made with the same technology as Zhuk-AM, standardized for installation on different types of aircraft including drones.

The murders took place in the home of Wayne Scott Anderson and Judy Anderson. Six people, comprising three generations of the Anderson family, were killed. Victims Six people were killed: *Wayne Scott Anderson, 60, a Boeing engineer and husband of Judy Anderson *Judy Anderson, 61, a postal worker, and wife of Wayne Scott Anderson *Scott Anderson, 32, son of Wayne and Judy *Erica Mantle Anderson, 32, wife of Scott *Olivia Anderson, 5, daughter of Scott and Erica *Nathan Anderson, 3, son of Scott and Erica Crime According to testimony, Joseph Thomas McEnroe and Michele Kristen Anderson armed themselves and drove their pickup to the home of her parents, Wayne and Judy Anderson, on the afternoon of December 24, 2007. Once inside, McEnroe distracted Judy Anderson, who was wrapping Christmas gifts, while Michele attempted to shoot her father. Michele's gun jammed, so McEnroe killed Wayne and then Judy Anderson. The two then dragged the bodies outside and carefully cleaned the home and waited for Michele Anderson's older brother, Scott, his wife, Erica, both 32, and their two young children to arrive. Once the family arrived, Michele Anderson shot her brother several times, killing him. McEnroe and Anderson shot Erica Anderson. Wounded, she managed to get to the home's cordless phone and dialed 9-1-1. The connection only lasted a few seconds and dispatchers heard what sounded to them like people arguing at a party. McEnroe was able to grab the phone from her, tore the batteries out of the receiver, and smashed it on the floor. McEnroe delivered the fatal shot to Erica, and he then shot and killed the children, 5-year-old Olivia and 3-year-old Nathan, at request of Anderson because they didn't want witnesses and said the children would be scarred for life having seen their parents killed. Police were dispatched to the scene in response to the 9-1-1 call, but the gate to the property was locked and the officers decided not to investigate further. The gate was only locked because Michele Anderson had run out to lock it after she realized Erica's 9-1-1 call went through. The bodies were discovered two days later, on December 26, when Judy‚Äôs best friend and co-worker Linda Thiele went to the home to see why she was absent from work. She looked in the window and saw bodies on the floor, so she called 9-1-1. She initially thought she was looking at the bodies of Wayne and Judy, but they turned out to be Scott's and Erica's bodies. While King County detectives were at the property in response to Thiele's 9-1-1 call, McEnroe and Michele Anderson drove up and were brought in for questioning. Eventually, both of them admitted to the murders and were arrested. Prosecutors told jurors the motive for the killings was money. Anderson alleges her brother owed her and she believed that she had been slighted and mistreated by her parents and brother. Arrests Arrested and indicted as the perpetrators of the killings were Michele Kristen Anderson (who was unemployed) and her boyfriend, Joseph Thomas McEnroe (a Target employee), both aged 29. They were each charged with six counts of first-degree murder. Michele is the younger sister of Scott and the youngest child of Wayne and Judy. The suspects waived their right to appear in court. Police say they confessed to the killings. Trial and sentencing McEnroe confessed to the murders in January 2014 in an effort to avoid execution. On December 19, 2014, a 16-member jury was selected to hear the case against McEnroe. On March 25, 2015, the jury found Joseph McEnroe guilty of aggravated first-degree murder on all six counts. On May 13, 2015, Joseph McEnroe was sentenced to life in prison, and avoided the death penalty, mainly due to a statewide moratorium on the death penalty by then-governor Jay Inslee. On March 4, 2016, Michele Anderson was found guilty of six counts of aggravated first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life imprisonment in April 2016. McEnroe is currently imprisoned in the Washington State Penitentiary and Anderson is currently imprisoned in the Washington Corrections Center for Women.https://www.doc.wa.gov/information/inmate-search/ References External links * Category:2007 in Seattle Category:Murder in Washington (state) Category:2007 murders in the United States Category:Mass shootings in Washington (state) Category:Deaths by firearm in Washington (state) Category:Mass murder in 2007 Category:2007 in Washington (state) Category:Crimes in Washington (state) Category:Attacks in the United States in 2007 Category:December 2007 events in the United States Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Familicides ","title":"2007 Carnation murders"},{"id":"14897821","text":"Strmilov () is a town in Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec District in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

The attraction opened on March 16, 2002 with the park. It was based on the 1998 Touchstone film Armageddon, which was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay. The principle was to demonstrate set effects, as in the film, within a full room using special effects. The ride closed on April 1, 2019, and the showbuilding will later be demolished for the Avengers Campus expansion to the 'Walt Disney Studios Park', as announced by Bob Iger in February 2018. Preshow The public entered studio 7-A or studio 7-B, where a Cast Member explained the part they are about to play in the shooting. After a pre-show presentation, which included a short history of special effects (from the early Georges M√©li√®s' films to modern blockbusters) and a speech from Michael Clarke Duncanhttp://www.photosmagiques.com/gallery/walt-disney-studios- park/backlot/armageddon-les-effets-speciaux/ (\\"Bear\\" in the movie), guests learned they will enter the recreation of the modified Mir from the film. Two main characters will join them: the central computer of the Station and Colonel Andropov. The films and spiel of both studios were identical, although they have different art work on display. The main show Guests then proceeded onto the set of the Station's main deck. As the show started with the director's call of \\"Action\\", several scenes ensued. Windows opening either on Space or on Earth let guests witness the arrival of a meteorite rain. As it hit the station, several dysfunctions occurred, including lights flickering, gas bursting into the cabin, the ceiling threatening to collapse and incandescent rocks crossing the room. At one point, the build-up of pressure in the pipes caused a part of the wall to be pulled out, letting air escape until a tight door closed. Finally, as guests could see the main meteor arriving on them, a powerful explosion occurs and lights go out. A voice calling \\"Cut!\\" closes the show. The whole attraction lasted about 22 minutes with a capacity of about 170 people.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Calgary, Alberta. Background Flower- class corvettes like Calgary serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Calgary was ordered 20 February 1941 as part of the Revised 1940-41 Flower class building program. This revised program radically changed the look of the Flower-class corvette. The ships of this program kept the water-tube boilers of the initial 1940-41 program, but now they were housed in separate compartments for safety. The fo'c'sle was extended, which allowed more space for berths for the crew, leading to an expansion of the crew. The bow had increased flare for better control in heavy seas. The revised Flowers of the RCN received an additional two depth charge throwers fitted amidships and more depth charges. They also came with heavier secondary armament with 20-mm anti-aircraft guns carried on the extended bridge wings. All this led to an increase in displacement, draught and length. Calgary was laid down by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel on 22 March 1941 and launched on 23 August of that year. She was commissioned into the RCN on 16 December 1941 at Sorel. During her career she had two significant refits. The first began in December 1942 after Calgary developed severe mechanical problems. She was forced to undergo a three-month refit at Cardiff which was only completed in March 1943. The second major overhaul took place between January and March 1944 at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Wartime service Four-inch gun on Calgary After arriving at Halifax 28 December 1941, she was initially assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). She remained with that force until November 1942. During that period, on 30 July 1942 Calgary rescued 71 survivors from the crew of the British merchant ship Pacific Pioneer that was sunk by southwest of Sable Island. In November 1942 Calgary was deployed to assist in Operation Torch, the amphibious invasion of French North Africa as part of the North African Campaign. However, after arrival in the United Kingdom she developed severe mechanical problems which led to an extensive refit. She only returned to service in April 1943, having never taken part in any duties connected to Operation Torch. Upon resumption of her duties she sailed back to Canada and rejoined WLEF in April 1943. In June 1943 she transferred to escort group 5, also known as the 5th Support Group, under Western Approaches Command. On 23 August 1943 Calgary, as part of the 5th Support Group, was deployed to relieve the 40th Escort Group which was undertaking a U-boat hunt off Cape Ortegal. The warships of both groups were attacked by 14 Dornier Do 217s and 7 Junkers Ju 87s that were carrying a new weapon, the Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship guided missile. Several sailors were killed and injured on (40th EG) but Calgary escaped damage. Two days later, the 5th SG was relieved by the 1st Support Group and the warships of both groups were again attacked by 18 Dornier Do 217s also carrying Hs 293s. was heavily damaged and was sunk but Calgary again escaped damage. Later that year on 20 November 1943 Calgary, along with and , depth charged and sank U-536 northeast of the Azores at . In December 1943, she transferred to the 6th Support Group, before departing for refit in January 1944. In May 1944, Calgary, after completing workups was ordered to the United Kingdom and in June 1944 was deployed to assist in Operation Neptune, the amphibious invasion of Normandy, France known as D-Day (Operation Overlord). In September 1944, she was reassigned to Nore Command and remained with them for the remained of the war. On 29 December 1944 Calgary depth charged and sank in the English Channel south of Weymouth at . Post-war service After the cessation of hostilities Calgary returned to Canada in May 1945 and was paid off from the RCN on 19 June 1945 at Sorel. She was sold for scrapping on 30 August 1946 and broken up in 1951 at Hamilton.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Halifax, Nova Scotia. Background Flower-class corvettes like Halifax serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Halifax was ordered as part of the Revised 1940‚Äì41 Flower- class building program. This revised program radically changed the look of the Flower-class corvette. The ships of this program kept the water-tube boilers of the initial 1940‚Äì41 program, but now they were housed in separate compartments for safety. The fo'c'sle was extended, which allowed more space for berths for the crew, leading to an expansion of the crew. The bow had increased flare for better control in heavy seas. The revised Flowers of the RCN received an additional two depth charge throwers fitted amidships and more depth charges. They also came with heavier secondary armament with 20-mm anti- aircraft guns carried on the extended bridge wings. All this led to an increase in displacement, draught and length. Halifax was laid down by Collingwood Shipyards Ltd. at Collingwood on 26 April 1941 and launched on 4 October of that year. She was commissioned into the RCN 6 weeks later on 26 November at Montreal, Quebec. During her career she had two significant refits. The first took place between May and October 1943 at Liverpool, Nova Scotia. The second began at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and was completed at Halifax. War service After arriving at Halifax 18 December, Halifax was initially assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). On 19 May 1942, Halifax rescued three survivors from the crew of the American trawler Foam which was sunk by gunfire by south of Halifax. In July 1942 she transferred to Halifax Force as an escort to tanker convoys leaving Aruba. In August she was assigned to TAW (Trinidad-Aruba-Key West) convoys. She took part in the only major convoy battle in the Caribbean Sea, TAW 15. In September 1942 she was placed under American control as an escort for convoys between New York and Guantanamo. She remained in this service until March 1943 when she rejoined WLEF. After departing for her first refit in May 1943, Halifax returned to service in January 1944 with the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) when she was assigned to one of their escort groups, C-1. She remained with this unit, escorting trans-Atlantic convoys, until August when she departed for another refit. After workups in Bermuda, she briefly joined Halifax Force in January 1945 before transferring back to MOEF as a member of C-9. She remained with this unit for the rest of the war. Post-war service After the cessation of hostilities, Halifax was paid off from the RCN on 12 July 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was transferred to the War Assets Corporation and sold later that year as the mercantile (salvage vessel) Halifax. The ship was deleted in December 1963.

The album reached No. 6 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. Album title Prior to the album's release, Atkins found herself at a bar her family frequented in Neptune City, New Jersey called Bilow's, thinking about what she would title her album. She pondered aloud naming the album Neptune City, almost as a counterbalance to Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., with encouragement from the bar's patrons. \\"And I figured Neptune City, too, it seems so ominous,\\" she told the Village Voice. \\"It sounds like very, you know, aquatic and mysterious.\\"Trucks, Rob \\"Nicole Atkins & the Sea: Possibly 4th Street.\\", villagevoice.com, January 25, 2008. Accessed on January 30, 2008 Though several publications have suggested the album's title refers directly to her hometown, the real life Neptune City is a distinct municipality just to the east of Atkins' native Neptune, New Jersey. Critical reception Neptune City was generally well received by most music critics. Katherine Fulton of Allmusic noticed that \\"Atkins shows on this album that she has both the capability and potential\\" and praised the \\"lush arrangements on Neptune City, which [...] showcase the depth, range, and versatility of Atkins' alto voice, not to mention her songwriting prowess\\". Chris Jones of BBC Music wrote that Atkins \\"delivers glorious, over-the-top twang-drenched ballads that both romanticise her native New Jersey and yet still throw in a tough, dark heart of country noir\\" and described the album as \\"something akin to country, but also something weirdly post-modern\\", while praising its production and vocals. Susan Frances of AbsolutePunk wrote that \\"the whole album is tooled with melodic patterned frescos combining orchestral fields with pop/rock elements\\" and added that it \\"does justice to the real Neptune City\\". Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly described it as \\"heartbreak nearly at its finest ‚Äî and most cosmopolitan\\" while Joanna Hunkin of The New Zealand Herald compared it to \\"an intricate oil painting\\" and called it \\"a collection of curiosities, revealing a new intrigue with every listen\\". Michael Keefe of PopMatters found the album \\"big and dreamy\\", the arrangements \\"vibrant, lush, and propulsive\\", and stated that \\"the instrumentation will swoop in and carry you along for a 40-minute ride through timeless chamber pop\\", but also noted that \\"the primal force that drives Neptune City is the huge and charismatic voice of Nicole Atkins\\". Will Miller from Music Emissions noticed that Neptune City \\"deals with that love/hate relationship almost everybody has with their hometown\\" and wrote that \\"with varied and lush instrumentation of strings and piano, the musical backdrops are full and rich throughout\\" and generally praised Atkins' vocal abilities. Suzanne Baumgarten of The Cornell Daily Sun felt that Atkins \\"has a folk song quality that makes her otherwise pop-like style unique and truly enjoyable\\" and called the album \\"optimistic, yet utterly realistic\\", while Under the Radar called it \\"a superb yesteryear sounding album\\". The album also garnered positive reviews from independent entertainment website IndieLondon, which found it \\"well worth checking out\\", and Greek webzine Avopolis, which described it as \\"an elegy for love\\". A fairly mixed review came from Stacey Anderson of Spin, who noticed that the artist \\"coolly distills the romanticism of '60s girl groups into dark, baleful country pop\\" but felt that \\"the songs swell and crest in identical structure, leaving her gorgeous voice [...] to battle the overproduction\\".

It begins with the narrator identifying himself as a ghost looking down on his own funeral ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see me from this view, all the way down, trailing the procession.‚Äù He says he'll ‚Äúhide out a few more days,‚Äù perhaps the mourning period for the remaining family, but then has to leave. The narrator seems to wish he could have a more positive outlook on the ‚Äúlandscape I was born to,‚Äù ostensibly the same town where his funeral now takes place. He thinks if he looked at it differently, it could ‚Äúmake me new again.‚Äù The chorus is divided between the narrator and the family left behind on Earth. In the first quatrain, the family's ‚Äúhearts are singing out‚Äù for the deceased. They are so bereaved that they sing a ‚Äúcemetery song‚Äù, but if they could figure out a way beyond their grief ‚Äì ‚Äúif we knew just what we could do‚Äù ‚Äì they could stop singing the cemetery song. The second quatrain finds the narrator assessing his current state, ‚Äúsitting over Neptune City‚Äù, wistfully acknowledging how much he misses it. He has one chance to briefly return ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come down, walk around a while‚Äù ‚Äì until his time is up and he's ‚Äúsure [he] can never go home again.\\" In a 2007 interview with The Star-Ledger, Atkins indicated the last quatrain could also apply to anyone looking back with ambivalence at their hometown. ‚ÄúAfter the fact, it took on all these different meanings about not being able to feel comfortable in the place that you always thought was home.‚ÄùLustig, Jay. \\"Greetings From Neptune City, NJ\\", \\"The Star-Ledger\\", October 27, 2007 Accessed January 24, 2008 Background Atkins told the Ledger, \\"I wasn't even planning on writing a song called 'Neptune City.' My sister and I were making pasta, and we were like, (sings) 'We're making pasta in Neptune City ...' Like, just kidding. And I was like, 'That (melody) sounds really cool.'\\" The lyrics were inspired by an uncle whom she never met. Long before Atkins' birth, her mother's brother died in an accident at the age of 13. Years later, Atkins found the uncle's Yamaha learner's guitar in an attic and used it to teach herself how to play.La Gorce, Tammy. \\"Born In New Jersey and (Now) Proud of It\\", The New York Times, July 29, 2007. Accessed January 18, 2008 Video The video, directed by David Simon, features fantastic scenes and dreamlike sequences set in a faded amusement area, with moving images of Atkins transposed on older still photographs. The intentional grainy and distorted look of the video evokes the old peep shows one would have found in early 20th century seaside resorts like Brighton or Atlantic City. It opens in a meadow of tall grass (with a barely visible Atkins to the left) and pans right, past an old roadside billboard. An image of the Roman god Neptune is briefly visible on the billboard before fading to black. The camera then moves in on the image of an old amusement park separated from the meadow by a body of water. From there, the camera zooms in on Atkins in color, transposed on a black-and-white image of the old Atlantic City Boardwalk. As she sings ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be leaving this place soon,‚Äù the picture changes to an image of rapidly deteriorating film but with a statue of Neptune clearly visible in the center of the frame, a reference to the namesake location. Later scenes show Atkins lying down across an image of Tillie and walking down a set of stairs onto the beach. As the video progresses, the images play in reverse, with the final scene returning to the meadow with the billboard and finally Atkins by the roadside before fading to black. Throughout the video, Atkins is the only person seen both in color and moving. The still photos may represent snapshots of a distant time the singer cannot bring back. They could also represent the world of the living, from which the singer is forever separated.

Originally Morpurgo thought \\"they must be mad\\" to try to make a play from his best-selling 1982 novel; nonetheless, the play was a success. The play's West End and Broadway productions are directed by Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris; it features life- size horse puppets by the Handspring Puppet Company of South Africa, with \\"horse choreography\\" by Toby Sedgwick. Synopsis A captured foal is brought to Devon in the United Kingdom to be auctioned. Hoping to give it to his son Ned, Arthur Narracott bids on the foal; instead, his brother Ted competes with him and bids 30 guineas‚Äîan exorbitant amount for the poor farmer, winning the horse. The local drunkard, Ted is considered to be a coward, for refusing to have fought together with his brother in the earlier Boer War in South Africa. At the auction, Ted used money reserved to pay his farm mortgage. Ted's wife Rose fears they will lose their farm. Their son Albert promises to raise the foal and train him for sale. The boy names the foal Joey, and forms a strong bond with him during training.. Jealous of his cousin Albert, Ned convinces his father to get Ted drunk and make a bet: if Joey (bred and trained as a hunter, not a plough horse) can be taught to plough within a week, Arthur will pay Ted 39 guineas, the auction price. If Joey won't plough, Ned gets the horse. Albert successfully teaches Joey to pull the plough and gets to keep him. News of the outbreak of World War I reaches Devon. When Ted sells Joey to the cavalry, Albert is crushed. Captain James Nicholls, who often sketched Albert riding the hunter, promises that he will personally look after the fine horse. At the same time, Arthur enlists Ned to fight despite his protests. Arthur gives Ned his grandfather's knife for protection. Joey and Topthorn (another army horse) are shipped to France. The charges of the British cavalry are overwhelmed by the fire from German machine guns, representing their new technology. During the first charge, Nicholls is shot and killed. Ned is assigned to ride Joey into battle and is captured by German troops. Topthorn and Joey, life-size puppet horses, at a production of the play in Australia Nicholls's sketchbook is sent to Albert, who learns Joey is serving \\"unprotected\\" in France. He lies about his age, enlists in the army and goes to France. There he befriends Private David Taylor, a fellow soldier. The Germans have taken Ned to a French farm being used as a makeshift hospital. He is killed brandishing his knife. Emilie, the girl of the farm family, is nearly killed in the altercation. German officer Friedrich Muller is reminded of his own daughter left in Germany. He and Emilie share a love of horses and, with Emilie's mother, they take care of the horses Joey and Topthorn, which are being kept to pull an ambulance for wounded soldiers. When a shell kills most of his comrades, Friedrich switches his coat and identity with an enlisted medic, hoping to survive to return home. His subterfuge is discovered but Friedrich enables Emilie and her mother to escape. When the Germans force the two fine horses to work as draft horses, Joey inspires Topthorn to pull in order to survive. Once enemies, the two horses become friends, but Topthorn dies from exhaustion. As Friedrich mourns the horse, a tank attack hits his group, killing him and driving Joey to run. He is caught in barbed wire in No Man's Land between the enemy lines. The Germans and British each send out a man under a white flag to aid the horse. Winning a coin toss, the British take the injured Joey back to camp. Albert and David's infantry division encounter Emilie, who is alone and traumatized; they take her to British headquarters. On the way, Albert sees a dead horse with Ned's knife in him. Believing that the horse is Joey, Albert is broken. Recognizing Joey's name, Emilie tries to talk to Albert, but David is shot and killed, and Albert temporarily-blinded by tear gas. Emilie does not have the chance to tell him about his horse. Behind the lines, in a British encampment, Albert tells his story to a nurse just as the damaged Joey is brought to the camp by soldiers. The soldiers prepare to kill the injured horse, but Albert whistles and Joey responds to him. Learning the full story, the soldiers agree to let Albert care for Joey during their joint convalescence. The horse and farmboy return home safe to Devon at the end of the war. Productions =National Theatre (2007‚Äì2009)= The maquette for Joey from the National Theatre production.

It was filmed naturalistically, with over 100 real horses (including 14 to portray Joey) and computer-generated imagery to support battle scenes. =War Horse at the Proms= On 3 August 2014 a special production of War Horse was presented at the Proms in the Royal Albert Hall, London, as Prom 22, with Adrian Sutton's music played by the BBC Concert Orchestra, and the cast and puppets of the show performing on stage. This was televised live by the BBC, and repeated on BBC on Boxing Day (26 December) 2014. In popular culture Saturday Night Live spoofed War Horse on an episode aired 17 December 2011. The sketch features a British couple (played by Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig) attending a regional production of War Horse. Instead of a life-size horse puppet, the role of Joey is played by host Jimmy Fallon, who cavorts around the stage, slapping his legs in an imitation of hoofbeats, neighing, and eventually robot dancing. Handspring Puppet Company artistic directors Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler appeared at the Long Beach TED Talk series in March 2011 to speak about their puppetry. In a highly popular segment, Jones and Kohler introduce the Handspring philosophy towards the 'life' of a puppet, before demonstrating their points with the help of the puppet Joey (performed by original National Theatre cast members Craig Leo and Tommy Luther and original West End cast member Mikey Brett). As Malone and Jackman observe: > As Joey tentatively enters the stage space, he is met with a spontaneous > ovation sparked by the immediacy of the live moment, in turn aided by the > fact that Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they > treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey‚Äôs creators invite > the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not > only for his lifelike movement, but also for the way he is activated by > those around him. As both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe > Joey‚Äôs ‚Äúnervousness,‚Äù and a planned moment when Joey ‚Äúnotices‚Äù the audience > elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and > nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler‚Äôs jacket pocket, as he > ‚Äúknows‚Äù there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to > demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is > kicked. The audience must believe he will not be kicked ‚Äì only a spiteful > puppeteer could activate such a trick ‚Äì but Jones‚Äôs conviction that he > should respect the animal‚Äôs space foregrounds the moment‚Äôs liveness and > heightens the audience‚Äôs engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and > Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider‚Äôs > weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly > exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits > the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound. Critical reception The Guardian's Michael Billington wrote in his review: > Elliott and Morris recreate the kaleidoscopic horror of war through bold > imagery, including the remorseless advance of a manually operated tank, and > through the line-drawings of Rae Smith projected on to a suspended screen. > Admittedly the performers are somewhat eclipsed by the action ... The joy of > the evening, however, lies in the skilled recreation of equine life and in > its unshaken belief that mankind is ennobled by its love of the > horse.Billington, Michael.\\"War Horse\\", The Guardian, 18 October 2007, > accessed 2 April 2011. Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph had written that, generally, \\"puppets are often an embarrassment, involving a lot of effort and fuss for negligible returns\\"; in this case, he praised the puppetry as \\"truly magnificent creations by the Handspring Puppet Company.\\"Spencer, Charles. \\"War Horse: Horse play is no puppet show\\", The Telegraph, 18 October 2007.

Not > surprisingly, Mr. Morpurgo's plot can't stand the strain. Dramatic > situations that work perfectly well in the context of the book play like > Hollywood clich√©s onstage. In the first act, the craftsmanship is so > exquisite that this doesn't matter‚Äîmuch‚Äîbut things go downhill fast after > intermission. The really big problem is the last scene, about which, once > again, the drama critics' code commands silence. This much must be said, > though: A play that is so forthright about the horrors of war owes its > audience a more honest ending.\\" Theatre review aggregator Curtain Critic gave the production a score of 88 out of 100 based on the opinions of 21 critics.

The South African government responded by sending troops back into Angola, intervening in the war from 1981 to 1987, prompting the Soviet Union to deliver massive amounts of military aid from 1981 to 1986. The USSR gave the Angolan government over US$2 billion in aid in 1984. In 1981, newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan's U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Chester Crocker, developed a linkage policy, tying Namibian independence to Cuban withdrawal and peace in Angola. South African attacks The South African military attacked insurgents in Cunene Province on May 12, 1980. The Angolan Ministry of Defense accused the South African government of wounding and killing civilians. Nine days later, the SADF attacked again, this time in Cuando- Cubango, and the MPLA threatened to respond militarily. The SADF launched a full-scale invasion of Angola through Cunene and Cuando-Cubango on June 7, destroying SWAPO's operational command headquarters on June 13, in what Prime Minister Botha described as a \\"shock attack\\". The Angolan government arrested 120 Angolans who were planning to set off explosives in Luanda, on June 24, foiling a plot purportedly orchestrated by the South African government. Three days later, the United Nations Security Council convened at the behest of Angola's ambassador to the UN, E. de Figuerido, and condemned South Africa's incursions into Angola. President Mobutu of Zaire also sided with the MPLA. The Angolan government recorded 529 instances in which South African forces violated Angola's territorial sovereignty between January and June 1980. Cuba increased its 35,000-strong troop force in Angola from 35,000 in 1982 to 40,000 in 1985. South African forces tried to capture Lubango, capital of Hu√≠la province, in Operation Askari in December 1983. Democratic International U.S.-supported UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. On June 2, 1985, American conservative activists held the Democratic International, a symbolic meeting of anti-Communist militants, at UNITA's headquarters in Jamba, Angola. Primarily funded by Rite Aid founder Lewis Lehrman and organized by anti- Communist activists Jack Abramoff and Jack Wheeler, participants included Savimbi, Adolfo Calero, leader of the Nicaraguan Contras, Pa Kao Her, Hmong Laotian rebel leader, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, South African security forces, Abdurrahim Wardak, Afghan Mujahideen leader, Jack Wheeler, American conservative policy advocate, and many others. While the Reagan administration, though unwilling to publicly support the meeting, privately expressed approval. The governments of Israel and South Africa supported the idea, but both respective countries were deemed inadvisable for hosting the conference. The participants released a communiqu√© stating, :\\"We, free peoples fighting for our national independence and human rights, assembled at Jamba, declare our solidarity with all freedom movements in the world and state our commitment to cooperate to liberate our nations from the Soviet Imperialists.\\" Clark Amendment The United States House of Representatives voted 236 to 185 to repeal the Clark Amendment on July 11, 1985. The Angolan government began attacking UNITA later that month from Luena towards Cazombo along the Benguela Railway, taking Cazombo on September 18. The government tried unsuccessfully to take UNITA's supply depot in Mavinga from Menongue. While the attack failed, very different interpretations of the attack emerged. UNITA claimed Portuguese-speaking Soviet officers led government troops while the government said UNITA relied on South African paratroopers to defeat the government. The South African government admitted to fighting in the area, but said its troops fought SWAPO militants. A war intensifies SWAPO's and South Africa's operations (1978‚Äì1980) By 1986, Angola began to assume a more central role in the Cold War, with both the Soviet Union, Cuba and other East bloc nations enhancing support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, non-democratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in the Cold War. The Soviet Union gave an additional $1 billion in aid to the Angolan government and Cuba sent an additional 2,000 troops to the 35,000 strong force in Angola to protect Chevron oil platforms in 1986. Savimbi had called Chevron's presence in Angola, already protected by Cuban troops, a \\"target\\" for UNITA in an interview with Foreign Policy magazine on January 31.Franklin (1997). Page 219. In Washington, Savimbi forged close relationships with influential conservatives, including Michael Johns (The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy analyst and a key Savimbi advocate), Grover Norquist (President of Americans for Tax Reform and a Savimbi economic advisor), and others, who played critical roles in elevating escalated U.S. covert aide to Savimbi's UNITA and visited with Savimbi in his Jamba, Angola headquarters to provide the Angolan rebel leader with military, political and other guidance in his war against the Angolan government. With enhanced U.S. support, the war quickly escalated, both in terms of the intensity of the conflict and also in its perception as a key conflict in the overall Cold War. The New York Times reported on February 1, 1987, that U.S. weapons shipments to UNITA were escalating considerably. \\"According to the sources,\\" The New York Times reported, \\"the light blue cargo planes of Santa Lucia Airways made arms deliveries on three occasions: between March 20 and April 20, for two weeks between May 15 and 30, and during one night in mid-October. Most of the landings were at night, but in May 'it was day and night -quite some activity,' one source said.\\"\\"CIA Said to Send Weapons Via Zaire to Angola Rebels,\\" The New York Times, February 1, 1987. In addition to escalating its military support for UNITA, the Reagan administration and its conservative allies also worked to expand recognition of Savimbi as a key U.S. ally in an important Cold War struggle. In January 1986, Reagan invited Savimbi to meet with him at the White House. Following the meeting, Reagan spoke of UNITA winning a victory that \\"electrifies the world\\" at the White House in January 1986. Two months later, Reagan announced the delivery of Stinger surface-to- air missiles as part of the $25 million in aid UNITA received from the U.S. government. Jeremias Chitunda, UNITA's representative to the U.S., became the Vice President of UNITA in August 1986 at the sixth party congress. Fidel Castro made Crocker's proposal, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Angola and Namibia, a prerequisite to Cuban withdrawal from Angola on September 10. UNITA forces attacked Camabatela in Cuanza Norte province on February 8, 1986. ANGOP alleged UNITA massacred civilians in Damba in U√≠ge Province later that month, on February 26. The South African government agreed to Crocker's terms in principle on March 8. Savimbi proposed a truce regarding the Benguela railway on March 26, saying MPLA trains could pass through as long as an international inspection group monitored trains to prevent their use for counter-insurgency activity. The government did not respond. In April 1987 Fidel Castro sent Cuba's Fiftieth Brigade to southern Angola, increasing the number of Cuban troops by twelve to fifteen thousand troops. The Angolan and American governments began negotiating in June 1987.Kalley (1999). Page 36. =Cuito Cuanavale and New York City= Cuando Cubango province UNITA and South African forces attacked the MPLA's base at Cuito Cuanavale in Cuando Cubango province from January 13 to March 23, [1988], in the second largest battle in the history of Africa,George (2005). Page 1. after the Battle of El Alamein, the largest in sub-Saharan Africa since World War II.Alao (1994). Pages 33‚Äì34. Cuito Cuanavale's importance came not from its size or its wealth but its location. The ensuing Battle of Cuito Cuanavale has since been disputed with both sides claiming victory. The Cuban government joined negotiations on January 28, 1988, and all three parties held a round of negotiations on March 9. The South African government joined negotiations on May 3 and the parties met in June and August in New York City and Geneva. All parties agreed to a ceasefire on August 8. Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the Tripartite Accord, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City, United States on December 22, 1988. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 626 later that day, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, a UN peacekeeping force. UNAVEM troops began arriving in Angola in January 1989. Ceasefire As the Angolan Civil War began to take on a diplomatic component, in addition to a military one, two key Savimbi allies, The Conservative Caucus' Howard Phillips and the Heritage Foundation's Michael Johns visited Savimbi in Angola, where they sought to persuade Savimbi to come to the United States in the spring of 1989 to help the Conservative Caucus, the Heritage Foundation and other conservatives in making the case for continued U.S. aid to UNITA. President Mobutu invited eighteen African leaders, Savimbi, and dos Santos to his palace in Gbadolite in June 1989 for negotiations. Savimbi and dos Santos met for the first time and agreed to the Gbadolite Declaration, a ceasefire, on June 22, paving the way for a future peace agreement. President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia said a few days after the declaration that Savimbi had agreed to leave Angola and go into exile, a claim Mobutu, Savimbi, and the U.S. government disputed. Dos Santos agreed with Kaunda's interpretation of the negotiations, saying Savimbi had agreed to temporarily leave the country. On August 23, dos Santos complained that the U.S. and South African governments continued to fund UNITA, warning such activity endangered the already fragile ceasefire. The next day Savimbi announced UNITA would no longer abide by the ceasefire, citing Kaunda's insistence that Savimbi leave the country and UNITA disband. The government responded to Savimbi's statement by moving troops from Cuito Cuanavale, under government control, to UNITA-occupied Mavinga. The ceasefire broke down with dos Santos and the U.S. government blaming each other for the resumption in armed conflict.Kalley (1999). Page 46.

Described variously as English and Scottish, Wright trained in Edinburgh under the Scots painter George Jamesone, and acquired a considerable reputation as an artist and scholar during a long sojourn in Rome. There he was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca, and was associated with some of the leading artists of his generation. He was engaged by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the governor of the Spanish Netherlands, to acquire artworks in Oliver Cromwell's England in 1655. He took up permanent residence in England from 1656, and served as court painter before and after the English Restoration. A convert to Roman Catholicism, he was a favourite of the restored Stuart court, a client of both Charles II and James II, and was a witness to many of the political maneuverings of the era. In the final years of the Stuart monarchy he returned to Rome as part of an embassy to Pope Innocent XI. Wright is currently rated as one of the leading indigenous British painters of his generation, largely for the distinctive realism in his portraiture. Perhaps due to the unusually cosmopolitan nature of his experience, he was favoured by patrons at the highest level of society in an age in which foreign artists were usually preferred. Wright's paintings of royalty and aristocracy are included amongst the collections of many leading galleries today. Early years and Scottish connections George Jamesone (1590‚Äì1644) self-portrait (c.1642), National Galleries of Scotland John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest. A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, (subscription required) in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.The baptismal record was discovered ‚Äì by Waterhouse: What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\".Waterhouse p.70 The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).Currently in Marquess of Ailesbury's private collection in Tottenham House It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. Rome and the Netherlands \\"The Virgin and Child\\" (1647) after Annibale Carracci. Wright's earliest known Scottish work, dedicated to the Marquess of Somerfield. Hunterian Collection There is evidence to suggest that Wright went to France following his apprenticeship, however his eventual destination was Italy. It is possible that he arrived in Rome as early as 1642 in the entourage of James Alban Gibbes (a scholar of English descent), but he was certainly resident there from 1647. Although details of his time there are sketchy, his skills and reputation increased so much so that by 1648 he had become a member of the prestigious Accademia di San Luca (where he is recorded as \\"Michele Rita, pittore inglese\\"). At that time, the Accademia included numbers of established Italian painters as well as illustrious foreigners including the French Nicolas Poussin and Spaniard Diego Vel√°zquez. On 10 February that year he was elected to the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon, a charitable body promoting the Roman Catholic faith through art, which hosted an annual exhibition in the Pantheon. Wright was to spend more than ten years in Rome. During that time became an accomplished linguist as well as an established art connoisseur. He also became prosperous enough to build up a substantial collection of books, prints, paintings, gems and medals, including works attributed to Mantegna, Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian and Correggio. He acquired some forty paintings ‚Äì perhaps as much through dealing as collecting. Richard Symonds, the amateur painter and royalist, catalogued Wright's collection in the early 1650s (and designated him as \\"Scotus\\"). =Antiquarian for Leopold of Austria= In 1654, after a decade in Rome, Wright travelled to Brussels where his abilities were recognised by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria then governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Leopold employed him not as an artist, but as an advisor on antiquities. As the younger brother of the Emperor Ferdinand III and cousin of Philip IV of Spain, the Archduke had the wherewithal to amass a large collection of paintings and antiquities. Moreover, in the spring of 1655, the Archduke was enjoying a period of cordial relations with Oliver Cromwell, then Lord Protector of England. (indeed, the two had been exchanging gifts of horses, and Leopold had provided Cromwell with choice tapestries and other artefacts for the refurbishment of the Palace of Whitehall. Cromwell also received an embassy from the Habsburgs congratulating him on his new office.) Archduke Leopold's Gallery in Brussels, for which Wright collected (painting by David Teniers the Younger c. 1650).Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his Gallery in Brussels Since the execution of Charles I in 1649, Leopold had been purchasing artworks from the royal collections and those of various aristocrats, and, against this background, commissioned Wright to travel to London and acquire further specimens. A passport was issued to him as \\"'Juan Miguel Rita, pintor Ingles, qua va a Inglaterra a procurar pinturas, medalas, antiguedades, y otras costa se√±aladas, que le hemosencargado...\\"Bodleian Library, Oxford University, Rawlinson MSS. Series A, Vol.26, fol.101. to allow him to travel to England. The passport is dated 22 May 1655, and signed by the Archduke at Brussels, indicating that Wright had left Italy for Flanders by this time. (The addition of the saint's name, John, probably marks his conversion to Roman Catholicism at some time prior.) As one on an official mission, Wright would probably have offered greetings to Leopold's ambassador extraordinary in London, the Marqu√©s de Lede, and to Alonso de C√°rdenas, the regular Habsburg ambassador, who had also been engaged since 1649 in art procurement for the Spanish Monarch. The lack of records means that the timing and duration of this visit remain uncertain. However, de Lede left in late June, and de C√°rdenas a few weeks later ‚Äì as relations between Cromwell and the Habsburgs deteriorated ‚Äì so Wright probably arrived back in Flanders, with any acquisitions he had made, just in time to learn of the Archduke's impending departure ‚Äì and that of his huge art collection ‚Äì from Brussels in the autumn of 1655. However, after the relocation of his patron to Vienna, Wright again visited London. On 9 April 1656 he passed through Dover, and the register of visitors indicates: Perhaps tactfully, the record glosses Wright's employment in Flanders, (euphemistically referred to as \\"other parts\\") as England and the Habsburgs were now at open war, and it fails to mention his membership of the Accademia di San Luca, which would have identified him as a Roman Catholic. England National Portrait Gallery Whatever his intentions, Wright did not return to Italy, rather he was joined in England by his family soon after. Despite his Roman Catholicism and the strong Protestantism of the Protectorate (1653‚Äì1659), Wright seems to have been able to find prestigious work. Indeed, Waterhouse speaks of him engaging in \\"the most deliberate and unblushing toadying to Cromwell\\" in his 1658 painting of a small posthumous portrait of Elizabeth Claypole, Oliver Cromwell's daughter (now in the National Portrait Gallery). This is an allegorical portrait depicting Elizabeth as Minerva, leaning on a carved relief representing the goddess springing from the head of Jove with the motto \\"Ab Jove Principium\\" ‚Äì an allusion to Cromwell himself, whose cameo portrait she holds. Seemingly, he was also willing to work the other side of the political divide: in 1659 he painted Colonel John Russell who was a player in the \\"Sealed Knot\\" conspiracy to restore Charles II to the throne. That particular portrait is regarded by at least one critic as Wright's \\"masterpiece\\". The portrait by Wright of King Charles II, in the Royal Collection After the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Wright's Roman Catholicism became less of a handicap, due to the King's preference for religious toleration. Never a good businessman, Wright encountered some financial difficulties and King Charles granted him the privilege of disposing of his collection of Old Masters by means of a lottery. The King himself acquired 14 of the paintings. By the early 1660s Wright had established a successful studio in London, and was described by diarist John Evelyn as \\"the famous painter Mr Write\\". Later, the Great Plague of London (1665) drove Wright out to countryside, where he painted at least three members of the Catholic family of Arundell of Wardour. Ironically, in the next year, the Great Fire of London (1666) was to be of benefit to him, when he received one of the City of London's first new artistic commissions to paint twenty-two full length portraits of the so-called 'Fire Judges' (those appointed to assess the property disputes arising from the fire). These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed. =Royal patronage= King Charles II Charles II, who promoted a number of Roman Catholics at court, granted Wright a measure of royal art patronage. In 1661, soon after the coronation, he painted a spectacular, formalised portrait of the monarch, seated in front of a tapestry representing the Judgement of Solomon, wearing St. Edward's Crown, the robes of the Garter, and carrying the orb and sceptre. Wright was also commissioned to paint an allegorical ceiling for the King's bedchamber at Whitehall Palace,Now in Nottingham Castle Museum and he was further appointed in 1673 to the office of \\"picture drawer in ordinary\\", allowing him to exercise his right to sign his pictures \\"Pictor Regis\\". However, to his disappointment, he did not receive the coveted office of King's Painter, which was held in the 1660s by Sir Peter Lely alone. In contrast to Wright's sympathetic realism, and carefully observed landscape backgrounds, Lely had a more glamorous style, favoured by the court, and based on Van Dyck's pre-Civil War style. This prompted the diarist Samuel Pepys to remark, after an enjoyable visit to Lely's studio, \\"thence to Wright's the painters: but Lord, the difference that is between their two works\\".Pepys, Diary entry for 18 June 1662, 3.113 Unlike Lely, who was knighted, Wright never received significant recognition from King Charles. However, at least one admirer thought he did deserve it. In 1669, Wright and the miniaturist Samuel Cooper had met Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Cosimo later called at Wright's studio where he commissioned a portrait of the Duke of Albemarle from Wright. On 3 March 1673, perhaps some time after Wright had painted his state picture of Charles II (now in the Royal Collection), a strange letter was sent from an obscure \\"Mairie Lady Hermistan\\" (evidently a fellow Roman Catholic) to Cosimo, asking him to intercede with the King to grant Wright a baronetcy. However, nothing came of the request. Sir Neil O'Neil (1680), Tate Collection Lord Mungo Murray (c.1683), Scottish National Portrait Gallery As antipathy towards Catholics intensified in London from the late 1670s, Wright spent more time working away from court. He painted six family portraits for Sir Walter Bagot of Blithfield in Staffordshire in 1676/7. In 1678, he removed to Dublin for a number of years, perhaps due to the anti-Catholic hysteria generated by Titus Oates's Popish Plot. Here, still styling himself \\"Pictor Regis\\", he painted \\"The Ladies Catherine and Charlotte Talbot\\", which is today in the National Gallery of Ireland. He also painted two full-lengths portraits of costumed chieftains, the \\"Sir Neil O'Neill\\" (c. 1680), now in the Tate Collection, and the \\"Lord Mungo Murray\\" (c.1683), now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Sir Neil O'Neill was a fellow Roman Catholic, also in exile in Dublin. Wright portrayed him in the dress costume of an Irish chieftain, with suit of rare Japanese armour at his feet. The significance of this armour is that it is thought to be a coded symbol of a triumph over the persecutors of Roman Catholicism, of whom, at that time, the Japanese were notorious. The portrait of Mungo Murray (the 5th son of the Royalist Marquis of Atholl) is notable for being considered one of the first instance of Scottish tartan being portrayed in art. =Roman embassy= In 1685, when the openly Roman Catholic James II ascended the throne, Wright was able to return to royal service. However, significantly, James did not employ Wright as an artist, but gave him the \\"time consuming and futile post\\" of steward on a diplomatic embassy. He was appointed as steward to Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine husband of Barbara Villiers, the late King's mistress. Wright's knowledge of Rome and of the Italian language may have played a part in this, as Castlemaine was dispatched, in 1686, on an embassy to Pope Innocent XI to demonstrate that England could become a player on the Roman Catholic side in impending European conflicts. Wright's role in the embassy was to oversee the production of elaborate coaches, costumes and decorations for the procession, which secured a papal audience in January 1687. He also arranged a stupendous banquet for a thousand guests in the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, complete with sugar sculptures and a large state portrait of James II. While in Rome, Wright published an illustrated Italian account of the embassy, dedicated to the Duchess of Modena and, on his return, an English version was published in October 1687, dedicated to her daughter Queen Mary. =Final years= Sir John Corbet of Adderley(c.1676), Yale Center for British Art Wright's career came to an end in 1688 with the expulsion of King James II during the Glorious Revolution. He seems to have accepted the inevitable end of his royal favour with the accession to the throne of the Protestant William of Orange. He lived on, in relative poverty, for a further six years until 1694. In March of that year, he made a will leaving his house in St Paul's parish to his niece Katherine Vaux. His collection of drawings, prints and books were left to his nephew, the painter Michael Wright; however a codicil to the will stated that the books were to be sold on behalf of his son Thomas, who was then abroad. The books were auctioned on 4 June and on 1 August 1694, John Michael Wright was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields.Waterhouse suggests that his burial in an Anglican churchyard may mean that his religious status had changed (Waterhouse p.73). Artistic legacy Much of the scholarly appreciation of Wright's work is fairly recent. In 1982, an exhibition of his work: ‚ÄòJohn Michael Wright ‚Äì The King‚Äôs Painter‚Äô ‚Äì in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery ‚Äì led to a renewed interest in his contributions, and the catalogue (edited by Sara Stevenson and Duncan Thomson) re-wrote and uncovered much of the known biographical details. New works continue to be discovered and previously known ones re-attributed to him. Wright is now viewed as amongst the most successful of seventeenth-century Britain's indigenous artists, and is rated alongside contemporaries such as Robert Walker and William Dobson. One modern exhibition catalogue described him as \\"the finest seventeenth century British-born painter\\". Certainly, he was one of the few who painted the elite aristocracy of his day, and was responsible for some of the most magnificent royal portraiture surviving. This achievement is particularly significant in an age where even British patrons had tended to favour foreign artists like Holbein and Van Dyck, and would continue to favour immigrants such as Lely and Kneller. Indeed, part of the reason for Wright's success is recognised as being his unusually cosmopolitan training: no prior British artist had so much exposure to European influence. During his Italian sojourn, and his participation in the Accademia di San Luca, not only had Wright collected works attributed to continental giants like Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, he had also been influenced by, and even copied, much of their tone and style. { - style=\\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\\" style=\\"width:300px; padding:10px;\\"NPG style=\\"width:300px; padding:10px;\\"Lely's Duchess of Cleveland (1666) as the penitent Magdalen } Portrait of a Lady, thought to be Ann Davis, Lady Lee (unknown date), private collection In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would \\"ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms\\" but that positively \\"they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality\\". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet- like figure. However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\".Pepys, Diary, entry for 21 August 1668 Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh ‚Äì even risky ‚Äì reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‚Äòdisguise‚Äô of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth.

He returned to the Netherlands in 1624 and spent some time in the garrison of Ostend, with the Franciscan priest Brian Mac Giolla Coinnigh as chaplain to his company He is believed to have spent his final years in penury in the Irish College of St Anthony in Leuven, where he died about 1632. Some years later, Mac Domhnail's son, S√©amas mac Somhairle Mac Donmhnaill, served as lieutenant to his kinsman, Alastair mac Colla Chiotaigh Mac Domhnaill (Alasdair Mac Colla), in Scotland (1644-45), and in Ireland afterwards, before serving in the Spanish army in the Netherlands.  Patron of the Arts  In the period spent in Ostend he commissioned the writing of two manuscripts, a collection of Fenian Lays, Duanaire Finn, and a collection of bardic poetry, The Book of O'Connor Donn. The collection of Lays in Duanaire Finn, written by the scribe and soldier Aodh √ì Dochartaigh in 1627, was published by Dr Eoin Mac N√©ill and Gerard Murphy in three volumes between 1908 and 1953. Both books were bequeathed by Mac Domhnail to the Irish College in Leuven. In literature Mac Domhnaill is depicted as an historical character in Darach √ì Scola√≠' novel An Cl√©ireach..

Arena history =Opening= In 1990, the rink opened as the Bladerunner ArenaA to Z of Hockey, Pl as part of the brand new Leisure Plaza complex, located close to Milton Keynes Central railway station. The Leisure Plaza facility offered a leisure and retail complex to Milton Keynes: the location featured trees, shrubbery, family picnic areas and a large pond hosting wildlife and plants with a footbridge crossing the water. In addition to the ice rink, the new complex also featured Flamingo's nightclub, Megabowl 10-pin bowling alley, Cafe Moonshine (later Heroes sports bar), an Argos superstore and Homebase centre. The ice rink itself boasted 2,200 seats, 3 licensed bars (one overlooking the ice surface, the other a kiosk at ice level), a restaurant, 3 function rooms (2 of which overlooked the ice surface ‚Äì one having a bar), an ice sports shop, cafeteria, video games area, skate hire, 8 team changing rooms (1 reserved for the home professional ice hockey team), DJ box, management offices and an olympic sized ice pad. Its facilities and ice pad was one of several rinks which opened in the 1980s and '90s. In the early '90s two of Bladerunner's smaller changing rooms were converted into a large changing room, office and meeting area for the specific use of the Milton Keynes Kings Junior Ice Hockey Club. =1990‚Äì96= Bladerunner would regularly sellout on Kings game nights and would often have to turn customers away due to the success of their public ice skating sessions. Other events included ice shows, figure skating competitions and concerts. On several occasions the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team used the arena for training camps and games and it was also used as the training base for Olympic champion figure skaters, Jane Torvill & Christopher Dean. In 1992 arena owners First Leisure closed the venue, however it was opened soon after following public outcry, including public rallies outside the offices of Milton Keynes Council and First Leisure. Public demand saw the ice rink re-open in time for the 1992/93 ice hockey season. However this was not the last time the ice rink would close its doors, a second short closing and re-opening in the early 1990s was followed by a permanent closure in 1996. =1996 closure= Public protest and the popularity of the Kings ice hockey team were not enough to find a new owner for the ice rink and the doors became locked, apparently for good, in the summer of 1996. Users of the ice rink instead were forced to travel over an hour to ice rinks in Oxford, Stevenage, Peterborough and Haringey ‚Äì including the MK Kings Junior Ice Hockey Club who re-located first to Stevenage and then to Haringey under the Milton Keynes name. =1998 re-opening= After two years of closure the arena re-opened under the new ownership in April 1998 and was renamed Planet Ice, with the Kings ice hockey team being re-formed in the third tier of English ice hockey under the ownership of local businessman Mike Darnell. Popularity of the venue was just as high as when the venue first opened in 1990, with Planet Ice's learn to skate courses being over-subscribed for several years. The arena featured several changes when it was re-opened, including; large scale re- decoration, the ice sports shop in the arena concourse being bricked up, the alcohol kiosk at bar level converted into a store room, a new 'Skate Xpress' shop opening in the skate hire area of the building. Not all areas of the ice rink complex re-opened, including the restaurant which remained closed. In addition to the MK Kings re-formation, Planet Ice reached an agreement with Anschutz Entertainment Group for their newly formed Superleague side London Knights to use the arena as their training base. This saw the junior club's purpose built changing room converted into a luxury dressing room with a two of the smaller changing rooms converted into an office and gym, all for exclusive use by the Knights. Delays in the opening of the Knights new arena in London saw the team play several home games in Milton Keynes before they were finally able to host games at the London Arena whilst the team trained and lived in MK. Planet Ice was sporadically converted into a basketball court and used as home venue for British Basketball League side Milton Keynes Lions for home games selected for live television coverage on Sky Sports. =2000‚Äì02= The Knights left Milton Keynes in the summer of 2000, moving to Lea Valley to be based closer to their home arena. The next year in 2001 saw the formation of a new senior ice hockey team, Milton Keynes Thunder to play at the fourth level of English ice hockey, key for local players not good enough to make the step up to the Kings team who had by now moved up to the second tier British National League. The arena in 2001 a second senior ice hockey team, Milton Keynes Thunder, began using the arena as their home venue, all be-it in the lower leagues of British ice hockey. A dispute over which league the Kings team should compete in led to Planet Ice evicting them from the arena in 2002,http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ICE+HOCKEY%3A+Milton+Keynes+Kings.-a086459816 with the new Milton Keynes Lightning formed in their place who joined the third tier English Premier League. =2002‚Äì2013= Thunder and Lightning have remained in the arena since, with Lighting achieving multiple league, playoffs and cup championships over their 10 seasons ‚Äì both teams have also moved up one league tier since their inceptions. ‚Äì although attendances at games have diminished since Wimbledon FC moved to Milton Keynes in 2003.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wimbledon/2209767.stm In 2012 the MK Lions basketball side explored the possibility of using Planet Ice as a permanent home following the closure of nearby Prestige Homes Arena, however no agreement was reached and the team re-located out of the city.http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/sport/basketball/mk-lions/exclusive-lions- to-leave-milton-keynes-after-15-years-1-4108816 Since the opening of the Xscape development in Central Milton Keynes, Leisure Plaza lost its prestige and had become rather neglected as the popularity of this once popular complex diminished. Flamingo's nightclub closed and was re-opened as 'Empire' but closed down again in the mid-2000s and has been shut since. Heroes sports bar also closed before re-opening as 'Smile Gentleman's Club'. A refurbishment had become overdue. =201314 refurbishment= Plans to refurbish the site, including upgrading the ice arena and the opening of apartments, retail units, a supermarket and casino, had been planned for some years; in March 2013 the redevelopment of the rink was confirmed as starting in summer 2013 with the permanent closure of the bowling alley. The ice rink closed on 14 July 2013 and redevelopment work started. The new rink opened in late 2014 in conjunction with a Morrisons Supermarket and another as yet unannounced shopping unit. =2017 = In April 2017, AEW UK bought the freehold interest in the arena building from Planet Ice. In June 2018, Strong Style Evolved UK, a two-day professional wrestling event promoted by New Japan Pro-Wrestling, took place at the Planet Ice Arena. In March 2020, the venue was temporarily transformed into a morgue to help deal with the casualties of the coronavirus pandemic.

He was the father of Charles (Carlino) Brown, a pioneer and politician of New Plymouth, New Zealand. Early life Brown was born in Lambeth (London). He had very little formal education and to a large extent was self- taught.McCormick, p. 2. He began a career as a merchant, starting as a clerk at the age of fourteen, earning ¬£40 per year. At eighteen he joined his brother in St. Petersburg, Russia in a fur-trading business where they were to accumulate the sum of ¬£20,000, only to lose most of it in an unwise speculation in bristles. They returned to England almost penniless,Stillinger, Letters, p. 2. though Brown capitalized on his Russian experience by writing a comic opera, Narensky, or, The Road to Yaroslaf, which was produced at Drury Lane in January 1814, earning him ¬£300 and free admission for life to this theatre.McCormick, p. 7. Friendship with John Keats Silhouette of Keats by Charles Brown (1819), given to Keats's sister Brown is best known for his close friendship with the poet John Keats. When Charles Brown first met Keats in the late summer of 1817, Keats was twenty-one, and Brown thirty.Stillinger, Letters, p. 1. Shortly after their meeting, Keats and Brown were planning to see Scotland together. Their famous tour was described in their letters and in ‚ÄúWalks in the North‚Äù. In 1818, after Keats's brother died of tuberculosis or consumption as it was called in his day, Keats moved into Brown‚Äôs half of Wentworth Place, taking the front parlour, where he lived for the next seventeen months. During this time Brown collaborated with Keats on a play, Otho the Great, which was not staged until the 1950s. Around 1890 Brown's son, Charles (Carlino) Brown said that Brown married Abigail O'Donohue in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Ireland in August 1819, after Brown had left Keats at Winchester. Most biographers do not appear to believe that the marriage took place and feel that Carlino's story was motivated by a desire to cover up his illegitimacy, due to the social stigma it would cause Carlino as a leading citizen of New Plymouth. Also there is evidence that Brown was in Chichester while Keats was in Winchester.McCormick, p. 227. After a severe haemorrhage in February 1820, Keats developed tuberculosis and Brown took care of him. This included handling all his affairs, paying his bills, writing his letters, even lending him money and standing as surety for a loan to him. Although Keats appeared to recover from the initial attack and the medical advice was that his lungs were sound, Keats's health fluctuated from that time on, gradually deteriorating. On medical advice that he could not survive the cold of another English winter, Keats travelled to Rome, Italy on 17 September 1820. Although Keats had wanted Brown to accompany him, Brown had not returned from a holiday in Scotland by the date of Keats's departure and so, on just over three-day's notice, the artist Joseph Severn agreed to accompany Keats.Brown, Joseph Severn: A Life, p. 62. Ironically (and unknown to them at the time), Brown's and Keats's ships were both moored at Gravesend on the same night as Brown returned to London and Keats departed to Italy. Brown remained at Wentworth Place in Hampstead, London during Keats's final illness, writing and receiving letters from both Keats and Severn. He shared some of the contents of those letters with Keats's fiancee Fanny Brawne, but did not disclose any information that he thought might upset her too much. Severn nursed Keats through his final illness until the poet's death in Rome on 23 February 1821. Move to Italy In July 1822, Charles Armitage Brown travelled to Italy with his son Carlino. It is not clear what became of Carlino's mother Abigail.John Keats: His Life and Poetry, His Friends, Critics and After-Fame, Chapter XVII \\"Epilogue\\", by Sydney Colvin, 1917, accessed 30 December 2009. Brown lived in Pisa from 1822 to around 1824, after which he moved to Florence. He published many articles in English periodicals, the best-known being \\"Shakespeare's Fools\\" in 1823. For many years he worked on his own autobiographical novel, Walter Hazlebourn, which he never finished. In Italy he moved in with Joseph Severn. His friend Leigh Hunt was there as well, and through him Brown was introduced to Lord Byron, John Taaffe, Jr. (friend of Byron and Shelley), Seymour Kirkup, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, Walter Savage Landor, and many others. In 1829, Edward John Trelawny, whom Brown had met in 1823 (just before Byron had sailed to Greece) came to live with him in Florence. For half the profits from its publication, Brown rewrote Trelawny‚Äôs Adventures of a Younger Son. Brown provided Trelawny with passages from Keats‚Äôs unpublished poems to be used (with others from Shelley and Byron) as chapter headings. Unfortunately this resulted in Trelawny being linked to Keats when he had actually never met him in person. On 6 June 1834 Brown suffered an apoplectic fit in Vieusseux‚Äôs Library, Palazzo Ferroni, Florence. Fortunately, a \\"surgeon with a lancet and bandage in his pocket\\" happened to be present and immediately administered a blood-letting (the normal treatment at that time) and he appeared to sustain no permanent damage from the incident.\\"Letter to Joseph Severn\\", from Charles Armitage Brown, 22 June 1834, last accessed 30 December 2009. However he died 8 years later from an apoplectic stroke. Return to England On 30 March 1835, Brown left Italy to return to England\\"Letter to Joseph Severn\\", from Charles Armitage Brown, 17 March 1835, accessed 30 December 2009. in order to provide a better education for his son Carlino, who was talented in mathematics and wished to pursue a career in civil engineering.\\"Letter to Joseph Severn\\", from Charles Armitage Brown, Plymouth, 31 May 1836, accessed 30 December 2009. He settled in Plymouth, Devonshire. Emigration to New Zealand In 1840, Brown became a shareholder in the newly formed Plymouth Company, which aimed to colonise New Plymouth, New Zealand. Shortly afterwards, his finances were ruined when he was forced to repay a friend's loan having agreed to be guarantor. With what little fortune remained to him, Brown decided that they should emigrate to New Plymouth as a pioneer community to provide the best opportunities for his son Charles as a civil engineer.Noble Friend of Famous Poet ‚Äî Further Facts about John Keats from Charles Brown's Letters. ‚Äî Relics Restored From New Zealand, The New Zealand Railways Magazine, Volume 12, Issue 1, 1 April 1937, accessed 30 December 2009 His son Charles emigrated on the Amelia Thompson, the first settler ship of the Plymouth Company arriving in 1841 aged 17 years old.\\"The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Taranaki, Hawke's Bay & Wellington Provincial Districts\\", accessed 30 December 2009. Brown followed on a second ship Oriental arriving three weeks later.\\"Charles Brown Goes Down In History\\" , Puke Ariki, 21 January 2005, accessed 4 December 2011. Before leaving for New Zealand, in 1841, he turned over copies of the unpublished poems of Keats to Richard Monckton Milnes. When Brown arrived in New Plymouth, his disappointment was profound. Unlike its namesake in England, this Plymouth was wilderness, with a treacherous coast instead of a harbour. He proposed an early return to England.ARC2005-327, Puke Ariki, accessed 6 December 2011. His last letters from New Plymouth, New Zealand, dated 22 and 23 January, were addressed to Joseph Severn and Trelawny. Death Charles Armitage Brown died from an apoplectic stroke on 5 June 1842 aged fifty-five at New Plymouth.Stillinger, Letters, p. 32; McCormick, p. 211. He was buried on the slope of Marsland Hill in New Plymouth above the original St Mary's Church; the grave was marked by a slab of stone taken from the beach. However, it was obscured when the top of the hill was flattened to allow for the construction of a barracks during the New Zealand Wars. The centenary of Keats's death aroused interest in finding Brown's grave and it was successfully relocated in March 1921 and marked by a stone inscribed, \\"Charles Armitage Brown. The friend of Keats.\\"\\"Local and General\\", Ashburton Guardian, Volume XLI, Issue 9473, 22 March 1921, p. 4, accessed 30 December 2009. The grave, surrounded by vegetation, was painted as a site of historical interest by Taranaki artist Thelma de Lancy-Green. On 2 April 2011 leading Keats scholar Professor Nicholas Roe from the University of St Andrews, Scotland laid a wreath on Brown's grave and discussed the friendship between the pair.Taranaki Daily News, 2 April 2011, accessed 4 December 2011. Professor Roe also visited Puke Ariki museum and library to explore the books that accompanied Charles Brown when he emigrated in 1841, including numerous editions of Romantic-period plays and an edition of Tasso known to have been among Keats's books at his death. This volume, which once belonged to Keats, also contains the bookplate and annotations of Charles Cowden Clarke, an author and Shakespearean scholar who taught Keats and encouraged his poetic leanings. Although the emigration to New Plymouth was not successful, Brown's wish that his son Carlino (known as Charles in New Zealand) would prosper there was fulfilled, as Charles went on to become a prominent businessman, military man and politician. The descendants of Charles Brown in New Zealand inherited items of John Keats memorabilia and many of these have been donated to the Keats House museum. Popular culture The 2009 film Bright Star, written and directed by Jane Campion, focuses on Keats's relationship with Fanny Brawne. In it, according to critic Ty Burr (The Boston Globe), Brown (played by actor Paul Schneider)\\"Bright Star (2009)\\", Internet Movie Database, accessed 30 December 2009. is presented as \\"the closest the movie comes to a villain, a cynical boor who knocks up his housemaid (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) and banishes Fanny so the boys can work on their plays and poems.\\"\\"'Bright Star' movie review\\", The Boston Globe, 25 September 2009, accessed 30 December 2009. Burr does however go on to emphasize that this portrayal of Brown's \\"love for Keats humanizes him... even if he loves the art more at first.\\" Abigail O'Donohue, Brown's housemaid in the film, becomes pregnant and has his child. Yet many film critics and the filmmaker herself have felt that Brown was imbued with many qualities, including loyalty and wit, and in reality there was no villain, just real life humans. A new online edition of Brown's letters to Joseph Severn reveals that he was a complex figure with a tremendous capacity for friendship and loyalty.New Letters, ed. Scott and Brown, Introduction.

It is made up of six communities: Oparanadim, Mpam, Ihitteafoukwu, Umuokirika, Obohia and Ekwereazu Town. Ihitteafoukwu has four villages, namely, Ogbor, Umueze, Umunomo and Umuchieze. Okirika-nwe-Eke is made up of Umuevu and Akpim which previously were part of Umuokirika. The central market called Eke Okwe gives the community its name. The community residents are mostly Roman Catholics with two big churches but Igbo traditional ceremonies like Iri Ji, Mgba and Ekpe are observed. The majority of the youth reside outside the town but maintain contact with their home town. The yearly reunion is evident during Christmas season when the village can barely contain its members returning from around the world. There is intermarriage within the community and this takes a tripartite form between Lomoma [Umuevu], Mpe na Ezeala [Umuevu] and Akpim. Intramarriage within each of the three communities is not permitted, considered a taboo, and has been so for over a century. Ekwereazu has a government-funded secondary school and two primary schools. Mpam is made of two parts namely: firstly Mpam Isieke consisting of Umuegwu, Nnemere and Umuaju and secondly Mpam Owere which comprises Umuohuo and Okponkume. The people are predominantly Catholic with a sprinkling of Anglicans, Pentecostal and a handful of atheists. They celebrate Iri ji Mbaise on the 15th of August every year and also celebrate the \\"Orururu Nnemere\\" festival which is an annual event every last week of the year precisely on the last Orie market day in the Igbo calendar. Most development is from self-help community efforts. The people and their leaders usually meet every eight days at the Eke Okwe market square to deliberate on matters affecting the community. The easiest route to the village is from Ogbe in Ahiara along the Owerri-Umuahia road which leads to the centre of the village. Other minor access roads are in from Agu na Eze, Oru na Lude, Nkwoala and Afo Ukwu around the village. The town shares boundaries with Ahiara, Ikeduru, and Obowo.

The fort has been demolished and the local government heritage-listed site repurposed as the Sydney Observatory.  History  Governor John Hunter ordered a fort to be built and Fort Phillip was commissioned in 1804 by the third New South Wales Governor (in office 1800‚Äì1806), Philip Gidley King, partly as a response to external threats such as a possible French attack in 1803 and partly due to the internal unrest from rebellious convicts reflected in Australia's only major convict rebellion at Castle Hill in March 1804. This was dubbed the Battle of Vinegar Hill as most of the convict rebels were Irish. Windmill Hill (later Observatory Hill) was chosen as a fort location as it was the highest point above the colony, affording commanding views of the Harbour approaches from east and west, the river and road to Parramatta, surrounding country and of the entire town below.[CC-By-SA] The fort was never fully completed and never fired a single shot in anger. A flagstaff was built in 1825 on the eastern wall of the fort, which sent messages to ships in the harbour and the signal station at Fort Denison and South Head. During 1847-48, a new signal station, designed by the colonial architect Mortimer Lewis, was built to replace the flagstaff. The fort was subsequently demolished leaving the eastern rampart as the only remaining evidence of the fort's existence. Sydney Observatory was built on the site in 1858 to provide accurate time readings for the colony and to observe stars in the southern sky.

He is classified as a surrealist. Life He was born in Magdeburg. As of 1914, Oelze attended the School of Decorative Arts in Magdeburg, where he was trained as a lithographer until 1918. He learned nude drawing in evening classes. Among his teachers there were Richard Winckel and Kurt Tuch, as of 1918. From 1919 until 1921, he completed his studies at the same school as a Stipendiat (a person receiving a scholarship). Between 1921 and 1925, he was a student at the Bauhaus, at first in Weimar with Johannes Itten, and then in Dessau, where he received a special teaching post at the Bauhaus. From 1926 until 1929, he lived in Dresden, and participated in an exhibition of the \\"Dredner Secession\\" there in 1929. He lived in Ascona in Switzerland from 1929 through 1930, and then in Berlin until 1932. After a longer residence on Lake Garda, he stayed in Paris in the years from 1932 to 1936 and became acquainted with Andr√© Breton, Salvador Dal√≠, Paul √âluard and Max Ernst. During this time he also met Mina Loy, whose posthumously published surrealist novel Insel depicts Oelze as the titular character. In 1936 his painting T√§gliche Sorge and a drawing were included in the exhibition Fantastic Art, Surrealism and Dada at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.Metken 1981, p. 513 During 1936‚Äì1937, he again lived in Switzerland and in Italy. In 1938, he moved to Germany, where he settled in the artists' colony in Worpswede in 1939. From 1941 through 1945, he performed military service and was taken prisoner. After the war, he again went to Worpswede, where he worked until 1962, and then moved to Gut Posteholz near Hameln. Oelze participated in documenta II in 1959 and in documenta III in 1964 in Kassel. In 1965, he became a member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. He died in Gut Posteholz on November 26, 1980. Work His most important work may well be Die Erwartung (The Expectation, 1935/1936), which depicts a group of people staring into an empty landscape with their backs to the observer. This picture is judged to be a fundamental picture in the history of painting. However, he had already had great success with exhibitions in Amsterdam, London, Paris and New York. Oelze was regarded as one of the most important painters of surrealism. His works are typified by a secretive representation of landscape and figural compositions, with rendition of details in the manner of the old masters. Oelze had an important influence on the later French surrealist, Christian d'Orgeix.  Honors  Oelze is the winner of the Max-Beckmann-Preis, received the Karl-Ernst- Osthaus-Preis of the city of Hagen, the Gro√üen Kunstpreis (Great Art Prize) of the state of North Rhine Westphalia, the Lichtwark-Preis of the city of Hamburg and was awarded the Niedersachsenpreis in the category of culture in 1980. The city of Magdeburg named a street for Oelze, the Oelzeweg, and there is a Richard-Oelze-Ring in Worpswede.

His finding that pathogens were present in expiratory droplets large enough to settle around an individual, the eponymous Fl√ºgge droplets, laid ground for the concept of droplet transmission as a route for the spread of respiratory infectious diseases. Early life and education Carl Fl√ºgge was a native of Hanover. He studied medicine in G√∂ttingen, Bonn, Leipzig and Munich, and in 1878 was a lecturer of hygiene in Berlin. Career In 1881 Fl√ºgge became the first chair of hygiene at the University of G√∂ttingen, and afterwards a professor at the Universities of Breslau and Berlin, where he succeeded Max Rubner at the Department of Hygiene. Fl√ºgge was a colleague of microbiologist Robert Koch, with whom he co-edited the journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten. Two of his better-known assistants at Breslau were Wolfgang Weichardt (1875‚Äì1943) and Walther Kruse (1864‚Äì1943). Legacy Fl√ºgge is known for advocating hygiene as an independent medical discipline, and is remembered for performing extensive research involving the transmission of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and cholera. In the 1890s, he demonstrated that even during \\"quiet speech\\", minute droplets, the Fl√ºgge droplets are sprayed into the air. This laid ground to the concept of droplet transmission, still in use in the 21 st century. The finding was instrumental in Jan Mikulicz-Radecki's advocacy of surgical gauze masks in 1897. Publications Among his publications are two important books on hygiene: * Lehrbuch der hygienischen Untersuchungsmethoden; (‚ÄúTextbook of hygienic investigation methods‚Äù). * Grundriss der Hygiene; (‚ÄúOutline of hygiene‚Äù, new edition 1902). Other works include: * Beitr√§ge zur Hygiene; (‚ÄúContributions to hygiene‚Äù, 1872). * Die Mikroorganismen: mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der √Ñtiologie der Infektionskrankheiten; (‚ÄúMicroorganisms‚Äù, third edition 1896).

It is a colorless liquid that is used as a solvent. It has a characteristic hydrocarbon odor. Its industrial applications increased dramatically in the 21st century.  Preparation  Industrial routes to 1-bromopropane involve free-radical additions to the corresponding alkenes. In this way, the anti-Markovnikov product is obtained.David Ioffe, Arieh Kampf \\"Bromine, Organic Compounds\\" in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 2002 by John Wiley & Sons. . A laboratory synthesis involves treating propanol with a mixture of hydrobromic and sulfuric acids: :CH3CH2CH2OH + HBr ‚Üí CH3CH2CH2Br + H2O Alternate synthetic routes include treating propanol with phosphorus tribromide. or via a Hunsdiecker reaction with butyric acid. Applications Like many other liquid halocarbons, 1-bromopropane finds use as a liquid or gaseous solvent. It is a solvent for adhesives in aerosol glues that glue foam cushions together. It is a solvent in asphalt production, in the aviation industry for maintenance, and in synthetic fiber production. It is a solvent for degreasing plastics, optics and on metal surfaces, to remove soldering residues from electronic circuit boards. Its increasing use in the 21st century resulted from the need for a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons and perchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene) as a dry cleaning solvent. Regulation In the EU, 1-bromopropane has been classified as reproductive toxicant per Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, which makes it a \\"substance of very high concern\\". Since 2007, it has been approved for use under the U.S. EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) as a suitable replacement for ozone depleting chemicals. The U.S. EPA announced that, based on a work plan developed under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, in 2013 it will begin a full risk assessment of 1-Bromopropane. The North Carolina Department of Labor‚Äôs Occupational Safety and Health Division issued a Hazard Alert in 6/2014, as it \\"is not regulated to protect workers, consumers or the environment\\". Safety In 2003, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) set the time-weighted average threshold limit value for an 8-hour exposure at 10 parts per million (ppm). In 2014, the ACGIH adopted a lower threshold limit value of 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration set the permissible exposure limit at 5 ppm in 2010. Though symptoms of overexposure can begin within 2 days of exposure, typically long-term exposure is more harmful. In 2008, the U.S. CDC recommended that use of 1-bromopropane as a replacement for perchloroethylene may require adjustment and modification of equipment, improved ventilation, and use of personal protective equipment. In 2013, a peer-review panel convened by the U.S. National Toxicology Program unanimously recommended that 1-bromopropane, be classified as reasonably anticipated human carcinogens. Extended occupational exposure to 1-bromopropane in higher concentrations than recommended has resulted in significant injury to workers in the United States. Its use as a solvent in aerosol glues used to glue foam cushions has been especially controversial. Reported symptoms of overexposure affect the nervous system and include confusion, slurred speech, dizziness, paresthesias, and difficulty walking, unusual fatigue and headaches, development of arthralgias, visual disturbances (difficulty focusing), and muscle twitching. Symptoms may persist over one year. Other symptoms include irritation of mucous membranes, eyes, upper respiratory tract, and skin, as well as transient loss of consciousness. Loss of feeling in the feet, an example of paresthesia, is colloquially called \\"dead foot\\" by workers who suffer from it. Of nationwide \\"more than 140 cushion workers nationwide, mostly from plants in Utah, Mississippi and North Carolina,[...] that had been exposed to dangerous levels of the chemical, many of them sickened and [are] unable to walk\\". One worker's long-term exposure resulting in neurological damage was covered in the NY Times. Air sampling for the level of 1-bromopropane and monitoring workers' urine for metabolites are both effective at measuring workers' exposure. Occupational exposure to 1-bromopropane typically occurs through breathing or skin contact; it is easily absorbed into the blood via the skin. Replacing 1-bromopropane with water or acetone-based adhesives is the preferred NIOSH option for controlling occupational exposure, but other options include engineering controls like isolation and ventilation, administrative controls, and PPE that includes respiratory and skin protection. 1-Bromopropane can penetrate most gloves, but not those made of polyvinyl alcohol or laminates. =Animal studies= Animal studies of 1-bromopropane have showed that it is a carcinogen in those models. Rodents exposed to 1-bromopropane developed lung, colon, and skin cancer at higher rates. Environmental impact Although 1-bromopropane is naturally produced, it is one of the very short-lived substances ozone depleting chemicals.

Starting with the Neolithic finds, the emphasis of the collection is of finds from Sumer, Babylonia and Assyria, as well as northern Syria and eastern Anatolia. Excavations in historically important cities like Uruk, Shuruppak, Assur, Hattusha, Tell el Amarna, Tell Halaf (Guzana), Sam'al, Toprakkale and Babylon built the foundation of the museum's collection. Further acquisitions came from Nimrud, Nineveh, Susa and Persepolis. The museum shows finds from the cultures of Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyria, the Hittites and the Aramaeans. These finds often found their way to Berlin via the German Oriental Society. In 1899, the Middle East Department at the royal museums was created. In 1929, they were provisionally accommodated in the Bode Museum and the Pergamon Museum, where they have been accessible to the public since 1930. During the Second World War, there were hardly any war-related losses. The mobile exhibits, which were taken as art spoliage to the Soviet Union, were returned to East Germany in 1958. The collection had already opened again as the Vorderasiatisches Museum in 1953. Notable pieces of the collection are the Ishtar Gate and Procession Way of Babylon, remainders of the ancient city of Babylon, parts of the Eanna temple and Karaindash's temple to Inanna in Uruk. The museum also has an important number of Southwest Asian stamp and cylinder seals, as well as cuneiform texts. It has more than 200 of the Amarna letters and the larger (\\"Meissner\\") fragment (VAT 4105) of the Sippar tablet from the Epic of Gilgamesh, which includes Siduri's advice, unlike later editions of the epic. At present (2019) Barbara Helwing is the director of the museum, following Markus Hilgert (2014-2018).Vorderasiatisches Museum Previous directors were Beate Salje, Walter Andrae, Gerhard Rudolf Meyer, Liane Jakob-Rost and Evelyn Klengel Brandt, among others.

Early history Engraving published in 1885 The parish was organized in 1771 and chartered by the New Hampshire legislature in 1794 as Union Church Parish. At that time local Episcopalians and Congregationalists were considering uniting to hire one minister to serve both groups, but this never happened. The next year the Rev. Daniel Barber, who had once been a Congregational minister, became Union's rector. His son, the Rev. Virgil Barber, also became an Episcopal priest, but left the church in 1816 to become a Jesuit priest and to later found St. Mary's Parish in Claremont, the first Roman Catholic church in New Hampshire.CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: New Hampshire When the church was built, it did not originally have a tower, and was a relatively modest structure despite its massive roof framing timbers. The tower was added in 1801, and the building was lengthened by some in 1820, at which time a pulpit and reading desk were added. These interior additions were removed in 1850 and replaced by the present altar configuration. The property also includes a relatively rare set of period horse sheds.

These terminals have a wide variety of designs, sizes, and features that are often not well documented. Automotive battery terminals Automotive batteries typically have one of three types of terminals. In recent years, the most common design was the SAE Post, consisting of two lead posts in the shape of truncated cones, positioned on the top of the battery, with slightly different diameters to ensure correct electrical polarity. The \\"JIS\\" type is similar to the SAE but smaller, once again positive is larger than negative but both are smaller than their SAE counterparts. Most older Japanese cars were fitted with JIS terminals. General Motors, and other automobile manufacturers, have also begun using side-post battery terminals, which consist of two recessed female 3/8\\" threads (SAE 3/8-16) into which bolts or various battery terminal adapters are to be attached. These side posts are of the same size and do not prevent incorrect polarity connections. L terminals consist of an L-shaped post with a bolt hole through the vertical side. These are used on some European cars, motorcycles, lawn and garden devices, snowmobiles, and other light duty vehicles. Some batteries sizes are available with terminals in many different configurations, but two main configurations are: # positive on left and negative on right corner # negative on left and positive on right corner. Terminals can also be both on the long or short side of the battery, or diagonally opposed, or in the middle. Purchasing the wrong configuration may prevent battery cables from reaching the battery terminals. Marine battery terminals Marine batteries typically have two posts, a 3/8\\"-16 threaded post for the positive terminal, and a 5/16\\"-18 threaded post for the negative terminal.  Zinc battery terminals  Zinc battery terminals are an environmentally friendly alternative to lead battery terminals. These types of battery terminals were designed as a result of environmental directives such as Proposition 65 and RoHS. Zinc battery terminals offer advantages over lead alloy type battery terminals. These advantages include increased electrical conductivity, increased corrosion resistance, and reduced lead removal costs. SLA battery terminals The most common sizes of sealed lead acid (SLA) batteries use Faston tabs, but some larger batteries use L terminals, while some very specialized designs use other, sometimes proprietary terminals, such as older Panasonic camcorder batteries (of the type used for VHS shoulder-mounted camcorders). UPS battery terminals Batteries designed for use inside a portable uninterruptable power supply (UPS) typically use Faston tabs, often with an adapter cable between those and the UPS's internal battery connectors. Larger external battery packs use a variety of connectors, including the Anderson Powerpole MultiPole series (as used by Tripp Lite), which are color- coded and keyed for specific voltages. Very large batteries as installed in battery rooms such as are found in datacenters use bolted connections from cell terminals to bus bars or flexible cables. Dry battery terminals Most cylindrical dry batteries (such as the AA battery) have a projection at one end (positive) and a flat base (negative). These mate with metal strips or springs in the battery holder. Six volt lantern batteries typically feature two coiled, cone-shaped spring terminals, designed to mate with flat contact plates on the inside of the battery compartment. Some lantern batteries instead feature screw terminals, while still others instead feature pin holes. Nine-volt batteries have snap-on connectors. Button cell (watch batteries) have terminals as both flat sides.

The Cearbhall √ìg who composed 'Eilean√≥ir a R√∫n' was from Pallas, near Gorey in County Wexford. The Eilean√≥ir of the poem was the daughter of Sir Morgan Kavanagh of Poll an Mh√≥intigh in County Wexford. In folklore, Cearbhall is presented as a womaniser and trickster similar to the Gob√°n Saor.Doan 1982 pp.57, 83  Eilean√≥ir a R√∫n  Irish folklore recounts how Eilean√≥ir Chaomh√°nach (Eleanor Kavanagh) eloped with Cearbhall (Carroll) the day she was about to marry another man. Cearbhall arrived at the wedding to play music at the wedding feast, and fell in love with the bride. He composed the song Eileanoir a R√∫n to woo the bride.  Other Songs and Poems  Another song, in the style of the cros√°ntacht, Seachr√°n Chearbhaill, is ascribed to Cearbhall √ìg.

It was described by Mr. Pern in 1802, > the goal battery on the northern point of Sydney Cove is built on a rock of > difficult access, carrying six pieces of cannon protected by a trench of > turf, crosses the fire by another battery. Lieutenant William Kent and crew were assigned to man the battery which purportedly consisted of guns taken from . In 1817 Governor Lachlan Macquarie directed that a new fort be built on the site at Bennelong Point and this was completed in February 1821. In 1901 the New South Wales Minister of Works decided to remove Fort Macquarie. A naval drill shed on the site was also pulled down and both buildings were replaced with the Fort Macquarie Tram Depot whose crenulated walls imitated the original towers and walls of the fort. Design Designed by Francis Greenway the foundation stone of Fort Macquarie was laid by Governor Lachlan Macquarie on 17 December 1817. The stone used was from the nearby Governor's Domain quarry and convicts worked on it for around two years before it was complete. Its square design meant three of its faces were open to the sea to ensure a clear line of fire for its cannons. At the centre stood a two-story tower, 27.4 metres in circumference which housed a guardroom and storehouse. The walls at the top were around one and a half metres thick. A powder magazine capable of storing 350 barrels of gunpowder was constructed underneath and the tower could provide accommodation for a small military detachment of 1 officer and 18 men, with stores for the battery. The battery consisted of fifteen pieces of ordnance: ten 24-pounders and five 6-pounders. The powder magazine capable of storing 350 barrels of gunpowder was constructed underneath the tower which also provided accommodation for a small military detachment of one officer and 18 men, with stores for the battery. In the early years the fort was separated from the main spit of land by a narrow passage of salt water crossed by a drawbridge, this was later filled up to make a roadway. Cannon disposal Two 42 pdr ML cannon from Fort Macquarie were removed from the fort and transported to Newcastle in 1903 to form a memorial in Gregson Park, Hamilton. In 2006 they underwent a refurbishment and have been replaced back into Gregson Park.

It took place on the island of Noemfoor, in Dutch New Guinea (now Papua, in Indonesia), between 2 July and 31 August 1944. During the battle, Allied forces landed on the island to capture Japanese bases as part of their advance through the Pacific towards the Philippines. The initial landing was largely unopposed and the Japanese defenders withdrew inland as the US troops came ashore. Sporadic fighting took place over the course of two months as the Allies secured the three airfields on the island and pushed the surviving Japanese troops to the southeastern coast. The island was later used by the Allies to support operations around Sansapor and on Morotai. Background =Geography and strategic situation= Noemfoor is an elliptical, almost circular shape. It is approximately in diameter and encircled by coral reefs. The landscape is dominated by limestone and coral terraces, topped by a tall hill, which is covered by tropical rainforest, like much of the interior. One of the Schouten Islands, Noemfoor lies at the western end of the Japen Strait, to the north of Cenderawasih Bay (Geelvink Bay), between the island of Biak and the east coast of the Doberai Peninsula (Vogelkop/Bird's Head Peninsula), on mainland New Guinea. Map showing Japanese dispositions and the Allied assault plan The island was occupied by Japanese forces in December 1943. The indigenous civilian population numbered about 5,000 people, most of whom lived a subsistence lifestyle in coastal villages. There were also 1,100 laborers on the island: a 600-strong Formosan (Taiwanese) auxiliary labor unit and 500 Indonesian civilian forced laborers. According to the official U.S. Army history, over 3,000 Indonesian men, women, and children were shipped to Noemfoor by the Japanese military. Most came from Soerabaja (Surabaya) and other large cities on Java. These Javanese civilians were forced to construct roads and airfields, mostly by hand. Little food, clothing, shelter or medical attention were provided. Many attempted to steal Japanese supplies, and were executed. Others died from starvation and preventable disease. Survivors also alleged that sick Javanese were buried alive. The Formosan labor troops had originally numbered about 900 men. They had also worked on airfield and road construction, on half the ration of rice issued to regular Japanese troops. When they became ill from exhaustion, hunger, or tropical diseases, they were put in a convalescent camp. In the words of the U.S. official history: \\"There, their rations were again cut in half, and the shelter and blankets provided covered but a fraction of the inmates. Medical care was given only to the worse cases, and then was inadequate.\\" Throughout 1943‚Äì1944, the Japanese built three airfields on the island, turning it into a significant air base. The three fields were: Kornasoren Airfield/Yebrurro Airfield, located toward the northern end of the island; Kamiri Airfield, on the northwestern edge of the island; and Namber Airfield, on the west coast of the island. Of these, Kornasoren was unfinished at the time of the battle. Noemfoor was also used as a staging area for Japanese troops moving to reinforce Biak, which was invaded by the Allies in May 1944 as part of their westward advance along the northern New Guinea coast. Japanese barges could travel from Manokwari to Noemfoor‚Äîabout ‚Äîduring one night. =Allied plans= By 20 June, Japanese forces on Biak had been largely defeated and construction work began on the Mokmer airfield, which was operational two days later. Bombing of the Noemfoor by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began as early as April 1944. Between 20 June and 1 July, Allied bombers dropped 800 tons of bombs on the island. In describing his preparations for the Western New Guinea campaign, General Douglas MacArthur wrote in his memoirs that: \\"[t]he Hollandia Invasion initiated a marked change in the tempo of my advance westward. Subsequent assaults against Wakde, Biak, Noemfoor, and Sansapor were mounted in quick succession, and, in contrast to previous campaigns, I planned no attempt to complete all phases of one operation before moving on to the next objective.\\" At the time of the battle, the area's strategic importance lay it is proximity along planned Allied avenues of advance through the southwest Pacific and western New Guinea toward the Philippines. Specifically, Noemfoor was selected for invasion for four reasons: *Allied commanders believed that Japanese troops equivalent to less than one battalion would be based there; *the Allies were already experiencing a shortage of amphibious vessels and Noemfoor could be seized without large- scale operations; *it also had the greatest number of useful airfields in the smallest area and; *Japanese air defenses in western New Guinea were almost negligible. At the end of June, RAAF HQ reported that although the Namber and Kamiri airfields were serviceable, they were barely being used and \\"a possibly generous\\" estimate suggested that only 19 Japanese bombers and 37 fighters remained in New Guinea. Opposing forces MacArthur selected the 158th Regimental Combat Team to assault the island in Operation Cyclone commencing on 2 July. This formation consisted primarily of units from the Arizona National Guard, United States Army, and was commanded by Major General Edwin D. Patrick. The 158th formed part of General Walter Krueger's Sixth Army (Alamo Force). At the time of their assignment to the operation, the 158th was engaged in fighting around Wakde. To free them up for the assault, in mid- June, Kruger decided to replace 158th at Wakde with the US 6th Infantry Division. In mid-June, No. 10 Operational Group RAAF, under Air Commodore Frederick Scherger, was designated the controlling Allied air force unit for Operation Cyclone. The USAAF units attached to 10 OG for the invasion comprised: the 58th and 348th Fighter Groups and the 307th, 309th and 417th Bombardment Groups. Total personnel assigned to the task force numbered 10,000, including those from air units; the majority of these personnel, some 5,500, were service troops. Around 3,000 of these were assigned to undertake airfield construction tasks following the capture of the island. The ground invasion force ‚Äì composed primarily of the 158th RCT ‚Äì was primarily American and was known as Cyclone Task Force. It was augmented by the Australian No. 62 Wing RAAF, which was tasked with airfield improvement works, and a 39-strong contingent of Dutch civil administration personnel that was included to re- establish Dutch civil administration. This force was later reinforced by 10 local police officers after the landing. Facing them were approximately 2,000 Japanese troops, mostly from the 219th Infantry Regiment (35th Division) as well as some from the 222nd Infantry Regiment, who had been in transit to Biak. The garrison was commanded by Colonel Suesada Shimizu, who was also the commander of the 219th Infantry Regiment. Shimizu had arrived on the island on 8 June and had organized his defending troops into fourteen strongpoints; ultimately these were too widely dispersed to enable a coherent defense. Other units assigned to the Japanese garrison included the 8th Independent Battalion (Provisional), several airfield construction units, a motor transport company, an antiaircraft unit and elements of an airfield company and airfield battalion. Throughout 1944, various kinds of Japanese aircraft were at the Noemfoor airfields. Elements of 61¬∞ Hiko Sentai (\\"No. 61 Air Group\\"/\\"61st Flying Regiment\\"), flying Mitsubishi Ki-21 (\\"Sally\\") bombers, were based at Kamiri. However, Japanese aircraft played no significant role in the ensuing battle as the 23rd Air Flotilla was redeployed to resist US forces around Saipan on 13 June. Invasion The landing force mounted at Finschhafen and Toem, in late June, and sailed to the objective in three groups after orders had been drawn up and rehearsals had been undertaken. From 04:30 on 2 July, warships from the U.S.-Australian Task Forces 74 and 75‚Äîunder Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey‚Äîbombarded Japanese positions on Noemfoor. TF 74 was commanded for the first time by Commodore John Collins, making him the first graduate of the Royal Australian Naval College to command a naval squadron in action. In response to the bombardment, Japanese antiaircraft guns briefly fired upon spotting aircraft until being knocked out by naval gunfire from Allied ships. At 08:00 on 2 July, the 158th RCT was taken to the beach by TF 77, made up of LCMs and LCTs under Rear Admiral William Fechteler. The initial landings were near Kamiri airfield, on the northwest edge of the island. The island was surrounded by \\"an almost solid ring\\" of coral, but this did not hinder the landing and American newspapers later reported \\"almost no loss\\" of troops before reaching the shore. Shimzu's force had largely retired inland before the US landing. The initial landing was carried by two battalions, which land abreast of each other, securing a beachhead about half a mile wide, supported by LVTs crewed by personnel from the 3rd Engineer Special Brigade. U.S. Army M4 Sherman tanks and other vehicles disembarking from LSTs onto Noemfoor There had been extensive Japanese defensive preparations in the Kamiri area including wire entanglements, trenches, dugouts and prepared positions covering the Allied avenues of advance, but there was little resistance at Kamiri Airfield and the area was quickly secured as the assaulting infantry cleared the area. About 300 improvised land mines had been placed by the Japanese around the beach, but these were clearly marked and were dealt with quickly. A group of about 40 Japanese were killed around some of the caves in the area, but the majority of Japanese troops had withdrawn inland, as part of Shimzu's plan to move east towards Broe Bay to wait for evacuation; as a consequence the only opposition to the landing was an hour- long artillery bombardment from an inland battery, which fell on the landing beach and reef. One Allied soldier was killed in the bombardment, and two vehicles were destroyed before the battery was suppressed by naval guns. In the words of the U.S. Navy official history: \\"Japanese encountered around the airfield were so stunned from the effects of the bombardment that all the fight was taken out of them.\\" Kamiri was captured within hours of the landing. Reports indicated that approximately 45 Japanese soldiers were killed, and about 30 Japanese planes captured, although all of these were damaged as a result of the earlier bombardment and bombing. By 1750 hours on the first day, 7,100 troops had been landed, along with 500 vehicles and 2,250 tons of supplies, which had been unloaded from the eight assigned LSTs. The following day, 3 July, as a precaution against Japanese resistance elsewhere, the 2,000 paratroopers of the U.S. 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment began dropping onto the island. The regiment's 1st Battalion arrived first, suffering 72 non battle casualties as several sticks were dropped from low altitude, resulting in a large number of leg fractures. The 3rd Battalion followed the next day, incurring another 56 non battle casualties in the drop. As a result of the large numbers of injuries, the 2nd Battalion was brought ashore in LCIs instead of being dropped by air. The second base captured by US forces, Yebrurro airstrip, was secured by 4 July and the Allied beachhead was expanded towards Kamiri. That same day, the first elements of No. 10 Operational Group arrived on Noemfoor. There were no Japanese air attacks until the night of 4 July, when a light bomber dropped three bombs near Kamiri, without effect. A few days later, four single-engined fighters dropped about 40 incendiary bombs, causing some damage to Allied materiel. Early on 5 July, there was an unsuccessful counter-attack by Japanese ground forces at Kamiri, around Hill 201, although it was defeated by 0630 hours. Around 200 Japanese were killed during the assault, which was carried out by two companies from the 219th Infantry Regiment and around 150 Formosan laborers. For the remainder of the day, US forces carried out mopping up operations and sent out patrols towards the northeast. The following day, a detachment of U.S. forces from Noemfoor also secured the smaller neighboring island of Manim. The 2nd Battalion, 158th Infantry Regiment embarked upon 20 LCTs and sailed down the western coast to capture Namber Airfield which came under Allied control, without resistance, on 6 July. The island was officially declared secure on 7 July. However, individual Japanese soldiers continued guerrilla activities, albeit largely limited to night time raids. While this was taking place, the Dutch detachment were able to establish contact with local chiefs who assisted in mopping up operations against the Japanese from late July. Following this, as the Japanese withdraw further inland. Despite Shimzu's plans to withdraw to Broe Bay to await for evacuation, the majority of his troops melted into the hills and the evacuation never eventuated. Small groups attempted to resist and Shimzu's small force was slowly pushed towards the southeastern part of the island. Troops from the 503rd Parachute Infantry dispatched many patrols to pursue the withdrawing Japanese. Initially, a force of about 400‚Äì500 Japanese troops under Shimzu broke contact and gathered at Hill 670, several miles to the northeast of the airfield. The 1st Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment reestablished contact on 13 July and over the course of three days pushed towards the crest of the hill, which was found abandoned on 16 July. After withdrawing from Hill 670, Shimzu's force then managed to evade the US patrols until 23 July. About northwest of Inasi, troops from the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment clashed with the Japanese near the lagoon. For his actions during this engagement, Sergeant Ray E. Eubanks was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Contact between the two forces was lost from 25 July until 10 August, when a week long action took place around Hill 380. Despite US artillery and air strikes, the Japanese commander managed to slip through the US cordon with a small force and withdrew towards Pakriki, on the coast. Sporadic fighting continued throughout the rest of the month, but by 31 August all fighting had ceased. Aftermath =Casualties= Australian airfield construction personnel at Noemfoor By 31 August, Cyclone Task Force had lost 66 killed or missing and 343 wounded. It had killed approximately 1,730 Japanese and taken 186 prisoners. According to the U.S. Army official history, only 403 of the original 3,000 Javanese civilian laborers were alive by 31 August. About 10‚Äì15 were reported to have been killed accidentally by Allied forces. The rest had died from mistreatment before the invasion. About 300 Formosan labor troops had died before the invasion. Others fought the Allies, allegedly as a result of Japanese coercion. Over 550 surrendered; more than half of these were suffering from starvation and tropical diseases. Less than 20 were reported killed by Allied action. According to the U.S. Army historian, Robert Ross Smith, Allied personnel found evidence that human bodies, of Japanese, Formosan and Allied personnel, had been partly eaten by starving Japanese and Formosans. =Base development= Allied airfield repair and construction work by the RAAF and U.S. Army Engineers began on 2 July. On the afternoon of 6 July, before the formal cessation of hostilities on the ground, an RAAF P-40 fighter squadron had landed at Kamiri, supporting operations on Noemfoor and becoming the first of many Allied air force units to be based there. Namber Airfield was assessed as too rough and badly graded to be effectively used by Allied aircraft. It was abandoned in favor of expansion and improvements at Kornasoren. On 25 July, a USAAF P-38 Lighting fighter group was able to land there. By 2 September, two parallel runways had been completed; soon afterwards, B-24 Liberator heavy bombers began operating from Kornasoren Airfield, against Japanese petroleum facilities at Balikpapan, Borneo. Allied aircraft based on Noemfoor played an important role in the battles of Sansapor and Morotai.

The story concerns experiments in genetic engineering being done by a young scientific couple, who attempt to introduce human DNA into their work of splicing animal genes. Guillermo del Toro, Don Murphy, and Joel Silver are the executive producers of this film. Theatrically released on June 4, 2010, the film received generally positive reviews from critics but grossed just $27 million against a $30 million production budget. Plot Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, Clive‚Äôs brother Gavin discovers them. Dren jumps on him, and he flees, but Elsa notices that Dren has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, intending to kill her, but instead discovers that Dren is amphibious, leaving Elsa in doubt as to his intentions. Elsa forms a motherly bond with Dren. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren. After the presentation, they move Dren to an isolated farm where Elsa grew up. There, Dren displays carnivorous tendencies and retractable wings. She grows into adolescence and becomes bored with being locked up in the barn, but Elsa and Clive fear that letting her outside might lead to her discovery. Clive realizes that the human DNA used to create Dren was Elsa's, not from an anonymous donor as Elsa had told him. After Dren exhibits dangerous misbehavior, Elsa restrains Dren and removes her stinger, using it to synthesize the protein that Elsa and Clive had been searching for. Meanwhile, Dren overwhelms Clive with pheromones and she rapes him in the barn, horrifying Elsa. After freeing himself, Clive accuses Elsa of never having wanted a \\"normal\\" child because of her fear of losing control; instead she chose to raise one as an experiment, where control could be assured. Deciding that the only solution is to terminate Dren, they return to the farm and find Dren seemingly already dying. William Barlow discovers human DNA in Dren's protein samples and arrives to investigate. Elsa tells Barlow that Dren is dead and buried behind the barn. However, Dren, having metamorphosed into a male, rises from the grave and attacks the group, killing Barlow and Gavin before raping Elsa. Clive attacks Dren to save Elsa, but Dren overpowers him. Elsa intervenes and is about to kill Dren, but she hesitates, which allows Dren to kill Clive. Angered, Elsa then mercilessly kills Dren with a rock, before breaking down after Clive was dead. Elsa is later informed that Dren's body contained numerous biochemical compounds for which the company began filing patents. Joan offers Elsa, who is traumatized by her ordeals and now visibly pregnant with Dren's baby, a large sum of money to go through with the pregnancy, which Elsa accepts. Cast * Adrien Brody as Clive Nicoli * Sarah Polley as Elsa Kast * Delphine Chan√©ac as Dren * Brandon McGibbon as Gavin Nicoli * Simona Maicanescu as Joan Chorot * David Hewlett as William Barlow * Abigail Chu as Child Dren Production Splice was written by director Vincenzo Natali and screenwriters Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor. The script was originally meant to follow up Natali's Cube (1997), but the budget and restricted technology hindered the project. In 2007, the project entered active development as a 75% Canadian and 25% French co-production, receiving a budget of $26 million. The director described the film: \\"Splice is very much about our genetic future and the way science is catching up with much of the fiction out there. [This] is a serious film and an emotional one. And there's sex... Very, very unconventional sex. The centerpiece of the movie is a creature which goes through a dramatic evolutionary process. The goal is to create something shocking but also very subtle and completely believable.\\" In October 2007, actors Brody and Polley were cast into the lead roles. Production began the following November in Toronto. It was aided by Telefilm Canada's funding of US$2.5 million. Filming took place in Toronto and concluded in February 2008. In an interview, when asked if there would be any sequels, Natali responded, \\"I don't think so. It could happen, but it would have required the movie to make a lot of money in the States, but even though the ending of the film appears to be setting up a sequel, that was never my intention. All of my films end with a question, and somewhat ambiguously, and they always imply the beginning of another story. I like to leave the audience with something to ponder.\\" Release The film premiered on October 6, 2009 at the Sitges Film Festival, where it won \\"Best Special Effects\\" and was in the running for \\"Best Film\\", and was part of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. After a bidding war with Apparition, The Weinstein Company, Newmarket Films, First Look Studios, Samuel Goldwyn Films, and Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions, Dark Castle Entertainment purchased the U.S rights to the film and the worldwide rights to any possible sequels in February 2010, thinking they \\"found the next Paranormal Activity\\". The film received a wide release in the United States on June 4, 2010, with Warner Bros. as distributor. The trailer was attached to two other Warner Bros. movies, The Losers and A Nightmare on Elm Street. The film opened on June 4, 2010 in wide release to a $7.4 million opening weekend in 2,450 theaters, averaging $3,014 per theater. Splice was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 5, 2010, in the US and on November 29, 2010, in the UK. Reception Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 184 reviews; the average score is 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"It doesn't take its terrific premise quite as far as it should, but Splice is a smart, well-acted treat for horror fans.\\" Review aggregator Metacritic gave the film an average score of 66 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Natali \\"hasn't reinvented the horror genre\\" but \\"has done the next best thing with an intelligent movie that, in between its small boos and an occasional hair-raising jolt, explores chewy issues like bioethics, abortion, corporate-sponsored science, commitment problems between lovers and even Freudian-worthy family dynamics.\\" Andrew O'Hehir from Salon said \\"Dark, sleek, funny and creepily infectious, the genetic-engineering horror-comedy Splice is a dynamic comeback vehicle for Canadian genre director Vincenzo Natali, who made a splash a few years ago with Cube.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A‚àí and stated, \\"The outstanding creature effects by Howard Berger only get more astonishing as Splice splits into an eerie horror picture, then divides again into something out of Rosemary's Baby.\\" Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times called it \\"well done and intriguing\\" but said it is disappointing in that it does not explore Dren's persona. Comparing the film to David Cronenberg's The Brood, Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, \\"Played as a child by Abigail Chu and as an adult by Delphine Chan√©ac, Dren morphs into a special-effects miracle, sexy and scary in equal doses.\\" and gave the film 3 out of 4. Also comparing the sex scenes to Cronenberg's work, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle rated it 2/4 stars and wrote that while it has several disgusting scenes, it is \\"a regulation monster movie\\" that is \\"too dumb to be serious and too slow to be entertaining\\". Richard Roeper panned Splice, calling it one of the worst movies of 2010. He gave the film a D+, calling it \\"ridiculous\\" but giving it credit for trying to be different. =Accolades= Splice won the 2011 Telefilm Golden Box Office Award, CAD$40,000, for being the highest-grossing Canadian feature film in English in 2010. The film was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at 37th Saturn Awards, but lost to Inception, another film from Warner Bros.

Plot Late at night, brothers Will and Roger arrive at a closed factory in search of their missing father, who is undertaking secret experiments to solve world hunger. Though Roger is skeptical of his father, William defends his experiments. Upon entering the building, they follow a set of footprints in the dust to a room that Will was warned never to enter. Going inside, they find a trail of gigantic dead rats - each larger than the last. These are followed by the bodies of a domestic cat and a dog, which are both also of enormous size. Roger begins believes that whatever food their father created must have increased the size of the animals once they ate it. So, anything that eats the superfood will do the same. Will turns on the lights to see a mass of white strands in one corner that apparently are pure protein. Concluding that something even larger killed the cat and the dog, Will and Roger follow the footsteps to an old elevator. Roger thinks that the elevator is broken but then the lights indicate that it is changing floors. When it reaches the ground, the doors open to reveal a huge spider that has grown in size due to the effects of their father's experiment. This, however, is much larger than all of the other dead animals and snatches them up with its pedipalps. It takes both brothers upward into the dark. When the elevator reaches the top, the screaming stops and one of their flashlights drop to the bottom of the shaft. Its lens is cracked and blood drips onto the floor below. Notes The title has a double-meaning, referring both to the literal elevator that the two brothers used to ride and that reveals the twist, while also to the scientist's status as an \\"elevator\\", elevating the size and status of animals, and disrupting nature in the process (e.g. moving a spider to the top of the food chain).

Overview IAAS was founded in Kathmandu in 1957 as a school of agriculture to train junior technical assistants. In 1968, the school was upgraded to a college of agriculture. Four years later it became affiliated with Tribhuvan University (TU), and moved to Rampur, Chitwan in 1974. The institute's mission is to provide higher education in agriculture and agricultural development, focusing on teaching, research, and continuing education. The government of Nepal established the Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) in Rampur in 2010, and AFU took over IAAS' physical plant and other assets. The IAAS dean's office moved to Kathmandu in 2011 and continues its programs and activities at satellite offices in Sanepa, Lalitpur and Kirtipur. The institute's postgraduate program was moved to Kathmandu in 2013, and classes are conducted in TU's Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology (RECAST) building in Kirtipur and other TU classrooms. It has a Master of Science in Agriculture (M. Sc. Ag.) program in seven departments, Master of Science in Animal Science (M.Sc. An. Sc.) and Master of Veterinary Science (M. V. Sc.) programs in two, and two Ph.D. programs (Plan A and Plan B) in several departments. In Plan A, students attend theory and practical classes in relevant subjects offered by the department. In Plan B, students conduct research and submit a progress report each semester; classes and practical work are not mandatory. The institute has collaborated with the TU central library in Kirtipur, and student access to the library has been ensured. It has donated a number of postgraduate reference books, and the library has committed to obtain books and other publications required by IAAS students. In addition to maintaining its laboratory, the institute has signed in an agreement with the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) for student practical work and research activities. The institute has involved TU professors and researchers and other governmental and non-governmental organizations. Campuses Lamjung campus View from Lamjung The Paklihawa campus is in Siddharthanagar, and the Lamjung campus is in Sundarbazar. They were established as branches of the central Rampur campus in 1976 (2032 B.S.) with the following objectives: * To produce mid-level agricultural technicians * To conduct relevant, problem-solving agricultural and animal-science research for farmers * To provide technical assistance in agriculture and animal science to farmers. With the establishment of AFU at IAAS, Rampur, both satellite IAAS campuses (Lamjung and Paklihawa, which had two-year programs) were upgraded to B.Sc.Ag. programs in 2012. The Paklihawa campus began a five- year B.V.Sc. program in 2013. Affiliated colleges TU and IAAS became affiliated with agricultural colleges in Gokuleshwar, Baitadi (2010), Lamahi Municipality and Tulsipur, Dang (both 2014). Tribhuvan University's other technical institutes are: * Institute of Engineering * Institute of Forestry * Institute of Medicine * Institute of Science and Technology  Links to other institutions  Memoranda of understanding have been signed between IAAS and national and international institutions, including the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Agro Enterprise Centre (AEC), Ministry of Agricultural and Livestock Development, Nepal Agriculture Research Council (NARC), International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, Cornell University, University of Graz, Hiroshima University, Writtle College, Asian Institute of Technology, Association of Nepalese Agricultural Professionals of Americas and Tufts University.

The premiere took place under the auspices of the Ballet Society on 19 May 1959 at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with scenery and lighting by David Hays; the conductor was Robert Irving. Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein invited Martha Graham to choreograph a joint work using all of Webern's orchestral pieces. The result was not a true collaboration but a work composed of two separate sections. Graham's contribution, Episodes I, danced by her company plus four dancers from New York City Ballet, was a depiction of the death of Mary, Queen of Scots. Dancers for this section were attired in ornate, Elizabethan costumes designed by Karinska. Episodes II, Balanchine's contribution to the work, was danced by New York City Ballet and Paul Taylor, who was then a dancer in Graham's company. This portion, definitively more abstract, dressed the performers in simple, non-descript, stark black-and-white practice clothing. The overall effect allowed Graham's portion to be perceived through a more classical focus‚Äîthough created and performed by a modern dance company‚Äîwhile Balanchine's portion was viewed in the reverse: a modernist work being created and performed by classical dancers.

The leading American colt of his generation, Hamburg was retrospectively named the American Horse of the Year for 1898. After his racing career he went on to be a successful sire. Background Hamburg was bred in Kentucky by James E. Kittson, brother to Norman W. Kittson who had been partners in Erdenheim Stud. His sire was the great Hanover by another great, Hindoo. Hamburg's dam Lady Reel was descended from Gallopade, a British broodmare who was exported to Canada in the 1830s and became the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners in North America. In 1897, he was purchased for $1,200 by the Hall of Fame trainer John E. Madden who raced him as a two-year-old. Madden said he was the hardest colt he'd ever trained. But once \\"tamed,\\" he was quick to exercise and very eager to eat. Racing career At two, Hamburg carried 129 pounds in the Double Event, Flash, and Autumn Stakes, 132 in the Electric Handicap, 134 pounds in the Congress Hall, and in the Great Eastern, he was loaded with 135 pounds. Some of his better rivals carried almost as much, but these weights were, and remain, very high, especially for a juvenile horse. On the Hall of Fame site, it states that Hamburg ‚Äúcarried the highest weights ever by a juvenile.‚Äù Hamburg was so eager to race, his rapid breaks often caused the official starter's ability to be questioned. Tod Sloan, the Hall of Fame jockey who rode him and hundreds of other horses, many of whom were highly regarded, said, \\"Hamburg was the only great horse I ever rode.\\" In December 1897, Madden sold Hamburg for $40,000 to Marcus Daly, the copper magnate, who turned him over to his trainer, Billy Lakeland. (Even so, Madden thought so much of Hamburg, he named his farm in Lexington, Kentucky Hamburg Place after him.) Marcus Daly, one of three men called the Copper Kings, maintained the Bitter Root Stock Farm in Hamilton, Montana but kept Hamburg in the East at his trainers facilities. At age three, Hamburg won for Daly as he'd won for Madden. In the Realization Stakes, he beat Plaudit, the winner of the 1898 Kentucky Derby. In the Brighton Cup, he bested the Brooklyn and Parkway Stakes winner, Howard Mann. Retirement When owner Marcus Daly died in 1900, his horses were sold, with Hamburg bringing the highest price: $60,000. William Collins Whitney bought him for stud duty. W. C. Whitney died in 1904 at which point Hamburg was then auctioned, and bought for $70,000 by his son, Harry Payne Whitney. Hamburg was the Leading sire in North America in 1905. He produced at least 27 stakes winners, including Artful, Dandelion, Burgomaster (out of the mare Hurley Burley), Pegasus, Frizette, and Borrow. He was the damsire of Regret, the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby and of another great filly, Maskette. Hamburg was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986. Hamburg died in New Jersey on September 10, 1915. Charles Cary Rumsey, an American sculptor and polo playing friend, was commissioned by Harry Whitney to create a sculpture of Hamburg.

The unit was activated in 1942 and trained through the late summer of 1944. Arriving on the Normandy coast in October, they moved to the Metz, France, area, seeing their first action in late November. In early December, they were attached to the 103rd Infantry Division, a pairing that was to last through the end of combat in Europe. The 3rd Platoon, Company C, of the 614th was the first African- American unit to receive a Distinguished Unit Citation during World War II. They received credit for the Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe campaigns. Early service The battalion was activated at Camp Carson, Colorado, on 25 July 1942, under the command of Lt. Col. Blaisdell C. Kennon. The original cadre consisted of 35 officers and 156 enlisted men, with 140 of the enlisted men coming from the 366th Infantry Regiment at Camp Devens, Massachusetts and 16 from the infantry replacement training center at Camp Wolters, Texas. Additional personnel arrived to bring the enlisted strength to 420 and basic training was started at Camp Carson. The battalion was soon ordered to Camp Bowie, Texas, arriving there on 18 December 1942. It completed basic training there and was ordered to Camp Hood, Texas, arriving on 23 March 1943. The unit began tank destroyer training with the M3 GMC destroyer but was reorganized as a towed battalion, using the 3-inch Gun M5, pulled by the M3 half-track, on 17 July 1943. On 18 July, the unit was assigned to the Tank Destroyer Center Training Brigade as school troops; assisting with training of new troops. In October, Lt. Col. Kennon was transferred and Lt. Col. Frank S. Pritchard assumed command on the 16th. Col. Pritchard would remain with the unit throughout their combat time in Europe. The battalion continued as school troops until 20 December 1943, when training prior to overseas service was started. They were ordered to the Louisiana Maneuvers area next, arriving 2 March 1944. After receiving a satisfactory rating on maneuvers, they returned to Camp Hood on 23 March 1944. Another period of intensive training ensued and by 1 June 1944, all tests had been satisfactorily completed and the unit was qualified for overseas service. The battalion received movement orders in August and after a brief stay at Camp Shanks, New York, they boarded the British ship \\"Esperance Bay\\" on 27 August and arrived in Avonmouth, near Bristol, England, on 7 September 1944. The battalion deployed into Normandy on 8 October, and moved south to Metz; it first saw action operating against the Siegfried Line on 28 November, relieving the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion which was supporting the 3rd Cavalry Group. On 1 December, the unit's first day on the line, A Company's accurate fire was instrumental in the reduction of several pillboxes and the destruction of a German 88mm gun near Borg, Germany.Lee (1966). p. 668. It was moved to VI Corps on 5 December and then attached to the 103rd Infantry Division on 5 December, deploying in the vicinity of Gougenhiem, France, where Co A was attached to Task Force Forest and Co C to the 411th Infantry Regiment. The 103rd moved into the line on 8 December, and began its attack on the 9th. On the 11th, Co B, less one platoon serving as part of the Palace Guard at the Division CP, was attached to the 411th IR. As with most tank destroyer units by this stage of the war, it only rarely fought against enemy armor; more commonly, it provided fire support against strongpoints and observation posts or indirect fire to support infantry units. Per authority, letter dated 1 December 1944, they received credit for a Battle Participation Award-Northern France Campaign, the first for the unit. On the 13th, Co A, less 1 platoon, was relieved from TF Forest and assigned to the 410th IR. Engagement at Climbach Captain Thomas being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, 1945 On 14 December, a task force of the 411th Infantry Regiment, TF Blackshear, consisting of a company of infantry, along with a platoon of tanks from the 14th Armored Division and 3rd Platoon, C Company, of the 614th TD with its towed anti-tank guns, was organized to attack Climbach, a French town just outside the German border, acting in a pincer movement. Expecting an American assault with tanks, the German defenders had prepared a strong defensive position as well as an ambush by infantry anti-tank teams. The third platoon and its towed anti-tank guns were tasked with demolishing German emplacements and defensive works. The lead vehicle was an M20 armored utility car containing Lieutenant Charles L. Thomas, the commander of the tank destroyer platoon; as it travelled up the narrow road, it was hit by heavy enemy fire and knocked out. Thomas was wounded when evacuating the vehicle, but stayed to organize the deployment of his anti-tank guns which were to provide a base of fire allowing the infantry and tanks to flank the enemy positions. The 3rd platoon remained in action for four hours, with the gun crews sometimes reduced to two out of ten men. Two of the company's guns were quickly knocked out by German artillery, then a third, but the fourth gun kept firing until it was nearly out of ammunition.Hanford, pp. 79‚Äì81. A single truck driver, T/5 Robert W. Harris, knowing the remaining gun was running out of ammunition, drove his truck to the rear for a new load and upon his return, disregarded the warning from the TF Commander that it was too dangerous to proceed. Driving to within 25 yards of the gun positions, where the truck became stuck in the mud, he unloaded and uncrated the 3\\" rounds and began carrying them to the remaining gun. The remaining members of the platoon joined him and made numerous trips carrying the ammunition, all the while under heavy enemy fire.Lee (1966). p. 669. In anticipation of ambushing the assault force, the German defenders had placed an infantry company in the nearby woods. When the men of C Company began deploying their towed guns, the German infantry attacked the anti-tank guns, and C Company's men, though armed only with M1 carbines, .45 pistols, and submachine guns, responded in kind. One half-track driver, surprised from behind by a German infantry squad, mowed down eight of his attackers with several blasts from his .45 caliber grease gun. Despite heavy casualties, the 614th repulsed the German infantry attack, killing most of the assault force. By nightfall, when the engagement ended, only sporadic small-arms fire came from the town, which was quickly seized by American troops. Defeated, surviving enemy forces retired to the Siegfried Line. The platoon took heavy losses, with more than half its men listed as killed or wounded; three of the four guns were put out of action, and two half-tracks and an armored car were destroyed.Gill (1992). p. 81. The divisional report recorded that the \\"outstanding performance of mass heroism on the part of the officers and men of Company C, 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion, precluded a near catastrophic reverse for the task force\\". The 3rd Platoon received the Distinguished Unit Citation for this engagement;Lee (1966). p. 670. it was not only a first for a unit attached to the 103rd Division, but also the first African-American unit to receive the citation. Platoon members were awarded nine Bronze Stars, four Silver Stars (two posthumously), and Lieutenant Thomas, who had been seriously wounded, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Orders were received for the battalion to move to Neufvillage, France, on 22 Dec 1944, and upon arrival they reverted to the control of XV Corps for operations. The Battalion Commander was assigned as Anti-Tank Officer, in charge of AT defense in the division sector, by the 103rd ID. On 28 December, the Commanding General of the 103rd ID personally pinned medals on two officers and eight enlisted men for their actions on 14 December as part of TF Blackshear. In the 1990s, a study indicated severe racial discrimination in the process of awarding medals during the war, and it was recommended that seven Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to Medals of Honor, an award for which, while technically eligible, none would have been considered at the time. One of these seven was Lieutenant Thomas, and he was accordingly awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously on 13 January 1997. A winter on the defensive The closing days of 1944 found the gun companies assigned as follows: Company A with the 410th IR, Company C with the 411th IR and Company B with various part-time assignments, which included guarding the division CP, attachment to the 44th Infantry Division or the 106th Cavalry Group and at times with the battalion CP. The companies participated in a number of small engagements and, at one point, fired artillery missions on attachment to the 928th Field Artillery Battalion. Notable engagements included one on 1 January ‚Äì where an isolated outpost killed nine and captured two of an enemy patrol in a small-arms firefight ‚Äì or 12 January, when a two-gun section fired 143 rounds over forty minutes at an observation post, scoring 139 direct hits ‚Äì a rate of a round every thirty-five seconds from each gun, with 97% accuracy. When the 103rd Division moved back to prepared lines in the Hagenau Forest on 20 January, the battalion withdrew alongside them. Weather conditions, with snow and ice-covered roads, proved to be unfavorable for the 614th's equipment with three 3\\" guns and six half-tracks having to be abandoned and destroyed in situ. The 2nd platoon of Company C did manage to save a 3\\" gun by eventually reaching safety pulling it, and carrying the platoon leader and 14 men, with a 1/4 ton \\"jeep\\". On the 25th, Company C was stationed in Schillersdorf when approximately 450 German SS troops attacked. All the men were able to vacate the town except for one officer and 11 enlisted men who were captured. All of the men were liberated and returned home after the war. The battalion remained on the defensive through February, helping fend off raiding parties and infiltrating patrols, and mounted a platoon-strength raid itself that month, with great success. Five members of the unit were awarded Bronze Stars for their part in the raid. The record of this engagement in the contemporary divisional history described the battalion as \\"the crack negro 614th\\", testifying to the high regard in which the unit was held by the 103rd.Lee (1966). p. 671. Advance into Germany Seventh Army's spring offensive began on 15 March, and the 614th moved forward alongside the 103rd. As before, its companies were split up, one to each infantry regiment; each also possessed a company of the 761st Tank Battalion, another all-black unit. Company A captured the town of Kindwiller with a group of dismounted soldiers, while the battalion reconnaissance company raided Bischholtz and took forty-one prisoners. The advance continued to the Rhine, where the division halted and began a period of military occupation. The end of March saw the battalion located around Waldsee, Germany. On 7 April, the battalion CP was located at Momlingen, Germany, with the companies occupying Neidernberg, Stockstadt, Erlenbach, Ostheim and Momlingen, continuing to perform occupation duties. On 11 April, per General Order No. 141, Headquarters Seventh Army, the 3rd platoon, Company C, was cited for outstanding performance of duty in action against the enemy on 14 December 1944, in the vicinity of Climbach, France. The division ‚Äì and the 614th ‚Äì moved forward again on 21 April, in pursuit of a retreating enemy, seeing sporadic opposition. On 22 April, one NCO was killed, 6 EM captured and one NCO missing when their vehicle was ambushed near Hegenlohe, Germany. On 24 April, the captured EM were released and reported to the Bn CP. Elements of the 44th Infantry Division had contacted a German column, and after a fire fight, many prisoners were captured and a number of Germans killed. During the confusion, the EM were released by the Germans and told to get back to their proper units. The battalion's last combat casualties were on 2 May near Scharnitz, Austria, losing seven men ( 5 KIA, 1 WIA, 1 captured) of a task force pushing towards Innsbruck. The next day, a platoon of Company C was attached to a force sent to seize the Brenner Pass, which they did on the 4th without any opposition, and push through to meet the lead elements of the 88th Infantry Division driving up from Italy. Post War Service 7 May found the battalion, minus Company B, at Leutasch and Ober Leutasch, Austria. Company B was in Moserne and later moved to Telfs. Here the battalion was able to rest. On 12 May, General McAuliffe pinned Silver Stars on Captain Walter S. Smith, 1st Lt. Serreo S. Nelson and Lt Christopher J. Sturkey, while his staff pinned the ribbons of the Distinguished Unit Citation on members of the 3rd Platoon of Company C. Officers and men had passes and furloughs until early July when the unit was alerted to move. On the 10th they were ordered to move to Marseilles, France. Here it was found the battalion was to be broken up and the men sent to service units, but after General McAuliffe and others had intervened, the orders were changed and the battalion awaited orders to ship to the Pacific or be assigned to occupation duties in Europe. But, the war in the Pacific ended too and on 10 September 1945, the battalion received orders to return to Germany. On the 25th, the battalion CP was established at Hofheim with the companies occupying nearby towns. They remained on occupation duty until early 1946 when they were ordered to return to the U.S. The 614th was deactivated on 31 January 1946, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.. The battalion was reactivated as a Negro General Reserve Unit at Camp Hood, Texas, on 30 June 1946, pursuant to General Orders No. 20, Headquarters, 2nd Armored Division dated 27 June 1946. Activated under the command of Lt. Col. Delmer P. Anderson, the 614th received its first shipment of fillers on 1 July from the Overseas Replacement Depot, Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, all of whom were regular Army re-enlistees originally intended for European duty. Additional personnel arrived during July and August. On 19 August, Lt. Col. Henry W. Allerd assumed command, relieving Lt. Col. Anderson. A 13-week individual training program was started the 3rd week of July. On 3 September, the battalion received two M18 Hellcat tank destroyers to be used for preliminary training. Effective 1 November 1946, per General Orders No. 43, Headquarters, Second Armored Division, dated 19 October 1946, the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion was deactivated.

Biography Born in Oujda, Morocco in 1950, Marciano's family immigrated to Israel before his first birthday, where he grew up in the Musrara neighborhood of Jerusalem. He was inspired by the example of the Black Panthers to organise a national movement to liberate Mizrahi Jews, and founded the Israeli Black Panthers in 1971. The organisation's name was attributed to Marciano by Kochavi Shemesh, who claimed that it was chosen to frighten Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. In 1972, Marciano was part of a Black Panthers group who moved milk bottles from middle-class neighbourhoods to poor ones. During a demonstration, he was given a black eye by a police officer, and this brought him to national attention. The group collapsed the following year, but he continued to campaign for equality, and also set up a drug rehabilitation centre. The Black Panthers joined the Left Camp of Israel party prior to the 1977 elections, and Marciano received a top five spot on their list. The party won two seats in the Knesset, and Marciano was one of five people to hold one, on a rotation basis. He entered the Knesset in May 1980, but in November he left the party and sat as an independent MK, before forming the Equality in Israel - Panthers party. After being joined by Mordechai Elgrably, the party changed its name to the Unity Party. However, the party failed to cross the 1% electoral threshold in the 1981 elections and Marciano was therefore not re- elected. A relative of Marciano, Yoram Marciano, was also a member of the Knesset.

Phone connectors 100px Photo: 2.5 mm mono (TS), 3.5 mm mono and stereo (TRS), and 1/4‚Ä≥ (6.35 mm) stereo (TRS) phone connectors The most common microphone connector in consumer use is the venerable phone connector, in 1/4\\" (6.35 mm), 3.5 mm, and 2.5 mm sizes, and in both mono and stereo configurations. Not all microphone plugs with 3-segment TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) connectors are actually stereo. Most computer microphones use the third segment to carry bias power for the microphone. Type \\"O\\" 1930's Connectors These round connectors are about 1 inch in diameter. They were in common use in the later 40's and thru the 50's at WELI, New Haven Connecticut. see: http://terryking.us/OldRadio/OP-4-RCA-RemoteAmplifier-1934-Rear.jpg The 3 connectors on the left are 1934 type \\"P\\" round microphone connectors.

They looked like this: http://terryking.us/OldRadio/UA-3-12.jpg SwitchCraft 2501F This is the part number for a Swichcraft connector used with high impedance microphones up through about 1980. It was intended for coax style cable up to outside diameter. Attachment is made with a 5/8-27 threaded ring that can be unthreaded over the body of the connector body allowing the female connector to become a male connector. Wire connection was via solder. The center conductor is soldered to a hole resulting in a flat center contact. The cable shield is soldered to the strain-relief spring which is held in the body of the connector with a set screw. With no provision for spring loading of the connection ring, vibration tends to loosen the threaded ring and create intermittent contact. Amphenol 80-series and 91-Series Popular microphone connector from 1930s to 1980s, originally manufactured by Amphenol. Amphenol sold this production to WPI Interconnect in early 1980s. The Amphenol 80-MC2M microphone connector was popular with American radio manufacturers (1950s to 1970s). XLR connectors (Mid-50's to today)  XLR3 cable connectors, female on left and male on right Most commonly used on professional microphones, the common 3-pin XLR connector is a standard for transferring balanced audio among professional audio equipment. The 4-pin XLR is the standard connector for intercom headsets, such as systems made by ClearCom and Telex. Two pins are used for the mono headphone signal and two pins for the unbalanced microphone signal. The 4-pin XLR connector is also commonly used on amateur radio microphones, but transferring unbalanced audio instead, and using the 4th pin (with the common ground) for a push-to-talk (PTT) circuit activated by a button on the microphone. Some broadcast radio professionals also use these microphones, instead using the PTT circuit as a cough button (a momentary mute button) so that they may cough, clear their throat, or make comments to others in the studio without the sounds being broadcast. It is also used for dmx512 digital stage controls. Multi-pin Circular Connector (MCC, CBC-series, Foster, GX-16) First used in the 1970s by Japanese radio manufacturers, as an alternative to the German DIN connector standard for microphone connectors on Citizens Band and Amateur Radio equipment, these screw-on circular connectors were available with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 pins. They often were used for other purposes as well, such as 1970s amateur radio transceivers (microphone), 1970s Kenwood mobile radios (2-pin, DC power), Eastern Asian manufacturers built soldering stations in 1990s using the conne tor fir the iron/handpiece connector. As reported by Philmore-Datel (LKG Industries of Rockford, IL), the USA importer and distributor for these connectors, the original Japanese mfg. (Foster) ceased production. After the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami (loss of factories), connector manufacturing moved from Japan to Taiwan and mainland China manufacturers. These connectors are sold under a variety of generic names: \\"CB connector\\", \\"Mobile connector\\", \\"Microphone connector\\", \\"Power connector\\" ‚Äî even sometimes misidentified as XLR connectors. The Chinese mainland (and Taiwan) manufacturers adopted this connector as the ‚ÄúGX16‚Äù (16mm), for ‚ÄúPower‚Äù or ‚ÄúAvionics‚Äù usage. You can find the Chinese ‚ÄúGX series‚Äù used as a multi-voltage connector (soldering stations, avionics, marine, etc.). Google or eBay search ‚ÄúGX16‚Äù , and you will find hundreds of vendors, such as Renhotecpro, based in Guangdong, China. http://www.renhotecpro.com/gx16-connector-data-sheet/ Renhotecpro has standardized the manufacturing of GX-series, in a variety of sizes, by the diameter of the connector (in mm): GX12, GX16, GX20, GX25, GX30, GX35, GX40. Even though this circular connector is largely standardized, there was NO industry standard for wiring or pin usage/assignments. The individual pin assignments to specific functions varied from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, in amateur radio, Icom, Kenwood, and Yaesu radios have all used the 8-pin screw-on connector, yet microphones from one brand are incompatible with the other two brands, at least without the use of an adapter cable in between the microphone and the radio. Modular connectors Although originally designed for telephone usage and later adopted for computer networking, the Modular connector has been used for microphone connections extensively on modern amateur radio equipment, including models from the three major manufacturers (Icom, Kenwood, and Yaesu), but primarily used on mobile radio equipment (designed to be mounted in vehicles). Like the screw-on round microphone connectors, there is little standardization among manufacturers, and even among different models from the same manufacturer, leading to significant interoperability problems when connecting non-OEM or homebrew microphones and other equipment. Most radios with modular microphone connectors use the 8P8C (vernacular: RJ45) connector, but some use 6P6C or 4P4C connectors.

Originally ruled by Roman-Catholic bishops, after 1586 it was ruled by lay administrators and bishops who were members of the Protestant Holstein-Gottorp line of the House of Oldenburg. The prince- bishops had seat and vote on the Ecclesiastical Bench of the College of Ruling Princes of the Imperial Diet. The Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck, a secular state, should not be confused with the Diocese of L√ºbeck, which was larger and over which the bishop exercised only pastoral authority. History Territory of the Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck The original diocese was founded about 970 by Emperor Otto I in the Billung March at Oldenburg in Holstein (Aldinborg or Starigard), the former capital of the pagan Wagri tribe. Oldenburg was then a suffragan diocese of the Archbishopric of Bremen, meant to missionize the Obotrites. However, in the course of the 983 Slavic uprising (see Lutici), the Wagri shook off Imperial supremacy and in 1038, the bishops were barred from entering their diocese. In 1052, the dioceses of Ratzeburg and Schwerin were split off from Oldenburg and no bishop was appointed after 1066. After the Saxon count Henry of Badewide had campaigned in the Wagrian lands east of the Limes Saxoniae in 1138/39, a new Bishop of Oldenburg, Vicelinus, was appointed in 1149. Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony moved the seat of the diocese from Oldenburg to L√ºbeck in 1160. When the Duchy of Saxony was dissolved with Henry's deposition in 1180, the Bishopric gained the status of Imperial State (). Quarrels arose after the City of L√ºbeck gained imperial immediacy in 1226 and as the territory of the state was centered on Eutin, the town in 1309 became the residence of the bishops. L√ºbeck Cathedral. The Bishopric did not attempt to fight the Protestant Reformation. In 1531 the Free City of L√ºbeck, instanced by Johannes Bugenhagen, had turned Protestant, further inhibiting Catholic pastoring in the part of the L√ºbeck diocese under city rule. And in 1535 the L√ºbeck cathedral chapter and subsequently all its diocesan territories adopted the Lutheran confession. The Prince-Bishop was elected by the chapter; since 1586, all administrators of the prince-bishopric were members of the Holstein-Gottorp line of the House of Oldenburg. After the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, L√ºbeck was one of only two Protestant prince-bishoprics in the Empire (together with Osnabr√ºck, which however was alternately led by Protestant and Catholic bishops). Principality and Region of L√ºbeck With the of 1803, the Prince-Bishopric was mediatized. It became the Principality of L√ºbeck and was given to the Duchy of Oldenburg, since the last prince- bishop (Peter I of Holstein-Gottorp) was also prince regent of Oldenburg. In 1803 the principality comprised 9.5 German square milesOne German sq. mile () = 21.25 Eng. sq. miles or 55.05 km2. with 22,000 inhabitants. Its capital was Eutin. The coat-of-arms of the Principality of L√ºbeck as of 1829. Between 1810 and 1814 the principality was annexed to France as part of the , before it was restituted to the Duchy of Oldenburg. The Duchy of Oldenburg, named after its capital Oldenburg in Oldenburg, thus shared its name with the town of Oldenburg in Holstein, the original seat of the Bishopric, only by coincidence. The Oldenburgian exclaves: the Principality of L√ºbeck as of 1868 (top) and the Principality of Birkenfeld (bottom). Following the Austro- Prussian War in 1867 the principality was enlarged by the prior Holsteinian bailiwick of Ahrensb√∂k, as a compensation for hereditary claims of the ducal House of Oldenburg to Holstein. After Oldenburg became a republic in 1918 the area remained an exclave of the Free State of Oldenburg now named Region of L√ºbeck (). Coat-of-arms of the District of Eutin. In 1937 the region was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein by a territorial redeployment according to the Greater Hamburg Act. The Region of L√ºbeck then became the District of Eutin, which was merged with the neighbouring District of Oldenburg in Holstein in the new district of Eastern Holstein in 1970. The Lutheran Church, since the Protestant Reformation comprising the majority of the inhabitants, remained a separate entity, named Evangelical Lutheran State Church of the Oldenburgian Region of L√ºbeck (, chaired by a land provost or bishop in Eutin) until it merged with neighbouring Landeskirchen in the new North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church in 1977.

Beck was one quarter Native Alaskan, a cause of both conflict and inspiration during his career. His work ranged from industrial assemblages and happenings in the 60's to large, abstract public commissions in the 70's to Yup'ik masks inspired by traditional Yup'ik pieces, but rendered with modern industrial and manufactured materials which he began in the 80's and was working on up until his death. Life Beck's father was American, his mother was Norwegian/Yup'ik from Alaska. He was raised in Seattle and attended the University of Washington, earning a B.A. in painting (with a minor in art history and ceramics) in 1964 and an M.F.A. in sculpture in 1965. Among Beck's teachers at UW were George Tsutakawa and Everett Du Pen and visiting New York artist Gabriel Kohn. Beck also worked as an assistant to Mark di Suvero on a large sculpture installation for Virginia and Bagley Wright. He taught at the University of Oregon, Eugene was a Visiting Instructor of Sculpture for the 1966-67 academic year. The years 1967-68 were spent as a visiting Fine Arts Fellow at the University of Southampton, England. Returning to the Northwest, Beck moved to the Skagit Valley. The Northwest scene in the sixties included then art critic (now novelist) Tom Robbins. Work From the time he graduated with his M.F.A., Beck made formalist, abstract, large scale sculpture in the manner of his abstract-expressionist training and began to establish his reputation as a sculptor. His earliest pieces were largely made of found metals and objects assembled in a lyrical, yet humorous manner. He was also (with Tom Robbins and others) part of the Shazam Society which produced performance and \\"happenings\\". He accumulated many awards and honors and his first Art in Public Places commission (1971), which would have placed a fountain in Pioneer Square at Occidental Park. That piece was never realized, but between 1975 and 1980 he won three other major commissions for work to be installed at Golden Gardens Park, Highline Community College (Poktalaruk 'huk shuk, 1978), and the King County International Airport. Though raised in Seattle, away from his mother's tribal heritage, in the mid-70's, Beck visited the Alaskan coast and for the first time began to understand the spirit-filled Yup'ik culture. In 1973, Beck developed a new series of minimalist pieces that he entitled \\"Inukshuk\\" which is Inuit for sculptural presence (such as, a stone landmark). This term was also used for the three major commissions that followed. The introduction of Inuit terminology was the first sign that Beck was consciously bringing his multi- cultural heritage into his work. He experimented with casting several small masks, based on traditional Inuit forms, in aluminum and bronze, but he was still uncomfortable with the fact that the masks represented a complete contradiction to his western art training. This and peer group pressure kept him doing abstract work. After the 1980 installation of his major commission at the King County Airport, Beck experienced what he would call his sculpture career crisis. He became disenchanted with public art. Many artists of the times were losing interest in non-objective forms‚ÄîBeck was not alone in seeking subjects that spoke specifically to his existential needs. The years of research into his family history and a desire to integrate his Alaskan awareness into his art finally led to his commitment to making masks ‚Äì modern interpretations of traditional Inuit spirit forms ‚Äì leaving the world of large, abstract public art commissions behind. As native Alaskan artists had gleaned inspiration and materials from the shores of Norton Sound, Beck scoured his urban environment ‚Äì junkyards, hardware stores, the local five and dime ‚Äì for the raw materials for his masks. Old rearview mirrors, baby moon hubcaps, discarded whitewall tires, surplus airplane rivets, kitchen implements, even kids' toys became part of the masks that eventually brought him international acclaim. Beck used the word \\"Inua\\" in titling his masks. This is the native term for \\"spirit\\" and it was his hope that each mask was imbued with enough Inua to satisfy the spirit debt he felt was owed to his Inuit heritage. One of his masks, Punk Bear Spirit from 1984, can be seen in Washington's State Art Collection. Papers and photos from Beck's estate are in the Archives of the National Museum of the American Indian of the Smithsonian Institution. Exhibitions Beck's masks were shown around the U.S. and abroad in exhibitions such as \\"The Eloquent Object\\" (1987‚Äì89), a traveling show from the Philbrook Museum of Art, Tulsa, Oklahoma; the Heard Museum's 3rd Biennial (1987‚Äì88) in Phoenix, Arizona and \\"No Beads, No Trinkets\\" (1984) at the Palais des Nations, United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, curated by Edgar Heap of Birds and in galleries in Reno, Nevada; Kansas City, Missouri; San Antonio, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His masks are also in collections at the Anchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center and the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian. His early, abstract work was shown throughout the Northwest in various galleries and museums, including the Portland Art Museum; the Seattle Art Museum; \\"West Coast Now -- Current Art from the Western Seaboard\\" (1968), Seattle-Los Angeles; the Henry Gallery at the University of Washington, Seattle; and the Polly Friedlander Gallery, Seattle.

Biography =Early life= Gluck was born on 4 March 1916 in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, the daughter of Pinhas Gluck-Friedman (1886‚Äì1964) and Henia Shipper (1887‚Äì1968). Her father was a direct descendant of Hasidic Masters, going back to the Magid Dov Ber of Mezeritch (1704‚Äì1772), the disciple and successor of the Baal Shem Tov (1698‚Äì1760). She had two sisters, Antoinette Feuerwerker (1912-2003) and Hendel (Hedwig) Naftalis (1913-?), and a brother Salomon Gluck (born 1914-died during WWII). =Strasbourg and Paris= Her parents had moved from Tarn√≥w in Galicia, Poland, to Belgium, then to Switzerland, during World War I. The family moved further to Germany, and finally to France in 1921, settling in Strasbourg. There she went to the famous Lyc√©e des Pontonniers, now called Lyc√©e International des Pontonniers. After moving to Paris, with her family, she studied in 1941 and 1942 to become a nurse, in the modern Ecole de pu√©riculture, 26, boulevard Brune, in Paris 14. She worked before World War II at the COJASOR, a Jewish social service organization, together with Lucie Dreyfus (n√©e Hadamard; 1869‚Äì1945), the widow of Alfred Dreyfus. =French Resistance= During World War II, she joined her sister, Antoinette Feuerwerker, and her husband, Rabbi David Feuerwerker, in Brive-la-Gaillarde. They worked together with Edmond Michelet, the future Senior Minister of Charles de Gaulle, in the major Movement of the French Resistance, Combat. In Michelet's Memoirs, she is mentioned as one of the active agents for Combat. Her name in the R√©sistance was Marie Rose Girardin. She was arrested in the Synagogue of Brive in March 1944, taken to Drancy internment camp, and from there, on convoy 72, on 29 April 1944, to Auschwitz concentration camp. Her sister Antoinette Feuerwerker succeeded in getting her a nurse's uniform when she was at Drancy internment camp. She wore that uniform on her arrival in Auschwitz. Dr Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor, singled her out for survival. Later, he operated on her, without anesthesia. She survived three selections in Auschwitz concentration camp (Auschwitz-Birkenau), and later was transferred to the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, before being liberated by the Russian Army in February 1945. The number tattooed on her arm at Auschwitz was 80598. Underneath there is a triangle, meaning she is a Jew. =Auschwitz= Convoy 72 took her to Auschwitz on 29 April 1944. Serge Klarsfeld described the convoy: This convoy takes 1004 Jews, and includes 398 men and 606 women. Among them were 174 children below 18. The poet Itzak Katznelson (Itzhak Katzenelson) is among the deportees of this convoy, as well as many Poles, arrested as he was in Vittel, after having been transferred from Poland. There are families: the children Dodelzak, Ita 12, Georges 3 and Arkadius 3 months; the Rottenberg, Naphtalie 7, Nathan 5, Esther 4, Frantz 2,... On arrival at Auschwitz, 48 men were selectioned with the numbers 186596 to 186643 and 52 women, whose numbers are around 80600. In 1945, there were 37 survivors, including 25 women. Her brother, Dr. Salomon Gluck was deported on the next convoy, convoy 73, leaving Drancy internment camp on 15 May 1944. At Birkenau, she was assigned to a group of 50 women who were forced by a kapo to knit undershirts for German newborns. She worked hard, and was well thought- of, but when they were asked to knit socks for men, she resisted by making big knots inside the garments so as to render them unusable. In her block in Auschwitz was another detainee that she saw daily, the future politician Simone Veil. = Gross-Rosen = The Gross-Rosen concentration camp was situated near Breslau (called today Wroc≈Çaw in Poland) railway station. There Warfman was made to work in a munitions factory from six in the evening to six in the morning, with one half-hour break, and regular beatings. =Later life= After the war, she returned to Paris. She became the first and only employee of the new Israeli Airlines, El Al, when it opened in Paris, with a director, Mr. Massis. She welcomed and guided many Israeli leaders during their stays in Paris, including Golda Meir, and David Ben-Gurion. She was involved in the adventure of the Exodus (ship) (Exodus1947). Together with Abb√© Alexandre Glasberg, recognized posthumously as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem, Jerusalem, Israel, for saving Jews during the war, she made the false identity cards for the passengers of the Exodus. Honors She was awarded the title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor by the French Government for her work in the R√©sistance, on 10 February 1959. She also was awarded la M√©daille Militaire 1939‚Äì1945, la Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945, and la Croix du combattant volontaire de la R√©sistance.

He is best known for his final film, the partly suppressed Titanic, during the production of which he was arrested by Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. He was later found dead in his prison cell. Life and career Herbert Selpin was born on 29 May 1904 in Berlin. After his medical studies in the same city, Selpin worked as a dancer, boxer, librarian, and art seller before he obtained, in the mid-1920s, an internship at the prestigious UFA film studios. Among other assignments at UFA, he worked on the set of Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's Faust (1926). Selpin was subsequently employed by the European subsidiary of the Fox Film Corporation, where he held several positions, including - in 1927 - that of director's assistant to Walther Ruttmann on the set of Berlin: Sinfonie einer Gro√üstadt. After several positions as editor, Selpin received an assignment as director for Chauffeur Antoinette, released in 1931 by Excelsior Films. In the following two years, Selpin ran into conflict with the Nazi Party for his sympathetic portrayals of the British in his films. From 1933 onwards he made propaganda films for the UFA studios, which was by then under the control of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. After several propaganda films that were not well received (Schwarzhemden in 1933, Die Reiter von Deutsch-Ostafrika in 1934, and Alarm in Peking in 1937), Selpin was successful in 1941 with Carl Peters, an anti-British film. This was followed by another propaganda film Geheimakte W.B.1 in 1941‚Äì42. Selpin was chosen by Goebbels to direct Titanic, intended by the Minister to be both a blockbuster hit and effective anti-British propaganda. The story of the doomed ship was re-written by Walter Zerlett-Olfenius to put blame on J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line, and his British and American capitalist backers who, according to the screenplay, wanted the ship to make the passage as quickly as possible, no matter what the danger was to the passengers, in order to gain advantage in the line's competition with the Cunard Line, and thereby to make as much money as they could. A German character was also introduced who warned about the danger the ship was in by traveling so quickly. In 1942, on the set of Titanic, after having experienced many time-consuming problems caused by drunk German sailors and soldiers acting as extras for the film, Selpin made several remarks critical of the military. He was denounced for these remarks by Zerlett-Olfenius, once his personal friend, and, upon failing to retract his statements during a meeting with Joseph Goebbels, was arrested on 31 July 1942.Saunders, Christopher. \\"Goebbels‚Äô Prize Victims: Joachim Gottschalk and Herbert Selpin\\" Sound on Sight (July 26, 2015) Death The day after his arrest, Selpin was found dead in his cell, hanging by his trouser suspenders. A rumor circulated that he had been murdered on the orders of Goebbels, as the Gestapo had taken an interest in the matter and Goebbels considered it more prudent to sacrifice the director than spar with the Gestapo. (WebCite archive) According to the rumor, around midnight on 31 July ‚Äì 1 August 1942, two guards entered Selpin's cell: Despite Goebbels' attempt to conceal the truth, Selpin's brutal death quickly spread to Berlin's film colony who were deeply angered at Zerlett-Olfenius. Goebbels retaliated by issuing a proclamation decreeing that anyone shunning the screenwriter would answer to him in person, and be subjected to the same fate as Selpin. It also ordered that Selpin's name not be mentioned on the Titanic set or elsewhere. The production of Titanic was subsequently completed by Werner Klingler, who was not credited. The film itself - which cost almost 4 million Reichmarks, or the 2013 equivalent of US$180 millionLebovic, Matt. \\"Goebbels‚Äô ‚ÄòTitanic‚Äô cinematic disaster turns 70\\" The Times of Israel (October 1, 2013) - was almost completely suppressed by Goebbels, who worried that the ship's disaster would demoralize the German public. It was shown a few times in occupied countries, and later, in a re-edited version, in East Germany.

This film was directed by E. Sathibabu and produced by Mullapudi Brahmanandam. It's a remake of Tamil blockbuster movie Kaadhal Kondein, which starred Dhanush and Sonia Agarwal in lead roles. The film was a flop at the box office but received good critical acclaim, mainly for Allari Naresh's performance as a psychotic lover. Plot Vinod, who has grown up under the care of a church father, is an introvert but a genius. He is forcibly sent to a college in Vizag by the father but is a complete misfit in class. Though shunned by the rest of his class, Divya becomes his friend and he gradually warms up to her too. His feelings soon turn into love but he realizes that Divya considers him as only a friend. But he is unwilling to let her go. Meanwhile, Vinod learns that Divya is in love with another classmate, Abhi. Divya's father is enraged on learning about her love. He shuts her up and prevents her from contacting anyone. But Vinod comes and meets her on the pretext of getting some old clothes for himself to wear. Pitied by Vinod, her father allows him. But Vinod uses the chance and escapes with Divya. He convinces her that she will meet Abhi at the Jungle. Vinod has set up a secret place in that jungle for executing his plan of wooing Divya. He makes her stay with him, while convincing her by talking about the never-impending Abhi's arrival. On one such day, he reveals his miserable past, when he was made to work for paid labour after being orphaned at an early age. He revolts against the oppression one day against the illegal child labour in vogue at his place. Promptly he is beaten black and blue for his profanity. Moreover, he also loses his girlfriend to rapists in that place, who also kill her. Somehow he manages to escape from them and seeks refuge in the place of a church father. Divya is really touched by his past. Incidentally the police and Abhi arrive at the place. While Vinod was away to get some food, they try to make Divya understand that Vinod was a psychopath. Yet Divya scoffs at their claims, citing his gentlemanly behavior over the days she was put up alone with him. Vinod, learning that the police have arrived at the scene, begins to indulge in mass violence. He opens fire, killing a police constable. Forcing them out of their hideout, he manages to evade the police Inspector and Abhi and successfully brings Divya back to their original place of stay. Divya soon identifies the tiger out of the cow's skin. Vinod pleads with her, telling her that all he wanted in his life was her presence with him. But Divya called him a friend and stated her inability to accept him as her partner for life. Meanwhile, Abhi regains consciousness and comes back to attack Vinod and rescue his girlfriend. A violent fight follows, where Vinod defies his puny self and treats Abhi with disdain. The fight culminates with Vinod, Abhi and Divya teetering at the edge of a slippery cliff. While Divya clutches a tree bark tightly, Vinod and Abhi slip out and barely manage to hold either of her hands. Divya is forced to a situation where she needs to choose between her boyfriend and friend. Abhi's pleas notwithstanding, Divya doesn't have the heart to kill Vinod. The epic of a cliffhanger finally ends with Vinod smiling wryly at Divya and letting go of her hands himself. He falls to his death into the abyss.

Poppe (, Nikol√°j/N√≠kolas Nikol√°jeviƒç Poppe; July 27, 1897 ‚Äì August 8, 1991) was an important Russian linguist. He is also known as Nikolaus Poppe, with his first name in its German form. He is often cited as N.N. Poppe in academic publications. Poppe was a leading specialist in the Mongolic languages and the hypothetical Altaic language family to which, in the view of many linguists, the Mongolic, Turkic, and Tungusic languages belong. Poppe was open-minded toward the inclusion of Korean in Altaic, but regarded the evidence for the inclusion of Korean as less strong than that for the inclusion of Mongolic, Turkic, and Tungusic.  Life  Nicholas Poppe's father was stationed in China as a consular officer in the Russian diplomatic service. Poppe was born in Yantai, Shandong, China, on July 27, 1897. Poppe's boyhood and youth were marked by wars: the Boxer Rebellion, the Russo-Japanese War, the First World War, and the Russian Civil War, which was followed by the establishment of the Soviet regime. Later, he experienced Stalin's Great Purge and the Second World War. Poppe began teaching at the Institute for Modern Oriental Languages in 1920 at the age of 23. Three years later, in 1923, he began teaching at the University of Leningrad. In 1931, he was appointed head of the Department of Mongolian Studies in the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1933, at the age of 36, he was elected as the youngest associate member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. During World War II Poppe lived in the Caucasus, in a region which was overtaken by the Germans. Poppe served as a translator between the local population and the German invaders. When the Germans withdrew he and his family also took the opportunity to leave the Soviet Union. In 1943 Poppe moved with his family to Berlin. There, Poppe began working at the SS-affiliated Wannsee Institut, a research institute that studied the politics and economics of the Soviet Union.The Wannsee Institut is unrelated to the 1942 Wannsee Conference at which the extermination of the Jews of German-occupied Europe was planned. After the war, he spent several years underground in hiding from the Soviets. In 1949, he managed to emigrate to the United States, where he joined the faculty of the Far East and Russian Institute at the University of Washington. He continued teaching there up to his retirement in 1968. In 1968, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bonn. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences in 1968 and again in 1977. In May 1989, a group of graduate students interested in Central and Inner Asian Studies initiated the first Nicholas Poppe Symposium. Poppe attended its first meeting in 1989 and the second in 1990. He was invited to the third meeting in May 1991 but was unable to attend on account of the state of his health. Poppe died in June 1991 in Seattle at the age of 94.  Academic career  Poppe spoke fluent Mongolian and attained an unmatched familiarity with Mongolian oral literature. His research focused on studies of the Altaic language family, especially Khalkha-Mongolian and Buriat-Mongolian, and on studies of the folklore of these and related languages. He wrote manuals and grammars of written and colloquial Khalkha-Mongolian and Buriat-Mongolian, Yakut, the Alar dialect, and Bashkir. His publications in the realm of Mongolian oral literature include eleven volumes of Mongolian epics, collections of Mongolian sayings, songs, and fairy tales, and Mongolian versions of works in Sanskrit. After 1949, Poppe wrote mostly in German and English, in addition to Russian. Regardless of the language he used, his writing was remarkable for its simplicity and clarity. As a result, his works are easily comprehensible to specialists and non-specialists alike.  Works  Poppe was an exceptionally prolific scholar. A bibliography of his publications from 1924 to 1987 includes 284 books and articles and 205 book reviews. Between 1949 and 1968 -- a period during which he was teaching 16 to 17 hours a week at the University of Washington, with only three months in the summer for uninterrupted research -- he wrote 217 works, including over 40 books. The secret of his high productivity, as he jokingly described it, was that while other people were enjoying \\"the beautiful surroundings of Seattle, climbing the mountains or sailing the waters\\", \\"he sits at his desk, wearing out one typewriter after the other like other people wear out their shoes\\".

E. (Ted) Hill. 1930s The Fleet Model 1 (originally the Consolidated Model 14 Husky Junior) and its derivatives were a family of two-seat trainer and sports biplanes produced in the United States and Canada in the 1920s and 1930s. They all shared the same basic design and varied mainly in their powerplants.  Development  The Fleet Model 1 and its derivatives were all orthodox biplanes with staggered, single-bay wings of equal span and fixed tailskid undercarriage. Accommodation was provided for two in tandem, originally sharing a single open cockpit, but in most examples in separate open cockpits. The fuselage was made of welded steel tube with triangular-layout Warren truss construction pattern side structures typical of the time, and the wings had a wooden spar with duralumin ribs, the entire aircraft being fabric-covered. Despite a superficial resemblance to Consolidated's highly successful Trusty and Husky designs (hence the \\"Husky Junior\\" nickname), the Model 14 was an all-new design. Originally created as a means for Consolidated to enter the civil market, the company abandoned this ambition shortly before the completion of the first prototype. The manufacturing rights were purchased by designer and Consolidated company president Reuben Fleet to put into production under his new enterprise, Fleet Aircraft. It was an immediate success, and in the first year of production alone, over 300 machines were sold. Consolidated quickly responded by buying Fleet Aircraft and retaining it as a subsidiary while opening a second production line at Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada. The Canadian manufacturing was a great success, with some 600 examples built for the Royal Canadian Air Force as the Fleet Fawn (Model 7) and Fleet Finch (Model 16). A small number of U.S.-built machines were purchased by the U.S. military, including a batch evaluated by the United States Army Air Corps as the PT-16 but not bought in quantity. One initial prototype aircraft and six subsequent specialised production N2Y trainers were purchased by the United States Navy. These N2Y-1 aircraft were equipped with hooks to catch the trapeze on two U.S. Navy airships, the USS Akron and the USS Macon. The N2Y-1 parasite aircraft were used to train pilots that would subsequently fly the longer distance single- seat F9C Sparrowhawks reconnaissance aircraft. The two-seater N2Y-1 also acted as service aircraft, flying passengers to the inroute airships. On July 6, 1930, future air racer and movie stunt pilot Paul Mantz flew a Fleet Model 2 biplane through 46 consecutive outside loops, an international record which stood for almost 50 years. United States manufacturing rights were eventually sold to Brewster Aeronautical Corporation, which intended to produce the Brewster B-1 based on the Canadian Model 16F.

His global fight against leprosy and its accompanying stigma and social discrimination is an issue to which he has remained highly committed for more than 40 years. As chairman of The Nippon Foundation, Japan's largest charitable foundation, he is seen as a pioneer in guiding public-interest activities by the private in modern Japan. Sasakawa received his degree from Meiji University‚Äôs School of Political Science and Economics. Sasakawa's father was businessman, politician, and philanthropist Ry≈çichi Sasakawa.  Overview of activities  After serving as chairman of the Japan Motorboat Racing Association, and as a director of the Japan Foundation for Shipbuilding Advancement (now the Ocean Policy Research Foundation), Yohei Sasakawa was named president of the Nippon Foundation in 1989. In July 2005, he was appointed chairman, following the retirement of Ayako Sono, the previous chair. Known as a social entrepreneur with insight into a wide range of issues, Sasakawa is internationally recognized for his proactive planning and leadership on a global scale. Key projects include: * Medical examinations for 200,000 children victimized by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident; * Establishment of a system through which users would pay for the support of safe navigation through the Strait of Malacca; * Development of the next generation of leaders through a global scholarship network of 69 universities; * Establishment of a program to bring 2,000 Chinese doctors to Japan for training, and; * Development of Arctic Sea lanes that are usable year-round. His international aid activities have focused on three areas essential to life: food security, healthcare and education. His aid activities within Japan have focused on areas not addressed by government policies, including the development of the nation's nongovernmental organizations and volunteer activities, the enhancement of services for senior citizens and those with disabilities, and the donation of 20,000 care vehicles to social-welfare organizations throughout Japan. Both within Japan and around the world, Sasakawa works on the front lines of humanitarian aid, believing that effective support for public interest activities demands not only funding, but personal commitment and participation. Sasakawa has continually stressed that modern problems demand collaborative solutions, and has built wide-ranging networks encompassing the political, governmental, academic, and private sectors. One such example is Forum 2000, which he has overseen with former Czech President V√°clav Havel for 11 years. This initiative brings together experts and distinguished individuals from around the world to discuss global issues, and has generated a number of innovative programs as a result of their interaction. His domestic work also transverses a wide number of areas, including the development of measures to combat maritime piracy, the publicizing of the operation of North Korean spy ships, the training of hospice nurses, and the building of networks to support crime victims. Sasakawa is also known for his efforts to ensure passage of Japan's Basic Ocean Law in 2007, and his central role in organizing the Tokyo Marathon. Through his focus on cooperation, he has been able to achieve goals that would not have been possible working single-handedly. = Leprosy elimination = Yohei Sasakawa sees leprosy elimination as a personal mission, inherited from his father, Ryoichi Sasakawa. In 1965, he accompanied his father to a leprosy treatment facility in South Korea, and the shock at seeing, first-hand, the discrimination faced by people affected by leprosy, convinced him of the need for leprosy control, leading him to conduct own activities. Sasakawa works to advance dialog between people affected by leprosy, government leaders, the media, and other parties in many countries, with a particular focus on places where the disease is endemic. He focuses a special amount of effort on promoting an accurate understanding of the disease: particularly the fact that it is curable and as part of this drive, he has served as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination since May 2001. In the 1990s, Sasakawa worked to promote the distribution of multidrug therapy (MDT) as a means of controlling leprosy. However, realizing that people affected by leprosy, and even their families, continue to face discrimination in areas such as employment and education even after they have been cured, he has advocated that leprosy be approached not simply as a medical issue but as a social one involving human-rights concerns. In July 2003, he visited the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, seeking to bring the issue before the United Nations Human Rights Committee (now the United Nations Human Rights Council). Subsequently, in March 2004, he raised the matter at a plenary session of the Commission. As a result, in August 2004, the Sub- Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights initiated studies to formally address leprosy and its related discrimination issues as a human- rights issue, eventually unanimously approving a resolution calling on national governments, leprosy-related organizations and UN institutions to improve the current state of affairs. Since then, Sasakawa has continued to work to resolve leprosy's social aspects, for example establishing the Sasakawa-India Leprosy Foundation in 2006 to assist the independence of people affected by the disease. Sasakawa's international achievements in controlling leprosy have resulted in a number of international prizes, such as the Yomiuri Shimbun‚Äôs Yomiuri International Cooperation Prize (2004), and India's International Gandhi Award (2007). Most recently, the Japanese foreign ministry appointed him as its Ambassador for the Human Rights of People Affected by Leprosy. = Maritime affairs = Today, Sasakawa is also active in the very different field of maritime issues. He has proposed the establishment of a new fund through which users would voluntarily contribute to the costs involved in securing maritime safety in the Strait of Malacca, one of the world's busiest sea lanes. By explaining the need for this, in light of today's international conditions, he advances activities intended to overturn the traditional idea that use of all sea-routes should be free of charge. In addition, he is advancing new initiatives to address maritime issues in Japan, including the establishment of the nation's first Basic Ocean Law, working to change the Japanese paradigm that it is a country protected by the sea, to one that protects the seas. Beyond the shores of Japan and the wider region, Sasakawa also established in 2004 the United Nations ‚Äì Nippon Foundation Fellowship Programme to contribute to the building of a new generation of ocean leaders and professionals. Advocating for the importance of information disclosure by public-interest groups, Sasakawa maintains a daily blog (in Japanese) of his activities and thoughts. Under Sasakawa's leadership, The Nippon Foundation's disclosure efforts have won high marks amid government reforms of the public interest field. In addition to creating a website (CANPAN CSR Plus) that helps businesses to participate directly in social-welfare activities, fulfilling their corporate social responsibility (CSR), Sasakawa advocates for work toward a society based on an integration of national and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and corporate CSR efforts. The aim is a society where all members participate in creating the common good.  Major achievements at the Nippon Foundation  2018 *Announced the launch of the CHANGE FOR THE BLUE project as a new, large-scale, nationwide initiative bringing together multiple stakeholders including private-sector entities, the government, and academic institutions to find and implement practical programs to address the problem of marine debris. *Launched the 13th Global Appeal to end stigma and discrimination against persons affected by leprosy, endorsed by Disabled Peoples‚Äô International, from New Delhi, India.

Wellman and starring Barbara Stanwyck. The screenplay by J. Grubb Alexander and Robert Lord is based on the 1924 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, by Edna Ferber. So Big was the second full-scale screen adaptation of the Ferber novel. The first was a 1924 silent film of the same name directed by Charles Brabin and starring Colleen Moore. A 1953 remake was directed by Robert Wise and starred Jane Wyman. The story was also made as a short in 1930, with Helen Jerome Eddy. Plot Following the death of her mother, Selina Peake and her father, Simeon, move to Chicago, where she enrolls in finishing school. Her father is killed, leaving her penniless, and Selina's friend, Julie Hemple, helps her find a job as a schoolteacher in a small Dutch community. Selina moves in with the Poole family and tutors their son Roelf. Selina eventually marries immigrant farmer, Pervus De Jong, and gives birth to Dirk, nicknamed \\"So Big\\", who becomes the primary focus of her life. When Pervus dies, Selina struggles to keep the farm afloat so she can afford to finance her son's education, hoping he will become an architect. Dirk becomes involved with a married woman, who arranges for him to get a job as a bond salesman in her husband's firm, making much more money than as an apprentice architect. Eventually he meets and falls in love with unconventional artist Dallas O'Mara, but she refuses to marry him because of his lack of ambition. Roelf, now a renowned sculptor, meets Dirk and, learning Selina is his mother, reunites with his former tutor. She is pleased to know her influence helped mold Roelf's character, even as she accepts her own son's weaknesses and disappointments. Cast Published by Screenland Magazine, Inc.

Following The Man Who Played God, it was her second film for Warner Bros., and the first in which she appeared with George Brent, who co-starred with her in eleven more films. Davis considered her casting in a prestigious Barbara Stanwyck project a sign Jack L. Warner was acknowledging her value to the studio. In her 1962 autobiography A Lonely Life, she recalled, \\"It was a source of tremendous satisfaction, and encouraged me to unheard-of dreams of glory.\\". *Barbara Stanwyck, a rising star, was brought to even bigger fame with the release of So Big!. A year after her role in So Big!, she starred in Baby Face (1933) and The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933). Her role as Stella Dallas in the 1936 eponymous film was Academy-award nominated largely due to the role she perfected as a mother in So Big!.Smyth, J. E. Edna Ferber's Hollywood. University Of Texas Press, 2011. Production After Cimarron became the top grossing film of 1931 and won multiple Academy Awards, a newfound interest was spurred in American historical cinema- particularly that of Ferber's. Considered \\"box-office material\\", Warner Bros. decided to remake So Big into a talking cinema, paying Ferber an additional $20,000 for sound rights.Jacob Wilk to Morris Ebenstrin, 20 November 1931, series 1.7, box 65, folder A355, United Artists Collection. Despite Hollywood still recovering from its worst year in the Depression, the film underwent production in 1932 with an estimated budget of $228,000 and a solid cast, including well-known actress Barbara Stanwyck. The credit title was shared between Ferber, who was given director approval, and Wellman as the creator of So Big!. The film was shot from January 11 to February 3, finished in just under a month. This film distinguished itself from the 1924 adaption starring Colleen Moore because screenwriters J. Grubb Alexander and Robert Lord maintained Ferber's theme of art versus materialism. A prevailing issue in 1932, the hardship farmers faced as a result of the crashing stock market, was accurately portrayed by the film, garnering the support of the public. This, alongside a new wave of American historical films (Abraham Lincoln, 1930; Cimarron, 1931; Silver Dollar, 1932) and Ferber's popularity, made the movie a success. Critical reception Andre Sennwald of The New York Times called the film \\"a faithful and methodical treatment of Miss Ferber's novel, but without fire or drama or the vitality of the original.\\" He added, \\"A fine actress, Miss Stanwyck seems ill-suited to a role that hustles her in jerky steps from girlhood to old age; a role in which she is asked to express rugged grandeur and the beauty of a life well-lived from behind a mask of grease paint ... Little Dickie Moore is delightful as the younger So Big. Bette Davis ... is unusually competent.\\"Senwald, Andre. \\"So Big (1932): An Edna Ferber Novel\\" The New York Times (April 30, 1932) Variety noted, \\"\\"Wellman's endeavor at kaleidoscopic flashes in the life of Selina Dejong ... make for a choppy continuity ... As it is, the 83 minutes are overly long, but in toto, it's a disjointed affair.\\"Landazuri, Margarita. \\"So Big! (1932)\\" TCM.com The New Yorker considered Barbara Stanwyck's performance \\"the best work she has yet shown us\\", while the New York Daily Mirror called her \\"exquisite\\" and added, \\"Her great talent as an actress never has been demonstrated more brilliantly. A sparkling performance. She is magnificent.\\" Critics of the Motion Picture Herald commented, \\"Warner has remade Edna Ferber's So Big for the talking screen with Barbara Stanwyck in the virile part of a typical American mother whose simple life epic is the backbone of America's greatness... The Ferber classic should not disappoint those who enjoyed the silent version...\\" The film was regarded not only for its great cast and detailed adaptation of the novel, but its unusual plot line for Hollywood movies typical of that time. Commentators praised the film for its \\"characterization...revelation of plain folk doing the things they think, striving always toward a goal of useful citizenship...It goes back to the days when farm life was drudgery, but it brings it up to the day of the tractor, the radio, the automobile, paved highways and so many other conveniences which have radically altered rural life.\\"review in the Motion Picture Herald, 19 March 1932.

Employed as an agent in the fur trade under John Jacob Astor, Hunt organized and led the greater part of a group of about 60 men on an overland expedition to establish a fur trading outpost at the mouth of the Columbia river.Mountain Men: Explorers and Guides The Astorians, as they have become known, were the first major party to cross to the Pacific after the Lewis and Clark expedition. Historical records refer to Hunt both as \\"William\\"Heritage & History of Sublette County, Wyoming and as \\"Wilson.\\"Wilson Price HuntFur Trade Explorers Originally from Trenton, New Jersey, Hunt moved to St. Louis in 1804 and worked selling various merchandise for several years. In 1810 he became connected with John Jacob Astor. Astor, as part of his plan to gain a foothold on the Northwest coast and enable the development and prosecution of a more profitable trade with the Chinese, formed the Pacific Fur Company. The six partners in the Company (not including Astor) were all Canadians and former prominent figures in the North West Company, except for Hunt who was the sole American. Hunt was second in line behind Astor as ‚Äúpartner and first resident agent‚Äù, acting as his personal representative in his absence. The company sent two simultaneous expeditions: one by sea directly to the mouth of the Columbia to establish the post, and one over the land in order to demonstrate the practicability of the route as a supply line. Hunt was placed in charge of the overland expedition and as was to assume charge at Astoria upon his arrival. Hunt had never before traveled into the interior of the west but had been engaged in the Indian trade second hand while at St. Louis supplying traders with goods and equipment. Donald McKenzie, also a partner in the company, accompanied Hunt. McKenzie had extensive wilderness experience, having served ten years in the interior as a clerk for the Northwest Company. ‚ÄúUnder‚Ä¶ two such leaders as Hunt and McKenzie, he [Astor] had, in fact, everything to hope and little to fear‚Äù. On July 5, 1810, Hunt and McKenzie set out for St. Louis from Montreal with a number of Canadian voyageurs. En route, they continued to recruit men for the expedition. Hunt had difficulty finding quality men at Mackinaw and St. Louis. At Mackinaw, he was discouraged by the quality of the men, finding most to be \\"drinking in the morning, drunk at noon and dead drunk at night.\\" In addition, he faced a steady competition for recruits amongst the more established Northwest and Mackinaw companies in Michilimackinac and the Missouri Fur Company in St. Louis. Having finally assembled a party, Hunt arrived at Nodaway, Missouri, on November 16, 1810, and settled into winter quarters. They departed April 22, 1811. In the course of traveling up the Missouri River, Hunt recruited several former Missouri Fur Company men returning from the interior. His original plan had been to ascend the Missouri and then the Yellowstone rivers, but information provided by these men regarding the hostility of the Blackfoot on the upper Missouri caused him to change course and cross to the Columbia by land. Hunt purchased horses from the Arikara tribe near present-day Pierre, South Dakota and began the long trek over land westward. The party passed along the borders of the Black Hills and Bighorn mountains then crossed the Wind River mountains into the valley of the Green River by way of Union Pass. Here they descended the Hoback River to its junction with the Snake River and crossed Teton Pass to the abandoned Fort Henry, arriving October 18, 1811. Knowing that they were now on the headwaters of the Columbia, the party anticipated the majority of their struggles to be over, and Hunt yielded to the desires of his men to abandon the horses and embark downstream by canoe. This was a fateful decision as the course of the Snake River later proved to be completely unnavigable by canoe, forcing the party to travel by foot and causing the men to endure severe hardship. After nine days of attempting to travel the river, they lost a man and two canoes in the rapids and reconsidered their plan. Embarking on foot, they divided into four parties and took different routes to approach the mouth of the Columbia. Hunt's party arrived on February 15, 1812. The trip from Missouri to the future site of Astoria, Oregon took 340 days. According to his own account, Hunt traveled from the village of the Arikaras, in present-day South Dakota, to the end of the journey.Introduction to Hunt's Journal A return expedition overland was led by Robert Stuart, who discovered South Pass, a key feature of the soon-to-be-established Oregon Trail. On August 4, 1812, Hunt sailed on the newly arrived ship sent by Astor, the Beaver, in order to establish trade with the Russian establishment at New Archangel in modern day Alaska, leaving Duncan McDougall in charge of the fort. Hunt remained absent from Astoria longer than intended, forced to wait for payment at New Archangel and then detouring to the Hawaiian Islands to repair damage to the Beaver sustained in a storm. While in the Hawaiian Islands, he learned of the war that had broken out between the US and Britain and chartered the ship Albatros to land him at Astoria. In the meantime, McDougal, faced with managing the precarious situation of Astoria, concluded an agreement to sell the fort to the Northwest Company. Upon his return to Astoria, Hunt was displeased with the decision and questioned the motives of the Canadian partners, but despite his protest he was bound to their decision. Soon after arriving, he again left the fort, this time on the Albatros bound for the Marquesas and the Hawaiian Islands for the purposes of bringing a large quantity of the furs accumulated at Astoria to market, acquiring a ship and a load of provisions, and returning home the Hawaiian Islanders who were in the employ of the Company at Astoria. While in the Hawaiian Islands, Hunt purchased the brig the Pedlar, which he provisioned and sailed to Astoria in order to conduct business related to the transfer of the fort to the British. The Pedlar then traveled again to New Archangel and then to Kamchatka before being captured in August 1814 by the Spanish on smuggling charges and held on the coast of California at San Louis Obispo for 2 months. After being released, the Pedlar made its way back to the Hawaiian Islands then ultimately onto China to procure a cargo of Chinese goods for trade in New York. Hunt arrived in New York with his cargo in October 1816. Hunt ultimately returned to St. Louis in 1817 and purchased a large tract of land southwest of the city, upon which he farmed and made improvements until his death in 1842. He was appointed postmaster of St. Louis in 1822 by President Monroe and held the position until 1840. Hunt's expedition is one of many scenes depicted on the Astoria Column, and his name is inscribed in a frieze in the Oregon State Senate chamber of the Oregon State Capitol.

In 1838, Jock Winter named the area \\"Bonshaw\\".http://www.ballaratgenealogy.org.au/sebastopol/golden_c/tline.htm In 1855, it was renamed after Sevastopol in Crimea. Sebastopol's origin were a separate working class town servicing the rich gold mining fields south of Ballarat. Albert Street Sebastopol in 1866 The Post Office opened on 5 October 1857. Sebastopol Town Hall was opened on 19 March 1869. On August 14, 1913 the tramway to Ballarat opened which led to it becoming by the mid 20th century part of the Ballarat urban area. Education Sebastopol is served by a joint primary and secondary school, Phoenix College, several kindergartens, a post office and library, and several small shopping precincts including three supermarkets. Transport Buses have operated in Sebastopol since 21 September 1971 after they replaced the tram service. Ballarat Transit now provides regular bus services between Ballarat CBD and Sebastopol. Community Sebastopol is home to The Complex Recreation Centre, most commonly known as \\"The Complex\\". The building was built in 1961 and is rich in history, but has only recently transformed into a second home for Ballarat's troubled youths. Sport Sebastopol has an Australian rules football team competing in the Ballarat Football League. The Sebastopol Vikings play association football/soccer in the Ballarat & District Soccer Association.

Building, is a high-rise building on Public Square in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The building was constructed in 1889, and stood as the tallest building in Cleveland until 1896, when it was surpassed by the 221-foot (67 m) Guardian Bank Building. The building stands 152 feet (46 m) tall, with 10 floors. The Society for Savings Building is often considered to be the first modern skyscraper in Cleveland and the state of Ohio. It was designed by John Wellborn Root of the Chicago-based architectural firm Burnham & Root. Design The Society for Savings Building was designed with a combination of Gothic, Romanesque, and Renaissance architectural styles. It contains elements of each in its granite pillars, arched window frames and red sandstone facade. History The Society for Savings Building in 1910 The Society for Savings Building in 1965 The Society for Savings Building was constructed to serve as office space for Cleveland's Society for Savings. Though structurally complete in late 1889, the building did not officially open until June 23, 1890. The building was at the time dubbed \\"Ohio's skyscraper\\" by locals, as it was the first modern high-rise building to be constructed in the city and the state. It went on to serve as the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, or BLE, from 1896 until 1910. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1976. In modern times, the building is one of several structures located at Key Center. Key Tower (formerly known as the Society Center), the tallest building in Cleveland and in the state of Ohio, was built adjacent to the Society for Savings Building by Society Bank 100 years after it; the lobbies of the two buildings were integrated, and in the process the Society for Savings Building underwent an extensive restoration and renovation project headed by the architectural firm of van Dijk, Pace, Westlake & Partners. The building contains 147,089 square feet (13,665 m¬≤) of office space.

A pantun is intended to be recited during an evening-length performance during which a single performer relates the story of a hero's initiation: The protagonist leaves his kingdom in order to seek experiences, beautiful princesses to become his wife, power, other kingdoms to subject, the realization of a dream (Rosidi 1984a:143); after having succeeded in reaching his goal he finally returns to his kingdom. Alongside descriptions of historical events, the stories often contain mythical elements. Pantun were originally not written down, the bards often being illiterate and in many cases blind. Originally the performances had a sacred character, as was clear from the offerings made at the beginning of the recitation and also from the content of the introductory part of the story, called rajah, which was an invocatory song, imploring the help of divine figures to ward off bad influences. The linguistic form of the pantun was not strictly fixed, however the dominant form employed in most pantun is the octosyllabic verse. For a detailed description of the nature and form of a Sundanese pantun you are referred to Eringa (1949), to Hermansoemantri (1977‚Äì79). Currently there are few Pantun Sunda shows performed, due to a decline in popularity of the form following the widespread introduction of radio and television in households throughout West Java.Sunda Transcription of pantun stories Pantun, being oral texts, were not written down in the Sundanese literary tradition; only late in the nineteenth century were the first pantun put down in writing (in the beginning usually in cacarakan script) at the instigation of Western (Dutch) enthusiasts. After the establishment of Indonesia, Sundanese scholars made important contributions to the study of pantun, by publishing more oral texts as well as by critically investigating them. Special mention should be made of a project by Ajip Rosidi who in the early seventies had a considerable number of pantun recorded as they were performed by singers from various areas in West Java (see Rosidi 1973). The recorded pantun was transcribed and in stenciled form circulated in limited circle. Later on a number of them were published in book form, such as Mundinglaya di Kusumah (1986). An excellent study of the literally structure of the pantun was written by Hermansoemantri (1977‚Äì79); Kartini et al. (1984) wrote a useful comparative analysis on the plot of the pantun, based on a survey of 35 pantun stories. A valuable work on the musical aspects of pantun performances, based on extensive data collected in the field, was written by A. N. Weintraub (1990). In the Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian, dated 1518, pantun are mentioned: \\"hayang nyaho di pantun ma: Langgalarang, Banyakcatra, Siliwangi, Haturwangi, prepantun tanya\\" (if you want to know pantun, such as Langgalarang, Banyakcatra, siliwangi, Haturwangi, ask the pantun singer, Atja and Danasasmita 1981a:14). Throughout the ages many ancient elements have been preserved, even though the content of the stories told and the language used underwent changes and adaptations. Not only are there a number of Arabic words present in many pantun texts, which in pre-Islamic Old Sundanese text are lacking; the repertoire of present-day pantun singers include Islamic tales as is clear from the list in Weintraub (1990:23-4). List of pantun stories Based on Budi Rahayu Tamsyah in his book Kamus Istilah Tata Basa jeung Sastra Sunda, there are pantun stories as follows: #Ciung Wanara #Lutung Kasarung #Mundinglaya di Kusumah #Aria Munding Jamparing #Banyakcatra #Badak Sangorah #Badak Singa #Bima Manggala #Bima Wayang #Budak Manjor #Budug Basu /Sri Sadana / Sulanjana #Bujang Pangalasan #Burung Baok #Buyut Orenyeng #Dalima Wayang #Demung Kalagan #Deugdeug Pati Jaya Perang / Raden Deugdeug Pati Jaya Perang Prabu Sandap Pakuan #Gajah Lumantung #Gantangan Wangi #Hatur Wangi #Jaka Susuruh #Jalu Mantang #Jaya Mangkurat #Kembang Panyarikan / Pangeran Ratu Kembang Panyarikan #Kidang Panandri #Kidang Pananjung #Kuda Gandar #Kuda Lalean #Kuda Malela #Kuda Wangi #Langla Larang #Langga Sari #Langon Sari #Layung Kumendung #Liman Jaya Mantri #Lutung Leutik / Ratu Bungsu Karma Jaya #Malang Sari #Manggung Kusuma #Matang Jaya #Munding Jalingan #Munding Kawangi #Munding Kawati #Munding Liman #Munding Mintra #Munding Sari Jaya Mantri #Munding Wangi #Nyi Sumur Bandung #Paksi Keling / Wentang Gading #Panambang Sari #Panggung Karaton #Parenggong Jaya #Raden Mangprang di Kusumah #Raden Tanjung #Raden Tegal #Rangga Sawung Galing #Rangga Gading #Rangga Katimpal #Rangga Malela #Rangga Sena #Ratu Ayu #Ratu Pakuan #Ringgit Sari #Senjaya Guru #Siliwangi  References  Category:Music of West Java Category:Sundanese literature Category:Sundanese music ","title":"Pantun Sunda"},{"id":"14900016","text":"Ringgold's location according to a 1914 atlas Ringgold is an unincorporated community in McPherson County, Nebraska, United States.

The movement was led through the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association (CICA or Indusco) founded in 1938. Its international arm the International Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives (ICCIC, also known by the nickname Gung Ho International Committee) was founded in 1939 in Hong Kong to promote cooperatives in China. The movement was especially active in the 1930s and 1940s with support from both left and right wings of Chinese politics. The movement disappeared after the 1950s due to suppression by the People's Republic of China government, but CICA and ICCIC were revived in the 1980s and are still active today. In the English-speaking world, the industrial cooperatives‚Äô best known legacy is their nickname () which is thought to have led to the term \\"gung-ho\\". History The Gung Ho () movement was first initiated in Shanghai in 1937. Some of the principal organizers were Rewi Alley of New Zealand, Edgar Snow, Nym Wales (Helen Foster Snow), and Ida Pruitt of the USA, as well as a group of Chinese including Hu Yuzhi (ËÉ°ÊÑà‰πã) and Sha Qianli (Ê≤ôÂçÉÈáå). In August 1938, the CICA was established. It was founded in the wartime capital Hankow when China was engaged in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Through the sponsorship of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Finance Minister Dr. H. H. Kung supplied government financial support. The movement aimed to organize unemployed workers and refugees, increasing production to support the war effort. The goal was to replace industrial capacity lost to bombing by dispersing and giving workers voting shares in their CICs. The CICA organized small scale self-supporting cooperatives, mainly in rural areas, to create employment for workers and refugees and produce goods for the war effort.Anne-Marie Brady, Friend of China: The Myth of Rewi Alley (London; New York: Routledge Curzon, 2002, ): 30-31. In January 1939, the international arm ICCIC was established in Hong Kong. Ms. Soong Ching-ling was elected honorary chair and the Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong, the Right Rev. Ronald O. Hall to be chair, and Dr. Chen Hansheng was appointed as secretary general. Rev. Dr. Walter Brooks Foley, pastor of Union Church of Manila, Philippines, serve on the international committee, along with leading Chinese businessmen in Manila Dee C. Chuan, Alfonso Sycip, and Yu Khe thai. Foley became president of the Philippine Association of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. In 1941, the Gung Ho movement reached its peak: around 3,000 cooperatives with a combined membership of nearly 300,000 people were functioning. Their factories produced more than 500 products for the local people, and a large number of blankets, uniforms and other army supplies for the battlefront. Ida Pruitt toured the United States to raise substantial financial support. The unique role of Gung Ho cooperatives in the war also won such international acclaim that the term \\"gung-ho\\" became a famous slogan of the U.S. Marine Corps. Adopting the literal meanings of the two characters separately as \\"work\\" and \\"together\\", the slogan entered the English language as a term denoting whole-hearted dedication to a meaningful cause. Both the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist movement of Mao Zedong supported the movement and tried to control it. Alley placated the Nationalists but his sympathies and eventual loyalties were to the emerging Communist government. In 1942, Alley was dismissed from Gung Ho by the government of Chiang Kai-shek. After Mao‚Äôs victory in 1949 Alley stayed in China, but there was no need for the CICA and ICCIC. Both CICA and ICCIC suspended their works in 1952. An excellent discussion of the CICs appears in Graham Peck's book Two Kinds of Time (1950). Peck traveled with Alley to a number of CICs early in 1941 and was able to see them at their height, but as his experience grew he came to understand their limitations and the fact that their course was ultimately downwards, not upwards, for a variety of reasons. Revival The CICA was revived in 1983, and the ICCIC was revived in 1987 in Beijing by Alley and other former Gung Ho leaders. The reorganized ICCIC registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs of People's Republic of China as an international non-profit organization. Zhu Xuefan (Êú±Â≠∏ÁØÑ) was elected as honorary chair and Alley as chair. The main task of the revived ICCIC is the promotion of cooperatives in China. Membership is open to all individuals and organizations who support the cooperative movement. The committee has approximately 100 members from China, Australia, Germany, Belgium, France, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Hong Kong. The ICCIC‚Äôs General Assembly of all members meets every five years. The Executive Board elected by the Assembly is responsible for decision-making on major issues according to its articles of association during the adjournment of the Assembly. A secretariat is set up to handle day-to-day work.

Middle Ages Fresco in Oberhofen Church, G√∂ppingen, c. 1470 Hohenstaufen castle was built about 1070 by Frederick I of Hohenstaufen‚Äîeven before he became Duke of Swabia‚Äî, as a fortress to protect family interests in the vicinity. Until the 13th century, the castle was a possession of the imperial and royal family, the Hohenstaufen dynasty. In 1181, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa stayed there; in 1208, Irene Angelina, the widow of Barbarossa's son, the recently murdered Philip of Swabia, died at Hohenstaufen Castle. After the fall of the Hohenstaufen in 1268, the castle was declared an imperial possession by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany. The strategically and symbolically important location was a constant bone of contention between the Counts of W√ºrttemberg and the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1372, Hohenstaufen Castle finally was in the hands of the W√ºrttemberg rulers. After the expulsion of Duke Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg by the members of the Swabian League in 1519, one Georg Staufer of Blo√üenstaufen successfully claimed the castle, as a descendant of the old Hohenstaufen dynasty. Therefore, only a small force defended the castle in 1525, when it was taken and destroyed by the peasants during the German Peasants' War. Stones from the castle were later used in the construction of the Renaissance G√∂ppingen Castle. Modern times Since the German unification of 1871, Hohenstaufen Castle has been regarded as a national monument. The archaeologist Walther Veeck undertook excavations on it between 1936 and 1938, and further excavations were made between 1967 and 1971, uncovering and securing the castle foundations. A Hohenstaufen memorial stele (Stauferstele) was inaugurated in 2002. In 2009 additional work was done to preserve the site. It is also worth mentioning that in the beginning of 19439th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen#Formation and Eastern Front, the 9th Armored SS division received its title \\"Hohenstaufen\\" - due to the fact that most Waffen-SS divisions and regiments had their official titles based on renowned people, places or media with roots in Germanic history.5th SS Panzer Division Wiking38th SS Division Nibelungen22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresia The Staufer Museum, located at the intersection of Pfarrgasse and Kaiserbergsteige in Hohenstaufen, contains artifacts from and historical information about the site. The trail that leads to the castle site starts between the two churches that are adjacent to the Staufer Museum.

During World War II, Princess Maria and her uncle Holman, exiles from their (unnamed) conquered European country, live in New York City.

While flying to California incognito as \\"Mary Williams\\", the princess‚Äîfearful of flying‚Äîis accidentally given too many sleeping pills. When the Douglas DST airliner returns to New York because of bad weather, the crew cannot wake her. The pilot, Eddie O'Rourke, takes care of her, still unaware who she is. She wakes up the next morning in his apartment wearing his pajamas. To explain her absence, Maria tells her uncle that she slept at the airport. She spends the day with Eddie, his friend and co-pilot, Dave Campbell, and Dave's wife Jean (who had put Maria to bed). \\"Mary\\" tells them she is a war refugee and was traveling to California to work as an upstairs maid. She and Eddie quickly fall in love. With both Eddie and Dave about to join the United States Army Air Forces, Eddie impulsively proposes to Mary. She accepts, but sadly believes that, as a princess, she cannot marry him. A Secret Service agent assigned to protect Maria tells her uncle of the relationship. Holman is not opposed to Maria marrying a commoner, and is pleased to learn that Eddie is one of nine brothers and his father one of 11. Holman also knows that his niece marrying an American would strengthen his country's vital relationship with the United States. To Maria's surprise and joy, he permits the marriage, and Eddie is stunned to learn that his poor European refugee is actually royalty. President Franklin D. Roosevelt invites Maria and Eddie to stay at the White House. Given a crash course in royal protocol by a representative of the State Department, Eddie becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the conditions attached to the role of prince consort and being financially supported by his wife, with no career other than fathering an heir. While discussing the prenuptial agreement, he finally rebels when he is informed he must surrender his American citizenship. After making an impassioned speech about how lucky he is to be an American, Eddie asks \\"Mary\\" to choose between him and her family. Maria obeys her uncle and leaves the room; a disappointed Eddie calls her a \\"slave\\". Holman locks her in the Lincoln Bedroom. After much crying, Maria writes a note and slips it under the door for Roosevelt's dog, Fala, to deliver to his master.

The series follows a group of sentient, prehistoric large cats called the Named, led by the female cat, Ratha. It also deals with their struggles against the group of non-sentient cats, the Unnamed. On October 18, 2007, it was reprinted by the company Penguin Group. Ratha, who gave birth to five cubs in the first book, Ratha's Creature, had a non-sentient cub who she named Thistle-chaser with her UnNamed mate, Bonechewer. Ratha, in a fit of anger with Bonechewer, bit her daughter when she got in the way of her and Bonechewer's fight. This causes Thistle-chaser damage that, due to the lack of therapy, caused one of her legs to shrivel and becomes useless over time. Bonechewer is furious with her for harming their daughter and chases her away, which causes Ratha to reunite with her clan. After Bonechewer is killed in a raid, Ratha has no clue as to where her offspring went. Plot Thistle-chaser, the daughter of the Named clan leader, Ratha, has no recollection of her past or true name. Due to this, she lives alone on a coastline, befriending the seamares that reside there, and goes by 'Newt'. In her dreams, a creature she knows as the Dreambiter, which bites her foreleg, often makes her go into seizures and fits of panic. A clan cat, Thakur comes across Thistle-chaser while searching for water. He befriends her and starts having her swim in a lagoon which acts as therapy for her shriveled leg. When he reports of the water and seamares that live there, Ratha decides to move the clan and their livestock to the coast, going as far as to capture the seamares. Thistle-chaser is upset by this and frees them, making Ratha, who refuses to believe that Thistle-chaser is her daughter, order the clan to attack Thistle-chaser if she tries anything like it again. Thistle-chaser eventually learns that Ratha is her mother and realizes that the Dreambiter would be destroyed if Ratha was killed. Ratha bit Thistle- chaser when she was young, which was the cause of the Dreambiter. Thistle- chaser decides to attack Ratha and the two get into a fight. When Ratha gets her foot stuck between two rocks, Mishanti, an Unnamed cub which Ratha was going to abandon, gets caught in the fray and tries to defend Ratha. In her fury, Thistle-chaser goes after him, only to be stopped by Ratha, who calls her names and brings her back to reality. Thakur and Fessran, another clan cat, arrive soon and together with Thistle-chaser bring Ratha and Mishanti to safety. Through these events, Ratha is able to admit that Thistle-chaser is her daughter and Thistle-chaser is able to forgive her mother. Mishanti, being an orphan and lacking any proof that he is sentient, is taken in by Thistle- chaser who will raise him and bring out his hidden sentience. =Terms= The Named are a group of prehistoric sentient large cats; they call themselves a clan and are led by the female Ratha. The clan herds creatures and uses them as livestock, and also have fire, which they call Red Tongue, which they use for heat and protection. They are recognizable by their cleanliness and their eyes, which have a distinct look of knowingness and brightness. They can love and feel for other members of the clan and have morals and their own language. The group has Herders, who keep herd the livestock and protect them, and Firekeepers, who tend to the Red Tongue. The Unnamed are the opposite; non- sentient large cats who live in no distinct group, but band together sometimes for attacks. They are dirty and their eyes are distinct and unaware of what happens. They rely on instinct and have no language. A cat can be born Unnamed, but it is due to related lineage with members of the Named. Unlike the Named, they do not herd animals, but hunt instead. The Unnamed are Sabre Tooth Cats. Red Tongue is fire used by The Named. Seamare is the term used for water creatures with protruding teeth, a horse-like head and neck, and a blubbery body. They have webbed feet, and live in a herd. The Seamare are desmostylians. Media Ratha and Thistle-chaser was originally released in 1990, a sequel to both Ratha's Creature and Clan Ground. Later, it was re- released by Puffin book publishing with new cover art, as the rest of the series was. While Ratha's Creature was made into an animated CBS movie, Ratha and Thistle-chaser, like its prequel and sequels, was never made into an animated or live-action format.

The Parap Parish Hall between Westralia Street and Charles Street existed in 1949, but was not named until 1954. When Administrator Driver was making the first moves towards local government, local Progress Associations were set up, including Stuart Park in 1950.

Present day Stuart Park is a predominantly residential suburb and is usually associated with other inner Darwin suburbs of Fannie Bay, Ludmilla and Parap.

CSP is a non-profit arts organization with an international membership of print artists and supporters of the art of fine printmaking. CSP promotes professional development and opportunity for printmakers, and educates artists and the public about printmaking. New members are admitted by portfolio review. Friends and supporters of printmaking are admitted by fee. They are based in San Francisco, California.  Early history: American print clubs (printmakers societies) and California Society of Etchers (CSE) Logo 2004-. American print clubs or printmaking societies were prolific in the 19th century. Their impetus was primarily exhibition, technical exchange, shared equipment, and the promotion of printmaking as a fine art, as opposed to a method of reproducing images. The invention of photography meant that reproduction of art works could be achieved photographically instead of through the graphic arts of etching, engraving, and lithography. Thus, these methods of printmaking were freed from their reproducing role to develop as pure fine arts. In addition to the rise of printmaking societies/clubs, individual printmaking artists also sought to distinguish their work as a fine art, as opposed to a craft. Generally these artists from the 19th century were referred to as painter-etchers. Nineteenth century printmaking societies in the United States were the New York Etchers Club (1877), Boston Etchers Club (1880?), Philadelphia Society of Etchers (1880), Brooklyn Etchers Club (1881), Brooklyn Scratchers Club (1882), Society of American Etchers (1888), Cincinnati Etchers Club (circa 1890). Early 20th century printmaking societies were the very influential Chicago Society of Etchers (1910), begun and promoted by Bertha Jaques. After the Chicago Society, a flurry of other printmakers' societies followed. Next was the California Society of Etchers (1912), the Los Angeles group called the Printmakers of California (1914), and the Brooklyn Society of Etchers (1915). The California Society of Etchers (CSE) merged with Bay Printmakers Society in 1968 when the current name, California Society of Printmakers (CSP), was adopted. Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s short histories of the society penned by various elected officers always referred to CSE/CSP as \\" the second oldest\\" continuous operating club in the United States. However, these historians failed to mention what the oldest society was. A little research revealed that the oldest American society of printmakers was the Chicago Society of Etchers. The California Society of Etchers was very aware of its Chicago predecessor, as the Chicago founder Bertha Jaques encouraged printmakers to establish their own local societies. Jaques also joined the California Society of Etchers in 1913, when non-resident members were first admitted.Millman, Mary and Dave Bohn, Master of Line: John W. Winker, American Etcher (Capra Press: Santa Barbara, 1994), p. 31, note 15. The Chicago Society of Etchers ceased operations in 1956, leaving California Society of Printmakers as the longest lived printmakers' society in the U.S.  Origins of the California Society of Etchers (CSE) The California Society of Etchers (CSE) was founded in San Francisco in December 1912 and announced in the San Francisco Chronicle on January 19, 1913 (\\"Etchers Form a State Organization\\", p. 27). Several sources cite an earlier 1911 date, such Marilyn S. Kushner's detailed chapter, \\"Genesis of the Twentieth-Century Print Club\\", although she does not cite her source. Robert B. Harshe, founder, and later first president of California Society of Etchers, leaves the founding date ambiguous in his chapter in the 1916 book, Art in California. His chapter mentions the four years of the society, although the chapter itself is undated. Mary Millman and Dave Bohn's very thorough biography of John W. Winkler, cited above, supports the CSE founding date of 1912. The founding of CSE is intimately connected with the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (PPIE), a world's fair held in 1915 in San Francisco to showcase the city's recovery from the 1906 earthquake. It was Joseph Pennell, scheduled to be a juror for this event, who inspired a handful of local printmakers to launch the California Society of Etchers in preparation for that great event. Pennell, perhaps the best known American etcher, local to New York City and London, had traveled to Panama to sketch the construction of the Canal, then traveled to San Francisco where he produced a series of etchings of San Francisco, exhibiting them in 1912 in San Francisco. It is said that his presence in San Francisco achieved its purpose: encouraging local printmakers to get prepared and organized to take advantage of the promotional opportunities afforded by the upcoming San Francisco PPIE, the largest display of original art work of its time. The four founders of the California Society of Etchers were artist colleagues: Robert B. Harshe (1879‚Äì1938), himself an etcher and then art professor at Stanford University; Pedro Joseph J. Lemos (1882‚Äì1954), then etcher and professor at the San Francisco Institute of Art (now San Francisco Art Institute); Gottardo Piazzoni (1872‚Äì1945), painter and muralist; and Ralph Stackpole (1885‚Äì1973), a sculptor, printmaker, and at that time Piazzoni's studio assistant. The young organization began exhibiting immediately, with its first annual exhibition in April 1913 at Vickery, Atkins and Torrey Print Gallery, 550 Sutter Street, San Francisco. Its second annual exhibition was also held in 1913. Admission of artist members to the Society was originally not by juried portfolio review, as it is today. Then the society was open to all artists, painters and sculptors alike, any artist who had experience with etching techniques. Artist membership was expanded beyond California in 1913 to include artists throughout the United States as well as American printmakers living abroad. It is not clear when precisely CSE began accepting international printmakers, but 1964 was CSE's first major international print competition. The primary purpose of the Society was exhibition and education, promoting printmaking as a fine art, and sharing workspace and equipment. Non-artist members, then as now, were accepted as Associate or Patron members. Membership in both artist and associate categories grew quickly. The four founding members grew to fifteen charter members, those who were members at the time of publication of the first Constitution of the CSE in 1915; among these charter members was Gertrude Partington Albright.Hailey, Gene, ed. \\"Gertrude Partington Albright\\". California Art Research 15 (1937): 31-54. By 1925 there were 41 artist members and 107 associate members. Among the most prominent associate members were the Moore S. Achenbachs, the Sigmund Sterns, Dr. Leon Kolb, the Milton Esbergs, the Zellerbachs, Albert M. Bender, and institutions such as the De Young Museum, Oakland Public Library, and the Print Club of Albany New York.  Mid- Century California Society of Etchers (CSE) had enjoyed a dedicated executive secretary, Nicholas Dunphy (1896‚Äì1955), for more than 20 years, from 1932 to his death in 1955. Understandably, Dunphy's death created a huge hole in CSE's leadership. Nonetheless, annual membership shows continued except for the year of his death, with Elizabeth Ginno (1911‚Äì1991) becoming secretary after Dunphy's death. Ginno, Ginno's husband John W. Winkler, aka Winks (1890‚Äì1979), and Mark Luca (1918‚Äì2005), were active CSE members between 1955 and 1968, the year that CSE merged with Bay Printmakers Society to form California Society of Printmakers (CSP)  Bay Printmakers Society In 1955 two graduate students from Oakland's California College of Arts and Crafts (now the California College of the Arts) were eager for exhibition opportunities. According to Jean Womack, former CSP historian, Mel Strawn (1929‚Äì) and Will Petersen (1928‚Äì1994) placed an ad in a national art magazine announcing themselves as the Bay Printmakers Society hosting a national exhibition. Work was to be sent to the address cited even though a location for the actual show had not yet been established. As the work poured in, Paul Mills, then director of the Oakland Museum of Art, provided the venue, and remained a strong supporter during the next five national exhibitions. The first exhibition was juried by John Paul Jones, respected printmaker from UCLA. The jurying took place at the home of Eldon Mills, friend of Mel Strawn, and an active supporter of Bay Printmakers; it was monitored/observed by Sabro Hasegawa, a visiting teacher from Japan at CCAC. Charter members of the Bay Printmakers Society included artists Beth Van Hoesen (1926‚Äì2010 ), John Ihle (1925‚Äì2002), Karl Kasten (1916‚Äì2010 ), Nathan Oliveira (1928‚Äì2010 ), Gordon Cook (1927‚Äì1985), Virginia Vandegrift, and art collector Eldon Mills. Their activities were focused exclusively on the national show. Between 1955 and 1960, Bay Printmakers generally had one-person juries for their open national shows. After John Paul Jones, BPS jurors were printmaker Leonard Edmondson (1916‚Äì2002); poet Kenneth Patchen (1911‚Äì1972); and Director of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts Ernst Gunter Troche (1909‚Äì1971). Between 1959 and 1965 CSE created three-person jury teams for their national open, juried print exhibitions. These generally consisted of one artist member, one critic, and one museum curator. In 1959 the jurors were Ernest Freed, John Winkler, and John LaPlante. In 1960 the jurors were Doel Reed, E. Gunter Troche, and Raymond E. Lewis. Other CSE national annual jurors were: 1961 Gordon Cook; 1965 Wayne Thiebaud, Alan Lynch, and Moses Lasky.  Merger History: California Society of Etchers Joins Bay Printmakers In 1968 Ginno invited Bay Printmaker member John Ihle to join CSE, probably the first dual member of both organizations. Ginno then approached Bay Printmaker president Karl Kasten, who had help create the etching studios at the new San Francisco State University campus in 1949 and then joined UC Berkeley's art department in printmaking, about the possibility of merging CSE and BPS. Kasten took up the suggestion immediately. Both organizations met at the Oakland Museum in 1968 and approved the merger, electing Kasten as the first president of the new society, which they named California Society of Printmakers. A new constitution was created, and exhibitions, education of members and the public, and publications continued.  CSP Today Today, CSP has approximately 250 artist members, 19 honorary members, and 12 associate and patron memberships. CSP publishes the annual California Printmaker Journal and previously published the semi-annual California Printmaker Newsbrief.  Archives  California Society of Printmakers maintains two separate archives: one of its records, the other of prints. The California Society of Printmakers Records were given to The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley by the California Society of Printmakers in January 1988. Additions were made in 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007. A finding aid to the records may be found at the Online Archive of California. A small archive of prints is maintained by CSP at a San Francisco storage facility. An inventory has not yet been created.

The drama features actor Joseph Rigano and, in neo-realist fashion, an ensemble cast of non-professional actors. The film is also known as: The City (La Ciudad).. The drama consists of four vignettes that plunges you onto New York City's poorer neighborhoods where Latin American immigrants, many of whom barely speak English, live at the mercy of exploitative employers and inflexible institutions. Many of the characters are in the United States illegally to make money in order to send back home to their poor families. The picture won numerous awards including the Organisation Catholique Internationale du Cin√©ma et de l'Audiovisuel (OCIC Award) at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. Plot Among intermittent scenes of Latin Americans having their photo taken by a photographer, the four stories in the picture include: :Bricks (Ladrillos): a group of Latino men wait on a street corner for someone to hire them. A contractor appears in a truck and selects 10 men and promises each $50 for a day of work. But after they are dropped off across the Hudson River in a dusty lot where a building has been demolished, the terms of employment are revised by the contractor. They are to clean up bricks and do it on a piecemeal basis (15 cents a brick). The men are not happy but mush on nevertheless. An accident happens and the men are unable to help the victim and appear helpless in their fate. :Home (Casa): a young man named Francisco newly arrived in New York strays into a \\"sweet 15\\" party and meets a serious young woman named Maria who turns out to be from the same Mexican town. Because he has no place to stay, she takes him home to her uncle's house. The next morning when he goes to buy some groceries for breakfast, he can't find his way back. :The Puppeteer (Titiritero): is a homeless street performer named Luis who is suffering from tuberculosis and lives with his daughter Dulce in an old station wagon. Hearing that every child in the city is guaranteed an education, the puppeteer, who has refused to stay in city shelters because of contagious diseases, attempts to enroll his daughter in school but is unable to prove he lives in New York City. :Seamstress (Costurera): in the final and politically incendiary vignette, a woman named Ana works in a sweatshop where no one has been paid for several weeks. She receives a letter from home with the news that her daughter has fallen ill and needs $400 for an operation. She pleads with her bosses for her back pay but she's threatened with dismissal.

The DVD includes the featurette: The Making of a Community Film. In a DVD review of the DVD, technology critic Gary W. Tooze, wrote, \\"New Yorker have drastically improved their DVD packages in the past few months with strong extra feature additions, but their image quality appears to have plateau'd. This is non- anamorphic and exhibits minor coming in spots (non-progressive) but much of the inferiority of the image is a function of the independent manner in which it was produced...The featurette addition is a super extra and helps further appreciation of this fine film. Even with the weak image we strongly recommend!\\"Tooze, David W. DVD Beaver, review. Last accessed: December 27, 2007. Reception =Critical response= The film critic for The New York Times, Stephen Holden, lauded then film when it was released, and wrote,\\"The City doesn't go out of its way to pull your heartstrings, but its understatement makes it all the more devastating. The anxious, careworn faces of downtrodden people who have no choice but to continue as best they can convey their plight more powerfully than any words. New Yorkers will recognize these faces. There are tens of thousands of them. They're only too glad to do our dirty work.\\"Holden, Stephen. The New York Times, film review, \\"Citizens of Poverty Yearning to Be Free,\\" October 22, 1998. Last accessed: December 27, 2007. Film critic Roger Ebert also liked the film and its message and wrote,\\" [The City is] a direct, spare, touching film developed by Riker during six years of acting workshops with immigrants in New York City...Finally [the film] is making its way around the country, at venues like the Film Center at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. It is a film that would have great power for Spanish-speaking working people, who of course are unlikely to find it at the Film Center. Eventually on television, it may find a broader audience. It gives faces to the faceless and is not easily forgotten.Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun Times, film eview, January 7, 2000. Last accessed: December 27, 2007. Edward Guthmann, the San Francisco Chronicle staff critic, wrote of the film, \\"[The City] is Riker's first film and a lovely realization of his humanist dream. Honest and unvarnished, it succeeds in drawing us inside a world‚Äîthe Latin American immigrant culture of New York‚Äîthat we typically see only from its periphery.\\" Yet, Guthman thought the film was uneven and he added, \\"Seamstress\\" is the strongest vignette in The City, and unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't match its impact. The first piece, \\"Bricks,\\" is slow in starting, and the second, \\"Home,\\" is emotionally flat and can't mask the amateurishness of the leads. The City has its awkward and rough edges, but there's a purity here, a goodness of intention and a commitment to justice.Guthman, Edward. San Francisco Chronicle, film review, February 25, 2000.

It was formerly a state park, and is now the property of the City of Oakland. The Oakland Zoo occupies the developed western lowlands of the park, just off I-580. Creation The park's namesake and principal founder was Joseph Knowland, who served on the California State Park Commission from 1934 to 1960 and was its chairman from 1938. Under his influence, the State of California purchased for $660,000 on a matching grant basis. On April 30 1948, the property became a State Park. In December 1949, the park was leased to the City of Oakland with the proviso that Knowland Park would always remain a public park. At this time, a portion of the park became the new site of the relocated Oakland Zoo. Joseph Knowland was honored, on the 101st California State Admission Day, September 9 1951, by the City of Oakland, Alameda County, and the State of California, with the renaming of the park to Joseph Knowland State Arboretum and Park.Oakland Zoo History In 1973, the site was ceded to the City of Oakland,About Oakland Parks & Recreation and in 1975, management of the park was granted to the City of Oakland.Oakland Zoo History About the park Aerial view of the park with sections of the park labeled The largest and most pristine portion of the park is undeveloped, and yet is the most accessible to park users. The western highlands and northern slopes are currently a thriving hotspot for rare native plants and wildlife. Some of the natural highlights of the park include rare native plant communities, thriving but threatened wildlife, choice bird-watching locales, and a known-critical migratory corridor for mountain lions and bobcats. The park is traversed along its northern boundary by Arroyo Viejo which flows to Lion Creek and then San Leandro Bay. In 2010, the East Bay Chapter of the California Native Plant Society (EBCNPS) included Knowland Park in its South Oakland Botanical Priority Protection Area due to its rich native plant resources that include rare natural communities of Valley Needlegrass Grassland and Maritime Chaparral.Botanical Priority Guide Controversy In 2011, Oakland City Council voted to approve the expansion of the Oakland Zoo into upper Knowland Park. This move has been fiercely contested by the Friends of Knowland Park.East Bay Express City Council Approves Zoo Expansion On December 9, 2014, the Oakland City Council voted to block public access to dozens of acres within the heart of the park by granting a mitigation easement to offset the damage that would occur from a planned development by the Oakland Zoo onto the western highland of Knowland Park. The Save Knowland Park Coalition, which includes the Sierra Club - East Bay Chapter, California Native Plant Society, California Grasslands Association, several other environmental organizations as well as the Green Party are supporting a referendum effort to put the issue to a vote of Oakland registered voters.

Each head is sphere-like, covered in large phyllaries with very long, spreading spines which are laced, often quite heavily, in fibers resembling cobwebs. The head is packed with disc florets which may be white to blood red to shades of purple. The largest flower heads exceed in diameter. The heads do not open in synchrony, perhaps allowing greater likelihood of being pollinated.Flora of North America, Western thistle, Cirsium occidentale (Nuttall) Jepson Cirsium occidentale var. compactum, blooming in Hearst San Simeon State Park.

The Recommendation is the only international instrument setting out norms and standards that deals exclusively with educators within universities and institutions of higher education, and as such it is of unique importance.  Process of Formation  The formulation process for the Recommendation involved extensive consultation with experts and member states of UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). As the Recommendation concerned employment conditions, there was also extensive consultation with the ILO (International Labor Organization). The Recommendation was adopted by unanimous vote of the General Conference of UNESCO, on 11 November 1997. In UNESCO usage, a recommendation is a formal international instrument accepted by the member states of UNESCO (UNESCO, 1981). As is generally the case with international instruments, the Recommendation is soft law, that is, the enforcement of the norms and standards within the Recommendation is through the force of moral persuasion. There is, however, potential for individual governments to translate the Recommendation into hard law, through individual legislation. The rationale for the Recommendation, as expressed in the Preamble, is that higher education plays a crucial role in both developed and developing societies. It is therefore of social importance to have specific norms and standards regarding employment and pay conditions for educators working within the higher education sector.  Compliance with the Recommendation  There is ongoing debate as to how effective the Recommendation has been. Dr Taye Assefa (2007) and Dr James Page (2007) have recently argued that there is widespread ignorance of the Recommendation and the standards the Recommendation sets out. Dr Page suggests that a range of measures, specifically supporting legislation by individual countries, may be necessary to ensure compliance with the standards set down in the Recommendation.

One School at a Time (original hardcover title: Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Fight Terrorism and Build Nations ... One School at a Time) is a controversial book by Greg Mortenson and David Oliver Relin published by Penguin in 2007. The book describes Mortenson's transition from a registered nurse and mountain climber to a humanitarian committed to reducing poverty and elevating education for girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Following the beginnings of his humanitarian efforts, Mortenson co-founded the Central Asia Institute (CAI), a non-profit group that has reported overseeing the construction of over 171 schools as of 2010.

In April 2011, critiques and challenges of the book and Mortenson surfaced. Author Jon Krakauer alleged that a number of Mortenson's claims in the book are fictitious and accused him of mismanaging CAI funds.Three Cups of Deceit , Jon Krakauer, April 2011.\\"‚ÄòThree Cups of Tea,‚Äô Spilled\\", by Nicholas Kristof, New York Times, April 20, 2011\\"Greg Mortenson‚Äôs Tepid Defense\\", by Tom Wright, Wall Street Journal, April 27, 2011\\"Can't Get There From Here\\" , Outside journal, Apr 27, 2011 In 2012, Mortenson agreed to repay $1 million to CAI following an investigation by the Montana attorney general. The inquiry determined that he had misspent over $6 million of the organization's money, although no criminality was found. Summary In 1993, mountaineer Greg Mortenson attempted to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain, located in the Karakoram range of Gilgit-Baltistan, as a way of honoring the memory of his deceased sister, Christa. As a memorial, he had planned to lay her amber necklace on the mountain's summit.\\"Schools for Pakistan and Afghanistan\\" , Richard Halicks, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, April 16, 2006. After more than 70 days on the mountain, Mortenson and three other climbers had their ascent interrupted by the need to complete a 75-hour life-saving rescue of a fifth climber. Mortenson became lost while descending alone, and became weak and exhausted. Instead of arriving in Askole, where his porters awaited, he came across Korphe, a small village built on a shelf jutting out from a canyon. He was greeted and taken in by the chief elder of Korphe, Haji Ali.\\"Fresh Air\\" , with Terry Gross,National Public Radio (NPR), February 7, 2002. Mortenson soon found out that the village had no school. To repay the remote community for their hospitality, Mortenson recounted in the book that he promised to build a school for the village. After difficulties in raising capital, Mortenson was introduced to Jean Hoerni, a Silicon Valley pioneer who donated the money that Mortenson needed for his school. In the last months of his life, Hoerni co-founded the Central Asia Institute with Mortenson, endowing the CAI to build schools in rural Pakistan and Afghanistan.\\"Another Way to stop Terrorism\\" , Parade Magazine, March 5, 2006. According to the book, Mortenson faced many daunting challenges in his quest to raise funds for the building of more than 55 schools in Taliban territory. Some of these challenges included death threats from Islamic mullahs, long periods of separation from his family, and being kidnapped by Taliban sympathizers.Marilyn Gardner, \\"A failed mountaineer becomes a philanthropist after a village without a school saves his life\\" , Christian Science Monitor, September 12, 2006. Authorship Though Mortenson and Relin are given equal credit for authoring Three Cups of Tea, it is written from Relin's perspective as a journalist interviewing and observing Mortenson. In the introduction, Relin admitted that his desire to see Mortenson's project succeed likely influenced his objectivity as a reporter.Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace One School at a Time. Introduction by David Oliver Relin, Penguin Books, 2007 edition, p. 5. Elizabeth Kaplan, the agent for the book, later acknowledged that the relationship between Mortenson and Relin was difficult. Mortenson, who was often traveling, was hard to track down, and Relin spoke publicly about how Mortenson should not have been named a co- author. As detailed in a New York Times article, Relin \\"suffered emotionally and financially as basic facts in the book were called into question\\" and later committed suicide on November 15, 2012.Leslie Kaufman. \\"David Oliver Relin, Adventurous Journalist, Dies at 49\\". The New York Times, December 2, 2012.\\"Coroner: Three Cups of Tea\\" co-author David Oliver Relin commits suicide\\", CBS News, Accessed December 3, 2012. Publication The original hardback edition of the book was released in 2006 with the subtitle One Man's Mission to Fight Terrorism One School at a Time. Mortenson fought against this subtitle, and the edition sold only 20,000 copies. He continued to prevail upon the publishers to change the subtitle to his first choice for the 2007 paperback edition: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace One School at a Time. His publisher relented, and the re-titled book made the New York Times nonfiction paperback bestseller list. Mortenson explained his reasoning for the subtitle in a lecture given in Fairfield, Connecticut: \\"If you just fight terrorism, it's based in fear. If you promote peace, it's based in hope.\\" \\"Educating the World One Step at a Time\\", Alison Walkley, Fairfield Citizen News, March 7, 2008. The book remained a number one New York Times bestseller for three years after its release. The book has been published in over 39 countries and has been chosen for One City One Book community reads in over 300 cities. It continues to be a popular university freshman or campus read on about three dozen campuses, and is used on over 100 university and college campuses as a Freshman Experience, Honor's program, or campus-wide read book. A young adult version of Three Cups of Tea was published by Penguin on January 22, 2009. Controversy =Criticism= In 2010, South Asian scholar and anthropologist Nosheen Ali criticized Three Cups of Tea in that ‚Äúit constructs a misleading narrative of terror in which the realities of Northern Pakistan and Muslim life-worlds are distorted through simplistic tropes of ignorance, backwardness and extremism, while histories of US geopolitics and violence are erased.‚Äù In regard to Mortenson's management style at the Central Asia Institute, Nicholas D. Kristof, formerly a supporter, said that Mortenson is \\"utterly disorganized\\", and added, \\"I am deeply troubled that only 41 percent of the money raised in 2009 went to build schools.\\" In a deeper look into Mortenson's business dealings, British journalist Jonathan Foreman wrote in a 2008 Daily Telegraph story that CAI's success was due in part to Mortenson's use of intuition and last-minute decision-making. Foreman explained that Mortenson was habitually late for meetings but that those traits worked well and were important to the success of his work in the Balti region of Pakistan. Baltistanis have no tenses in their language, are vague on their timekeeping, and make their own decisions largely based on intuition. =Allegations= On the April 17, 2011, broadcast of CBS News' 60 Minutes, correspondent Steve Kroft alleged inaccuracies in Three Cups of Tea and its sequel, Stones into Schools: Promoting Peace with Books, Not Bombs, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as financial improprieties in the operation of the Central Asia Institute. The 60 Minutes report made the following allegations: * Some of the events recounted in Three Cups of Tea, including Mortenson getting lost on the way down from K2, stumbling into Korphe, and promising to build a school, did not take place. * The story recounted in Stones into Schools about Mortenson's capture by the Taliban did not occur. His purported kidnappers state he was a guest, and the Taliban did not exist in the country at that time. * Schools that the Central Asia Institute claims to have built either have not been built, have been built and abandoned, are used for other purposes such as grain storage, or have not been supported by CAI after they were built. * The amount of money Central Asia Institute spends on advertising Mortenson's books and paying the travel expenses of his speaking tours, including hiring private jets, is excessive relative to other comparable charitable institutions. 60 Minutes asked Mortenson for an interview before their broadcast, but he did not respond to their requests. Jon Krakauer, a former financial supporter of CAI, questioned Mortenson's accounts separately and was interviewed for the 60 Minutes segment. The day after the broadcast, Krakauer published his allegations in a lengthy online article, Three Cups of Deceit ‚Äî How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way. In the article, Krakauer documents how he had been captivated by Mortenson's story and donated substantial sums to CAI, but subsequently heard stories of misconduct and began investigating. Krakauer stated that he invited Mortenson to address his allegations and scheduled an interview where Mortenson lives, but Mortenson canceled the interview. =Responses= Mortenson responded to the allegations made against him in the Bozeman Chronicle: \\"I stand by the information conveyed in my book, and by the value of CAI's work in empowering local communities to build and operate schools that have educated more than 60,000 students.\\" Mortenson further explained, \\"The time about our final days on K2 and ongoing journey to Korphe village and Skardu is a compressed version of events that took place in the fall of 1993...\\" Scott Darsney, a respected mountaineer and friend of Greg Mortenson, sent an email, subsequently turned into an exclusive article for the online version of Outside magazine, as a response to the allegations against Mortenson.Scott Darsney, ‚ÄúScott Darsney Questions the Accuracy and Fairness of ‚ÄúThree Cups of Deceit‚Äù‚Äù, Outside Magazine, April 13, 2009 Darsney questioned the accuracy and fairness of both the Krakauer piece and the 60 Minutes report. Darsney had been interviewed by Krakauer, and maintained that Krakauer either misquoted or misunderstood what he said. CAI responded to Krakauer's allegations by releasing a comprehensive list of projects completed over several years and currently in progress. The list was released in December 2011. In April 2012, following a year of investigation by the Montana attorney general, Mortenson agreed to repay $1 million to the CAI. The Montana inquiry determined that he had misspent over $6 million of the organization's money, although no criminality was found. Montana Attorney General Steve Bullock said: \\"Mr Mortenson may not have intentionally deceived the board or his employees, but his disregard for and attitude about basic record-keeping and accounting for his activities essentially had the same effect.\\" =Lawsuits= In May 2011, Jean Price and Michele Reinhart, Democratic Party representatives in Montana, along with Dan Donovan, a Great Falls attorney, filed a class-action lawsuit against Mortenson and asked a federal judge in Missoula to place all proceeds from the purchase of Mortenson's books into a trust to be used for humanitarian purposes. The total of Mortenson's book sales then stood near $5 million.Greg Mortenson sued for fraud and racketeering for \\"Three Cups of Tea\\", The Daily Beast, May 6, 2011CNN wire staff. \\"Planned lawsuit targets charity, author of 'Three Cups of Tea'.\\" CNN.

Among them were La Sylphe, Eva Tanguay, Lotta Faust and Gertrude Hoffman.Behind The Scenes With Five Salomes, Syracuse Herald, Sunday Morning, August 30, 1908, pg. 18.

In 1908 she wore an abbreviated tarletan skirt in her rendition of the Salome dance at Huber's 14th Street (Manhattan) Museum. Regarding her inspiration, she admitted to taking notice of any newspaper or magazine with a picture of Salome. However she professed to have neither read the Bible or been aware of the story of Salome and Herod Antipas. She was apprehensive that the police would soon prohibit her competitors' presentations of the Salome dance. Olcott was frank in saying \\"some of 'em ain't refined\\". She feared this would lead to the cancellation of all performances of the dance. She possessed exquisitely formed, tiny feet, which earned for her the \\"silver slippers\\", presented to the woman with the \\"smallest and most beautiful feet in Paris\\". Following her selection, Olcott signed a contract which catapulted her from a chorus girl to one of the most well paid stars of the French stage. She also received as gifts more than one hundred pairs of shoes, especially made for her tiny feet.\\"Cinderella of the Paris Stage\\", San Antonio Light, October 18, 1931, pg. 52.

Marriage to Russian noble Olcott became the first wife of Count Alexis Constantinovitch Zarnekau, a Russian nobleman and cousin of Czar Nicholas II, whom she secretly wedded. Vera Ivanova, as she was known when married, eventually tired of her husband's lavish attention and the luxuries he bestowed on her. She made her way back to United States and was soon divorced by Zarnekau. The Count made provisions for his final Slavic estates to be given to Olcott.

Olcott supposedly received a \\"mysterious letter\\" from abroad stating that Zarnekau was still alive. According to this news item Olcott returned to the United States at Zarnekau's instruction during World War I. She ventured to Europe in 1926 with a desire to reunite with him, so that they could resume their position in \\"Czarist circles\\". At the time there was still hope of a royal restoration in Russia.

It was discovered on 17 August 1936, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, and named after the legendary warrior Ajax from Greek mythology. The assumed C-type asteroid belongs to the 40 largest Jupiter trojans and has a longer than average rotation period of 29.4 hours.  Orbit and classification  Ajax is a C-type asteroid, that orbits in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of its orbit (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during or shortly after the early stages of the formation of the Solar System. More than 4,500 Jupiter trojans in the Greek camp and 7,000 in total have been discovered. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7‚Äì5.9 AU once every 12 years and 3 months (4,459 days; semi-major axis of 5.3 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 18¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg 6 days after its official discovery observations in August 1936.  Physical characteristics  Ajax is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, while its V‚ÄìI color index of 0.96 agrees with most D-type asteroids, which is the dominant spectral type among the large Jupiter trojans. = Rotation period = In December 2010, a rotational lightcurve of Ajax was obtained from photometric observations taken by Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 29.38 hours with a brightness variation of 0.30 magnitude (), superseding fragmentary photometric measurements by Richard P. Binzel (1988), and by Roberto Crippa and Federico Manzini (2009) at the Sozzago Astronomical Station , which gave a period of 28.4 and 34 hours, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Ajax measures between 81.69 and 96.34 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.048 and 0.0665. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0508 and a diameter of 81.43 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.3.  Naming  This minor planet was named for Ajax the Great, a Greek warrior of great strength and courage in the Trojan War. He is the half brother of Teucer and son of king Telamon, who kills himself because Achilles armor was awarded to Odysseus. The Jupiter trojans , and and are all named after these figures from Greek mythology. The official naming of Ajax was first cited in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

The Saravanapoikai tank is located adjacent to the hill. The diamond studded Vel held by Subramaniyar is of great beauty. Legend has it that Indra and Agastyar worshipped Subramanyar here. Legend also has it that the Saravanapoikai tank was created when Murugan struck his spear to the ground, upon being requested by his consort. Legend has it that this temple was first discovered by a Pandya king who came here on a hunting expedition after visiting the Perumal temple at Tirukkurunkudi and that the temple was expanded by his descendants. Vallioor was under the governance of Kulasekhara Pandyan of the 13th century, who fortified the village. =Festivals= Giri pradakshinam is considered to be of importance here as in Tiruvannamalai, Kunnakkudi and Palani. Seven worship services are carried out each day. Skanda Sashti is celebrated with great splendour here as are the float festival in the month of Karttikai and the annual festival in the month of Chittirai. Kodai in Sudlaimadan Temple is celebrated on the first Friday of Adi month and draws devotees from all over the world.

It was discovered on 3 August 1937, by astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The dark D/P-type asteroid belongs to the largest Jupiter trojans and has a notably elongated shape and a longer than average rotation period of 24.49 hours. Diomedes was the first Jupiter trojan successfully observed during an occultation event of star. It was named after the hero Diomedes from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Diomedes is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during or shortly after the early stages of the formation of the Solar System. More than 4,500 Jupiter trojans in the Greek camp have already been discovered. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.0‚Äì5.4 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,329 days; semi-major axis of 5.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 20¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as ' at Lowell Observatory in February 1931. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg with its official discovery observation in August 1937.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Diomedes has an ambiguous spectral type, closest to the dark D-type asteroids and somewhat similar to the primitive P-type asteroids. Its V‚ÄìI color index of 0.810 is also lower than that measured for most D-type Jupiter trojans (0.95). = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Diomedes have been obtained from photometric observations since the 1960s. The so-far best-rated photometric observations by Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station and Santana Observatory in November 2008, gave a longer-than average rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = In the 1970s, radiometric observations were published in the Tucson Revised Index of Asteroid Data (TRIAD) compilation gave a diameter of 173.0 kilometers with a radiometric albedo 0.021. According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Diomedes measures between 117.786 and 172.60 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.028 and 0.061. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0313 and a diameter of 164.31 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.30. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0313 and a diameter of 164.31 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.30. Diomedes is the third largest Jupiter trojan according to IRAS and Akari, and the 9th largest based on NEOWISE data: = Occultation and shape = Diomedes was the first Jupiter trojan that was successfully observed during an asteroid occultation, when it occulted the star HIP 014402A over Japan on 7 November 1997. The silhouette was elongated with a major and minor occultation axis of kilometers (poor fit). The ellipsoid dimensions of kilometers ‚Äì corresponding to a mean-diameter of 132.5 kilometers, equivalent to the volume of a sphere ‚Äì were estimated using follow-up photometry at Ond≈ôejov Observatory and Mitaka Observatory that determined the body's rotational phase at the exact time of the occultation event.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after the hero Diomedes, King of Argos and known for his participation in the Trojan War, regarded as the best warriors of the Achaeans, just behind Achilles and alongside with Ajax.

It was discovered on 19 September 1950, by Belgian astronomer Sylvain Arend at Uccle Observatory in Belgium, and later named after the hero Antilochus from Greek mythology. The dark D-type asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 15.9 hours. It forms an asteroid pair with 3801 Thrasymedes.  Classification and orbit  Antilochus is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9‚Äì5.4 AU once every 11 years and 7 months (4,244 days; semi- major axis of 5.13 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 29¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as ' at Heidelberg Observatory in November 1926. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Uccle in September 1950. = Asteroid pair = In 1993, Andrea Milani suggested that Antilochus forms an asteroid pair with 3801 Thrasymedes, using the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), which looks for groupings of neighboring asteroids based on the smallest distances between them in the proper orbital element space. Asteroid pairs, which at some point in the past had very small relative velocities, are typically formed by a collisional break-up of a parent body. Alternatively, they may have been former binary asteroids which became gravitationally unbound and are now following similar but different orbits around the Sun. The astronomer describes the finding as statistically significant though difficult to account for by a regular collisional event. The Antilochus‚ÄìThrasymedes pair is not listed at the Johnston's archive.  Naming  This minor planet was named after prince Antilochus from Greek mythology. He was the youngest son of King Nestor (), close friend of Greek hero Achilles () and commander of the Greek contingent of the Pylians during the Trojan War. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in May 1952 ().  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen, Barucci and Tesco classification, Antilochus is a dark D-type asteroid, with a V‚ÄìI color index of 0.95. The D-type is the most common spectral type among the Jupiter trojans. = Rotation period = In December 2009 and June 2016, rotational lightcurves of Antilochus were obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Robert Stephens at the Santana Observatory and at the Center for Solar System Studies (CS3) in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 31.52 and 31.54 hours with an amplitude of 0.09 and 0.11 magnitude, respectively (). Follow-up observations over a total of 11 nights by Stephens in August 2017 gave the so-far best-rated lightcurve with a period of hours ‚Äì which corresponds to half the period solution of the former results ‚Äì and a slightly higher brightness variation of 0.12 magnitude (). Stephen's period determination supersedes previously reported results by Vincenzo Zappal√† (1985; 12 h), Federico Manzini (2007; 12 h) and Ren√© Roy (2009; 22.5 h) (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Antilochus measures between 101.62 and 111.69 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.053 and 0.063. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0633 and a diameter of 101.62 kilometers, with Pravec's revised absolute magnitude of 8.59.

Lazo as his successor. He served the Archdiocese of Jaro from 9 May 2000 until 14 February 2018. Biography Angel Lagdameo was born on 2 August 1940 in Lucban, Quezon. A graduate of San Jose Seminary, Ateneo de Manila University, he was ordained priest on 19 December 1964 by Bishop Alfredo Ma. Obviar. He served in various capacities in Mount Carmel Seminary and St Alphonsus School of Theology for fifteen years. In 1978 he served as Protonotary of the First Diocesan Synod of Lucena convoked by Bishop Jose T. Sanchez. On 12 August 1980 he was consecrated bishop as an auxiliary to Cardinal Julio Rosales. In 1986 he was secretary general of the Fourth Diocesan Synod of Cebu convoked by Cardinal Ricardo Vidal. In the same year he became Coadjutor Bishop of Dumaguete, succeeding Bishop Epifanio B. Surban on 2 August 1989. As Bishop of Dumaguete he convoked its first diocesan synod in 1992 a year after the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines. Ecclesial background From 1994 to 1998, Lagdameo was chairman of the Office of Laity of the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. During his term he gave conferences and participated in conventions of the Catholic laity in various countries of Asia. From 1990 to January 2000 he served as chairman of the CBCP Episcopal Commission for the Laity and chairman of the National Committee for the Great Jubilee Year 2000. he was concurrently the Global Spiritual Director of Bukas Loob sa Diyos, National Spiritual Director of the Mother Butler Guild and the World Apostolate of Fatima. On 11 March 2000 the Lagdameo was appointed by Pope John Paul II as the twelfth prelate and fifth Archbishop of Jaro. He was installed in the Cathedral of Jaro on 9 May 2000. In 2004 Blessed Hannibal di Francia, founder of the Rogationist Congregation, was approved for canonization on account of a miracle he performed on a child from Jaro who was suffering from severe meningitis. The Archbishop presided at the investigation, which lasted for three years. From 1 December 2005 to 1 December 2009 he served as president of the Catholic Bishops‚Äô Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), a maximum of two terms. On 14 February 2011 Lagdameo made his ad limina visit to Pope Benedict XVI, wherein he updated the Pope regarding the situation in the Archdiocese of Jaro. Specifically, he pointed out the implementation phase of the 3rd Diocesan Synod of Jaro. During the preparation for the Canonization of St Pedro Calungsod, he presided during the second day of the Triduum Mass in Rome on 19 October 2012. Lagdameo participated in the Light of Peace Prayer Event in the University of the Philippines Campus in Miag-ao, Iloilo on 24 May 2013. The event was organized by the Middle Way Meditation Institute and was included in the Guinness Book of World Records for flying 15,185 sky lanterns, each with a message ‚ÄúWorld Peace through Inner Peace‚Äù. Coat of Arms Lagdameo's personal coat of arms is divided vertically into two major parts; on the left side is the Arms of the Archdiocese and on the right is Archbishop Lagdameo's personal Arms. Horizontally they divided into the Chief and the Base. The Dexter or Right: Arm of the See of Jaro The black eagle and the three red roses on the sinister bend undoubtedly refer to St Elizabeth of Hungary, the patroness of the Archdiocese of Jaro. Saint Elizabeth is the daughter of the King of Hungary and the wife of a Landgrave (Count) of Thurgingia, Germany. The black eagle is said to be the bravest bird, the emblem of magninimity and fortitude of mind. And of such color was the eagle of the Roman Emperors, now used by the Germans because the color and appears at a great distance. The three red roses remind us of the legend narrated in the biography of St Elizabeth. She is generally represented as a princess graciously giving alms to the poor or holding roses in her lap; in the latter case, she is portrayed as surprised by her husband who met her unexpectedly as she went secretly on an errand of mercy, and so, the story runs, the bread she was trying to conceal suddenly turned into rose, the coconut palms on a green knoll represent Jaro. The Sinister or Left: Personal Arms of Archbishop Lagdameo: Occupying the prominent place of the Christ is the monogram of the Blessed Virgin, A and M, on the top of which is the Jesuit monogram IHS mounted on the San Jose Seminary Seal. This shows the Archbishop's loyalty to his alma mater where he had his priestly formation under the Jesuit Fathers. The wings on the side of the monogram of Our Lady completes the symbolism to represent Our Lady of the Angels on whose feast day (2 August) Archbishop Lagdameo was born. Lucban, the birthplace of the Archbishop is represented on the lower portion of the Arm by a fruit of a citrus family called \\"Lucban\\" (Citrus Maxima) from which the town got its name. The mountain represents the scenic Mount Banahaw at the foot of which lies serenely the town of Lucban. At the bottom is the Franciscan Symbol ‚Äî the hand of Christ nailed to the cross and the hand of St Francis bearing the stigma. The symbol indicates Archbishop Lagdameo's affiliation to the order of Franciscan Secular. It is also a reminder of the Patron Saint of Lucban, St. Louis, Bishop of Tolouse, a Franciscan bishop of the 13th century to whose intercession the big number of priests coming from Lucban is attributed. The Motto: Your presence, O Lord, I seek (Ps. 27:8) Faciem tuam; Domine, Requiram. I long to see your face, O Lord, Archbishop Lagdameo believes that union with God achieved through prayer is the beginning, terminus a quo, and end, terminus ad quem, of priestly or missionary activity. It was also the motto of Bishop Alfredo Ma. Obviar of Lucena, whom Lagdameo served as secretary. Political stance =2008 NBN ZTE Crisis= The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines, due to the Filipino people's clamor for a united political stance, called an emergency meeting on 25 February 2008. Under his CBCP presidency, Archbishop Leonard Legaspi of Caceres announced the Bishops' statement: \\"They refused to call for her resignation saying they wanted her, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, to be part of the moral reform process.

This precovery extends the body's observation arc by more than 5 years prior to its official discovery observation. = Menelaus cluster = In 1993, Andrea Milani suggested that Menelaus might be the parent body of an asteroid family based on a modified HCM-analysis. The finding was also mentioned by David Jewitt in 2004, who noted that the Menelaus family is the largest proposed dynamical family to exist among the Jupiter trojans, despite having only 8 members. In 2008, Fernando Roig and Ricardo Gil-Hutton described this particular aggregation of Jupiter trojans as the \\"Menelaus clan\\", which, similar to the Flora family in the inner asteroid belt, is composed of several families (or subfamilies). In this publication, the Menelaus clan encompasses a dozen clusters, if the separation criteria used in the HCM analysis are sufficiently relaxed. The principal bodies of these proposed family-like clusters include: 1647 Menelaus, 3548 Eurybates, 1749 Telamon, 12973 Melanthios, 13062 Podarkes, 5436 Eumelos, 2148 Epeios, 4007 Euryalos, 4138 Kalchas, 3063 Makhaon and others. With the exception of the Eurybates family, which was studies in more detail by Jakub Rozehnal and Miroslav Bro≈æ in 2011 (also see ), all other proposed families with their principal bodies in the Menelaus clan, including Menelaus itself, are tentative and not listed neither on the Asteroids‚ÄîDynamic Site (Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá), nor included in the robust HCM-analysis by Nesvorn√Ω (also see ). Instead, these bodies are considered non-family asteroids of the Jovian background population.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the Greek mythological figure, Menelaus, husband of Helen of Troy, brother of Agamemnon, and king and leader of the Spartan contingent of the Greek army during the Trojan War. The discoverer followed the convention to name bodies located in the camp to the east of Jupiter after famous Greek heroes. The Dictionary of Minor Planet Names also mentions that the lunar crater Menelaus was named after the Greek hero. However, based on the official International Astronomical Union‚ÄìWGPSN nomenclature, it is named after Greek geometer and astronomer Menelaus of Alexandria (70‚Äì140). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in June 1960 ().  Physical characteristics  Menelaus is an assumed C-type, while most larger Jupiter trojans are D-type asteroids. It has a V‚ÄìI color index of 0.866. = Rotation period = The Palomar Transient Factory in California obtained a rotational lightcurve of Menelaus from photometric observation in the R-band in October 2010. It gave a rotation period of 17.7390 hours with a brightness variation of 0.32 magnitude in the R-band (). In February 2014, a refined period of hours with an amplitude of 0.15 magnitude was determined by American astronomer Robert D. Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Menelaus measures 42.72 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.056. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 44.22 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 10.5.

The allotment is largely based upon the type of government they are and a formula based upon their land area and population. Section 284 of the Local Government Code of the Philippines (RA 7160) sets up the formula for the distribution of the allotment. All or nearly all of the revenue that a local government has to spend comes from their IRA, though some local governments also have additional local sources of revenue such as property taxes and government fees. Typically for municipalities, the IRA accounts for 90% of total revenues. Since cities have more sources of local revenues, their IRA ranges from 50% to 70% of their total budget. A portion of each local government unit's allotment is set aside their Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) or youth council. The IRA is automatically released to each local government unit and may not be held back by the national government for any reason, except in the extreme case of an \\"unmanageable public sector deficit\\", in which case the allotment may be adjusted but provided it not be set to \\"be less than thirty percent (30%) of the collection of national internal revenue taxes of the third fiscal year preceding the current fiscal year\\".

It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory on 23 September 1949, and named after Telamon from Greek mythology. The D-type asteroid is the principal body of the proposed Telamon family and belongs to the 60 largest Jupiter trojans. It has a rotation period of 17.0 hours and possibly a spherical shape.  Classification and orbit  Telamon is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.6‚Äì5.7 AU once every 11 years and 8 months (4,268 days; semi- major axis of 5.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at with its first observation as ' at Turku Observatory in January 1941, more than 8 years prior to its official discovery observation at Heidelberg. = Telamon family = Fernando Roig and Ricardo Gil-Hutton identified Telamon as the principal body of a small Jovian asteroid family, using the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), which looks for groupings of neighboring asteroids based on the smallest distances between them in the proper orbital element space. According to the astronomers, the Telamon family belongs to the larger Menelaus clan, an aggregation of Jupiter trojans which is composed of several families, similar to the Flora family in the inner asteroid belt. However this family is not included in David Nesvorn√Ω HCM- analysis from 2014. Instead, Telamon is listed as a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population on the Asteroids Dynamic Site (AstDyS) which based on another analysis by Milani and Kne≈æeviƒá.  Physical characteristics  Telamon is a dark D-type asteroid according to the SDSS-based taxonomy and the surveys conducted by SMASS (Xu) and Pan-STARRS. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Telamon measures between 64.90 and 81.06 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.046 and 0.078. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0469 and a diameter of 80.91 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.4. = Lightcurves = Photometric observations of Telamon by Stefano Mottola from August 1995 were used to build a lightcurve rendering a rotation period of 11.2 hours with a brightness variation of in magnitude (). In October 2010, another observation by Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in California gave a period of 16.975 hours (). In August 2017, observations by the K2 mission of the Kepler spacecraft during Campaign 6 gave two periods of 11.331 and 22.613 hours with an amplitude of 0.06 and 0.07 magnitude, respectively (). The body is possibly of spherical shape as all lightcurves measured a very small variation in brightness.  Naming  This minor planet was named by the discoverer after Telamon, from Greek mythology, who was an argonaut searching for the Golden Fleece, and father of Ajax and Teucer, after whom the minor planets 1404 Ajax and 2797 Teucer are named. Telamon banished his son Teucer (as he had been banished by his own father) when he returned home from the Trojan war without the remains of his brother.

Esham took advantage of the live band instead of the focus on heavy sampling that previous group albums featured. Allrovi described the sound as \\"a potent collage of gritty hip-hop beats with an aggressive rock tone\\", noting the relevance of this sound in relation to the group's influence on rap rock artists like Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit. Murder Dog magazine rated this album #1 of all rap albums released in 1999. Allrovi also noted a step forward in lyrical content, writing \\"It's just far too hard to stomach his group's blatant theatrics of old -- raunchy sex, Satanic baiting, unnecessary morbidity, an overall sense of utter irresponsibility, violent gang mentality\\".

Located between the Indian and Pacific Oceans, it is situated within a warm ocean region known as the Tropical Warm Pool. The maritime continent consists of many islands, peninsulas and shallow seas. The region is significant in meteorology because it is considered the most important energy source region in the entire global circulation system owing to a number of coincident factors, the most significant being geographic location and topography, both of which contribute to the development of the Tropical Warm Pool, which is the warmest large area of ocean on Earth. Coined by Colin Ramage in 1968, the name combines the terms maritime and continent normally used as opposites in the description of climate. Maritime air is humid, and continental air is dry. In the Southeast Asia region, land masses and bodies of water are, roughly-speaking, evenly distributed. Moreover, the land masses are characterized by high mountains, and the seas are among the warmest on the earth. This produces a widespread area of diurnal thunderstorms which pump huge quantities of moisture and heat high up into the atmosphere. These in turn feed the upper level winds which circle the globe.

Skull Fang is the third and final entry in a loose trilogy of games beginning with 1989's Vapor Trail. It was released for the Sega Saturn in 1997. Gameplay Players choose from one of four jets set among the flying aircraft carrier Skull Fang, as well as a pilot to fly the jet and attack the enemy's squadrons and battalions worldwide. =Jets= *F/AV-1B Silph II, US Navy - A jet with average speed and strength. Its special attack consists of an impenetrable shield that can allow the jet to Kamikaze into other vehicles. *AV-02A Mega-Valkyrie, US Army - A jet-plane with slow speed and maneuverability, but good strength. It carries a large bomb that can clear the screen of most enemies. *FV-03C Seylen-Ex - The fastest jet in the line-up, though the weakest. It has guns mounted near its tail allowing it to fire in two directions. *BV-04 SIF, Sub-Space Development - A recently developed space-jet with the best handling over the others. =Pilots= *Hawk - A hot-headed and moody male fighter pilot. *Raven - A caucasian, smooth-talking and unusually calm male bomber pilot. *Sparrow - An easy-going and somewhat cheerful, English speaking female fighter pilot. *Crane - A diligent and patriotic Japanese female Ganguro bomber pilot. =Weapons= The weapon pick-ups include the following. *Vulcan - Standard- automatic firing machine gun that fires straight forward in a hail of bullets, but can also fire backwards (depending on the jet selected). Covers a wide range of fire, but is significantly weak. *Cluster shot - A weapon consisting of green circulating shots that proffer a 'shot-gun effect' type of fire in that it spreads the further it travels. *Missiles - Multiple homing missiles that fire from six different directions on the jet. *Laser gun - A dual, straight firing laser weapon that increases in strength with upgrades, but does not cover a wide range of fire. Players also can pick up a weapon attachment that increases weapon strength and ability depending on the jet known as the S-Unit. The S-Unit can charge its strength and ultimately change its attack pattern when the players use the manual five-speed option whereupon reaching the jet's highest gear, the weapon will temporarily change to a homing weapon known as H-Unit mode. However, the S-Unit attachment can be removed and thus detonated once players hit the Bomb button. Plot Several years have passed since the events of Rohga: Armor Force in 2001, where the militant/terrorist organization Ragnarok was quelled. Though Oceania and the United States were successful in their efforts, a significant number of mechs had secretly escaped their own destruction and after several years of silence finally reappeared. The strongest of these mechs appears and begins decimating American cities at random, signifying Ragnarok's latest assault upon society itself. During those several years however, an air force unit based on the success of Operation Vapor Trail had been assembled; known as the Skull Fang squadron, the unit was founded in case the organization ever re-appeared. Consisting of four talented pilots whose personal backgrounds and information are withheld from each other, the team is sent to deal with this latest threat and to protect the terrorist's suspected target, the squad's headquarters that houses their unit's leaders. Ports and related releases Skull Fang was later ported by both Data East and Aisystem Tokyo to the Sega Saturn in 1997. This port adds several new features, such as a trial mode, a boss rush mode, a tutorial video and an additional speed mode which has two settings rather than five. Occasionally, the sprites suffer from flickering. Some arranged versions of songs from Vapor Trail are also included in the game disc as redbook audio. On February 26, 1996, Pony Canyon and Scitron Label added the arcade version's background music of Skull Fang with the background music of another Data East MLC System title, Avengers in Galactic Storm, both into an album titled Skull Fang / Avengers in Galactic Storm, which was released exclusively in Japan. This version also includes two exclusive arranged versions of the songs \\"Skull Fang\\" (Stage 1 theme) and \\"Over Boost\\" (Stage 2 Boss theme). On July 21, 2010, TEAM Entertainment added the background music of the arcade version with the background music of the first two Kuuga games, plus three other Data East shooting games (Darwin 4078, SRD: Super Real Darwin, and Act-Fancer: Cybernetick Hyper Weapon), into one album titled Data East Retro Game Music Collection, which was distributed exclusively in Japan by Sony Music Distribution. Reception A Next Generation reviewer, while acknowledging that the chase mode and back and side thrusts are variations in the shooter formula, concluded Skull Fang to be \\"a shooter in the most generic sense.\\" He scored the arcade version two out of five stars. In an article on the Saturn port, Sega Saturn Magazine called Skull Fang \\"a classic example of over hyped nonsense\\", and explained that \\"With two players on screen at once, multiple power-ups and even an original arcade mode (requiring you to turn your TV on its side, Raiden-style), Skull Fang begins to sound fairly impressive.

The Droughtmaster is a tropical breed of beef cattle developed in North Queensland, Australia by several cattlemen from crossing Brahman and British breed cattle, principally the Beef Shorthorn during the early 1900s. The breed was conceived in response to the need in the Australian Tropics for a breed of cattle which had good tick resistance and would be able to use the environment and the pastures in the most efficient manner to give higher weight gains and fertility. The Droughtmaster breed emerged after many years of crossbreeding and meticulous selection for the following properties: *calving ease, *good meat quality, *parasite resistance, *heat tolerance, *ability to adapt to the environment, *high fertility, and *docility. Other British breeds ‚Äî mainly Hereford ‚Äî have since been used in its development to arrive at a fixed tropical breed of approximately 50% Bos indicus and 50% Bos taurus genetics. Droughtmasters are medium to large with good walking and foraging abilities coupled with lower nutritional requirements to give them the ability to retain condition and keep breeding, irrespective of the prevailing conditions. Their short coat is generally red in colour, although variations from golden honey to dark red can occur. The red pigmentation in Droughtmasters helps protect the cattle from cancer eye, sunburnt udders and photosensitisation. The cattle may be polled or horned, but the vast majority are polled and exhibit only a moderate hump. They have medium to large ears and an extended dewlap.

Alongside The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), it is considered to be one of Weber's most important works. Extremely broad in scope, the book covers numerous themes including religion, economics, politics, public administration, and sociology. A complete translation of the work was not published in English until 1968. In 1998, the International Sociological Association listed this work as the most important sociological book of the 20th century.

The game was released in March 2009 and stars Vin Diesel. Gameplay The game is set in an open world environment modeled after Barcelona, full of destructible objects, alleyways, shortcuts through office blocks and a total of 31 story missions and 105 side missions. While most missions are driving-oriented, there are also foot missions which are played from a third person perspective. A wide variety of weapons are available to the player, such as pistols, assault rifles and RPGs. The game features a unique element called \\"Airjack\\", where players are able to hijack an enemy or civilian vehicle by locking on and jumping in from the one they are driving. Among the vehicles used by Milo Burik in the game is the Pontiac G8, shown in released trailers for Wheelman. Reports also indicated that the Opel Astra is a drivable vehicle. In the demo, the license plate says MRTL KM8T which is a reference to Mortal Kombat, Midway's popular fighting game. Plot Milo Burik, an undercover agent currently operating underneath the CIA, is assigned to the investigation of a package containing secretive documents, which the various criminal factions of Barcelona are intending on stealing and selling to the highest bidder. Afterwards, Milo is placed under the supervision of Anton Gallo, the assistant bureau chief of the agency, and under the identity of a wheelman, he makes his presence within the city known by acting as a getaway driver in a robbery for Lumi Vega, an independent thief who masquerades as a flamenco dancer and with involvement in the Catalan underworld, with suspicion being drawn towards her intentions on supposedly building a team of professional thieves for a potential heist. Afterwards, Milo infiltrates the Chulos Canallas, an African- American gang who operates an illegal drug-racket. Milo, befriends Miguel Delgado, the reckless enforcer of the gang and the brother of Stavo, the leader of the gang, after retrieving stolen vehicles for their street races and confronts Felipe Lial, the nephew of Paulo Lial, the mobster who is in charge of Los Lantos, a criminal organization that holds the strongest reputation within the city and upholds a legitimate coverup through the mayor. Because of Felipe's opportunist nature and dissatisfaction with Los Lantos' activities, Milo discovers that he has been keeping in contact with the different criminal factions and revealing private information about each of them. Following this, Milo intimidates Felipe into providing a meeting with Paulo, who becomes impressed with the former's courage and driving abilities before ordering him to escort Felipe to a deal with other gangsters in the city; Milo interrogates Felipe regarding the different criminal factions and purposefully drives recklessly throughout the city to gather the necessary information. Afterwards, the deal goes wrong and Felipe manages to kill the gangsters before betraying Milo and escaping with Lumi, who has selected the former to be her wheelman for the unknown heist, alongside Javier Ramos, a computer scientist and known associate of her previous activities. Following this, Milo approaches Adrian McGann, who provides the former with information into the underworld, and learns that Micca the Morro, an associate of Felipe, is attempting to become independent. Afterwards, Milo captures Micca and interrogates him for the location of Felipe, though he is unsure of the latter's current whereabouts and reveals that he was working with each of the criminal factions. Simultaneously, Adrian advises Milo to approach Sorin Teodor, the sociopathic enforcer of the Romanians, one of the recently formed criminal factions who work with extortion and arms trafficking, which is led by Radu Negrea, who has the strongest reputation with the Romanian underworld. However, Sorin is unsure of Felipe's whereabouts and after Milo completes a favor for him, in which he rescues one of his henchmen and recovers a stolen briefcase for him, the two of them agree to work with one another. Simultaneously, Milo returns to the Canallas and works alongside Che Taraval, the right-hand commander of the faction, to rescue Miguel from the Romanians, which impresses Stavo to the point of hiring the former to be his brother's wheelman and bodyguard for a planned heist against the Romanians, in which they massacre several gangsters and steal a truck containing weapons, though this action leads to both factions exploring the possibility of war with one another. Following this, Milo returns to Sorin and their affiliation is severely damaged because of Miguel's actions, which leads to the latter manipulating the former into delivering a \\"gift\\" to the Canallas to offer peaceful terms. However, Milo discovers that Miguel has been beaten and wired to a bomb, and has also been ditched inside a damaged vehicle that is wanted by the police. After avoiding the police, Milo delivers Miguel to the Canallas and they successfully defuse the bomb, earning Stavo's gratitude in the process. Afterwards, Milo returns to Los Lantos and is tasked with kidnapping a rogue information broker before delivering him to Paulo's henchmen, who take him to his own mansion to be sold to the highest bidder. Unfortunately, the police raid the mansion and arrest Paulo's henchmen before having the broker taken into an ambulance, though Milo intercepts the ambulance and steals the broker's tracking device, which will allow them to gain access to the information, before rescuing Paulo's henchmen from custody. Eventually, Milo is brought back by Sorin to meet Radu, who offers him another chance to prove his loyalty by destroying the newspaper advertisements and the office building of the newspaper company that is partnered with the Canallas in retaliation for the heist. Unfortunately, following this, all three factions track down the documents to the La Monumental bullring and engage in a gunfight in an attempt to retrieve them; Milo arrives and guns down several gangsters, though Sorin and the Romanians' reinforcements arrive and steal the documents. Following a brief pursuit around the bullring, Milo kills Sorin, though Che retrieves the documents and flees to the subway station before stealing one of the trains. However, Milo pursues the train and shoots Che, who is killed in the ensuing crash whilst the former retrieves the documents. Afterwards, Milo tracks down Felipe and pursues him to the Barcelona Cathedral, where Lumi denounces the former and dismisses his concerns over Felipe's true loyalties. Soon after, Felipe demands that Milo meet with him for an opportunity regarding the team, though he ambushes him with the Romanians and is killed in the ensuing gunfight, with Milo discovering a dagger with Romanian engraving on it, which he uses to prove the former's deception to Lumi and Javier, who are forced to plan their heist in secret to avoid the other criminal factions. Simultaneously, Milo works undercover for each faction in upsetting the balance of power by massacring their gangsters, stealing from each of their warehouses and destroying their territories, though this exposes his undercover status in the process, and depending on who's faction the player had attacked the worst, Milo will eliminate either Paulo, Stavo or Radu in the midst of the gang war, effectively destroying their factions. Soon after, Lumi and Javier are cornered by one of the factions in the cathedral, leading to a gunfight that results in the death of the leader of the gang (Stavo attempts to avenge Che's death, Radu attempts to kill Milo for his betrayal, Paulo attempts to kill Lumi for her association with Milo) and the destruction of the cathedral. Milo, Lumi and Javier escape the carnage and use the documents to track down the briefcase, which they successfully steal from the buyer whilst Javier assists in holding off the police. Unfortunately, the briefcase is stolen by the remaining faction, forcing them to kill the surviving leader and retrieve the item, though Javier is killed in the process. Afterwards, Milo and Lumi approach Gallo, who reveals the former's undercover status, and steals the briefcase to ensure that he receives the mass fortune. Following this, Milo pursues Gallo to his yacht and drives over a ramp at the docks, exiting the car before it destroys the yacht, killing Gallo, before parting ways with Lumi and ensuring that her death is faked to prevent the agency from tracking her down. Development Wheelman was announced in February 2006 by publisher Midway Games as the second of three titles in a joint collaboration between Midway and MTV Networks. Midway Games collaborated with Tigon Studios to design the game. After multiple delays over the course of around three years, Wheelman was released in March 2009. Film adaptation Simultaneously with the announcement of the video game in February 2006, a film adaptation was announced with Vin Diesel in the lead role and Rich Wilkes, who worked with Diesel on xXx (2002), was hired to write the script. Paramount Pictures and MTV Films were announced to collaborate on the project. Production of the film, with no script written yet, was estimated to be 18 months away from February 2006. The film will be a sequel to the video game, which will establish the background. However, as of 2020, there has been no update on the status of the film project. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many of the reviewers criticised the game for falling short of story mode and lacking multiplayer functionality. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstman said \\"Wheelman has some great ideas that are executed well, but a lot of the peripheral stuff is underwhelming.\\" GamePro, however, called the PlayStation and Xbox 360 versions \\"a GTA-meets-Burnout romp.\\" GameSpot said of the same console versions, \\"Wheelman offers plenty of movie-style thrills, although it's hamstrung by terrible on-foot gameplay.\\" Hyper's Darren Wells commended the game for \\"cool and useful special driving moves [and] genuinely new locale\\". However, he criticised it for \\"meaningless vehicle handling, cheating AI, poor on-foot level design [and] bland graphics\\". Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph gave the Xbox 360 version a score of seven out of ten and said that it \\"isn't exactly the smartest video game out there. In fact, it's quite possibly the dumbest game I've played in a long while. However, it's wickedly self-aware of its own silliness and revels in it, leading to the kind of guilty pleasure that can only come with such a willful grasp of absurdity. And smashing things up, of course.\\" 411Mania gave the PS3 version six out of ten and said, \\"Wheelman will probably be a decent rental, and maybe a solid pick- up during Best Buy's awesome $10 clearance sales, but it's not worth a full retail purchase.\\" Teletext GameCentral gave the Xbox 360 version four out of ten and said, \\"Vin Diesel proves not to have the magic touch after all, with this technically inept Driver wannabe.\\" References External links  Category:2009 video games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Barcelona in fiction Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Detective video games Category:Organized crime video games Category:Midway video games Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"Wheelman (video game)"},{"id":"14901573","text":"Clarkia breweri is a species of wildflower known by the common names fairy fans and Brewer's clarkia.

Cabindan rebels kidnapped and ransomed off foreign oil workers throughout the 1990s to in turn finance further attacks against the national government. Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) militants stopped buses, forcing Chevron Oil workers out, and setting fire to the buses on March 27 and April 23, 1992. A large scale battle took place between FLEC and police in Malongo on May 14 in which 25 mortar rounds accidentally hit a nearby Chevron compound. The government, fearing the loss of their prime source of revenue, began to negotiate with representatives from Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Renewal (FLEC-R), Armed Forces of Cabinda (FLEC-FAC), and the Democratic Front of Cabinda (FDC) in 1995. Patronage and bribery failed to assuage the anger of FLEC-R and FLEC-FAC and negotiations ended. In February 1997, FLEC-FAC kidnapped two Inwangsa SDN-timber company employees, killing one and releasing the other after receiving a US$400,000 ransom. FLEC-FLAC kidnapped 11 people in April 1998, nine Angolans and two Portuguese, released for a US$500,000 ransom. FLEC-R kidnapped five Byansol oil engineering employees, two Frenchman, two Portuguese, and an Angolan, on March, 1999. While militants released the Angolan, the government complicated the situation by promising the rebel leadership $12.5 million for the hostages. When Ant√≥nio Bento Bembe, the President of FLEC-R, showed up, the Angolan army arrested him and his bodyguards. The Angolan army later forcibly freed the other hostages on July 7. By the end of the year, the government had arrested the leadership of all three rebel organizations. In addition to FDC's war against the Angolan government, the government was also opposed by a United States-supported rebel movement, UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi, which was involved in military conflict in the Angolan Civil War from 1975 until Savimbi was killed in combat by government troops in 2002.

Until then, same-sex couples could only obtain marriage licenses in certain counties of the state. Eight of the 33 counties, covering 58% of the state's population, had begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in August and September 2013. New Mexico's marriage statute is not specific as to gender. It is the only state lacking a state statute or constitutional provision explicitly addressing same-sex marriage. Lacking a state law or judicial ruling concerning same-sex marriage prior to December 19, 2013, policy for the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level at the discretion of local issuing authorities i.e., some counties recognized same-sex marriage and issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while others did not. Despite the ruling by the New Mexico Supreme Court allowing same-sex marriages in the state, some of New Mexico's Native American tribes (most notably the Navajo Nation) continue to prohibit same-sex marriages within their jurisdictions and do not recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. A small number of same-sex marriages were licensed in Sandoval County in 2004. The practice was halted later that same day, February 20, after New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid issued a ruling they were invalid. On August 21, 2013, the county clerk of Do√±a Ana County, on his own initiative, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Later in the month, three district judges ruling on separate lawsuits ordered first Santa Fe County, then Bernalillo County, and then Taos County, to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, with a fourth judge ordering the same in Grant County in September. A similar ruling was made in Los Alamos County, where the county clerk said she would not comply with the order until it was upheld on September 4, the first time a New Mexican judge affirmed a ruling for same-sex marriage after it had been challenged. Meanwhile, county clerks in San Miguel and Valencia counties altered marriage licenses for same-sex couples. On August 29, 2013, New Mexico's county clerks voted unanimously to ask the New Mexico Supreme Court to rule on the legality of same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court held a hearing on their petition on October 23. On December 19, 2013, that court issued a unanimous decision in Griego v. Oliver holding that marriage licenses must be issued to couples without respect to gender, making New Mexico the 17th state to legalize same-sex marriage. Statutes New Mexico Statutes ¬ß40-1 and ¬ß40-4 define marriage and the legal status of marriages from other jurisdictions; * \\"Marriage is contemplated by the law as a civil contract, for which the consent of the contracting parties, capable in law of contracting, is essential.\\" * \\"All marriages celebrated beyond the limits of this state, which are valid according to the laws of the country wherein they were celebrated or contracted, shall be likewise valid in this state, and shall have the same force as if they had been celebrated in accordance with the laws in force in this state.\\" In July 2007, a Massachusetts court determined that New Mexico did not have a statute banning same-sex marriage and therefore same-sex couples that were resident in New Mexico could marry in Massachusetts. State Representative Al Park raised the issue a few years later, posing a formal inquiry to New Mexico Attorney General Gary K. King who offered his view on January 4, 2011, that \\"a same-sex marriage that is valid under the laws of the country or state where it was consummated would likely be valid in New Mexico.\\" A spokesman for Governor Susana Martinez responded by noting noted \\"that no New Mexico court has ruled on this issue.\\" The advocacy group Freedom to Marry complained that New Mexico had yet to respond to the Massachusetts ruling even though, in its view, \\"New Mexico's laws do not prohibit marriage between same-sex couples\\". The plaintiffs in Griego v. Oliver argued when they initiated their lawsuit in March 2013 that the failure of New Mexico's statutes to specify the gender of the parties to a marriage contract and their gender-neutral language allowed state officials to interpret them to allow them to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. When the New Mexico Supreme Court issued it decision in that case on December 19, 2013, the court unanimously held: Legislative efforts Legislation that would allow or prohibit same-sex marriage, or that would provide for domestic partnerships, has been introduced several times but has never been passed. In January 2008, domestic partnership bill HB 9,Text of House Bill 9. advocated by Governor Bill Richardson as part of his legislative agenda, passed the state's House by a 33 to 31 vote and was sent to the state Senate, which took no action on it. A similar bill had been defeated in the 2007 Legislature. House Bill 47, providing that marriage may only be between a man and a woman, and House Joint Resolution 3, proposing a constitutional amendment to define marriage as being between a man and a woman, both died when the Legislature adjourned on February 14, 2008, without acting on them. On February 27, 2009, domestic partnership legislation that would grant both same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples many of the same rights found in a state marriage was voted down in the State Senate by a 25-17 margin, with 10 Democrats and 15 Republicans opposing the legislation. Supported by Governor Bill Richardson, supporters vowed to take up the issue again sometime later in 2009. On February 15, 2010, a domestic partnership bill sponsored by Senator Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) was defeated in a Senate committee, \\"[striking] a blow to Richardson, who made extending many of the same rights enjoyed by married couples to gays and lesbians part of his legislative agenda.\\" A proposed constitutional amendment sponsored by Senator William Sharer (R-Farmington) that would have limited marriage to opposite-sex couples was defeated by another Senate committee. On January 22, 2013, Representative Brian Egolf, a Santa Fe Democrat, introduced a resolution (House Joint Resolution 3), which would put a constitutional amendment allowing same-sex marriage to a popular vote in November 2014. He said, \\"This will be the law sooner than people think.\\" The measure's co-sponsors included another Santa Fe Democrat, Representative Stephen Easley. It required approval by both houses of the Legislature. On January 31, the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee approved the measure in a 3-2 vote. On February 21, the Voters and Elections Committee defeated it on a 7-4 vote. On January 22, Representative Nora Espinoza, a Republican, introduced House Joint Resolution 4 which would put a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage to a popular vote in November 2014. The committee failed to approve it in a 2-3 vote on February 5. The Legislature ended its legislative session on February 20, 2014, without taking any further action on the resolution. = Codified legislation = In March 2019, the New Mexico Legislature passed a bill within both houses unanimously (House vote 62-0 and Senate vote 39-0) to codify same-sex marriage legislation. The bill was signed into law in April by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and went into effect since July 1, 2019. Local jurisdictions New Mexico counties on licensing same-sex marriages, prior to the ruling in Griego v. Oliver by the New Mexico Supreme Court which legalized same-sex marriages statewide: under court order (Bernalillo, Grant, Los Alamos, Santa Fe, and Taos) on clerk's initiative (Do√±a Ana, San Miguel, and Valencia) formerly issued licenses (Sandoval) did not issue licenses or receive court direction (all others) Due to perceived ambiguity in New Mexico's laws regarding marriage, which statutorily do not define marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman, counties in the state differed in their treatment of same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses prior to the New Mexico Supreme Court ruling on December 19, 2013. =2004= ;Sandoval County On February 20, 2004, at the time of the widely publicized same-sex weddings in San Francisco, Sandoval County clerk Victoria Dunlap, a married Republican with two children, began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Dunlap had called the county attorney for input after receiving an inquiry about issuing a marriage license to a same-sex couple. He found that gender was only mentioned on the marriage license application form and advised her to consult the Attorney General. She sought advice from several state officials for several days without success and decided to issue licenses to same-sex couples beginning on February 20. She told the Albuquerque Journal: \\"This has nothing to do with politics or morals. If there are no legal grounds that say this should be prohibited, I can't withhold it. ... This office won't say no until shown it's not permissible.\\" The Sandoval County courthouse was quickly thronged by same-sex couples applying for marriage licenses when Dunlap's decision was reported. Two local ministers officiated at marriage ceremonies for 26 couples on the courthouse steps on February 20. According to a suit filed against Dunlap in July by the Attorney General, 66 licenses were issued and by March 23 some 64 of the couples had married \\"as evidenced by the return and filing of licenses and Certificates of Marriage.\\"Motion to Dismiss, State of New Mexico v. Victoria Dunlap .Petition for Writ of Mandamus, State of New Mexico v. Victoria Dunlap . Later that day, New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid issued an opinion stating that the licenses were \\"invalid under state law\\", citing the license application form and several statutes and court decisions. The Sandoval County Clerk's Office stopped issuing them the same day. The Sandoval County Commission voted on February 23 to allow couples married on the 20th to register their marriages. A district court judge later issued a restraining order against Dunlap, prohibiting her from issuing any further licenses to same-sex couples for the duration of her term as clerk, which ended on January 1, 2005. Dunlap then filed a motion with the New Mexico Supreme Court for permission to continue issuing the licenses, but on July 8, 2004, the court rejected the motion. The restraining order was never lifted. County and state officials criticized Dunlap and the Sandoval County Republican Central Committee censured her and said she \\"brought disgrace to the party as a whole\\". Dunlap did not seek reelection. The validity of the same-sex marriages licensed in 2004 remained uncertain, though in 2010 a New Mexico court approved a divorce for one of the marriages. On August 9, 2010, State District Judge Sarah Singleton ruled that the marriage license issued to one same-sex couple in 2004 was valid and subject to divorce proceedings, but she did not otherwise address the legal status of same-sex marriage in the state. On August 28, 2013, after licenses issued in 2004 were found stamped \\"void\\", Attorney General Gary King advised Sandoval County that the licenses remain \\"presumptively valid\\" until a court rules otherwise. =2013= In August 2013, several counties began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples either on the initiative of the county clerk or under court order. Counties issuing marriage licenses ;Do√±a Ana County On August 21, 2013, officials in Do√±a Ana County began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples at the courthouse in Las Cruces. The county clerk, Lynn Ellins, announced the change of policy, stating, \\"After careful review of New Mexico's laws it is clear that the state's marriage statutes are gender neutral and do not expressly prohibit Do√±a Ana County from issuing marriage licenses to same- gender couples. Any further denial of marriage licenses to these couples violates the United States and New Mexico Constitution and the New Mexico Human Rights Act. Do√±a Ana County is upholding New Mexico law by issuing these marriage licenses, and I see no reason to make committed couples in Do√±a Ana County wait another minute to marry.\\"\\"Ellins: Do√±a Ana County Issuing Same- Gender Marriage Licenses,\\" Do√±a Ana County official website, 21 August 2013, accessed August 24, 2013. Approximately two dozen same-sex couples received licenses that day, and about 90 couples by Friday, August 23, including some from the neighboring state of Texas.\\"Santa Fe clerk begins issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples,\\" Santa Fe New Mexican, 23 August 2013, accessed August 23, 2013. A group of Republican state legislators announced their intention to seek a court order to stop the county from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples; see Sharer v. Ellins for one such lawsuit filed. Republican Governor Susana Martinez reiterated her opposition to same-sex marriage, as well as her position that the legalization of same-sex unions should only be approved by a vote of the people. State Attorney General Gary King, a Democrat, said his office will take no action to stop Ellins from issuing licenses to same-sex couples. \\"We feel like our position that the laws aren't constitutional presents a barrier from us bringing action in that suit,\\" said King, referring to parts of the New Mexico Administrative Code that make gendered references to married persons. ;Santa Fe County On March 19, Santa Fe Mayor David Coss, City Councilor Patti Bushee, and City Attorney Geno Zamora announced that a resolution recognizing same-sex marriages would be introduced at the next Santa Fe City Council meeting on March 27. Zamora released a legal opinion that \\"New Mexico's statutory definition of marriage is gender-neutral.\\"Combs, Jacob. \\"Santa Fe officials urge same-sex couples to wed, saying New Mexico law already allows marriage equality,\\" Equality on Trial, March 19, 2013, accessed March 20, 2013. Coss urged county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. However, Santa Fe County Clerk Geraldine Salazar said she would not issue them until the law was clarified by state courts or the Legislature. Bushee said she expected the issue to reach the New Mexico Supreme Court. On April 24, 2013, by a vote of five to one with two abstentions, the Santa Fe City Council passed a motion recognizing same- sex marriage as legal in New Mexico and advising county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On July 20, 2013, the Santa Fe County Commission approved a similar resolution. Salazar began issuing licenses to same-sex couples on August 23, following an order issued by a state district judge the day before in Hanna v. Salazar. ;Bernalillo County On August 26, 2013, in Griego v. Oliver, an Albuquerque judge ruled in favor of a lesbian couple and ordered Bernalillo County Clerk Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a self- identified proponent of legalized same-sex marriage, to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in Bernalillo County, the state's largest county by population. Judge Alan Malott's opinion stated that any laws that contradict New Mexico's gender-neutral language on marriage and the state's Human Rights Act are unconstitutional. On August 27, in compliance with this court order, County Clerk Oliver began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. ;San Miguel County On August 27, San Miguel County Clerk Melanie Rivera said her county would follow the lead of three other New Mexican counties in issuing gender-neutral marriage licenses to same-sex couples. ;Valencia County Valencia County Clerk Peggy Carabajal became the first Republican county clerk in New Mexico since Victoria Dunlap nine years prior to issue same-sex marriage licenses, effective on August 27. ;Taos County In Stark v. Martinez, a district judge issued a writ of mandamus similar to those in the Santa Fe and Bernalillo county lawsuits ordering the county clerk in Taos County to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples or else explain why not. The clerk, Anna Martinez, said she would not contest the ruling and confirmed the county would begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on August 28. The court order came hours after Martinez said she would not issue same-sex marriage licenses unless ordered to do so, declaring, \\"I have to follow the law, and the law requires that marriage licenses state the male and female.\\" ; Los Alamos County On August 27, Los Alamos County Clerk Sharon Stover said she would not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples until she received a court order instructing her to do so.\\"Taos becomes sixth county to issue same-sex marriage licenses,\\" Santa Fe New Mexican, August 27, 2013, accessed August 29, 2013. She said \\"I want to have a good law that will hold up for all people. We need a ruling from the State Supreme Court.\\" On August 29, in Newton v. StoverNew Mexico Courts Docket No. D-132-CV-201300094 Judge Sheri Raphaelson ordered Stover to issue the license or appear on September 4 to explain her refusal to do so. On September 3, Stover announced she would not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and would appear in court on September 4 to argue her case. She said: On September 4, after hearing Stover's arguments, Raphaelson ordered her to issue the marriage licenses. Los Alamos County began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples later that afternoon, although Stover said she will continue to use forms that state \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" for the individuals entering into marriage until the Legislature issues new, gender-neutral licenses. ;Grant County Robert Zamarripa, Grant County clerk, said on August 27 that he was waiting for instructions from a court of law before issuing same-sex marriage licenses. The Grant County Clerk's Office turned away at least two same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses in Silver City, the county seat. In Katz v. Zamarripa,New Mexico Courts Docket No. D-608-CV-201300235 District Judge J.C. Robinson ordered Zamarripa to begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses on September 3 or else appear in court. Zamarripa said that his office would begin providing the licenses during the second week of September. Grant County began issuing licenses to same-sex couples on September 9, according to local media. Counties not issuing marriage licenses ;Sandoval County On August 27, Sandoval County Clerk Eileen Garbagni acknowledged \\"nonstop\\" calls to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but said that on the advice of the County Attorney she would not join other county clerks in issuing them without a court order. On August 31, in Gering v. New Mexico,New Mexico Courts Docket No. D-1329-CV-201301715 the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against Garbagni and the state on behalf of a lesbian couple denied a marriage license. Judge James Lawrence Sanchez, to whom the case was originally assigned, recused himself on September 5. The case was reassigned to Judge George P. Eichwald. ;Union County On August 27, Union County Clerk Mary Lou Harkin said in response to questions about whether the county would follow Bernalillo County in licensing same-sex marriages, \\"Not yet.\\" Harkin said she will \\"hold off for now\\" until she receives a court order \\"or other direction\\". New Mexico county clerks On August 29, 2013, New Mexico's 33 county clerks voted to ask the New Mexico Supreme Court to rule on the legality of same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court on August 16 had rejected a request to consolidate and hear the same-sex marriage lawsuits being heard in several lower courts. On September 5, an attorney for the New Mexico Association of Counties filed a request on the clerks' behalf to be allowed to intervene in Griego v. Oliver. The clerks were not appealing the decision in that case, but asking the Supreme Court to halt the lawsuits against them in district court until it clarified New Mexico law for the lower courts, including the issuance of licenses to same-sex couples and the clerks' authority to modify the forms used. The two clerks who were defendants in Griego v. Oliver were not joining their peers in this action because they were already parties to the case. The Supreme Court heard the Association's petition on October 23. Court cases =Griego v. Oliver= District Court On March 21, 2013, in Griego v. Oliver,New Mexico Courts Docket No. D-202-CV-201302757 Rose Griego, her partner, along with another lesbian couple, as represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and others, filed a lawsuit in State District Court in Albuquerque challenging the Bernalillo County clerk's refusal to issue them marriage licenses. On June 6, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint where they were joined by three more same-sex couples seeking relief. On August 16, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, adding one more couple seeking relief, while also claiming that New Mexico's refusal to recognize their marriages \\"deprives [the plaintiffs] of hundreds of protections, benefits, and obligations of marriage that the federal government now provides to married same-sex couples in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor.\\" On August 26, District Court Judge Alan M. Malott ruled for the plaintiffs, finding that state marriage statutes that prohibit the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples \\"are unconstitutional and unenforceable under Article II, Section 18, New Mexico Constitution.\\" He ordered the clerks in Bernalillo and Santa Fe Counties to issue marriage licenses to all same-sex couples otherwise qualified. The clerk's office in Bernalillo County indicated it would do so as of August 27. Santa Fe County was already issuing them.Mallott ruling On September 3, Judge Malott reopened the case on a motion from the New Mexico Association of Counties seeking to intervene in this case. The court allowed the group to intervene and granted final declaratory judgement to the plaintiffs, allowing the Association to seek further review by the state Supreme Court. New Mexico Supreme Court On September 5, 2013, the Association of Counties petitioned New Mexico's Supreme Court for a \\"writ of superintending control\\", a legal measure which would \\"create a definitive‚Äîand uniform‚Äîlegal opinion for clerks across the state to rely on rather than waiting for possibly lengthy appeals out of several counties\\" raised at the District Court level. On September 6, the New Mexico Supreme Court docketed this case for an Extraordinary Writ Proceeding. Oral argument took place on October 23, 2013.N.M. Supreme Ct. Docket No. 34,306 While the court did not issue an opinion on October 23, same-sex marriage advocates said they were encouraged by the justices' statements, which the Journal said included \\"tough\\" and \\"pointed questions\\" for attorneys representing Republican state legislators seeking a court ban on same-sex marriage in New Mexico. Albuquerque-market television news station KRQE reported that Republican Senator Bill Sharer had suggested that voters could remove Supreme Court justices from office, vote out state legislators or pass a new constitutional amendment if they are unhappy with how the court rules. On December 19, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the State Constitution required the extension of marriage rights to same-sex couples. Its decision said that the Equal Protection Clause under Article II, Section 18 of the New Mexico Constitution required that \\"All rights, protections, and responsibilities that result from the marital relationship shall apply equally to both same-gender and opposite-gender married couples.\\" The decision made New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriages. The following day, the clerk and chief deputy clerk in Roosevelt County resigned. The clerk said she could not comply with the court's ruling with \\"a clear conscience\\" and added: \\"I felt like I'd be letting down the majority of people who voted for me.\\" In response to the Supreme Court decision, state Senator Bill Sharer proposed a joint resolution that, if passed by both houses of the Legislature, would put a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman to a popular vote. On January 6, 2014, Governor Martinez said she would not support efforts to reverse the Supreme Court's decision by enacting a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. She said: \\"I think what I said before was that yes, the people should have decided on it, but the Supreme Court has decided. ... And it's now the law of the land.\\" =Hanna v. Salazar= On June 6, 2013, Alexander Hanna and Yon Hudson, represented by Brian Egolf, Kate Ferlic and John Day, filed a similar lawsuit, Hanna v. Salazar,New Mexico Courts Docket No. D-101-CV-201302182 in district court against the Santa Fe County Clerk and the state Attorney General. On June 27, following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Windsor, the lawsuit was withdrawn from district court and filed in the New Mexico Supreme Court. On July 22, Attorney General King told the court that \\"New Mexico's guarantee of equal protection to its citizens demands that same-sex couples be permitted to enjoy the benefits of marriage in the same way and to the same extent as other New Mexico citizens\\", but he argued that the court lacks the authority to order a county clerk to issue the marriage license as the plaintiffs have requested, which only officers of the state's executive branch can do. He warned the court that doing so could invite myriad lawsuits \\"concerning any dispute a party has with any local or county official\\". On August 16, the Supreme Court declined to hear this case and a similar one, but said that the plaintiffs were entitled to an \\"expedited review\\" in the district court. On August 22, 2013, New Mexico District Judge Sarah Singleton ordered Santa Fe County Clerk Geraldine Salazar to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples or show cause why the county should not comply. Egolf told reporters, \\"This will be the first time a court anywhere in New Mexico ... has ordered same-sex couples to be married.\\"\\"NM county ordered to give gay marriage licenses days after other clerk starts granting them,\\" Washington Post, 23 August 2013, accessed August 23, 2013. Salazar said she was \\"a fervent supporter of same- sex marriage in New Mexico\\" and would issue the licenses to Hanna and Hudson and any other qualified same-sex couples. She began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including Hanna and Hudson, on August 23. About a dozen same-sex couples were married in a joint ceremony in the county commission chambers.\\"In New Mexico, Santa Fe hosts mass gay wedding today,\\" San Diego Gay and Lesbian News, 23 August 2013, accessed August 23, 2013.\\"First same-sex couples receive marriage licenses in Santa Fe County,\\" New Mexico Telegram, 23 August 2013, accessed August 23, 2013. Subsequently, defendant Geraldine Salazar, in her official capacity as county clerk, was listed as a defendant in Griego v. Oliver, with this related case (see above) before the New Mexico Supreme Court to determine statewide applicability of lower (district) court legalization of same-sex marriage. =Stark v. Martinez= On August 28, 2013, in Stark v. Martinez,New Mexico Courts Docket No. D-820-CV-201300295 New Mexico District Judge Jeff F. McElroy ordered Taos County Clerk Anna Martinez to start issuing same-sex marriage licenses or to appear to show cause why she could not. The clerk said she would not contest the order and would begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. =Sharer v. Ellins= On August 29, 2013, in Sharer v. Ellins, seven Republican state legislators‚ÄìSenators William Sharer and Steven Neville, Representatives David Gallegos, Jimmie Hall, Yvette Herrell, Dennis Roch, and James Strickler‚Äìfiled a lawsuit in the Third Judicial District Court against Do√±a Ana County Clerk Lynn Ellins seeking an immediate stay of the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The case was assigned to Judge James T. Martin. On September 3, 2013, eight additional Republican lawmakers joined the suit. The group filed similar suits against the clerks of Valencia and San Miguel counties. After Ellins objected to Judge Martin, he recused himself and Judge Manuel I. Arrieta was assigned to the case on September 17, 2013. Economic effects In 2006, a study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law concluded that allowing same-sex couples to marry would have a positive effect on New Mexico's state budget. Allowing same-sex couples to marry would result in a net gain of approximately $1.5 million to $2 million each year for the state. This net impact will be the result of savings in expenditures on state means- tested public benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism. Demographics In April 2008, the Williams Institute of the UCLA School of Law, using data from the United States Census Bureau, issued a \\"Census Snapshot\\" that concluded: \\"While in many respects New Mexico's same-sex couples look like married couples, same-sex couples with children have fewer economic resources to provide for their families than married parents and lower rates of home ownership.\\" Analyzing census data on same-sex unmarried-partner households, the report determined that: *In 2000, there were 4,496 same-sex couples living in New Mexico. By 2005, the number of same-sex couples disclosing their partnerships to the census bureau had increased to 6,063. *In 2005, there were an estimated 68,411 gay, lesbian, and bisexual people (single and coupled) living in New Mexico. *There are more female same-sex couples (58%) than male same-sex couples (42%) in New Mexico. *Individuals in same-sex couples are, on average, 42 years old, and significantly younger than individuals in married couples (48 years old) in New Mexico. *Same-sex couples live in every county in New Mexico and constitute 1.2% of coupled households and 0.7% of all households in the state. *71% of individuals in same-sex couples are employed, compared to 60% of married individuals. *The average household income of same-sex couples is $53,720, compared to $59,692 for married couples. The median income of both same-sex and married coupled households in New Mexico is $47,000. *66% of same-sex couples in New Mexico own their home, compared to 83% of married couples. *27% of same-sex couples in New Mexico are raising children under the age of 18. *As of 2005, an estimated 3,624 of New Mexico's children were living in households headed by same-sex couples. *9% of New Mexico's adopted children (or 1,056 children) live with a lesbian or gay parent. Public opinion A June 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 42% of New Mexico voters thought that same-sex marriage should be legal, while 48% thought it should be illegal and 10% were not sure. A separate question in the same survey found that 68% of New Mexico voters supported the legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 37% supporting same-sex marriage, 31% supporting civil unions, 30% opposing all legal recognition, and 2% not sure. A December 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 45% of New Mexico voters thought that same-sex marriage should be legal, while 43% thought it should be illegal and 12% were not sure. A separate question in the same survey found that 67% of New Mexico voters supported the legal recognition of same- sex couples, with 42% supporting same-sex marriage, 25% supporting civil unions, 32% opposing all legal recognition, and 2% not sure. In a poll conducted by the Anzalone Liszt Grove Research for organizations backing the campaign \\"Why Marriage Matters New Mexico\\" between September 18‚Äì22, 2013, 51% of polled voters responded in favor of same-sex marriage with 42% opposed to the idea. The remaining 7 percent didn't know or refused to answer. The company surveyed 502 registered voters statewide by phone. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.4 percentage points. A March 2014 Public Policy Polling survey found that 47% of New Mexico voters thought that same-sex marriage should be legal, while 45% thought it should be illegal and 7% were not sure. A separate question in the same survey found that 74% of New Mexico voters supported the legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 45% supporting same- sex marriage, 29% supporting civil unions, 24% opposing all legal recognition, and 2% not sure. A February 2015 Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) survey found that 58% of New Mexicans supported same-sex marriage, while 34% remained opposed. A 2017 PRRI poll found that 63% of New Mexico residents supported same-sex marriage, while 30% opposed it and 7% were unsure.PRRI: American Values Atlas 2017 See also * LGBT rights in New Mexico * Same-sex marriage in the United States References External links *Links to PDF copies of court documents relating to the 2004 Sandoval County same-sex marriages *Opinion issued by Attorney General Gary K.

It is a key concept in the Vajrayana traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and has a variety of meanings. Lung is a concept that is particularly important to understandings of the subtle body and the Three Vajras (body, speech and mind). Traditional Tibetan medicine practitioner Dr Tamdin Sither Bradley provides a summary: Usages Some of the different usages of the term lung include: * the psychic winds (sanskrit: prana) that travel in the internal channels, or nadi (Sanskrit) of the subtle body and are manipulated in certain Vajrayana yoga practices. * specifically the five psychic winds that are a manifestation of the mahƒÅbh≈´ta. These five are the lifeforce that animate the bodymind (Sanskrit: namarupa) of all sentient beings and are key to certain tantric Buddhist and Bon sƒÅdhanƒÅs and traditional Tibetan medicine. * to the vayu and prana of ayurveda. * as a component of the term for a type of prayer flag, named after the allegorical Wind Horse (Tibet: lung ta). * a type of tantric buddhist empowerment that involves the transference of spiritual power from master to augment or refine that of the disciple through the recitation of scripture or song. This oracular transmission received aurally defines Vajrayana and Ngagpa traditions and provides them with their nomenclature. * the \\"reading transmission\\" of sutrayana texts, in which the entirety of the text is read aloud from teacher to student. Traditional Tibetan medicine The text being read during an empowerment ceremony - the 'lung' Traditional Tibetan medicine, a discipline practiced throughout the Himalayas, identifies a system of 'The Five Lung' which help to regulate the human body: *'Life-grasping lung' (srog 'dzin rlung) is located in the brain. This lung regulates swallowing, inhalation, spitting, eructation, sneezing, and generally clearing the senses and steadying of the mind and concentration. *'Upward moving lung' (gyen-rgyu rlung) is located in the thorax. This lung regulates speech, energy to work, body weight, memory, the increase of bodily vigour and health, complexion and the skin lustre, mental endeavour and diligence. *'All pervading lung' (khyab- byed rlung) is located is in the heart. This lung regulates lifting, walking, stretching and the contraction of muscles: opening and closing of the mouth, eyelids, anus etc. *'Fire accompanying lung' (me-mnyam rlung) is located is in the stomach and abdomen area. This lung regulates digestion and the metabolism. This lung also ripens the Seven Bodily Sustainers (Tibetan: lus- zung dhun). *'Downward cleansing lung' (thur-sel rlung) is located in the rectum, gastrointestinal tract and perineal region and its function is to expel feces, urine, semen, menstruation, uterine contractions and the fetus. This is also considered as \\"enjoyment lung\\" by most of the sublime practices of Vajrayana. (direct transmission is to be required by a qualified teacher) Subtle Body Tibetan Buddhism views the human body as consisting of a coarse body made of six constituent elements of earth, water, fire, wind, space and consciousness and also of a subtle body, or 'Vajra body', of winds, channels and drops. There are many types of wind or 'subtle breath' that move along the invisible channels of the subtle body. The 'vital breath' (Tibetan:sog lung ) is considered the most important. It is \\"the essence of life itself that animates and sustains all living beings\\". Anuttarayoga Tantra practices from the Mahamudra meditation system, such as GuhyasamƒÅja, Cakrasa·πÉvara and Hevajra tantras, provide various methods to penetrate the vital points of the Subtle Body. The 14th Dalai Lama summarises the practice: \\"To penetrate these points means to gather there the energy-winds and the subtle minds that ride on them, basically by means of different types of absorbed concentration focused on these spots.\\". Practices that work with the subtle energy winds includes tummo or 'Inner Fire', one of the Six Yogas of Naropa. In this practice, the yogin or yogini uses breathing and meditation techniques to draw the lung or subtle winds into the central channel and hold them there, traversing the body vertically. Tsa Lung A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels as well as five chakras. Tsalung (Skt: nadi-vayu; Tib. rtsa rlung; where \\"rtsa\\" denotes an energetic channel) are special yogic exercises.Wangyal, Tenzin (2002) p.89 Healing with Form, Energy, and Light. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. The exercises are used in the Bon tradition and the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Trul khor employs the tsa lung and they constitute the internal yantra or sacred architecture of this yoga's Sanskrit name, yantra yoga. Tsa lung are also employed in generation stage practices. The exercises are used: * to open major chakras and * to bring the lung from the side channels into the central channel.Wangyal, Tenzin (2002) p.82 Healing with Form, Energy, and Light. Ithaca, New York: Snow Lion Publications. That coincides with mind releasing dualistic misperceptions and abiding in non-dual awareness of rigpa (Tib. rig pa). Detailed instructions on the exercises describe 3 levels of rtsa rlung: external, internal and secret. Each level contains 5 exercises corresponding to five elements.Wangyal, Tenzin (2002) p.76-110 Healing with Form, Energy, and Light.

Built by bicycle-maker Paul Cornu, it was an open-framework structure built around a curved steel tube that carried a rotor at either end, and the engine and pilot in the middle. Power was transmitted to the rotors by a drive belt that linked both rotors and spun them in opposite directions. Control was to be provided by cables that could alter the pitch of the rotor blades, and by steerable vanes at either end of the machine intended to direct the downwash of the rotors. The Cornu helicopter is reported to have made a number of short hops, rising perhaps 1.5 or 2 metres (5‚Äì7 feet) into the air and staying aloft for something less than one minute. This was long enough for Cornu to learn that the control systems he had designed were ineffective, and he abandoned the machine soon thereafter. Modern engineering analyses have demonstrated that the Cornu helicopter could not have been capable of sustained flight. Nevertheless, in order to commemorate the centenary of his achievement, a replica of the helicopter was constructed by the √âcole sup√©rieure des techniques a√©ronautiques et de construction automobile (ESTACA) and presented to the Mus√©e de l'Air et de l'Espace where it was placed on display on 15 December 2007.

It lies within the boundaries of M-84 (Bay Road) to the west, Tittabawassee Road to the north, Fashion Square Blvd. to the east, and Schust Road to the south. The mall serves the city of Saginaw, its suburbs, and the greater Great Lakes Bay Region . It features more than 100 tenants, including a food court, and its anchor stores are JCPenney and Macy's. History Fashion Square Mall opened in 1972 with JCPenney and Sears as its major anchor stores. Hudson's, a chain based in Detroit, Michigan, was added in 1976 to the eastern end, as a third major anchor. The mall also included branches of two local department stores: William C. Wiechmann Company and Heavenrich's, the former of which was liquidated in 1992. In 1981, the mall was part of a lawsuit involving the lease of a Big Boy restaurant which operated within. CBL Properties bought the mall from its developer, Richard E. Jacobs Group, in 2000. A$10 million mall- wide renovation was completed in 2001, with the addition of new seating areas, family restrooms, and automatic doors. The same year, reflecting nameplate consolidation by Hudson's parent Target Corp., the mall's eastern anchor was re-branded as Marshall Field's, and by 2006, Marshall Field's would be among several nameplates to be converted to the Macy's name. Dunham's Sports also moved out in the 2000s, with Steve & Barry's taking its place in 2005. Steve & Barry's closed in December 2008 after the chain declared bankruptcy. McDonald's closed its food court location in January 2009, as did a Garfield's restaurant in May, only six months after opening in a space vacated by Ruby Tuesday.

As the USAC/CART split continued that year, Miller made two more champ car starts, this time on the dirt oval events that had become a part of the USAC \\"Gold Crown\\" Championship, with finishes of 9th and 19th.

The term didactic is used because this kind of influence is unidirectional; each individual instance of didactic organisation between two connected neurons does not involve a bidirectional transfer of connectivity or response property information between them. Experimental and theoretical evidence Evidence for didactic organisation in vivo was first discovered through research into synaptic reorganisation in primary visual cortex that compared the results of neuronal recording experiments and computational models.Young et al., 2007 However, the tendency of spike-timing-dependent plasticity to separate neurons into ‚Äòteachers‚Äô and ‚Äòstudents‚Äô had previously been predicted in theory based on computational modelling results alone.Song and Abbott, 2001 Spike-timing-dependent plasticity Didactic organisation is primarily a consequence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity, because when the neurons within an interconnected network undergo action potentials (or ‚Äòspikes‚Äô) at approximately the same time (within the order of tens of milliseconds) the efferent synaptic connections of neurons that spike early will have their efficacy increased (long-term potentiation), while neurons that spike late will have the efficacy of their efferent synaptic connections decreased (long-term depression). Causal activity While spike-timing- dependent plasticity is an essential ingredient for didactic organisation, other features of neuronal activity appear to be required for didactic organisation to occur in vivo. One of these features is that activity propagated through a network needs to have a 'causal' character. For example, chain of reciprocally connected neurons with this ‚Äòcausal activity‚Äô characteristic would be capable of propagating a wave of spikes along its length, rather than the wave disintegrating into a cascade of spikes ‚Äòbouncing‚Äô back and forth between neurons in the chain. Activity propagation A third important feature for didactic organisation in vivo concerns the spatial scale of spike propagation within a network. While it is expected that didactic organisation will always be present among neurons that exhibit spike timing-dependent plasticity and causal activity (see above), the spatial scale over which didactic organisation can occur between neurons within a network should be limited by the spatial scale of spike propagation. Evidence suggests that the scale of spike propagation can be actively controlled by adjusting the balance of excitation and inhibition within a network (a balance that can be modulated by synaptic scaling, for example), thus providing a means by which a network can actively control when and to what extent didactic organisation can occur. For this reason, and the very specific connectivity patterns that can be achieved via didactic organisation, it has been speculated that didactic organisation may play an important role in brain development.

Castellanos obtained his Medical Degree from the University of Havana School of Medicine in 1925. He was a pediatrician, radiologist and cardiologist who was a pioneer in the field of angiocardiography.http://ishrad.org/historical-archive/gallery-of- innovators/early-days/pioneers-in-south-and-central-america His initial work was with dogs and cadavers before extending this method to humans. Castellanos and colleagues published the first important paper on the clinical applications of intravenous angiocardiography which was published in the Archivos de la Sociedad de Estudios Clinicos in 1937. This is believed the first publication which dealt with the normal cardiac structure and the changes seen in ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis (Doby, 1976). A year later they pioneered the method of retrograde injection of dye (Perabrodil) into the aorta which was mainly used to diagnose patent ductus arteriosus (Castellanos and Pereira, 1938). Castellanos expanded his work on angiocardiography to include the study of the various congenital malformations of the heart. He also was involved in the development of the procedure known as pneumomediastinum and in multiple investigations involving hematology and infectious diseases. Castellanos was recognized in Cuba with the establishment at the Children's Hospital in Havana of the Agust√≠n W. Castellanos Foundation for Cardiovascular Research. Internationally he was honored by many societies of pediatric and adult cardiology, radiology and pediatrics. He has been honored in Mexico City with inclusion in the mural honoring the \\"Great Men of Cardiology\\" by the famous Mexican artist Diego Rivera located in the Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog√≠a. Castellanos was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize twice. In 1959 and 1960, Ecuador and Colombia nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology, respectively. Castellanos immigrated to Miami, Florida, in 1960. He maintained a busy private practice and was a clinical and visiting Professor of Pediatrics at the University Of Miami School Of Medicine, Senior Scientist at the National Children's Cardiac Hospital as well as Acting Chief of Pediatric Cardiology at Variety Children's Hospital. Throughout his career, he authored or coauthored 327 scientific articles. Castellanos died on December 7, 2000, in Miami, Florida.

The march began late on the night of 30 May 1945 when the ethnic German minority in Brno was expelled to nearby Austria. Only about half of expellees actually crossed the border. Thousands of people were held in the provisional camps in the border area. While some Germans were later allowed to return to Brno, hundreds of others fell victim to diseases and malnutrition in the following weeks. The number of fatalities caused by the march and imprisonment is disputed as it became part of propaganda: the estimates range between 500 and 8,000.  Background  =Liberation of Brno= After six years of German occupation the city of Brno, capital of the Czechoslovak province Moravia, was liberated on April 26, 1945 by the Soviet and Romanian armies of 2nd Ukrainian Front, in the context of the Bratislava‚ÄìBrno Offensive. The next day, the Nazi German administration of the city was abolished and replaced by newly created and Czech-led N√°rodn√≠ v√Ωbor mƒõsta Brna (\\"People's Committee of the City of Brno\\"). While at the beginning of 1945 there were about 58,000 Germans registered in the city, most them were evacuated before the fighting reached the city or fled on their own in fear of the Red Army. After the liberation the N√°rodn√≠ v√Ωbor registered about 26,000 people considered as Germans. Shortly after, the Germans were marked with white armbands and became subject to similar restrictions previously directed against the Jews by the Nazis. =Prelude to expulsion= Shortly after the war had ended, the Czechoslovak government incited the expulsion of its large ethnic German minority from the country. Over half a million people were forced to march to the German and Austrian borders and thousands were killed. During May 1945 the N√°rodn√≠ v√Ωbor several times discussed the need to punish Nazi war criminals, their Czech collaborators and the general situation of Germans in the city. About 1,500 people were arrested, most of them Germans. On 23 May the N√°rodn√≠ v√Ωbor of Brno urged the Czechoslovak government to immediately establish courts for such criminals, because the people in Brno were rioting in front of the prison in an attempt to lynch the prisoners. Moreover, there was severe housing shortage in Brno as a consequence of the combat and previous bombings. In particular, factory workers demanded confiscation of the apartments of the Germans, as the Germans had done with the apartments of the Jews. On May 30, 1945 the Zemsk√Ω n√°rodn√≠ v√Ωbor (\\"Provincial National Committee\\"), which resided in Brno, issued its order No. 78/1945, which ordered the immediate expulsion of the non-working German population from Brno. All women, boys under the age of 14 and men over the age of 60 should leave the city immediately, and the working men after they had been replaced in their work. On the morning of 30 May the representatives of the large firearm factory in Brno urged the police director to fulfill this order immediately. They also offered armed men from the factory to assist. In order to select the particular Germans to be expelled, police used a rationing system which was originally introduced by Germans at the Invasion of Poland and which also allocated food to the recipients by race and ethnicity .  The march  At around 6 pm on 29 May 1945, police and assistance troops started to gather all recipients of food coupons marked with a \\"D\\" (for Germans) and at around 10 pm on 30 May the first groups of Germans were forced to march south towards the Austrian border. According to police reports, 18,072 Germans were expelled. In the middle of the night the group reached the town of Rajhrad about from Brno, where most of those expelled spent the rest of the night in the orphanage. While the Sudeten German propaganda later claimed thousands of people were killed on the march or in Rajhrad and \\"the road was paved with corpses\\", there are only 3 confirmed deaths (2 of them violent). As of 2015, none of the alleged mass graves has been found along the road. The next morning the group reached the small town of Poho≈ôelice, further south. Next to the town was an abandoned concentration camp in which the Germans of Brno were interned. The next day, 1 June, many people were too exhausted, so the guards selected approximately 10,000 people still able to walk and escorted them to the Austrian border near Mikulov. At the time, the representatives of Austria in Brno as well as Soviet occupation authorities in Austria had already protested against this unarranged transfer of large numbers of people, and persuaded the Czechoslovak government to stop the expulsion. About half of the expellees thus remained in the camp of Poho≈ôelice.  Poho≈ôelice camp  = History of the camp in Poho≈ôelice = The town of Poho≈ôelice had a large German minority and after the Munich agreement it became part of the Third Reich. After the outbreak of the war a small camp for prisoners of war was established near the town. In 1944 it became a concentration camp for Hungarian Jews who were used for the hardest work. The Jews were liberated by the Red Army in the middle of April 1945 and the then empty camp was used to accommodate the Germans of Brno, whose number by far exceeded the camp's capacity. = Living conditions = Since the Austrian authorities refused to accept any people before their Austrian origin was proven and since the Czech authorities in Brno considered the return of Germans to Brno as politically unacceptable, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior decided that the group of approximately 10,000 Germans had to stay in Poho≈ôelice and surrounding villages, where significant German minorities were already accommodated. As the Poho≈ôelice camp was abandoned more than a month before, there was no opportunity to provide proper housing, food and health care for thousands of people. Not until 5 June was proper camp administration established and regular food supply provided. At this time, an epidemic of dysentery (shigellosis) broke out. According to official records, 455 dead were buried near the town of Poho≈ôelice, mostly victims of diseases. Sudeten German sources, however, estimated that between 1,300-8,000 people either died of disease or were murdered.Rozumƒõt dƒõjin√°m, Zdenƒõk Bene≈°, p. 209 Later in June, the camp inmates were better identified and approximately 2,000-2,500 were selected and allowed to return to Brno, most of whom had Czech origin or Czech relatives in Brno. Once the news about their return spread into the city, police reported a new wave of anti-German protests. About 1,000 expellees were accommodated by families of surrounding villages, and 1,807 mostly elderly people were relocated to the former Institute for Juvenile in Mu≈°lov next to Mikulov. Hundreds of individuals with German or Austrian citizenship were allowed to go to Austria. Others were sent to other camps in Brno and Svatobo≈ôice. The camp in Poho≈ôelice was officially dissolved on 7 July 1945. At this time, there were still about 80 Germans from Brno in Poho≈ôelice, about 60 of them were sick people in provisory hospital.  Casualties  Because of the quick improvised course of events, the exact number of casualties is very difficult to state. The estimates vary widely and have become a source of political disputes and propaganda. Austrian researchers found 1,950 victims of the march itself, 2,000 victims in the Poho≈ôelice camp and 190 victims in surrounding villages. In total 4,140 German victims from Brno plus 1,062 who died in Austria.[Stanƒõk Tom√°≈°: Pov√°leƒçn√© \\"excesy\\" v ƒçesk√Ωch zem√≠ch v roce 1945 a jejich vy≈°et≈ôov√°n√≠, Praha 2005. In: Brnƒõnsk√Ω pochod smrti - Kate≈ôina Tuƒçkov√°: M√© brnƒõnsk√© Sudety, s. 31-45] German sources regard the later communist police officer Bed≈ôich Pokorn√Ω as responsible of organizing the √öst√≠ massacre of hundreds of ethnic Germans on 31 July 1945. There have been attempts to confirm statements that Pokorn√Ω had thousands of people executed. Emilia Hrabovec was unable to substantiate these charges but instead, according to her research, old people and tired young children had been sent away on trucks under supervision of Czechoslovak guards. According to official death records from 1945, 455 people from Brno died and were buried in Poho≈ôelice (near the town), 129 in Mu≈°lov, 65 in villages surrounding the town of Poho≈ôelice. In total 649 victims originally expulsed from Brno died on Czech territory. Remembrance In 1995 Czech writer Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k filed criminal charge for the crime of genocide related to the event of expulsion of Germans from Brno. Czech police however did not find evidence for such crime as there were only 3 confirmed violent deaths (two on the march and one later in Mu≈°lov). In 2000 a group of young Czech students called for an adequate way to remember the events in Brno. In 2015 the council of Brno officially regretted the harm on the victims of the death march and organized a \\"Pilgrimage of Reconciliation\\" along the route.Ein Meilenstein: Br√ºnn erinnert an Vertreibung Tagesspiegel, May 28, 2015 Br√ºnn bedauert Vertreibung der Sudetendeutschen Sueddeutsche Zeitung, May 20, 2015 In 2002, a joint commission of German and Czech historians collected evidence and published the results in a book titled Rozumƒõt dƒõjin√°m (\\"Understanding History\\"). In 2007 a group of young people organized a night Memorial March from Brno to Poho≈ôelice to commemorate the event. At the first time, only three people participated in the march and in the following years about 20-30 people attended.

It is famous for being No√´l Coward's first publicly produced musical work and for the use of a 3-D stereoscopic shadowgraph as part of its opening act. The revue's song \\"Parisian Pierrot\\", sung by Gertrude Lawrence, was Coward's first big hit and became one of his signature tunes. Background and productions The basis of London Calling! began at the Swiss resort of Davos in Christmas 1922, when Coward presented a musical outline of a new revue project involving himself and Gertrude Lawrence, to benefactor Lord Lathom, who was also a friend of Andr√© Charlot.The History of Lathom Lathom had liked it and approached Charlot to produce it. Charlot's West End musical production Rats, which premiered on 21 February 1923 at the Vaudeville Theatre, also starred Lawrence. At first Charlot did not have Coward in mind to perform in London Calling!, but Coward used his contractual right of veto to turn down all other suggestions for leading man. Charlot gave way and paid him a wage of ¬£40 a week with the success of the show.Morley, Sheridan. Coward, p. 27, Haus, 2005 ¬£40 in 1923 would equate to at least ¬£1,600 in 2007 terms measuringworth.com The revue featured 25 sketches, skits, songs and dance routines, with choreographic assistance by Fred Astaire who was working in London's Shaftesbury Theatre with his sister Adele at the time. Astaire taught Coward tap-dancing at the nearby Guildhall School of Music.New Theatre Quarterly, 39:37 ISSN 0266-464X Though a leading lady in West End plays, Lawrence made her singing debut with Coward's musical works, an association that would continue throughout their careers. Lawrence had previously worked with him on the Liverpool production of Gerhart Hauptmann's play Hannele in 1913.Day, Barry (ed.) The Letters of Noel Coward. (Page 34) Random House, 2007 The revue sketches made light of London society at the time, with one sketch called \\"The Swiss Family Whittlebot\\" poking fun at The Sitwells, known for their avant-garde poetry and ideas.Morley, Sheridan. Coward. (Page 29) Haus, 2005 The revue was directed by Herbert Mason; it opened at the Duke of York's Theatre on 4 September 1923 and ran for 367 performances. Charlot was developing a new production entitled Andr√© Charlot's London Revue of 1924 and had replaced Lawrence with singer Joyce Barbour in January 1924, at which point the production was nearing the end of its 5-month run.

American inventor Hammond had earlier developed a Teleview sequential viewing system for use as part of the successful productions of the Ziegfeld Follies (1907‚Äì1931). Its use influenced producer Andr√© Charlot, who was in the United States at the time of the Follies, to attempt something similar in Europe.

As of June 2020, Phase-1 construction is set to commence by the end of 2020 and will be complete by 2025. History The Ganga Expressway project was firstly launched in 2007 by then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati. The project aims to construct a 1047 km access controlled eight-lane expressway running along the Ganga River. This expressway will connect Greater Noida to Ballia, ensuring high speed connectivity between the Eastern and Western boundaries of Uttar Pradesh. The proposed expressway from Ballia to Greater Noida is also planned to serve as a flood control embankment since floods are a major cause of agricultural and environmental damage in the area, and lead to many deaths as well as the spread of diseases during India's monsoon season. The expressway will connect major cities in the state of Uttar Pradesh, passing through Varanasi, Mirzapur, Allahabad, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Unnao, Kanpur, Kannauj, Farrukhabad, Shahjahanpur, Badaun, Bulandshahr. Construction work on Ganga Expressway was not started then because of an order from the Allahabad High Court. The order instructed that the state and the concessionaire complete a full environmental study and obtain permission from the central government before embarking on the construction. The project was revived again with a different alignment and total length in January 2019 by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The project comprises a 596 km Phase-1 from Meerut to Malawan Khurd village on Jhusi Sahson road in Prayagraj District, Phase-2 will consist of two sections, one 110 km long section connecting Tigri (near Garhmukteshwar) to Uttar Pradesh Uttrakhand Border near Haridwar and second 314 km connecting Prayagraj to Ballia.

The term neutropenic sepsis is also applied, although it tends to be reserved for patients who are less well. In 50% of cases, an infection is detectable; bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream) is present in approximately 20% of all patients with this condition. Causes Febrile neutropenia can develop in any form of neutropenia, but is most generally recognized as a complication of chemotherapy when it is myelosuppressive (suppresses the bone marrow from producing blood cells). Diagnosis =MASCC and CISNE risk indexes= The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index can be used to identify low-risk patients (score ‚â•21 points) for serious complications of febrile neutropenia (including death, intensive care unit admission, confusion, cardiac complications, respiratory failure, kidney failure, low blood pressure, bleeding, and other serious medical complications). The score was developed to select patients for therapeutic strategies that could potentially be more convenient or cost-effective. A prospective trial demonstrated that a modified MASCC score can identify patients with febrile neutropenia at low risk of complications, as well. In contrast, the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE) score is specific of patients with solid tumors and seemingly stable episodes. CISNE is able to discriminate groups of patients who are at low, intermediate, and high risk of complications in this population. With the CISNE, the complication rate was determined to be 1.1% for low-risk patients, 6.2% for intermediate- risk patients, and 36.0% for high-risk patients.Carmona-Bayonas, Alberto, et al. \\"Prediction of Serious Complications in Patients With Seemingly Stable Febrile Neutropenia: Validation of the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia in a Prospective Cohort of Patients From the FINITE Study.\\" Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015): JCO-2014. The prime purpose of this model was to avoid complications from an early hospital release. On the contrary, CISNE should not be used so much to select low-risk patients for outpatient treatment.Fonseca, Paula Jim√©nez, et al. \\"A nomogram for predicting complications in patients with solid tumours and seemingly stable febrile neutropenia.\\" British Journal of Cancer (2016): 1191-1198. Treatment Generally, patients with febrile neutropenia are treated with empirical antibiotics until the neutrophil count has recovered (absolute neutrophil counts greater than 500/mm3) and the fever has abated; if the neutrophil count does not improve, treatment may need to continue for two weeks or occasionally more. In cases of recurrent or persistent fever, an antifungal agent should be added. Guidelines issued in 2002 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend the use of particular combinations of antibiotics in specific settings; mild low-risk cases may be treated with a combination of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin, while more severe cases require cephalosporins with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (e.g. cefepime), or carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem). A subsequent meta-analysis published in 2006 found cefepime to be associated with more negative outcomes, and carbapenems (while causing a higher rate of pseudomembranous colitis) were the most straightforward in use. In 2010, updated guidelines were issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, recommending use of cefepime, carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin), or piperacillin/tazobactam for high-risk patients and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ciprofloxacin for low-risk patients. Patients who do not strictly fulfill the criteria of low- risk patients should be admitted to the hospital and treated as high-risk patients. Research to compare antibiotic treatments currently recommended in consensus guidelines identified 44 studies comparing different antibiotics. Significantly higher mortality was reported for Cefepime compared to all other antibiotics combined. Piperacillin‚Äêtazobactam resulted in lower mortality than other antibiotics. Piperacillin‚Äêtazobactam might be the preferred antibiotic for the treatment of cancer patients with fever and neutropenia, while cefepime should not be used. Empiric treatment should be started within 60 minutes of being admitted. Periodic monitoring should be done to see if the empiric treatment is working, or if a more target therapy should be initiated. In people with cancer who have febrile neutropoenia (excluding patients with acute leukaemia), oral treatment is an acceptable alternative to intravenous antibiotic treatment if they are haemodynamically stable, without organ failure, without pneumonia and with no infection of a central line or severe soft-tissue infection. Furthermore, outpatient treatment for low‚Äêrisk febrile neutropaenia in people with cancer probably makes little or no difference to treatment failure and mortality compared with the standard hospital (inpatient) treatment and may reduce time that patients need to be treated in hospital.

As establishing a set of clinical criteria for diagnosis of hemihyperplasia is difficult, the dictum is often used that the clinician should be able to see the asymmetry \\"from the end of the bed\\".ACMG Practice Guidelines, Diagnostic criteria and tumor screening for individuals with Isolated Hemihyperplasia, Carol L. Clericuzio, MD, and Rick A. Martin, MD, acmg.net Hemihyperplasia is seen in several congenital syndromes including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Russell-Silver syndrome. Hemihyperplasia is a congenital overgrowth disorder, and the asymmetry can range from mild to severe. Establishing a diagnosis is important because hemihyperplasia is associated with an increased risk for embryonal tumors, mainly Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma. Due to the heightened tumor risk, a tumor screening protocol is recommended for all children with isolated hemihyperplasia and Beckwith- Wiedemann Syndrome. Some of the other syndromes associated with hemihyperplasia may also follow this tumor-surveillance protocol. The recommended protocol is: #Any child with suspected isolated hemihyperplasia should be referred to a clinical geneticist for evaluation. #Abdominal ultrasound should be conducted every 3 months until 7 years old. #Serum alpha fetoprotein measurement should be done every 3 months until 4 years old. #Daily caretaker abdominal examination is at the discretion of the provider/parent.Ibid In some cases, children with hemihyperplasia may have different leg lengths. The two main surgical options for the treatment of uneven leg lengths are shortening and lengthening. Epiphysiodesis, which involves removing part of the growth plate of the longer leg, allowing the shorter leg to \\"catch up\\", may be performed on patients still able to grow. Bone resection is performed on patients who have no growth left and involves removing part of the bone. Leg lengthening procedures are more painful, involving the insertion of pins to be turned, moving parts of the bone apart (Ilizarov's method). This process is reserved mainly for patients with a discrepancy greater than 4 cm, although some leg lengthening procedures are now done cosmetically. Nonsurgical options include attachment of a lift to the shoe, allowing the patient to walk normally. Children with hemihypertrophy may also develop scoliosis, a curvature of the spine. Hemifacial hyperplasia is believed to be a minor form of hemihypertrophy.

The procedure, mostly used in combination with systemic chemotherapy, plays a role in the treatment of liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Although surgical resection remains the standard of care for these liver metastases, majority of patients have lesions that are unresectable. The liver derives its blood supply from two sources ‚Äì via the hepatic arterial circulation and the portal circulation. Liver metastases get most of their blood supply primarily from the hepatic artery, whereas the normal liver cells get their blood supply from the portal circulation. This allows for chemotherapeutic drugs to be delivered directly to the cancer cells if infused into the hepatic artery. Multiple trials have compared HAI (with various chemotherapeutic agents) to systemic chemotherapy. Compared to systemic Fluoropyrimidine, HAI with Floxuridine (FUDR) had an increased response, but there was no overall increase in patient survival. Efforts have been made to increase the efficacy and safety of HAI chemotherapy: when a combination of FUDR and dexamethasone was used for HAI, both response rate and median survival increased. In another study, a combination of FUDR and leucovorin for HAI increased the response rate, and reduced the biliary toxicity seen with the use of FUDR alone. Considering improvements in the surgical placement of the HAI pump and studies showing promising results when HAI therapy is used together with systemic oxaliplatin or irinotecan, there is once again an increased interest in the role of HAI as a treatment option in patients with cancer, who have unresectable CRC liver metastases. However, studies recommend that this treatment modality be restricted to centers with expertise in the surgical placement of these pumps, and the technical aspects of localized chemotherapy. Procedure Before the placement of the HAI pump, the patients undergo an arteriogram to outline the blood supply of the liver and to identify any anatomical anomalies. The procedure begins with an exploratory laparotomy to confirm the unresectable nature of the tumor, and then the gallbladder is removed by performing a cholecystectomy. This is done to prevent treatment induced cholecystitis. The distal gastroduodenal artery, the right gastric artery, and small branches supplying the stomach and duodenum are ligated. This total devascularization of the distal stomach and proximal duodenum minimizes the risk of any extra hepatic perfusion. The catheter is placed at the junction of the proper and common hepatic arteries, and threaded through the gastroduodenal (mostly), or celiac artery. The catheter is fixed in this position and the pump is placed in a subcutaneous pocket. Finally, to confirm adequate placement and hepatic perfusion, and to rule out extrahepatic perfusion, a dye (fluorescein or methylene blue) is injected into the pump. After the procedure and before starting the HAI based treatment, a technetium 99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin scan is performed to again confirm adequate hepatic perfusion and no misperfusion outside of the liver. Complications The complications of HAI therapy can be divided into those related to the surgical placement of the pump, technical catheter-related complications, and those related to the chemotherapeutic agents used. Relating to the surgical HAI pump placement, early postoperative complications consist of arterial injury leading to hepatic artery thrombosis, inadequate perfusion of the entire liver due to the inability to identify an accessory hepatic artery, extrahepatic perfusion to the stomach or duodenum, or hematoma formation in the subcutaneous pump pocket. Late complications are more common and include inflammation or ulceration of the stomach or duodenum, and pump pocket infection. The most common catheter related complications include displacement of the catheter, occlusion of the hepatic artery because of the catheter, and catheter thrombosis. These catheter related complications don‚Äôt occur as frequently with increased surgical experience and with improvements in pump design. The most common toxicities caused by the chemotherapeutic agents were gastrointestinal symptoms, chemical hepatitis, and bone marrow inhibition. It is important to note that the most serious and dose limiting complication of HAI is hepatobiliary toxicity. This occurs more commonly with FUDR than any other chemotherapeutic agent. Patients undergoing HAI therapy therefore have regular liver function tests to monitor any damage to the liver. As previously mentioned, studies have been carried out to come up with treatment algorithms to minimize this serious side effect. It has been shown that adding leucovorin and FUDR for infusion through the pump not only reduces the biliary toxicity of the drug, but also increases the response rate. However, biliary sclerosis is not seen with HAI using 5-FU. 5-FU is associated with an increased risk of myelosuppression. Logically, it would make sense to therefore consider alternating between HAI FUDR and HAI 5-FU.

It is a complication of high-dose chemotherapy given before a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and/or excessive exposure to hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. It is classically marked by weight gain due to fluid retention, increased liver size, and raised levels of bilirubin in the blood. The name sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is preferred if VODI happens as a result of chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. Apart from chemotherapy, VODI may also occur after ingestion of certain plant alkaloids such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids (in some herbal teas), and has been described as part of a rare hereditary disease called hepatic venoocclusive disease with immunodeficiency (which results from mutations in the gene coding for a protein called SP110). Signs and symptoms Features of VODI include weight gain, tender enlargement of the liver, ascites, and yellow discoloration of the skin; it often is associated with acute kidney failure. Pathophysiology In the bone marrow transplant setting, VODI is felt to be due to injury to the hepatic venous endothelium from the conditioning regimen.Toxic agents causing veno-occlusive disease include plants as well as the medication cyclophosphamide. Diagnosis Doppler ultrasound of the liver is typically utilized to confirm or suggest the diagnosis. Common findings on liver doppler ultrasound include increased phasicity of portal veins with eventual development of portal flow reversal. The liver is usually enlarged but maintained normal echogenicity. A liver biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment Treatment generally includes supportive care including pain management and possibly diuretics. In those with severe disease due to a bone marrow transplant, defibrotide is a proposed treatment. It has been approved for use in severe cases in Europe and the United States. A placebo controlled trial, however, has not been done as of 2016. Prognosis Mild disease has a risk of death of about 10% while moderate disease has a risk of death of 20%. When it occurs as a result of bone marrow transplant and multiorgan failure is present, the risk of death is greater than 80%. History The first report on veno-occlusive disease, in 1920, was as a result of senecio poisoning in South Africa. Subsequent reports were mostly in Jamaicans who had consumed herbal teas. With the advent of bone marrow transplantation, most cases since its introduction have been in those undergoing treatment for leukemia.

NBC played the theme 12,000 times during their run. Tesh came up with the melody while at a hotel and called his answering machine at home to sing a preliminary version of the melody so he would not forget it. A more rock-oriented variant was introduced in 1997 to coincide with the debut of the WNBA. That theme was also used until 2002, and on NBC's WNBA telecasts only. Appearances after 2002 When ABC took over broadcasting rights for the National Basketball Association (NBA) from NBC, Tesh offered them the rights to also use his theme, but they declined and chose to compose their own theme music instead. The theme is still memorable three decades later, especially because of its association with the NBA's ascendance in the 1990s. The tune was revived in three ways in 2008 and 2016, with NBC using the music for commercial bumpers and starting lineup announcements during their coverage of basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Olympics that featured NBA players and Tesh releasing a free MP3 version on his website to commemorate the 2008 NBA Finals. This theme was sampled by Nelly for his song \\"Heart of a Champion\\" from his studio album, Sweat, and compilation album Sweatsuit. \\"Roundball Rock\\" was also used in The Boondocks episode \\"Ballin'\\". On April 13, 2013, Saturday Night Live parodied John Tesh pitching the theme to NBC Sports executives. In this sketch, the tune featured comical lyrics sung by John's fictional brother Dave. A re-recording of the tune is used by Tesh as theme music for his syndicated radio show, as well as for the television series Intelligence for Your Life that Tesh co-hosts with his wife Connie Sellecca. On September 17, 2017, NBC briefly played the tune heading into a commercial break during a Sunday Night Football game, over a replay of a jump shot-themed touchdown celebration by Atlanta Falcons players Devonta Freeman and Andy Levitre. On September 11, 2020, TNT played \\"Heart of a Champion\\" going into a commercial break, during Game 7 of an Eastern Conference Semifinals series between the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics. Usage by Fox Sports Fox Sports announced in December 2018 that it had acquired the rights to \\"Roundball Rock\\", which it will play for CBB on FOX. CBB on FS1 had used their old theme (a \\"marching band\\" variant of the NFL on FOX theme), the same one as CFB on FOX/FS1, but switched to this theme for the 2019-20 college basketball season.

He had a forty year career that peaked in the 1940s and '50s. Many of his compositions use extended chord harmonies, polyphony, and polytonality and were influenced by Stravinsky, Bart√≥k, and Hindemith.  Early career  Miller was born in East Chicago, Indiana. At an early age he learned banjo and played it in the high school band. At sixteen he joined the Musicians Union and began to play professionally. In 1927 he switched to guitar, performing mostly dixieland with bands in Indiana and Michigan. He moved to Chicago in the early 1930s and worked as a drummer and string bassist. At this time he started experimenting with the vibraphone. He worked with bands around Chicago, playing guitar, piano, and vibes, including with pianist Frank Melrose and drummer Dave Tough. He went on tour as a guitarist and vibraphonist for the Vincent Lopez Orchestra with Betty Hutton as vocalist. In 1937, at age 26, he left Lopez to become musical director at WIND radio in Chicago, where he stayed for two years, performing 21 live shows a week, often his compositions.  Work with Anita O'Day  In 1939 he performed at Carl Cons' Off Beat Club with Anita O'Day as vocalist. He is credited as hiring O'Day for her first singing job. This is documented in her autobiography, High Times/Hard Times. They worked together again in 1948, including the Rag Doll in Chicago, the Continental in Milwaukee, the Flame in St. Paul, again in Chicago in 1949, and in other clubs during the 1950s. In a 1958 interview she said, \\"My musical co-worker since 1939. To me, Max Miller is the swingin' end. I'd love to do an album with Max.\\" Meeting Bechet His quintet performed at the Three Deuces club in 1940 until the club burned down later that year. Alto saxophonist Johnny Bothwell was a member of the group. He became musical director for the Boyd Raeburn Band. In 1943 he co-led a quartet with trumpeter Shorty Sherock that included Jimmy Raney on guitar. His first recording sessions with Sidney Bechet were in 1944 and included Tony Parenti on clarinet, Zilner Randolph on trumpet, Bill Funkey on alto and tenor sax, and Ken Smith on drums. Billboard magazine's December 15, 1945 issue reviewed Miller's concert with Bechet and Parenti. Miller met Bechet in 1944 when he, Smith, and Paul Edward Miller traveled to Springfield to hear Bechet perform. They sat in with the band into the night. Miller became friends with Bechet, and they recorded together. In 1945 he became the first jazz musician to perform at Chicago's Orchestra Hall, primarily presenting his compositions, with Muggsy Spanier part of his group. On October 13, 1946 he performed in a concert presented by Green Recordings at the Civic Opera House as pianist for the Dizzy Gillespie Quintet, the Sidney Bechet Sextet, and his trio. The concert featured Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland. and George Barnes. During Bechet's visit to Chicago, Miller booked time in Bachman Studios on Carmen Avenue and recorded private sessions with him. In 1947 he spent a year and a half working in California, with engagements at the Swanee Inn, the Red Feather, Angelino's, and the Haig. He returned to Chicago to perform at the Blue Note, then worked in Milwaukee and Minneapolis.  1950s  In 1950 he recorded at least six songs for Life Record Company. This was primarily original material that he had performed at the Orchestra Hall concert, including \\"Heartbeat Blues\\", \\"Sunny Disposition\\", \\"Fantasia of the Unconscious\\", and \\"Lumbar Ganglion Jump\\". In 1951 Columbia released an album of Miller playing jazz standards as part of its \\"Piano Moods\\" series. He was backed by Earl Backus on guitar, Bill Holyoke on bass, and Remo Belli (of Remo Drum heads) on drums. In 1952, he returned to Life Records, recording at least four more sides before the company closed. He recorded for Gold Seal Records in the 1950s. He signed to a five-year contract with MCA, but he bought his way out when he learned he would lose the rights to his material. In 1953 he performed with Bechet. One of their concerts was at the Kimball Hall in Chicago with Miller on piano, Bechet on soprano saxophone, Bill Harris on trombone, and Sid Catlett on drums. The 1954 American Peoples Encyclopedia Yearbook called their reunion the highlight of the year. Miller continued to record in his studios. He received equipment from top companies due to his column \\"The Audio Workshop\\" in DownBeat magazine. He recorded with Bill Harris and Chubby Jackson and compiled many live recordings due to his club dates and concerts. Benny Goodman chose Miller as vibraphonist for the \\"Pace of Chicago\\" television show filmed at the Garrick Theater in April 1952. Miller shared the bill of the Paris Club Revue with jazz singer Joe Williams and trumpeter King Kolax. In 1956 he opened his club, \\"Max Miller's Scene\\" in the 2100 block on N. Clark St. in Chicago at the site of the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. He formed a duo with violinist Eddie South and performed with violinist Stuff Smith. He shared billing with Mel Torme and then with Oscar Pettiford. At the Blue Note in Chicago, he played intermission piano opposite the Woody Herman Band. He worked with Coleman Hawkins at the Panther Room in Chicago as members of Paul Jordan's band. In 1959 he was at London House with Bobby Hackett for two weeks.  Death  Max Miller died in Shawnee, Oklahoma in 1985 four days before his 74th birthday after a long fight with congestive heart failure. Awards and honors In 1940, Down Beat magazine listed him at number 20 in the Small Combos category. He was mentioned in Esquire's 1944 Jazz Book and was compared to Lionel Hampton and Red Norvo. In 1945 he was No. 2 in the Esquire All American Band New Stars category for vibraharp. In 1946 he listed seventh among pianists in Esquire, under Erroll Garner and above Count Basie, James P. Johnson, and Jay McShann. He won the Esquire New Star poll by Earl Hines and Red Norvo. He placed in the Top Ten of the Other Instruments category for vibes. These poll standings are from Esquire's 1946 Jazz Book. Studs Terkel called him \\"The Angry Man of Jazz\\", saying that he demanded rather than coaxed certain sounds from his instruments. Record producer John H. Hammond called him an \\"astonishing artist, second only to Lionel Hampton in proficiency\\". Paul Edward Miller (no relation), former music critic, writer, and editor of Esquire Jazz Books, called Miller \\"a champion of good jazz\\".

In Vietnam the species, prized in herbal medicine, is commercially very valuable and now considered threatened. Description Panax vietnamensis is a perennial plant, growing from to tall. It may be distinguished from other ginseng species by the notches on its roots. Distribution and habitat In Vietnam, P. vietnamensis is found primarily in the Mount Ng·ªçc Linh area of Kon Tum and Qu·∫£ng Nam provinces, from which its local name is derived. It is also found in the Mount Ng·ªçc Lum Heo and Mount Ng·ªçc Am areas of Qu·∫£ng Nam Province. Its habitat is areas under jungle leaf canopy or near running water, at altitudes above . The species is also reported from central and southern provinces of China. Threats Panax vietnamensis faces a number of threats to its survival as a species in Vietnam. With increased demand from the herbal medicine industry, locals have over-harvested the plant in the wild. The species is slow-growing, taking around 10 years to reach maturity. Larger-scale commercial farming operations have been affected by theft of the plants. False ginseng seeds have been introduced to the Mount Ng·ªçc Linh area in an attempt to be grown and sold as P. vietnamensis. The introduced strains mature in a much shorter time and can be grown at lower altitudes. Scientists are concerned that these strains may mix with and compromise purebred P. vietnamensis.

Libya claimed that the entire Gulf was their territory, at 32¬∞ 30' N, with an exclusive fishing zone. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi asserted this in 1973, and dubbed it \\"The Line of Death\\". The United States claimed its rights to conduct naval operations in international waters, a standard of territorial limit from a country's shore. The engagement followed the 1981 Gulf of Sidra incident and preceded another incident in 1989. Background Tensions between the United States and Libya heightened after the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 on 14 June 1985, and the Rome and Vienna airport attacks on 27 December, that same year. The United States claimed that the Libyan leader was involved in these actions through his support of the alleged perpetrator, Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal. At the same time Libya began the installation of SA-5 surface-to-air missile batteries and radars they received from the Soviet Union in late 1985, to bolster their air defense. As the United States Navy had done for several years, they continued to challenge Libya's claim to the Gulf of Sidra by crossing the so-called \\"Line of Death.\\" Following the terrorist attacks in Rome and Vienna, the U.S. Navy began several \\"Freedom of Navigation\\" operations in the area around Libya in an operation named \\"Attain Document\\",Operation Attain Document the first two parts of the operation being held from 26‚Äì30 January, and 12‚Äì15 February, without incident. The third part of the operation began on 23 March, with a surface action group from the United States Sixth Fleet consisting of three aircraft carriers ‚Äì , and ; five cruisers, six frigates, 12 destroyers, 250 aircraft and 27,000 personnel conducting three carrier operations near the gulf. ,USS Detroit (AOE-4)#1981‚Äì1989 and were the fuel, ammunition and combat stores (food and supplies) replenishment ships that supplied the entire battle group. Coral Sea and Saratoga had participated in the first two parts of the operation, and were joined by America in mid-March. The aircraft carriers dispersed in an east‚Äìwest line along the northern edge of Tripoli's Flight Information Region (FIR) approximately north of the Line of Death. America conducted flight operations from midnight to noon, Saratoga from noon to midnight, and Coral Sea from 05:30 to 18:30. Reduced coverage during darkness reflected the minimal Libyan night-time flight operations observed during the first two parts of the operation. Previously Muammar Gaddafi had made threats that he would shoot down or destroy U.S. aircraft or ships moving over the \\"Line of Death\\". According to U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, the United States' position was quite clear; there would be no restriction on U.S. naval movements through international waters. By crossing the \\"Line of Death\\", American forces were asserting their right to keep international sea lanes open and \\"conduct naval and air exercises in every part of the globe.\\" During the operations held in January, and February, the United States Navy had made 130 intercepts of Libyan fighters in the airspace over the Gulf of Sidra, although neither side opened fire. Hostilities On 23 March 1986, American aircraft from the three aircraft carriers crossed the \\"Line of Death\\" and began operating in the Gulf of Sidra. On 24 March at 06:00 (CET), , accompanied by two destroyers, and , moved south of the \\"Line\\", covered by fighter aircraft. A Libyan missile installation near Surt (Sirte) launched two Soviet-made SA-5 \\"Gammon\\" surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) at 07:52 (CET), toward F-14A Tomcats of Americas VF-102. The missiles missed their target and fell harmlessly into the sea. Two additional SA-5 missiles were launched at 13:52 toward McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets from Coral Sea acting as the southernmost combat air patrol (CAP); but the missiles were jammed by an EA-6B Prowler. Two hours later, two MiG-23s took off from Benina air base with orders to intercept and shoot down some of the U.S. fighters. Before the Libyan aircraft could get close enough, a U.S. E-2C Hawkeye detected them and alerted two F-14s from VF-33, which intercepted the MiGs at . The Libyans began aggressive head-on maneuvering in an effort to get into firing position on the two F-14s ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†a clear sign of hostile intent. An A-7 aboard USS America during flight operations against Libya in 1986 The F-14 wing leader reported \\"excessive hostile actions and intentions\\", which led the air warfare commander aboard to give the pilots the signal \\"warning yellow, weapons hold\\"; this meant the F-14s could open fire if necessary. An intense dogfight ensued, though without any missiles being fired. The F-14s dropped to , where they had a distinct advantage over the MiG-23s and positioned themselves between the sun and the Libyans. The F-14s moved into a six o'clock position behind the hostile MiGs, locked on to them with radar and acquired AIM-9 Sidewinder tones, which meant they were ready to shoot the Libyans down. The MiGs moved off, seeming to follow a return course to their base. However, one of them reversed course, turning against the F-14s; the F-14 wing leader acquired the MiG, and requested permission to open fire. Before permission could be granted, the MiG-23 turned away and headed south. An F-14 from VF-74 lands on USS Saratoga Several Libyan patrol boats headed out towards the U.S. battle group, and the Americans responded by sending up aircraft to counter them. When one of the patrol boats locked on to American aircraft with its fire control radar, , a destroyer leader who had been serving as anti-aircraft radar picket ship defending the carrier group's right flank responded by firing an RGM-84 Harpoon missile, striking the vessel and setting it ablaze; it was subsequently towed back to Benghazi. This was the first surface to surface firing of a Harpoon missile in combat. USS Saratoga launched A-7 Corsair II aircraft armed with HARM missiles from Attack Squadron VA-83, A-6 Intruder aircraft armed with Harpoon missiles and cluster bombs from VA-85 and EA-6Bs from VAQ-132. USS America had A-6Es from VA-34 and EA-6Bs from the Marine squadron VMAQ-2 and USS Coral Sea had A-6Es from VA-55 and EA-6Bs from VAQ-135 in the air; these were supported by several E-2Cs, F-14s, F/A-18s and KA-6Ds. The first air strikes occurred around 19:26 (CET) when two A-6 Intruders from VA-34 found a French-built patrol boat; the ship was first disabled by a Harpoon missile fired by one of the A-6 Intruders from VA-34 and then destroyed by Intruders from VA-85 using Rockeye cluster bombs. Forty minutes later, F-14s, F/A-18s, A-7Es and EA-6Bs headed towards the SA-5 site near Surt at low level and suddenly climbed, which caused the Libyans to activate their radars and launch missiles at the incoming aircraft; this prompted the A-7Es to launch several HARM missiles. The strike formation then descended to above sea level and turned back. It is unknown if any of the U.S. missiles struck their intended targets, but A-6Es from VA-86 and VA-55 turned to engage several Libyan missile boats. At around 21:55 (CET), two A-6Es from VA-55 attacked the Ain Zaquit which was heading towards , prompting Yorktown to vector the Intruders to deploy Harpoon missiles, one of which hit Ain Zaquit causing heavy damage. At the same time, Yorktown fired two Harpoon missiles at another La Combattante IIa-class boat, disabling it. Libyan corvette burns after attempting to engage US forces At approximately midnight (CET), the Libyans launched several SA-2s and SA-5s, this time at the American A-6Es and A-7Es, which responded by heading towards the coast. A-7Es from VA-83 launched HARM missiles, disabling several Libyan radars. Three more SA-5s were launched from Syrte with a single SA-2 launched near Benghazi. At 07:30 (CET) another Libyan Nanuchka-class corvette was intercepted by A-6Es from VA-55 and was disabled by Rockeye munitions; the corvette was later sunk by a Harpoon missile launched from a VA-85 A-6E. The operation was terminated after this strike with no losses to the Americans; 35 sailors were killed and there were an unknown number of material losses to the Libyans.

Her career has seen a rebirth after 2000 and has continued to the present day. Apart from acting, O'Connell started and owned the Canoco Publishing Company during the 1990s. Canoco is a Los Angeles-based company produced Astro Caster Magazine, which specialized in casting information and advice for actors and actresses. O'Connell has written numerous articles for the magazine as well as being its owner and publisher. Life and career O'Connell was born in Providence, Rhode Island. O'Connell's early career consisted primarily of TV show appearances (Three's Company, Happy Days, Dallas, Laverne & Shirley, Blansky's Beauties). In 1980 she starred in the slasher cult film New Year's Evil.Blu-ray/DVD roundup: Argento & Fulci collections, \\"VAMPIRE'S KISS,\\" \\"GRANNY\\" and more! =Role in Galaxy of Terror= She achieved lasting fame within the B-movie, horror film universe for her role as Dameia in Galaxy of Terror. Released in 1981, it was the second consecutive horror film she had appeared in, having also appeared in the 1980 film New Year's Evil. O'Connell's place as a scream queen legend was guaranteed with Galaxy of Terror due to the unique, bizarre, and exploitative scene in which her character is killed.Femme Fatales Magazine Volume 6, Number 4, October 1997 Trapped on an alien world, her character and fellow shipmates find themselves in a giant pyramid built by an ancient culture who used it as a mental playground/testing area for their children. The human crew unwittingly confront the pyramid, which creates monsters from the fears in their own minds, but the monsters come with more adult, psychological fears attached to them as well. The confrontations generally prove deadly to the crew since most of them are not aware of this and cannot overcome the sense of terror and humiliation generated by their attackers. O'Connell's character, Dameia, reveals at one point she has a significant fear of worms. Shortly thereafter, she is attacked by a giant 12-foot maggot. The psychological fear that Dameia confronts along with the worm is sexual in nature, because the monster graphically rapes her as it kills her. The scene as it was released contained enough nudity from the buxom O'Connell (and a body-double used for various shots) and was sexually explicit enough to achieve cult status for the movie and the actress. According to R. J. Kizer on the 2010 Shout! Factory re- release of Galaxy, it was initially even more explicit; in fact, it earned an X-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) upon the screening of its first cut. Kizer had to make a series of small edits to eliminate two things the MPAA gave the scene an X-rating for: some of Dameia's facial expressions as she's raped were too \\"ecstatic\\" and deemed suggestive or inappropriate, and some of the motions made by the giant worm and the nude actress entangled in tentacles underneath it simulated sexual intercourse too realistically. These tiny cuts allowed the film to maintain its desired R-rating, but even so, the sequence was restricted or the movie was banned from cinematic release in several countries for the lewd sexual content of this scene. Over time, the cut sequences were lost and are not on any currently released version of the film.Tales From the Lumberyard, companion disc to Galaxy of Terror blu-ray release, July 2010 As a result of this, O'Connell has had cameo appearances in several other horror films in the 1990s and early 2000s, and B-movie print productions like Femme Fatales and Fangoria have done features on her, the scene, and the film. O'Connell herself has a prominent role in the commentary of the DVD/Blu-ray release, as well as in its companion feature \\"Tales from the Lumber Yard\\" which discusses the making of the film. =Recent years= During the 1990s, O'Connell's focus shifted away from acting and into publishing. Her Canoco Publishing Company has continued operations for 20 years, and produces Astro Caster Magazine, a trade magazine which combines traditional casting for actors and actresses with astrological insights and information. More recently, O'Connell has begun taking acting parts in films again. She has appeared in three films, Spork, Going Down in LA-LA Land and the box-office hit The Change-Up. Her roles in these films have been more comedic than dramatic, similar to her roles on Three's Company and the mid-1980s film Hot Chili. Filmography *Blansky's Beauties (1977, TV Series) - Hillary S.

It is located in the southern sea turtle breeding zones. Ussangoda is a patch of high ground by the sea and spreads over a significant area. Unlike the rest of the land surrounding, it is only covered with grass and a few pockets of pigmy forests. The summit of Ussangoda area pans like a plateau for a significant length.  Geological and archaeological importance  Ussangoda is known for its unusual placement by soil structure, flora, and location. There are many folk stories related to this site which include different takes about the land. General belief is that it is a part of a meteor or a proximity to a meteor hit. The main rationale for this belief is the soils brick-like hard quality with a reddish colour which is unique to this patch of land. Some rocks and soil layers contain what some speculate to be remnants of an extreme heat (that can be caused by an event such as a meteor hit). It is also suspected that the soil has a high concentration of minerals/metals giving its unique colour. In several places, especially by the sea facing areas rocks and soil can be observed clearly having multiple layers usually with distinct colourization. It is however unclear whether these speculations have been tested in any proper scientific study at all. It can be also noticed that Ussangoda is located geographically closer to another archaeological site \\"Miniha Gal Kanda\\", where evidence for pre-historic human existence has been found. The rock debris has high iron concentration. Magnets attract them.  Legend  There are several legends related to the area. The site is considered a sacred/forbidden ground for general affairs in local lore. One popular belief is that Ussangoda is a ground of the local demi-god \\"Mangara\\". Other beliefs range from religiously rooted backgrounds to the unwritten/alternate history related to Ravana.

He died at age 35 with his girlfriend, Francoise Bardinet, when the apartment building in which he was living collapsed in the Mexico City earthquake of September 19, 1985. His early death made him a legend in Mexican rock. Biography Rodrigo was born in Tampico, Tamaulipas. He studied psychology for a brief time at the Universidad Veracruzana in Xalapa before moving to Mexico City in 1977 with the desire to make music. He arrived to the capital and began playing in bars and caf√©s. At first, he survived by singing covers in the streets of the city \\"in the English style.\\" Over time, he began to create an oeuvre from his experiences on the streets. The lyrics of Rockdrigo mixed the urban lifestyle with the troubles of the urban poor, and found many listeners among students. His songs could also be tender, such as \\"Metro Balderas,\\" the ballad about a man who has lost his lover, and hijacks a subway train. Glasses and broken guitar that belonged to Rockdrigo, found in the debris of the building which he lived in Mexico City. In the early 1980s he and other musicians including Rafael Catana, Jaime Lopez, and Roberto Ponce founded the La Liga de Musicos Errantes y Cantantes Rupestres (The League of Wandering Musicians and Prehistoric Cavemen Singers) which became known as the Movimiento Rupestre, a folk music scene that strongly influenced Mexican rock for the next ten years or so. Their music was similar to the Nueva canci√≥n movement in protesting social conditions, but unlike Nueva canci√≥n, they used street slang in their lyrics, were not overtly political, and drew on U.S. folk music instead of traditional Mexican instruments and sounds. Rockdrigo wrote the manifesto for the group. In 1983 the novelist Jos√© Agust√≠n said that Rockdrigo had \\"achieved what is, for me, an extraordinary accomplishment: making Spanish sound perfect, truly natural in rock'n'roll....From the beginning I thought that Rodrigo Gonz√°lez was our version of Bob Dylan with a sense of humor.\\" At the time of his death he was living in an apartment in the Unidad Tlatelolco, which was devastated by the 1985 earthquake. After his death musicians would gather at the Metro Balderas station on September 19 to commemorate him and the earthquake and sing his songs. He was survived by a daughter, Amandititita, who became a cumbia singer and songwriter. In 2011 she and others unveiled a statue of Rockdrigo at the Metro Balderas station.

Operation Balavegaya was launched in response to the siege of Elephant Pass by the LTTE. It is believed that Operation Balavegaya was the largest and most successful military operation of the Sri Lankan military until Operation Riviresa in 1995. Background In July 1990, when Maj. Gen. Denzil Kobbekaduwa took charge as commanding officer of Northern Operations, he instituted an operation code-named \\"Operation Gajasinghe\\" to pull out troops from Kilinochchi and strengthen the camp at Elephant Pass. He also established a temporary camp at Paranthan, north of Paranthan junction, for obtaining fresh water for the camp at Elephant Pass. Subsequently, Elephant Pass camp was expanded and transformed into a massive military complex, with a main base and four mini-camps, within a stretch of land three miles in diameter. At one time the Elephant Pass base and the satellite camps covered an area about 23 kilometers long and nearly 10 kilometers wide.

Sanath Karunaratne defended the camp. At that time the battle for Elephant Pass was the largest offensive operation of the LTTE. It began its first assault on the camp from the south of Elephant Pass. On the very first day LTTE attacked the camp at dawn and was supported by armor-plated bulldozers. Heavy mortars, machine guns and whatever available firepower the LTTE had was thrown into battle. Hundreds of fighters attempted to storm the defenses of the camp in wave after wave of attacks. Only a small portion of the southern defences fell into LTTE hands. At this juncture Lance Cpl. Gamini Kularatne of the 6th Battalion of the Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment managed to climb on top of an advancing bulldozer and lobbed a grenade into it with total disregard of his own life. He was killed during this action but the bulldozer which would have caused much destruction was immobilized. Cpl. Kularatne was posthumously the first recipient of the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya, the highest gallantry medal in the Sri Lankan Armed Forces. On the second day Maj. Lalith Buddhadasa, the second in command of the base, was killed along with several other soldiers by a mortar attack. Attempts by the Sri Lankan Air Force to land helicopters inside the base proved futile, due to the heavy AA gunfire of the Tigers. The LTTE by then had surrounded the base and was closing in from all directions. The main thrust was from the south and there were attempts to penetrate the defenses with earth-moving vehicles and artillery fire on the outer defense positions. However, the Sri Lankan Army, which fought valiantly, foiled the LTTE's attempts. Eventually the Rest House camp in the southern sector of the base fell into the hands of the LTTE. Sustaining heavy losses, Sri Lankan troops fell back to the rear positions. \\"Prabhakaran openly declared that he had waged the 'Mother of all Battles'. He was very confident of victory. Troops were running short of ammunition, food and medicine. Many airdrops were carried out and about 60% of the airdrops fell within the camp premises. Fierce fighting continued for four days and the LTTE forces, both male and female cadres, continued their relentless onslaught on the southern and northern sectors of Elephant Pass despite mounting casualties. The entrapped Sri Lankan soldiers were completely surrounded and fought for their lives. Operation Balavegaya I To break the siege and reinforce the Elephant Pass camp, Maj. Gen. Kobbekaduwa, the GOC of the 2nd Division, along with Brig. Vijaya Wimalaratne as Amphibious Task Force Commander launched \\"Operation Balavegaya\\", an amphibious operation since there was no cleared land route available to ensure speedy reinforcement.Major General Vijaya Wimalaratne, Chaminda Perera, Daily News, Retrieved 04 April 2015 The army drew up this massive operation to include a force of 10,000 soldiers, which consisted of several battle-hardened and experienced regiments that included battalions from the Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI), Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment(SLSR), Gemunu Watch (GW), the Gajaba Regiment (GR) supported by the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps (SLAC) and the Sri Lanka Artillery. The troops of the 2nd Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. Kobbekaduwa, were moved to Pullimodai from the Trincomalee Naval base and made up the amphibious Task Force, commanded by Brig. Vijaya Wimalaratne, consisting of 1st Brigade (Col. Anton Wijendra) and 3rd Brigade (Col. Sarath Fonseka). A flotilla of ships made up of landing craft, gunboats and fast attack crafts of the Sri Lanka Navy under the command of Rear Adm. Quitus Wickramaratne transported the troops. Maj. Gen. Kobbekaduwa was present on board the flagship SLNS Wickrama with troops from the 3rd Battalion, SLLI (Lt. Col. Gamini Jayasundera) and 3rd Battalion, GR (Lt. Col. Seevali Wanigasekera) and Brig. Vijaya Wimalaratne was on the SLNS Edithara with Capt. H.R. Amaraweera, who commanded the flotilla, and Group Capt. Dick Sally, who co-ordinated the air operations. The first attempt at a seaborne landing at Vettilakerni, located 12 kilometers east of Elephant Pass, scheduled for 14:30 hours on July 15, 1991 met with stiff resistance, causing Brig. Wimalaratne to delaly the landing. With his personal effort, the second attempt was made at 18:00 hours under cover of fire from Navy gunboats and close air support from air force Sia Marchetti SF-260 bombers directed by Wing Cmdr. Sunil Cabral. The first wave landed, led by Capt. Dushan Rajaguru, Coy Comd 1 SLSR, and Capt. Ralf Nugera, Coy Comd 3 SLLI, meeting heavy resistance, yet the 1st Battalion 1 SLSR and 3rd Battalion SLLI secured a beachhead that night. Within 24 hours the remaining units of the 1st Brigade and the 3rd Brigade landed. Thereafter arrived a holding brigade under the command of Col. Devinda Kalupahana. Once the beachhead was securely established, Gen. Kobbekaduwa authorized Brig. Wimalaratne to begin the operation to link up with the garrison in Elephant Pass, which was about 10 km away. \\"Many terrorists were killed and large stocks of arms and ammunition captured from the terrorists. There was an intense fighting near the Mulliyan Kovil, northwest of Vettilaikerni. The reason was that the terrorists were determined to recover a stock of gold hidden near the Kovil [Temple]. In fact, the terrorists managed to evict the troops from Kovil area for a short while by counterattacking. They managed to take the gold away.\\" - A Soldier's Version by Maj. Gen. Sarath Munasinghe - pages 115-116. The terrain consisted of sand dunes, dotted with thorny scrub and Palmyra palms, an area that did not provide any natural cover against aerial, naval and artillery bombardment. Therefore, the confrontation assumed the character of a conventional warfare, with the combatants facing each other in open battle. It took nearly 18 days for Sri Lankan troops to fight their way on the 12-kilometer stretch to reach the Elephant Pass base, due to heavy resistance and minefields. On the third week of fighting a squadron of Alvis Saladin armored cars of the 1st Reconnaissance Regiment, SLAC commanded by Maj. Shiran Jinasena broke through enemy lines despite two of its vehicles being destroyed by mines. The breakthrough was followed up by Saladin and Saracen APCs of the 1st Reconnaissance Regiment and 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment of the Armored Corps and Buffel APCs. The armored thrust on 2 August was led by Maj. Jinasena and was followed by Maj. Rohan De Silva of 4/GR, who commanded a squadron of Buffel APCs. At this point the three infantry brigades under Brig. Wimalarathna, which included the newly arrived 7th Brigade under Col. Gamini Angammana, went into action. On the 4th of August forward elements of the Task Force reached the beleaguered garrison, singing the battle song Hela Jathika Abhimane.War Or Peace in Sri Lanka, By Saroj Pathak, T D S A Dissanayaka According to Adele Ann Balasingham, an LTTE operative, \\"It took exactly 18 days for the several battalions of Sri Lankan army troops, who landed along the Vadamaradchy eastern coast in a massive rescue operation, to reach the besieged Elephant Pass base\\". To advance the 12-kilometer distance, the Sinhala regiments, backed by heavy armor and air cover, had to engage in fierce clashes with the LTTE and fight for every inch of land. The fighting continued in that area until August 9, when the battered LTTE forces made a tactical withdrawal. Aftermath The LTTE suffered heavy casualties--573 Tamil Tigers including 123 women fighters were killed (according to Adele Ann Balasingham) in the battle. According to official government figures, 202 army personnel were killed in the battle to retain Elephant Pass base. There were no official figures of the injuries sustained by the armed forces. Maj. Gen. Sarath Munasinghe, at that time the Sri Lankan army spokesman--and who wrote \\"A Soldier's Version\\" after his retirement--writes, \\"On 4 August 1991, I was lucky to personally witness the link-up with the EPS camp. It was the biggest victory ever over the LTTE at that time. There was joy and smiles all over. Prabhakaran's much publicized 'Mother of all Battles' was defeated. 202 valiant men including some prominent officers had laid their lives. Over one thousand terrorists were killed at EPS and during the operation to link up. Many citizens voluntarily sent in sweets, chutney, cigarettes and many other food items to the soldiers in the battlefield. There were banners and posters praising the soldiers in many parts of the country.\\".

Two varieties are known, Salvia azurea var. azurea (azure sage) and Salvia azurea var. grandiflora (Pitcher sage). The stems of wild S. azurea tend to be long and unbranched, causing them to flop under the weight of their flowers. When grown in cultivation, the stems of S. azurea are sometimes cut back early in the growing season to encourage branching and slow the vertical growth of the plant to prevent lodging. Habitat S. azurea is found from Utah east to Connecticut and from Minnesota south to Florida. S. azurea var. azurea tends to be found in the eastern and southeastern portion of this range, while S. azurea var. grandiflora is found in the west and northwest. In some states within its native range, it has become especially rare, such as in Illinois, where it is listed as a threatened species. Throughout its range, it is found growing wild on roadsides, glades, prairies, savannas, fields and pastures. S. azurea prefers dry, sunny conditions in a variety of soils, including clay, gravel, and loam. In wetter conditions, the plant will still grow and bloom, but tends to lodge.

Biography  Mahoe was probably from the House of Suren, one of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian state. During the Islamic invasion of Iran, Yazdegerd III went to refuge in Marv; when he arrived to the city along with his army chief Farrukhzad, Mahoe warmly received them. However, Farrukhzad did not stay for long and mutinied against Yazdegerd and left the city. Mahoe used this opportunity to secretly plot with the Hephthalite ruler Nizak against Yazdegerd, who, however, discovered the plot and fled from Mahoe's residence. He was eventually assassinated in a mill by an assassin sent by Mahoe. Meanwhile, the Muslims were seizing eastern parts of the fallen Iran, and Mahoe was in the end forced to make peace with the Muslims and pay tribute. During the reign of the caliph Ali (656‚Äì661), a complaint about Mahoe's dehqans not paying tribute was sent to the latter, who then went to Kufa in Iraq. However, during Mahoe's arrival to the city, the inhabitants of Khorasan, who disliked the governorship of Mahoe, revolted. After this, Mahoe is no longer mentioned in any source.

The sea surrounding these Islands is covered with fast ice most of the year and is obstructed by pack ice even in the summer, so that these islands are merged with the mainland and animals can go across the ice.GoogleEarth - Location This island group belongs to the Krasnoyarsk Krai administrative division of Russia. None of these islands have had much historical importance, except for the fact that they are located very close to the Northern Sea Route.William Barr, The First Soviet Convoy to the Mouth of the Lena. Geography The Saint Peter Islands are surrounded by narrow beach ridges and swales. They are located in the Laptev Sea coastal region, off the eastern shores of the Taymyr Peninsula, between Bukhta Marii Pronchishchevoy and Bukhta Faddeya.Geographical names *The largest island is Ostrov Petr-Severnyy with a surface of 175 km¬≤. It is located very close to the coast, separated from it by a sound that is only 1.2 km wide in its narrowest point. The latitude of this island is 76¬∞ 40' N and its longitude 112¬∞ 25' E. *Ostrov Petr-Yuzhnyy is significantly smaller than its northern neighbor. It is located 9 km to the SW of Ostrov Petr-Severnyy and it is farther offshore.

Life and career Sampson was born in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England. Upon completing his education, he worked as an errand boy in the advertising industry. In his spare time he recorded songs and dropped one of his demo's with Cliff Richard who got him a recording contract. He had a UK hit single in May 1960 with his backing band, The Hunters (instrumental band), with \\"Sweet Dreams\\", which peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" was released on the Columbia Records label, and spent six weeks on the chart. His first ever recording was a four-tune EP demo with Steve Laine, later of the Liverpool Five. Both were singers on the EP with a backing band that was never named but included Don Groom on drums, John Milner on bass and Tony Haslett on guitar. His lack of subsequent chart presence left him listed as a one-hit wonder while he moved to Hamburg. There he played at the Star Club, until he returned to England and opened a record shop in Walthamstow. A collection of his early material was released in the 1990s and he appeared at occasional nostalgia shows. Sampson died at Colchester Hospital, Colchester, Essex, in March 2014, aged 73.

The market is located at the intersection of Avenida Almirante Lacerda and Avenida Horta e Costa on the Macau Peninsula and is one of the most popular markets in Macau. The building is symmetrical in layout and has a clock tower in the middle and a watchtower in each corner. It was gazetted by the Government of Macau as an architectural heritage site (Decree No.83/92/M). In olden times, the market was situated next to the waterfront from where the sellers bought its goods directly from the docks. The surrounding street, Red Market Pedestrian Street, is known for its flowers-selling kiosks. A rich variety of seafood produce is available twice daily from mainland China or locally. In addition, meat (third floor), fish (second floor), poultry, vegetables (ground floor), dried food, fresh fruits, flowers and other perishable products (outside at the Red Market Pedestrian Street) are available too. The Red Market opens daily from 07:30 - 19:30hrs. Nearby, heading towards the Flora Garden at Guia Hill and Avenida de Horta e Costa is another main shopping area known as the Three Lamps District.

CANT) was an Italian aviation company which originally specialised in building naval aircraft, formed in 1923 as part of the CNT (Cantiere Navale Triestino, or in English Trieste Naval Shipyard). The company produced a number of designs for the Italian military, but ceased operations in 1944. History In 1921, the Cosulich family of Trieste, owners of CNT decided to enter the aviation business. Already active in shipping and shipbuilding, they followed the same pattern by establishing first an air taxi service (SISA, 1921) and then a seaplane workshop at Monfalcone (within the existing shipyard) in 1923. The first successful design was the CANT 6 a three-engine biplane flying-boat bomber built in 1925. SISA trained pilots for the Regia Aeronautica (the Italian Air Force) using CANT 7 and CANT 18 biplanes; from 1926 it added airline services, using the CANT 10 and CANT 22 cabin seaplanes. The main designer was Raffaele Conflenti. The workshops survived on license production and prototypes. In 1930, CNT merged with other shipyards to form the C.R.D.A. (Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico - United Adriatic Shipbuilding), but aircraft continued to use the CANT designation. In 1933, C.R.D.A. was acquired by state conglomerate IRI, and Italo Balbo persuaded Filippo Zappata, then working with Bl√©riot, to become chief designer. In the following nine years, CANT flew 18 new types that garnered 40 world records; it also added a landplane factory, test department, and airfield as the workforce grew from 350 to 5,000. The CANT Z.501 (1934) and Z.506 (1935) seaplanes, and the Z.1007 landplane bomber (1937) became the standard Italian types in their categories. Zappata saw wooden airplanes as a temporary necessity, and his new designs were conceived with all-metal construction, including the Z.1018 bomber twin, Z.511 four- engine floatplane airliner, and Z.515 twin floatplane. Around 1939 Zappata became disillusioned with CANT and started negotiating with Breda, which he joined in 1942; in addition, military requirements fluctuated. The Z.1018 started in wood as \\"flying mockup\\", developed as a very different wooden preseries, and metamorphosed into metal for production with bomber, torpedo- bomber, and night-fighter variants. Not surprising, none of these types became operational before the Italian armistice in 1943. The ensuing German occupation and USAAF raids in March‚ÄìApril 1944 stopped all production, and only the shipyard was rebuilt after the war.

It comprises a collection of islands located in the south-western waters of Singapore, namely Jurong, Bukum and Sudong Islands.URA Planning Report - WATER CATCHMENT, LIM CHU KANG, TENGAH, NE & W ISD The Western Islands originally comprised 27 islands, once home to the native Malay islanders in the past. In the 1990s, the government decided to reclaim land to form one major island, called Jurong Island. It was subsequently formed from the amalgamation of several offshore islands, chiefly the seven main islands of Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Merlimau, Pulau Pesek, Pulau Pesek Kechil, Pulau Sakra and Pulau Soraya. The planning area is located on the Singapore Straits, with Tuas situated to its west, as well as Pioneer, Boon Lay, Jurong East and Queenstown to its north. Western Islands planning area also shares a maritime boundary with the Southern Islands to its east.  Location  Although called 'Western Islands', the islands are not actually located on the west of the main island of Singapore. They are in fact located south-west of the main island. The islands are also relatively near to the Southern Islands.  Jurong Island  Jurong Island is the biggest and most important island among the Western Islands. It serves at the petroleum and petrochemical hub of the city-state, and it houses the third largest refining centre in the world. Jurong Island is home to over 94 petroleum, petrochemical, specialty chemical and supporting companies with more than S$26 billion in fixed assets investment on Jurong Island. Industry luminaries such as ExxonMobil and Shell have already established a strong presence on Jurong Island. Jurong Island is linked to the main island by a 2.3 km causeway known as the Jurong Island Highway, opened in March 1999. Access to the island is restricted to persons who have a Jurong Island Security Pass. Other restrictions include that one must declare any photographic equipment that they are bringing to the island.

It has United Nations Economic and Social Council Consultative status and promotes the concept of youth-led development. History Peace Child International began during the Cold War as a musical, based on Bernard Benson's The Peace Book, aimed at resolving conflict between the United States and USSR, and at bringing youth from both countries into contact. The first performance was in October 1981 at the Royal Albert Hall, with Susannah York as the narrator. The musical was then taken to the United States, where it was premiered at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. in December 1982. The core of the musical was composed by David Gordon and written by David Woollcombe, but it was re-written and customised by the cast wherever it was performed. Since its debut the musical has been used in conflict resolution efforts in Azerbaijan and Armenia, Central America, Cyprus, the former Yugoslavia, India, Israel and Northern Ireland. After the Earth Summit in June 1992, Peace Child produced a children's version of Agenda 21, Rescue Mission: Planet Earth. The book was designed, edited and aimed at young people and went on to be translated into 23 languages. Since this point, Peace Child has focused mainly on sustainable development issues, and produced a number of further publications on the subject with UN agencies. Peace Child has also shifted its focus to an emphasis on youth unemployment, developing a number of training programmes in Europe, Africa and India to increase employability skills in young people. Current projects =Be the Change Academy= The Be the Change Academy programme aims to educate young people in West Africa in entrepreneurial skills, from financial literacy to business plan writing, and offers finance. There are Be the Change Academies (BTCA) in Paynesville, Liberia, Conakry, Guinea, Kenema, Sierra Leone and Visakhapatnam, India. Local young people who have a business idea can enrol in a BTCA and receive training from business experts. New projects are underway with funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. =Work the Change= The Work the Change programme is a peer-to-peer education course that aims to address the skills mismatch cause of youth unemployment. Through CV writing and job interview workshops as well as events, Work the Change improves employability for teenagers in the UK and prepares them for the world of work. World Youth Congress Series Since 1999, Peace Child has organised the World Youth Congress (WYC), which aims to promote the role that young people can play in the field of sustainable development and the achievement of the UN's Millennium Development Goals. =Hawaii, 1999= The first WYC, held in Hawaii in 1999, focused on establishing priorities for the new millennium for young people from all regions of the world, with the top worldwide priority being appropriate education. =Morocco, 2003= The second WYC was held in Casablanca, Morocco, with the themes of tolerance, solidarity, and the role of young people in sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Delegates to the conference also spent time participating in action projects organised by Moroccan NGOs in all provinces of the country. =Scotland, 2005= The Scottish WYC, held in Stirling in August 2005, explored young people's motivations to volunteer and had an overall theme of 'young people working for a sustainable world community'. As in the previous Congress, delegates spent three days working on a range of action projects throughout Scotland. =Queb√©c, 2008= The fourth WYC was held in Quebec City in August 2008 under the name Regeneration 2008.

The film stars Padmapriya, Geethu Mohandas, Manju Pillai, and Nandita Das in the major roles, and KPAC Lalitha, Mukesh, Manoj K. Jayan, Sona Nair, Sreejith Ravi, Ravi Vallathol, Nandulal, Remya Nabeeshan, P. Sreekumar, M. R. Gopakumar, and Kavya Madhavan in supporting roles. The movie chronicles a journey of womanhood across assorted backdrops with a classic amalgamation of source matters and techniques that splendidly spans times and frames. The movie has four distinct parts - each adapted from separate short stories by Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai. Each of the parts narrate the stories of women from different strata of the society. Though the stories are not explicitly connected in narration, a pattern emerges in the flow of the movie - both in the chronological setting and the stature of the women. Adoor Gopalakrishnan won for Best Director and B. Ajithkumar for Best Editor at 55th National Film Awards. Plot Naalu Pennungal is the story of four women from Kuttanad in Alappuzha district in Kerala. The stories are set in the years between the 1940s to the 1960s. The Prostitute The first story profiled is the story of a street prostitute Kunjipennu (Padmapriya) and Pappukutty (Sreejith Ravi) who decide to start a life as husband and wife. They have bound themselves in matrimony that does not have any legal sanction. When the law catches up with them, they do not have anything that can be an evidence of their commitment towards each other. The story ends in the court scene where the helpless couple are punished for the crime of prostituition. The Virgin Kumari (Geethu Mohandas)- literally, a virgin girl- is a farm worker who shouldered the responsibility of running her household at a very early age. Her father (M. R. Gopakumar), having realized her advancing age, accepts a suitable marriage proposal for her. After the wedding, her husband, Narayanan (Nandhu), behaves strangely, as he evades any kind of contact with her including verbal conversation and sexual activity. The husband's mysterious behaviour is accentuated by his glut. After a few days, the couple make the customary visit to Kumari's house. Narayanan, leaves Kumari in her house after the visit and never returns to take her back. As days pass, rumours spread that she has been abandoned by him because of her infidelity. Her father unable to bear the shame of it, picks up a fight with the neighbour who had brought the marriage proposal. Kumari, who had maintained silence so far, emerges from the house and declares that the marriage never happened. The Housewife Chinnu Amma (Manju Pillai) is a childless housewife. She lives a fairly contented life with her loving husband (Murali). Her husband works in a nearby town and she spends her time alone at home. One day, she is visited by Nara Pillai (Mukesh), a former classmate. Nara Pillai had run away to Tamil Nadu, long ago and now visits his village rarely. He is said to have made good in Tamil Nadu and speaks Malayalam with a heavy Tamil accent even when he is back in Kerala. Through their conversations we realize that they both had an amorous encounter in their childhood, from which Chinnu Amma escaped narrowly due to her fear of getting pregnant out of wed-lock. Nara Pillai assumes that she is vulnerable and attempts to talk her into bed, promising her a healthy off spring. Chinnu Amma's mind vacillates, but in the end of the movie she boldly declines the offer. The Spinster The last one, is about an upper- middle-class girl (Nandita Das). She has a quiet life in a family composed of her widowed mother (K. P. A. C. Lalitha), an elder brother and two sisters. The story begins with a marriage proposal for her, which fails as the groom (Ravi Vallathol) prefers her younger sister (Kavya Madhavan). She silently witnesses the marriage. As years pass on, her elder brother (Ashokan) also gets married. As she walks towards middle age, her youngest sister (Remya Nambeesan) also gets married. Once the mother passes away, she is forced to move in with her younger sister's family. Things seem to go well initially, with her getting close to her nieces. Her sister's husband apologizes to her, for being the reason for her failed marriage proposal. But, soon problems surface as her sister gets jealous of her and starts imagining a non-existing affair with her husband and her. She goes back home alone, refusing to live with either her brother or the youngest sister. She finally has broken the shackles of others controlling her life and has decided to live on her own. Production The project to make films on Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai's stories came when Doordarshan in their Timeless Classics series wanted to compile works of writers in different languages who have produced classic literature. This was the first film in the project and was followed by Oru Pennum Randaanum in the next year. Both the films have a four-chapter- structure based on independent short stories by Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai. Both the films also share the same geographical and temporal setting. Adoor selected the stories on which the movie is based, from the 300-400 stories that Pillai wrote. They were originally written over a long period of time. The director stated that, he chose these particular stories, because of their current relevance. He has claimed that unlike his previous films, this one is less complex. Reception The film premiered in the masters section of the Toronto International Film Festival in September,2007. The films has so far been screened at more than twenty festivals The Miami International Film Festival selected Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Naalu Pennungal. Besides Adoor, Geethu Mohandas who featured in the story 'Kanyaka' and Martin Sebastian, the co-producer of the film attended the film festival. The film was also screened at the following festivals. * 51st London film festival. * Vienna Film Festival. * Seattle International Film Festival. Legacy Noted Marathi filmmaker Sachin Kundalkar said that his third film Gandha (Smell), an ensemble of three stories interconnected by the theme of 'smell', was inspired by Naalu Pennungal.

Although not much of the community remains, the U.S. Geological Survey considers it a populated place. The community existed as a \\"flag\\" station along a railroad, and is named after railroad executive Joel N. Converse. Like many communities in Blackford County, this village declined after the end of the Indiana Gas Boom, which ended in the early 20th century.  History  In 1837, Edward Crumley moved to the southeast corner of the Blackford County, and began a farm with his family. The area in this corner of the county would eventually be named Jackson Township. Crumley's farm was located at a crossroads, and the area became known as Crumley's Crossing. The crossroads area grew into a small community with several cabins, a blacksmith shop, and a sawmill.A History of Blackford County...., p. 129. The Union and Logansport Railroad Company reached Blackford County in 1867, and the community became a flag stop on the railroad.Biographical and historical record of Jay and Blackford Counties..., p. 758. The community was platted in 1867, and renamed for railroad executive Joel N. Converse. In addition to a sawmill and blacksmith shop, the community had a store, school, and church. The church was a Methodist church, but later became the Kingsley Full Gospel church. For this reason, the area is sometimes called by a third name, which is \\"Kingsley\\". Thus, Crumley's Crossing, Converse, and Kingsley all refer to the same place in Blackford County. Blackford County's Converse should not be confused with the town of Converse, which is located in Grant County. =Railroad= The railroad line that ran through Converse was named Union and Logansport Railroad Company by the time it entered Blackford County, and it was the county‚Äôs first railroad.Biographical and historical record of Jay and Blackford Counties...., pp. 759-760, and pp. 239-240. This line was proposed in 1862, and completed to Hartford City in 1867 ‚Äî running through the Blackford County communities of Dunkirk, Converse, Millgrove, and Hartford City. Eventually, a stop named Renner was also added to the line west of Hartford City. Converse was a flag stop southeast of Millgrove.A History of Blackford County...., p. 19.The railroad map shown herein shows Converse in the southeast corner of the county, between Dunkirk and Millgrove. A map from David Rumsey collection, which is over 100 years old, also shows the community. The railroad was eventually named Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad.Biographical and historical record of Jay and Blackford Counties..., pp. 759-760. Other names for the railroad since that time include the Panhandle division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Penn Central Railroad Company, Conrail, and Norfolk Southern Railway. The line is now abandoned between Converse and Hartford City. Geography Converse is located at in East Central Indiana, between Dunkirk and Hartford City. The northern half of Indiana, including what became Jackson Township and Converse, was flattened by two glaciers millions of years ago.A History of Blackford County..., pp. 8-9. These glaciers are also responsible for the rich Blackford County farmland.A History of Blackford County..., p. 10. The region is agriculture-oriented. Soybeans and corn are the most popular crops grown in Blackford County, and over 65,000 acres are devoted to these two crops.Purdue University's Indiana CropMAP web site. Additional crops and livestock are also grown in the county. The Zip Code 47336 includes Dunkirk, Indiana, which is several miles to the east of Converse. =Climate= Converse/Crumley‚Äôs Crossing has a typical Midwestern humid continental seasonal climate. There are four distinct seasons, with winters being cold with moderate snowfall, while summers can be warm and humid. The highest average temperature is in July at 74 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C), while the lowest average temperature is in January at 26 ¬∞F (‚àí8.0 ¬∞C). However, summer high temperatures average 86 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C) in July, and winter low average temperatures are 18 ¬∞F (‚àí8 ¬∞C) in January and February.

P. Zhuravlev to Maria Pronchishcheva Bay and unloaded men, women and materials there. The plan was to establish a permanent base camp in the shores of this gulf in order to exploit the resources of this area of the Soviet Arctic. The men were experienced in trapping and the idea was that they should get their own food. In the spring of the following year, several of the 21 people of the base (ten men, four women and seven children) were afflicted with scurvy. They were healed by Dr. Urvantseva, who travelled by dogsled from the provisional wintering station that had been set by her husband scientist Nikolay Urvantsev at the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands the same year. The doctor stayed 11 days at the Bukhta Marii Pronchishchevoy camp until she could see clear signs of improvement as a result of the dietary changes prescribed by her. During the 1930s the whole area surrounding Maria Pronchishcheva Bay experienced a limited boom owing to the first icebreaker convoys plying the Northern Sea Route.

Millgrove‚Äôs glass factory was one of 15 glass factories that have existed in Blackford County, and most of these factories existed during the Indiana Gas Boom.The (Muncie) Star Press, December 1, 2002, p. 4A. (There were numerous glass and gas companies in the county at that time.) Eleven more glass factories have existed in nearby Dunkirk, Indiana. The Millgrove Glass Company was incorporated in 1898, and made glass containers. Originally, the company took advantage of the abundant supply of natural gas for a source of fuel. By 1905, the supply of natural gas in the region was diminishing, and the Millgrove Glass Company used gas made from coal in addition to natural gas.

Renner was a railroad stop on the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad. The land around the railroad stop was originally used to supply timber for railroad crossties, and eventually became a livestock farm. Housing for the families of the employees of the livestock farm was also located nearby. Although it is not known for certain, Renner is thought to have been named for railroad executive John W. Renner.The Blackford County Historical Society believes that the Renner railroad stop is probably named after railroad executive John W. Renner. Renner was an executive of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroad, and later the Pennsylvania Railroad, and retired with over 50 years of railroad experience.Pennsylvania Railroad, p. 3. Another community, Rennerdale, Pennsylvania, was named in his honor in 1895. The farm adjacent to the Renner railroad station was owned by Benjamin Johnson.

In 1919, Johnson sold all the farm's livestock, and then sold the farm. The farm was purchased by Fred A. Stimson. Stimson had purchased some of the Renner Stock Farm's cattle, and returned them to the Renner Stock Farm. He successfully continued the farm's tradition of award-winning livestock.American Cattle Breeding Association, p. 754. Early in 1927, Stimson sold the cattle, and general farming was practiced afterward. In 1937, the farm was sold to the Scripps Foundation in connection with Miami University (Oxford Ohio).

The rural community is located on Indiana State Road 18, about one mile west of its intersection with Indiana State Road 3. During the 1890s, Roll participated in the Indiana Gas Boom, as oil and gas wells were located nearby. Roll's E.C. Storms Natural Gas Company was one of Blackford County's many gas companies that existed during that time.Blatchley, p. 405.

As the largest community in Washington Township, Roll fared better than smaller communities in the area (such as Silas) because Roll had a better school and more merchants. As transportation improved even more, Roll merchants also lost business to larger communities. After the gas boom prosperity declined, agriculture again ascended to be the most important economic factor in Roll's corner of Blackford County. Unfortunately, prosperity in agriculture is not always reflected in nearby towns such as Roll, and many small towns in the \\"Corn Belt\\" continue to decline in size and affluence. History In the early 19th century, much of what would become the state of Indiana was still frequented by native Indian tribes. The Miami tribe was the most powerful group of Indians in the region, and they were known to visit what would become northern Blackford County. Other tribes that visited the area were the Potawatomi and Delaware.See Biographical and historical record of Jay and Blackford Counties, page 715. Non-native settlers began arriving in what would become Blackford County during the 1830s.See Goodrich and Tuttle‚Äôs ‚ÄúAn Illustrated History of the State of Indiana‚Äù, page 550. Indiana Blackford County was established in 1838 and 1839, as a section of swampland split from the west side of Jay County. =Dundee= Originally, the Roll community was named Dundee. A national Post Office directory for 1855 lists a Dundee in Blackford County.See Leech‚Äôs Post Office directory, page 50. Dundee The 1860 United States Census lists Dundee as the Post Office for Washington Township in Blackford County. The Dundee population at that time was 353 people living in 71 houses. Eight structures were listed as unoccupied. Almost every occupation cited is farmer. One of the farmers was Ohio-born Mathias Roll, age 55, living with his wife and five children (see picture of Census page in Wikimedia Commons).All of this information is from reviewing scans of pages from the 1860 United States Census. Ancestry and Census records indicate the Mathias Roll's second marriage was in Ohio in 1843, and from this marriage a child was born in Dundee in 1853.Some census information is easily available to subscribers to census databases, some can be found free on the web. Mathias Roll This indicates that the Roll family probably came to Dundee between 1843 and 1853. A story told by two Roll family members/descendants states that Mathias Roll used to ride his horse to Hartford City to pick up mail for folks living in Dundee. Eventually, the mail load became too much for one horse, so a Post Office was established in Dundee. Because a community named Dundee already existed elsewhere in the state, the Dundee Post Office in Washington Township was called the Roll Post Office.This story, which fits with other evidence, was told by two different Roll family members. The first of the stories also confirms that ‚ÄúRoll‚Äù rhymes with ‚Äúall‚Äù (or ‚Äúdoll‚Äù), not with ‚Äúmole‚Äù. Roll Story1 Roll Story2 Roll Story3 Mathias Roll was still living with his family (including Edmund Roll) in Washington Township in 1870 according to the U.S. Census. The Census lists Hartford City, instead of Dundee, as the Post Office for the Roll family in Washington Township. An 1875 Post Office directory does not list Dundee or Roll.See Goodrich and Tuttle‚Äôs ‚ÄúAn Illustrated History of the State of Indiana‚Äù, pages 699-705. Post However, an 1876 atlas map still shows the town as Dundee.The map can be found on the web site that displays the David Rumsey Collection. Rumsey Map The community name of Dundee eventually fell out of favor because another town in Indiana already had that name, plus the Post Office was called the Roll Post Office. Gradually, Blackford County's Dundee became known as Roll. By 1880, the region was still farming-oriented. The population of Washington Township, at 16 percent of the county total, was 1,273 out of the Blackford County total of 8,020. The county had 866 farms, and 46 manufacturing establishments that employed a total of only 171 people.See Jay and Blackford, page 761. Blackford County had a total of 25 registered physicians in 1882, and three were listed as living in Roll (not Dundee).See Stevens‚Äô First Annual Report of Secretary of the Indiana State Board of Health, page 218. Blackford Physicians A cemetery located in Roll, and now known as the Roll Cemetery, contains graves for at least twelve members of the Roll family (among other families). All Rolls buried there were born in the 19th century. A Matthias Roll (it has been spelled with one and two ‚Äút‚Äùs ‚Äì his father used two) was buried there in 1885. =Gas boom= Railroad map of Blackford County in 1890s with Roll in the northwest quadrantDuring the late 1880s, the discovery of natural gas in east- central Indiana led to a gas boom in the area. Numerous manufacturing companies moved to the Blackford County area, lured by promises of free or low-cost natural gas. Blackford County had 18 natural gas companies in 1895, including the E.C. Storms Natural Gas Company in Roll.This excludes gas wells owned by individuals for personal use. See page 405 of the Indiana Department of Geology and Natural Resources Annual Report for 1895. Gas Co In 1901, oil was struck on the Joseph Bird farm in Washington Township (near Roll).See ‚ÄúGreat Indiana Oil Strike‚Äù, The New York Times, February 12, 1901. Oil was found in Blackford County's Washington and Harrison Townships, and one oil field near Roll was considered the most productive in the state.Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, p. 54. Blackford County's population increased from 8,020 in 1880 to 17,213 in 1900. However, by 1905 the boom was mostly over, as much of the natural gas was wasted or mismanaged. The brief boom transformed much of east-central Indiana from an agriculture-oriented economy to an economy that also included manufacturing. From 1880 to 1900, Blackford, Delaware, and Grant counties all had their populations double.For 1880 populations, see Stevens page 118-119, and for 1900 see Moore page 117. Blackford increased from 8,020 to 17,213, Delaware from 22,926 to 49,624, and Grant from 23,618 to 54,693. Stevens Moore In 1901, Hartford City factories employed 1,077 people, and Montpelier factories employed 269.See pages 57 and 91 of the state of Indiana‚Äôs Annual Report of the Department of Inspection. Hartford City (A total of 171 people in the entire county worked in manufacturing in 1880.) Roll did not have access to a navigable waterway or a railroad (see 1890s map) ‚Äì while nearby Marion (to the west), Montpelier (east), and Hartford City (south) all benefited from vital transportation resources. The lack of transportation facilities meant that Roll could not compete with nearby communities to attract manufacturers, and it did not take advantage of the natural gas and oil to the extent that other communities did. =After the boom= Last gas boom building in Roll The boom ended in the first decade of the 20th century as the natural gas became depleted. Blackford County‚Äôs population peaked in the 1910 Census at 17,000, and the county has never again been the home of so many people. (The county‚Äôs population in the 2010 Census is 12,766.) In 1907, Roll‚Äôs schoolhouse was condemned by the state of Indiana. The two-room building had been built in 1893.See Tucker‚Äôs Twenty- sixth Annual Report of the State Board of Health of Indiana, page 96. Roll School However, by 1916, Roll had a new school facility for all grades through high school, and a gym was added in 1938. The local sports teams eventually became known as the ‚ÄúRed-Rollers‚Äù. The last graduating class from Roll High School was the Class of 1963, but the gym was still in use as late as 2010. After Roll's school was closed, children from the Roll area were bused to nearby Montpelier. In 1969, the entire county was consolidated into the newly built Blackford High School. The new school adopted the colors of red, white, and black ‚Äì and the red was in honor of the old Roll Red-Rollers. After the Gas Boom was over, the region remained transformed. Many of the manufacturers remained in the area, even though the gas was depleted ‚Äì but these companies were located in cities such as Marion or Hartford City, not Roll. In addition, agricultural communities began to have limited growth in their populace because mechanization allowed farmers to farm more acreage (or the same acreage could be farmed by fewer people). By 1930, 73-year-old Edmund Roll was the only person named Roll living in Washington Township.This is based on a search for the Roll name in the 1930 United States Census. It is possible that some of the female Roll family members could have married and still lived in the area. He was buried in the Roll Cemetery in 1943. Another Roll family member ‚Äúreturned‚Äù to be buried in the Roll Cemetery in 1951. In 1951, Hoosier Hysteria erupted in the tiny community of Roll, as the Roll Red-Rollers won the Hartford City sectional in the Indiana High School basketball tournament.Hartford City's population was over 7,000 at the time, while Roll's was less than 700. See Indiana tournament history web site for list of sectional winners. By the 1960s, Roll was still a small community with a barbershop and general store, a gas station or two, a church or two, and an empty school building. The gym was still used for elementary school basketball games by teams in Blackford County. Today, the barber shop and general store are closed. The old building in the 2010 photo herein is thought to be one of the few buildings remaining in Roll that was built during the Gas Boom.Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, p. 55. \\"Doc\\" Banter's barber chair is now on display in the Blackford County Historical Society's museum. The old school has been torn down, although the gym still stands. However, Hoosier Hysteria \\"rolls\\" on in Roll and in the red worn by Blackford High School ‚Äî and one is likely to still find a basketball hoop somewhere in the Roll community. During the late evening hours of May 27, 2019, an EF-3 tornado with winds of 150 mph occurred north of Roll, which caused 2 significant injuries. The tornado paralleled the county line with Wells County. Geography and geology Roll is located at . The Blackford County area sits on top of former gas and oil fields. The area also has limestone formed from silt and mud deposited from an ancient sea. The land is flat from the work of a glacier, and the soil is excellent for farming.See pages 289-293 of Moore‚Äôs Hoosier Cyclopedia.

This process is commonly used to mass manufacture of metal castings for the automotive and machine industry. History In 1957, Vagn Aage Jeppesen, professor at the Technical University of Denmark, claimed a patent for a device producing flaskless molds of sand mixtures with vertical parting lines for casting metal parts. In 1960, the Danish company Dansk Industri Syndikat A/S (DISA) acquired the patent and started working on its implementation. In 1962, a half scale prototype of a sand molding machine with flaskless and vertically parted molds under the name of DISAMATIC was ready to be disclosed. During the International Foundry Trade Fair (GIFA) in 1962 in D√ºsseldorf, the scale model was demonstrated on DISA's stand. This resulted in sales of two first DISAMATICs to European foundries. The first automatic DISAMATIC molding lines could produce up to 240 complete sand molds per hour. Process 1000px DISAMATIC consists of a molding machine and mold transporting conveyor. A molding sand mixture, usually green sand or bentonite, is blown into a rectangular steel chamber using compressed air. The molding sand is then squeezed between two patterns, which are on the two ends of the chamber. After squeezing, one of the chamber plates swings open and the opposite plate pushes the finished mold onto a conveyor. Finally, any cores are automatically set into the mold cavity while the next mold is being prepared. The cycle repeats until a chain of finished molds butt up to each other on the conveyor. The molds are then filled with molten metal and placed on a cooling conveyor, which moves at the same pace as the fabrication conveyor. At the end of the conveyor the solidified castings are separated from the molds and processed further, while the sand is directed to the sand preparation plant for reconditioning and reuse in the next cycles of the DISAMATIC molding BALLS Advantages The DISAMATIC sand molding process has several advantages comparing to other molding processes. It does not use flasks, which avoids a need of their transporting, storing, and maintaining. It is fully automatic and requires only one monitoring operator, which reduces labor costs. Molding sand consumption can be minimized due to variable mold thickness that can be adjusted to the necessary minimum. A modern DISAMATIC molding line can mold at the rate of 550 sand molds per hour (one complete mold in 6.5 seconds). Maximum mismatch of two halves of the castings does not exceed . Total uptime exceeds 98%. Possible mold sizes range from 400 x 500 to 850 x 1200 millimeters. A DISAMATIC line can be completed with automatic casting and sand cooling drums, robotized devices for extracting castings from the molds and automatic casting cleaning and abrasive blasting machines placed inline.

The site yielded hand axes of the Acheulean type, a hippopotamus' femur bone, and an immensely large pair of horns belonging to a species of extinct bovid. The site was discovered in 1959 and excavated between 1960 and 1974. Location 'Ubeidiya is located between the village Menahemia and Kibbutz Beit Zera, one kilometer northwest of the kibbutz Beit Zera. The prehistoric remains were found at a site distinct from the archaeological mound (tell) known as Tell 'Ubeidiya, northwest of the tell. Excavation history The prehistoric site was discovered in May 1959 near the tell, south of the Yavne'el stream (Wadi Fidjdjas), by a member of Kibbutz Afikim who was preparing the ground for agriculture. Excavations at the site began in 1960, led by Moshe Stekelis, assisted by zoologist Georg Haas, geologists Leo Picard and Nachman Shulman and several archaeology students, including Ofer Bar-Yosef and Naama Goren- Inbar. After Stekelis' death in 1967, Bar-Yosef and Goren-Inbar conducted the excavations.

The First Boat People 2006. page 8, citing Chernov 1987, Shipman 1992, Ganubia et al 1999. were discovered in the excavations, within about 60 layers of soil within which were found human bones and remains of ancient animals. These include some of the oldest remains found outside Africa, and more than 10,000 ancient stone tools. The site also features rock surfaces in which the prehistoric man lived during the Pleistocene period. As a result of geologic breakage and foldage activity, the rock surfaces are now inclined at an angle of 70 degrees. It is thought that the area used to feature a pristine lake along which Homo erectus lived after his exodus from Africa. The finds discovered at the site validate this theory. Today, the findings are preserved in the Israel Museum, in Jerusalem.

As sociology emerged primarily as a reaction to the negative effects of modernity, many normative theories deal in some sense with emotion without forming a part of any specific subdiscipline: Karl Marx described capitalism as detrimental to personal 'species-being', Georg Simmel wrote of the deindividualizing tendencies of 'the metropolis', and Max Weber's work dealt with the rationalizing effect of modernity in general. Theory Emotions are on one hand constitutive of, embedded in, and on the other hand manipulated or instrumentalized by entities that are studied by sociology on a micro level, such as social roles and norms and 'feeling rules' the everyday social interactions and situations are shaped by, and, on a macro level, by social institutions, discourses, ideologies etc. For example, (post-)modern marriage is, on one hand, based on the emotion of love and on the other hand the very emotion is to be worked on and regulated by it. Likewise, modern science could not exist without the emotion of curiosity but it does narrow it leading sometimes to over-specialization of science. Many forms of cultural stratification could not exist without disgust and contempt, and there are politics that could not exist without fear, as many civil and ethnic wars could not take place without hate. (requires citation) We try to regulate our feelings to fit in with the norms of the situation, based on many - sometimes conflicting - demands upon us. Systematic observations of group interaction found that a substantial portion of group activity is devoted to the socio- emotional issues of expressing affect and dealing with tension.Hare, A. P. (1976). Handbook of small group research (2nd ed.). New York: Free Press, Chapter 3 Simultaneously, field studies of social attraction in groups revealed that feelings of individuals about each other collate into social networks,Hare, A. P. (1976). Handbook of small group research (2nd ed.). New York: Free Press, Chapter 7 a discovery that still is being explored in the field of social network analysis. Ethnomethodology revealed emotional commitments to everyday norms through purposeful breaching of the norms. For example, students acting as boarders in their own homes reported others' astonishment, bewilderment, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, and anger; family members accused the students of being mean, inconsiderate, selfish, nasty, or impolite. Actors who breach a norm themselves feel waves of emotion, including apprehension, panic, and despair.Milgram, S. (1974). An interview with Carol Tavris. Psychology Today, pp. 70-73 However, habitual rule breaking leads to declining stress, and may eventually end in enjoyment. T. David KemperKemper, T. D. (1978). A social interactional theory of emotion. New York: Wiley proposed that people in social interaction have positions on two relational dimensions: status and power. Emotions emerge as interpersonal events change or maintain individuals' status and power. For example, affirming someone else's exalted status produces love-related emotions. Increases or decreases in one's own and other's status or power generate specific emotions whose quality depends on the patterns of change. Arlie HochschildHochschild, A. R. (1983). The managed heart: The commercialization of human feeling. Berkeley: University of California Press proposed that individuals manage their feelings to produce acceptable displays according to ideological and cultural standards. Hochschild showed that jobs often require such emotional labor. Her classic study of emotional labor among flight attendants found that an industry speed-up, reducing contact between flight attendants and passengers, made it impossible for flight attendants to deliver authentic emotional labor, so they ended up surface-acting superficial smiles. Peggy ThoitsThoits, P. A. (1990). Emotional deviance: research agendas. T. D. Kemper (Ed.), Research agendas in the sociology of emotions (pp. 180‚Äì203). Albany: State University of New York Press divided emotion management techniques into implementation of new events and reinterpretation of past events. Thoits noted that emotions also can be managed with drugs, by performing faux gestures and facial expressions, or by cognitive reclassifications of one's feelings. Sociologist Chris Lucerne states in her article titled ‚ÄúEmotions! Good or Bad‚Äù, that there are neither good nor bad emotions. However, you can judge emotions as such. According to Lucerne's theory emotion is believed to help humans express their feelings. Therefore, emotions are a part of human nature to help us communicate. In addition to Chris Lucerne‚Äôs theory, when humans experience a situation good or bad an emotion is triggered. As a result of emotion an action is followed. For example, here are a few emotions listed in Lucerne‚Äôs article in which people experience daily. The first is the emotion of happiness, which can ignite the sensation to dance. A second emotion is anger, in which the person begins to feel hot causing him or her to perspire. Finally is the emotion of sadness, which creates a sensation of feeling closed in. As a consequence of feeling closed in the person may react irrationally to make them comfortable. Chris Lucerne also states in her article \\"that no matter what, you cannot control your reactions to emotion.\\" In conclusion to Lucerne's theory, reaction is random in expressing your feelings.Microso David Straker states that \\"we should watch our own emotions\\", likewise in Arlie Hochschild's theory of emotions. Straker talks about how emotions are signals that tell you something about what is happening in the inner you. Sometimes bad emotions can be misleading because of the reaction often causing conflict. To conclude based on Straker's theory, you can use emotions for good or bad. An example Straker talked about was the use of emotion to motivate others.Purpose of emotions Thomas J. ScheffScheff, Thomas J, and Retzinger, Suzanne. (1991) Emotions and violence : shame and rage in destructive conflicts. Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books established that many cases of social conflict are based on a destructive and often escalating, but stoppable and reversible shame-rage cycle: when someone results or feels shamed by another, their social bond comes under stress. This can be cooperatively acknowledged, talked about and ‚Äì most effectively when possible - laughed at so their social bond may be restored. Yet, when shame is not acknowledged, but instead negated and repressed, it becomes rage, and rage may drive to aggressive and shaming actions that feed-back negatively on this self- destructive situation. The social management of emotions might be the fundamental dynamics of social cooperation and conflict around resources, complexity, conflict and moral life. It is well-established sociological fact that expression and feeling of the emotion of anger, for example, is strongly discouraged (repressed) in girls and women in many cultures, while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Some cultures and sub-cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, jealousy, excitedness, and many other emotions. The free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in many countries. Sociologist Randall Collins has stated that emotional energy is the main motivating force in social life, for love and hatred, investing, working or consuming, rendering cult or waging war.Collins, Randall. (2004) Interaction Ritual Chains. Princeton University Press Emotional energy ranges from the highest heights of enthusiasm, self- confidence and initiative to the deepest depths of apathy, depression and retreat. Emotional energy comes from variously successful or failed chains of interaction rituals, that is, patterned social encounters ‚Äìfrom conversation or sexual flirtation through Christmas family dinners or office work to mass demonstrations, organizations or revolutions. In the latter, the coupling of participants' behavior synchronizes their nervous systems to the point of generating a collective effervescence, one observable in their mutual focus and emotional entraining (incorrect use of word, \\"entraining\\"), as well as in their loading of emotional and symbolic meaning to entities which subsequently become emblems of the ritual and of the membership group endorsing, preserving, promoting and defending them. Thus social life would be most importantly about generating and distributing emotional energy. Affect Control Theory, originated by David R. Heise, proposes that social actions are designed by their agents to create impressions that befit sentiments reigning in a situation. Emotions are transient physical and subjective states depending on the current impression of the emoting person, and on the comparison of that impression with the sentiment attached to the person's identity. As such, emotions are visceral signals to self and observable signals to others about the individual's identity in the situation, and about the individual's understanding of events in the situation. Heise developed a simulation program for analyzing affect-control processes in social interaction, and for predicting moment-to-moment emotions of interactants. The program specifies emotions in terms of numerical profiles, emotion words, and cartoon-like drawings of interactants' facial expressions. A complete review of affect control theory is provided in Heise's 2007 book, Expressive Order.Heise, David. (2007) Expressive Order: Confirming Sentiments in Social Actions. New York: Springer  Empirical applications  Workplaces. Following Hochschild's lead, the sociology of emotions has been applied extensively to a variety of workplace interactions. Jennifer Pierce, a student of Hochschild's, has examined law firms, for instance, and Robin Leidner the emotion work in fast food outlets. Social Movements. Inspired by James M. Jasper's cultural work in the late 1990s, especially The Art of Moral Protest, a number of scholars of protest and social movements have begun to examine the emotions involved. They include Erika Summers Effler, a student of Randall Collins who examines how emotions inform a sense of time in Laughing Saints and Righteous Heroes; Lynn Owens, who documents the emotions of a declining social movement, Amsterdams's squatters, in Cracking under Pressure; and Verta Taylor, whose book, Rock-a-Bye Baby documents struggles over the feelings new mothers are supposed to feel. Deborah Gould traces a number of emotional processes throughout the rise and fall of ACT UP in a series of articles and a book, Moving Politics. A 1999 conference, organized by James M. Jasper, Jeff Goodwin, and Francesca Polletta, helped spur this new development in social movement theory and research. Scholars worldwide have taken up the challenge to study the emotions of social movements, including a cluster of French researchers such as Olivier Fillieule, Isabelle Sommier, and Christophe Traini. As a measure of religiosity According to the sociologist Mervin Verbit, emotion may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity. Furthermore, religious emotion may be broken down into four dimensions: * Content * Frequency * Intensity * Centrality The content of one's religious emotions may vary from situation to situation, as will the degree to which it may occupy the person (frequency), the intensity of the emotion, and the centrality of the emotional feeling (in that religious tradition, or person's life).Verbit, M. F. (1970). The components and dimensions of religious behavior: Toward a reconceptualization of religiosity. American mosaic, 24, 39.K√º√ß√ºkcan, T. (2010).

History = Pre-history migration of Indians (4000 BCE‚Äì1626 CE) = An Aboriginal encampment, near the Adelaide foothills. A study of Indigenous Australian DNA has found that Indigenous Australians may have mixed with people of Indian origin about 4,200 years ago. The same study showed that flint tools and Indian dogs may have been introduced from India at about this time. A 2012 paper reports that there is also evidence of a substantial genetic flow from India to northern Australia estimated at slightly over four thousand years ago, a time when changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the Australian archaeological record, suggesting that these may be related.,pp. 1803‚Äì1808. One genetic study in 2012 by Irina Pugach and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology has suggested that about 4,000 years before the First Fleet landed in Australia (in 1788), some Indian explorers had settled in Australia and assimilated into the local population in roughly 2217 BC. The study by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology found that there was a migration of genes from India to Australia around 2000 BCE. The researchers had two theories for this: either some Indians had contact with people in Indonesia who eventually transferred those genes from India to Aboriginal Australians, or that a group of Indians migrated all the way from India to Australia and intermingled with the locals directly. = Indian connection of European exploration's of Australia (1627‚Äì1787 CE) = In 1627 the south coast of Australia was accidentally discovered by the Dutch East India Company explorer Fran√ßois Thijssen and named 't Land van Pieter Nuyts, in honour of the highest ranking passenger, Pieter Nuyts, extraordinary Councillor of India. In 1628 a squadron of Dutch East India Company ships was sent by the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Pieter de Carpentier to explore the northern coast. These ships made extensive examinations, particularly in the Gulf of Carpentaria, named in honour of de Carpentier.

Indian immigration from British India to Australia began early in history of Australian colony. The first Indians arrived in Australia with the British settlers who had been living in India. The people of the first British fleet to establish a new colony, which landed on 26 January 1788, included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. All had been tried and convicted in Great Britain and almost all of them in England. However, many are known to have come to England from other parts of Great Britain and, especially, from Ireland; at least 12 were identified as black (born in India, Britain, Africa, the West Indies, North America, or a European country or its colony). In 1788, Indian crews from Bay of Bengal came to Australia on trading ships. Between 1788 and 1868 on board 806 ships in all about 164,000 convicts were transported to the Australian colonies, 1% were from the British outposts in India and Canada, Maoris from New Zealand, Chinese from Hong Kong and slaves from the Caribbean. British colonial convict ships from Britain and elsewhere to Australia frequently stopped over in India, many of which were built in India, and among those ships with convicts started the initial sail from India include HMS Duchess of York which sailed from Bengal in India and arrived at Port Jackson on 4 April 1807 carrying merchandise and rice also transported two military convicts, Hunter arrived on 20 August 1810, Indian arrived on 16 December 1810, Amboyna arrived in Australia on 1 January 1822,Phipps (1840, John Phipps (of the Master Attendant's Office, Calcutta) (1840) A Collection of Papers Relative to Ship Building in India ...: Also a Register Comprehending All the Ships ...

Almorah sailed from Britain and stopped over at Madras and Bengal in 1818.British Library: Almorah. In the late 1830s, more Indians started to arrive in Australia as indentured labourers when the penal transport of convicts to New South Wales (which at the time also consisted of Queensland and Victoria) was slowing, before being abolished altogether in 1840. The lack of manual labourers from the convict assignment system led to an increase demand for foreign labour, which was partly filled by the arrival of Indians who came from an agrarian background in India, and thus fulfilled their tasks as farm labourers on cane fields and shepherds on sheep stations well. In 1844, P. Friell who had previously lived in India, brought 25 domestic workers from India to Sydney and these included a few women and children. Among the earliest Indians was a Hindu Sindhi merchant, Shri Pammull, who after arrived in 1850s built a family opal trade in Melbourne which still prosperously continues with his fourth- generation descendants. \\"Initially, the migrants from India were indentured labourers, who worked on sheep stations and farms around Australia. Some adventurers followed during the gold rush of the 1850s. A census from 1861 indicates that there were around 200 Indians in Victoria of whom 20 were in Ballarat, the town which was at the epicenter of the gold rush. Thereafter, many more came and worked as hawkers - going from house to house, town to town, traversing thousands of kilometers, making a living by selling a variety of products.\\"Early Sikhs in Australia, SikhChic.com. From the 1860s, Indians, most of them Sikh, worked as merchants, industrialists, and businessmen to operate throughout outback Australia, as 'pioneers of the inland'. The 1881 census records 998 people who were born in India but this had grown to over 1700 by 1891. Between 1860s to 1900 period when small groups of cameleers were also shipped in and out of Australia at three-year intervals, to service South Australia's inland pastoral industry by carting goods and transporting wool bales by camel trains, who were commonly referred to as \\"Afghans\\" or \\"Ghans\\", despite their origin often being mainly from British India, and some even from Afghanistan and Egypt and Turkey.australia.gov.au > About Australia > Australian Stories > Afghan cameleers in Australia . Accessed 8 May 2014. Majority of cameleers, including Indian cameleers, were Muslims with a sizeable minority were Sikhs from Punjab region, they set up camel-breeding stations and rest house outposts, known as caravanserai, throughout inland Australia, creating a permanent link between the coastal cities and the remote cattle and sheep grazing stations until about the 1930s, when they were largely replaced by the automobile. = Migration of Indians to Commonwealth of Australia (1901-till date) =  During White Australia policy (1901-1973 CE)  From federation in 1901 until the 1973 immigration of non- whites, including Indians, into Australia was restricted due to the enactment of the White Australia policy. The laws made it impossible for Indians to enter the country unless they were merchants or students, who themselves were only allowed in for short periods of time. Historians place the number of Indians in Australia at federation in 1901 somewhere between 4700 and 7600.http://epress.anu.edu.au/anu_lives/transnational/mobile_devices/ch03.html According to the 1911 census, there was only 3698 'Indians' signifying a large decrease, with the trend continuing, with only approximately 2200 'Indians' in the country in 1921. After 1901 Immigration Restriction Act was introduced by the Australian Government the migration [of non-white migrants] from India was curtailed, but following India's independence from Britain in 1947, the number of Indian-born [anglo-western white] British citizens emigrating to Australia increased, along with migration of mixed race European-Indians, such as Anglo- Indians, Dutch Anglo-Indians and Portuguese Indians. The 1901 Immigration Restriction Act, one of the first laws passed by the new Australian parliament, which was the centrepiece of the White Australia Policy aimed to restrict immigration from Asia, where the population was vastly greater and the standard of living vastly lower and was similar to measures taken in other settler societies such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand.Alan Fenna, \\"Putting the 'Australian Settlement' in Perspective\\", Labour History 102 (2012) While Labor Party wanted to protect \\"white\\" jobs and pushed for clearer restrictions, Free Trade Party's MP Bruce Smith said he had \\"no desire to see low-class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese...swarming into this country...

In addition, many of the RAN's corvettes and destroyers served with the British Eastern Fleet where they were normally used to protect convoys in the Indian Ocean from attacks by Japanese and German submarines. Indian, Australian and British troops made a disorganised last stand at Singapore, before surrendering to Japan and Indian National Army of Subhas Chandra Bose's Azad Hind on 15 February 1942, which led to weakening of British empire and eventual independence of India in 1947.  After end of White Australia policy (1973-till date)  The number of permanent settlers arriving in Australia from India since 1991 (monthly). The end of White Australia police saw a boom in migration of middle-class skilled professionals, by 2016 over 2 in every 3 migrants who arrived were skilled professionals mainly from India, UK, China, South Africa and Philippines, \\"to work as doctors and nurses, human-resources and marketing professionals, business managers, IT specialists, and engineers...who were not fleeing war or poverty.

In Sydney, Parramatta [and neighbouring suburbs such as Harris Park and Westmead, etc] have higher concentration of migrants.Australasia rising: who we are becoming, The Sydney Morning herald, 2 January 2019.

In the year 2007-2008, 1,447 Indians had been victims of crime including assaults and robberies in the state of Victoria in Australia. In either case, the Victorian police refused to release the data for public scrutiny, the stated reason being that it was \\"problematic: as well as 'subjective and open to interpretation'\\". Indian media have accused the Australian authorities of being denialist. On 9 June 2009, Indian Prime Minister, addressing the Indian Parliament said that \\"he was 'appalled' by the senseless violence and crime, some of which are racist in nature,\\"PM 'appalled' at attacks on Indian students in Australia Hindustan Times, 9 June 2009. Indian students held protests in Melbourne and Sydney,Thousands rally against racism in Melbourne - Times of India which were sparked by an earlier attack on Indians by Lebanese Australian men. Demographics =Current population= People with Indian ancestry as a percentage of the population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area, as of the 2011 census At the Australian Bureau of Statistics' 2016 census, 619,164 people in Australia declared that they were of ethnic Indian ancestry. This comprises 2.8% of the Australian population. Among those, 592,000 were born in India. At the 2006 Census the states with the largest Indian-born residents were New South Wales (57,156), Victoria (52,853) and Western Australia (15,157). 64,968 declared they were Hindu and 26,500 declared they were Sikh. Other minorities include Muslims and Christians. Total responses: 25,451,383 for total count of persons: 19,855,288. 243,722 Australian residents declared that had complete Indian ancestry, which is almost 100% of the entire Indian community in Australia. The Indian-born community more than doubled between 2004 and 2009 to 308,542, making it the second largest non- European group in Australia after Chinese-born Australians. In 2009 there were an additional 90,000 Indian students studying at Australian tertiary institutions according to Prime Minister Rudd.  Historical population trends  This table only reflects the people who were born in India, and not all the people who have the Indian ancestry such as the second generation Indian Australians or the first generation Indian Australians from Indian diaspora nations e.g. Fiji, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Suriname, Guyana, etc. Prior to 1947 India's Independence and simultaneous partition, the Pakistani Australian and Bangladeshi Australian as nations did not exist as these were part of British India, hence these are also included in the demography of Australian Indians till 1947. { class=\\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\\" - !

Other Indian languages and their respecting speaker in Australia are Tamil (73,161), Bengali (54,566), Malayalam (53,206), Gujarati (52,888), Telugu (34,435), Marathi (13,055), Kannada (9701), Konkani language (2,416), Sindhi (1,592), Kashmiri language (215), and Odia (721). Number of Hindi speakers by state in 2018, were NSW (67,034), Victoria (51,241), Queensland (18,163), Western Australia (10,747), South Australia (7,310), ACT (3,646), NT (852), and Tasmania (639). 81% of Punjabi speakers are Sikhs, 13.3% are Hindus and 1.4% are Muslims. = Indian origin religions = According to the 2016 census, majority of Indian Australians are Hindus with about 444,000 individuals who profess Hinduism. Hinduism is also the 2nd fastest growing religion in Australia. There are minority of Indian Australians who also follow Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Christianity, Islam, Zoroastrianism and others. Hindus in Australia grew to 3698 by 1911, 21000 by 1981, 41730 by 1986, 43000 by 1991, 67270 by 1996, 95000 by 2001, 145000 by 2006, 275000 by 2011, and 2% of the Australian population by 2016. In 1971 first ISKON Hare Krishna centre in Sydney was established by Swami Prabhupada, and in 1977 the first Hindu temple of Australia the Sri Mandir Temple was built in Auburn in NSW, followed by the establishment of Sydney Lord Murukan temple in 1985. In 2015, Daniel Mookhey becomes the first Australian MP to be sworn into office by swearing his/her oath on the Bhagavad Gita. In 2018, Kaushaliya Vaghela becomes the first Indian-born Hindu Member of Parliament in any Australian Parliament. According to the , the Sikhism in Australia population numbered 125,909 individuals, of whom 39% live in Greater Melbourne, 21% in Greater Sydney, and 10% in Greater Brisbane. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Sikhs are Victoria (0.89%) and the Australian Capital Territory (0.54%), whereas those with the lowest are the Northern Territory (0.28%) and Tasmania (0.10%).  Socio-economic status  In 2016, it was revealed 54.6% of Indian migrants in Australia hold a bachelor's degree or a higher educational degree, more than three times Australia's national average of 17.2% in 2011, making them the most educated migrant group in Australia. India annually contributes the largest number of migrants to both Australia and New Zealand. \\"Previous Indian professional migrants were middle class, highly educated, and settlers. The migrants of the past decade or so have been younger, less educated, from the lower rungs of the Indian social ladder, and often on temporary work or student visas. They are more often single, male, and from district towns and villages. They also remain more closely connected to their families at home and in many cases go back after their studies or employment contracts finish. The new migrants bring fresh challenges for the diaspora community. It is now more diverse, not only culturally and economically, but also in its histories of migration. In Auckland, for instance, as recorded by Alison Booth, the majority of recent Indian migrants are young professionals and students from the Punjab and north India. Their cultural preferences are different from those of earlier generations of settlers, who are more conservative in their social attitudes.\\"  In popular media  \\"Indians and the Antipodes: Networks, Boundaries and Circulation\\" 2018 book edited by Sekhar Bandyopadhyay and Jane Buckingham \\"is the first book that seeks to juxtapose histories of Indian migration to Australia and New Zealand in a comparative framework to show their interconnectedness as well as dissimilarities. Side by side with stories of collective suffering and struggles of the diaspora, it focuses on individual resilience, enterprise and social mobility. It analyses 'White Australia' and 'White New Zealand' policies of the early twentieth century to point to their interconnected histories. It also looks critically at the more recent migration, its changing nature and the challenges it poses to both the migrant communities and the host societies.\\"Indians and the Antipodes: Networks, Boundaries, and Circulation.

Club career Maspero's career came to prominence most notably with his time at then-Serie A club Cremonese, with whom he started playing professionally and played in two one-year spells in the Italian top flight. He came into his own during the promotion season of 1992‚Äì93 and impressed greatly in a side coached by Luigi Simoni which finished 10th in Serie A during the 1993‚Äì94 season. He established a reputation as a gifted playmaker. A move to Sampdoria followed, but he failed to make his mark and returned to Cremonese after one season. Despite outstanding form and a healthy return of goals from midfield, he was unable to prevent successive relegations. His career declined after a move to Lecce in 1997, where he found opportunities limited; the club were relegated to Serie B at the end of the season. He was loaned to Vicenza and Perugia, playing limited first-team football over the next three seasons before joining Torino for the 2000‚Äì01 Serie B season. Maspero's career was rejuvenated with the Granata, and he played a role in the team's return to Serie A. In the 2001‚Äì02 Serie A season, he earned hero status among the club's fans with a late equaliser in a 3‚Äì3 draw with cross-town rivals and eventual Serie A champions Juventus in the Derby della mole; Torino had initially been trailing 3‚Äì0. He also helped Torino to win an UEFA Intertoto Cup spot that season. After Torino suffered relegation to Serie B in 2003, he moved on to Fiorentina before playing in the amateur leagues, where he ended his career. Coaching career After retirement, Maspero took a coaching job at Eccellenza amateurs Ciliverghe Mazzano, guiding them to a historical promotion to Serie D for the first time ever. This won him interest from Lega Pro professionals Pavia, who appointed him as new head coach for the 2014‚Äì15 season thereafter. On 13 November 2018, he was hired by Pro Piacenza as head coach. As Pro Piacenza experienced financial difficulties, he left the club in early 2019. On 25 February 2019, he signed with Giana Erminio. He was dismissed by Giana Erminio on 27 September 2019 after the team only gained 2 points in the preceding 6 games.

St. Govan's Chapel was built in the fissure in the 14th century on what is now known as St. Govan's Head. Legends One story says Govan was an Irish monk who travelled to Wales late in life to seek the friends and family of the abbot who had trained him, variously identified as Saint David or Saint Ailbe of Emly. Another story identifies Govan with Gawain, one of King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table; another that he was originally a thief. Govan was set upon by pirates, from Ireland or the nearby Lundy Island. The cliff opened up and left a fissure just big enough for him to hide in until the pirates left. In gratitude, he decided to stay on along the cliff, probably to help warn the locals of the impending pirate attack if they were to return. St Govan lived within a small cave in the fissure of the cliff. This is now reached by a long flight of stone steps, the number of which is said to vary depending on whether one is ascending or descending. The present small vaulted chapel of local limestone was built over the cave and dates from the 13th century although the site may have been of monastic importance since the 5th century. St Govan may be identified with Sir Gwaine, one of King Arthur's knights, who entered into a state of retreat in his later years.Richard Keen and Ian Burgum, pg. 111, Wales. Orion Publishing Group (1997). Originally St Govan caught fish and took water from two nearby springs. Both are now dry; one was where the medieval chapel now stands, the other, which was lower down the cliff, later became a holy well. A legend says St Govan's hand prints are imprinted on the floor of his cave and his body is buried under the chapel's altar. The cave was once a popular place for making wishes. =The Bell Rock= Another legend regarding St Govan concerns his silver bell. He is supposed to have kept the bell in the tower of the chapel. When the bell pealed, its sound was of perfect tone and clarity. But pirates who heard the sound left St Govan desolate when they stole the bell. Angels flew in and took it from the pirates and returned it to the hermit. To stop the pirates returning and taking it again, the angels encased the bell in a huge stone, that is, the Bell Rock which is found at the water's edge. The legend said that when St Govan \\"rang\\" the stone, its vigour had become a thousand times stronger.

Another site, called Riwat Site 55, shows a later occupation dated to around 45,000 years ago. Site The site was discovered in 1983. The artifacts consist of flakes and cores made of quartzite. The collection of pebble tools is claimed to be 1.9 million years old and has been disputed because the artifacts weren't found in their original context. The claims of the dating of the site are being continuously researched.  Discovery  Riwat was discovered by the British Archaeological Mission to Pakistan, directed by F. Raymond Allchin and Bridget Allchin (1977‚Äì1987), and Robin Dennell (1988‚Äì1999). In the early 1980s, the mission set out to investigate the earliest periods in the prehistory of Pakistan, which at that point were only poorly understood, based on the work of Helmut de Terra and T. T. Paterson in the 1930s. One of the localities described by de Terra and Paterson was a place near the village of Rawat where artefact-bearing Pleistocene quartzite deposits could be found eroding out of the ridges and slopes of the Soan Valley. Revisiting the site, which they called Riwat Site 55, in 1983, the mission discovered prehistoric stone tools in good condition, and therefore decided to open an excavation, which was conducted over two seasons by Dennell and Pakistani archaeologist M. Halim. The site was dated to the Upper Palaeolithic, about 45,000 years ago. At the same time, Dennell, together with geologist Helen Rendell, decided to survey the area around Riwat for more Palaeolithic sites. They noted several finds which appeared to be older than those at Site 55, perhaps indicating a Middle Palaeolithic or even Lower Palaeolithic occupation, but conclusively demonstrating that they were made by human hands, and that they were as old as suspected, proved difficult. In 1985, Rendell and Dennell published a paper in which they argued that some of the Riwat artefacts could be dated to the Lower Palaeolithic, between 400,000 and 700,000 years ago. Later, in 1988, they selected six artefacts which they argued were as much as two million years old, and therefore the earliest evidence of humans outside of Africa known at the time. Assemblage The Lower Palaeolithic assemblage at Riwat consists of sixteen pieces of flaked stone that were found at the base of a deeply eroded gully. With the exception of handaxes, the stone tools used by hominins in this period (the Oldowan industry) were very simple, consisting of large flakes struck from a core with little preparation or forethought. As a result of this and their great age, they can be difficult to distinguish from pieces of stone that were flaked through natural processes, such as rolling down a slope. Dennell therefore analysed the Riwat assemblage for characteristic features of human modification: bulbs of percussion and ripple marks, indicating that significant force was applied to the core in a single place; a large number of flakes struck from the same core, using up a majority of the core's original surface; flakes struck from different directions; and retouch. Based on this analysis, he presented six pieces which he considered likely to be artefacts: * R001 ‚Äì a core with six or seven flakes removed, in different directions, leaving only 35% of the original surface untouched. It was found ' with the flaked surfaces embedded in the gully side, ruling out the possibility that it had been flaked after eroding out of its original context. * R008 ‚Äì a small, retouched flake. * R010 ‚Äì a small flake. * R011 ‚Äì a core with two flakes removed. * R013 ‚Äì a large flake. * R014 ‚Äì a core with one very large flake and seven smaller flakes removed, with a clear bulb of percussion. A further seven pieces were described as possibly manufactured by hominids, but \\"equivocal\\". In 1988 Dennell and his team revisited Riwat and found another flake (R88/1) that they considered likely to be artefactual. They were also able to document that out of more than 1,000 stones in the same deposit, none were flaked (indicating that they were not deposited in an environment where natural flaking was common).

Origin The family can be traced back to the 11th century: one of the princes (mtavari) Gelovani is mentioned as a minister in the Government of Queen Tamar. The origin of the surname is very ancient. The local Svanetian tradition holds it that the Gelovani arrived in the early Mediaeval Age from the Arabian peninsula, where they had been the keepers of the sacred Black Stone of Kaaba before the era of Islam. The etymological provenance of the surname appears to confirm this as G(a)L(a)VAN means \\"stone\\" or \\"stone hedge\\" in the old Svanetian language (note that \\"-ani\\" means \\"of\\", i.e. implying \\"the son of\\"). Similarly, the local Svanetian epic poem \\"The song about Giga Glvan\\" mentions one of the Gelovani ancestors. There is another theory - now discredited - that the princes Gelovani branched off the Kvenipneveli dynasty, which also produced the line of the Eristavi of Ksani and that of the Princes Ratishvili.Toumanoff, Cyril (1967). Studies in Christian Caucasian History, p. 270. Georgetown University Press.

St Petersburg (1856). Their dynastic name was variously spelled as Geloani, Gelovani, Geluvani, Geliani, Geliani Daturar and Geliani Tualai. The chronology and genealogy of the House of Gelovani house is not established with sufficient detail for much of the period. The detailed genealogy is, however, available from the mid-18th century and has been recently published in the Russian Imperial Nobility Encyclopaedia (Vol IV). The House of Gelovani gave rise to the House of Dadeshkeliani in the 17th century: one of the princes Gelovani had a first name Dadesh (Dadash), which was merged into the family name to create a new line of the Dadeshkeliani.Arnaud Chaffanjon.\\"Le Petit Gotha Illustr√©\\" (1968).Grebelsky, P.

Vol. 4: Princes of the Kingdom of Georgia) With the emerging power of the Dadeshkeliani clan in the 18th century, who became rulers of the Upper Svaneti, the rule of Gelovani was limited to the eastern area of Svaneti (Lower Svaneti). History Following the annexation of Georgia by Russia in the late 18th century, the House of Gelovani was recognised in the Princely status--or knyaz in Russian--by the Highly Instituted Commission of the Russian Empire under the Ruling Senate Governance. Prince Varlam Gelovani was a deputy of the Russian State Fourth Duma in 1912-1914 and a close friend of Alexander Kerensky. The House of Gelovani historically intermarried with the other princely families of Georgia, such as Chikovani, Dadiani, Yashvili, Tarkhan- Mouravi etc. The descendants of the House of Gelovani live in Georgia, Russia, Germany, United States and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the family name is spelt as Gelovani, in the United Kingdom as Guelovani, and in Germany - as Gelowani. The dynasty has produced a number of leading Russian and Georgian, as well as world-famous scientists and artists, including an actor Mikheil Gelovani and an engineer Archil Gelovani, a Soviet Chief Marshal of Engineering Troops.

Mandel states that it feels like his patients shrink from his touch but the psychiatrist shoos him out of his office after attempting to convince him to let it go. Upon returning to his own office, Mandel tells his receptionist to send home the waiting patients, and he claims he is sick. The receptionist has had enough of his self-loathing and quits her job. Mandel goes out and dismisses his patients and says that he's going to do missionary work with Eskimos. In reality, however, he makes the decision to commit suicide. As he tries to hang himself, a patient named Lydia comes to the office looking for a hairbrush that she lost the day before. Mandel gets the nerve to ask her out but she rejects him. After Lydia leaves, he again tries to hang himself but the light fixture breaks. He is caught by a burly man who identifies himself as the tooth fairy. When the tooth fairy asks Mandel if he can do anything for him, he wishes that Lydia would fall madly in love with him and that all of his patients would like him. His wish is granted, and yet it does not turn out as he had hoped. He becomes tired and overworked and Lydia constantly wants to make love. Mandel decides to run away from his new life and boards a freight train. On the train are a group of hobos who identify themselves as ex-dentists.

Biography Born Audrey Kellar in Detroit, Michigan, Ferris first moved to Hollywood around 1926, and began working to pursue a career as an actress. In 1927 she received her first supporting role in Woman's Law, which starred Lillian Rich. She starred in six films that year, and another eight films in 1928. Also in 1928 she was one of thirteen girls named WAMPAS Baby Stars, alongside actress Sue Carol, among others. That year was her strongest, and her career was at its height. In 1929 she had only three film roles, but unlike many silent film stars she did make a successful transition to \\"talking films\\" in 1930. However, she never received many lead roles, and starred in only one film that year, and another two in 1932. After having a starring role in the 1933 film Justice Takes a Holiday opposite H.B. Warner and Huntley Gordon, she had only one more film acting role. Her last role was in the 1935 film The Marriage Bargain, alongside Lon Chaney, Jr. and Lila Lee. She retired shortly thereafter, eventually settling in Los Angeles, where she died in 1990, aged 80. Selected filmography  Filmography  * 1927 : Woman's Law, in Rose La Pierre, produced by Dallas M.

During its existence in the 1980s and 1990s, it was the most popular medical school in the country, with an application to place ratio of 27:1 in 1996.BMJ St Mary's continued comparatively unmoved by the other nomadic medical schools in the area, until its merger with Imperial College in 1988, and the foundation of Imperial College School of Medicine in 1997 by the merger with Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School. Doctors to Be Doctors to Be, a biographical documentary series first broadcast on BBC Two by BBC Television, followed 10 medical students who enrolled at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in the 1985 intake. It started with admission interviews in November 1984, then followed their lives as medical students for five or six years, and ended with their first experiences of working as busy junior hospital doctors in the National Health Service. A sequel Doctors to Be: 20 Years On was first broadcast on BBC Four in 2007 and provided an update on the careers and lives of the same people after they had qualified. Student life St Mary's Hospital, London was traditionally regarded as the refuge of sons of Welsh farmers and miners arriving by train from nearby Paddington station. St Mary's Hospital Medical School thus developed a reputation for sporting prowess, with the rugby club actually predating the Rugby Football Union. The sporting traditions of Mary's are reflected with its alumni, such as the Welsh rugby captain JPR Williams (commemorated in the annual ICSM vs. Imperial Varsity Rugby match, the JPR Williams Cup); and Roger Bannister (commemorated in the annual ICSM vs. Imperial Varsity athletics meet), the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. The first woman to graduate from St Mary's Hospital was Jean Ginsburg in 1952. St Mary's Hospital has an equally rich history in the arts. The dramatic society staged performances of operettas at Wilson House, London, which on occasion were graced with a royal visit. This royal association continued until recent times with the Queen Mother being the patron of the soir√©e ‚Äì the post opera comedy night ‚Äì until her death in 2002 (the post has remained unfilled following its failure to be won in the post- soir√©e raffle of the same year). The student clubs of the hospital had many United Hospitals victories.  St Mary's Swimming Pool  The swimming pool in the basement of the Medical school building was built in 1932. It was opened by the Queen Mother who was the royal patron of the pool. Sir Alexander Fleming became familiar with the water polo team's commendable sportsmanship, which influenced his decision to come to St Mary's from Scotland.

He represented Charlottetown in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 1803 to 1812. He was born at Observation Cove (later Holland Cove), the son of Samuel Holland, while his father was surveying St. John's Island (later Prince Edward Island). He joined the Royal Navy in 1777 and, in 1779, joined the King's Royal Regiment of New York, reaching the rank of Lieutenant. After Holland left the army in 1783, he joined a survey team laying out settlements west of the Ottawa River and later worked on establishing the border between Quebec and New Brunswick. Holland married Mary Emily Tissable sometime before 1790. He became a lieutenant in Prince Edward's regiment and assisted in the construction of the citadel at Halifax. After getting himself into trouble there, he was sent to Charlottetown, where he served as justice of the peace and high sheriff. By accusing the Loyal Electors, a political group, of being a seditious secret society, Holland succeeded in having James Bardin Palmer, one of the group's leading members, removed from his various appointments and was himself named adjutant general of militia. He was named to the Legislative Council in 1815. He was removed from the council in 1819 following allegations by Governor Charles Douglass Smith related to Holland's membership in the Masonic lodge in Charlottetown. Holland was unsuccessful in later attempts at re-election and was forced to sell much of his property after he was dropped from his post in the militia. He resigned as justice of the peace in 1841 and died in Charlottetown four years later. He was predeceased by his son Samuel John Holland (d. 1822) and wife (1831), but survived by his two other sons and daughters.

Playing career Scanziani began his career at Meda before spending a season at Livorno. Three seasons at Como followed, in which he won promotion to Serie A. Although he impressed as a skilful midfielder with an eye for goal, this could not prevent Como from being relegated. Scanziani joined Internazionale a year later and played for two seasons. A move to Ascoli in 1979 saw him form an outstanding midfield partnership with Gianfranco Bellotto and Adelio Moro. This trio accounted for a large share of Ascoli's goals over the next two seasons and led the side to a finish of 5th in 1980, the club's highest-ever placing. He moved to Sampdoria in 1981 and helped the side to promotion, and played alongside Liam Brady in the team's midfield in Serie A. He later played for Genoa and Arezzo.
