It lies approximately southwest of Meroe on the western side of the Nile, near the sixth cataract. A number of large tumuli were found at el-Hobagi from the period after the fall of the Meroitic kingdom, but before the Christianization of Nubia. The site, which is dated to the 4th century, is situated near a post-Meroitic cemetery. Grave mounds excavated by a French team revealed an absence of rich gifts, instead containing weapons such as swords, spears, axes, arrows and bows. The dead lay on a bed and were surrounded by numerous vessels. There was also a bronze bowl, which contains one of the last known Meroitic inscriptions; it is decorated with agricultural scenes and the word Qore (\\"King\\"). This suggests that local kings were buried here in the wake of the Meroitic kingdom. Some findings suggest that the King's court was moved to the area of el-Hobagi in the 4th century AD, though no village of that era has been found here. Tumulus III at El Hobagi is believed to date to the early Postmeroitic period of the late 4th century.

He is known as an innovator in Be-bop and hand drumming, and has been nominated for two Grammy awards. He is also a visual artist, working as a painter. Life and career Robert Thomas Jr. was born in Miami, the eldest of seven children, and grew up in North Miami Beach. He was encouraged by his fifth- grade teacher to play music, and not having an instrument, Thomas learned to play percussion on his desk. He sang in the choir at Oak Grove Missionary Baptist Church, and at age sixteen, began playing percussion with the Broomfield Family, a local group that performed in churches and nightclubs. He joined the ensemble as a roadie, but after playing percussion with the group at a private party, went on to play in the band. Although still under-age, he played with the group at such venues as the Castaway Hotel's Wreck Bar. After graduating from high school, Thomas studied at Miami-Dade Community College. During this time, he discovered jazz, and began to play with saxophonist Jet Nero at the Gold Dust lounge and other artists including Ira Sullivan, Billy Marcus, Zoot Sims, Thad Jones, Monty Alexander and Mel Lewis. In the late 70s, Thomas played at a benefit with Jaco Pastorius in Miami Springs. Soon afterward, Thomas auditioned with Joe Zawinul and Wayne Shorter's jazz fusion group Weather Report at a live performance in New Haven, Connecticut. Thomas said afterward that they were looking for someone to play Be-bop, rather than Latin-style percussion. He settled in France, and continued to play with Weather Report until 1986. After the group disbanded, Thomas resettled in Miami, and shortly afterward issued a solo CD of his own music In the Dreamtime on a local label. He continued to work with Zawinul until 1994. Besides Weather Report, Thomas played with The Zawinul Syndicate, Jaco Pastorius' Word of Mouth band, and individual artists including Stan Getz, David Sanborn, Carlos Santana, Eddie Harris, Branford Marsalis, Herbie Mann, Ahmad Jamal and Roberto Perera. World artists he has played with include sitar player Amitava Chatterjee, and African artist Vinx. Thomas maintains an extensive discography and has issued several solo CDs. on which he plays an eclectic mix of instruments including conga drums, wind instruments, guitar and the African bow harp.

The Sportsplex was built by the City of Brandon in the mid 1970s as a venue for the 1979 Canada Winter Games. It features an indoor ice hockey arena, a 50 metre swimming pool, racquetball courts, and track and field facilities. Since the 1979 Winter Games, the Sportsplex has been made available to the public for recreational use. The hockey arena is one of four indoor arenas that serve the city of Brandon, the other three being located within the Keystone Centre. The Sportsplex is home to the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Midget 'AAA' Hockey League and is also used by the city's minor hockey, speed skating, and figure skating programs. The Sportsplex was once again used as a venue for the Canada Games in 1997 when Brandon hosted the Summer Games. In preparation for the games, its facilities received extensive upgrades. The swimming pool was slated for closure in 2011, but after public pressure to keep it open, Brandon city council decided not to close the pool. As a result, the city now has two pools, the other being at the local YMCA. The pool was later deemed inadequate by the Canada Games Council for the 2017 Canada Summer Games. As city council decided not to upgrade or expand the Sportsplex, the city's bid for the 2017 Games was rejected.

Nearly identical facilities were constructed at many other SAC bases, such as Barksdale Air Force Base, Robins Air Force Base, McCoy Air Force Base. A mole hole, officially designated the Readiness Crew Building (RCB), is a type of structure built by the United States Air Force at former Strategic Air Command (SAC) bases around the country during the 1950s and 1960s. RCBs were located adjacent to an Alert Ramp, also called a \\"Christmas Tree\\", where Ready Alert aircraft were parked. These aircraft were initially Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft armed with nuclear weapons, augmented by Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter aerial refueling aircraft. As SAC introduced newer bomber and aerial tanker aircraft into its inventory, the B-47 and KC-97 were later superseded by Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, Convair B-58 Hustler, General Dynamics FB-111 or Rockwell B-1 Lancer bombers, augmented by Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker or McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender aerial refueling aircraft. History Due to aircraft being parked at the \\"Christmas Tree\\" being on constant alert duty, the Strategic Air Command realized that they needed specialized buildings to house crews who rotated on alert duty. In 1958, Leo A Daly, an architect from Omaha, Nebraska, was hired to design buildings that would respectively hold 70, 100, and 150 men. These standardized structures would eventually be nicknamed \\"mole holes\\" due to the fact that the men would run out onto the \\"Christmas Tree\\" through corrugated steel tunnels attached to the lower level of the building when the alert Klaxon sounded. The buildings would house readiness crews and contained thick concrete exteriors, bathrooms, a briefing room for crew members, dormitories, several classrooms, a kitchen and a dining facility. Since crews were typically assigned on alert for seven-day periods, some installations would later incorporate outdoor athletic facilities on site, such as baseball fields or swimming pools, as well as picnic facilities where families could visit crewmembers on duty. Crews on alert duty would typically be on alert for seven days out of a 21-day period, while being on rotational alert duty. During their alert duty, they would fly no training missions, as they were to be kept always ready for an operational launch in the event of a nuclear strike. During an alert scramble, flight crews and ground crews would run out to the \\"Christmas Tree\\", where they would travel on foot and/or by waiting alert vehicles to the alert bomber and tanker aircraft that were waiting to launch, typically between four and nine in number. Once all engines were started, the aircraft would perform an elephant walk to the runway, where a Minimum Interval Takeoff (MITO) might be performed. Over the course of their construction, eleven facilities to house 150 people were built. These were supplemented by an additional ten facilities for housing 100 men, and 45 facilities for housing 70 men at a total of 65 SAC bases, other USAF bases where a SAC wing was a tenant command, and Royal Canadian Air Force bases where an SAC wing was present. The facilities replaced various facilities that housed crew members earlier, including house trailers, which sat next to the aircraft.  Locations  US Army Corps of Engineers shows the \\"molehole\\" corrugated steel tunnel attached to the housing complex. Readiness Crew Buildings designed to accommodate 150 Airmen were located at the following Air Force Bases: * Bunker Hill AFB (Indiana) * Forbes AFB (Kansas) * Hunter AFB (Georgia) * Lincoln AFB (Nebraska) * This photograph is an example of a 150 man molehole located at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Notice the corrugated steel tunnels that appear on the front and the side of the building, allowing for rapid egress in the event of an alert. Lockbourne AFB (Ohio) * Malmstrom AFB (Montana) * Mountain Home AFB (Idaho) * Pease AFB (New Hampshire) * Plattsburgh AFB (New York) * R.I. Bong AFB (Wisconsin) * Whiteman AFB (Missouri) Readiness Crew Buildings designed to accommodate 100 Airmen were located at the following Air Force Bases: * Chennault AFB (Louisiana) * Clinton County AFB (Ohio) * Davis-Monthan AFB (Arizona) * Dyess AFB (Texas) * Homestead AFB (Florida) * Little Rock AFB (Arkansas) * MacDill AFB (Florida) * March AFB (California) * McCoy AFB (Florida) * Homestead Air Force Base, shows that in some cases, external factors forced the Army Corps of Engineers to modify their plans to accommodate for local restrictions. In the case of this RBC, the building was built entirely above ground, and then the main floor was protected with an earthen berm. The first floor exits, rather than being tunneled, were simply concrete trenches. Selfridge AFB (Michigan) Readiness Crew Buildings designed to accommodate 70 Airmen were located at the following Air Force Bases: * Altus AFB (Oklahoma) * Amarillo AFB (Texas) * Barksdale AFB (Louisiana) * Beale AFB (California) * Bergstrom AFB (Texas) * Biggs AFB (Texas) * Blytheville AFB (Arkansas) * Carswell AFB (Texas) * Castle AFB (California) * Clinton-Sherman AFB (Oklahoma) * Columbus AFB (Mississippi) * Dow AFB (Maine) * Dover AFB (Delaware) * Eglin AFB (Florida) * Ellsworth AFB (South Dakota) * Fairchild AFB (Washington) * Glasgow AFB (Montana) * Grand Forks AFB (North Dakota) * Griffiss AFB (New York) * Kinross AFB (Michigan) * K.I.

Meem's men participated in Stonewall Jackson's attacks on the towns of Romney and Bath, later Berkeley Springs, now in West Virginia in early January 1862. After the brigade went into winter quarters in Martinsburg, now West Virginia, Meem resigned his commission on February 1, 1862, then served in the Shenandoah County, Virginia local government during the war and in the Virginia Senate following the war, before moving to Seattle, Washington and becoming its postmaster in the administration of President Grover Cleveland, where he became a prominent citizen before his death. Early life Gilbert S. Meem was born in Abingdon, Virginia on October 5, 1824 to the former Eliza Russell and her husband John Gaw Meem, a Lynchburg, Virginia banker. John Gaw Meem owned 20 enslaved people in Lynchburg, Campbell County, Virginia in the 1850 Federal census, ranging from 65, 55 and 40 year old black men and a 40 year old mulatto woman to two girl and one boy year-old babies.1850 Slave Schedule of U.S.Federal Census for Lynchburg, Campbell County, Virginia, page of 34 of 41 on ancestry.com; the 1860 slave schedules are not online but ancestry.com indicates John G.

He He married Nannie Rose Garland, which resulted in future Confederate States Army Brigadier General Samuel Garland and Lieutenant General James Longstreet becoming relatives. Career Meem became an accomplished livestock breeder as well as a planter. He won election as a Democrat alongside and served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1852‚Äì1854 before the pair lost their bid for re-election to the men then had defeated in 1851.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) pp. American Civil War service Gilbert S. Meem was a brigadier general of the 7th Brigade in the 3rd Division of Brigadier General James Harvey Carson in the Virginia militia at the outbreak of the Civil War. Along with Carson's men, Meem's brigade was part of the garrison at Harpers Ferry after it was captured by the pro-Confederate Virginia force in April 1861. Meem's brigade guarded Winchester, Virginia when then Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston's men moved to support Confederate forces at the First Battle of Bull Run. At least part of Meem's brigade remained on duty throughout 1861. In November 1861, Meem's men were called by Stonewall Jackson for training at Winchester, Virginia and duty in the Valley District. In early January, Jackson moved against the Union held towns of Romney and Bath (Berkeley Springs) and occupied those towns. Meem's men advanced with Jackson's main body. They performed poorly at Bath, falling back under fire and failing to block the Union force's route of retreat as Jackson drove them out of town from the other side. After Jackson took possession of the two main towns in the area, which overextended him and which he could not maintain after a few weeks, Meem's men were sent south and east to Martinsburg, Virginia, now West Virginia, to guard the rear of Jackson's army and to go into winter quarters. On February 1, 1862, Meem resigned his commission. The resignation appears to have been under pressure after General Robert E. Lee received reports that Meem's habits and daily condition, apparently alcohol abuse, made him unfit for command. Meem returned to his estate and also held various positions in the Shenandoah County, Virginia government for the remainder of the war. Later life After the war, Meem continued to manage his estate Shenandoah County's Mount Airy area. He received recognition for his breeding operations which helped introduce and improve fine cattle and sheep into the Shenandoah Valley. Meem won election to the Virginia State Senate in 1870, and represented Shenandoah and adjoining Page County from 1871 to 1875. He published a booklet titled: Catalogue of short horned cattle, on exhibition and for sale at the National Fair, Washington, D.C. New Market, Henkel and Co., printers, 1888, .Shaffer, 2012, p. 51. In 1892, Meem sold his Mount Airy property and moved to Seattle, Washington. President Grover Cleveland appointed him postmaster of Seattle after his move.Allardice, 1995, p. 166. Meem served in that office until 1899, becoming a well-known citizen of the city. Gilbert S. Meem died on June 10, 1908 in Seattle. He is buried in Lake View Cemetery at Seattle. His son, Gilbert S.

Background and writing After their last official cross-Canada tour ended in 2000, Platinum Blonde's frontman Mark Holmes released a solo album and worked as a DJ at The Mod Club in Toronto, Ontario. In 2010, Holmes decided the time was right to renew the band: \\"All the bands that I was doing remixes for lately seem to sound like Platinum Blonde. So I thought it might be the right time for a dose of the real thing.\\" In 2010, Holmes invited bassist Rob Laidlaw (known for his work with Honeymoon Suite) to join the band and hooked back up with co founding member Sergio Galli (Guitar). This is the lineup that is touring the new material in 2012. Holmes was inspired by MacLean during the development of the album: \\"He [MacLean] may not have been writing or doing those backing vocals, but when I think of backing vocals, I think of him. Close my eyes, think what would he do? I try to do it.\\" Release and promotion On August 20, 2012 the band appeared on Citytv's Breakfast Television in Toronto to promote the new album.

History In 1860, bishop Motiejus Valanƒçius began preparations for construction of a new church in Panevƒó≈æys. However, after the Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist authorities implemented Russification policies, including the Lithuanian press ban and suppression of the Catholic Church. The authorities forbade construction of any new Catholic churches and closed the Piarist church leaving only the Church of Saints Peter and Paul to service the Catholic inhabitants of Panevƒó≈æys. A permission for construction was obtained in 1904, but the work was delayed by the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905 until 1908. Until World War I, a rectory and a temporary chapel were completed while church's walls rose up to the windows. The church was to be named after Saint Stanislaus the Martyr. After the war the construction was abandoned until April 1926 when Pope Pius XI established the Roman Catholic Diocese of Panevƒó≈æys. Architect Rytis Steik≈´nas and engineer Aleksandras Gordeviƒçius redesigned and expanded the church as it now was to serve as a cathedral. The unfinished cathedral was blessed by Jonas Maƒçiulis (better known as Maironis) on Saint Casimir's Day (March 4) in 1930. For that occasion Maironis wrote a hymn dedicated to Christ the King. Four bells from Apolda, Germany, were blessed in 1931. The largest, weighing , is dedicated to Christ the King. The organ, produced by Bruno Goebel in K√∂nigsberg, has three manuals. The cathedral was consecrated during a Eucharistic Congress on June 30, 1933, by Juozapas Skvireckas, Archbishop of Kaunas. The interior was decorated by local painter Povilas Puzinas in 1938‚Äì1939. Architecture Panevƒó≈æys Cathedral side-altar The cathedral is eclectic combining features of Baroque and Neoclassicism. The fa√ßade is dominated by the rectangular tower topped with an octagonal dome. Two high sculptures of Pope Pius XI and Jurgis Matuleviƒçius, founders of the diocese, stand on the corners of the roof. The pediment of the portico is decorated with cartouches: the top one features a royal crown while the lower has the coat of arms of the bishop. The cathedral has three naves with groin vaults built of reinforced concrete. Chapel of Saint Casimir occupies a large hall under the presbytery, which is also known as the catacombs. The monstrance was gifted by Pope Pius XI. The church tabernacle is made of gilded oak. Two small angels, made by Joseph Rifesser from Urtij√´i, are kneeling on each side. Above it there is a white sculpture of Christ the King by Juozas Zikaras. The richly decorated baldachin of the altar rests on four white columns, surrounded by sculptures of angels. The ceiling of the apse is decorated by a fresco by Jonas Mackeviƒçius depicting Saint Casimir appearing to Lithuanian soldiers during the 1518 Siege of Polotsk. The fresco was restored in 2002. The walls of the apse depict ten churches of ten deaneries of the diocese. The side aisles end with oak altars produced by Joseph Rifesser. The left altar features a copy of the Sistine Madonna and a painting of Saint Casimir surrounded by sculptures of Albert of Riga and Saint Monica. The right altar features a sculpture of Saint Francis of Assisi helping crucified Jesus, modeled after a painting by Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, and a painting of Saint Stanislaus. Puzinas painted the ceiling vaults with frescoes of angels in the clouds while ceiling of the chapels was decorated with images of the Four Evangelists. He also created eight large paintings that hang in the naves.

During this period, artists of New Spain experimented with expressive, contrasting, and realistic creative approaches, making art that became highly popular in New Spanish society. Among notable artworks are polychrome sculptures, which as well as the technical skill they display, reflect the expressiveness and the colour contrasts characteristic of New Spanish Baroque. Two styles can be traced in the architecture of New Spain: the Salom√≥nico, developed from the mid-17th century, and the Est√≠pite, which began in the early 18th century. A model of the Cathedral of Puebla represents the architectural magnificence of New Spain. A choir book and a harpsichord of the 18th century highlight the importance of music for the colonial society of the Baroque period in Mexico. Painting In the realm of painting, New Spanish baroque had great artists whose works are in museums such as the Museum of the Viceroyalty in Tepotzotl√°n, El Carmen Museum in San √Ångel, Santa M√≥nica Museum in Puebla, and Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City. Among the most distinguished artists were: *Miguel Cabrera *Juan Correa *Crist√≥bal de Villalpando *Sim√≥n Pereyns =Sim√≥n Pereyns= Sim√≥n Pereyns lived in Antwerp circa 1530 then Mexico circa 1600. He was a Flemish painter and in 1558, he moved to Lisbon and then to Madrid, where he worked as a court artist. In 1566, he went to New Spain, achieved fame with his paintings in Mexico. Many works are attributed to him, but most of them have been lost; among those conserved are the ten tables of the altarpiece of Huejotzingo (1586), which revealed the influence of D√ºrer and his work on Saint Christopher (1585). Pereyns was put on trial on religious charges. His beliefs were inherited from his ancestors, specifically his father, who was a Lutheran. While he was in prison, he painted a picture called \\"Our Lady of Atonement\\", hoping to win a pardon. He was released and donated the painting to the Archbishop of Mexico, whose successors mounted it on the Altar del Perd√≥n at the Metropolitan Cathedral. =Juan Correa= Juan Correa (1646-1716) was a Novohispanic painter active between 1676 and 1716. His painting covers topics both religious and secular. One of his best works is considered to be the \\"Assumption of the Virgin\\" in the Cathedral of Mexico City; several of his works depicting Our Lady of Guadalupe found their way to Spain.The Virgin of Guadalupe, a painting by the colonial artist Juan Correa colonial-mexico.com He also made paintings of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Rome in 1669. =Crist√≥bal de Villalpando= Church of Santa Prisca in Taxco by Crist√≥bal de Villalpando. Some of Crist√≥bal de Villalpando's (c. 1649-1714) early work dates from 1675 with the high altar of the Franciscan convent of St. Martin of Tours in Huaquechula, where there are 17 of his paintings; but that is not necessarily the beginning of his career. It is likely that the painter was born in Mexico City in 1649. Little is known about his childhood and adolescence, the earliest documented date being his wedding in 1669. He married Mar√≠a de Mendoza, with whom he had four children. Undoubtedly, Villalpando was one of the foremost painters of Mexico City during the latter part of the 17th century, as evidenced by the collection of triumphal paintings that were commissioned by the council of the Cathedral of Mexico, for decorating the walls of the sacristy of the church. The canvases prepared for that commission were: The Triumph of the Catholic Church, The Triumph of St. Peter, St. Michael's victory (known as Woman of the Apocalypse) and the appearance of St. Michael on Mount Gargano. Unfortunately, due to structural faults in the vaults of the building, Villalpando was unable to complete the intended set of six paintings; they were completed by Juan Correa. Due to this hindrance to his work at Mexico City, Villalpando moved to Puebla de los √Ångeles where he carried out similar work at the Cathedral there. He produced a well-known oil painting titled \\"Glorification of the Virgin\\", in the dome of the Chapel de Los Reyes located in the end wall of the church. It is also worth noting the amount of his work found in the church of the Profesa in Mexico City. His importance was recognized by the painters' guild, of which he became leader on several occasions. He reached old age with a great reputation, and he was recognized as an important stylistic influence on later generations. He is considered one of the last exponents of Baroque painting in New Spain: after his death New Spanish plastic art took a different path. St. Gertrude the Great, portrait by Miguel Cabrera. =Miguel Cabrera= Miguel Cabrera (1695-1768) was an extraordinarily prolific artist, specialising in depictions of the Virgin Mary and other saints. He is regarded as the leading colourist of the 18th century. His paintings were very much in demand: many requests for pictures came from convents, churches, palaces, and noble houses. Writing and Philosophy A wide range of poets and writers fell within the New Spanish Baroque tradition. =Gutierre de Cetina= Portrait of Gutierre de Cetina. Gutierre de Cetina (1520 - 1557) was a Spanish poet of the Renaissance and the Spanish Golden Age. He was born in Seville, Spain and died in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Of a noble and wealthy family, he lived for a long time in Italy, where he was a soldier under the command of Charles I. Spending much time in the court of the Prince of Ascoli, to whom he dedicated numerous poems, and also associated with Luis de Leyva and distinguished humanist and poet Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. He adopted the nickname \\"Vandalio\\" and composed a song in the Petrarchan style to a beautiful woman named Laura Gonzaga. To such a woman was dedicated the famous madrigal that has been included in all anthologies of poetry in the Spanish language: > Eyes clear, calm, Since you are praised for your tender gaze, Why, when you > look at me, do you look angry? In the same songbook there are many sonnets whose pattern was essentially the rendering of a loving thought of Petrarch or Ausi√†s March in the quartets, and a further, more personal development in the tercets. In 1554 Cetina returned to Spain and in 1556 went to Mexico; he had previously been there between 1546 and 1548, with his uncle Gonzalo Lopez, who had gone there as chief accountant. He fell in love again, with Leonor de Osma, and was mortally wounded in 1557 in Puebla de los Angeles by an envious rival, Hernando de Nava. =Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n y Mendoza= Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n y Mendoza (c.1581 - 1639) was born in Taxco. He was a Novohispanic writer of the Golden Age who developed various forms of drama. His works include the comedy \\"La Verdad Sospechosa\\" (Suspicious Truth), which is one of the most important works of Spanish American Baroque theater, comparable to the best pieces of Lope de Vega or Tirso de Molina. Little is known about the early life of Ruiz de Alarc√≥n. It is known that his maternal grandfather was Jewish and his paternal grandfather was the son of a priest of La Mancha and a Moorish slave. It is probable that he came from a family well connected with the Castilian nobility. He studied from 1596 to 1598 in the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. About 1600 he set off for the University of Salamanca, where he studied civil law and specialized in canon law. While in Salamanca, Alarc√≥n rose to prominence as the author of dramas and stories. In 1606 he went to Seville in order to practice commercial and canonical law. There, he met Miguel de Cervantes, who was subsequently influenced by his works, including La cueva de Salamanca (The Cave of Salamanca) and \\"El Semejante A S√≠ Mismo\\" (Like unto Himself). Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n. In the first months of 1607 he returned to New Spain. Two years later he obtained a bachelor's degree in law and several times tried unsuccessfully to gain a university chair. His next move was to Madrid, where he began the most fruitful period of his literary output. His early works were \\"Las Paredes Oyen\\" (Walls Have Ears) and \\"Los Pechos Privilegiados\\" (The Privileged), both meeting with some success. He soon came to be recognised in literary circles in Madrid, but never established close relations with any of their members. Indeed, he earned the hostility of others. We know of many satirical quatrains and disguised allusions to Alarc√≥n, who was always ridiculed for his physique - he was a hunchback - and his American origins. He, in turn, responded to the vast majority of personal attacks and never stopped writing. It has been suggested that he may have collaborated with Tirso de Molina, one of the most famous writers of his time and the one who most influenced his works. There are no written evidence of such a collaboration, although it is thought that at least two of the comedies of Tirso, published in the second volume of his works (Madrid, 1635), were in fact written by or with the collaboration of Alarc√≥n. With the accession of Philip IV, in 1621, the theater achieved an important place in the royal court. Alarc√≥n soon struck up a useful friendship with the son-in-law of the powerful Gaspar de Guzm√°n, Count-Duke of Olivares, Ramiro Felipe de Guzm√°n, under whose patronage he grew better-known as a poet. Between 1622 and 1624 he wrote \\"La Amistad Castigada\\" (Punished Friendship) and \\"El due√±o de las estrellas\\" (The Owner of the Stars) as well as the vast majority of his plays. From 1625 he served on the Council of the Indies, thanks to the intercession of his friend Ramiro Felipe de Guzm√°n. During the first months of 1639, Alarc√≥n's health began to deteriorate. He stopped attending the council's meetings and was replaced in his position as rapporteur. In August he dictated his will, making provision for all his debts and debtors. He died on August 4, 1639 and was buried in the parish of San Sebasti√°n. =Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora= Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora (1645 - 1700) was the youngest son of eight children and was related to the famous Baroque Culteranismo poet Luis de G√≥ngora. His father was a tutor to the royal family in Spain; after he emigrated to the New World he joined the bureaucracy of the viceroyalty. In 1662, Sig√ºenza entered the Jesuit college of Tepotzotl√°n to begin his religious studies, which he continued in Puebla. In 1667 he was expelled from the order for indiscipline. He returned to Mexico City and entered the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico. In 1672 he took the post of professor of mathematics and astrology, the position that Diego Rodr√≠guez had occupied thirty years before. Sig√ºenza held this position for the next twenty years. In 1681, he wrote a book, \\"A Philosophical Manifesto\\", concerning comets, in an attempt to calm the superstitious fears arising from this cosmic phenomenon. A Jesuit, Eusebio Kino, strongly criticized this text from an Aristotelian and Thomistic point of view; but, far from being intimidated, Sig√ºenza responded by publishing his work \\"Libra astron√≥mica y philos√≥phica\\" (1690). Here he rigorously justified his view of comets, referring to the most current scientific knowledge of his time; against the Thomism and Aristotelianism of Father Kino he quoted authors like Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Kepler and Tycho Brahe. Until recently it had been thought that another of his works, \\"Los infortunios de Alonso Ram√≠rez\\" (1690), describing the adventures of a Puerto Rican named Alonso Ram√≠rez, was a mere fiction invented by the famous Mexican intellectual. It has now been shown to be a historical account. [See article on Siguenza y Gongora] Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora. The heavy rains of 1691 flooded the fields and threatened to flood the city; the wheat crop was devastated by a disease. Sig√ºenza used a precursor of the microscope to discover that the cause of this disease in wheat was the Chiahuiztli, an insect like the flea. As a result of this disaster, the following year there was a severe shortage of food which caused large-scale rioting. Mobs looted Spaniards' shops and caused numerous fires in government buildings. Sig√ºenza managed to salvage the city library from the fire, avoiding a great loss. Sig√ºenza estimated that about ten thousand people took part in the riot. As the royal cosmographer of New Spain he drew hydrologic maps of the Valley of Mexico. In 1693 he was sent by the viceroy as a companion of Andr√©s de Pez in an exploration trip to the north of the Gulf of Mexico and in particular the peninsula of Florida, where he drew maps of Pensacola Bay and the mouth of the Mississippi River. This experience may have inspired him to write about marine adventure in the \\"Misfortunes of Alonso Ramirez\\". In his later years he spent much time collecting material for a history of ancient Mexico. Unfortunately, his untimely death interrupted the work, which was not resumed until centuries later when criolla self-awareness had developed enough to be interested in the identity of their nation. Sig√ºenza had directed that upon his death, his valuable library with more than 518 books would be donated to a Jesuit school, and his body handed over to medical research in order to find a cure for the disease that caused his death. =Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz= Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, Baroque music composer, philosopher and poet, portrait by Miguel Cabrera. Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz (1651 - 1695), known as the \\"Tenth Muse\\", was born on 12 November 1651 in San Miguel Nepantla and died in Mexico City on April 17, 1695. She was one of the greatest writers during the Golden Age. Her passion for literature began in childhood, but as a woman, she could not get into university, so she started to write poetry, pieces of music, sonnets, ten-line stanzas and books. She first entered the Carmelite order, but decided to change to the Jer√≥nimas in the Convento de San Jer√≥nimo (Mexico City), which is now University of the Cloister of Sor Juana. Her works included \\"Redondillas\\" and \\"Al que ingrato me deja\\" (To the one who ungratefully leaves me). She composed a poem which became a Christmas carol called \\"¬°Ah de las mazmorras!\\" (Ah dungeons!). She was on the verge of condemnation by the Spanish Inquisition, because at that time women were not thought fit to philosophize. There was presumed to be a lesbian relationship between Sor Juana and Viceroy Mar√≠a Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga yet there was no certain evidence. It was also alleged that she was a feminist, citing her accusations against men and her poems such as those mentioned above. Sor Juana eventually retired from writing and poetry to devote herself to religious work. She became characterized by a famous phrase: \\"I, the worst of all.\\" In 1695, an epidemic of plague affected the capital of New Spain, including the Convento de San Jer√≥nimo. Sor Juana helped care for the sick until she contracted the plague and died.

The Pantheon of Asturian Kings is a chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto in the Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo, Spain. It is the burial place of many of the rulers of the medieval kingdoms of Asturias and Le√≥n. The name Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto (\\"Our Lady of the Chaste King\\") alludes to Alfonso II of Asturias, known as \\"the Chaste\\", considered the founder of the cathedral. The original royal pantheon was located in the 9th-century Church of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto on the same site. On the initiative of Tom√°s Reluz, Bishop of Oviedo, that pantheon and the church were demolished in the early 18th century due to their poor state of conservation. Both were rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1712.  The primitive Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo  In the 9th century Alfonso II of Asturias, king of Asturias, ordered the erection of a church of Our Lady in his new capital of Oviedo, with the intention of establishing a royal pantheon as a final resting place for himself and his wife, queen Berta. This church later became known in his honor as the Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto (\\"Church of Our Lady of the Chaste King\\"). The primitive Pantheon of Kings was located in the narthex of the church. Rather than the church being entered through the narthex as is customary, the main entrance was through a doorway in the southern arm of the church, with the narthex being dedicated entirely as a place of entombment for Asturian monarchs. A statue by V√≠ctor Hevia Granda on the portico of the cathedral, representing Alfonso II. The primitive pantheon was a small oblong room wide (the same width as the principal nave of the church), deep, and somewhere between and in height. The ceiling was of wood, and over the pantheon was the upper choir of the church, which, as in the churches of San Miguel de Lillo and San Salvador de Valdedi√≥s, was located in the narthex. On either side of the royal pantheon were small closet-like rooms, one of which contained the staircase to the choir upstairs. The other small room may have been for storage of items used during religious services. The pantheon was connected to the main sanctuary of the church through a wide door near the main altar of the church; a small window also connected the pantheon to the sanctuary. Both, according to the chroniclers of the time, were closed with heavy iron bars that nearly prevented any sunlight from entering the pantheon. Fortunato de Selgas, La primitiva bas√≠lica de Santa Mar√≠a del rey Casto de Oviedo y su real pante√≥n, 20 May 1887. Accessed online on cervantesvirtual.com. Humble in appearance, the royal pantheon received the bodies of numerous members of the Asturian- Leonese royal family over the course of several centuries. According to the chroniclers of the period, the tombs were quite close together, to the point where it was not possible to walk between them; for lack of space, some members of the royal family were entombed elsewhere in the church. Not all of the bodies were entombed in the walls or in freestanding tombs; some were buried in the floor, their graves covered by unadorned slabs of stone, in most cases without inscriptions. Near the staircase connecting the church to the upper choir was a tomb that was much venerated in the 16th century, owing to the widespread belief that saints were buried there. Nonetheless, chronicler Ambrosio de Morales believed that by that time the bodies that had been buried there had been removed to another place. The tomb was covered with a marble slab. A worn and nearly illegible Latin inscription read \\"Adepti...Regna Celestia potiti\\". It is impossible to know exactly what the inscription may have originally said, but Regna Celestia is \\"the Kingdom of Heaven\\" and adepti and potiti both mean \\"obtained\\" or \\"attained\\". In the royal pantheon, near the entrance, some above the floor, was a tomb covered by a roughly worked lid without adornment or inscription. Nonetheless, tradition and the preeminent location of the tomb led to general agreement among historians that it was the tomb of Alfonso II, founder of the church and of the royal pantheon. Several other members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family were entombed elsewhere in the primitive Church of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto, outside the royal pantheon: * Fruela I of Asturias (722-768), king of Asturias. Son of Alfonso I of Asturias \\"the Catholic\\" and queen Ermesinda.Tradition says that in one of the tombs of the church, sheltered by an arch, rested the remains of this king and his wife queen Munia of √Ålava, and that both bodies had been moved here, after having been entombed in the primitive church of San Salvador of Oviedo, on the orders of their son Alfonso II \\"the Chaste\\". * Queen Munia de √Ålava, wife of Fruela I and mother of Alfonso II \\"the Chaste\\". * Queen Elvira Men√©ndez (?-921), wife of Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n and mother of Alfonso IV of Le√≥n and Ramiro II of Le√≥n. * Queen Urraca S√°nchez (?-956), wife of Ramiro II and mother of Sancho I of Le√≥n.Other authors state that the Queen Urraca entombed here is not the wife of Ramiro II but the wife of the infante Ramiro, aspirant to the throne and son of Alfonso III of Asturias \\"the Great\\". * Queen Teresa Ans√∫rez (?-997), wife of Sancho I, and mother of Ramiro III of Le√≥n. = The campaign of Almanzor = At the greatest extent of Muslim power in Iberia, during the military campaign of Almanzor in the year 986 against the kingdom of Le√≥n, king Bermudo II of Le√≥n (\\"the Gouty\\") ordered that royal remains be gathered from Le√≥n, Astorga and other places to the Church of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto to prevent their profanation by the Muslim armies. These remains were placed in seven wooden boxes and brought to the city of Oviedo. There not being sufficient space for them in the royal pantheon, they were placed in the church. The seven boxes contained the remains of the following individuals: Sepulcros de la Casa Real de Castilla, p. 162. # King Alfonso III of Asturias (\\"the Great\\") and his wife Jimena of Asturias. # Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n and his wives Elvira Men√©ndez and Sancha of Pamplona. # Ramiro II of Le√≥n, Sancho I of Le√≥n, Teresa Ans√∫rez, Ordo√±o III of Le√≥n and Queen Elvira. # Fruela II of Le√≥n and his first wife Nunilo Jim√©nez. # Queen Elvira. # Urraca S√°nchez, wife of Ramiro II. # The seventh box contained the remains of various infantes and infantas. After the death of Almanzor, and of his son Abd al-Malik al- Muzaffar, king Alfonso V of Le√≥n repopulated the city of Le√≥n, and moved there the greater part of the remains that his father Bermudo II had brought to Oviedo. Nonetheless the remains of kings Alfonso III and Fruela II and queens Jimena, Munia, Elvira Men√©ndez, Urraca S√°nchez and Teresa Ans√∫rez remained in the royal pantheon in Oviedo.  The new Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo  = History = Toward the end of the 17th century, the pantheon of kings was basically intact but in a poor state of conservation, as was the primitive Church of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto, of which it was part. On May 15, 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a royal decree dedicating all benefices derived from Tanes and Bra√±alonga to the Cathedral of Oviedo with the intent of contributing to the maintenance and restoration of the primitive church. Some years later, in 1705, the council in charge of the cathedral sent a memorial to the king, indicating the continued poor condition of the church and of the royal pantheon; bishop Tom√°s Reluz sent an accompanying letter recommending the demolition of the primitive church. The proposal was accepted. Reluz was the principal instigator of the early 18th century construction of the new chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto. The new pantheon was located between the pillars of the left nave (known in Spanish as the nave del evangelio, \\"the nave of the Gospel\\"), enclosed by an iron grate, with light entering through an oval. This disposition has been interpreted as a loss of importance for the function of the royal pantheon to the church, favoring instead the function of the church as a Marian sanctuary. Nonetheless, the location of the new royal pantheon at the foot of the left nave allowed a wider central nave for the new structure. La construcci√≥n de la Capilla de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto y Pante√≥n Real de la Catedral de Oviedo. Vidal √Ångel de la Madrid √Ålvarez. p. 9 and 14. The contract to construct the new chapel was signed November 10, 1705, by Bishop Reluz and master builder Bernab√© de Hazas. Construction costs were estimated at 24,000 ducats and the time for construction at three years. On August 2, 1709, the dome of the new Chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto, still under construction at that time, collapsed, causing several deaths. The chapel was completed in 1712, although it was not until 1717 that the picture of the Virgin was moved from the Chapel of Santa Barbara in the Cathedral to the new chapel. = Description = The Royal Pantheon occupies the last section of the northern side of the chapel of Nuestra Se√±ora del Rey Casto in the Cathedral of Oviedo. It is the most sumptuous part of the cathedral complex, richly decorated in carvings of plants and heraldic emblems. In six niches, among other funerary urns, are the remains of many members of the Asturian- Leonese royal family. A tablet on the chapel wall gives the names of those entombed there, although it contains some errors. Sepulcros de la Casa Real de Castilla. p. 48-49. The gratings of the royal pantheon and the church were made by Andr√©s Garc√≠a Casielles and were put in place in 1713. The grating that closes off access to the Royal Pantheon is adorned with the coat of arms of king Philip V of Spain; a similar grating, but without the royal seal, adorns the Chapel of the Annunciation of the cathedral. In the center of the Royal Pantheon is a sarcophagus covered by a fifth century marble tombstone. It is the only surviving tomb from the primitive pantheon. Some studies indicate that this sarcophagus was used to transport the remains of the Asturian king Alfonso III (\\"the Great\\") and his wife Queen Jimena from the city of Astorga to Oviedo. The sepulchral urn is of ordinary unadorned stone. The overlying cover is marble, coffin-shaped, wider at the head than the feet, and entirely covered in reliefs. A sculpted epitaph in somewhat obscure Latin appears to state that it contains the body of one Ithacius > INCLVSI TENERVM PRAETIOSO MARMORE CORPVS AETERNAM IN SEDE NOMINIS ITHACII The present-day Royal Pantheon. At least one possible reading of this is: \\"I have enclosed a tender body with precious marble in the eternal resting place of the family of Ithacius,\\" but there are various other possibilities (including \\"‚Ä¶of the fame of Ithacius\\" and \\"‚Ä¶by the name of Ithacius\\"). This tomb was reused in the Royal Pantheon, although the specific identity of the body currently located within it is unclear. Further discussion of the inscription may be found in Emil H√ºbner, Inscriptiones Hispaniae christianae edidit Aemilius H√ºbner (1871, pub. G. Reimerum, in Latin), p. 46 and Fortunato de Selgas Monumentos ovetenses del Siglo IX (1908, pub. San Francisco de Sales, in Spanish), p. 80. The latter records various speculations about the sarcophagus and the identity of its original occupant, including that Ithacius may have been the name of the tomb's sculptor rather than its original occupant. = Kings and queens entombed in the Royal Pantheon = The following members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family are entombed in the baroque urns of the Pantheon, according to various historians: * Fruela I of Asturias (722-768), king of Asturias. Son of Alfonso I of Asturias (\\"the Catholic\\") and queen Ermesinda. * Bermudo I of Asturias (\\"the Deacon\\" ?-797), king of Asturias. Son of Fruela of Cantabria, nephew of Alfonso I of Asturias, and successor to Mauregato of Asturias.According to the chronicler Ambrosio de Morales, Bermudo I was originally entombed in the hermitage of Ciella, together with his queen consort Uzenda Nunilona, and his daughter the infanta Cristina. Their mortal remains were transferred by order of Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile (\\"the Emperor\\", 1105-1157), who ordered them moved to the monastery of San Juan Bautista de Corias. There they were placed in front of the altar of San Mart√≠n, in the interior of three stone arches. (Sepulcros de la Casa Real de Castilla. Chapter X. p. 135.) * Alfonso II of Asturias (\\"the Chaste\\", 759-842), king of Asturias. Son of Fruela I and grandson of Alfonso I. * Ramiro I of Asturias (790-850), king of Asturias. Nephew and successor of Alfonso II and son of Bermudo I. * Ordo√±o I of Asturias (830-866), king of Asturias. Son and successor of Ramiro I. * Alfonso III of Asturias (\\"the Great\\", 848-910), king of Asturias. Son of Ordo√±o I and queen Nu√±a. * Garc√≠a I of Le√≥n (871-914), king of Le√≥n. Son of Alfonso III of Asturias and queen Jimena of Asturias. * Fruela II of Le√≥n (c.875-925), king of Le√≥n. Son of Alfonso III of Asturias and brother of Garc√≠a I of Le√≥n].Nonetheless, other authors say that Fruela II was entombed in the Cathedral of Le√≥n together with his brother, King Ordo√±o II of Le√≥n. If so, it is unknown where in that cathedral his remains would be. El Pante√≥n Real de las Huelgas de Burgos. Los enterramientos de los reyes de Le√≥n y de Castilla. Juan C. Elorza. p. 50. * Queen Munia de √Ålava, wife of Fruela I and mother of Alfonso II. * Queen Berta, wife of Alfonso II. * Queen Nu√±a, wif of Ordo√±o I and mother of Alfonso III. * Queen Jimena of Asturias (?-912), daughter of Garc√≠a √ç√±iguez de Pamplona, wife of Alfonso III, and mother of Garc√≠a I, Ordo√±o II and Fruela II. * Queen Elvira Men√©ndez (?-921), wife of Ordo√±o II and mother of Alfonso IV of Le√≥n and Ramiro II of Le√≥n. * Queen Nunilo Jimena, wife of Fruela II. * Queen Urraca of Pamplona (?-956), wife of King Ramiro II of Le√≥n and mother of King Sancho I of Le√≥n. * Queen Teresa Ans√∫rez (?-997), wife of King Sancho I of Le√≥n and mother of King Ramiro III of Le√≥n.

Red Lopez (1886 ‚Äì October 1921), born Rafael Lopez, was a little-known Mexican outlaw who was responsible for at least thirty known murders in northern Mexico and the American Southwest. He fought in the Mexican Revolution. He was eventually killed in a shootout by American Frank Hamer, a Texas Ranger. Biography =Early life= Rafael \\"Red\\" Lopez was born in northern Mexico about 1886. His mother was an Indian, and his father was Martin Lopez. His father later became a general in Pancho Villa's army. One of Lopez's uncles was Pablo Lopez, another Villista general. He is credited with the Santa Isabel Massacre in 1916. As a youth, Lopez and his younger brother were sent to New Mexico Territory to work in the mines with some of their relatives. In New Mexico, Lopez became a skilled equestrian and marksman. By 1913 he was employed by Buffalo Bill Cody in his Wild West show, which toured both nationally and internationally. =Utah= Bingham, Utah in 1914. On November 21, 1913, Lopez shot and killed a fellow miner named Juan Valdez in Bingham, Utah. According to differing accounts, Lopez and Valdez had argued over a woman. Kerry Boren says that Lopez was exacting revenge for Valdez's alleged murder of the former's brother years before. Lopez had no intention of surrendering to the authorities and fled across snow-covered mountains on foot to a ranch located near Utah Lake and the present-day town of Saratoga Springs. A four-man posse was soon on Lopez's trail, and they caught up with him at about 4:30 p.m. that same day. They rode their horses right into an ambush. As the posse was approaching the ranch house, Lopez opened fire on them from a nearby ditch with a Model 1895 30-06 Winchester rifle. At a distance later determined by the Salt Lake Tribune to be 118 yards, Lopez struck the Bingham police chief, John William Grant, in the back and killed him instantly. Next Lopez hit Deputy Nephi Jensen in the pelvis and Deputy George Witbeck in the right side of his chest. Jensen died almost immediately, but Witbeck survived for about twenty minutes. Deputy Julius Sorenson was saved by a defective bullet. He was the only one of the four lawmen to return Lopez's fire, and the Mexican retreated from the field. News of the shootout quickly spread. Lawmen from all over Utah assembled to participate in what would become the state's largest manhunt in history. The new posse consisted of a total of about 200 men, both civilians and lawmen. Meanwhile, Lopez went to hide in the Minnie Silver Mine outside Bingham. He stopped at the home of a friend, Mike Stefano, and took his Model 1894 30-30 Winchester rifle. A few days later, the police were informed of Lopez's whereabouts and they proceeded to block off the entrances to the mine with armed guards. On November 29, the posse tried to smoke Lopez out by sending two deputies in with an ore car full of hay to start a fire, but Lopez killed them both. The remaining possemen attempted to starve Lopez into submission, but he survived due to the efforts of sympathetic miners, who left food in the tunnels. The posse also tried pumping smoke and fumes into the place, but this did not work, either. Finally, Lopez escaped the mine into Bingham Canyon and got away. The posse called off the search on January 3, 1914, the day after finding the mine empty. Lopez was never again seen in Utah, but his case remained open for ninety years. The shootout on November 21, 1913, was the deadliest in the history of Utah law enforcement. =Texas= Generals Martin Lopez (far right) and Pablo Lopez (left of Villa) standing with Pancho Villa (center) and other Villista commanders in 1914. Lopez fled to Texas, where he became the leader of an outlaw gang. According to Kerry Boren, many of Lopez's men were former members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch. For the next several years, Lopez plundered banks and trains along the Rio Grande. Between 1915 and 1916 he fought in the Mexican Revolution with his father. Somewhere near the international border, Lopez and his men in 1914 derailed a train, robbed it, and killed nineteen of the twenty American passengers on board. In response to the massacre, the Texas Rangers began pursuing Lopez, but they failed to catch up with him for years. Kerry Boren says that Lopez died in 1916 during a battle between American and Villista forces. Other historians have concluded that he was killed by Frank Hamer in 1921. In October 1921, Frank Hamer was in command of Company C, Texas Rangers, with which he had worked on and off for years. He was told by an informant that Lopez was expected to attend an upcoming meeting of outlaws near the Rio Grande. Hamer decided to ambush the meet with some of his men by having them take up positions in an irrigation ditch and fire on the outlaws as they rode across the river border. After they moved into place, Hamer suspected that the informant had led him into a trap, so he had his men hide the horses and reposition themselves on a low ridge thirty yards away, which overlooked the irrigation ditch. As the sun began to set, the rangers spotted about twenty armed men approaching on foot to the rear of the ditch. Hamer later said that at this time, he could see both the informant and Lopez, who was wearing his \\"trademark clothing,\\" a red bandana and overalls. Hamer stood up from his concealed position and shouted \\"Halt! Were officers of the law!\\" in Spanish. Instantly Lopez \\"whirled around'\\" and fired at Hamer with a rifle, grazing him on the cheek. Hamer opened fire with his .35 caliber Remington Model 8. His first bullet struck Lopez in the chest and he died instantly. Hamer aimed for the informant, but, before he could fire, one of the other rangers shot the man down. The fighting lasted about thirty minutes. Eleven bandits were killed that day while none of the rangers was hurt, except Hamer's graze. Hamer took a gold watch off Lopez's body; it was covered in blood and had been damaged by one of the lawman's bullets. Hamer gave the watch to his brother, Harrison, who hung it on a wall in the customs house in Laredo. The watch remained on display for several years afterward. Although Lopez was dead and his gang defeated, the Texas Rangers never told the state of Utah. The Lopez case remained open until January 24, 2003. After years of investigating on his own time and money, Deputy Sheriff Randy Lish of Salt Lake County confirmed that the Lopez of Utah and the Lopez of Texas were the same man, and the case was closed.

He was born to Samuel Eliot, a Boston publisher and bookseller; and Elizabeth Marshall, from the West Indies. Eliot married Elizabeth Barrell of Boston, and married a second time in 1786 to Catherine Atkins, daughter of Dudley and Sarah (n√©e Kent) Atkins of Newburyport, Massachusetts. The second marriage produced six children, one being Samuel Atkins Eliot. He was the grandfather of Samuel Eliot, Charles Eliot Norton and Charles William Eliot. His granddaughter, Mary Elizabeth Bray (1810‚Äì86), was married to Hamburg banker Johann Heinrich Gossler III (1805‚Äì1879), owner of Berenberg Bank and a member of the Berenberg-Gossler banking dynasty.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Koƒçevje municipal site Its territory is now part of the village of Podlesje. Name The name of the village, Verderb, is of German origin but its motivation is uncertain. Explanations connect it with the German noun Verderb 'spoilage, deterioration', perhaps referring to a 'forest completely ruined' (i.e., cleared for settlement) or to the complete removal of vegetation for agriculture. The Gottschee German surname Verderber is derived from Verderb, referring to a resident of (or with ancestry from) that village. History Verderb was a Gottschee German village. In the Koƒçevje land registry of 1574, Verderb was listed as a joint settlement with Verdreng with 11 half-farms together. In 1770 Verderb had 10 houses. Before the Second World War the village had six houses. In May 1942 the first Partisan military school was established in the nearby forest. The village was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive and it was never rebuilt.

It was constructed in 1960 due to a demand by the Strategic Air Command that its bomber bases have a staging area to launch alerts from. History The alert force at Loring was established on October 15, 1957. Three months later, the 42d Bombardment Wing began supporting an alert force with six aircraft, later expanding to the entire wing. During the later half of 1958, the alert force was a member of Operation Head Start, the first test in the United States Air Force of sustained airborne alert operations. At or around this time, it was decided to move the alert force to a dedicated location to the southeast of the runway. From 1960 until 1967, alert forces remained at the new location, until the 1965 submission of Project One Roof was implemented. The submission of this project by base staff consolidated alert functions back under the roof of Building 6000, which had previously hosted the alert forces until the alert area's construction. For the next sixteen years, the alert area would remain vacant until 1983, when a major renovation to the mole hole building allowed for the area to be occupied again. By 1972, the alert force was reduced so that 62% of the bomber and 72% of the tanker force would be on alert. Increased military funding in the early 1980s due to the domestic policies of Ronald Reagan's administration allowed for a wing to be added to the mole hole. This allowed for the building to be reoccupied until the drawdown of forces under the administration of George H. W. Bush in the early 1990s. Buildings The alert area is a forty acre high-security area located to the southeast corner of the runway, and bordered to the east by forest. It also contains a Christmas tree and mole hole, among other buildings. Within the alert area, a 1994 survey identified the following buildings facilities as existing: \\"One Christmas tree apron (Structure No. 540), the Alert Crew Readiness Building (8970), a surveillance and control tower (8990), a Security Police Entry Control Building (8965), an electric power station building (8966), a heating fuel oil storage tank (8967), and tennis courts (14501).

The first livestock included red deer, red fox and badger. Today, the area of the park has been enlarged and contains about 600 animals of 90 species. These include raccoon dogs, wild boar, bears, gray wolves, pot- bellied pigs, waders, Heidschnucken, raccoons, porcupines, mouflon, bison, snowy owls, monkeys and ferrets.

Although it sometimes encompasses the entire unit, today the term is more used for a set group of individuals. History RCAF alert crew at Zweibr√ºcken Air Base, Germany in 1957 waiting to scramble with the Canadair Sabre jet fighters =World War I and World War II= Although alert crews were probably in use during World War I, the term primarily came of use during World War II, as single seat fighter pilots or multi-seat fighter/pursuit aircraft crews would be scrambled to intercept enemy fighter or bomber aircraft, as was most notably characterized by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Battle of Britain in 1940. The concept was later adopted by other services, such as fighter elements (albeit known as \\"pursuit\\" aircraft at the time) of the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF). =Cold War and strategic forces= After World War II ended and the Cold War began, the United States, its NATO and other allies, and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact and other allies would keep a combination of strategic and tactical air and missile forces on alert. With the establishment of the Strategic Air Command (SAC]) and the redesignation of the United States Air Force (USAF), SAC began to include its nuclear strike bomber and aerial refueling aircraft on alert status. At the same time, USAF's Air Defense Command (ADC), later renamed the Aerospace Defense Command (ADC) and later integrated into Tactical Air Command (TAC), would keep dedicated single-seat and multi-seat fighter-interceptor aircraft on 24/7/365 alert, to include those TAC-gained interceptors assigned to the Air National Guard (ANG), to defend US territory and air bases. This would later incorporate fighter aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in defense of the North American continent under the aegis of the joint US-Canadian North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), later renamed the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Other NATO/Allied air forces with a nuclear strike capability, most notably the Royal Air Force (RAF), would also keep bomber and aerial refueling aircraft on alert during the Cold War. Conversely, the principal adversary of the period, the Soviet Union, also kept their manned bomber and strategic missile forces on alert in similar fashion. The United States' experience in maintaining a vast network of alert air crews, and later ICBM crews, represents the penultimate iteration of the alert crew concept. SAC crews on alert duty would typically be on alert for seven days out of a 21-day period, while being on rotational alert duty. During their alert duty, they would fly training missions to help keep their skills sharpened and occupy the time. With the introduction of B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress aircraft, SAC alert crew members would live apart from the main complex of their respective air base, typically in a Readiness Crew Building (RCB) known as a mole hole, adjacent to an Alert Apron / Alert Ramp facility colloquially named a \\"Christmas Tree\\". These facilities functioned as a home away from home for the bomber and aerial refueling aircraft flight crews for the duration of their alert duty. If the klaxon was sounded, alert crews would exit the mole holes and literally run out to their waiting planes, which would be ready at a moment's notice to launch. As SAC introduced strategic intercontinental ballistic missiles into its nuclear strike inventory, these systems were also manned by alert crews, typically pulling one 24-hour alert duty period every 72 hours in hardened underground launch facilities either adjacent to or in the vicinity of their missiles. Augmenting this arrangement was a SAC airborne command post known as Looking Glass. Using modified EC-135 aircraft, Looking Glass functioned as SAC's alternate command post, with one aircraft always airborne 24/7/365 from its inception until the end of the Cold War. As the Cold War ended, the bomber and tanker combinations were taken off of constant alert and the USAF EC-135 aircraft superseded by the U.S. Navy's E-6 Mercury TACAMO aircraft in the Looking Glass role for SAC's post-Cold War successor, the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). In lieu of \\"Christmas Tree\\" facilities, the smaller size of USAF fighter and fighter-interceptor aircraft enabled them to be stationed in individual alert hangars during the Cold War, typically located very close to a runway, but separate from their bomber and tanker counterparts.http://www.f-16.net/forum/download/file.php?id=9037&t;=1https://www.flickr.com/photos/29449330@N00/5170429141 With the end of the Cold War, in addition to the alert posture of their strategic bomber fleets, the United States and other nations drastically scaled back their fighter alert posture, with the United States relegating the mission to a handful of Air National Guard fighter wings. However, following the airliner hijackings and subsequent attacks of September 11, 2001, both the United States and other NATO and Pacific Rim nations upgraded their fighter alert postures markedly. Today, fighter aircraft still are stationed on alert throughout the world, ready to launch at a moment's notice. The USAF's Boeing E-4 fleet, previously operated by SAC and now operated by Air Combat Command (ACC), is also always on constant alert, due to it being designed as a mobile command post for the National Command Authority (namely the President of the United States), the Secretary of Defense, and presidential successors. =Alert crews in naval aviation= In the U.S. Navy, outside of the land- based TACAMO mission, alert crews have historically been organized and managed in a different fashion. During the Cold War, two land-based maritime patrol P-3 Orion aircraft were typically kept on Ready Alert at multiple stateside and forward deployed operating bases. One pre-flighted aircraft and crew was kept ready to launch within one hour of notification and a second within three hours, typically in response to high priority Soviet submarine targets of interest. On deployed aircraft carriers underway, in between routine flight operations in regions where flyovers by potentially hostile aircraft were possible, two to four Navy and/or embarked Marine Corps fighter aircraft would be placed on or in the vicinity of catapults, armed, manned and ready to launch within 5 minutes of notification. This was characterized during the 1960s to present day by F-8 Crusader aircraft, followed by the F-4 Phantom II, the F-14 Tomcat, and today by the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18 Super Hornet. This \\"Ready Five\\" alert was augmented by a Ready 15 alert of pre-flighted, armed, but unmanned aircraft near the catapults with the pilot or crew standing by in the squadron's ready room, ostensibly able to launch within 15 minutes. Alert flight crews for airborne early warning, fixed-wing and rotary-wing antisubmarine warfare, and search and rescue helicopters were similarly established as required, typically in a Ready 15 or Ready 30 mode. This model was employed during the Cold War and continues to be employed to this day, especially when aircraft carriers and their strike groups are operating in areas of increased international tension.

Distinctions are based on wealth, social status, and race (human categorization). Informal networks (roscas) centered on a person in a position of power are one factor in upper-class dominance. Official demographic categories based mainly on housing characteristics shed some light on the socioeconomic makeup of the population. History Since the sixteenth century, Colombian society has been highly stratified, with social classes generally linked to racial or wealth distinctions, and vertical mobility has been limited. The proportion of white ancestry has been an important measure of status for the mixed groups since the colonial era. In the nineteenth century, Colombia's rugged terrain and inadequate transportation system reinforced social and geographic distance, keeping the numerically superior but disunited masses fragmented and powerless. The nascent middle class lacked a collective consciousness, preferring to identify individually with the upper class. Except in certain instances of urban artisans and some Amerindian communities, the elite was the only social group with sufficient cohesion to articulate goals and make them known to the rest of the society. In the twentieth century, the society began to experience change, not so much in values or orientation as in broadening of the economic bases and an expansion of the social classes. Improvements in transportation, communications, and education‚Äîcoupled with industrialization and rapid urban growth‚Äîopened Colombian society somewhat by expanding economic opportunities. These advances, although mixed, have continued during the first decade of the present century.Bushnell, David and Rex A. Hudson. \\"Social Strata Division\\". In Colombia: A Country Study (Rex A. Hudson, ed.), pp. 101-103. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (2010). Throughout Colombia's history, class structure has played a significant role in society. Class has been a dominant factor with regard to economics, politics, and social parameters. The social structures that were put into place during the colonial era left a legacy of hierarchy that continued to shape Colombian society even after the fall of the chattel slavery system in 1851. Because of the social-economic dynamic that has to exist in order for the institution of slavery to flourish, it is a heavy burden to completely modify cultural standards that have been firmly established for many years. There are patterns that develop along with certain behaviors in how those in power interact with those that have little or no control. In Colombia, this means that whites (who have held power since the 16th century) exercised control over the indigenous population as well as those imported from Africa. So when the practice of slavery ended, the attitude of whites was still to maintain control over economics and politics, thereby ensuring that they would remain at the top of the nation's power structure. This is a true of most locations that were heavily impacted by the Atlantic Slave Trade. Determinants of social classes The many terms for color still being used reflect the persistence of this colonial pattern and a continuing desire among Colombians to classify each other according to color and social group. These terms also cut across class lines so that persons at one level define themselves as being racially similar to those at other levels. The confusion over classification has affected most Colombians because most of them do not define themselves as being white, black, or Amerindian, which are distinct and mutually exclusive groups, but as belonging to one of the mixed categories. In addition to racial and wealth factors, Colombia's classes are distinguished by education, family background, lifestyle, occupation, power, and geographic residence. In Colombia, those of European, African, and Native heritage inter-mixed rigidly. This placed more of an emphasis of social class than racial identity, although race does play some what of a factor in Colombian culture. Most of Colombia's population identifies racially as either \\"mestizo\\" (a mix of European and Native heritage) or Afro-Colombian (of African and either European or Native descent). Roughly seventy-five percent of Colombians claim to be of mixed heritage, while whites make up approximately twenty percent, with the rest of the makeup being four percent pure African descent and one percent native. Due to a large proportion of the population who identify as mixed-blood (either mestizo or Afro-Colombian) it is widely accepted that race is not an issue in Colombia. This was by design, as the Colombian government sought to phase out racial dimensions with the use of mestizaje; this was a purposeful intermixing of Africans and Natives with white Spaniards in efforts at creating a new race.Urrutia, p. 258. This was not completely effective, as division among Colombia's elite, middle, and lower class is directly related to racial concepts. In effect, darker skin (Afro and Native) is associated with lower social status; moving up the status chain means that \\"whiteness\\" becomes more pronounced.Dix, p. 37. While this is not the dynamic faced in a place like the U.S., where any African blood immediately placed one at the bottom of the social and economic food-chain, racial division is still a part of everyday life in Colombia. The difference with Colombia is that there were never any systematic legal designations put in place in order to divide society along racial lines like the Jim Crow system of the U.S. In Colombia, the division is ingrained in the culture, especially with regard to economic opportunity and education. \\"Whiteness\\" in Colombia has been the goal of society since the mid-19th century, when trends towards identifying with European culture instead of indigenous or mestizo became popular. This included encouraging those of indigenous or mestizo blood to aspire to climb up the social ladder by becoming more European in dress, occupation, and manners. In essence, the more that those of color sought to align themselves with white or European culture, the more opportunities to advance both economically and socially were given. Within every class, there are numerous subtle gradations in status. Colombians tend to be extremely status-conscious, and class identity is an important aspect of social life because it regulates the interaction of groups and individuals. Social-class boundaries are far more flexible in the city than in the countryside, but consciousness of status and class distinctions continues to permeate social life throughout Colombia. The role of women in Colombia has also been a source of complexity in Colombian society. Because women are seen as being beneath men in most regards, women have had to struggle to assume a role in Colombian society other than being bearers of children. Because most of Latin America is seen as a machismo society, where men wield power and women are subordinates, women have been in a position of having to assert themselves in order to gain basic rights and to become individuals instead of just a trophy of men. During the 19th century when ideas from the Liberalism ideology swept Latin America, the role of women began to be discussed as a means of understanding how women could be valuable members of society rather than brainless puppets. Because Liberalism stresses individual freedoms, equality, and individualism, when it became the backbone of revolution it could not be placed in a position to be used by Latin American men only; women wanted to enjoy the benefits of liberalism as well.Stanfield, p. 36. Conservative factions regained control of Colombian politics in 1885, effectively erasing some of the gains that women had made socially (such as the right to divorce). This caused women to be placed back into traditional roles as private and invisible members of society once again, limiting the growth of women's rights and returning them to pre-Revolution gender roles whereby men had absolute control.Stanfield, p. 36. A proper education for women was one that reinforced traditional roles for women of being a homemaker and mother. In this regard, education was not used a vehicle to uplift women and help them to gain power in society structures, but instead to emphasize that women were to be a support mechanism for males and nothing more. This attitude towards the advancement of women was intended to keep women in a box rather than to see them becomes leaders outside the home, whereby they would be taking over power from males in authority positions.Stanfield, p. 46. Class characteristics The upper class is very successful in maintaining exclusivity and controlling change through a system of informal decision-making groups called roscas‚Äîthe name of a twisted pastry. Such groups exist at different levels and across different spheres and are linked hierarchically by personal relationships. Their composition varies according to level--municipal, departmental, or national--but each group tries to include at least one powerful person from every sphere. A rosca is a vitally important system in both the social and the political context because it is at this level of interaction that most political decisions are made and careers determined. Only as a member of such a group can an individual be considered a member of the upper-middle or upper class. Indeed, the listed names of past presidents reflect how power has remained the purview of a small number of elite families instead of a meritocracy. Colombia has an abundance of families that belonged to the middle-class sector of society and are struggling between the need to survive and the desire to give their children a good education. The lower-middle class, constituting the bulk of the middle class, comes primarily from upwardly mobile members of the lower class. A large number are clerks or small shopkeepers. Many have only a precarious hold on middle-class status and tend to be less concerned with imitating upper- class culture and behavior than with making enough money to sustain a middle- class lifestyle. Such families tend to be just as concerned as those at higher social levels with giving their children an education. Many hope to send at least one of their children through a university, regardless of the financial burden. Official strata divisions The official strata division provides another look at social classes. A 1994 law provides \\"an instrument that allows a municipality or district to classify its population in distinct groups or strata with similar social and economic characteristics\\". The law was framed this way to establish cross-class subsidies that would help those in the lower strata pay for utilities. Housing characteristics, such as a garage, a front yard, and quality of the neighborhood, are the main criteria used. Depending on the diversity and quality of housing, there could be six strata: level one is lower-low, two is low, three is upper-low, four is medium, five is medium- high, and six is high. Most cities have all six, but there are towns that have only three. This national classification identifies groups with similar socioeconomic characteristics. Although strata are not a direct reflection of social class, they provide useful information beyond income measures. The great majority of the population (89 percent) lives in strata one, two, and three, and on that basis, even if not by other criteria, is considered poor. Strata four, five, and six house only 6.5 percent, 1.9 percent, and 1.5 percent of the population, respectively. In other words, only about 10 percent of the population lives in dwellings that are well built and located in well- developed neighborhoods with access to good utility services. The overlap between these official strata and social class is not perfect. It is possible to find very high-income people living in stratum three and some stratum-six residents who have strong affinity with the lower classes. There are several reasons for these coexisting disparities, the main one being perhaps the strong upward mobility allowed by the illegal-drug industry wealth that did not necessarily lead to a change in self-perception. The living expenses of this group of drug traffickers are very high, but they retain some of the cultural identity, education, and self-perceptions of the lower classes.

A single bolt of lightning carries a relatively large amount of energy (approximately 5 gigajoules or about the energy stored in 38 gallons of gasoline). However, this energy is concentrated in a small location and is passed during an extremely short period of time (microseconds); therefore, extremely high electrical power is involved.\\"The Electrification of Thunderstorms,\\" Earle R. Williams, Scientific American, November 1988, pp. 88‚Äì99 5 gigajoules over 10 microseconds is equal to 500 terawatts. Because lightning bolts vary in voltage and current, a more average calculation would be 10 gigawatts. It has been proposed that the energy contained in lightning be used to generate hydrogen from water, to harness the energy from rapid heating of water due to lightning, or to use a group of lightning arresters to harness a strike, either directly or by converting it to heat or mechanical energy, or to use inductors spaced far enough away so that a safe fraction of the energy might be captured. Overview A technology capable of harvesting lightning energy would need to be able to rapidly capture the high power involved in a lightning bolt. Several schemes have been proposed, but the ever-changing energy involved in each lightning bolt renders lightning power harvesting from ground-based rods impractical ‚Äì too high, it will damage the storage, too low and it may not work. Additionally, lightning is sporadic, and therefore energy would have to be collected and stored; it is difficult to convert high-voltage electrical power to the lower-voltage power that can be stored. In the summer of 2007, an alternative energy company called Alternate Energy Holdings, Inc. (AEHI) tested a method for capturing the energy in lightning bolts. The design for the system had been purchased from an Illinois inventor named Steve LeRoy, who had reportedly been able to power a 60-watt light bulb for 20 minutes using the energy captured from a small flash of artificial lightning. The method involved a tower, a means of shunting off a large portion of the incoming energy, and a capacitor to store the rest. According to Donald Gillispie, CEO of AEHI, they \\"couldn't make it work,\\" although \\"given enough time and money, you could probably scale this thing up... it's not black magic; it's truly math and science, and it could happen.\\" According to Martin A. Uman, co- director of the Lightning Research Laboratory at the University of Florida and a leading authority on lightning,Uman Receives 2001 Fleming Medal. www.agu.org a single lightning strike, while fast and bright, contains very little energy, and dozens of lightning towers like those used in the system tested by AEHI would be needed to operate five 100-watt light bulbs for the course of a year. When interviewed by The New York Times, he stated that the energy in a thunderstorm is comparable to that of an atomic bomb, but trying to harvest the energy of lightning from the ground is \\"hopeless\\". Another major challenge when attempting to harvest energy from lightning is the impossibility of predicting when and where thunderstorms will occur. Even during a storm, it is very difficult to tell where exactly lightning will strike.  Directed plasma channels  To facilitate the harvesting of lightning, a laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) could theoretically be used to allow lightning to strike in a predictable location. A high power laser could be used to form an ionized column of gas, which would act as an atmospheric conduit for electrical discharges of lightning, which would direct the lightning to a ground station for harvesting.Discovery News Lighting Control https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBzxn2LEJoE Teramobile,http://www.teramobile.org/teramobile.html an international project initiated jointly by a French-German collaboration of CNRS (France) and DFG (Germany), has managed to trigger electric activity in thunderclouds by ultrashort lasers. A large amount of power is necessary, 5 terawatts, over the short pulse duration. For the moment, the application of laser-channeled lightning is to use energy to divert the lightning and prevent damage instead of harvesting the lightning energy.

Biography Ignatov was born in the village Tishanskaya of Donskaya Oblast (now Volgograd Oblast) in a family of a Russian carpenter. Since 1915 he started working as a carpenter too. In 1917, after the October Revolution, he joined the Red Army, first as a soldier and then, through the 1920s, as an intelligence officer, operating in Donskaya Oblast and later in Middle Asia. After completing his secondary education in 1932-1934, he worked as a Communist Party representative at a factory in St. Petersburg. In 1938 he became the first Secretary of the Communist Party of Kuybyshev. He was demoted in 1940 for ordering to return one third of the collected crops to farmers, in order to motivate them in the collective agriculture. During World War II he was one of the leaders of the partisan movement in Oryol Oblast, where he was the first Secretary of the Communist Party between 1943 and 1949. During 1949-1952 he took the equivalent party position in Krasnodarsky Krai. In October 1952, Ignatov became a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but after the death of Stalin in 1953 he was demoted and moved first to St. Petersburg, then to Voronezh, and later to Nizhny Novgorod. On 6 May 1957, the central Communist newspaper Pravda published an article where he proposed to reorganize the Soviet economy and generally supported the similar ideas of Nikita Khrushchev. During the next month, he was one of the most active defenders of Khrushchev during the well-organized attempt by Malenkov, Molotov and Kaganovich to demote him within the party. Khrushchev repaid for this by promoting Ignatov to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, as early as in December 1957, bypassing the usually required candidate stage. Since 1957, Ignatov fervently tried to move up in the party system, exploiting the support of Khrushchev, but met a strong opposition of the rivals, such as Alexei Kirichenko and Frol Kozlov. Later, in the 1960s, when the popularity of Khrushchev started to decline, he switched the sides and started traveling around the Soviet Union and personally persuading local party leaders against Khrushchev. He hoped in this way to gain support of the incoming party leader, Leonid Brezhnev, but failed. In 1966, while visiting Chile, he fell ill with an unknown viral infection and died shortly afterwards. Ignatov was awarded with the honorary title Hero of Socialist Labour, as well as with the Order of Lenin (three times), Order of the Red Banner of Labour and Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree. In recognition of his achievements before the Communist Party, he was buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in the Red Square.

Deities One of the most classic portrayals of this is of the Greek god Zeus. An ancient story recounts when Zeus was at war against Cronus and the Titans, he released his brothers, Hades and Poseidon, along with the Cyclopes. In turn, the Cyclopes gave Zeus the thunderbolt as a weapon. The thunderbolt became a popular symbol of Zeus and continues to be today. In Slavic mythology the highest god of the pantheon is Perun, the god of thunder and lightning. Pƒìrkons/Perk≈´nas is the common Baltic god of thunder, one of the most important deities in the Baltic pantheon. In both Latvian and Lithuanian mythology, he is documented as the god of thunder, rain, mountains, oak trees and the sky. In Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder and the sound of thunder comes from the chariot he rides across the sky. The lightning comes from his hammer Mj√∂lnir. In Finnish mythology, Ukko (engl. Old Man) is the god of thunder, sky and weather. The Finnish word for thunder is ukkonen, derived from the god's name. In Judaism, a blessing \\"...He who does acts of creation\\" is to be recited, upon sighting lightning. The Talmud refers to the Hebrew word for the sky, (\\"Shamaim\\") ‚Äì as built from fire and water (\\"Esh Umaim\\"), since the sky is the source of the inexplicable mixture of \\"fire\\" and water that come together, during rainstorms. This is mentioned in various prayersi.e. In the prayer for rain, The angel that fought Jacob was a rainstorm \\"minister angel, mixed of fire and water\\". Other examples: Extra recitings for 2nd day of Passover, and many more. See for example Hebrew book Shekel Aish discussing lightning., Psalm 29, and discussed in writings of Kabbalah. In Islam, the Quran states: \\"He it is Who showeth you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and raiseth the heavy clouds. The thunder hymneth His praise and (so do) the angels for awe of Him. He launcheth the thunder-bolts and smiteth with them whom He will.\\" (Qur'an 13:12‚Äì13) and, \\"Have you not seen how God makes the clouds move gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a stack, and then you see the rain come out of it...\\" (Quran, 24:43). The preceding verse, after mentioning clouds and rain, speaks about hail and lightning, \\"...And He sends down hail from mountains (clouds) in the sky, and He strikes with it whomever He wills, and turns it from whomever He wills.\\" In India, the Hindu god Indra is considered the god of rains and lightning and the king of the Devas. In Japan, the Shinto god Raijin is considered the god of lightning and thunder. He is depicted as a demon who strikes a drum to create lightning. In the traditional religion of the African Bantu tribes, such as the Baganda and Banyoro of Uganda, lightning is a sign of the ire of the gods. The Baganda specifically attribute the lightning phenomenon to the god Kiwanuka, one of the main trio in the Lubaale gods of the sea or lake. Kiwanuka starts wild fires, strikes trees and other high buildings, and a number of shrines are established in the hills, mountains and plains to stay in his favor. Lightning is also known to be invoked upon one's enemies by uttering certain chants, prayers, and making sacrifices.  Ceraunoscopy  Ceraunoscopy is divination by observing lightning or by listening to thunder. It is a type of aeromancy.

Bunce and James A. Deddens, is a certain type of AT algebra, a direct limit of matrix algebras over the continuous functions on the circle, in which the connecting maps are given by embeddings between families of shift operators with periodic weights. Each inductive system defining a Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebra is associated with a supernatural number, which is a complete invariant for these algebras. In the language of K-theory, the supernatural number correspond to the K0 group of the algebra. Also, Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras can be expressed as the C*-crossed product of the Cantor set with a certain natural minimal action known as an odometer action. They also admit a unique tracial state. Together with the fact that they are AT, this implies they have real rank zero. In a broader context of the classification program for simple separable nuclear C*-algebras, AT-algebras of real rank zero were shown to be completely classified by their K-theory, the Choquet simplex of tracial states, and the natural pairing between K0 and traces. The classification of Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras is thus a precursor to the general result. It is also known that, in general, crossed products arising from minimal homeomorphism on the Cantor set are simple AT-algebras of real rank zero.  Definition and basic properties  = Definition = Let C( T ) denote continuous functions on the circle and Mr(C(T)) be the C*-algebra of r √ó r matrices with entries in C(T). For a supernatural number {nk}, the corresponding Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebra B({nk}) is the direct limit: : B(\\\\\\\\{n_k\\\\\\\\}) = \\\\varinjlim \\\\cdots \\\\rightarrow M_{n_k}(C( \\\\mathbb{T} )) \\\\; \\\\stackrel{\\\\beta_k}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\; M_{n_{k+1}}( C(\\\\mathbb{T} ) ) \\\\rightarrow \\\\cdots . One needs to define the embeddings :\\\\beta_k : M_{n_k}(C( \\\\mathbb{T} )) \\\\; \\\\rightarrow \\\\; M_{n_{k+1}}(C( \\\\mathbb{T} )). These imbedding maps arise from the natural embeddings between C*-algebras generated by shifts with periodic weights. For integers n and m, we define an embedding Œ≤ : Mn(C(T)) -> Mnm(C(T)) as follows. On a separable Hilbert space H, consider the C*-algebra W(n) generated by weighted shifts of fixed period n with respect to a fixed basis. W(n) embeds into W(nm) in the obvious way; any n-periodic weighted shift is also a nm-periodic weighted shift. W(n) is isomorphic to Mn(C*(Tz)), where C*(Tz) denotes the Toeplitz algebra. Therefore, W contains the compact operators as an ideal, and modulo this ideal it is Mn(C(T)). Because the map from W(n) into W(nm) preserves the compact operators, it descends into an embedding Œ≤ : Mn(C(T)) -> Mnm(C(T)). It is this embedding that is used in the definition of Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras. = The connecting maps = The Œ≤k's can be computed more explicitly and we now sketch this computation. This will be useful in obtaining an alternative characterization description of the Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras, and also the classification of these algebras. The C*-algebra W(n) is in fact singly generated. A particular generator of W(n) is the weighted shift T of period n with periodic weights ¬Ω, ‚Ä¶, ¬Ω, 1, ¬Ω, ‚Ä¶, ¬Ω, 1, ‚Ä¶. In the appropriate basis of H, T is represented by the n √ó n operator matrix :T = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\; & \\\\cdots & T_z  \\\\frac{1}{2}I & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\;  \\\\; & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  \\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\frac{1}{2}I & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, where Tz is the unilateral shift. A direct calculation using functional calculus shows that the C*-algebra generated by T is Mn(C*(Tz)), where C*(Tz) denotes the Toeplitz algebra, the C*-algebra generated by the unilateral shift. Since it is clear that Mn(C*(Tz)) contains W(n), this shows W(n) = Mn(C*(Tz)). From the Toeplitz short exact sequence, :0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{K} \\\\; {\\\\rightarrow} \\\\; C^*(T_z) \\\\; {\\\\rightarrow} \\\\; C( \\\\mathbb{T} ) \\\\rightarrow 0, one has, :0 \\\\rightarrow M_n(\\\\mathcal{K}) \\\\; \\\\stackrel{i}{\\\\hookrightarrow} \\\\; M_n(C^*(T_z)) \\\\; \\\\stackrel{j}{\\\\rightarrow} \\\\; M_n(C( \\\\mathbb{T} )) \\\\rightarrow 0, where i is the entrywise embedding map and j the entrywise quotient map on the Toeplitz algebra. So the C*-algebra M nk (C (T)) is singly generated by :\\\\tilde{T} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\; & \\\\cdots & z  \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\;  \\\\; & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  \\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}, where the scalar entries denote constant functions on the circle and z is the identity function. For integers nk and nk + 1, where nk divides nk + 1, the natural embedding of W(nk) into W(nk + 1) descends into an (unital) embedding from Mnk(C(T)) into M nk + 1(C(T)). This is the connecting map Œ≤k from the definition of the Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebra that we need to analyze. For simplicity, assume nk = n and nk + 1 = 2nk. The image of the above operator T ‚àà W(n) under the natural embedding is the following 2n √ó 2n operator matrix in W(2n): :T \\\\mapsto \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\; & & & & \\\\; & & T_z  \\\\frac{1}{2}I & \\\\ddots & & & & & & 0  \\\\; & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & & & & & \\\\vdots  \\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\frac{1}{2}I & 0 & & \\\\; & &  & \\\\; & & I & 0 & & &  & & & \\\\; &\\\\frac{1}{2}I& \\\\ddots & & \\\\;  \\\\; & & & &\\\\; & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  \\\\; & \\\\; & & &\\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\frac{1}{2}I & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} . Therefore, the action of the Œ≤k on the generator is : \\\\beta_k (\\\\tilde{T}) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\; & & & & \\\\; & & z  \\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\ddots & & & & & & 0  \\\\; & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & & & & & \\\\vdots  \\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\frac{1}{2} & 0 & & \\\\; & &  & \\\\; & & 1 & 0 & & &  & & & \\\\; &\\\\frac{1}{2} & \\\\ddots & & \\\\;  \\\\; & & & &\\\\; & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  \\\\; & \\\\; & & &\\\\; & \\\\; & \\\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} . A computation with matrix units yields that :\\\\beta_k (E_{ij}) = E_{ij} \\\\otimes I_2 and :\\\\beta_k(z E_{11}) = E_{11} \\\\otimes \\\\Zeta_2, where :\\\\Zeta_2 = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & z  1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\in M_2(C( \\\\mathbb{T})). So :\\\\beta_k( f_{ij}(z) ) = f_{ij}(\\\\Zeta_2).\\\\; In this particular instance, Œ≤k is called a twice-around embedding. The reason for the terminology is as follows: as z varies on the circle, the eigenvalues of Z2 traces out the two disjoint arcs connecting 1 and -1. An explicit computation of eigenvectors shows that the circle of unitaries implementing the diagonalization of Z2 in fact connect the beginning and end points of each arc. So in this sense the circle gets wrap around twice by Z2. In general, when nk + 1 = m*nk, one has a similar m-times around embedding.  K-theory and classification  Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras are classified by their K0 groups. Because all finite-dimensional vector bundles over the circle are homotopically trivial, the K0 of Mr(C(T)), as an ordered abelian group, is the integers Z with canonical ordered unit r. According to the above calculation of the connecting maps, given a supernatural number {nk}, the K0 of the corresponding Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebra is precisely the corresponding dense subgroup of the rationals Q. As it follows from the definition that two Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras with the same supernatural number, in the sense that the two supernatural numbers formally divide each other, are isomorphic, K0 is a complete invariant of these algebras. It also follows from the previous section that the K1 group of any Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebra is Z.  As a crossed product  = C*-crossed product = A C*-dynamical system is a triple (A, G, œÉ), where A is a C*-algebra, G a group, and œÉ an action of G on A via C*-automorphisms. A covariant representation of (A, G, œÉ) is a representation œÄ of A, and a unitary representation t \\\\mapsto Ut of G, on the same Hilbert space, such that :U_t \\\\pi(a) U_t^* = \\\\pi(\\\\sigma(t)(a)), for all a, t. Assume now A is unital and G is discrete. The (C*-)crossed product given by (A, G, œÉ), denoted by :A \\\\rtimes_{\\\\sigma} G, is defined to be the C*-algebra with the following universal property: for any covariant representation (œÄ, U), the C*-algebra generated by its image is a quotient of :A \\\\rtimes_{\\\\sigma} G. = Odometer action on Cantor set = The Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebras in fact are crossed products of the Cantor sets with a natural action by the integers Z. Consider, for example, the Bunce‚ÄìDeddens algebra of type 2‚àû. Write the Cantor set X as sequences of 0's and 1's, :X = \\\\prod \\\\\\\\{ 0,1 \\\\\\\\} , with the product topology. Define a homeomorphism :\\\\alpha: X \\\\rightarrow X by :\\\\alpha (x) = x + (\\\\cdots, 0, 0, 1) where + denotes addition with carryover. This is called the odometer action.

Systad Jacobsen is a screenwriter and director. She has studied film directing at The National Film School of the Czech Republic, as well as Social Anthropology and Theatre Studies at Oslo University. Systad Jacobsen has also studied at London international Film School.  Career  Systad Jacobsen has directed many documentaries. Systad Jacobsen has said that she thoroughly plans and write scripts for her documentaries, influenced by her study of fiction film. She has recently turned to features in order to control more of the process, but still keep the sensitivity of working with real people. Turn Me On, Dammit! was Jacobsen's first fiction feature film. It had its world premiere in 2011 at New York‚Äôs Tribeca Film Festival, where it won an award for Best Screenplay. Jacobsen wrote the screenplay, based on a book by Olaug Nilssen. Systad Jacobsen chose to cast teenagers who had grown up in a small city in the movie, instead of city kids. These teenagers were not actors. Marianne Bakke, the cinematographer of the movie, was previously a still photographer. Turn me on, dammit! introduces Alma, a teenage girl growing up in a small town in Norway, living with her mom, by a shot of her lying on the kitchen floor. Next to her on the kitchen floor lies a telephone from which the voice of a phone-sex operator comes. Alma talks with the voice while masturbating. Alma has a rich imagination, and the person taking up the biggest part of that imagination is Artur, her classmate and neighbor. At a party, Artur finally approaches her with what seems to be sexual intentions and Alma tells her friends about it, but they don‚Äôt believe her. Her peers, including her closest friends, refuse to talk to her and leave her out in the cold. The rumor spreads fast, and soon everyone has a mean nickname for her. While on the bus, passing the sign with the name of her hometown, Alma and her friend used to raise their middle-finger to it, to show their dislike. Alma is now left alone with her dislike of her hometown. The movie portrays young female sexuality with humor and with playfulness. The Clown Children (Klovnebarna) is a documentary about two young boys who make money by dressing up as clowns and showing tricks for people in the cars at a crossing in Guatemala City.

It was released on August 22, 2012. Background On August 6, 2012, the title track of the album was revealed.http://www.mydaily.co.kr/news/read.html?newsid=201208080714561131&ext;=na The song was apparently leaked at KBS' radio show, 2FM Super Junior's \\"Kiss the Radio\\" on August 17. Following the leak, the group's representatives and the staff working for the show apologized on Twitter and posted a message on the radio community board. On August 7, 2012, the title was revealed by Kara's agency and explained its origin from Greek mythology. The concept of the album was to show the group's matured charms through a modern interpretation of Pandora's Box. Steward Ho for M.net noted that the group were about to \\"ditch their younger image and look more like empowered women\\". Member Nicole Jung stated during the album's show case that the group aimed to display their \\"maturing feminism\\". Composition The EP contains four songs plus an instrumental version of the title track. The group worked with Han Jae-ho and Kim Seung-soo along with Sweetune, who produced most of the group's past material. The title track, \\"Pandora\\", is a synthpop dance track. Promotion The group held a showcase to promote the release of the Pandora EP at the Seoul Walkerhill Hotel on August 22. The event was streamed live at M.net Global's website. The group's agency also stated that the members are devoting themselves towards the promotion of the album in South Korea. The group began their weekly promotions for the album starting on KBS' Music Bank where they performed some of the album's songs including \\"Pandora\\" and \\"Miss U\\". A promotional truck that was entirely covered with the album's jacket cover traveled through various parts of Seoul, including Gangnam, Hongdae, Itaewon and Myeongdong. Critical reception Enewsworld editor Erika Kim stated that the group had improved in their vocals. She complimented the member's role within the song and noted some influences from Japanese pop music such as the opening theme songs of magical-girl anime series like Sailor Moon. Throughout the day of release, the members of the group also become the most searched terms on several popular Korean search engines which includes Naver and Daum. Following the music video's release, some concerns were raised regarding the group's suggestive choreography, a dance move where the members remove their jackets to reveal their backs. A representative for KBS's Music Bank stated that the group may need to make changes. However no changes were made when the group made their first televised performance on August 24 at the music program to start their weekly album promotion cycle. Chart performance In South Korea, the EP peaked at number 1 in Gaon Album Chart, and the title track peaked at number 2 in Gaon Digital Chart. The other three songs from the EP, \\"Way\\", \\"Miss U\\", and \\"Idiot\\" also placed on the Gaon Digital Chart. In Japan, the EP debuted at number 104 in Oricon Albums Chart through importation from South Korea. After the Japanese edition was released, the EP peaked number 15 on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart.

The city of Anadan is built on a hill surrounded by a plain. Anadan currently has about thirteen mosques and several elementary schools, a junior high school and a high school for boys and girls. During the Ayyubid period, in the 1220s, Anadan was visited by Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi who noted it was \\"a village near Kinnasrin, in the Kurah district of Urtik, of the Awasim Province.\\" The 13th-century Marasid listed it as a village northeast of Aleppo.le Strange, 1890, p. 394. Syrian Civil War The Battle of Anadan occurred in Anadan from July 29‚Äì30, 2012, during the Syrian civil war. It has been the site of heavy shelling by the Syrian military during the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's government. Consequently, approximately 30,000 people‚Äîmost of Anadan's population‚Äîhave fled according to opposition sources. As a result, Anadan has been described as a \\"ghost town\\" by journalist Suleiman al-Khalidi of Reuters.

It was located near Playa Azul, Michoac√°n, Mexico. The magnitude of the earthquake was 7.2, or 7.3. Three deaths were reported, two from Michoac√°n and one from Mexico City. Some buildings were damaged in both Michoac√°n and Mexico City. A small tsunami was registered in Acapulco with a maximum height of 9 cm. Tectonic setting The southwestern coast of Mexico lies above the convergent boundary where the Rivera Plate and Cocos Plate are being subducted beneath the North American Plate along the Middle America Trench. The area is seismically very active with large thrust type earthquakes occurring along the plate interface and normal fault type earthquakes occurring at a somewhat deeper level within the descending slab. The plate interface seismicity in this area is strongly segmented, with separate Jalisco, Michoac√°n, Guerrero and Colima segments being recognised. The southeastern end of the Michoacan segment coincides with the broad Orozco fracture zone within the Cocos Plate. During the 1970s, with no major earthquakes recorded since at least 1911, the segment was recognised as a major seismic gap. Earthquake This earthquake was an interplate earthquake that occurred in the central part of the Michoac√°n seismic gap. The 1985 Michoac√°n earthquake broke the two remaining parts of the Michoac√°n gap, i.e. those to the north and south of the 1981 Playa Azul earthquake rupture zone. The 1981 Playa Azul earthquake had a focal mechanism of reverse faulting from a shallow-dipping thrust fault. The maximum slip of this earthquake was estimated to be about 4.04 m. According to the calculation of C. Mendoza, along the dipping interface the area of maximum slip was concentrated below the hypocenter, and there was another area of significant slip, of about , above the hypocenter. Damage Michoacan suffered widespread damage with some buildings also affected in Mexico City. There were 2 deaths and 17 people injured in Michoac√°n and 1 death and 11 people injured in Mexico City. One source reports a total of 9 deaths associated with this earthquake. Power outages and telephone service interruptions were widespread in Mexico City.

The school started as a four-year Secondary school and was extended in 1966 prior to amalgamation with the old East Kilbride Village school to form a full six- year Comprehensive. In 2008, it merged with Claremont High School to form the new Calderglen High School.  History  Hunter High School takes its name from the anatomist and physician William Hunter (1718 ‚Äì 1783) and his younger brother, the surgeon John Hunter (1728 ‚Äì 1793) who were both born nearby at Long Calderwood.  Architecture  The building was designed by the Lanarkshire County architect, David Gordon Bannerman (1908-1986), and was officially opened on 16 December 1963 by John Gordon, the first-ever Provost of East Kilbride. It was the first secondary school in Lanarkshire built with specific provisions for courses leading to the \\"O\\" level certificate. At the opening ceremony, Provost Gordon praised the architects and builders for the fine job they had done and expressed that in his opinion the new building was already out of date because he felt that \\"...in the era of sputniks and moon rockets, while the school had many wonderful features, it could have been equipped with the modern closed circuit television equipment, to enable the streamlining of teaching.\\" By 1968, the school building had been extended to accommodate the improved Higher Learning Certificate syllabus.  Closure  Hunter High was one of four former East Kilbride school sites sold to Barratt Developments by Amec, who had purchased the land from South Lanarkshire Council in 2007 as part of the local authority‚Äôs schools‚Äô modernisation programme. Due to economic uncertainty, the abandoned building fell into an advanced state of dereliction and was later demolished in September 2009. The site was later redeveloped by Barratt along with Persimmon Homes under the marketing title \\"Gamekeepers Wynd\\".

Career  Mukasakindi had her best year in 2012, winning the Cagliari Marathon in May, with a personal best time of 2:40:18. This performance was within the time required by the IAAF for qualification for the 2012 Olympic Games, but Mukasakindi's bid to appear at the Games was initially rejected on the grounds that the Cagliari event was not an eligible race for qualification. In the end, however, she was permitted to run, and finished 101st in the event, with a time of 2:51:07. In the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Mukasakindi again competed in the women's marathon, one of seven Rwandans to compete in the games. She hoped to improve on her performance in London, and spent significant time preparing in Kenya and Italy, as well as in her homeland. Despite this training, her performance in the event was poor. Mukasakindi finished 126th in the race, out of a field of 133, and posted her worst competitive time at 3:05:57. She blamed the result on an ankle injury she had sustained in training, three days before the event; she had not thought it a problem before the race, but the ankle began causing her problems into the race, worsening after .

Available for the i386 and x86-64 architectures with a kernel customised for maximum performance and low-latency audio production, it has been recommended as a supported Linux platform for Harrison Mixbus.  Environment  The system is built on top of Debian, and was originally made with remastersys. Versions prior to, and including, version 6 were 32-bit only, running a 32-bit Linux kernel with the IRQ threading and rtirq-init patches activated by default. For computers with more than 4 GB of RAM there was a PAE version available. From AV Linux 2016 onwards, there are both 32-bit and 64-bit versions available. Window management as of version 6.0.2 is handled by the Xfce Desktop Environment. Previous versions used the LXDE Desktop Environment. It is possible to boot AV Linux from either a live CD or a hard drive. Audio playback and routing is handled by JACK (for advanced audio operation) or ALSA (for basic audio operation). Most any audio interface compatible with FFADO is usable out of the box.  Software  AV Linux is bundled with software for both everyday use and media production. As of AV Linux 2016, AV Linux gets its software packages from the KXStudio repositories, which are compatible with Debian, and therefore AV Linux. This reduces duplication of effort and allows the effort focus to be on a solid base distribution suitable for audio production. For this reason, AV Linux 2016 development has focused more on the base distribution than bundling it with large amounts of software, as it did with previous versions. Instead, the 2016 edition leaves it up to the users to decide what they want to install from the large repository of software available via KXStudio. = Audio = Preinstalled audio software includes: Ardour, Audacity, Calf Studio Gear, Carla, Guitarix, Hydrogen and MuseScore. = Graphics = Preinstalled graphics programs include: GIMP, Inkscape and Shotwell. = Video = Preinstalled software for video editing, playback, capture and 3D animation include: Blender, Cinelerra, Kdenlive and Openshot. = Everyday use = For typical day-to-day activities there are several programs available including Firefox and LibreOffice Suite.  Forum  AV Linux has an active forum. The forum was closed in September 2019 even if the development of AV Linux is planned to continue.

His channel surpassed one million subscribers in 2013, and his videos have been reviewed in publications such as Business Insider and The Washington Post. Grey created his YouTube account on 12 August 2010, and also posts videos on his secondary channels CGPGrey2 and CGP Play, describing the latter as \\"anti-professional streaming on a potato\\". In addition to video production, Grey is known for creating the audio podcast Hello Internet in 2014 with fellow educational YouTuber Brady Haran. Since 2015, he has also hosted the audio podcast Cortex with Myke Hurley, the co- founder of the Relay FM podcast network. Along with Philipp Dettmer and Dave Wiskus, Grey started the company Standard Broadcast LLC, which provides production and administrative support to digital creators. (Cited information missing in latest version.) However, CGP Grey left Standard; Wiskus stated that this was due to \\"philosophical and creative differences at the business level\\". Early life and career Grey grew up in the Long Island suburbs of New York City. He went to college in upstate New York, earning two degrees ‚Äì one in physics and another in sociology. His grandmother was born in Ireland, and when he was a child, his father applied for Irish citizenship on his behalf; Grey thus has dual American‚ÄìIrish citizenship. This enabled him to look into opportunities in the European Union, and its then-largest city, London. He later said that if he had not lived abroad while 'still free of life's anchors', he never would later in life, which made it all the more reason for him to go. He attended a masters in economics program in London, and stayed in the city for more than a decade. Grey decided to become a physics teacher in the UK; he went through a one-year course to earn a physics PGCE and graduated being qualified to teach physics in England and Wales. After spending several years teaching in the UK, Grey wanted to 'escape the system' and become self-employed. During the time he lived with his family in Hawaii to save money. His attempt 'failed miserably,' and he later returned to the UK hoping to find a teaching job and found one. He continued teaching until his career as a YouTube creator became sustainable. Since January 2014 he has co-hosted a general discussion podcast, Hello Internet, and began a second podcast, Cortex with Myke Hurley of Relay FM. Videos The YouTube channel CGP Grey features, among other things, Grey Explains, a series of explanatory videos on a range of subjects, including politics, geography, economics, and British culture. The videos feature Grey narrating over animations, stock footage, and still photographs. While nearly all of Grey's videos feature his voice, his face has never been shown in his videos, and Grey almost always has his face obscured when appearing in other people's videos; he generally uses a stick figure with glasses to represent himself. Grey has stated that the presentation style of his videos is influenced by that of Yahtzee Croshaw's Zero Punctuation series. Grey records his voice over the music playing in the background on Logic Pro X. The backing music of his early videos is usually credited to Kevin MacLeod. Since 2016, most videos contain music written by David Rees. He used to use Inkscape to make the drawings for his videos and Final Cut Pro X to edit them together from 2010 to early 2016, but now he uses Adobe After Effects to do both. The switch is primarily because he now works with other animators on most of his videos, and they use After Effects. Videos are released on the channel and via RSS. significantly less frequently than other YouTube channels; Grey has said that this is due to thorough research and scriptwriting, with the majority of videos never being finished. Grey's video that debunks popular misconceptions has been featured on CBS, as has his video about the history of the British royal family. Two videos differentiate London, England and the City of London, while explaining the history and government of the latter. Another two videos explaining copyright law and the Electoral College have been featured on Mashable. The channel also explains the economic disadvantages of US one-cent coins in a video titled Death to Pennies. Other videos, including How to Become Pope, have received media attention and used in instructional settings. Grey's video Humans Need Not Apply was covered by Business Insider and Huffington Post, and his animated video of Nick Bostrom's \\"The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant\\" was \\"unanimously praise[d]\\" by the Life Extension Advocacy Foundation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Grey released a video titled \\"Lockdown Productivity: Spaceship You\\" in which he provided advice on how to remain productive and sane during quarantine. Podcasts =Hello Internet= 200px In January 2014, Grey launched the podcast Hello Internet along with co-host Brady Haran, another educational YouTuber and online content creator. The podcast peaked as the No. 1 iTunes podcast in United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Canada, and Australia. It was selected as one of Apple's best new podcasts of 2014. The Guardian included the podcast among its 50 best of 2016, naming episode 66 (\\"A Classic Episode\\") its episode of the year. The paper described the podcast as having \\"in-depth debates and banter that is actually amusing.\\" Grey reported a podcast listenership of approximately \\"a quarter million\\" downloads per episode as of September 2015. The podcast features discussions pertaining to their lives as professional content creators for YouTube, as well as their interests and annoyances. Typical topics include technology etiquette; movie and TV show reviews; plane accidents; vexillology; futurology; and the differences between Grey's and Haran's personalities and lifestyles. Grey's and Haran's opinions and comments on feedback usually starts the next episode of the podcast. As a result of their conversations, Haran has been noted for reappropriating the term \\",\\" among other words, to refer to the unauthorized rehosting of online media. The podcast has an official flag called the \\"Nail & Gear\\" which was chosen from five candidates by a postal vote by the podcast's audience using an instant- runoff voting system. =Cortex= On 3 June 2015, Grey launched his second podcast, Cortex, with co-host Myke Hurley of Relay FM. Each episode, they discuss the methods and tools they employ to be productive and creative, and how they improve their self-employed lifestyles.

Background  During World War I the Serbian Army and Chetnik movement were in conflict with the Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and Army, which occupied most of Serbia and Macedonia. Bands of Chetniks organized the Toplica insurrection, which was quickly crushed by the Bulgarian soldiers and IMRO chetas. The post-war Treaty of Neuilly denied Bulgaria what it felt was its share of Macedonia and Pomoravlje. As result the state fell in a heavy situation having lost territory to Serbia, Greece and Romania with reparations to those countries. In the new formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the Chetnik movement ceased functioning as a guerrilla force. However, the IMRO began soon sending armed bands from Bulgaria into Serbian part of Macedonia to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the Bulgarian part of the local population. Also in 1921 IMRO created as a satellite organisation the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation (IWORO), which operated in the areas of Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad, ceded to Yugoslavia. In 1922 a new organization called Association against Bulgarian Bandits was launched by a former Chetniks to withstand the IMRO and the IWORO militants in the areas of Vardar Macedonia and the Western Outlands with Kosta Peƒáanac as leading figure in it.The Three Yugoslavias: State- Building And Legitimation, 1918‚Äì2005, Sabrina P. Ramet, Indiana University Press, 2006, , p. 47. In 1923 and 1924 during the apogee of interwar military activity according to IMRO statistics in the region of Yugoslav (Vardar) Macedonia operated 53 armed bands.–û–≥–Ω—è–Ω–æ–≤, –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª. –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è ‚Äì –ø—Ä–µ–∂–∏–≤—è–Ω–∞ —Å—ä–¥–±–∞, –°. 2003 (2 –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ), —Å. 143 ‚Äì 144.

At the same time IWORO carried out numerous assaults on the Tzaribrod‚ÄìBelgrade railway, especially on the bridges. Violent Serb counter-measures tended merely to cement the support to IMRO.Who Are the Macedonians? Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000, , p. 93. On the other hand, the reestablished in 1920 IMRO had its own left wing and it split over the ultimate goal of its activity. The right faction sought incorporation of all Macedonian territory into Bulgaria, while the left faction sought separate Macedonia that could join future Balkan Federation. In December 1921, left-leaning deserters of IMRO formed the official Macedonian Federative Organization. Violence between the two groups reinforced a political crisis growing public impression that Bulgarian government was unstable. Meanwhile, the government started military campaign against the IMRO in the Summer of 1921 using the Federative Organization as ally. The Premier Aleksandar Stamboliyski proclaimed as his aim the forming a new Balkan Federation of agrarian states. In March 1923 he signed the Treaty of Ni≈° with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO and IWORO carried out from Bulgarian territory. As result in the Summer of 1923, IMRO aided by radical officers organized coup d'√©tat in Bulgaria. The fall of the pro-Yugoslav government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski was a great success to the power of IMRO. Subsequently, part of the fleeing from Bulgaria federalists placed themselves in Serbian service, joining the Association against Bulgarian Bandits and fighting against IMRO. Serbian Prime Minister Ljubomir Davidoviƒá openly disagreed with such policy but Zika Lazic, head of the team that mobilized such guerillas, responded he did not find a better mechanism for mutual annihilation between current and former Bulgarian Komitadjis.–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è - –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞ —Å—ä–¥–±–∞, –¢–æ–º II, –ò–ö –ó–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–µ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1998, —Å—Ç—Ä.119.  Aftermath  The execution of the IMRO activist Kiril Gligorov by Yugoslav authorities in 1925. As a consequence, aided unofficially by the new government, the IMRO acted as a \\"state within a state\\" in Bulgaria, which was used as its hub for swift attacks against Yugoslavia. Because of this, at the end of the 1920s the Yugoslav-Bulgarian frontier was turned into the most fortified one in Europe.–í–æ–π–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ —Å–µ –≤—Ä—ä—â–∞, –ê–Ω—Ä–∏ –ü–æ–∑–∏ (–í—Ç–æ—Ä–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ, –ü–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç–∞-7, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1992) —Å—Ç—Ä. 33. The Serbian actions led to a significant reduction of the IMRO attacks. IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. Afterwards the Association against Bulgarian Bandits was gradually dissolved.

However, Umayyad authority under Marwan II was never fully restored, and the civil war flowed into the Abbasid Revolution (746‚Äì750) which culminated in the overthrow of the Umayyads and the establishment of the Abbasid Caliphate in 749/50. Thus a clear chronological delimitation of this conflict is not possible.  Usurpation of Yazid III  The civil war began with the overthrow of al-Walid II (), the son of Yazid II (). Al-Walid had been designated by his father as the successor of the latter's brother, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (), and although his accession had initially been well received due to Hisham's unpopularity and al-Walid's decision to increase army pay, the mood quickly changed. Al-Walid is reported to have been more interested in earthly pleasures than in religion, a reputation that may be confirmed by the decoration of the so-called \\"desert palaces\\" (including Qusayr Amra and Khirbat al-Mafjar) that have been attributed to him. His accession was resented by some members of the Umayyad family itself, and this hostility deepened when al-Walid designated his two underage sons as his heirs and flogged and imprisoned his cousin, Sulayman ibn Hisham. Further opposition arose through his persecution of the Qadariyya sect, and through his involvement in the ever-present rivalry between the northern (Qaysi/Mudari) and southern (Kalbi/Yemeni) Arab tribes. Like his father, al-Walid was seen as pro-Qays, especially following his appointment of Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi as governor of Iraq, and the torture and death of Yusuf's Yemeni predecessor, Khalid al-Qasri. It must be noted though that adherence was not clear cut, and men from both sides of the divide joined the other. In April 744, Yazid III, a son of al-Walid I (), entered Damascus. His supporters, bolstered by many Kalbis from the surrounding region, seized the town and proclaimed him caliph. Al-Walid II, who was at one of his desert palaces, fled to al-Bakhra near Palmyra. He mustered a small force of local Kalbis and Qaysis from Hims, but when Yazid III's far larger army under Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Hajjaj ibn Abd al- Malik arrived, most of his adherents fled. Al-Walid II was killed, and his severed head sent to Damascus. A pro-Qaysi uprising in Hims followed, under the Sufyanid Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani, but its march on Damascus was decisively defeated by the released Sulayman ibn Hisham. Abu Muhammad was thrown into prison in Damascus along with al-Walid II's sons. During his brief reign, Yazid showed himself an exemplary ruler, modelling himself on the pious Umar II (). He was favourably disposed to the Qadariyya, and consciously tried to disassociate himself from the frequent criticism of autocratic rule levelled at his Umayyad predecessors. Thus he promised to refrain from abuses of his power‚Äîmostly concerning widespread resentment at heavy taxation, the enrichment of the Umayyads and their adherents, the preference given to Syria over other parts of the Caliphate, and the long absence of soldiers on distant campaigns‚Äîand insisted that not only was he chosen by the community in an assembly (), rather than appointed, but that the community had the right to depose him if he failed in his duties or if they found someone more fit to lead them. At the same time, his reign saw the renewed ascendancy of the Yemenis, with Yusuf ibn Umar dismissed and imprisoned after trying, without success, to raise the Qaysis of Iraq into revolt. Yusuf's successor in Iraq and the East was the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, but he was soon replaced by the son of Umar II, Abdallah ibn Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. During his brief tenure, Mansur tried to dismiss the governor of Khurasan, Nasr ibn Sayyar, but the latter managed to maintain his post. Yazid died in September 744 after a reign of barely six months. Apparently due to the advice of the Qadariyya, he had appointed his brother, Ibrahim, as his successor, but he did not enjoy much support and was immediately faced with the revolt of Marwan II (), the grandson of Marwan I () and governor of Upper Mesopotamia.  Rise of Marwan II  Silver of Marwan II Marwan, who had for several years supervised the campaigns against the Byzantine Empire and the Khazars on the Caliphate's northwestern frontiers, had reportedly considered claiming the caliphate already at the death of al-Walid II, but a Kalbi rebellion in his rear had forced him to turn back. Yazid III appointed him to Upper Mesopotamia, and Marwan installed himself in the Qays-dominated city of Harran. =Syria= Syria with its major cities and administrative divisions () in the early Islamic period Following Yazid's death, Marwan marched into Syria, at first claiming that he came as the champion of al-Walid II's imprisoned sons. The local Qaysis of the northern districts of Qinnasrin and Hims flocking to his banner, until at some point on the road leading from Baalbek to Damascus, Marwan was confronted by Sulayman ibn Hisham. Likewise an experienced commander, Sulayman was at the head of his Dhakwaniyya private army and the Kalbis of southern Syria, but Marwan emerged victorious, with Sulayman fleeing to Damascus. Marwan obliged the captives from Sulayman's army to pledge allegiance to al-Walid II's sons, whereupon they were killed by Yazid ibn Khalid al-Qasri on Sulayman's orders, along with Yusuf al-Thaqafi. Sulayman and his adherents, including the caliph-designate Ibrahim, then fled to Palmyra. Marwan was thus able to enter Damascus peacefully in December 744, and was declared caliph. Marwan avoided reprisals and followed a conciliatory policy, allowing the Syrian districts () to choose their own governors. After a short while, Sulayman ibn Hisham and Ibrahim likewise gave up their resistance and came to Damascus to submit. Marwan's hold on power seemed secure, but he then chose to move his capital from Damascus to the military centre of Harran. As Gerald Hawting writes, \\"[f]or the first time a caliph seemed to have abandoned Syria altogether\\", and this act only served to fuel mistrust and resentment by the defeated Kalbis against Marwan. As a result, in summer 745 the Kalbis of Palestine rose in revolt under the local governor, Thabit ibn Nu'aym. The revolt soon spread across Syria, even to ostensibly loyal Qaysi areas like Hims. Marwan was thus obliged to return to Syria and reduce the revolt city by city. After forcing Hims to surrender, Marwan relieved Damascus from its siege by Yazid ibn Khalid al-Qasri, who was killed. He then rescued Tiberias, which was being besieged by Thabit ibn Nu'aym, and proceeded to defeat, capture and execute both Thabit and his sons. Following Marwan's attack on the Kalbi stronghold of Palmyra, the Kalbi leader Abrash al-Kalbi also made terms. With Syria apparently back in his grip, Marwan ordered the members of the Umayyad dynasty to gather around him and named his two sons as his heirs. Marwan then focused his attention on Iraq, where an army under Yazid ibn Hubayra was already trying to gain control of the province for him. Marwan assembled a new army to send to Ibn Hubayra's aid, but at Rusafa it mutinied, and accepted Sulayman ibn Hisham as its leader. The rebel army took Qinnasrin, and once again many Syrians dissatisfied with Marwan joined them, but Marwan brought the bulk of his forces from Iraq and defeated the rebels near Qinnasrin. Sulayman ibn Hisham was able to escape again to Palmyra, and thence flee to Kufa, but most of his surviving troops withdrew to Hims under the command of his brother Sa'id, where they were soon besieged by Marwan's forces. The siege lasted through the winter of 745‚Äì746, but in the end Hims surrendered. Enraged at the repeated Syrian revolts despite his earlier leniency, Marwan now, in the summer of 746, moved to prevent any further resistance by tearing down the walls of most important Syrian towns, including Damascus and possibly even Jerusalem. =Egypt and Iraq= Opposition to Marwan and his Qaysis was also evident in Egypt, where the governor Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami, a member of the traditionally dominant local Arab settler community, tried to use the turmoil of the civil war to restore its pre-eminence in Egyptian affairs: the Syrians were forcibly expelled from the capital Fustat, and Hafs set about recruiting a force of 30,000 men, named after him, from among the native non-Arab converts ( and ). Marwan sent Hasan ibn Atahiya to replace him and ordered the disbanded, but the latter refused to accept the order to disband and mutinied, besieging the new governor in his residence until he and his both were forced to leave Egypt. Hafs, though unwilling, was restored by the mutinous troops as governor. In the next year, 745, Marwan dispatched a new governor, Hawthara ibn Suhayl al-Bahili, at the head of a large Syrian army. Despite his supporters' eagerness to resist, Hafs proved willing to surrender his position. Hawthara took Fustat without opposition, but immediately launched a purge, to which Hafs and several leaders fell victim. Silver of Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya, minted in Jayy In the meantime, in Iraq, Marwan's rebellion coincided with an Alid uprising in Kufa, headed by Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya, in October 744. The uprising was soon suppressed by Yazid III's governor, Abdallah ibn Umar, and his Syrian troops, but Ibn Mu'awiya had managed to escape to Jibal. There volunteers opposed to the Umayyad regime continued to flock to his banner, and he managed to extend his control over large parts of Persia, including most of Jibal, Ahwaz, Fars and Kerman. He established his residence first at Isfahan and then at Istakhr. Marwan II appointed a supporter of his own, the Qaysi Nadr ibn Sa'id al-Harashi, as governor of Iraq, but Abdallah ibn Umar retained the loyalty of the Kalbi majority of the Syrian troops, and for several months the two rival governors and their troops confronted and skirmished at each other around al-Hira. This conflict was abruptly ended with the Kharijite revolt which had begun among the Banu Rabi'ah tribes in Upper Mesopotamia. Although \\"northerners\\", the Rabi'a, and especially the Banu Shayban, were enemies of the Mudar and Qays and opposed Marwan II's takeover. The revolt was initially led by Sa'id ibn Bahdal, but he died soon of the plague, and was succeeded by al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani. In early 745 they invaded Iraq and defeated both rival Umayyad governors, who had joined forces, in April/May 745. Nadr fled back to Syria to join Marwan, but Ibn Umar and his followers withdrew to Wasit. In August 745 however Ibn Umar and his supporters surrendered and even embraced Kharijism and Dahhak‚Äîwho was not even of the Quraysh tribe of Muhammad‚Äîas their caliph. Ibn Umar was appointed as Dahhak's governor for Wasit, eastern Iraq, and western Persia, while Dahhak governed western Iraq from Kufa. Taking advantage of the Syrian revolt against Marwan, Dahhak returned to Upper Mesopotamia‚Äîprobably in spring 746‚Äîand while Marwan was occupied by the siege of Hims, he seized Mosul. More men flocked to his banner, whether out of opposition to Marwan, like Sulayman ibn Hisham and the remnant of his Dhakwaniyya, or because he offered high wages to his followers, and his army is said to have reached 120,000 men. Marwan sent his son Abdallah to oppose Dahhak, but the Kharijite leader managed to blockade him in Nisibis. Once Hims had fallen, however, Marwan himself campaigned against Dahhak, and in a battle at al-Ghazz in Kafartuta in August/September 746, Dahhak was killed and the Kharijites had to abandon Upper Mesopotamia. The Kharijites now selected Abu Dulaf as their leader, and on the advice of Sulayman ibn Hisham they withdrew to the eastern bank of the Tigris. As Marwan was able to call upon more and more troops to face the Kharijites, however, they were forced to abandon even this position and withdraw further east. Marwan then sent Yazid ibn Hubayra to establish control over Iraq, which he accomplished this by the summer of 747: after defeating the Kharijite governor of Kufa and taking the city, Ibn Hyubayra marched on Wasit, where he took Abdallah ibn Umar prisoner. Marwan's capture of Iraq left Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya as the only major leader opposing the Umayyad caliph, and his domain in western Persia became a refuge for the defeated Kharijites of Iraq, and every other opponent of Marwan, including members of the Umayyad family‚Äînotably Sulayman ibn Hisham‚Äîand even a few Abbasids. Nevertheless, in a short time Ibn Mu'awiya's forces suffered a decisive defeat by one of Ibn Hubayra's generals. Ibn Mu'awiya fled to Khurasan, where the leader of the Abbasid Revolution, Abu Muslim, had him executed, while Sulayman ibn Hisham and Mansur ibn Jumhur fled to India, where they remained until they died. Khurasan and the Abbasid Revolution Khurasan, the northeasternmost province of the Caliphate, had not escaped the turmoils of the civil war. Yazid III's accession posed a threat to the longtime governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, as the numerous Yemenis in Khurasan sought to replace him with their champion, Juday al-Kirmani. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd tribe, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders, but his efforts only led to a general uprising by these tribes under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering intertribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the Muhallabids, an Azdi family that had been purged after rebelling in 720, an act which had since become a symbol of Yemeni resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime. Nasr imprisoned al-Kirmani in the provincial capital, Merv, but he managed to escape in summer 744. Despite Nasr's eventual re-confirmation as governor by Yazid, the rebellion spread among the Arabs of Khurasan, so that Nasr was forced to turn to the exiled rebel al-Harith ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani had played a major role in the latter's defeat years ago, and Ibn Surayj's northern Arab (Tamimi) origin made him a natural enemy of the Yemenis. Ibn Surayj however had other designs; gathering a following of many of the Tamimis and the disaffected Arabs of the province, he launched an attack on Merv in March 746. After it failed, he made common cause with al-Kirmani. With Marwan II still trying to consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, and western Persia controlled by the Kharijites under Ibn Mu'awiya, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement. The allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv towards the end of the year, and he retreated to the Qaysi stronghold of Nishapur. Within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the latter's death. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in Merv, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto ambivalent towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qaysis of Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Merv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimiyya uprising under Abu Muslim. Negotiations commenced, but were almost broken off when a member of Nasr's entourage, an embittered son of Ibn Surayj, attacked and killed al-Kirmani. The two sides were able to tentatively settle their differences, and Nasr re-occupied his seat in Merv. Proclamation of Abu'l-Abbas al-Saffah as the first Abbasid Caliph, from Balami's The exact origins and nature of the Hashimiyya movement are debated among scholars, but by the 740s this movement, which supported the overthrow of the Umayyads and their replacement by a \\"chosen one from the family of Muhammad\\" (), had spread widely among the Arabs of Khurasan. In 746 or 747, Abu Muslim was sent to Khurasan by the Abbasid imam, Ibrahim, to assume the leadership of the sect there, possibly in order to bring it more under Abbasid control. In a short time Abu Muslim established his control of the Khurasani Hashimiyya, and in summer 747, at the Yemeni village of Sikadanj, the black banners were unfurled, the prayer read in the name of the Abbasid imam, and the Abbasid Revolution begun. Abu Muslim soon took advantage of the barely mended Mudari‚ÄìYemeni hostility, by persuading al-Kirmani's son and successor Ali that Nasr had been involved in his father's murder. As a result, both Ali al-Kirmani and Nasr separately appealed for aid against each other to Abu Muslim, who now held the balance of power. The latter eventually chose to support the Yemenis, and on 14 February 748, Abu Muslim's army occupied Merv. Nasr ibn Sayyar once again fled to Nishapur, while Abu Muslim sent the Hashimiyya forces under Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i to pursue him. Nasr was forced to abandon Nishapur too after his son Tamim was defeated at Tus, and retreat to the region of Qumis, on the western borderlands of Khurasan. At this point, the long-awaited reinforcements from the Caliph arrived, but their general and Nasr failed to coordinate their movements, and Qahtaba was able to defeat the caliphal army at Gurgan in August 748 and capture Rayy. Following the capture of Nishapur, Abu Muslim consolidated his position in Khurasan by murdering Ali ibn Juday al-Kirmani and his brother Uthman. Qahtaba's son al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba led the siege of Nihawand, where the remnants of the caliphal armies and Nasr ibn Sayyar's followers made their last stand. In March 749, Qahtaba defeated another, bigger, caliphal army near Isfahan. Bereft of hope of further aid, Nihawand surrendered two or three months later, opening the way to Iraq. Qahtaba led his troops towards Kufa, but on the way they were confronted by Marwan II's governor Yazid ibn Hubayra. After a surprise night attack in which Qahtaba was killed on 27 August 749, Ibn Hubayra was forced to withdraw to Wasit, and al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba led his army into Kufa on 2 September. As imam Ibrahim had been imprisoned and executed by Marwan II, he was succeeded by his brother, Abu'l-Abbas, whom the army leaders proclaimed as caliph on 28 November. In January 750, at the Battle of the Greater Zab, the Abbasid army decisively defeated the Umayyad army led by Marwan II in person. Pursued by the Abbasids, Marwan was forced to flee to Syria and then Egypt, where he was finally captured and executed in August 750, putting an end to the Umayyad Caliphate.

History Charnwood College can trace its history back to 1690 as the Hickling School for Girls. Burleigh Community College and Garendon High School were merged in 2012, under the working name of 'Thorpe Hill Campus'. The School was officially launched as Charnwood College in 2013. The school converted to academy status in April 2015 and is now operated by the David Ross Education Trust. School traditions and other information Charnwood College provides an all-through education for students aged 11‚Äì19 across Loughborough. Charnwood College was the first time two upper schools had been merged in Leicestershire. Charnwood college inherited the supporters of the two former schools, the Burleigh Pig and the Garendon Stag. The Burleigh Pig became an unofficial supporter and eventually became seen as an official supporter after the installation of a statue of a bronze boar. The Garendon Stag has always been the official supporter of Garendon High School, the stag was adopted as deer were kept on Garendon Park (the School's namesake) and the stag was also featured on the Coat of Arms of the De Lisle family (the owners of the Garendon Park estate), the school still owns a set of mounted antlers from a Stag that lived on the Garendon Park Estate. Campus Charnwood College has a campus, with extensive sports facilities including a swimming pool, two gymnasiums, two work-out gyms, a 3G pitch (formerly a dry play pitch), a spate dry play pitch, two tennis courts and three multisports halls. It also has multiple specialist teaching blocks and extensive IT equipment. There is also an off campus boarding house, called Field House which attracts students from around the world.

Work on the building began in 1969 and was completed in 1972. As of 2019 it is the second tallest building in Cape Town. The 34-degree diagonal twist, which puts it on a north- south axis, reduces sun loads on the fa√ßades, thereby reducing pressure on the air-conditioning system. To further shield the fa√ßades, a pre-cast screen is mounted on every floor, allowing good air flow and cutting off direct sun rays. This unique orientation also means that all the offices have views of either the mountain or the harbour, and that none stare straight into the fa√ßades of the surrounding buildings. In 2006 the building was sold along with two other office buildings in Cape Town for R300 million and was at the time the largest Grade A commercial property in the city. Flanked by John Skotness' Mythological Landscape steel-and-bronze sculpture, the piazza below is a popular public space for office workers and visitors to the city. The building provides a focal point for Thibault Square. In 2008 the building was acknowledged in a national survey by the South African Institute of Architecture to be one of the country‚Äôs \\"good buildings\\".

The extension is analytic on the open disk. The extension has an important equivariance property: if the homeomorphism is composed on either side with a M√∂bius transformation preserving the unit circle the extension is also obtained by composition with the same M√∂bius transformation. If the homeomorphism is quasisymmetric, the diffeomorphism is quasiconformal. An extension for quasisymmetric homeomorphisms had previously been given by Lars Ahlfors and Arne Beurling; a different equivariant construction had been given in 1985 by Pekka Tukia. Equivariant extensions have important applications in Teichm√ºller theory, for example they lead to a quick proof of the contractibility of the Teichm√ºller space of a Fuchsian group. Definition By the Rad√≥‚ÄìKneser‚ÄìChoquet theorem, the Poisson integral :\\\\displaystyle{F_f(re^{i\\\\theta}) ={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(\\\\varphi)\\\\cdot {1- r^2\\\\over 1 - 2r\\\\cos (\\\\theta -\\\\varphi) + r^2}\\\\,d\\\\varphi,} of a homeomorphism f of the circle defines a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk extending f. If f is quasisymmetric, the extension is not necessarily quasiconformal, i.e. the complex dilatation :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mu(z)={\\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}}F_f\\\\over \\\\partial_z F_f},} does not necessarily satisfy :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sup_{z<1} \\\\mu(z) < 1.} However F can be used to define another analytic extension Hf of f‚àí1 which does satisfy this condition. It follows that :\\\\displaystyle{E(f)=H_{f^{-1}}} is the required extension. For a < 1 define the M√∂bius transformation :\\\\displaystyle{g_a(z)= {z-a\\\\over 1- \\\\overline{a}z}.} It preserves the unit circle and unit disk sending a to 0. If g is any M√∂bius transformation preserving the unit circle and disk, then :\\\\displaystyle{F_{f\\\\circ g} = F_f\\\\circ g.} For a < 1 define :\\\\displaystyle{w=H_f(a)} to be the unique w with w < 1 and :\\\\displaystyle{F_{g_a\\\\circ f}(w) =0.} For a =1 set :\\\\displaystyle{H_f(a)=f^{-1}(a).} Properties *Compatibility with M√∂bius transformations. By construction ::\\\\displaystyle{H_{g\\\\circ f \\\\circ h} = h^{-1}\\\\circ H_f \\\\circ g^{-1}} :for any M√∂bius transformations g and h preserving the unit circle and disk. *Functional equation. If a, b < 1 and ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi(a,b)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\left({f(e^{i\\\\theta}) -b\\\\over 1-\\\\overline{b}f(e^{i\\\\theta})}\\\\right) {1-a^2\\\\over a-e^{i\\\\theta}^2}\\\\, d\\\\theta}, :then \\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi(a,b) =0}. *Continuity. If a, b < 1, define ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi(a,b)= F_{g_a\\\\circ f}(b)={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} g_a\\\\circ f\\\\circ g_{-b}(e^{i\\\\theta})\\\\, d\\\\theta={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\left({f(e^{i\\\\theta}) -b\\\\over 1-\\\\overline{b}f(e^{i\\\\theta})}\\\\right) {1-a^2\\\\over a-e^{i\\\\theta}^2}\\\\, d\\\\theta} :If zn and wn lie in the unit disk and tend to z and w and homeomorphisms of the circle are defined by ::\\\\displaystyle{f_n=g_{z_n}\\\\circ f \\\\circ g_{-w_n},} :then fn tends almost everywhere to :*gz ‚àò f ‚àò g‚àíw if z, w < 1; :*gz ‚àò f (w) if z < 1 and w = 1; :*‚àíz if z =1 and w ‚â§ 1 with w ‚â† f‚àí1(z). :By the dominated convergence theorem, it follows that Œ¶(zn,wn) has a non-zero limit if w ‚â† Hf(z). This implies that Hf is continuous on the closed unit disk. Indeed otherwise, by compactness, there would be a sequence zn tending to z in the closed disk, with wn = Hf(zn) tending to a limit w ‚â† Hf(z). But then Œ¶(zn,wn) = 0 so has limit zero, a contradiction, since w ‚â† Hf(z). *Smoothness and non-vanishing Jacobian on open disk. Hf is smooth with nowhere vanishing Jacobian on z < 1\\\\. In fact, because of the compatibility with M√∂bius transformations, it suffices to check that Hf is smooth near 0 and has non-vanishing derivative at 0. :If f has Fourier series ::\\\\displaystyle{f(e^{i\\\\theta}) = \\\\sum_m a_m e^{im\\\\theta},} :then the derivatives of Ff at 0 are given by ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_z F_f (0)= a_{1},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}} F_f(0) =a_{-1}.} :Thus the Jacobian of Ff at 0 is given by :: \\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_z F_f(0)^2 - \\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}} F_f(0)^2 = a_{1}^2 - a_{-1}^2.} :Since Ff is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, its Jacobian is positive: ::\\\\displaystyle{a_{1}^2 - a_{-1}^2 >0.} :The function Œ¶(z,w) is analytic and so smooth. Its derivatives at (0,0) are given by ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi_z(0,0)=a_{-1},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\Phi_{\\\\overline{z}}(0,0)=a_{1},\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi_{w}(0,0) = -1,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\Phi_{\\\\overline{w}}(0,0) = {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(e^{i\\\\theta})^2\\\\, d\\\\theta=b.} :Direct calculation shows that ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Phi_{w}(0,0)^2 - \\\\Phi_{\\\\overline{w}}(0,0)^2=1-\\\\left{1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(e^{i\\\\theta})^2 \\\\, d\\\\theta\\\\right^2 \\\\ge 0.} :by the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality. If the right hand side vanished, then equality would occur in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality forcing ::\\\\displaystyle{f(e^{i\\\\theta}) =\\\\zeta \\\\overline{f(e^{i\\\\theta})}} :for some Œ∂ in T and for all Œ∏, a contradiction since f assumes all values in T. The left hand side is therefore strictly positive and b < 1\\\\. :Consequently the implicit function theorem can be applied. It implies that Hf(z) is smooth near o. Its Jacobian can be computed by implicit differentiation: ::\\\\displaystyle{\\\\partial_z H_f(0)^2 - \\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}}H_f(0)^2 = {\\\\Phi_z(0,0)^2 - \\\\Phi_{\\\\overline{z}}(0,0)^2 \\\\over \\\\Phi_w(0,0)^2 -\\\\Phi_{\\\\overline{w}}(0,0)^2} >0.} :Moreover ::\\\\displaystyle{{\\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}}H_f (0)\\\\over \\\\partial_{z} H_f(0)}=g_b\\\\left(-{a_{-1}\\\\over \\\\overline{a_{1}}}\\\\right).} *Homeomorphism on closed disk and diffeomorphism on open disk. It is enough to show that Hf is a homeomorphism. By continuity its image is compact so closed. The non-vanishing of the Jacobian, implies that Hf is an open mapping on the unit disk, so that the image of the open disk is open. Hence the image of the closed disk is an open and closed subset of the closed disk. By connectivity, it must be the whole disk. For w < 1, the inverse image of w is closed, so compact, and entirely contained in the open disk. Since Hf is locally a homeomorphism, it must be a finite set. The set of points w in the open disk with exactly n preimages is open. By connectivity every point has the same number N of preimages. Since the open disk is simply connected, N = 1. (In fact taking any preimage of the origin, every radial line has a unique lifting to a preimage, and so there is an open subset of the unit disk mapping homeomorphically onto the open disc. If N > 1, its complement would also have to be open, contradicting connectivity.) Extension of quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms In this section it is established that the extension of a quasisymmetric homeomorphism is quasiconformal. Fundamental use is made of the notion of quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphism. A homeomorphism f of the circle is quasisymmetric if there are constants a, b > 0 such that :\\\\displaystyle{{f(z_1)-f(z_2)\\\\over f(z_1)-f(z_3)} \\\\le a {z_1-z_2^b\\\\over z_1-z_3^b}.} It is ''quasi-M√∂bius'' is there are constants ''c'', ''d'' > 0 such that :\\\\displaystyle{(f(z_1),f(z_2);f(z_3),f(z_4)) \\\\le c (z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)^d,} where :\\\\displaystyle{ (z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)={(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)\\\\over(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)}} denotes the cross-ratio. If f is quasisymmetric then it is also quasi-M√∂bius, with c = a2 and d = b: this follows by multiplying the first inequality for (z1,z3,z4) and (z2,z4,z3). It is immediate that the quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphisms are closed under the operations of inversion and composition. The complex dilatation Œº of a diffeomorphism F of the unit disk is defined by :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mu_F(z)={\\\\partial_{\\\\overline{z}}F(z)\\\\over \\\\partial_z F(z)}.} If F and G are diffeomorphisms of the disk, then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mu_{G\\\\circ F^{-1}}\\\\circ F={F_z\\\\over \\\\overline{F_z}} {\\\\mu_G-\\\\mu_F\\\\over 1 -\\\\overline{\\\\mu_F}\\\\mu_G}.} In particular if G is holomorphic, then :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mu_{F\\\\circ G^{-1}} \\\\circ G = {G_z\\\\over \\\\overline{G_z}} \\\\mu_F,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mu_{G^{-1}\\\\circ F}=\\\\mu_F.} When F = Hf, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mu_F(0)=g_b\\\\left( -{a_{-1}\\\\over \\\\overline{a_{1}}}\\\\right),} where :\\\\displaystyle{a_{\\\\pm 1}={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(e^{i\\\\theta})e^{\\\\mp i\\\\theta} \\\\, d\\\\theta,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, b={1\\\\over 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(e^{i\\\\theta})^2 \\\\, d\\\\theta.} To prove that F = Hf is quasiconformal amounts to showing that :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\\\\\mu_F\\\\_\\\\infty < 1.} Since f ia a quasi- M√∂bius homeomorphism the compositions g1 ‚àò f ‚àò g2 with gi M√∂bius transformations satisfy exactly the same estimates, since M√∂bius transformations preserve the cross ratio. So to prove that Hf is quasiconformal it suffices to show that if f is any quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphism fixing 1, i and ‚àíi, with fixed c and d, then the quantities :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\Lambda(f)=\\\\leftg_b\\\\left( -{a_{-1}\\\\over \\\\overline{a_{1}}}\\\\right)\\\\right} have an upper bound strictly less than one. On the other hand if f is quasi-M√∂bius and fixes 1, i and ‚àíi, then f satisfies a H√∂lder continuity condition: :\\\\displaystyle{f(z)-f(w)\\\\le C z-w^d,} for another positive constant C independent of f. The same is true for the f‚àí1's. But then the Arzel√†‚ÄìAscoli theorem implies these homeomorphisms form a compact subset in C(T). The non-linear functional Œõ is continuous on this subset and therefore attains its upper bound at some f0. On the other hand Œõ(f0) < 1, so the upper bound is strictly less than 1. The uniform H√∂lder estimate for f is established in as follows. Take z, w in T. *If z ‚àí 1 ‚â§ 1/4 and z - w ‚â§ 1/8, then z ¬± i ‚â• 1/4 and w ¬± i ‚â• 1/8. But then ::\\\\displaystyle{(w,i; z,-i) \\\\le 16z-w,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (f(w),i; f(z),-i) \\\\ge f(z)-f(w)/8,} :so there is a corresponding H√∂lder estimate. *If z - w ‚â• 1/8, the H√∂lder estimate is trivial since f(z) - f(w) ‚â§ 2. *If z - 1 ‚â• 1/4, then w - Œ∂ ‚â• 1/4 for Œ∂ = i or ‚àíi. But then ::\\\\displaystyle{ (z,\\\\zeta;w,1) \\\\le 8z-w,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (f(z),\\\\zeta; f(w),1)\\\\ge f(z)-f(w)/8,} :so there is a corresponding H√∂lder estimate. Comment. In fact every quasi-M√∂bius homeomorphism f is also quasisymmetric. This follows using the Douady‚ÄìEarle extension, since every quasiconformal homeomorphism of the unit disk induces a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the unit circle. It can also be proved directly, following :Indeed it is immediate that if f is quasi-M√∂bius so is its inverse. It then follows that f (and hence f‚Äì1) is H√∂lder continuous. To see this, let S be the set of cube roots of unity, so that if a ‚â† b in S, then a ‚àí b = 2 sin /3 = . To prove a H√∂lder estimate, it can be assumed that x ‚Äì y is uniformly small. Then both x and y are greater than a fixed distance away from a, b in S with a ‚â† b, so the estimate follows by applying the quasi-M√∂bius inequality to x, a, y, b. To check that f is quasisymmetric, it suffices to find a uniform upper bound for f(x) ‚àí f(y) / f(x) ‚àí f(z) in the case of a triple with x ‚àí z = x ‚àí y, uniformly small. In this case there is a point w at a distance greater than 1 from x, y and z. Applying the quasi-M√∂bius inequality to x, w, y and z yields the required upper bound.

He was then officially appointed Bishop of Schwerin, however, he was never able to actually exercise power there.  Life  Potho was a member of a Czech-speaking Bohemian noble family based at Pottenstein Castle (now Pot≈°tejn in the Czech Republic). They were possibly related to the Bavarian Counts Palatine. It is not known whether he spoke German himself. In 1356, Potho was appointed canon of the cathedral in Olomouc. In 1371, he was mentioned as Archdeacon in Prague and papal chaplain. He originally supported the Popes in Avignon, however, after King Wenceslaus proposed him as the next Bishop of M√ºnster, he changed sides and support Pope Urban VI in Rome. En route to M√ºnster, Potho and his entourage were attacked near Hamm by the Count of the Marck. He lost his valuables and barely managed to evade being taken prisoner. King Wenceslaus tried in vain to exert his influence to have the stolen money returned. Immediately after Potho's arrival in M√ºnster, he created several indulgences, with papal permission. He urged the faithful to try to acquire these. A diocesan synod was probably not held during his time in office. He was later described as greedy, however, contemporary documents suggest that he was genuinely interested in religious affairs. On the other hand, Potho showed little interest in the castles in his territory. When he was short of money, he had to pledge Horstmar Castle to the Count of Hoya. He probably never signed a treaty with the Estates of his bishopric. Potho took no notable initiatives for the temporal government of his bishopric. During his reign, Rheda was besieged by an alliance between M√ºnster and several other bishops against the Counts of Tecklenburg, however, this alliance had already been created before his arrival. During his reign, a Public Peace was agreed, and a peace treaty was agreed with the counts of Tecklenburg. However, the dispute with Tecklenburg would erupt again shortly afterwards. As Potho was unfamiliar with the political situation in his bishopric, the cathedral chapter tasked his provost Heidenreich Wolf of L√ºdinghausen with the administration of the bishopric . It is not clear whether the chapter demanded his resignation. In any case, he realized that he was unable to fulfill his duties as prince-bishop and on 13 October 1382, he resigned. He recommended Rupert of J√ºlich-Berg as his successor, however, the chapter elected L√ºdinghausen instead. Potho's contemporaries generally held a negative view of his performance. Several epigrams accuse him of greed and insobriety. One cause of his bad reputation may have been his lack of language skills. He did not understand the Low German dialect spoken in M√ºnster and this made relations with his subjects problematic. After Potho resignation in M√ºnster, Potho moved to the episcopal see of Schwerin. At the time, B√ºtzow Castle was the residence of the bishops of Schwerin. However, the cathedral chapter refused to recognize him and elected John IV Junge instead. John IV was murdered in 1389 by one of his captains.August B. Michaelis and Julius Wilhelm Hamberger: Einleitung zu einer volst√§ndigen Geschichte der Chur- und F√ºrstlichen H√§user in Teutschland, vol. 2, Meyer, 1760, p. 408 Even after John IV's death, Potho was unable to take up government.Julius Wiggers: Kirchengeschichte Mecklenburgs, Hinstorff, 1840, p. 48 ff He lived in Stralsund until his death.He died before 11 August 1390, as a deed from that date mentions Rudolph III as bishop of Schwerin It is unknown where Potho was buried.

Alongside Jones, the band's line-up includes Jacqueline Irvine, David Jack, Steve Morrison, S√©an McLaughlin and Catrin Pryce-Jones. To date, the band has released two studio albums, The Eleventh Hour (2011) and A Conversation Well Rehearsed (2012), with a third, A Hollow Hole Of Riches, due for release on 4 March 2014. History =Formation and The Eleventh Hour (2011)= In late 2010, Idlewild entered an indefinite hiatus. Guitarist and backing vocalist, Jones, subsequently formed The Birthday Suit the following year after writing material for his second solo album. Jones noted: > I started making a second solo record, then got sick of it. I began writing > a set of completely new songs which turned out to have more of an indie rock > sound, and it felt more like band material than solo stuff. Even though I > wrote it by myself at home, it wouldn‚Äôt have been right to record it alone, > so I got a small band together. The name of The Birthday Suit was sort of an > in-joke that stuck. Jones elaborated, \\"With the addition of a few friends and local musicians it took on a new life and it was really apparent that it was a group of people I really wanted to play with.\\" The band released its debut album, The Eleventh Hour, in late 2011, and followed its release with multiple performances in Glasgow and Edinburgh during the next year. The band performed at T in the Park and Wickerman Festival, and subsequently began working on a follow-up album. =A Conversation Well Rehearsed (2012)= A single, \\"Less Worthless Years\\", was released in July 2012, with an accompanying EP release that features full-band versions of songs from Jones' debut solo album, A Sentimental Education (2010). The band's second studio album, A Conversation Well Rehearsed was released on 3 December 2012. The album was listed in 19th place in the Clean Slate Music website's \\"Top 21 Albums of 2012\\" list, although the website write that the second album \\"doesn‚Äôt carry the punch\\" of the band's debut album. =A Hollow Hole of Riches (2013-present)= In October 2013, the band released a new single, \\"A Bigger World\\", featuring Scott Hutchison of Frightened Rabbit, and announced the release of its third studio album, A Hollow Hole of Riches. Musical influences Jones revealed in a 2012 interview that Thurston Moore, of American band, Sonic Youth, was a seminal influence as Moore facilitated a realisation that \\"there was more to the guitar than just playing really fast and learning scale\\". Perspectives Journalists have queried Jones on his approach within the Birthday Suit in relation to Idlewild and the frontman has been open about his thoughts. In his interview with Fame magazine, Jones revealed that starting \\"at the bottom again\\" was the most difficult aspect of starting a new band; while in a guest column for Q Music, Jones explored the past in greater detail: > I honestly think we made some great records, and maybe we will do again some > day, but without the rose tinted glasses I probably had fixed to my face at > the time, I realise there were definitely opportunities squandered. Too late > in the bands life came the notion that throwing yourself around the stage > and making a racket was great in a club but maybe didn't translate to an > arena or stadium crowd. We needed to be more ambitious with our shows. It > wasn't just about having a laugh. Being a stadium band was an artform. One > all too foreign to us. In an interview with the website, Street Savvy, Jones focused on The Birthday Suit, stating that he thought that \\"if you can make yourself recognisable by your music and your playing then you must be doing something right\\", in response to a question on what his band can offer the \\"music industry\\"; Jones further explained, in respect to his aspirations for the Birthday Suit's music, \\"Enjoyment. That's all I can ask. I'm not going to pretend I want to change the world with my songs because I wouldn't know where to start.

Meet thinks that his wife Unatti (Karishma Tanna) is having an affair with her boss; Prem thinks that his wife Tulsi (Manjari Fadnis) doesn't spend quality time with him and Amar feels that his wife Mamta (Sonalee Kulkarni) is more concerned about their son, Pappu. One day, the men receive an invite from their college, SLUTS (Sri Lalchand University of Technology and Science), to attend their college reunion. Their wives don't come with them, so the three decide to use the trip to get up to mischief in order to escape their unhappy marriages. When they arrive, they find that everyone else is behaving in an overly conservative manner. This is due to the fear of Principal Robert Pereira (Pradeep Rawat), who hangs people naked on a tree if they disagree with his rules. They find out that a former student, Hardik (Suresh Menon), is in a mental asylum because of the principal's deeds. Meanwhile, Prem meets one of his former teachers, Rose (Maryam Zakaria), who is seen washing her cleavage with water when ice-cream falls on her and is attracted to her. Meet meets Marlow (Kainaat Arora) who causes the car horn to blare because of her big breasts and is attracted to her. Amar meets Mary (Bruna Abdullah) who seductively opens a bottlecork by her breasts and is attracted to her. The men begin to initiate affairs with the women, but soon find out that Rose, Mary and Marlow are relatives to Robert. The men's wives later arrive at the college, intending on joining them at the reunion. The trio receive an MMS message containing footage of each of them getting intimate, and succeed in hiding the video from their wives. They find out that it was Hardik who sent the video, and he blackmails them. Their task is to kill Robert in order to fulfill Hardik's revenge, or else he will show the footage to their wives. They fail in killing him, so they decide to try to delete the videos off Hardik's phone. They succeed and continue to spend time at the reunion. On the last day, Robert mixes a love potion into the soup, which causes people to deal out those they are attracted too. The trio end up being with Rose, Mary and Marlow, and Robert catches them red handed. While being chased by Robert, the girls reveal to the men that he is impotent. When the trio end up on the roof of a building, Hardik pushes Robert, who slides down the roof and hangs on to a bar. The men try to save him but Hardik pushes them, too, and they hang onto Robert. The girls come and push Hardik off the roof and he hangs on to Meet. The three tell Robert the truth about not making love with Marlow, Mary and Rose. The girls strip to their underwear to make a rope out of their clothes but fail. They decide to strip naked to extend the rope with their bras and panties, but the boys fall and end up in the hospital. Their wives angrily ask them what exactly happened that night. Robert calmly replies that due to a misunderstood affair, their husbands suffered this consequence. Shortly later, a doctor comes and informs Robert that he is no more impotent since the blood now properly flows all over his body due to the pressure generated while hanging on the bar. Hardik marries Marlow. The film ends with Amar, Meet and Prem having sex with their respectful wives. Robert and Hardik too have sex with Rose and Marlow. Mary is the one left alone who while bathing naked in a bathtub asks the audience to meet her.

Alongside Hartnell, the story also focused on the behind-the-scene events with the production staff, including the involvement of Sydney Newman, Verity Lambert and Waris Hussein. The television film received positive feedback after its broadcast and received a number of award nominations. Following his role in the film, Bradley would take part in Doctor Who in the role of the First Doctor, for the 2017 episodes \\"The Doctor Falls\\" and \\"Twice Upon a Time\\", as well as for a series of audio adventures for Big Finish Productions.https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/first-doctor-details Synopsis In 1963, Sydney Newman (Brian Cox) becomes the BBC's new Head of Drama. To plug a gap between the broadcasts of Grandstand and Juke Box Jury, he devises a new science-fiction series, to be entitled \\"Doctor Who\\", which will cater to children and adults alike, and feature a central character who is an old man and a \\"doctor\\". Newman recruits Verity Lambert (Jessica Raine) to head the programme as producer, despite the difficulties she faces from others in her new role. Lambert and Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan), the programme's director, recruit William Hartnell (David Bradley) for the role of The Doctor, despite some trepidation from him over how it will aid his acting career. After Lambert strengthens her assertiveness and secures a set piece for the programme that resembles the interior of the TARDIS, production of the pilot episode is beset by difficulties. Newman dislikes the end results and orders a re-shoot, including a request for Hartnell's character to be gentler and kinder on screen. Lambert and Hussein manage to complete the re-shoot in time for the pilot to be broadcast on its scheduled transmission date. Upon learning that the programme is to be cancelled, due to the diminished audience the pilot episode received in the wake of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Lambert successfully appeals to Newman for it to be broadcast again before the second episode is transmitted. Although Newman reluctantly goes against his belief not to include monsters into Doctor Who, by agreeing to let Lambert introduce creatures called the Daleks into the next serial, he admits he was mistaken upon seeing the strong viewing figures. Meanwhile, Hartnell takes delight in his role, becoming attached to his character and the popularity it brings him with children. However, as the programme progresses, and both cast and crew change over time, Hartnell's health begins to decline. Concerned over his failure to properly remember his lines, Newman agrees to his superior's request to replace Hartnell for a new actor, Patrick Troughton (Reece Shearsmith), for the next series. With a heavy heart, Hartnell agrees to leave, but emotionally breaks down upon telling his wife the news. As Hartnell prepares for his final scene in 1966, recalling how Doctor Who began and his involvement with it, he commends Troughton for being his successor before his first scene is filmed. As filming begins, Hartnell looks to the side and sees a brief vision of Matt Smith, who will play the same role nearly 50 years later, silently acknowledge his work. The film ends on an epilogue narrative of each of the main real-life figures in the story, before closing on the real Hartnell's speech made at the end of serial, The Dalek Invasion of Earth.  Production  = Development = For the thirtieth anniversary of Doctor Who in 1993, filmmaker Kevin Davies pitched an idea called The Legend Begins to the BBC. The Legend Begins would have mixed documentary interviews with those responsible for the creation of Doctor Who with a dramatised strand showing the programme's beginnings. Eventually, the dramatisation idea was abandoned in favour of a standard documentary format looking at the entire history of Doctor Who, which was broadcast on BBC1 as Doctor Who: Thirty Years in the TARDIS in November 1993. Ten years later, for the fortieth anniversary, writer and executive producer Mark Gatiss pitched the idea for the film to BBC Four, unaware of Davies's previous attempt. However, the proposal was rejected, and Gatiss was told that there was no available slot or budget. = Writing = In order to make the film understandable to a general audience, not all personnel involved in the creation of Doctor Who are represented. For example, the role of original story editor David Whitaker is merged with that of associate producer Mervyn Pinfield; co-creator Donald Wilson and writer C.E. Webber are also excluded. Part of the production involved the recreation of scenes from the classic series, including missing episodes such as Marco Polo. Gatiss also had ambitions to recreate the death of Sara Kingdom from The Daleks' Master Plan using original actress Jean Marsh to play the increasingly aging Sara, and to use Super 8 footage of a recreation of the Radio Times publicity photo-shoot for The Three Doctors, but the budget did not accommodate these ambitions. = Filming = Principal photography for the film began in February 2013. Filming primarily took place at Wimbledon Studios in London, and the BBC Television Centre; it was the final drama to be recorded at the latter, which closed one month after filming concluded. Location filming took place on 17 February 2013, on Westminster Bridge in London. This involved replicas of 1960s Dalek props crossing the bridge, in a recreation of a famous scene from The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964). Interior scenes replicating early Doctor Who production at Lime Grove Studios were also filmed, with replicas of early television equipment being used. Cast A number of the cast have appeared in Doctor Who at one time or another, most notably original companions William Russell and Carole Ann Ford. David Bradley appeared in the Series 7 episode \\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\\", while Jessica Raine was in the Series 7 episode \\"Hide\\" and the Call the Midwife charity cross-over mini-episode; Jeff Rawle was in the Season 21 serial Frontios; Mark Eden appeared as the title character in the Season 1 serial Marco Polo; Nicholas Briggs, who has voiced the Daleks since the series was revived in 2005, portrayed his own predecessor; and Brian Cox voiced the Elder Ood in \\"The End of Time\\". Jean Marsh and Anneke Wills, who both played companions to Hartnell's First Doctor also appeared during Verity Lambert's leaving party scene. Sacha Dhawan would go on to play the Master starting with the Series 12 episode \\"Spyfall\\", while Bradley would re-don the First Doctor costume to play the part himself in the 2017 Christmas episode, \\"Twice Upon a Time\\". =Doctor Who actors= * David Bradley as William Hartnell, who portrayed the First Doctor * Jamie Glover as William Russell, who portrayed Ian Chesterton * Jemma Powell as Jacqueline Hill, who portrayed Barbara Wright * Claudia Grant as Carole Ann Ford, who portrayed Susan Foreman * Anna-Lisa Drew as Maureen O'Brien, who portrayed Vicki * Edmund C.

Along with other rolling stock, the museum houses three steam locomotives owned by the City of Portland: Southern Pacific 4449, Spokane, Portland & Seattle 700, and Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. 197, the first two of which are restored and operable. The center opened to the public on September 22, 2012. The project to establish the center was led by the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation (ORHF), a non-profit organization established in 2002. The museum site is in Southeast Portland.ORHF Home page Retrieved September 28, 2012. Background The Brooklyn Roundhouse in August 2012, just before its demolition ORHF was tasked with finding a new home for the three city-owned locomotives, after planned changes by Union Pacific Railroad (UP) made it apparent that the locomotives would need to be moved out of their longtime home in the UP's (formerly Southern Pacific's) Brooklyn Roundhouse (), a 1941-built roundhouse from Brooklyn Rail Yard in Southeast Portland's Brooklyn neighborhood. ORHF comprises several entities, including railway preservation and railfan groups as well as the city's Bureau of Parks & Recreation. Proposals to construct a new enginehouse to house the historic locomotives were expanded to encompass a visitor center and eventually an interpretive center. After considering other potential sites for an enginehouse, ORHF reached agreement in 2009 on a site near the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI), encompassing about . Construction Interior view of the new enginehouse in January 2013 with the three steam locomotives on public view Ground-breaking for the enginehouse took place in October 2011. The three steam locomotives were moved to the site from the Brooklyn Roundhouse on June 26, 2012, and were temporarily placed outdoors, awaiting completion of the enginehouse. With the house fully enclosed (though not completed), the locomotives were moved inside on July 28. Several vintage rail passenger coaches have also been moved to the site from the Brooklyn Yard (surrounding the roundhouse), where they had been outdoors, and they will continue to be kept outdoors at the new center. The budget for the initial phase of construction is $5.9 million, and funding has come mainly from donations, but with the City of Portland loaning $1 million. The Brooklyn Roundhouse was demolished in early September 2012, but its turntable was removed and placed in storage, and ORHF plans to install it at the new center in a later phase. The Oregon Rail Heritage Center opened to the public on September 22, 2012. Since its opening, it had been open for visitors Thursday through Sunday, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., with admission free, but because of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic it has been temporarily closed (indefinitely) since March 14, 2020. Collection Southern Pacific 4449 leading a 2006 excursion The centerpieces of ORHC's collection are the three steam locomotives: Southern Pacific 4449, Spokane, Portland & Seattle 700, and Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. 197. All were donated to the City of Portland in 1958 and were on static display at Oaks Amusement Park until the mid-1970s or later. No. 4449 was moved to the Burlington Northern Hoyt Street Roundhouse in 1974 for restoration and proceeded to become famous nationwide, when it hauled the American Freedom Train throughout the country during the United States Bicentennial celebrations of 1975‚Äì76. It was thereafter stored and maintained at the Brooklyn Roundhouse between excursions. SP&S; 700 moved to the roundhouse from Oaks Park in 1986, and OR&N; 197 followed in 1996. SP&S; 700 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Union Pacific diesel switcher locomotive No. 96 was added to the collection in 2016, donated to ORHF by UP. It is an SW10-class locomotive, built originally as an SW7 in 1950 by Electro-Motive Diesel (and originally numbered 1821) and rebuilt by as an SW10 by UP in 1982. It arrived at the ORHC in 2017. Several pieces of privately owned rolling stock also reside at the new center, including another diesel switcher, other locomotives and several vintage passenger and freight cars. One of the locomotives is Nickel Plate Road 190, one of two surviving ALCO PA locomotives left in the USA. Public facilities at the new enginehouse are expected to be minimal initially, consisting of a few exhibits and an area where restoration work on the locomotives and other equipment can be observed, but ORHF plans to install a full interpretive center later, on the building's second floor. The operational steam locomotives are occasionally used on excursion trips, including an annual Holiday Express, and the new enginehouse was sited and designed in such a way as to enable these trips to continue. Union Pacific Railroad's north‚Äìsouth main line runs past the building, and is connected to the Heritage Center's tracks, allowing the locomotives and other rail cars to be moved onto or off of the mainline tracks. The rail cars also have access to Oregon Pacific Railroad (OPR) tracks at the new location.

It was recorded live in Syria in 1996 at two venues: the Al Azam Palace in Damascus and one of the oldest caravanserais in Aleppo. Composed of six improvised suites, the album is a fusion of jazz and Arabic music, melding Hellborg's polyrhythms and Middle Eastern modal harmonic structures with authentic sounds of ethnic instruments played by local musicians. Darbukas (Tarek Malas and Mahfouz Al Hosaini) and riqq (Nabil Khaiat) are assisting Hellborg's acoustic bass in its rhythmic and melodic drive, joined by ney player Mased Sri al Den on the first three tracks and violinist Hadi Backdonas on the last three. The result is a collection of intriguing, though pleasantly accessible, silence-breathing arrangements with virtuous melodic exchanges, unison played ideas and haunting (at times even dance-like) rhythms. Instruments Jonas Hellborg plays here an acoustic bass, custom built by luthier Abraham Wechter, an exquisite work of art also to be heard on some of his other albums (\\"Silent Life\\", \\"Octave of the Holy Innocents\\"). In his hands, the instrument receives the versatility of a wider sounding, deeper range guitar, capable of appealing melodic runs, chordal approaches, but also of the thumb slapping, string pulling and popping one would expect from an electric bass. \\"It makes me wonder if he's not some sort of demonic half-organic machine, performing myriad calculations before lifting a finger to play not quite the thing you expected.\\" concludes Carl Glaser for Ink19 Music Reviews. Darbuka is a hand-drum heard in the Middle East, North Africa and Eastern Europe, similar to a clay pot (it can also be made of metal or wood); Riqq is a small percussion instrument similar to a tambourine used in traditional Arabic music, originally built as a wooden frame with jingles, covered with fish or goat skin; Ney is a traditional Middle-Eastern end-blown flute, with a fluid, sensual and floating sound. Title etymology \\"Aram of the Two Rivers\\" (original: \\"Aram-Naharaim\\") designates a Syrian region better known today as Mesopotamia, ancient home of the Arameans and primordial cradle of human culture and civilization, stretching between the two rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and referenced as far back as the Old Testament.

In September 1946 it was announced Nebenzal bought the rights to film the novel and had signed Maria Montez to star. The movie would be distributed through United Artists. Jay Dratler was originally signed to write the script. A number of other writers also worked on it, including an uncredited Douglas Sirk. Sirk says he was approached to direct the movie by Rudi Joseph, who had been Pabst's assistant. Sirk turned it down claiming the Pabst version was a very good film that simply should have been re-released. He was also worried the producer: > Didn't have the money to do the necessary fantastic sets. You know, Atlantis > depends on inspiring people's fantasies. The old Pabst picture had great > sets, but you do need money to construct a hidden city and that kind of > thing. It's no good trying to shoot this sort of film on a small budget, as > Nebenzal wanted ‚Äì and then he wanted me to use some of the long-shot > material from the old Pabst and so on.Sirk on Sirk by Jon Halliday, Faber & > Faber, 3 Mar 2011 p 86-87 accessed 10 February 2015 Sirk did agree to do some uncredited work on the script with Rowland Leigh but said he was \\"fairly sure I didn't do any shooting\\" on the film. It proved difficult to come up with a screenplay that satisfied the censors. In the novel, the queen had an insatiable appetite for male lovers and turns them into statues when she has finished with them. The Joseph Breen office wrote to Nebenzal complaining about the depiction of \\"hasheesh and illicit sex\\". Adjustments to the script were made. Montez's husband Jean Pierre Aumont was borrowed from MGM to appear opposite his wife. Dennis O'Keefe was then signed to support them. Filming was to start in December 1946 but was postponed because Montez needed to have an operation and was required for another film for Universal. =Shooting= The movie started filming on 17 February 1947 at a cost of $1.3 million under the direction of Arthur Ripley. Lionel Banks, who had worked on Lost Horizon, did the sets. It was shot at Samuel Goldwyn Studios. Aumont later wrote that \\"the decors were a fantastic mishmash, including naugahyde doors which seemed to have come right out of the office of the frenetic producer rather than the mysterious palace of Antinea.\\" He also says the filmmakers made him wear three inch heels so he was taller than Dennis O'Keefe, who was two inches taller than Aumont. Montez said during filming that she hoped to give a good performance along with the \\"sex and stuff people expect of me... Not that I have anything against glamor. But I would like a role I could get my teeth into. After all, I have two years typing to overcome, of going from one to another until I was groggy. And it is the hardest thing to do that sort of vamp ‚Äì like Theda Bara ‚Äì and not be laughable.\\" Aumont recalls that dromedaries were imported from a neighbouring zoo. However camels were needed so a second hump was attached to them using rubber cement. A leopard who acted in the film was dosed up with tranquilisers and sent to live with Aumont and Montez for a few days to become accustomed to them. After filming wrapped both Aumont and Montez signed three year contracts with the producer to make one movie a year. \\"It is a picture of which I am very proud\\", said Montez. Aumont wrote that the film \\"for some mysterious reason, didn't fare too badly.\\" =Reshoots= Test screenings in Las Vegas went poorly and the producer became convinced that audiences did not understand the Pierre Benoit story because it was \\"too philosophical\\". Douglas Sirk saw the movie and thought that \\"for various reasons not to do with Ripley, but mainly with the cast, it did not come off.\\" Sirk was asked to salvage the movie \\"but I didn't want to have anything to do with it anymore.\\" Nebenzal managed to raise an estimated further $250,000 in funds for reshoots done over two weeks in July with John Brahm directing. Morris Carnovsky's role was reduced since he was not available and his character was replaced with a new one played by Henry Daniell. Maria Montez and Aumont returned and \\"violence and movement\\" was introduced, according to the producer. Neither Ripley nor Brahm were willing to take credit for the final version so the editor Gregg G. Tallas, who put together the two versions, was credited as director. Choreography in the movie was done by Lester Horton. Reception The film had trouble securing distribution in the US, requiring re-editing. However it has now come to be appreciated as a camp classic. It was also known as Atlantis. =Box office= The movie performed poorly at the box office and was described as \\"a calamity from a financial standpoint.\\" The producer later revealed at a trial (see below) that the film needed to gross $3.5 million to break even and as at 1950 had only grossed $335,000. However it did perform respectably in France with admissions of 2,188,732.French box office for 1949 at Box Office Story =Critical reception= Thework=Los Angeles Times said the film \\"does have its moments of action and violence but too much of it is given over to the philosophical introspection (or thinking aloud) of the characters.\\" Lawsuit In October 1948 Montez sued Nebenzal for $38,000. She claimed under her contract on 2 October 1946 she was to be paid $100,000, half during filming and the rest within nine months. Although the film finished 12 June 1947, Montez said she had only received $62,000. The matter went to trial in 1950 and Montez had to fly back to the US from Europe to give evidence. Judgement was returned in Montez's favor and it was ruled she was entitled to the whole amount.

A successful implementation of the sprinkler strategy requires a high standardization of marketing activities due to the extreme difficulty implied in the simultaneous maximization of marketing activities' customization and of the number of successful market entries. Usually, a certain amount of failed market entries and withdrawals from some markets is accepted if a sprinkler strategy is used. In case a waterfall strategy and a sprinkler strategy are used together, this yields a combined waterfall-sprinkler-strategy.Schmid, S. (2006): Internationales Management, 5th ed., M√ºnchen-Wien-Oldenbourg.  Advantages and disadvantages of the sprinkler strategy Advantages of the sprinkler strategy are: * Once a market is successfully entered, its market entry barriers work against potential followers (first-mover advantages). * The risk associated with multiple simultaneous market entry attempts is distributed regionally (risk diversification). * Entering multiple markets simultaneously is likely to result in a high volume of sales which is beneficial with respect to capacity utilization. * By achieving market entry in multiple markets the company makes full use of its competitive advantage. * Multiple simultaneous market entries in foreign markets allow for a more rapid development of international markets. Disadvantages of the sprinkler strategy are: * A successful implementation of the sprinkler strategy incurs a high need for many financial and personnel resources in a very short time frame. * If too many market entries are unsuccessful and the strategy fails, major losses to the company are highly probable. * There is less or no opportunity to learn from earlier market entries and apply the lessons learned when making later market entries.

It is 1840 and California is ruled by the Mexican government. Kent is transporting rifles from Mexico City to California to be used by soldiers there. The women hide and ride with Kent's caravan to Santa Barbara. Although she is wealthy and can pay, Kent says he will forego any remuneration from Marguerita in exchange for the first dance at a festival. As love blossoms, they continue north to Monterey with the caravan, where Kent is reunited with an old friend, Lt. Carlos Ortega, only to learn that Ortega is engaged to be married to Marguerita. An attack by Spanish royalists leaves Ortega seriously injured. Manuel De Roja is taken prisoner by Kent and turned over to one of Ortega's men, but the officer in charge turns out to be Manuel's own brother, Major De Roja. Now in love, Marguerita and Kent try to leave Monterey together but are captured by De Roja's men. A jealous Ortega searches and is also taken captive, but after an escape, Kent kills De Roja in a battle with swords.

A descendant of courtesans, she was also a patron of the arts and a historian. Nagarathnamma built a temple over the samadhi of the Carnatic singer Tyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru and helped establish the Tyagaraja Aradhana festival in his memory. Within a male dominated festival, she was the feminist aggressive enough to ensure that women artists were given equality to participate in it. She \\"was among the last practitioners of the devadasi tradition in India,\\" and the first president of the Association of the Devadasis of Madras Presidency. She also edited and published books on poetry and anthologies. Early life Nagarathnamma was born in 1878 to Puttu Lakshmi and Vakil Subba Rao, in Nanjangud. Puttu Lakshmi's ancestors served as singers and musicians in the court of Mysore. Abandoned by Subba Rao, she found refuge under Shastri, a Sanskrit scholar in the court of the Mysore Maharaja. He educated Nagarathnamma in Sanskrit and music, and she was initiated in devadasi at the age of five. However, Shastri also abandoned Nagarathnamma who soon left Mysore and found protection under her uncle, Venkitaswamy Appa, a violinist by profession. Nagarthnamma continued her studies and learned Kannada, English and Telugu, also becoming proficient in music and dance. She was trained in Carnatic music by Munuswamappa in the 'shishya-parampara' (tradition of the student teacher learning process), on the process set by Thyagaraja. She was able to make her first stage appearance before a learned audience as a violinist and dancer at the age of 15. Career Mukunda Mala stotra by Bengaluru Nagaratnamma Nagarathnamma became a singer early in her life and emerged as one of the best Carnatic singers of her time. She sang in Kannada, Sanskrit and Telugu. Her special musical forte included Harikatha. Her talent in dance attracted the attention of the Mysore ruler Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar who, impressed with her talent, made her the Asthana Vidushi (court dancer) in Mysore. Following the death of the ruler, she moved to Bangalore. She attained popularity in Bangalore not only in music but also in dance. She was also patronized by many other royal houses such as those of Travancore, Bobbili, and Vijayanagaram. Narahari Rao, a judge in the High Court of Mysore, was one of Nagarathnamma's patrons and he suggested to her to move to Madras (now known as Chennai) to further her career as a musician and dancer. She shifted to there as it was considered the \\"Mecca of Carnatic music\\" and her musical talent was further developed. Here, she specifically identified herself as Bangalore Nagarathnamma. The patronage she received from Justice Narahari Rao made her famous as a \\"concert artist\\" in Madras. As promoter of Tyagaraja Aradhana, she was the \\"first female artist to pay income tax\\" in Madras, India. Thyagaraja memorial and Aradhana Marble notice board at ashram of singer Tyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru According to Nagarathnamma, she was directed in a dream to build a memorial in honour of Thyagaraja and create a platform for perpetuating Carnatic music. Following this, she turned to an ascetic way of life and donated all her earnings to this cause. While in Madras, Nagarathnamma was informed by her guru, Bidaram Krishnappa, of the dilapidated status of the samadhi or tomb of saint Thyagaraja. Bidaram Krishnappa's disciples, Krishna Bhagavatar and Sundara Bhagavatar, had erected a small edifice made of marble in 1903 and held annual music festivals in honour of Thyagaraja thereafter. Within a few years, a feud had erupted among people interested in honouring the saint, and two rival groups were holding two rival concerts at the saint's samadhi. Upkeep of the tiny edifice had suffered and it had quickly fallen into dilapidation. This prompted Nagarathnamma to take steps to restore the samadhi and convert it into a memorial in honour of the Thyagaraja. She acquired the land where Thyagaraja's samadhi was located and built a larger edifice embodying a temple in his honour with her own financial resources. She arranged for an idol of sri Thyagaraja to be installed and consecrated by Brahmin priests and for prayers to be offered daily. The Thyagaraja Temple thus constructed was consecrated in 1921. At that time, the music festival held at this location was male-dominated for the simple reason that in thosen days, decent woman would never sing or dance, and these skills were strictly the preserve of the courtesan and the devadasi, the two types of divine artists found in south India at that time. The idea of one or more female artist singing and participating in the annual functions of the shrine was anathema to society, and the rival performing groups therefore prevented Nagarathnamma from participating in the festival, even though she had paid for the renovation and she said that she would not sing or dance like a courtesan, but would only recite Harikatha in front of the deity. Nevertheless, she was refused. She took this as a challenge and started organizing a parallel music festival at the back of the saint's temple. Her group was named \\"Pengal Katchi\\" (women's group), and the Aradhana organized by her was held concurrently with the one organized by the male centric groups of the music festival, known as the \\"Periya Katchi\\" or \\"major group\\". Eventually, in 1941, her activism paid off, and the opposing groups involved with the festival merged into a single entity, allowing both men and women to sing in the festival. This music festival has become renowned as one of the most popular musical event in South India. This tradition of women musicians' participation at the annual festival, known popularly as the \\"Thyagaraja Aradhana\\", along with male musicians, has continued over the years. In 1927, Nagarathnamma and other devadasis established the Association of the Devadasis of Madras Presidency; she was elected its first president. Literary pursuits As an erudite and scholarly person, Nagarathnamma dabbled in editing and publishing books on poetry and anthologies. She was a linguist who held religious discourses not only in Kannada, her mother tongue, but also in other languages such as Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit. During her foray into literature, she came across an old poem called the Radhika Santawanam (Appeasing Radhika), which she found inadequately covered vis-a-vis the original version written by Muddupalani, a courtesan herself, in Telugu verses. This was a book which Paidipati Venkatanarasu had edited based on the ready to print version, which Charles Phillip Brown, an eminent scholar in Telugu, had prepared and deposited in the Oriental Manuscripts Library in 1855. However, Venkatanarasu, an associate of Brown, had printed an annotated version in 1887 (reprinted in 1907), but had deliberately dropped a few erotic verses and also the prologue from the original version as he had considered them inappropriate to the then prevailing social norms. The prologue which he had deleted was related to the devadasi tradition that had been adopted by Nagarathnamma's mother and grandmother. This exclusion was particularly disliked by Nagarthnamma and she made efforts to get the original version written on palm leaves. Once she found the original version, she reedited the Radhika Santawanam, which fully conformed to the palm leaf manuscript version. In 1910, she published this book with a preface in which she noted that she had read and reread the poetic verses of the book several times for its aesthetic quality. The book, published 150 years after the original manuscript was written by Muddupalani in Telugu, was reviewed by Kandukuri Veeresalingam, who, though a supporter of women's causes, attacked some of the erotic contents of the book as totally \\"inappropriate for women to hear let alone be uttered from a woman's mouth.\\" Nagarathnamma strongly defended her version of the book and counterattacked saying that there was very much more titillating content included in the book titled Vaijayantivilasam, which the critic (Veeresalingam) had reviewed and accepted for printing. She protested against this double standard and wondered \\"Does the question of propriety and embarrassment apply only in the case of women and not men\\". Muddupalani's Radhika Santawanam, edited by Nagarathnamma, was published but received criticism, with one Telugu magazine even noting that \\"a prostitute had composed the book and another prostitute had edited it.\\" Following the adverse reaction to the book, it was banned. However, with the intervention by Raja Venkatagiri the issue was \\"soft-pedaled\\". It was alleged that it was a vindictive action by the Veerasilingham lobby, as books with much more suggestive content had been published. However, after India attained independence the ban on the book was lifted by Tanguturi Prakasam, the then Chief Minister of Madras, with a comment that \\"he was restoring a few pearls to the necklace of Telugu literature\\". Death Nagarathnamma died in 1952 at the age of 74; a memorial in her honour was erected next to Thyagaraja's samadhi.

James Hogan was signed to write and direct Zorya which became Gypsy Girl then Gypsy Wildcat. He fell ill so he was replaced by Roy William Neill. James M Cain was hired to work on the dialogue.

Maria Montez has a small role.Lucy Devils at Mariamontez.org Plot summary A sly pair of newsreel reporters, Dick McManus (Richard Arlen) and Andy Tompkins (Andy Devine), who work for the Mercury News Reel Company, has made a profession of photographing stories featuring daredevil acts by ordinary people. One of the exciting places for doing these acts is the Phillips Dam and it's often visible in the two reporters' photos. This fact is used by two foreign saboteurs, R. W. Ritter (Ralf Harolde) and Berko (Dick Terry). The saboteurs are planning to destroy the dam and have great help from the reporters' footage. At the same time, reporters Dick and Andy are informed by their editor, K. W. Momsen (Tim Ryan), at the Mercury News Reel Company offices, that they may be held responsible if anything does happen to the dam. Norma Bishop (Dorothy Lovett) is a teletypist for the Consolidated News Service and also Dick's go-to girlfriend. She finds out that Dick has used inside information in her possession once again, to photograph the dam. She is upset by this and worries that she may lose her job if word gets out. Dick and Andy are sent by their editor to photograph the maiden flight of a new and technically groundbreaking robotics airplane, but Dick accidentally sabotages its first voyage when he sneaks aboard the plane and knocks out its radar. After being bailed out of jail, Dick and Andy are told that their recently awarded $1,000 bonus is going toward the plane's repair. Dick pays a visit to Norma's office, to say hello and perhaps pick up some leads at the same time. During his sneak visit, he finds out that the Duke and Duchess of Vere are arriving incognito by boat to the city. To get an exclusive on the coverage, Dick tricks Norma into leaving her desk, and then he sends out a fake news item that quintuplet colts have been born at a nearby farm. The result is that all the other newsreel reporters go to cover the fake story at the farm, and Dick and Andy cover the royal couple's arrival alone. At the pier, Dick and Andy get involved in the news story by fending off an attempt to assassinate the royal couple and the subsequently become heroes. The two reporters enjoy their success, but the news of their heroics gets out and the fake story sent out from Norma's desk gets her fired. Hoping to get even, Norma sends Dick and Andy out on a fake story of her own, about an airplane pilot. As luck would have it, the two reporters make the news anyway, when they rescue the pilot Gordon Douglas after his plane crashes during an around-the-world flight. Despite her attempt to get even, Dick feels sorry for Norma and manages to get her a new job as a radio announcer. Saboteurs Ritter and Berko go to the Mercury offices and offer to buy the Phillips Dam footage, but are turned down by the editor. Dick and Andy are out taking live photos and come across a mining disaster where another newsreel reporter has been murdered. After photographing the murder story, Dick and Andy are almost killed themselves by Ritter and Berko when the spies are caught stealing the dam footage. The spies get away though. Dick and Andy find out that F.B.I. agent Chandler is put to investigate a sabotage attempt on the dam. In a desperate attempt to stop the saboteurs from blowing up the dam Dick calls on Norma, who fakes a radio broadcast that the dam has already been blown up. Dick rushes to the dam, while Andy goes to a museum to photograph its model. Having been told that no photos are allowed, Andy instead steals the model by pretending to be a repairman. As Dick learns that the dam is still intact, Andy accidentally blows up the model while photographing it. That footage is then mistakenly sent to the theaters as \\"exclusive\\" footage of the real dam's sabotage. Because of this Dick becomes the laughing stock of the news world. He returns to the radio station, claiming to have footage of the real saboteurs planting explosives at the dam. Bradford (Jack Arnold), who is Dick's newsreel rival, hires the private detective Aloysius K. Grimshaw (Gus Schilling) to follow Dick on his next story. While driving to Andy's farm, Dick realizes he is being followed, and he and Andy scare off Grimshaw by projecting footage of man-eating lions. Ritter and Berko, pretends to be FBI agents, and pay a visit to Norma at the radio station to learn Dick and Andy's whereabouts. Not seeing through the disguises Norma tells them about Andy's farm, and the fake agents insist she take them there. Back at the Mercury offices, Momsen is being bombarded with returned newsreels of the fake dam blow-up from angry agencies. Since Dock and Andy have gone underground at Andy's farm, both Chandler and Gwendy Wimple (Janet Shaw) - Andy's clueless airhead of a girl friend - seek Andy. Chandler wants him for the theft of the museum dam model, and Gwendy for breaking his promise to her. Bradford and Grimshaw returns from their horrible experience at the farm, and tells all about the lions. Soon the entire group heads for the farm. Norma and the two fake agents/saboteurs arrive at the farm, only to learn from Dick that there is no real sabotage footage. Inside the barn, a fight breaks out, and Andy attacks the saboteurs by using model airplanes launched from the hay-loft. The saboteurs are taken care of before the rest of the ensemble arrives, and Ritter and Berko are arrested on the spot by the real agents. Back at the newsreel offices, Norma arrives, having been fired from her broadcasting job. As Andy and Gwendy watch, Dick offers to take Norma \\"off the air for life\\" with a marriage proposal.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/82140/Lucky-Devils/ Cast *Richard Arlen as Dick McManus *Andy Devine as Andy Tompkins *Janet Shaw as Gwendy Whimple *Jack Arnold as Bradford *Ralf Harolde as R.W.

The story was adapted from the short story \\"The Mystery of Marie Rog√™t\\" written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1842. The film, directed by Phil Rosen and produced by Universal Pictures, is set in 1889. Plot In 1889 Paris, musical comedy star Marie Roget has been missing for ten days. Police inspector Gobelin is investigating. The French Minister for Naval Affairs, Henri Beauvais, is a friend of Marie's grandmother, Madame Cecile Roget, and younger sister Camille. He threatens to take Gobelin off the case so he brings in medical officer Dr. Paul Dupin. The body of a dead woman is found in the river. Although the face is mutilated, Beauvais believes it is Marie. Then Marie returns but refuses to say where she has been. Camille becomes engaged to Marcel Vigneauz. Marcel and Marie are lovers and planning to murder Camille, who is set to inherit a fortune. Cecile Roget asks Dupin to escort Camille to a party as she fears her granddaughter will be murdered there. At the party, Beauvais propositions Marie, telling her that he knows of her affair with Marcel. Marcel hesitates to kill Camille, causing an argument between him and Marie. Marie disappears. The body of another faceless woman is found. Dupin sneaks into the morgue to remove the brain from the second woman's body, and identifies it as Marie. Cecile tells Camille about Marie's plan to kill her. Marcel confesses to killing Marie, but says he did so to save Camille. Beauvais demands the charges against Marcel be dropped and Dupin agrees. Marcel challenges Dupin to a duel. Gobelin learns from Scotland Yard that the first dead body was that of Marcel's English wife, who had recently come to Paris to find her husband. Dupin and Gobelin discover Beauvais and Marcel have gone missing. Dupin reveals he accused Camille of having Marie's diary, even though he knew the diary didn't exist, so the murderer would retrieve it. They arrive at the Roget home just as Marcel was going to kill Camille. Gobeblin shoots Marcel dead. Gobelin discovers that Beauvais has been secretly helping Dupin.

LOHAFEX was an ocean iron fertilization experiment jointly planned by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in India and the Helmholtz Foundation in Germany. The purpose of the experiment was to see if the iron would cause an algal bloom and trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The experiment followed a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 30 October 2007 by Dr. T. Ramaswami, Director General, CSIR, and Dr. Juergen Mlynek, President, Helmholtz Foundation, Germany, on Cooperation in Marine Sciences, during the visit of the German Chancellor, Frau Angela Merkel to India. The experiment was conducted mainly by CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, and Alfred-Wegener Institute (AWI) of Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, with participation of scientists from Chile, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. The German research vessel, Polarstern, was utilized for the experiment on her ANT XXV/3 cruise. It was jointly led by Wajih Naqvi of CSIR-NIO and Victor Smetacek of AWI. Weekly reports of the expedition were published on the website of AWI. A cyclonic eddy centered on 48 deg S, 16 deg E was selected for fertilization. The experiment began on India's Republic Day (26 January 2009). Ten tonnes of ferrous sulphate dissolved in seawater was spread over an area of 300 square kilometers, and the patch created was monitored for 38 days to investigate the effects of iron addition on marine biogeochemistry and ecosystem. Another iron addition of similar magnitude was done two weeks later. It was expected that iron addition would trigger algal bloom leading to sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The ship left Cape Town on 7 January 2009. The expedition ended after 70 days on 17 March 2009 in Punta Arenas, Chile. Following protests from several NGOs, the German government ordered a halt of the experiment. Environmentalists feared damage to the marine ecosystem from an artificial algal bloom. The critics argued that long-term effects of ocean fertilization would not be detectable during short-term observation. Other critics feared the entry into large-scale manipulation of ecosystems with these large geo- engineering experiments. The German government sent the proposal for scientific and legal reviews that were supportive of the project and the experiment was allowed to continue. LOHAFEX was not the first experiment of its kind. In 2000 and 2004, comparable amounts of iron sulfate were discharged from the same ship (EisenEx experiment). 10 to 20 percent of the algal bloom died off and sank to the sea floor. This removed carbon from the atmosphere, which is the intended carbon sink. As expected iron fertilization led to development of a bloom during LOHAFEX, but the chlorophyll increase within the fertilized patch, an indicator of biomass, was smaller than in previous experiments. The algal bloom also stimulated the growth of zooplankton that feed on them. The zooplankton in turn are consumed by higher organisms. Thus, ocean fertilization with iron also contributes to the carbon-fixing marine biomass of fish species which have been removed from the ocean by over- fishing. In contrast to the other experiments (e.g. EisenEX) the uptake of the algae by zooplankton left no relevant organic carbon to sink to the ocean floor. Thus, the applied iron did not contribute to the sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Cast *Jean-Pierre Aumont *Maria Montez *Lilli Palmer Production Aumont served with the Free French Army during World War II and was wounded by shrapnel near Marseilles in 1944. While recuperating he read the novel Hans Le Marin by Edouard Peysson and began to think about filming it on location near Marseilles. In 1946 Aumont visited the author with his brother Fran√ßois Villiers and his wife Maria Montez, and negotiated to buy the film rights. Aumont was to write the script, Villiers was to direct and Montez and Aumont would star. The goal was to show Montez \\"is an actress as well as a manikin\\". Andre Sarrut of Safia Productions agreed to pay the production costs of the film up to 80,000 francs (then US$250,000). Aumont was to produce through his company with Montez, Christina Productions. Christina provided the services of Aumont, Montez and Lilli Palmer; in exchange Christina's share would be paid off first out of US receipts. Filming began in Marseilles in July 1948.

IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system ‚Äì including all hardware, software and peripheral equipment ‚Äì operated by a limited group of users. Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC, but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that \\"the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT).\\" Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making, and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs. The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment, and e-commerce. Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000 BC ‚Äì 1450 AD), mechanical (1450‚Äì1840), electromechanical (1840‚Äì1940), and electronic (1940‚Äìpresent). This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic). History of computer technology Zuse Z3 replica on display at Deutsches Museum in Munich. The Zuse Z3 is the first programmable computer. Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick. The Antikythera mechanism, dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer, and the earliest known geared mechanism. Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed. Electronic computers, using either relays or valves, began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed during the Second World War to decrypt German messages, was the first electronic digital computer. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring. The first recognisably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Baby, which ran its first program on 21 June 1948. The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I, contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison, the first transistorized computer developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version. Several later breakthroughs in semiconductor technology include the integrated circuit (IC) invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Laboratories in 1959, and the microprocessor invented by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971. These important inventions led to the development of the personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, and the emergence of information and communications technology (ICT). Electronic data processing =Data storage= Punched tapes were used in early computers to represent data. Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape, a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete. Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line. The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube, based on a standard cathode ray tube, but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum, invented in 1932 and used in the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer. IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system. Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs. Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices, but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007 almost 94% of the data stored worldwide was held digitally: 52% on hard disks, 28% on optical devices and 11% on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007, doubling roughly every 3 years. Databases Database Management Systems (DMS) emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. An early such systems was IBM's Information Management System (IMS), which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later. IMS stores data hierarchically, but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. In 1981, the first commercially available relational database management system (RDBMS) was released by Oracle. All DMS consist of components, they allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity. All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema. In recent years, the extensible markup language (XML) has become a popular format for data representation. Although XML data can be stored in normal file systems, it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their \\"robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort\\". As an evolution of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable. =Data retrieval= The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured Query Language (SQL), based on relational algebra. The terms \\"data\\" and \\"information\\" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully. Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats even within a single organization. Data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems (DSS). =Data transmission= Data transmission has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception. It can be broadly categorized as broadcasting, in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or telecommunications, with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels. XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s, particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented protocols such as SOAP, describing \\"data-in-transit rather than ... data-at-rest\\". =Data manipulation= Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of Moore's law): machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years. Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: \\"data archives that are seldom visited\\". To address that issue, the field of data mining ‚Äì \\"the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data\\" ‚Äì emerged in the late 1980s. Perspectives =Academic perspective= In an academic context, the Association for Computing Machinery defines IT as \\"undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of organizations .... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organization‚Äôs computer users.\\"The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005.Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf) =Commercial and employment perspective= Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the \\"tech sector\\" or the \\"tech industry\\". Many companies now have IT departments for managing the computers, networks, and other technical areas of their businesses. In a business context, the Information Technology Association of America has defined information technology as \\"the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems\\". The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded and replaced.

He is also known as the former lead singer of progressive rock band Glass Hammer from 2009 to 2014, and the former bass guitarist of Sky Cries Mary from 1993 to 2016, in which he was credited under his nickname of \\"Juano\\" Davison. He has, since childhood, been a friend of Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins. Career =Early years= Davison's earliest involvement with music began when he sang in the church youth choir led by his mother. From an early age, she instilled in him an appreciation for music and love for singing. Soon after he took up guitar and bass, which eventually led him during High School to perform in various original and cover bands with his childhood best friend, Taylor Hawkins (currently the drummer for Foo Fighters). It was Hawkins who gave Jon the nickname \\"Juano\\" that has stuck to this day. =Sky Cries Mary= Davison then attended the Art Institute of Seattle to study audio and video production where he landed the gig of bassist for Northwest group Sky Cries Mary. Throughout the 1990s, he continued recording and touring with the band. Some highlights of this period were traveling to Japan, and appearing on late night talk shows including Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Daily Show. In 2001, Davison and his then wife moved for a year to Maewe's home of Brazil. While living there, Davison played bass with Ronald Augusto. In November 26, 2016, Sky Cries Mary premiered a new line-up, of which Davison was not a part. =Glass Hammer= Davison remained a member of Sky Cries Mary, but also joined the now-disbanded Yes tribute band Roundabout. In 2009, Glass Hammer discovered Davison singing Yes music online and asked him to join the band as \\"the voice we were always writing music for\\", according to founding members Steve Babb and Fred Schendel. He has since recorded five albums with them, If, Cor Cordium, Perilous, a new version of The Inconsolable Secret and Ode to Echo. He was the lead vocalist on the first three, and sharing that role on Ode to Echo given his engagements with Yes; he subsequently left the band to focus on Yes. On the 2018 Cruise to the Edge festival, Davison performed live with Glass Hammer as a guest; as Glass Hammer was mainly a studio project when he was a member, it marked the first time he performed with them live. =Yes= In February 2012, Davison was announced as the new lead singer of Yes, replacing Beno√Æt David, who left the group because of illness. \\"Strangely enough, Jon's name came up when we started working with Benoit,\\" Yes bassist Chris Squire recalled. \\"In fact, my friend, Taylor Hawkins, had been telling me for years: 'If you ever need a replacement (singer), I know exactly the guy.'\\" Davison has described how the band had a tour booked when David dropped out, \\"so there was sort of this frantic race to resolve this matter [...] because they weren't going to back out of the tour. So in the same moment, perhaps even the same hour, of the same day, Chris is calling Taylor to get my phone number, because he's gonna give me a call, and then the manager is also working on contacting me, so I got contacted by both of them.\\" Davison has toured with Yes since joining the band, and sang lead on 2014's Heaven & Earth. He wrote or co-wrote seven out of the eight tracks. In July 2020, Davison said the band were at work writing their next album, stating that it was still in the early stages of compiling demos, but the band has half an album of material ready.https://www.podbean.com/media/share/pb- edfdt-e462f3?utm_campaign=a_share_ep&utm;_medium=dlink&utm;_source=a_shareE6: Jon Davison - Interview Sessions With The Singer For Legendary Prog/Rock Band - Yes = Other = In 2015, Davison appeared at a Foo Fighters concert, and joined his childhood friend Taylor Hawkins, to perform the Rush song \\"Tom Sawyer\\" with them. In August 2019, Davison joined the Foo Fighters in concert in Dublin, Ireland to sing Queen song \\"Under Pressure\\" with Taylor Hawkins while Dave Grohl took over on drums.

The film features Maria Montez in an early role. Turhan Bey also appears. The film was based on the exploits of oceanic flyers, flying for Pan American World Airways. Plot Foreign correspondent Jim Montgomery (William Gargan) agrees to quit his job when his fianc√©e Frankie (Irene Hervey) threatens to return home to San Francisco without him, tired of his profession always coming first. He remains in Bombay, India for one more assignment, investigating a report of missing jewels, valued at four million dollars. A mysterious man called Chundra (Turhan Bey) continues to observe him. With the case still unsolved, Jim and Frankie board a flying boat to Manila, unaware that the gems are aboard. A passenger is mysteriously killed, but not before the jewels are hidden in Frankie's case. George Lewis (Lloyd Corrigan), another passenger, admits to being a courier for the diamonds, saying they are meant to be a gift to a foreign dignitary. Lewis, too, is then killed. Montgomery encounters the culprit and is in danger of being thrown from the aircraft, but he is rescued by Chundra, who is actually a government agent. Frankie can not blame Jim this time for being in a hurry to get back to work and report the story.

History The school opened with 23 pupils with lessons being held in the Rathaus, and later in the Catholic Pfarrhaus in the Brunnenstra√üe and the former Vollmannschen Lateinschule on the corner of Klosterwall and Neustra√üe. In 1859, it moved into its own building in Friedrichstra√üe, and in 1897 to the new building in Schwertstra√üe. In 1899, it changed to being a gymnasium, and in 1902, it had pupils completing the abitur for the first time. From 1918 to 1924, the school building was used to accommodate a Scottish regiment, and lessons were held in the local court and in a vocational school. In 1930, 28 pupils from the school and from the Junior Technical School in Chatham each visited the other school. This is claimed to be the oldest proven instance of schools in Germany and England having a student exchange. In 1935, the school was renamed Moeller- van-den-Bruck-Schule. From 1943 to 1945, lessons were held in Salzungen und in Goethe-Schule in Ilmenau. The school building was destroyed in air strikes on 4 and 5 November 1944. From 4 October 1945, lessons were held in a shift system in Schule Zweigstra√üe an in nearby grammar school August-Dicke-Schule. A World War II Hochbunker still stands on Gymnasium Schwerstrasse's school grounds today. It was built on the same spot on which the Solingen Synagogue Malteserstrasse used to stand until it was destroyed during the Night of Broken Glass on 9‚Äì10 November 1938. In January 1946, the school was renamed Gymnasium Schwertstra√üe. On 27 October 1952, the school moved into the rebuilt site in Schwertstra√üe. In 1971, the school became co-educational by accepting girls for the first time. Until this day, Schwerstrasse students are responsible for projects regarding the Old Synagogue as well as the upkeep of Solingen's old Jewish cemetery. Next to the boys' school exchange with Chatham Grammar School for Boys, Gymnasium Schwertstrasse also established a girls' student exchange with Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls. Gymnasium Schwertstrasse also has a French exchange programme with the Lyc√©e Mathias in Solingen's sister city Chalon sur Sa√¥ne. Bilingual Studies In 1997 it became the first secondary school in Solingen to establish a bilingual \\"Anglo- German\\" stream. Two out of the four or five new classes every year are bilingual. Students enrolled in the bilingual stream have more English lessons per week. In Years 5 and 6, they have 7 English lessons per week instead of the regular 5. These extra lessons are used for creative projects like rewriting and performing sketches. From Year 7 onwards, Geography, History and Politics are taught primarily in English, using English study materials and text books. In Year 7, bilingual students also spend a 1-week class trip in England. At first, students stayed in host families in Canterbury, but this was later changed to Eastbourne. Bilingual students who want to study in German can switch to a regular class and forfeit their bilingual status. However, regular students who'd like to switch to bilingual can't do so due to the vocabulary discrepancy in History, Geography and Politics. Students who choose to stay bilingual until they graduate with their Abitur need to take Advanced courses in English bili as well as advanced or intermediate courses in either History bili or Geography bili up until final exams. Students who graduate from bilingual classes receive an Additional Certificate of Anglo- German bilingual studies with their Abitur. Those first two bilingual classes from 1997 gained their Abitur in 2006.

In Kendall's notation it describes a system where arrivals are governed by a Poisson process, there are infinitely many servers, so jobs do not need to wait for a server. Each job has an exponentially distributed service time. It is a limit of the M/M/c queue model where the number of servers c becomes very large. The model can be used to model bound lazy deletion performance. Model definition An M/M/‚àû queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0,1,2,3,...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers currently being served. Since, the number of servers in parallel is infinite, there is no queue and the number of customers in the systems coincides with the number of customers being served at any moment. * Arrivals occur at rate Œª according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i + 1\\\\. * Service times have an exponential distribution with parameter Œº and there are always sufficient servers such that every arriving job is served immediately. Transitions from state i to i ‚àí 1 are at rate iŒº The model has transition rate matrix :Q=\\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda  \\\\mu & -(\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda  &2\\\\mu & -(2\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda  &&3\\\\mu & -(3\\\\mu+\\\\lambda) & \\\\lambda  &&&&\\\\ddots \\\\end{pmatrix}. The state space diagram for this chain is as below. File:Mminfinity-statespace.svg Transient solution Assuming the system starts in state 0 at time 0, then the probability the system is in state j at time t can be written as ::p_{0j}(t) = \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu}(1-e^{-\\\\mu t}) \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu}(1-e^{-\\\\mu t})\\\\right)^j}{j!} \\\\text{ for } j \\\\geq 0 from which the mean queue length at time t can be computed (writing N(t) for the number of customers in the system at time t given the system is empty at time zero) ::\\\\mathbb E(N(t)  N(0)=0) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu} (1-e^{-\\\\mu t}) \\\\text{ for } t \\\\geq 0. =Response time= The response time for each arriving job is a single exponential distribution with parameter Œº. The average response time is therefore 1/Œº. =Maximum number of customers in the system= Given the system is in equilibrium at time 0, we can compute the cumulative distribution function of the process maximum over a finite time horizon T in terms of Charlier polynomials. =Congestion period= The congestion period is the length of time the process spends above a fixed level c, starting timing from the instant the process transitions to state c + 1\\\\. This period has mean value ::\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\sum_{i>c} \\\\frac{c!}{i!}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu} \\\\right)^{i-c} and the Laplace transform can be expressed in terms of Kummer's function. Stationary analysis The stationary probability mass function is a Poisson distribution :: \\\\pi_k = \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda/\\\\mu)^k e^{-\\\\lambda/\\\\mu}}{k!} \\\\quad k \\\\geq 0 so the mean number of jobs in the system is Œª/Œº.

Here the individual sheaves have been put together into a stook (\\"stooked\\") to dry. A sheaf of grain on a plaque Sheafing machine A sheaf (/ ÉiÀêf/) is a bunch of cereal-crop stems bound together after reaping, traditionally by sickle, later by scythe or, after its introduction in 1872, by mechanical reaper-binder Traditional hand-reapers, using scythes and working as a team, cut a field of grain clockwise, starting from an outside edge and finishing in the middle. Scything leaves a windrow of cut stems to the left of the reaper and, if cut skillfully, leaves the seed heads more or less aligned. These are then picked up and tied into sheaves by the sheavers, who traditionally use other cut stems as ties. These sheavers, or a following team, then stand the sheaves up in stooks to dry. Three to eight sheaves make up each stook, which forms a self-supporting A-frame with the grain-heads meeting at the top. This keeps the grain well ventilated, and off the ground allowing it to dry and discouraging vermin. The drying sheaves are later either placed by hand or pitched onto a cart. The traditional sheaf pitchfork has a long wooden handle, two short tynes and a rounded back to make the placing of sheaves easy. The gathered sheaves are then either built into stacks (thatched stacks could be over 20' highHaystacks (Monet series)) or taken to a barn for further drying before being threshed to separate the grain from the stems. The mechanisation of agriculture in industrialised countries, in particular the introduction of the combine harvester from the middle of the 19th century, has made the sheaf redundant, but sheaves remain in widespread use wherever harvesting is still done by hand or by reaper-binder.

So far, very few specimens have been found, all female. They exhibit extensive black markings on the basal portion of both wings, which differentiates them from the 14 other species in the genus Semachrysa. The species was discovered when a Malaysian amateur photographer posted a picture of it to the online photo-sharing site Flickr. A California state entomologist saw it and was unable to identify the species; nor were any colleagues he shared the image with. Eventually, he contacted the photographer and was able to obtain a specimen. Further testing at the Natural History Museum in London confirmed that it was indeed a new species. Its discovery has been described as a triumph of citizen science. The species was listed among the Top 10 New Species 2013 discovered in 2012 as selected by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University out of more than 140 nominated species. Its distinctiveness is its resemblance to a poisonous snake and its presence in an area of anthropogenic exploitation. The selection was publicised on 22 May 2013. Description S. jade's usual coloration is yellow to pale green. It has forewings long and hindwings long. Its antennae have approximately 50 flagellomeres. Like all other species in its genus it is distinguished by its veined wings, and the dark markings in the center. It most resembles Semachrysa wallacei. Discovery In May of 2011, Hock Ping Guek, a Malaysian photographer was hiking in Selangor State Park near Kuala Lumpur taking macrophotographs of the insects in the woods. He was focusing on somewhat rare lacewings as they perched on branches and leaves. On that trip, he was able to get a picture of a yellowish-green one with a black spot on its wing resembling another insect. He had seen it before, but it had flown away before he had been able to photograph it. When he returned, he posted the images to Flickr, with a comment about how lucky he felt to finally get the image in four years of macro photography. Shaun Winterton, a senior entomologist at the California Department of Food and Agriculture, happened across the image shortly afterward. He was struck by the black marks on the wing, which he had never seen on a lacewing before. Despite his extensive field experience, he was unable to identify the species. Colleagues he emailed the link to were also baffled. He emailed Guek and asked him if he had a specimen, as it was possibly an undiscovered species. Guek told him that the lacewing had flown off shortly after he took the picture, so he did not have one. A year later, Guek emailed Winterton and said he had seen the lacewing again and this time he had captured it. Winterton told him to send it to Steven J. Brooks at the Natural History Museum in London. Brooks not only confirmed that it was a previously unknown species, he found a specimen that had been sent to the museum many years earlier from the Malaysian province of Sabah, on the island of Borneo, but had never been classified or studied.

Since 1965, it has been extensively studied by researchers. History and origins Country of origin labelling originated in 1887 when the British government, in an effort to reduce sales of German and other non- English products to English consumers, passed a law requiring products manufactured outside England to be labeled with their country of origin. = United States labeling = In the United States, the labeling of garments came into law under the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (TFPIA).Hinkelman, E., & Shippey, K. (2004). Commodity Index. In Importers Manual USA: The Single Source Encyclopedia for Importing to the United States. (4th ed., pp. 763-764). Novato, California: World Trade Press. The act itself imposes regulations on the advertising and labeling of textile fiber products that are being imported and exported out of the United States. These products are defined in the act as, \\"any fiber, yarn, or fabric used or intended for use in household textile articles\\". Household textile articles include \\"wearing apparel, costumes, draperies, floor coverings, furnishings, and bedding\\". The goal of the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act is to protect producers and consumers against mislabeling or false advertising about the fiber content of textile fiber products. It wasn't until 1984 that the TFPIA was amended to include items made in The United States stating that they were \\"Made in U.S.A\\". Along with outlining each fiber used within the product, the manufacturer must label country-of-origin information.Ward, P. (1986). Other Laws for Which the FTC has Enforcement Responsibilities. In Federal Trade Commission: Law, Practice and Procedure. New York, New York: Law Journal Press. This information must be readily accessible on garments for quick examination. Garments that include a neck must adhere a label midway between the shoulder seams on the inside center of the neck. Garments or products that do not include a neck must incorporate a country-of-origin label on a visible area on the inner or outer parts of the product. From the time that the act was introduced, the importing of apparel increased drastically in the United States. While this helped the economy domestically and globally, it also hurt the clothing manufacturing industry in the US. Before the act, 95% of clothing purchased in the US was produced stateside. Now, less than 4% purchased is made within the United States.B√©dat, M., & Darabi, S. (2015, April 24). On Fashion Revolution Day, Ask The Important Question: Who Made My Clothes? Retrieved September 20, 2015, from https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in- progress/2015/04/24/on-fashion-revolution-day-ask-the-important-question-who- made-my-clothes/ In some cases, manufacturing goods on a mass level can require many different suppliers and manufacturers to complete a finished product. More often than not, the tasks associated with completing a finished product do not take place in just one single manufacturer or country. In an article for the Business of Fashion, Solca states that, \\"Made in disclosures are not required for products traded within the European Union. Even where required, 'Made in' criteria are easy to meet: cost thresholds can be reached with finishing, quality control and packaging, while manufacturing is kept offshore\\".Solca, L. (2015, June 14). The 'Made In' Dilemma: To Label, or Not to Label. Retrieved September 20, 2015, from http://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/opinion/the-made-in-dilemma-to- label-or-not-to-label Description and strength Research suggests that country of origin (COO) serves as a cue from which consumers make inferences about product and product attributes. The COO cue triggers a global evaluation of quality, performance, or specific product attributes. Consumers infer attributes to the product based on country stereotype and experiences with products from that country. Hence, a COO cue has become an important information cue for consumers who are exposed to far more internationalized product selection and multinational marketing than ever before. Thereby, the country of origin may even affect consumers' perceptions beyond their conscious control. Research into COO has focused on various issues linking COO with other marketing variables, including consumer nationalism, demographics, hybrid products, brand effects, product quality, price, consumer perceptions, technology sophistication, product features, advertising images, and country images, to measure consumer perceptions and purchasing behavior (Ahmed et al., 2004; Badri, Davis, & Davis, 1995; Hamzaoui & Merunka, 2006). It has been empirically demonstrated that the COO effect has significant price-related consequences and brands with favorable COO associations are able to charge price premiums, over and above those attributed to observed product differentiation (Saridakis & Baltas, 2016). The country of origin effect is strongest on older consumers and those who don't know much about the product or product type, and weakest on consumers who are well-informed. Sensitivity to country of origin varies by product category. It is strongest for durable goods and luxury goodsAiello, G., Donvito, R., Godey, B., Pederzoli, D., Wiedmann, K.-P., Hennings, N., Siebels, A., Chan, P., Tsuchiya, J., Rabino, S., Ivanovna, S. I., Weitz, B., Oh, H., & Singh, R. 2008. An International Perspective on Luxury Brand and Country-of-Origin Effect. Brand Management, 16(5/6): 323-337. and weakest for \\"low involvement\\" product categories such as shampoo, candy, light bulbs, toilet paper and athletic shoes. When the countries of design, manufacture and the parent brand are different, research suggests all three matter to consumers, but the country of manufacture may matter most. Some research suggests that younger consumers care significantly less than older people about country of origin, but other studies resulted in different findings. The research on whether men or women care more about country of origin is also inconclusive. A U.S. study found American college students more willing to buy a \\"made in China\\" teddy bear when it was sold at an American store they believed was benevolent, competent and honest, suggesting that negative country of origin effects may be offset when consumers trust the store selling the product. Associations  Consumers have a relative preference or aversion for products, depending on the products' country of origin (this is called affinityOberecker, E. M., Riefler, P., & Diamantopoulos, A. 2008. The Consumer Affinity Construct: Conceptualization, Qualitative Investigation, and Research Agenda. Journal of International Marketing, 16(3): 23-56. and animosityKlein, J. G., Ettenson, R., & Morris, M. D. 1998. The Animosity Model of Foreign Product Purchase: An Empirical Test in the People's Republic of China. Journal of Marketing, 62(1): 89-100.). In some countries consumers tend to prefer products made in their own countryShimp, T. A. & Sharma, S. 1987. Consumer Ethnocentrism: Construction and Validation of the CETSCALE. Journal of Marketing Research, 24(3): 280-289. (also known as consumer ethnocentrism) and in others foreign- made products tend to be preferred. A preference for locally-made products has been linked to a collectivist culture, and a preference for foreign-made products is associated with a more individualistic, competitive culture, and also with countries that are less economically developed. One of the biggest challenges many Asian companies face as they globalise is the perception that Asian brands are inferior. Research in international marketing has proven that country associations do lead to customer bias and this bias depends on how a customer views the image of a country. French wine, German cars, Japanese robots, Colombian coffee, Italian fashion, Singaporean efficiency, Swiss chocolate. Somewhere in our minds, these products and services are associated with particular countries owing to their legacy or culture or lifestyle, which automatically leads us to perceive them as 'premium'. Some brands have even been given foreign names, to create a perceived 'COO' effect. H√§agen-Dazs, the US-based ice cream company started by Jewish-Polish immigrants in New York, in 1961, was deliberately given a Scandinavian-sounding name to convey an aura of the old-world traditions and craftsmanship. Many factors contribute to the country image including: of the country's economy: most countries with a positive COO effect are highly industrialized, developed countries extent of technological advancement of a country: the higher the technological capability of a country, the more positive is the COO effect form of government: the success of capitalism and the resulting market economy around the world has created inherent perceptions (often negative) about countries that do not follow capitalism. A related aspect is the reputation of the government and its corporate governance ‚Äì how bureaucratic, transparent, corrupt or efficient is a country's government? Consumers are generally felt to perceive Chinese products as low-quality, and to associate \\"made in China\\" labelling with value pricing, unskilled labour and inexpensive materials. In 2007 and 2008 China's reputation suffered worldwide due to product safety institutions in many parts of the world recalling Chinese-made products, such as pet food, toys, toothpaste and lipstick, because of concerns about their quality and safety. Spain withdraws Chinese toothpaste from the oral care market CosmesticsDesigns.com. 12 July 2007 .Accessed: 2007-09-05. Some products are strongly associated with a particular country, such as (in the Western world) silk with China, spices with India, wine with France, chocolate with Belgium, cars with Germany, fashion with Italy and electronics with Japan. Such products labeled as originating in that country will benefit from a halo effect, with consumers assuming they are high quality. Countries that are less economically developed tend to have a negative country image and a negative country-of-origin effect. Associations vary by country and region. Japan is universally understood to manufacture high-quality products, and yet historical animosity between it and some other Eastern Asian countries may reduce those countries' purchasing of Japanese products. A 1965 study found Guatemalan students gave lower evaluations to products from El Salvador and Costa Rica than to domestic and Mexican products because of a general negative attitude toward people from El Salvador and Guatemala. French consumers avoid buying American products due to animosity towards U.S. politics and perceived U.S. passivity during the French Revolution. Throughout Southeast Asia, Korean goods are very highly valued. COO for services With the increasing importance of the service sector, also research has focussed on the influences of COO on service perception. Although not as intensively researched as with products, COO is proven to apply also on Services, e.g. when expecting a higher degree of engineering consulting by a German consultancy firm. COO marketing Companies are seeking to communicate the COO and to increase their customer's COO awareness with a number of different strategies:Aichner, T. 2014. Country-of-origin marketing: A list of typical strategies with examples. Journal of Brand Management, 21(1): 81-93. * Use of the phrase \\"Made in...\\" * Use of quality and origin labels * COO embedded in the company name * Typical COO words embedded in the company name * Use of the COO language * Use of famous or stereotypical people from the COO * Use of COO flags and symbols * Use of typical landscapes or famous buildings from the COO Fluctuations Perceptions of countries and their products change over time. Since the late 19th century the German reputation for quality and attention to detail has helped it sell products internationally, but its reputation was significantly damaged during the First World War and Second World War.

When he tried to enter the canteen to get some beer at about 11 p.m., he found the door blocked from the inside by several guests. After he was finally let in, he got into an argument with Geofrey Ruhara for this provocation, whereupon all the guests were taken out of the canteen. Outside, Ruhara apologized to Ogwang, who, still angered about the incident, then went home. Upon returning to the barracks he fetched his gun, which was described as an SMG rifle, and made his way back to the Trading Centre. Just after midnight Ogwang began shooting in the canteen, where he first shot dead Geofrey Ruhara, before killing John Rutaro, Patrick Kugonza, and Stephen Chance. Yelling \\"I will finish you all!\\" he then turned his rifle against the crowd in the dancing hall. When the generator was switched off, and the lights went out in the building, Ogwang stopped firing and fled. By then he had killed 13 people and wounded 14 others. In the morning, at about 7 a.m., he was met at the barracks by Inspector Kisembo, who said he was awakened by some shots. Ogwang aimed his rifle at Kisembo, who managed to wrest it from the gunman's hands after a short struggle. While Kisembo went back to sleep, Ogwang escaped to Dura where he had a brother at an army post. There, he was arrested the next day and brought back to Kamwenge. An examination of his mental state, conducted on 29 December, found him to be sane. During his trial Ogwang denied having committed the murders, saying that he had handed his rifle to a member of the Local Defence Unit at the entrance of the disco, not knowing what had happened to it afterwards. He also stated that he was too drunk to remember anything that night, and that he only learned about the shooting the next morning, when an angry crowd appeared at the barracks, accusing him of killing people at the disco, though the judge dismissed all of these claims and found him guilty of 13 counts of murder. Ogwang was sentenced to death by hanging, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2010.http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/688334-1009630-baasr5z/index.html See also * Bombo shooting * Kampala wedding massacre References Category:Mass murder in 1994 Category:Massacres in Uganda Category:1994 crimes in Uganda Category:Kamwenge District Category:Spree shootings in Uganda Category:December 1994 events in Africa ","title":"Kamwenge Trading Centre shooting"},{"id":"36674597","text":"Tityus exstinctus is an extinct species of scorpion belonging to the family Buthidae.

The player controls a small white creature named Mutron-kun. The creature has a large eye from which bubbles can be shot. These bubbles then kill the various and diverse enemies that attack, for example skeletal monkeys, space ships and spinning discs. Mutron-kun also has the ability to jump and remain floating for a period of time by the repeated pressing of the jump button. Gameplay Mutant Night is a shoot'em up game of the \\"Run & Gun\\" type: the players controls Mutron-kun shooting at enemies while avoiding their attacks. Unlike most run & gun games, Mutant Night has almost no platform part and the character's shooting power is very limited: short range and not multi- directional, the bubble are always shot in the direction the character is facing. The game is divided in various levels or acts and focuses on fast- paced action and memorization. The levels are very short and straightforward, with a level design relying only on enemies attack patterns and on the game's physics to challenge the player. Mutron-kun can walk left or right, shoot bubbles and jump, and hurries to reach a small trapdoor at the end of each level. The difficulty curve of the game increases significantly after the first level and can be somewhat unforgiving. Power ups are available in the form of small pink pods on the ground which when shot release a coloured orb into the air, which can do one of the following: make Mutron-kun very large and indestructible for the short period, transform Mutron-kun into multiple creatures, award extra points or grant increased fire power in a scatter shot pattern. The size changing bonus is one of the most notable feature of the game: the character grows into an invincible giant, destroying all enemies on its way. Similar bonuses appear in later games from various editors like Red Company's Bonk 3: Bonk's Big Adventure (1993) for the TurboGrafx 16 or New Super Mario Bros. (2006) for the Nintendo DS by Nintendo. Another notable feature is the \\"cumulative jump\\": by pressing the jump button multiple times while still in the air, Mutron-kun can chain several jumps, reach higher positions and float in the air. Doing so, Mutron-kun is however subject to a certain inertia which makes control more difficult. The game makes use of this feature by challenging the player to get the bonuses: colored orbs released from the pink pods immediately float away, forcing the player to jump higher to reach them. If the \\"cumulative jump\\" ability is limited in the three first levels, it becomes unlimited from level 4, allowing Mutron-kun to literally walk in the air for as long as wanted. In several of the following levels, the gameplay will make use of this feature: some levels have to be completed mostly air-walking, as touching the ground outside of a few safe spots means immediate death. While there's no limitation in time when using \\"air walking\\", after a long walk in the air Mutron-kun will need to rest for a few seconds after landing, making him very vulnerable to enemies attacks. Legacy Mutant Night was only available as an arcade system and was never ported to any other system. The game Atomic Robo-Kid from 1988, another side scrolling shoot'em up game by UPL, could be considered a sequel to Mutant Night as it bears interesting similarities: * Tsutomu Fuzisawa, the game's designer, creating the character design in Mutant Night. * The graphic atmospheres are very close, one level in Atomic Robo-Kid even actually using graphics from a forest level from Mutant Night, only slightly enhanced. * Levels are similarly named as \\"Act\\". * Atomic Robo-Kid also borrows elements from the \\"Run & Gun\\" genre, starting with a main character who can only walk. Flying capacity must be acquired. * The helping character \\"Mini Doragon\\" (Name credited in Atomic Robo-Kid's ending credits) appears in both games. * While the detail in Mutant Night was the animated remaining lives icons (Miniature Mutron-kun animating when a life is lost).

It was first screened in theaters ahead of the 3D theatrical re release of Finding Nemo. Partysaurus Rex is the third and final short in the trilogy of Toy Story Toons, based on the characters from the Toy Story feature films. The short involves Rex getting left in a bathroom, and making new friends with bath toys. Plot Rex disrupts the other toys blowing soap bubbles, worried that they may ruin Bonnie's house. He is chastised by the other toys, with Mr. Potato Head calling him \\"Partypooper Rex\\". The other toys sense Bonnie approaching, and scatter, leaving Rex alone when she enters. She takes him to play with, while she takes a bath, until Bonnie's mother comes to turn off the bath, pull out the plug, and take her out to go to her grandmother's house. The bath toys are happy to see Rex, but soon the water gets drained, leaving them on dry land. Sad, the bath toys wish that they could continue to have fun, but all of them lack arms (except Rex) and can only function if afloat in the water. Rex initially thinks drawing a new bath is a bad idea, but after recalling Mr. Potato Head's insult, he asserts that he is \\"Partysaurus Rex\\", and helps the bath toys to start a new bath. The toys quickly start to sing and dance, in a rave like fashion, aided by a carefree Rex, throwing a bubble bath solution into the tub, and blocking the overflow drain, with a frog sponge. However, he suddenly realises that if the tub overflows, the water will leak out into the hall. Rex tries to turn off the water, but only causes the handle to fall off, and the drain stays plugged, when he tries to pull it out. Finally, he spots the knob on the faucet that stops the flow from it, but realises that this only diverts the water to the showerhead. The tub starts to overflow, but the other bath toys are unconcerned about the problem and continue to party. Outside the bathroom, Woody, Buzz, and some of the other toys arrive to check on Rex, when the bathroom door suddenly bursts open, and a flood of water pours out. Later, Bonnie's mother is paying to have plumbing repairs done to the house. Though he knows it was his fault, Rex enjoys the short lived fame with the other toys in Bonnie's room, as Mr. Potato Head is still getting the water out of himself. Outside, several pool toys have heard of Rex's exploits from the bath toys, and get him to agree to help turn on the outside faucet, to let them party as well. Rex quickly joins in on their fun.

It's a short for Toy Story, and I'm not allowed to say the whole story, but quite literally, it's like a Toy Story rave, and I'm actually not kidding either.

Life and career Born in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Milligan graduated with a bachelor's in education from what is now Carnegie Mellon University and received her masters in school administration from University of Pittsburgh. She was one of the first two women who were awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree from Carnegie Mellon. Prior to enlisting in the military, she worked as a secretary, teacher, and assistant principal. She enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, where she started as a private in an experiment using women as military professionals. Lt. Col. Mary Louise Milligan receives the Legion of Merit from Maj. Gen. Willard S. Paul, Director of Personnel and Administration, 1946.

In five and a half years as director, WAC strength increased from 8,300, on 31 January 1957, to 11,100. The Army had opened twenty-six new military occupational specialties (MOSs) for active duty enlisted women and fifty for WAC reservists. New legislation included a provision to eliminate WAC officer promotion restrictions. Congress had granted active duty credit for WAAC time to women with further military service, and it had corrected inequities for WAC reserve officers. Colonel Rasmuson's public relations efforts enhanced the WAC image and helped convince the public and the Army of the value of WAC service. In 1961, she married Elmer E.

The ride was the first wooden roller coaster manufactured by Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC) and the first wooden roller coaster with multiple inversions, in which riders are turned upside-down and then back upright. The ride features three inversions and a top speed of , making Outlaw Run the sixth-fastest wooden roller coaster in the world. The first drop of the ride is the fourth steepest in the world among wooden roller coasters, at 81¬∞. Planning for Outlaw Run began in 2009, three years before its official announcement in August 2012. Rocky Mountain Construction were contracted to manufacture the ride as their proposal best suited Silver Dollar City's available space and budget. The ride's track layout was designed by Alan Schilke. Outlaw Run opened to the public on March 15, 2013, to generally positive reviews. Planning, marketing, and construction A train going through a banked turn Planning for a new 2013 attraction in the Silver Dollar City amusement park began in 2009 with the owners, Herschend Family Entertainment, approaching Rocky Mountain Construction and other manufacturers for ideas for \\"a ride with marketing appeal\\". Joel Manby, CEO of Herschend, wanted a \\"world first\\", to have a wooden roller coaster that would be \\"the first to do a double barrel roll\\", which is when the train goes twice through a combination of a loop and a roll. In 2011, Rocky Mountain Construction showcased their new steel roller coaster, New Texas Giant, to park executives. This demonstration secured the contract. Marketing began in 2011 when the public were made aware at the 2011 trade show of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions that Rocky Mountain were working on a wooden roller coaster; it being later revealed that this roller coaster would be built at Silver Dollar City. Following the beginning of construction at the park, Silver Dollar City launched a teaser website for a new attraction to open in 2013. The website featured a public notice indicating that the ride's theme would be stagecoaches and the wild west. The teaser website also stated that an announcement would be made on August 9, 2012. As part of its teaser campaign leading to the announcement, the park released two clues; the first clue was a handwritten letter, while the second was a photo of the park's Powder Keg: A Blast into the Wilderness attraction and the nearby Table Rock Lake. On August 9, 2012, Silver Dollar City officially announced that Outlaw Run would open in the second quarter of 2013. At its opening, the ride would be the only wooden roller coaster to feature inversions and would feature the steepest drop on a wooden roller coaster. At a cost of $10 million, the ride would be the most expensive Silver Dollar City attraction in more than a decade. On September 26, 2012, the last piece of track was installed on Outlaw Run. The ride opened to a limited audience on March 13, 2013, with a public opening two days later. Official opening celebrations were held in April. Characteristics Outlaw Run was Rocky Mountain Construction's first wooden roller coaster. It is the sixth fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, reaching speeds of up to . Throughout the course of the ride, riders go through three inversions, including a double heartline roll. The park's existing terrain (the park is located in the Ozark Mountains) is used to allow a lift hill to be translated into a first drop stretching . Lift hill The of track is made primarily of layers of laminated wood, with a steel plate located in the upper layers of the track. The steel plating is known as Topper Track and is found on many roller coasters that Rocky Mountain Construction has renovated. This track style is designed to reduce the maintenance typically required for a wooden roller coaster and to provide a smoother ride experience. Rocky Mountain Construction spent four years developing technology to allow them to twist beams of wood, that make up the lower layers of the track. This track configuration allows for more dynamic roller coaster elements to be performed on a wooden roller coaster. Outlaw Run consists of two trains, each featuring twelve pairs of riders. Riders, who must be 48 inches (122 cm) or taller to ride, are restrained in their individual fiberglass seats with a U-shaped lap bar. Unlike most roller coaster trains, which have polyurethane wheels, Outlaw Run features steel wheels. Outlaw Run features a Western stagecoach theme. The ride's station is themed as a stagecoach depot located in the outskirts of Silver Dollar City. According to the ride's storyline, stagecoaches depart daily heading west, where they are intercepted by outlaws who want to steal the riders' belongings. Outlaw Run riders are law enforcement personnel tasked with stopping the outlaws. To keep their family-friendly image, Silver Dollar City uses a variety of theming to advertise that the \\"good guys\\" will always win. Ride experience One of the inversions The train exits out of the station and ascends the chain lift hill. The track then goes through a small pre-drop, similar to that on Bolliger & Mabillard steel roller coasters, before dropping at an angle of 81¬∞. The train then ascends into the first element, an outside banked turn, where the track is banked over to 153¬∞ before rolling back out of the bank. After going around a low-to-the-ground curve, the train enters a double down followed by a double up. This is followed by a left turn into a \\"twist and turn\\" element, which is then followed by a \\"wave turn\\" that drops to the right into a small airtime hill known as a high-speed float. Outlaw Run's final two inversions are heartline rolls, where the rotation axis occurs at approximately chest level. The train then enters the brake run and returns to the station. A single ride cycle is completed in approximately 1 minute and 27 seconds. Records Outlaw Run debuted with the steepest drop, 81¬∞, on any wooden roller coaster in the world at the time. Although the creators of Outlaw Run originally planned to claim the record for the only operating wooden roller coaster to feature inversions, the announcement of Hades 360 at Mt. Olympus Water & Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, forced Silver Dollar City to modify their claim; they now cite Outlaw Run as the only wooden roller coaster to feature multiple inversions. It is also tied with Colossos at Heide Park as the second fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, with a top speed of . The speed, height, and drop angle records were broken by Goliath at Six Flags Great America in the first half of 2014. Goliath is another Rocky Mountain Construction roller coaster. Outlaw Run retains the record for the wooden roller coaster with the most inversions. Reception Outlaw Run's brake run Following the announcement of Outlaw Run, the ride's layout received favorable reviews. Arthur Levine of About.com said that \\"the coaster appears to have a great layout and should provide the kind of ride that fans adore\\". Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times ranked Outlaw Run in his top 13 most anticipated new theme park attractions in the United States for 2013. Outlaw Run received largely positive reviews following the ride's opening in 2013. Marcus Leshock of WGN-TV was among the first to ride Outlaw Run. Despite his high expectations, he described it as \\"a great ride; an incredible ride\\". Brandy McDonnell of The Oklahoman described Outlaw Run as the highlight of Silver Dollar City: \\"it's a speedy and spine-tingling ride worth waiting a few hours to take\\". Tim Baldwin of Roller Coaster Magazine described Outlaw Run as \\"exhilarating but not intimidating\\" and \\"satisfying to the thrill seekers and fun for moms as well\\". Justin Garvanovic of First Drop Magazine, after describing pacing as an important characteristic of a roller coaster, said \\"So many coasters get it wrong. Outlaw Run gets it right.\\" In its debut year, Outlaw Run ranked highly in Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards. The ride won the Golden Ticket Award for Best New Ride with 45% of the vote. It also ranked at position 7 for the world's best wooden roller coasters.

The organization serves families in six communities: Jane- Finch, Flemingdon-Park, St. James Town, Kingston-Galloway, Victoria Village, and Willowtree.  History  Toronto City Mission was established on November 14, 1879 by a group of ministers and laymen, to improve the spiritual and material welfare of the poor throughout the Toronto area. The focus was on assisting needy parents, children, widows, the elderly, the sick, hungry and deserted, and the unemployed, and on preaching the Christian gospel. In 1894 the mission took over the work of the Fred Victor Mission. In 1894, the mission purchased a home in what was then Bronte, which was used as a country camp for families and children from Toronto until 1977. The mission provided food, clothing, Christian evangelism and a break from the city heat. In 1898 a group of three woman doctors founded a dispensary for poor women at the mission's Sackville Street location. This later grew to become Women's College Hospital.  Current activities  In 1999, the Toronto City Mission changed its focus from being a provider of shelter, food and clothing resources to a provider of self and community improvement opportunities. The mission organized a number of programs based on Christian values and beliefs; the programs are open to people from all religions, race and sexual orientation. About 180 children from grades one to six attend after school programming and tutoring programs. Youth who are in Junior High and Senior High are offered after school programming, tutoring, and mentorship. A youth leadership program called TLC (Teens Leading Community) allows youth to give back to their communities by being volunteers and leaders of the children's programs. In conjunction with the Sprott Foundation, the mission provides the Role Model Moms Program in the Jane-Finch Community, with the goal of helping young mothers to pass the high school equivalency exam regulated by the government of Ontario. There is also a Men's basketball program in St. James Town.

Though nominated to the Royal Academy as an architect, he was usually represented at its exhibitions by busts and low reliefs.Hodgson 1905, p.104 He exhibited there between 1869 and 1800, starting with a work described in the catalogue as \\"a marble bas-relief, an Indian, representing North America, offering the produce of that country to Britannia\\". In later years he did show some architectural drawings, for the \\"Garden front of a villa\\" (1782); Dorchester prison (1784); \\"a Belvidere to be built in a shrubbery\\" (1785); \\"the front of a prison\\" (1786); Bridport Town Hall (1789) and the \\"Villa Maria\\" (1800).

Biography She won the title Binibining Pilipinas International through Binibining Pilipinas 2012 pageant where she was also titled as Best in Swimsuit and Best in National Costume from that edition. In the question-and-answer portion, Schmitz, a law student, was asked by one of the judges John Martin Miller, \\"Which you would rather be, someone who's respected or someone who is loved and why?\\" Her answer: \\"I would rather be someone respected because that means you maintain your integrity, dignity and self-respect and that means that in turn you will be loved by whoever matters and everyone around you.\\" At that time, 'Nicole Schmitz' trended on Twitter both Worldwide and Philippines. After winning, she got a courtesy call from the mayor of her hometown Cebu City specifically in Liloan. She received a token of appreciation. She also had a homecoming on her mother's hometown Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, Mindanao. This is where she was also invited as a judge for the Search for BB. Jimenez 2012.

In anyone's life, it doesn't benefit them if they're gonna regret something so what I do to combat that is that I just make sure that everything I do it's because I want to do it. I don't do something with any doubts in my mind. I do it with sureness and I'm very confident in myself and in that way, that's how I combat that.

The colony was the immediate area surrounding Bathurst (now Banjul), and the protectorate was the inland territory situated around the Gambia River, which was declared in 1894. The foundation of the colony was Fort James and Bathurst, where British presence was established in 1815 and 1816, respectively. For various periods in its existence it was subordinate to the Sierra Leone Colony, however by 1888 it was a colony in its own right with a permanently appointed Governor. The boundaries of the territory were an issue of contention between the British and French authorities due to the proximity to French Senegal. Additionally, on numerous occasions the British government had attempted to exchange it with France for other territories, such as on the upper Niger River.Thomas Pakenham (1991), The Scramble for Africa. London: Abacus. p. 675 France and Britain agreed in 1889 in principle to set the boundary at six miles north and south of the river and east to Yarbutenda, the furthest navigable point on the river Gambia. This should have been followed by the dispatchment of a joint Anglo-French Boundary Commission to map the actual border. Yet, at its arrival on place in 1891, the boundary commission was met with resistance by local leaders whose territories they were coming to divide. The boundary commission could nevertheless rely on British naval power; British ships bombed the town of Kansala to force the Gambians to back off, and according to the 1906 The Gambia Colony and Protectorate: An Official Handbook men and guns from three warships landed on the riverbanks ‚Äúas a hint of what the resisters had to expect in the event of any continued resistance.‚ÄùAtlas Obscura The colony ended in 1965 when The Gambia became an independent state within the Commonwealth of Nations,The Gambia Independence Act 1964, c. 93 with Dawda Jawara as Prime Minister. Economy The economy of The Gambia, like other African countries at the time, was very heavily orientated towards agriculture. Reliance on the groundnut became so strong that it made up almost the entirety of exports, making the economy vulnerable. Groundnuts were the only commodity subject to export duties; these export duties resulted in the illegal smuggling of the product to French Senegal. Attempts were made to increase production of other goods for export: the Gambian Poultry Scheme pioneered by the Colonial Development Corporation aimed to produce twenty million eggs and one million lb of dressed poultry a year. The conditions in The Gambia proved unfavourable and typhoid killed much of the chicken stock, drawing criticism to the Corporation. =Transport= The River Gambia was the principal route of navigation and transport inland, with a port at Bathurst. The road network was mainly concentrated around Bathurst, with the remaining areas largely connected by dirt roads. The only airport was at Yundum, built in World War II. Post war it was used for passenger flights. Both British South American Airways and the British Overseas Airways Corporation had services, the former moving its service to Dakar, which had a concrete runway (as opposed to pierced steel planking). The airport was rebuilt in 1963 and the building is still in use today.  Government structure  During the later colonial period, especially in post-1901, The Gambia began to have a more developed colonial government. Roles in the government, though taken by white British officials, included examples such as the Attorney General, the Senior Medical Officer, the Controller of Customs, the Receiver General, and the Director of Public Works. The colony was governed by the Executive Council primarily, but legislation came from the Legislative Council. Independence In anticipation of independence, efforts were made to create internal self- government. The 1960 Constitution created a partly elected House of Representatives, with 19 elected members and 8 chosen by the chiefs. This constitution proved flawed in the 1960 elections when the two major parties tied with 8 seats each. With the support of the unelected chiefs, Pierra Sarr N'Jie of the United Party was appointed Chief Minister. Dawda Jawara of the People's Progressive Party resigned as Minister of Education, triggering a Constitutional Conference arranged by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Constitutional Conference paved the way for a new constitution that granted a greater degree of self-government and a House of Representatives with more elected members. Elections were held in 1962, with Jawara's Progressive Party securing a majority of the elected seats. Under the new constitutional arrangements, Jawara was appointed Prime Minister: a position he held until it was abolished in 1970. Following agreements between the British and Gambian governments in July 1964, The Gambia became independent on 18 February 1965.

He was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts and served as its principal in 1893/95. One of his best students was Jan Matejko, the eminent Polish historical painter and later, his close associate. ≈Åuszczkiewicz taught painting, drawing, anatomy and architectural styles. Highly educated, he also worked as conservator of architectural monuments in the city later on in his career, and wrote historical dissertations. Life W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åuszczkiewicz was born in Krak√≥w in 1828 and after graduating from St Anne High School (where his father Micha≈Ç of the Rola coat of arms was a professor), he enrolled at the Department of History of the Jagiellonian University. At the same time, he began to study painting at the School of Fine Arts with Wojciech Stattler and Jan Nepomucen G≈Çowacki. His talent was rewarded with a scholarship which enabled ≈Åuszczkiewicz to continue his studies at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1849. While in France, he also developed his lifelong interest in historicism. Gifting the Silver Fowler to the Krak√≥w Fowler Brotherhood, 1873, oil on canvas at the National Museum, Krak√≥w ≈Åuszczkiewicz began to teach art while still a student himself. His beloved Krak√≥w was under the military rule of Austria-Hungary, and all fields of education were grossly neglected. He often gave private art classes for free to struggling artists. ≈Åuszczkiewicz was nominated as professor at the Academy in 1877. Among his students (aside from Matejko) were the future luminaries of Polish art of the turn-of-the-century including Artur Grottger, Aleksander Kotsis, J√≥zef Mehoffer, Jacek Malczewski, Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski and Wojciech Weiss. He introduced them to plein-air painting by organizing trips to places of historical significance outside the city. In 1883 he was chosen as director of the National Museum in Krak√≥w. In 1893/95 he served as rector of the Academy of Fine Arts. His own historical paintings filled with knowledge of period artifacts and costume, were a great source of inspiration for Jan Matejko. They often came into being as pictorial representations of his scientific discoveries and literature on the subject. He stopped painting towards the end of his life and turned entirely to writing and art conservation advocacy. In recognition of his work, ≈Åuszczkiewicz was awarded the title of doctor honoris causa of the Jagiellonian University in 1900, and died in Krak√≥w prior to award ceremony in the same year. He was married to Malwina Ramloff (1858) and had four children: Napoleon, Zofia, Wojciech J√≥zef, and Maria.

Here a waterfall cascades down rocky mountain side making its way through many streams and ponds among the shady palm trees. History Legend relates that Pir Ghaib and his sister, the venerable Bibi Nani, arrived here to convert the locals in the early days of Islam. But the fire worshippers sent an army after the pious pair. In the gorge of the Bolan, the siblings split; Bibi Nani went down the gorge (her purported tomb is under a bridge about 15 km downstream) while her brother fled into this arid landscape with the army in hot pursuit. At the head of the gorge, seeing that he was blocked by the rock wall, the saint prayed to almighty to be rescued. He cleaved the rock to receive the holy man. So, he was known as Pir Ghaib ‚Äì The Invisible Saint. Local Hindus worship Pir Ghaib as Mahadev. But, long before the Bolan gorge had rung with Vedic hymns or invocations of the Pir Ghaib, travellers and traders from the Indus Valley would have stopped at this spring sacred to their own gods on the first leg of their long journey to Mesopotamian marts. As the Vedic God Shivaderives from an earlier Indus Valley deity, and as the 5000 year old goddess Nania evolves into Bibi Nani or Durga, so too did the Pir Ghaib develop from an early Indus Valley god. But until the Indus script is understood we will not know which from this pantheon was celebrated for walking into rock walls.

Governor Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour (a Protestant) had been granted one area of territory by King Louis XIV, and Charles de Menou d'Aulnay (a Catholic) had been granted another area. The divisions made by the king were geographically uninformed, and the two territories and their administrative centres overlapped. The conflict was intensified by personal animosity between the two governors, and came to an end when d'Aulnay successfully expelled la Tour from his holdings. D'Aulnay's success was effectively overturned after his death when la Tour married D'Aulnay's widow in 1653.https://archive.org/stream/s3collections07massuoft#page/90/mode/2uphttps://archive.org/stream/collectionsmass13socigoog#page/n494/mode/2up Historical context In 1635, Governor of Acadia Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay moved settlers from present-day LaHave, Nova Scotia to Port- Royal, and the Acadian people began to establish their roots. Under Aulnay, the Acadians built the first dykes in North America and cultivated the reclaimed salt marshes. During this time, Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war; the two main centres were Port-Royal (present day Annapolis Royal), where Aulnay was stationed, and present-day Saint John, New Brunswick, where Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour was stationed.M. A. MacDonald, Fortune & La Tour: The civil war in Acadia, Toronto: Methuen. 1983 In an effort to defend Acadia, Castine was founded in the winter of 1613, when Claude de Saint-Etienne de la Tour established a small trading post. In 1625, Charles de Saint-√âtienne de la Tour erected a fort named Fort Pentagou√´t.Faulkner and Faulkner, p. 219 After the English had captured the fort, in 1635, Governor Isaac de Razilly of Acadia sent Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay to retake the village.M. A. MacDonald. Fortune and La Tour, p. 63 In 1638, Aulnay built a more substantial fort named Fort Saint-Pierre. While he had other ventures in Acadia, Fort Pentagoet was his major outpost on the frontier with New England. The strategic location at the mouth of the Saint John River was fortified by Charles de la Tour in 1631. The fort was named Fort Sainte-Marie (AKA Fort La Tour) and was located on the east side of the river. Both La Tour and Aulnay had claims of some legitimacy to the governorship of Acadia because the French Imperial officials made their appointments with an incomplete understanding of the geography of the area. La Tour had a fortified settlement at the mouth of the Saint John River while Aulnay's base was at Port Royal some 45 miles across the Bay of Fundy. In adjoining New England, the people supported La Tour's claim since he allowed them to fish and lumber in and along the Bay of Fundy without let or hindrance while Aulnay aggressively sought payment for that right. Word came to La Tour that Aulnay was concentrating men and materials for an attack on La Tour's fort and fur-trading operation at the mouth of the Saint John River. La Tour went to Boston to ask John Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts Bay colony, for help. Winthrop arranged for several merchants to advance loans unofficially to La Tour for his purchase of men and material to defend the Saint John River fort from Aulnay's attack. War =Battle of Port Royal (1640)= La Tour arrived from present-day Saint John and attacked Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal) with two armed ships. D'Aulnay's captain was killed, while La Tour and his men were forced to surrender. In response to the attack, d'Aulnay sailed out of Port-Royal to establish a blockade of La Tour's fort at present-day Saint John. =Blockade of St. John (1642)= Charles de Menou d'Aulnay (19th century portrait, probably a copy of a 1642 portrait) For five months, the Governor of Acadia d'Aulnay, who was stationed at Port Royal, created a blockade of the river to defeat La Tour at his fort. On 14 July 1643, La Tour arrived from Boston with four ships and a complement of 270 men to repossess Fort Sainte-Marie. After this victory, La Tour went on to attack d'Aulnay at Port Royal, Nova Scotia. LaTour was unsuccessful then in catching d'Aulnay and the rivalry continued for several more years. = Battle of Penobscot (1643) = After the blockade of St. John, d'Aulney was pursued by la Tour to Penobscot Bay, where d'Aulney ran two of his ships and another smaller vessel aground in order to form an improvised blockade. A small engagement followed at a nearby mill, with both sides suffering three casualties. La Tour's company proceeded to Boston, with a small vessel containing an abundance of moose and beaver skins.Williamson, W. D. (1839). The history of the state of Maine: From its first discovery, A.D. 1602, to the separation, A.D. 1820, inclusive: With an appendix and general index. Hallowell: Glazier, Masters & Smith. p. 313-314 =Battle of Port-Royal (1643)= In 1643 La Tour tried to capture Port-Royal again. La Tour arrived at Saint John from Boston with a fleet of five armed vessels and 270 men and broke the blockade. La Tour then chased d'Aulnay's vessels back across the Bay of Fundy to Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal). D'Aulnay resisted the attack, and seven of his men were wounded and three killed. La Tour did not attack the fort, which was defended by twenty soldiers. La Tour burned the mill, killed the livestock and seized furs, gunpowder and other supplies.Faragher, John Mack, A Great and Noble Scheme, New York; W. W. Norton & Company, 2005. p. 54 =Siege of St. John (1645)= Siege of St. John (1645), \\"Attacking the fort' While La Tour was in Boston, on Easter Sunday 13 April 1645, d'Aulnay sailed across the Bay of Fundy and arrived at La Tour's fort with a force of two hundred men. La Tour's soldiers were led by his wife, Fran√ßoise-Marie Jacquelin, who became known as the Lioness of LaTour for her valiant defence of the fort. After a five-day battle, on 18 April, d'Aulnay offered quarter to all if Fran√ßoise-Marie would surrender the fort. On that basis, knowing she was badly outnumbered, she capitulated, and d'Aulnay had captured La Tour's Fort Sainte-Marie. D'Aulnay then reneged on his pledge of safety for the defenders and treacherously hanged the La Tour garrison, forcing Madame de la Tour to watch with a rope around her neck. Three weeks later, while still in d'Aulnay's hands, she died. With the death of his wife and the loss of his fort, La Tour took refuge in Quebec and did not return to Acadia for the next four years, until after d'Aulnay had died in 1650. Afterward After defeating La Tour at Saint John, from the capital Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal), d'Aulnay administered posts at LaHave, Nova Scotia; Pentagouet (Castine, Maine); Canso, Nova Scotia; Cap Sable (Port La Tour, Nova Scotia); the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy) and Miscou Island. He died in 1650, opening the governorship of Acadia, and prompting La Tour to return. He married d'Aulnay's widow Jeanne_Motin 1653, ending the rivalry. The couple had five children, and hundreds of their descendants live in the Canadian Maritimes today.The Lioness of Acadia - by Susan Poizner The Beaver: Canada's History Magazine Feb/Mar 07 Four years later, Colonel Robert Sedgwick led one hundred New England volunteers and two hundred of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers to capture Port Royal, Nova Scotia. Prior to the battle, Sedgewick captured and plundered La Tour's fort on the Saint John River and took him prisoner.

The pure Kiruna dialect is strongly influenced by Finnish and Me√§nkieli, presumably as a result of immigration from the east. Northern Sami, the original language of the area, has left comparatively little impact on the dialect. In addition, the Kiruna dialect bears a patchwork of small influences from numerous other dialects and languages from the south, including Varmlandic, Jamtlandic, Westrobothnian, Scanian, Danish, V√§stg√∂tska and Angermanlandic. This is because Kiruna had become a prominent settler town by the end of the 19th century, with immigrants flocking to it from across the country. A characteristic trait of the dialect is the word jo (\\"yes\\", especially after a negative question or in quick conversation), pronounced approximately as [] (found in many places in northern Norrland). This is not always used, however, and is only pronounced with ingressive airflow. Another distinctive trait of the Kiruna dialect is a heavy alveolar trill. The Kiruna dialect is fairly commonly spoken in comparison to more endangered North Swedish dialects such as the genuine dialects of Norrbotten and Westrobothnia Lower Lule√• dialect and the Lower Kalix dialect. Unlike these dialects, the Kiruna dialect does not drop word endings. The Kiruna dialect is not a genuine dialect but standard Swedish with mixed regional influences, this is in contrast to the genuine Nordic dialects spoken in the coast of Norrbotten (Pite√•, Lule√• and Kalix) that form a part of the Westrobothnian dialect continuum that differ from standard Swedish to the extent of not being mutually intelligible without prior knowledge.

Biography Philemona Williamson was born in NYC in 1951. Her African- American parents were employed by a wealthy Greek family, and she grew up in their Manhattan home. She recalls a diversity of cultures but no racism when growing up. Her father was the chauffeur and her mother the housekeeper. She said of the environment in the home on Sutton Place that she and her parents maintained \\"a kind of quiet gentility\\" while their employers were involved in an endless \\"Greek passion play.\\" She attended Bennington College, earning a Bachelor's degree in 1973, and went on to NYU where she obtained a Master's degree in 1979. At Bennington she embraced post-modernism, despite the fashion for abstraction in the department. Philemona has worked at Parsons School of Design, The Getty Institute for Education in the Arts, New York State Council on the Arts, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Bard College, Rhode Island School of Design and Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was awarded a Joan Mitchell Foundation grant in 2020. Other awards include a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in Painting (2018), Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant (1990) and New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship (2009). As of 2010 she lived and worked in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, with a studio in Bloomfield. Work and reception Williamson prefers to paint with oil on linen. Many of her pictures show children and adolescents, drawing on her imagination and her own childhood. The paintings, in vibrant colors, may be interpreted as showing sadness or childhood innocence. Her work is postmodernist, figurative art in which she explores her private identity. She has said, \\"I do not make 'black art'. If my work bridges racial gaps, it is because I am sharing a part of myself and I happen to be black. My paintings are about my fascination with color and shape.\\" In her words, \\"My paintings are of pre-adolescent girls and boys, children on the cusp of adulthood. The figures struggle to balance their innocence and awkwardness with their newfound sexuality. The figures are involved in their own drama when the observer discovers them; it is a surprise to both. The questions begin at this point‚Ä¶Who are these children? What are they doing and why? Ethnicity and gender are questioned.\\" According to art essayist Nina Felshin, \\"Life, in Philemona Williamson's paintings, appears to be a balancing act in which there are two sides to every coin and the action intentionally raises more questions than it answers.\\" Art critic Catherine Bernard has said, \\"The tension of the figures, the colors, and the distortion of space are all shadows, however faint, of our dismembered memories.\\" In 1992 she received an Arts in Transit Poster Commission at New York's Union Square Station. Her Folktales from Around the World (2003) is a set of four glass mosaic murals at the Glen Oaks Campus School in Queens. Her work is held by the Sheldon Museum of Art in Lincoln, Nebraska; the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina; Hampton University museum in Hampton, Virginia; Mott-Warsh Art Collection, Flint, Michigan; Reader's Digest Art Collection and AT&T.; Her Seasons decorates the Livonia Avenue (BMT Canarsie Line) subway station in New York City. This 2007 work is a set of stained glass windows on the platform windscreens depicted events related to the four seasons of meteorology. Her pictures have been published as illustrations in Harper's Magazine.

It serves as the training ground and youth academy of PSV Eindhoven and also accommodates its amateur teams. As of the 2014/2015 season Jong PSV play their home games at this facility.  History  De Herdgang was built in 1952. The word ‚Äòherdgang‚Äô originates from triangular squares that marked the end of dirt roads. These spots were used as locations where herds of sheep could graze, with ‚Äòherd‚Äô referring to a herd of animals and ‚Äògang‚Äô being Dutch for ‚Äòway‚Äô or ‚Äòprocess‚Äô. In April 2002, PSV started work on a renovation of the training facilities: a new indoor training hall, a fitness centre, offices and a canteen were added. The construction works were completed in April 2003. Several months later, the youth facilities were also renewed; an idea spearheaded by Guus Hiddink. As a consequence of financial problems at PSV, the ground under De Herdgang was sold to the Eindhoven municipality in a leasehold estate construction in 2011. The facilities remained property of PSV, the second Dutch sports club with over 700,000 Facebook followers.  Facilities  De Herdgang accommodates the training sessions of PSV Eindhoven and all matches and training sessions of the youth and amateur teams. It is located outside of the Eindhoven urban area in woodland surroundings. De Herdgang consists of seven football fields, including a synthetic field. The main field can hold up to 2,500 spectators. The surrounding training facilities include a tennis lane, dressing rooms, a bar and a fitness centre. The available offices are used by the PSV scouting, medical staff and youth academy. Every year, De Herdgang is the host of the Otten Cup, an international tournament organized by PSV Eindhoven for under-19 teams.
