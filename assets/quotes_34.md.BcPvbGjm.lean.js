Recorded in late 2014 at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales, it was produced by the band's lead guitarist Luke Morley and released internationally by earMusic in February 2015. Wonder Days was the first Thunder studio album to be released since Bang! in 2008, as well as the band's first release on earMusic with whom they signed after returning from their second breakup in 2014. After breaking up for a second time in 2009, Thunder returned occasionally for a number of shows between 2011 and 2014, before recording a tenth studio album later in the year. Morley wrote all of the material for the album, with the exception of \\"Black Water\\" which was co-written by Saint Jude vocalist Lynne Jackaman. Much of the album does not feature guitarist and keyboardist Ben Matthews, who spent most of 2014 recovering from head and neck cancer. Wonder Days debuted at number 9 on the UK Albums Chart, marking the band's first top ten album since Behind Closed Doors reached number 5 in 1995. The album also charted in Germany and Sweden for the first time in 20 years, and topped the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. \\"Wonder Days\\", \\"When the Music Played\\" and \\"Resurrection Day\\" were released as singles, while the extended play (EP) Killer was made available as part of various album bundles. Recording and production Despite claiming on multiple occasions since returning from their 2009 breakup that they would not record a tenth studio album, Thunder announced in May 2014 that they would return to the studio to work on new material later in the year. Responding to the question over the band's \\"change of heart\\" regarding the possibility of new material, the band's vocalist Danny Bowes commented that they decided to record a new album after receiving an \\"overwhelming response\\" from fans when they supported Journey and Whitesnake the previous year. In the band's 2016 biography Giving the Game Away: The Thunder Story, the band's lead guitarist Luke Morley added that \\"We hadn't anticipated that reaction at all, so I said to Danny, \\"We should make a record, because we may not get this kind of opportunity again\\".\\" Recording for Wonder Days took place at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales, with Morley once again producing the album. Much of the recording took place without the involvement of second guitarist and keyboardist Ben Matthews, who was diagnosed with head and neck cancer at the beginning of the year and was unable to take part in sessions and shows throughout the year. Speaking about Matthews's absence, bassist Chris Childs reflected that \\"It was different in the studio without Ben – not just musically but also with his personality. He brings a lot to everything we do.\\" Standing in for Matthews at the group's 2014 shows was Peter Shoulder, a bandmate of Morley's in The Union. By November 2014, it was announced that Matthews's treatment had worked and he was given the \\"all-clear\\". Promotion and release Thunder released a music video for \\"Wonder Days\\", which was filmed during the song's debut performance at Loud Park Festival in Tokyo, Japan on 19 October, as the first song from Wonder Days on 25 November 2014. Days later the album was announced for release on earMusic on 16 February 2015. Several editions of Wonder Days were released, including a physical deluxe edition including a bonus disc recorded live at Wacken Open Air in 2013 and a \\"super deluxe bundle\\" which also included a 7\\" vinyl single for the album's title track and an extended play called Killer featuring four new tracks. \\"When the Music Played\\" was released on 10\\" vinyl as a Record Store Day exclusive single on 18 April 2015, before \\"Resurrection Day\\" was released as the third and final single from the album the following day. In promotion of Wonder Days, Thunder announced their first three UK arena headline shows for March 2015, with support bands Reef and Tax the Heat. Bowes explained that while the band \\"would have preferred to do more\\" shows, they did not want to \\"put undue pressure\\" on Matthews, who was still recovering from cancer at the time. The band later played a number of shows in Europe between June and August, including at Download Festival and a ZZ Top support slot at Wembley Arena, toured Europe again in November, played a pair of dates in Japan at the end of the year, and returned to the UK in February 2016. Reception =Commercial= Wonder Days debuted at number 9 on the UK Albums Chart, marking the first time Thunder had reached the UK top ten since 1995's Behind Closed Doors peaked at number 5. It also topped the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart, and reached number 5 on the UK Physical Albums Chart, number 9 on the Scottish Albums Chart, number 31 on the UK Album Downloads Chart, and number 40 on the UK Album Sales Chart. Outside of the UK, the album also registered on album charts in Germany (at number 47), Switzerland (at number 52), Japan (at number 54), and the Wallonia region of Belgium (at number 180). =Critical= Reviewing the album for Classic Rock magazine, Malcolm Dome awarded Wonder Days a rating of four out of five stars, describing it as \\"Classy, fresh and memorable\\". Praising the \\"rigorous, blues- tinged melodic hard rock elements which established the band's reputation in the first place\\", Dome highlighted the performances of guitarist Luke Morley and vocalist Danny Bowes, and hailed the album as \\"a massive reminder that class is both timeless and incandescent\\". The Yorkshire Times writer Graham Clark dubbed Wonder Days a \\"fine return to form\\", highlighting songs including \\"Wonder Days\\", \\"When the Music Played\\", \\"The Thing I Want\\" and \\"Serpentine\\". Chris Chantler of TeamRock selected \\"The Thing I Want\\" as one of six \\"tracks of the week\\" on 6 March 2015, Classic Rock highlighted \\"Resurrection Day\\" in a similar feature later in the month, and at the end of the year Wonder Days was selected by the magazine as the 11th best album of the year.

The comet was initially spotted on a photographic plate by Richard M. West at the European Southern Observatory Sky Atlas Laboratory, Geneva in January 1975, when it had a brightness of magnitude 12. Inability to predict its movement from a single image meant the comet had to be presumed lost. In late February it was accidentally rediscovered by Lubos Kohoutek at the Hamburg Observatory, Germany and independently on 1 March by Toshihiko Ikemura in Shinshiro, Japan. After further observations the comets parabolic orbit was computed, which gave a perihelion date of 23 March 1975 and proved that all three sightings were of the same object, which was accordingly designated 76P/West–Kohoutek–Ikemura. Further calculations by Brian G. Marsden determined the comet's elliptical orbit and revealed that it had passed only 0.012 AU from Jupiter on 22 March 1972. This close approach had reduced its orbital frequency from some 30 years to the current 6.48 years and its perihelion distance from 4.78 AU to 1.60 AU.

Life Carl was born in Vienna on 11 December 1847 to George Ludolph Griesbach. He studied at the University of Vienna and worked with the Geological Survey of Vienna. He joined a German expedition to East Africa in 1869-70 and returned to live in London. He wrote on the geology of Natal, with numerous illustrations made by himself. In 1878 he joined the Geological Survey of India in Calcutta. He was part of the Afghan Boundary Commission between 1884 and 1886. For his work during this period, he was created C.I.E. in February 1887 and awarded the Afghan medal and clasp. He succeeded William King as Director of the Geological Survey of India in 1894. Griesbach discovered fossils of the ammonoid Otoceras which he suggested as marking the earliest Triassic period thus marking the boundary of the Permian and the Triassic. The term Griesbachian is sometimes applied to strata belonging to this early period. Griesbach described what he called the Haimanta System, a series of rocks made of quartz, slate and conglomerate in a layer over the Vaikrita system in the central Himalayas of Kumaon. Griesbach was elected Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1874. He married his cousin Emma, daughter of the Reverend W.R. Griesbach, in 1869. They had a daughter and a son and following Emma's death in 1892, Griesbach lived in Graz, Austria, with his daughter. He died on 13 April 1907. In recognition of his work, Tim Tozer of the Geological Survey of Canada named a creek on northwest Axel Heiberg Island (Canadian High Arctic) after him, and subsequently defined the Early Triassic sub-stage of Griesbachian time at that site.

It is a synthetic woody odorant and is used as a fragrance ingredient in perfumes, laundry products and cosmetics.  Odour  OTNE has a woody, floral, ambergris odour.Iso E Super Its odour is long- lasting on skin and fabric.http://whatmenshouldsmelllike.com/2011/04/10/iso-e- super/http://www.fragrantica.com/notes/Iso-E-Super-422.html  Uses  Iso E Super is a very common perfume ingredient, providing a sandalwood-like and cedarwood-like fragrance, in soap, shampoo, perfumes, detergents, fabric fresheners, antiperspirants or deodorants, and air fresheners. It is also used as a tobacco flavoring (at 200–2000 ppm), as a plasticizer and as a precursor for the delivery of organoleptic and antimicrobial compounds.  Production  Iso E Super is produced commercially by Diels–Alder reaction of myrcene with 3-methyl-3-penten-2-one in the presence of aluminium chloride to give a monocyclic intermediate that is cyclized in the presence of 85% phosphoric acid. Synthesis Carrying out the initial Diels–Alder reaction using a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum chloride appears to ensure that the acetyl group is at position 2 of the resulting cyclohexene adduct, which distinguished Iso E Super from other (previously patented) fragrances based on tetramethylacetyloctaline. The second cyclization reaction yields a mixture of diastereomers with the general structure depicted above, the predominant ones being (2R,3R) and (2S,3S).  Chemical Summary  OTNE is the abbreviation for the fragrance material with Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) numbers 68155-66-8, 54464-57-2 and 68155-67-9 and EC List number 915-730-3. It is a multi-constituent isomer mixture containing: *1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)ethan-1-one (CAS 54464-57-2) *1-(1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)ethan-1-one (CAS 68155-66-8) *1-(1,2,3,4,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-2,3,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthyl)ethan-1-one (CAS 68155-67-9) All isomers conform to the chemical formula C16H26O and have a molecular weight of 234.4 g/mol.  Physical-chemical properties  OTNE is a clear yellow liquid at 20 °C. Its melting point is below −20 °C at atmospheric pressure, and its boiling point is determined to be at around 290 °C (modified OECD 103 method). All physicochemical data have been obtained from the OTNE REACH registration dossier.OTNE REACH Registration Dossier  Safety  Iso E Super may cause allergic reactions detectable by patch tests in humans and chronic exposure to Iso E Super from perfumes may result in permanent hypersensitivity. In a study with female mice, Iso E Super was positive in the local lymph node assay (LLNA) and irritancy assay (IRR), but negative in the mouse ear swelling test (MEST). No data were available regarding chemical disposition, metabolism, or toxicokinetics; acute, short-term, subchronic, or chronic toxicity; synergistic or antagonistic activity; reproductive or teratological effects; carcinogenicity; genotoxicity; or immunotoxicity. The International Fragrance Association (IFRA) has published safe use levels for Iso E Super in consumer products.http://www.ifraorg.org/en-us/standards- library/s/OTNE OTNE is not toxic and not a CMR substance.NTP reports OTNE is classified as a skin irritant (R38 EU DSD, H315 EU CLP) and is positive in the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA – OECD 429) and therefore classified as a skin sensitiser (R43 EU DSD, H317 EU CLP), though OTNE lacks any structural alerts for sensitisation in in silico prediction models (DEREK) and is not identified as an allergen in in vivo Human Repeated Patch Tests. Several health related studies have been conducted on OTNE, and based on these studies, OTNE has been determined to be safe under the current conditions of use. Given the sensitization classification of OTNE, and its use in fragrances, the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) has published safe use levels for OTNE in consumer products, which have been in effect since August 2009.IFRA OTNE standard  Environmental data  OTNE is classified as H410 Very toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects (EU-CLP) or R51/53 Toxic to aquatic organisms, may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment (EU DSD). The biodegradation of OTNE in fresh water (T1/2) is at most 40 days, and at most 120 days in sediment (OECD 314 test), though the biodegradation within the 28day window was around 11% (OECD 301-C). Given the outcome of the OECD 314 test OTNE does not meet the criteria for “Persistent” (P) or “very Persistent” (vP). The measured Bio Concentration Factor (BCF) is 391 l/kg, which is well below the EU limit of 2000 and US limit of 1000 for Bioaccumulation (B) classification. The LogKow for OTNE has been measured to be 5.65. OTNE is therefore not classified as a PBT or vPvB substance for the EU or any other global criteria. OTNE has been detected in surface water at levels of 29–180 ng/l, These values are well below the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) and as a result the overall environmental risk ratio (also referred to as RCR or PEC/PNECS) is determined to be below 1.  Regulatory status  OTNE is registered on all major chemical inventories (US, Japan, China, Korea, Philippines, and Australia) and has been EU REACH registered in 2010. In 2014 the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a 13-week repeat dose toxicity study and found no adverse effects.http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/testing/status/agents/ts-m990091.html OTNE has been recommended for inclusion in an update for the EU Fragrance Allergens labelling for cosmetic products based on a small number of positive reactions in dermatological clinics of around 0.2% to 1.7% of patients tested in three studies If the proposed SCCS Opinion is taken forward into legislation then OTNE will be labelled on cosmetic products in the EU, several years after publication of a new legislation.  List of products containing Iso E Super  * The fragrance Molecule 01 (Escentric Molecules, 2005) is a specific isomer of Iso E Super, by the company IFF.

He served as commander of the 208th Motorized Division, and organized and commanded Soviet partisans in the Klichaw region of occupied Belarus from late 1941 to 1942. Arrested in Moscow in May 1943 and held in the Lubyanka, he died in prison there after a hunger strike.  Early life, revolution, and Russian Civil War  Nichiporovich was born on 15 March 1900 in Bogorodskoye, Moscow Governorate. He joined the Red Guards troop (druzhina) of the Moscow Post Office in October 1917 during the October Revolution and participated in fighting against Junkers during the Moscow Bolshevik Uprising while taking control of the posts, telegraph, customs, and telephone exchanges in Moscow. The troop was incorporated into the 96th Rifle Battalion of the Red Army 1st Moscow Workers' Regiment in December 1918 and sent to the Eastern Front, where it fought against the White forces of Alexander Kolchak in Vyatka Governorate during the Russian Civil War. The battalion fought against the detachments of Alexander Dutov at Sterlitamak in 1919. Nichiporovich was appointed platoon commander in February 1920 and became assistant regimental adjutant in November.  Interwar period  From July 1921, Nichiporovich successively served as a machine gun platoon commander, assistant regimental adjutant, regimental adjutant, and assistant regimental chief of staff in the newly formed 1st Rifle Regiment. He studied at the cavalry department of the 6th Combined Tatar-Bashkir Military School in Kazan from October 1922, and transferred to the 39th Cavalry Regiment of the 7th Cavalry Division in the Western Military District (the Belorussian Military District from October 1926) upon his graduation two years later. With the regiment, Nichiporovich successively served as commander of cavalry and regimental school platoons, and assistant regimental chief of staff. In January 1927 he took command of a cavalry squadron of the 40th Cavalry Regiment, and from May 1929 Nichiporovich led the separate cavalry squadron of the 5th Rifle Division. He studied at the Red Banner Cavalry Commander's Refresher Courses (KUKS) in Novocherkassk from November 1930, and became assistant commander of the 39th Regiment after his May 1931 graduation. After commanding the 94th Cavalry Regiment of the 24th Cavalry Division from June 1935, he became commander of the 39th Regiment in January 1938. Arrested by the NKVD during the Great Purge on 7 March, Nichiporovich was investigated and dismissed from the army. In December he was released from arrest after the end of the case and on 19 February 1939 he was reinstated in the army at the disposal of its Personnel Directorate. Nichiporovich was appointed commander of the 144th Cavalry Regiment of the 36th Cavalry Division in the Belorussian Special Military District in March, and made it the best in the division, for which it received a Red Banner after combat training. He transferred to command the 14th Motorized Machine Gun Artillery Brigade in November 1940, which was expanded into the 208th Motorized Division of the 13th Mechanized Corps of the 10th Army in the Western Special Military District in March 1941.  World War II  Shortly after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June, the army became part of the Western Front. The 208th and its corps were positioned south of Białystok and as a result bore the brunt of the German attacks, and were encircled by the German troops. Nichiporovich formed the remnants of his division into a partisan detachment and subsequently received the Order of Lenin on 15 July 1942 for the \\"successful combat actions of the detachment behind enemy lines\\" and his \\"personal courage.\\" He was evacuated to Moscow and was at the disposal of the Central Headquarters of the Partisan Movement from October 1942.

The Chinese Mayoralty was the highest-ranking, Chinese government position in the East Indies with considerable political and judicial jurisdiction over the colony's Chinese subjects. The Batavian Mayoralty was one of the oldest public institutions in the Dutch colonial empire, perhaps second only in antiquity to the viceregal post of Governor- General of the Dutch East Indies. Family and background Khouw Kim An Sia was born in Batavia in 1875 to the ninth concubine of his father, Khouw Tjeng Tjoan, Luitenant-titulair der Chinezen (died in 1880). Khouw's father and uncles, Khouw Tjeng Kee and Khouw Tjeng Po, were the sons of the late eighteenth-century magnate, Khouw Tian Sek (died in 1843), patriarch of the Khouw family of Tamboen, arguably the richest dynasty in Batavia among the Cabang Atas aristocracy of colonial Java. The Chinese lieutenancies of Khouw's father, uncles and grandfather were honorary appointments without any of the entailed governmental authority. As the son and grandson of Chinese officieren ('Chinese officers'), Khouw Kim An was born with the hereditary title of Sia. Portrait of Majoor Khouw Kim An's grandsons, Yan and Coen (by Charles Sayers, circa 1937). Khouw Kim An Sia received a traditional Chinese education grounded in the Chinese Classics, and acquired a good grasp of both Mandarin and Hokkien in addition to his native Batavian Malay. He was also instructed by private tutors in European languages, including Dutch which he spoke fluently. The future Majoor's Chinese training, however, stands in sharp contrast to the Dutch education of many in his increasingly westernised social class and generation, most obviously exemplified by his cousin, the naturalised Dutchman and philanthropist O. G. Khouw. This familiarity with Chinese culture gave him a distinct, and by then rare, advantage in his career as the head and public face of the Chinese in the colony. At the age of 18, Khouw married Phoa Tji Nio, the daughter and heiress of an influential community leader, Phoa Keng Hek Sia, founder of the influential educational and community organisation Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan. Khouw's wife was also the granddaughter of Phoa Tjeng Tjoan, Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg (now Bogor). The two families already had significant ties. Since 1886, Khouw's older brother, Khouw Kim Tjiang, had served as der Chinezen of Buitenzorg, and would eventually succeed Khouw's grandfather-in-law as Kapitein. Khouw's cousin, O. G. Khouw, also served as Vice-President to Khouw's father-in-law, Phoa Keng Hek Sia, in the latter's capacity as the founding President of Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan. Khouw himself would later play an important role in his father- in-law's organisation. The newly married couple lived in Buitenzorg, where both bride and groom already had significant family ties. The marriage produced four sons and two daughters. Khouw Kim An Sia and his family remained in Buitenzorg until they inherited Candra Naya, one of Batavia's grandest historic mansions, from Khouw's cousin, Khouw Yauw Kie, a Kapitein der Chinezen in the Chinese Council of Batavia (Dutch: Chinese Raad; Hokkien: Kong Koan). Chinese mayoralty Majoor Khouw Kim An (right) with a European guest. Volksraad. In 1905, Khouw was raised to the post of der Chinezen with a seat on the Chinese Council of Batavia. In 1907, Tio Tek Ho, 4th Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia resigned. The former Majoor was seen as a reactionary traditionalist; and many in the Dutch government and Batavia's Chinese community desired a change of direction in the governance of the Chinese community. Following extensive consultations with Khouw's influential father- in-law, Phoa Keng Hek, the Dutch government decided to appoint Khouw as eventual successor to Majoor Tio Tek Ho. Tradition, however, demanded that only Kapiteins could be considered for elevation to the Mayoralty. Khouw, who was still a , was quickly raised to the rank of Kapitein in 1908 before his final appointment in 1910 as the fifth and last Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia. His elevation, while seen as a progressive appointment, nonetheless took place thanks to the influence and family background of both the new Majoor and his wife. As Majoor and head of the Chinese community, Khouw also acted as the ex officio Chair of the Chinese Council of Batavia, and part of the Volksraad (or colonial legislative assembly) of the Dutch East Indies. He maintained close relations with other Chinese members of the Volksraad, such as Hok Hoei Kan and Loa Sek Hie. In 1918, all Chinese officers, including Khouw, were relieved of their office as part of the government's review of the role of the Chinese officership in the colonial administration. Many community activists had criticised the system of governance by Chinese officers, or 'Indirect Rule', as an archaic relic of feudalism. Khouw, however, remained in the government's good books, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1920. Finally, in 1927, Khouw − but not the other Chinese officers − was restored to the Chinese Mayoralty of Batavia, probably thanks to the antiquity and, therefore, the historic and symbolic value of the institution Khouw represented. By then, a lot of the political and legal powers of the Chinese Mayoralty had devolved upon the colonial civil service. Many of the duties of the last Majoor were, consequently, ceremonial in nature. While on a visit to The Netherlands in 1927, he was received formally at Court by Queen Wilhelmina, and conveyed to the Sovereign the loyal greetings of the Chinese community of the Dutch East Indies. The Majoor celebrated his Silver Jubilee as Chinese Officier on February 10, 1930, on which occasion the Queen conferred upon him the Great Gold Star for Loyalty and Merit (Groote Gouden Ster voor Trouw en Verdienste) in recognition of his long service to the Crown. It was the highest grade, awarded only to the most eminent native chiefs, in what was seen as the colonial counterpart of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. Second World War and death During the Second World War, the Japanese invaded and occupied the Dutch East Indies. In 1942, Majoor Khouw Kim An was apprehended by the Japanese and imprisoned with other leaders of the Dutch colonial government in Tjimahi. He died in prison on February 13, 1945. His remains were buried near the famous mausoleum of his cousin, O. G. Khouw, in Petamburan.

The blusas assemble in groups called cuadrillas and their main role is to provide entertainment at these events.  Etymology  Etymologically, blusas comes from the Basque language and refers to the typical blouse worn at festivities. However, this word was a loanword from the Spanish blusa which describes the clothes worn in the countryside by farmers. It was also a loanword from the French blouse which itself had a German origin.  History  Celedón The festivities in Vitoria-Gasteiz have a rural origin. Throughout history they have been developed in accordance with the population. Even though the beginning of the blusas tradition is pretty unknown, it is believed that it may have a direct relationship with the myth of Celedón. There are several versions of this story as the tale was passed down orally. However, two have been reckoned by the Basque traditions as the most reliable ones: # The first version tells the story of Celedonio Aizola, an outgoing bricklayer from Zalduondo. His fame came from his good people skills used in the Virgen Blanca Festivities several decades before. It is said that every time he stepped into this village, he made all the inhabitants gather in order to party with him. Later, in 1975, some friends of his came up with an idea to hang an artificial figure which resembled Celedonio so as to make the Vitoria's festivities start some year after the man's death. Nowadays that invention is part of the tradition. , s along the Virgen Blanca Square pushed by some ropes. # The second hypothesis is about Celedón Iturralde. A friend of his, Pedro Fernandez de Retana, who was the organist of Vitoria around the 1870s, took the role of organizing this village's festivities. This man, emphasised in telling that he was doing it as a memorial of Celedon iturralde, who died 12 year before in the Carlist Wars. In 1918, Mariano San Miguel gathered all the typical songs of the festivities into a song book, and among them, there was the one which Celedón wrote with the strophe that sounds non-stop in the festivities \\"Celedón ha hecho una casa nueva. Celedón, con ventana y balcón\\". These lines talk about the house which was made by Celedón in Bitoriano (a small village next to Vitoria) where he had a balcony and a window (said in the song several times). This emblematic character of the Basque was undoubtedly the origin of the festivities of Vitoria-Gasteiz. It is a mystery when did officially the blusas and neskas start with the tradition of dressing up but it is believed that at the very beginning, there used to be only men. However, those ancient characteristics have gradually changed up to the point that nowadays almost every cuadrilla are mixed. One curiosity could be that it is thought blusas have celebrated this tradition from its very beginning to nowadays inconstantly, but after the civil war and the time of the dictation this tradition disappeared for some years.  The \\"cuadrillas\\" in the present day  These groups are usually thought to be just the grouping of inhabitants in the festivities but it is far more than that. In fact, they give social aid by going to elderly's residences or organizing special events for children during the year. Also their brotherhood goes much further as in other festivities such as \\"San Prudencio\\" they also hang up. The cuadrillas, have the curiosity that inside them there are not real rules. Nevertheless, they do have some unwritten ones, which are given from the veterans to the freshmen. Besides, everybody has the opportunity to join these groups in exchange of some money.  Festival routine  Blusas are the main cheerleaders of festivals and thus, their routine is connected with it. Their activities could be divided into two parts: * Religious activities: consist of going to San Miguel's church and participating in the religious pilgrimage in order to give the Virgen Blanca bouquets of flowers. * Social activities: As an example, doing the famous \\"Paseillos\\" or organizing activities from the citizens. The Paseillo is called to the activity of parading across the centre of the city with a fixed route. During the parade each cuadrilla goes dancing, singing and drinking happily with the help of musicians who play \\"txarangas\\" (songs with a lively rhythm and catchy lyrics). Meanwhile, the audience stays on the edges of the road the blusas have to follow, especially young ladies, who wait for the blusas to pick them and take them to dance. The blusas give stickers which symbolise the cuadrilla they belong to, which are meant to be placed on to festival-goers clothing.  Attire  The blusas wear the typical rural attire the Araba natives once wore. The outfit consists of a shirt, a \\"blusa\\" (blouse), a pair of trousers and the \\"albarcas\\" whereas \\"neskak\\" wear a blouse, long skirt and \\"albarcas\\".

La Fosca is between Palamós and Cala S'Alguer. Throughout most of the year very few people live there, but in summer the population of La Fosca grows quickly. La Fosca is located at the northern end of a large bay, which is popular for swimming, sailing and windsurfing. The town is by-passed by the C31 which connects the coastal towns of the central Costa Brava with Girona. Palafrugell lies 8.5 km to the north and Castell-Platja d'Aro 7 km to the south. La Fosca beach is known for the enormous rock in the middle of it, which separate the beach in two beaches: La fosca beach and patja del carrer. Just in one side of the beach, there's a ruined castle called the Castle of Sant Esteve de Mar. Cala S'Alguer, Palamós  The Castle of Sant Esteve The castle of Sant Esteve The castle of Sant Esteve de Mar is a ruined castle perched atop a cliff in the town of Palamós, in Baix Empordà, between the beach of La Fosca and S'Alguer. Only some bases tower and some walls remain, and is currently surrounded by a fence that prevents access to visitors. It is accessed from a path leading from the beach of Fosca.  History  The castle was built on a Roman villa which, in turn, was probably built on an Iberian settlement. The first documents that cite the thirteenth century, when Arnau sa Bruguera, first mayor of Palamós, bought in the Cathedral of Girona in 1277 on behalf of King Peter III of Aragon; belonged to the parish of Santa Eugenia de Vilaroman. During the Middle Ages it possessed different feudal lords: Simó of Geronella, Jaume de Cornellà, Bernat Pallarés (Barcelona), his son Pere Pallarés and finally Berenguer de Cruïlles, important feudal lord of Empordà, who bought it from the previous owner Barcelona 20,000 salary.

Widdows (15 October 1871 – 11 February 1946) was an English architect who pioneered changes to school building design to enhance the health of school children. He was also responsible for the design of about 80 schools in Derbyshire, where he became Chief Architect. Biography =Early years= George H. Widdows was born Francis George Henry Widdows in 1871 in the city of Norwich. He remained in Norwich for 23 years, attending the King Edward VI School, Norwich and then training to become an architect at the office of the Cathedral's Diocesan Surveyor. To gain more experience he then spent three years with various architects around England. In 1897, he was appointed as Chief Architectural Assistant at Derby Corporation (forerunner of what is now Derby City Council). He spend 7 years there on minor building projects. In 1904 Widdows was elected an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. =Derbyshire years= In 1904, Widdows made a move that marked the start of his specialisation on school architecture. He left Derby Corporation and joined Derbyshire County Council's Education Committee as Building Surveyor. The work he did for the Education Committee obviously made an impression on the County Council because, in 1910, they appointed him as Chief Architect across all their services. The massive school building programme during the subsequent period ensured that Widdows' efforts remained focussed on schools. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1913. By the time he retired in 1936, he had designed some sixty elementary and seventeen secondary schools in Derbyshire. =Final years= Widdows designed and built his own house at Allestree near Derby and retired there in 1936. He died at his home in 1946, aged 74. School building design To understand the pioneering work done by Widdows on school building design, it is necessary to understand the environment in which he was working. =The school building boom years= The growth in industry in the nineteenth century saw many people move around the country, particularly from rural to town areas, to gain employment. This resulted in population changes that required the building of new schools. This was particularly true in the east of Derbyshire where there had been a massive boom in the coal-mining and textile manufacturing industries in the 1890s. =Legislation affecting schools= Creation of LEAs School boards were created in boroughs and parishes under the Elementary Education Act 1870. These boards were semi- independent of the borough and parish councils. School boards were abolished by the Education Act 1902, which replaced them with local education authorities (LEAs). In the case of Derbyshire the authority was Derbyshire County Council. The 1902 Act ensured that schools now had solid financing from local ratepayers and had to meet uniform standards. This led to a rapid growth, especially of secondary schools. Child health The Education (Administrative Provisions) Act 1907 meant that schools became subject to regular medical inspections. This led to a new working partnership between the medical profession and school architects and designers. =Widdows' designs= Prior to the setting up of school boards in 1870, the mass education that took place happened in buildings not purpose-designed for children e.g. church halls. After 1870, the school boards did construct purpose-built schools to locally determined designs but these were often cramped and poorly ventilated. Once local education authorities were set up in 1902, some standardisation of school building design began to take place. In addition, at a national level, medical pressure grew to incorporate building design features to enhance child health and welfare. The first major national conference on school hygiene was held in 1904. Within Derbyshire County Council, there was a good working relationship between the Medical Officer and the Chief Architect, George Widdows. This relationship nurtured the innovative designs of Widdows. Typical health-related features of Widdows' designs included: * Spacious classrooms * Large windows, allowing natural daylight and sun to permeate the rooms * Wide internal corridors to allow the pupils to exercise (\\"drill\\") in bad weather conditions * External verandahs to allow the children to exercise in inclement weather * Ventilation from both sides of the school buildings and rooms Further characteristic features of Widdows-designed schools included: * Single storey buildings where the site permitted * Use of good (and often local) materials * Standard designs that allowed different configurations depending on school site and size * Often designed in an Arts & Crafts / neo-vernacular style Recognition =Antemortem= The advances Widdows made in school design were recognised by his contemporaries. In an article on provincial school building in 1913, The Builder periodical stated that his work \\"constitutes a revolution in the planning and arrangement of school buildings... a real advance which places English school architecture without a rival in any European country or the United States.\\" George Widdows became one of the most respected men in his profession and in 1921 read his paper on 'School Design' to the Royal Institute of British Architects. In thanking him, the Head of the Board of Education (equivalent to the Department of Education in 2015) Felix Clay said \\"No architect has done more than Mr. Widdows to develop the modern school. The whole emphasis of design has shifted. Instead of the old of compact three-storeyed central hall building we have a bewildering variety of plans from cart-wheels to L-shaped buildings, but all arranged so as to secure the maximum amount of sun and to get air into the classroom from both sides.\\" =Postmortem= George Widdows died in 1946, a year before the passing of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. This legislation was the foundation of the current heritage protection rules and its associated \\"listing\\" of historic buildings by English Heritage. Since 1975, sixteen of Widdows' schools have been designated as Listed Grade II, indicating that the buildings are nationally important and of special interest. Ilkeston School has received the higher designation of Listed Grade II*, indicating that the building is considered to be a particularly important building of more than special interest. Nikolaus Pevsner's Buildings of England is a highly respected series of architectural guides covering every English county. Pevsner's comments on Widdows buildings include \\"Also of interest [in Derbyshire] are some of the schools...those of G H Widdows...are enlightened in plan, with covered ways and large windows and always interesting in their motifs.\\" In a more recent guide to Buildings in Derbyshire, Richard Stone says \\"Widdows had radical ideas...to meet demands for higher standards of health and hygiene in education. That he was able to put these ideas into practice is testament to the confidence he inspired.\\" In 2011, English Heritage published a guide to outline the selection criteria to be used when designating education buildings. This specifically mentions Widdows, as follows: \\"As education moved away from instruction by rote, so the more ambitious authorities began to consider school buildings from the point of view of the child with issues of health and mental stimulation to the fore. A pioneer in the building of well-ventilated and less utilitarian schools was George Widdows, architect to Derbyshire Education Committee from 1904. His innovative designs, in a neo-vernacular style, with cross ventilation and a ‘marching corridor’ for exercise, proved lastingly influential.\\" Although George Widdows has now received the respect he deserves from architecture, education, health and heritage professionals, he perhaps hasn't received the same level of recognition from the wider public. As an example, in 2011, George Widdows was one of twelve historical figures selected from about 70 public nominations for getting a Derbyshire County Council blue plaque dedicated to them. However, when it came to a public vote, Widdows did not reach the final six chosen.

They were planted by Walter Hill. It is also known as Fig Tree Reserve and Plantation Reserve. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 2004.  History  The small triangular reserve at the intersection of Eagle, Elizabeth and Creek Streets was granted to the (North) Brisbane Municipal Council by Queen Victoria, signed by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Henry Wylie Norman, on 16 May 1889. It was gazetted on 17 May 1889 as, \\"745 Folio 210 101/11 perches... Reserve for Plantation, urinal etc. only and for no other purpose whatsoever... Rent: 1 peppercorn per year if demanded by the Queen Victoria and her heirs forever. Mineral Rights reserved by the Crown.\\" The land could be resumed if these conditions were not observed. Walter Hill planted the three fig trees located on the site. He was appointed Brisbane's first superintendent of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens in 1855 and remained a key figure in the management of the Gardens until 1881. Public toilets were constructed on the reserve but were removed in the 1970s. The area has been paved, and 19th-century reproduction light fittings have been installed, as well as facilities such as garbage containers and seats.  Description  The reserve is a triangular island located at the intersection of Eagle, Elizabeth and Creek Streets. The site, consisting of a partially paved and landscaped area, is dominated by the huge fig trees that provide a striking visual effect in the business precinct of the Eagle Street area. The reserve is planted with three fig trees, two White Figs (Ficus virens) and one Banyan Fig (Ficus benghalensis). The branches of the Banyan Figs are supported with prop roots that develop from the aerial roots that are produced to gather moisture from the atmosphere. The White Fig is taller than the Banyan and has pale green foliage which first appears as a shade of pink or bronze. This species is found occurring naturally in Queensland and throughout tropical Asia. There are two interpretive bronze plaques located on site. The first of the bronze plaques is mounted on a small plinth and contains an engraved inscription. The inscription describes the natural features of the site as it was in 1889, the history of the site prior to 1889 and the role it played in the commercial activities of the area. The second plaque contains a map showing the course of the creek that originally flowed through the site.  Heritage listing  Eagle Street Fig Trees was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Eagle Street Fig Trees are important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Fig Trees or \\"Plantation Reserve\\" is important because it survives as a remnant of the development of the area during the first half of the nineteenth century. Early photographs of the area show rows of horse and carts lined up to service the wharf area and adjacent warehouses. The area was established as a Reserve in the late 19th century to provide an area for the carriers to rest and refresh themselves amidst an area of high activity. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As a representative of a mid-Victorian era Reserve, the Eagle Street Fig Trees demonstrate rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Located in a busy trading precinct, the Eagle Street Fig Trees provided workmen with respite from the hectic wharf trading area. The Fig Trees have retained this function in their current setting. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Eagle Street Fig Trees have landmark value at the intersection of several major streets in Brisbane's central business district and provide shade and visual amenity.

Background The peninsula was believed to be supporting elements of the Viet Cong (VC) 38th Main Force Regiment, the 48th Local Force Battalion, P-31st Local Force Company and C-95th Sapper Company all of which posed a threat to Quảng Ngãi and allied forces in the area. The operation was planned to be the Marine Corps' largest amphibious assault since the Korean War with Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines and BLT 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines assaulting the north of the peninsula by helicopter and landing craft while the 23rd Infantry Division's Task Force Cooksey, composed of elements of the 46th Infantry Regiment and 1st Cavalry Regiment and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 2nd Division launching Operation Russell Beach to seal off the southern boundary. Operation On 12 January the Marines conducted a feint against Mộ Đức District approximately 20 km south of the operation area. At 07:00 on 13 January the Marines landed on the peninsula meeting negligible resistance. Once ashore the Marines linked up with Task Force Cooksey and then pushed east forcing the VC towards the sea. While encounters with the VC were minimal, the Marines encountered extensive networks of mines, booby-traps and fortifications. On 19 January 2/26 Marines captured 56 Vietnamese of military age, under interrogation they were found to be members of the C-95th Sapper Company. The Marines evacuated numerous civilians for screening, eventually totaling some 11,900 people. On 24 January 2/26 Marines returned to their amphibious assault ships. Following the conclusion of the assault phase, Operation Russell Beach continued with Marine combined action teams, the 46th Infantry Regiment and the ARVN 6th Regiment operating to cleanse the peninsula of VC/People's Army of Vietnam forces. Aftermath The operation concluded on 7 February. During the operation the population was largely removed from the peninsula during the assault phase and a clear and search operation was followed by the construction of new roads and hamlets.

In 1963, he won a Grammy with The New Christy Minstrels. Early years Ramos, of Filipino descent with a blend of Chinese and Spanish, was born and raised in Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii. He was born to Larry Ramos Sr. and Pat Ramos. His father operated pool halls in Honolulu, Kakaako and Kalaheo. Ramos' father taught him how to play the ukulele, learning \\"My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean\\" at the age of 4. He recalled practicing on the floor of the hotel gift shop where his mother worked and sleeping with the instrument so he could wake up and play. He won a local music contest with his sister at the age of 5, and when he was 7, Ramos played ukulele on The Arthur Godfrey Show after winning a statewide ukulele contest organized by Godfrey. That year, he also played ukulele and sang in the 1950 musical romance film Pagan Love Song starring Esther Williams after Arthur Freed heard him playing the song in Hawaii behind the counter at the gift shop where his Mother worked, although his part, singing \\"The House of Singing Bamboo\\" was cut in the final edit to shorten the run time. In the early 1950s, the family moved to Bell, California. At 13, he performed in the national tour of the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II musical The King and I, as understudy (to Patrick Adiarte) in the role of the crown prince of Thailand opposite Yul Brynner. He performed the lead role with Leonard Graves and Patricia Morison in 1955 (when the movie was being filmed) at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, Canada.https://www.facebook.com/LarryRamosflyinhawaiian/photos/a.1394038897515707.1073741829.1394014627518134/1512626455656950/?type=3&theater; Concerned that his education was inadequate, his mother withdrew him from the tour after a year and he attended Bell High School, then majored in political science at East Los Angeles College and Cerritos College. Career =The New Christy Minstrels= He joined The New Christy Minstrels, an American folk music group, in 1962. The group served as a backup band on The Andy Williams Show. At the audition, he noted he was \\"the only brown kid in the group\\" and he did not hear back from them for a few weeks. When they called him back, they said the delay resulted from clearing him with the show's producers, as he would be the only non-white in the group. Ramos settled into a role providing vocals and playing banjo as well as other stringed instruments. He was noted as being \\"one of the more popular ones\\" as he \\"stood out like a sore thumb.\\" They recorded their 1962 debut album, Presenting The New Christy Minstrels, which subsequently won a 1963 Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Chorus. Ramos toured almost every day for three years after joining the group. While on tour, he met and married his wife, originally from Grangeville, Idaho, in Reno, Nevada. He was there the day his wife delivered twin daughters, but did not see his family again until the girls were aged six months, prompting him to quit the group in January 1966 because he \\"wanted to watch his children grow up.\\" The producers of the group vowed he would never work in music again. =The Association= After quitting The New Christy Minstrels, Ramos worked as a studio musician and back-up singer, releasing a solo single in 1966, \\"It'll Take A Little Time\\" (later collected in the 2002 album Anthology: Just The Right Sound by The Association). In 1967, a member of The Association asked Ramos to join the band because their lead guitarist, Jules Gary Alexander, was planning to leave the group for a spiritual pilgrimage to India. According to Ramos, he went to watch the band while they were touring in the San Francisco Bay Area to get a feel for their music, but after the bass player, Brian Cole, injured his fingers in a firecracker accident, Alexander asked Ramos to go on as the lead guitarist with a few hours' notice. Ramos recalled he learned the chords after listening to the band's two albums for two hours. Later that year, Ramos performed with the band at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. While he was with The Association, he recorded five studio albums and several singles. Most notably, Ramos contributed his voice to the hit singles \\"Windy\\" (lead vocals by Russ Giguere and Ramos) and \\"Never My Love\\" (lead vocals by Terry Kirkman and Ramos) from The Association's first studio album with Ramos, the gold-selling Insight Out.

He traversed the overland route four times between 1850 and 1859, returning by sea on his first three trips. After his fourth and final trip to California he remained there, settling in Solano County and later in Sonoma County. His first diary, Incidents of Travel to California Across the Great Plains, was published in 1856. His second diary, Journal of John Udell, Kept During a Trip Across the Plains, was first published in 1859 and is an account of his last trip to California as a member of the Rose-Baley Party. Early years and marriage Modern accounts of John Udell's early life are based on his autobiographical sketch published in 1856 as part of Incidents of Travel to California Across the Great Plains and summarized in Lyle H. Wright's introduction to the 1946 edition of Udell's second diary, Journal of John Udell, Kept During a Trip Across the Plains. Born in New York City, he was the eldest of Phebe (née Bailey) and John Udell's 13 children. According to Udell, his great-grandfather Lionel had been a physician and innkeeper in Exeter, England. He emigrated to the United States in the late 17th century, settling in Stonington, Connecticut where he continued to practice as a physician. Udell's grandfather (also named John) had a shipping business in Stephentown, New York, but after his death, his business partners \\"absconded\\" with the company's cash, leaving large debts to be paid by Udell's father. For a while his father, who had previously worked as a merchant seaman out of New York, ran a sloop on the Hudson River belonging to the Schermerhorn family. The young John Udell served as the cook and cabin-boy.Wright, Lyle H. (1946). \\"Introduction\\". Journal of John Udell, Kept During a Trip Across the Plains, pp. ix–xvii. N. A. Kovach 19th-century depiction of Ashtabula County, Ohio where John and Emily Udell spent much of their married life In 1810, Udell's father moved the family to the wilderness of northeastern Pennsylvania where he took up farming. It was in Pennsylvania that Udell became a Baptist. He would remain a devout member of the faith until his death, preaching to small gatherings and once marrying a couple on one of his westward wagon trains. However, according to Lyle Wright, there is no evidence that he was ever formally trained or ordained as a minister. The Udell family found it difficult to make a living from the farm in Pennsylvania and in early 1816, John Udell travelled to Ohio to seek a new home for his parents, eventually settling the family in New Lyme. There he married Emily Merrill in December 1816. She was born in Connecticut, as were most of the early settlers of the town. In the ensuing years, Udell and his wife moved many times as he tried his hand at farming and business in a variety of locations in Ohio and Missouri. He had a large family to support. He and Emily eventually had four sons and four daughters, and he often supplemented his income by working as a travelling salesman or as a day-laborer for other farmers. In 1819 on the advice of a neighbor, he even took up distilling whiskey from his surplus grain. He then ran his own stills for another three years but later wrote of his decision to enter the distillery business: > I consented to do so; which was a great error in me; though at that time, > making and using whiskey, as a common drink, was very popular thro'out the > United States. But now I think that making and vending so much to intoxicate > men was wrong, and especially reprehensible in a Christian.Udell, John > (1856). Incidents of Travel to California Across the Great Plains, pp. > 140–141. Ashtabula Sentinel. Online extracts retrieved via olivercowdery.com > 26 February 2015. Even before his transcontinental journeys, Udell had been an inveterate traveller. In 1818, shortly after the birth of his first child, he walked 500 miles from Ohio to upstate New York in search of higher-paid work, travelling via Niagara Falls, Lake Ontario, the Genesee Falls, and Canandaigua Lake. The trip proved unsuccessful. According to Udell, he had to sell his clothes at Canandaigua to buy enough food for his return journey to Ohio which he walked at a pace of 40 miles a day.Udell (1856) pp. 138–139 Travels to California Inscription Rock in New Mexico where Udell carved his name on 8 July 1858 during his fourth overland journey from Missouri to California Udell made his first overland trip to California in 1850 to seek his fortune in the Gold Rush. His sons, Oliver and Henry (by that time young men), accompanied him. When Udell returned to Ohio after failing to make any money as a miner, they remained in California eventually settling in Allendale, a small town in Solano County.Bowen, Jerry (28 July 2002). \\"Pioneers took the road less traveled\\". Vacaville Reporter. Retrieved 25 February 2015. As with his next two trips, Udell had travelled outward on the California Trail and had travelled part of the way back by sea rather than retracing the overland route. His second and third trips to California were in 1852 and 1854. They were no more successful financially than the first one had been. He had to support himself there with a series of odd jobs. In 1856, a year after his arrival back in Ohio, he published his first diary, Incidents of Travel to California Across the Great Plains, which detailed the 1850, 1852, and 1854 journeys.Wagner, Henry Raup (1921). \\"Udell, John\\". The Plains and the Rockies; A Bibliography of Original Narratives of Travel and Adventure, 1800-1865, pp. 133-134. J. Howell Udell undertook his final overland journey to California in 1858. This time he travelled with his wife Emily. They were in their mid-60s and the intention was to stay in California permanently, living out their old age near their sons Oliver and Henry. They began their journey in Missouri travelling via the Santa Fe Trail. They joined the Rose-Baley Party, which was the first emigrant party to attempt the final stretch to California via Beale's Wagon Road, at the time little more than a rough trail. In July the party camped near Inscription Rock (now El Morro National Monument) in New Mexico. Several members of the party, including Leonard Rose, Gillum Baley, and Udell, carved their names into the stone. Their inscriptions can still be seen today.Weigle, Marta and White, Peter (2003). The Lore of New Mexico, p. 56. University of New Mexico Press On 30 August, as the emigrants were preparing to cross the Colorado River, the first of the party's wagons to arrive at the crossing were attacked by Mojave Indians, leaving twelve emigrants wounded and eight dead, including five children. Having lost most of their livestock and fearful of further attacks, the party decided to trek the 500 miles back to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Udell wrote in his diary on 31 August 1858: Journal of John Udell, Kept During a Trip Across the Plains (1868 cover) > I was in the worst situation of anyone in the company who had a family, my > wife being 65 years of age and so feeble that she was not able to walk, and > I had not an ox or hoof left, except an Indian pony which I had kept at my > wagon and he was so worn down he could scarcely travel. [...] There was not > half enough provision in the company to sustain us until we could reach > white settlements so that in all probability we must all perish by the hands > of merciless savages or by starvation. [...] Indeed, I almost envied the lot > of those of our comrades who were left dead behind us, their lifeless bodies > to be burned by the savage foe, as is the custom of those Indians.Bowen, > Jerry (25 August 2002). \\"A perilous wagon-train trip west\\". Vacaville > Reporter. Retrieved 25 February 2015. Later years Udell and his wife made it safely to Albuquerque in November 1858 despite the extreme hardships of the trek back. He managed to get a job there taking care of the US Army's livestock, and the following spring he and his wife set out again for California. This time they travelled with Edward Beale's road construction party. The couple finally arrived in Los Angeles in June 1859. They took a boat to San Francisco and then made their way to Solano County to join their sons. Later that year, the Solano County Herald published Udell's diary of his journey with the Rose-Baley Party and its aftermath. Emily Udell died in 1868 and is buried in Dixon Cemetery in Solano County. John remarried in 1871 to Clarinda Anderson and moved to Healdsburg in Sonoma County. He died three years later at the age of 79. According to Charles W. Baley in his 2002 book Disaster at the Colorado, Udell's name does not appear in the records of either Solano or Sonoma County after 1872, and his exact place of death is unknown. He is buried in Paskenta Cemetery in Tehama County, California where one of his daughters was living at the time of his death.Baley, Charles W. (2002). Disaster at the Colorado: Beale's Wagon Road and the First Emigrant Party, pp. 43; 147. Utah State University Press. Udell appears as a character in the 1995 children's novel Sallie Fox: The Story of a Pioneer Girl. The book, based in part on Udell's second diary, is a semi- fictionalized biography of Sallie Fox who as a twelve-year-old child had travelled with the Rose-Baley Party. She survived both the Mojave attack which killed her stepfather and the trek back to Albuquerque during which her half- brother died. Like John and Emily Udell, she and her remaining family eventually reached California in 1859.Collier, Amy (3 December 1995). \\"Book on Sallie Fox relives life in Mojave County as pioneer\\".

It is one of the romance sagas which were inspired by Continental romances. It survives only fragmentarily, though there are rímur which preserve the full story.Kalinke and Mitchell 1985 p54 Finnur Jónsson links this saga to Hálfdanar saga Eysteinssonar.Schröder 1917 p81 However, there is evidence to suggest otherwise as Schröder argues the opposite and suggests that they are very different in nature. He calls this saga 'a purely literary romance novel',Schröder 1917 p82 contrasting with Hálfdanar saga because of the latter's old fairy-tale tone.

During a prolonged absence by Hringr, Brynhildr is > married to Tryggvi, King of Saxland, however, in return for his assistance > in defeating another suitor.

When a > disloyal follower kills Tryggvi, Brynveig dies of grief, and Hringr avenges > Tryggvi. The tale ends with the wedding of Hringr and Brynhildr.Kalinke and > Mitchell 1985 p54 We also know that Hertryggr (Garðariki), a contemporary king, wanted to oppose one of the suitors for his daughter, a Viking known as Harekr, who appears as a savior and member of the social elite however not the Saxon king, who was the Tryggvi mentioned in this saga. Tryggvi declared himself ready to help Hertyggr if he gets his daughter Brynhildr in return, Who at this point is already engaged to John Hringr. Since it was her fathers will and she was desperate to get rid of Harekr, she promised him, and Tryggvi defeated the Harekr the Viking. When he calls Brynhildr, he learns Hringr is on his was back to Saxland - On Hringr's return journey he tells another Icelander, Eirikr, that he wants Tryggvi dead.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built from 1883 to 1884. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Transcontinental Hotel, circa 1929 The Transcontinental Hotel was constructed in 1883-4. In 1879 Peter Murphy, wine and spirit merchant, leased premises in George Street from Francois Boudin. In 1881 he acquired the adjoining vacant land. On 28 August 1883 Peter Murphy, then publican and lessee of the Burgundy Hotel, businessman, financier of MacDonnell & East (1901) and Member of the Queensland Legislative Council (MLC, 1904-1922), announced by public notice in The Telegraph his intention to apply for a new publican's license and to build a new hotel on this site. Intended to accommodate passengers from the nearby railway, the Transcontinental Hotel was to comprise \\"16 bedrooms, 1 dining room, 1 luncheon room, 1 billiard room, 4 sitting rooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, store, pantry, cellar and outhouses\\". On 22 September 1883 renowned architect Francis Drummond Greville (FDG) Stanley called tenders for the erection of a first class hotel for Peter Murphy. The new hotel, with a frontage of and a depth of , was four storeys high, one of which was below street level. The Brisbane Courier reported that the Transcontinental Hotel contained 27 bedrooms, seven public rooms, billiard room and a private bar. A sunshade of \\"ornamental design\\" was attached to the front and the two upper storeys had balconies four feet, six inches wide, with \\"ornamental iron columns, brackets, frieze and railings\\". The hotel offered comfortable accommodation, a first class table, with \\"all the delicacies of the season being provided\\". The bar trade was one of the largest in Brisbane, with only the best liquor carried. In the 1880s, George Street contained most of Brisbane's inner city first- class hotels, including the Bellevue Hotel (1886), Cosmopolitan (1887), Shakespeare (1887–88), Treasury Hotel (1887-88), Criterion (), Imperial (1885-6), Lennon's (1883-4), Grosvenor Hotel (), New Crown (188?) and the Transcontinental (1883-4). Of these, the Treasury, Grosvenor and Transcontinental are the only three to have survived. Denis O'Connor, 1906 In 1906 new lessee Denis O'Connor commissioned architect, George Henry Male Addison to design extensive alterations to the interior. At the opening ceremony of the new bar on 30 October 1906 the Transcontinental was declared to be \\"the most ornate and best equipped\\" hotel in Australia. In 1925 the hotel was further remodelled as part of Peter Murphy's redevelopment plans for upper George Street as a commercial precinct. Murphy's business acumen was realised by 1926 when upper George Street was declared to be \\"one of the most flourishing business\\" sectors outside of Queen Street and Fortitude Valley. The Murphy family owned the Transcontinental Hotel until 1935 when it was sold to Castlemaine Perkins. The McCoy family were licensees from the 1930s until the 1980s. In 1988 the hotel owners, Austotel, commissioned Hampton Interiors to restore the Transcontinental. The ornate cast iron balustrading which was removed in 1965, was reinstated and the original exterior colours were repainted.  Description  This Victorian era hotel located near the intersection of George and Roma Streets features filigree cast iron lacework that has recently been reinstated onto the original cast iron verandah posts. It is of rendered brick construction with three storeys on the George Street facade and a fourth level basement. The basement walls are Brisbane Tuff stonework. The George Street facade has a post supported curved corrugated iron awning over the footpath, and balconies on the upper two levels. Eight pairs of French-lights open onto the balconies on each level. The first floor is emphasised by having a greater balcony height than the top floor. The topmost balcony has a curved corrugated iron roof hipped at the ends. The building is crowned with a decorative parapet which includes the name \\"TRANSCONTINENTAL HOTEL\\" in raised lettering and a curved central parapet section bearing the date 1884 in a circular recess. Although the building has been restored externally, its internal refurbishment, involving the removal of fittings and the creation of a large internal space, does not convey the impression of a Victorian Hotel. Its prominent location and the intact nature of its external Victorian detailing make this building a notable landmark in this area of Brisbane.  Heritage listing  Transcontinental Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Built near Roma Street railway station, the Transcontinental Hotel is important in illustrating the important role of hotels in providing accommodation for Queensland travellers in the late 19th century. It also provides rare surviving evidence of the former importance of George Street as a late 19th century accommodation precinct. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Transcontinental is a typical example of an 1880s era boom era hotel in Brisbane's central business district, displaying filigree cast iron lacework and a post supported street awning. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It has aesthetic significance as a prominent part of the streetscape at the intersection of George and Roma Streets. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Transcontinental Hotel is significant for its strong association with Peter Murphy, Member of the Legislative Council, publican and George Street property speculator, from 1881 until 1925.

Arkoun's book has been cited in a number of scholarly sources for providing a contemporary understanding of the development of Islamic philosophy and its effects in the Muslim world. Rethinking Islam discusses a range of topics including the various ways in which Islamic ideas have been interpreted over time and the perspective of developments in Islamic countries from their own point of view. A New York Times review called the book \\"an illustration of the contemporary fecundity of Islam\\" and called Arkoun \\"the leading French-language spokesman calling for a rethinking of Islam in a modern mode.\\"\\"Mohammed Arkoun and the modernization of Islam.\\" Dialogues on Civilization. Thursday, 23 November, 2006. Content =Thought and meaning= In his work, Arkoun writes on the subject of thought and meaning. He declared there are three categories of thought. He labels these categories as 'thinkable', 'unthinkable' and 'unthought'.Hassan, Riaz. \\"Globalisation's challenge to the Islamic Ummah.\\" Asian Journal of Social Science 34, no. 2 (2006): 311-323. Arkoun taught that meaning is generated by semantic creativity, the inventiveness of a subject especially while under the pressure of new and unfamiliar existential demands that necessitate destroying, transforming, or surpassing previous meanings.Harrison, Victoria S. \\"Hermeneutics, religious language and the Qur'an.\\" Islam and Christian–Muslim Relations 21, no. 3 (2010): 207-220. =Human rights in Islamic society= Arkoun was of the view that Islamic thought had always included a discourse on the rights of God (either public or collective rights) and the rights of man (essentially individual rights), with the former having priority over the latter.Suhaila, Nik Salida, Nik Saleh, Wan Abdul Fattah, and Wan Ismail. \\"Feminist Critiques on the Theory of Rights in the Jurisdiction: Towards Gender Equality.\\" =Islamic philosophical and political development= In Rethinking Islam, Arkoun argues for a concise understanding Islamic development in modern times and attempts to deconstruct the popular western misrepresentations. He argues: \\"Islamic culture, in fact, is not reducible to the stereotypes articulated by the Christian religion and European cultures ever since the thirteenth century.\\"Hamel, Chouki El. \\"Muslim diaspora in Western Europe: The Islamic headscarf (hijab), the media and Muslims' integration in France.\\" Citizenship Studies 6, no. 3 (2002): 293-308. Arkoun argues that \\"Mediterranean thinking\\" is always multiple and open, always engaged in exchange, negotiation, and dialogue between \\"influences and residues\\".Cooke, Miriam. \\"MEDITERRANEAN THINKING: FROM NETIZEN TO MEDIZEN*.\\" Geographical Review 89, no. 2 (1999): 290-300. According to Arkoun, public discussion of secular aspects embedded within a religious understanding of the universal concept of human rights was not the prime factor bringing Islamic countries in recent years to a \\"compromise position\\".Mohammadi, Ali. \\"The culture and politics of human rights in the context of Islam.\\" Islam Encountering Globalisation (2012): 111. Arkoun suggested that scholars studying the intellectual development of Islam today need to see beyond the imposed restrictions in many Middle Eastern countries on various kinds of knowledge in journalism, political studies and deviant Islamist ideologies.Spoelders, Benedicte. \\"Rethinking development and the feminist versus Islamist dichotomy.\\" Islam and Christian‐Muslim Relations 9, no. 3 (1998): 295-305. =Interpretation of Islamic texts= Arkoun admits that many fundamental changes occur in the constant interpretation of Islamic texts. He states that it is especially true of the Qur'an, which \\"has been ripped from its historical, linguistic, literary, and psychological contexts and then been continually recontextualized in various cultures and according to the ideological needs of various actors.\\"Munir, Lily Zakiyah. \\"Islam and gender: reading equality and patriarchy.\\" Islam in Southeast Asia: Political, Social and Strategic Challenges for the 21st Century 11 (2005): 191. Fundamentalist and politically inspired Islamic movements tend to reaffirm in their own theological discourse by casting their ideology in an orientalist imaging of Islam.Gülalp, Haldun. \\"Using Islam as Political Ideology Turkey in Historical Perspective.\\" Cultural Dynamics 14, no. 1 (2002): 21-39.

Work  David Ostrowski, F (A thing is a thing in a whole which it's not), 2013, Acrylic and lacquer on canvas, 95\\" x 75\\" (240 x 190cm) Ostrowski's paintings are deceptive as they initially appear devoid of any content or meaning. Ostrowski pursues \\"meaninglessness\\" and \\"worthlessness\\" in his abstract paintings, denying perfectionism in conventional oil painting, but with considered viewing, various narratives become apparent. Ostrowski's oeuvre depicts vast emptiness, apathetic discouragement, sometimes aggression, and beauty. His paintings are casualist and made using non-traditional techniques, such as spraying fast drying lacquer and are constructed using unconventional materials such as studio detritus and collaged scraps of tape and paper. Ostrowski purposely uses quick drying lacquer to prevent himself the ability to edit the works. Ostrowski has been making art since his early childhood and was creatively influenced by members of his immediate family. He is the grandson of . His early work explored representational and figurative subject matter. He eventually felt limited by representational painting and he began to make works that were more abstract and minimal. Ostrowski's work is informed by previous art historical precedents such as abstract expressionism and minimalism. He intentionally incorporates accident, error, handicap, improvisation, and spontaneity into his work. His works are typically made in a large format and display an urgent and handmade aesthetic. His style is illustrated by the works in his “F” Series paintings; such as F (A thing is a thing in a whole which it's not), which consists of hand sprayed rectangular borders along the perimeter which frame an apparent void. He often sprays the borders using black, burnt oranges, blues, acid greens or canary yellows. The “F” Series paintings are spontaneously made and purposely incorporate awkwardness, error and mistake with the objective of discovering a new type of beauty. In the ‘F’ paintings – the ‘F’ stands for Fehlermalerei or ‘failure painting’. Ostrowski's work addresses formlessness and destruction, and an impulse to devalue and ruin painting. He explores nihilistic and casualist strategies of deskilling and disorientation in order to discover new random and surprising outcomes. Ostrowski tries to consciously subvert his art historical knowledge when making a painting in order to allow for unexpected outcomes. Ostrowski's work addresses a subversive sense of Post-Minimalist apathy. Ostrowski has turned emptiness and lack of motivation into his subject matter. Ostrowski's practice questions the precedents of painting, i.e., content, composition, line, form and color. His sparse, random and uninhibited paintings challenge the definition of what constitutes a completed and successful painting. Critic JJ Charlesworth has called Ostrowski's work “endgame” painting, i.e., a process that involves discovering what, if any, marks must still be made on the canvas. Born in Cologne, Germany in 1981, where he continues to live and work, Ostrowski studied painting under Albert Oehlen at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf.

She was a central battery ship, mounting most of her armament in a central casemate. The ship, built by the Ottoman Imperial Arsenal took nearly twenty years to complete; she was laid down in December 1874, launched in 1885, and completed in 1894. Due to her lengthy construction period, she was already obsolete by the time she was launched. Her poor handling and low quality armor contributed to a short career, spent almost entirely as a stationary training ship. She was briefly activated in 1897 during the Greco-Turkish War, but she was already in bad condition just three years after she entered service, as was the rest of the ancient Ottoman fleet. The Ottomans embarked on a reconstruction program after the incident humiliated the government, but Hamidiye was in too poor a state by 1903 to warrant rebuilding, and she was accordingly decommissioned that year, placed for sale in 1909, and sold to ship breakers in 1913. Design In 1861, Abdülaziz became sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and thereafter began a construction program to strengthen the Ottoman Navy, which had incurred heavy losses during the Crimean War of 1853–1856. He ordered several ironclad warships from shipyards in Britain and France, though the program was limited by the Ottoman Empire's limited finances. Hamidiye was one of a handful of ironclads to be ordered from the Ottoman Imperial Arsenal; her design was based on preceding, British-built central battery ships, albeit reduced in scale to the size of the earlier . In addition, a protected rudder was incorporated into the hull. She was the last ironclad to be built for the Ottoman Navy; two s were ordered from Britain after Hamidiye, but both ships were purchased by the Royal Navy before completion. She was also the last central battery ship to be completed, though the German was begun after Hamidiye, she was completed before Hamidiye entered service. Lastly, she was the final ironclad of any type to carry muzzle- loading guns. =Characteristics= Hamidiye was long between perpendiculars and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . Her hulls was constructed with iron, and displaced normally. She had a crew of 350 officers and enlisted men as completed. The ship was fitted with three pole masts, and the foremast carried a single searchlight. She was equipped with torpedo nets, but the wooden booms were carried aboard the ship, rather than attached to the sides of the hull, and the nets were kept ashore. The ship was powered by a single horizontal, two-cylinder compound steam engine manufactured by Maudslay, which drove one screw propeller. This engine had originally been intended for the frigate , but had never been installed. The very lengthy construction time for the ship left the engine idle in the dockyard for some twelve years, during which time numerous components were stripped for use in other projects, so that by 1883, it had to be completely rebuilt. Steam was provided by four coal-fired box boilers manufactured by the Imperial Arsenal, which were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engine was rated at and produced a top speed of on sea trials. Hamidiye carried of coal. A supplementary sailing rig with three masts was also fitted. Hamidiye was designed to be armed with a main battery of ten 35-caliber breechloading guns manufactured by Krupp in a central casemate, firing through gun ports. These were to be supported by four 35-cal. Krupp breechloading guns and two Hotchkiss guns, the latter for defense against torpedo boats, along with two torpedo tubes. By the time she had been completed, however, she was armed with four muzzleloading Armstrong guns and ten of the 150 mm Krupp guns. The Armstrong guns were placed in each corner of the casemate, which allowed them a fairly wide arc of fire and limited capability for two of the guns to fire either directly ahead or astern. Six of the 150 mm guns were carried in the casemate on the broadside, three guns per side, and the remaining four were placed on the upper deck, two in the bow and two at the stern. The anti-torpedo boat battery was strengthened with the addition of six guns. The two 450 mm torpedo tubes were retained in deck-mounted launchers. The ship was protected with wrought iron armor plate that was manufactured at the Imperial Arsenal where the ship was built. She had a complete armored belt at the waterline, which extended above the waterline and below. The belt was thick, and tapered down to at either end of the ship. The casemate battery was protected with iron plate. The conning tower also had 178 mm thick sides on of cypress backing. Hamidiyes armor proved to be poor quality, being described in Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships as \\"very spongy and flaky\\". Service history Hamidiye was ordered from the Imperial Arsenal in 1871, originally under the name Nüsretiye, and was laid down there in December 1874. After the original Hamidiye, of the Mesudiye class, was purchased by the Royal Navy, Nüsretiye was renamed Hamidiye, in honor of Sultan Abdul Hamid I. Work proceeded at an extremely slow pace, and she was launched or on 4 January 1885 and the following day, she was found to be filling with water, the result of a missing rivet in her keel. She was finally ready for sea trials, though without her armament installed, by 1893. Fitting-out work was completed the following year, when she was commissioned into the Ottoman fleet, though she remained in the Golden Horn until 1897. By the time she entered service, she had been surpassed by the rapidly changing warship designs of the 1880s and 1890s, first by the turret ships such as the Italian type, and then by modern pre- dreadnought battleships like the British , which began to enter service the year before Hamidiye was commissioned. Moreover, Hamidiye was equipped with poor quality armor and was difficult to handle, so she was employed as a stationary training ship for torpedo boat crews. In addition, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, who had come to power in 1876 as a result of a coup in which the Navy had played a major role, distrusted the Navy and reduced its budgets to the minimum. With the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Hamidiye was mobilized into the I Squadron of the fleet. On 19 March, Hamidiye and the ironclads , , and and three torpedo boats departed the Golden Horn, bound for the Dardanelles. This was Hamidiyes first cruise since commissioning three years earlier, and she suffered severe boiler problems during the operation. The squadron stopped off Lapseki on 22 March, having lost two of the torpedo boats to unseaworthiness. The Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Hamidiye--despite the fact that she had been completed three years previously--to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy, which possessed the three modern s. On 15 April, the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe began an inspection of the Ottoman fleet, which concluded that only a handful of ships were seaworthy, and as a result, should not be used offensively. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. On 15 May, Hamidiye and the ironclads Mesudiye, Necm-i Şevket, , and Aziziye, along with several other vessels conducted a major training exercise under the supervision of von Hofe, where severe deficiencies in the level of training were revealed, particularly with the men's ability to operate the ships' guns. In September 1897, the war came to an end, and the Ottoman fleet returned to Constantinople. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers. The fleet proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed them, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work due to its weak finances. Negotiations dragged on into the early 1900s, but Hamidiye was not included in the program. Instead, Hamidiye was decommissioned in 1903; the Ottoman Navy considered rebuilding the ship that year, like many of the other ironclads, but the ship was in too poor a condition to merit reconstruction.

Summary The main storyline begins after the end of the Prometheus film and continues across different eras, such as that of Aliens, involving different characters from those seen in each film series. The comic series is divided in four mini-series related to each franchise. Each mini-series is composed of four issues. A final, double sized issue that gives closure to the main storyline was also produced. Promotional image. Plot =Fire and Stone – Prometheus= =Fire and Stone – Aliens= Set concurrently around the same time as Aliens, the narrative begins prior to the arrival of the colonial marines as seen in the film, during the Xenomorph infestation of the Hadley's Hope colony on LV-426. As the Xenomorphs ravage the colony, engineer Derrick Russell and greenhouse specialist Genevieve Dione attempt to lead other colonists to safety. To do so, they seek to acquire transportation to evacuate survivors from the surface. The survivors enlist the help of Nolan Cale, a scavenger and pilot in possession of a small freighter known as the Onager. However, the Onager is only capable of short- range flights, imposing constraints on the survivors' escape plan. While the colonists board the freighter, Cale notices several xenomorphs that manage to stow away aboard one of the ship's cargo bulkheads. However, afraid of being marooned on LV-426 should he remain behind to decouple the infested cargo bulkhead, Cale abstains from informing the survivors and gives the all-clear for the ship to depart. Because of the ship's limited flight range, the Onager lands on LV-223, a nearby planetoid within the same sector as LV-426. The survivors plan to hold out with the provisions aboard the ship and use a distress beacon to flag down rescue. However, the colonists inadvertently unlock the infested cargo bulkhead, and the concealed xenomorphs emerge, killing some of the survivors. Outmatched and helpless, the survivors are forced to abandon their supplies and flee into the nearby jungle. Over the next several weeks, the group continues to traverse the surface of LV-223, constantly being pursued by the xenomorphs. As the survivors' numbers dwindle, Dione, becoming the group's self-appointed leader, urges that they erect defenses and frequently seek safety whenever possible. However, Cale dissents and insists that the remaining survivors mount an offensive to reclaim the supplies from the Onager and kill the Xenomorphs. As Cale and Dione continue to bicker over the group's course of action, and the xenomorphs continue to whittle down the group's numbers, Russell becomes increasingly distant from the group affairs. Having stumbled upon a probe from the Prometheus expedition decades ago, Russell analyzes the data from the probe and finds that the current landscape of LV-223 has changed drastically from what it was at the time of the previous expedition. Russell deduces that the enigmatic black substance that the members of the Prometheus expedition encountered acted as a catalyst that expedited the evolution of the environment on the planet from a barren, rocky wasteland to a lush jungle setting. Russell also explores a crashed ship of the \\"Engineer\\" species encountered in the film, and finds a dormant Engineer in stasis, although much to his dismay, he is unable to wake it. Russell continues to compile his findings and stores notes and work in a cave situated within a mountain that the xenomorphs are wary of approaching. Although he reports his discoveries to the group, Russell's findings are dismissed as unimportant in comparison to the immediate goal of survival. As the group endeavors to survive by scavenging for food, a few of the members on a fishing excursion at a lake are attacked by xenomorphs. One of the survivors, Luis, is dragged beneath the lake after a scuffle with a Xenomorph and in the process, both are fused together as one organism- a product of the black substance that Russell is investigating. After Cale kills the Luis- Xenomorph hybrid, Cale is unable to withstand his emotions of guilt and confesses to the group of his role in the group's dire situation, having failed to inform them during the escape from LV-426 of the presence of xenomorphs aboard the Onager. An enraged Dione berates him for his incompetence, but Cale vows to redeem himself by leading a group of survivors to attack the xenomorphs guarding the Onager and recovering the distress transmitter. Cale and his group ultimately fail in their attempt, and during the battle, he is exposed to the black substance. The mutated Cale leads the xenomorphs back to the survivors' camp, where a massacre ensues as Dione and the last of the survivors are wiped out. Russell, now the sole remaining member of the group, continues to take refuge in his cave and focuses on his studies of the LV-223 environment. However, as the days pass, he becomes increasingly unstable and erratic from weeks of isolation, and a diagnosis from the probe reveals that he is afflicted with brain tumors. Russell also notes that the mutant Cale experiences conflict with the xenomorphs. Russell buries the deceased members of the group, but is assaulted by Cale, who Russell kills with a stake. The struggle attracts the attention of the xenomorphs, and as Russell attempts to flee, he becomes injured and is unable to reach his mountain hideout. With the xenomorphs poised for the kill, and a puddle of the black substance within reach, Russell reaches out, believing that it can save him. The narrative cuts off as the xenomorphs emit a roar, leaving Russell's fate unknown. =Fire and Stone – Alien vs. Predator= Elden follows Francis and Galgo back to the ship, unleashing the pack of xenomorphs upon the ship. Galgo gives up Francis, abandoning him for Elden to find. Amidst the chaos, a hunting party of predators shows up to hunt the xenomorphs. Galgo and his crew retreat, being unknowingly followed by one of the predators. Meanwhile, the predators encounter Elden. They shoot him, to no effect. When one attempts to tackle him, he sprouts a mouth on his stomach, and bites it. He violently kills another, prompting another predator to mark him with the blood of a xenomorph. The Predator proceeds to offer up his ritual knife as a trophy, with Elden rejecting it. Elden proceeds on his mission to find Francis. Suddenly the xenomorphs turn on Elden, nearly injuring him. One of the predators saves Elden from his attackers and lends him a weapon. The predator accidentally breaches the hull of the ship, killing itself. Elden floats back to the ship, to resume his search. Francis hides in the vents, dying of cancer. He briefly encounters Elden, but escapes. Elden later gets onto Francis's trail, when Francis springs a trap on him, taking some of his blood, in hopes it would cure him. Elden yells at him that he will feel nothing but pain, but Francis injects the blood into himself anyway. He begins to violently mutate. Meanwhile, the predator that was bitten by Elden mutates and kills a member of its hunting party. Elden and Francis encounter the creature, and fight it. They win by ripping it in half. Francis starts to die. As he dies he tells Elden that he is his legacy, and that he should do as he chooses with his eternal life. =Fire and Stone – Predator= =Fire and Stone – Omega= Background Spanning four franchises, four different comic book series and five creative teams, Fire and Stone begins with writer Paul Tobin and artist Juan Ferreyra's Prometheus: Fire and Stone four issue mini- series.

The organization was founded in 1977 and is based in St. Petersburg, Florida. History In 1977, five Florida credit unions joined together and founded PSCU. PSCU started a mobile banking platform compatible with iOS in November 2009. That same year, the company released its CardLock fraud prevention program. Mike Kelly was named CEO of the organization in 2011 after the death of former CEO and president Dave Serlo. PSCU was the first organization to issue Visa pre-paid EMV cards in August 2012. The company hosts an annual 24-hour brainstorming competition which aims to create technology for the banking community that began in 2012. PSCU announced in February 2013 that the company would be partnered with MasterCard to make the MasterPass technology available to the members of the credit union. The company chose PricewaterhouseCoopers in April 2013 to serve as an external independent certified public accounting firm for auditing and tax services for the company. In June 2013, PSCU opened a data center in Phoenix, Arizona. The organization started \\"Make Your Money Matter,\\" an online and social media campaign that educated consumers on the difference between banks and credit unions, in 2013. In February 2014, PSCU received a patent for the CardLock fraud prevention system. The initiative won an award for best website in the educational resources category at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas. By March 2015, the program covered 250 credit unions. In March 2015, Chuck Fagan, former president of the Credit Union Executive Society, was named CEO of PSCU. PSCU won a Stevie Award for Contact Center of the Year in the Financial Service Industry in 2015. PSCU partnered with Colonial Williamsburg on electronic educational programs for schools in the United States.

Registered users can then vote for these submissions. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called \\"subverses\\". The website has been described by several media outlets, including Quartz, The New York Times, New York, and the US and UK editions of Wired, as a hub for the alt-right.  Overview  Voat is a site which hosts aggregated content and discussion forums. According to Wired, Voat is \\"aesthetically and functionally similar to Reddit.\\" Like Reddit, Voat is a collection of entries submitted by its registered users to themed categories (called \\"subverses\\" on Voat) similar to a bulletin board system. Unlike Reddit, Voat has emphasized looser content restrictions and an ad-revenue sharing program. Voat is written in the C# programming language, while Reddit is written in Python. In a January 2017 New Yorker article, Voat was described as a descendant of 2chan, 4chan, and 8chan, where users compete for shock value. The Verge described the site as \\"Imzys dark twin\\", in that both were indirect products of the Gamergate culture war. The name \\"Voat\\" is a play on the words 'goat' and 'vote'. The site's mascot is a goat. The website uses the Colombian top level domain .co which was registered in November 2014.  History  Founded in April 2014 as WhoaVerse, the website was a hobby project of Atif Colo (known on Voat as @Atko), then a student pursuing a BSc, who was later joined by Justin Chastain (known as @PuttItOut). The website has been labelled as an alternative to Reddit with a focus on freedom of expression. In December 2014, WhoaVerse changed its name to Voat for ease of use. In February 2015, following accusations of censorship on Reddit, Voat claimed that they had seen a “large influx” of new users, most of them from Reddit. In early June, 2015, after Reddit banned five of its subreddits for harassment—the largest of which had around 150,000 subscribers—many users of Reddit began to create accounts on Voat. The influx of new participants temporarily overloaded the site, causing downtime. Voat's Germany-based web hosting service, Host Europe (a precursor to Webfusion), shut down the service in June 2015 and alleged Voat \\"was publicizing incitement of the people, as well as abusive, insulting and youth-endangering content\\" as well as \\"illegal right-wing extremist content.\\" Voat's founder attributed the shutdown to political correctness. Voat also had payments frozen by PayPal due to \\"sexually oriented materials or services.\\" Voat shut down four of its own subverses in response, two of which hosted sexualized images of minors (\\"jailbait\\"). The website continued to accept donations in Bitcoin, and was able to continue functioning, as it had moved to a different hosting provider. The website continued to experience downtime due to an ongoing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, rendering the 700,000 unique visitors unable to access the site. In early July 2015, following the dismissal of a popular administrator on Reddit, another influx of Reddit members registered with Voat, leading to traffic which again caused Voat to experience downtime. The developers of the website were subsequently approached by venture capitalists interested in investing in the project. Also in July, Voat, alongside WikiLeaks, was subject to a Bitcoin \\"dust\\" attack and more DDoS attacks. The Bitcoin attack slowed payment processing to the websites. The DDoS attack, launched July 12, was unsuccessful due to Cloudflare services, although it had the side effect of rendering third-party Voat apps incapable of functioning. In August 2015, Voat became incorporated in the United States. Colo explained in a post announcing the incorporation that this was because \\"U.S. law by far beats every other candidate country we’ve researched.\\" In November 2016, more users relocated to Voat after Reddit banned the Pizzagate conspiracy theory subreddit citing doxing and harassment concerns. In January 2017, Colo resigned as CEO of Voat, citing a lack of time available to devote to the site. Colo was replaced as CEO by Chastain. In May 2017, Chastain ran a fundraising campaign, announcing that Voat might have to shut down due to lack of money. In November 2017, some of Reddit's incel community moved to Voat after an incel community was banned on Reddit. On September 12, 2018, Reddit banned several subreddits dedicated to discussing the QAnon conspiracy theory, stating that they had violated its rules prohibiting \\"inciting violence, harassment, and the dissemination of personal information.\\" This caused many of the QAnon posters to migrate to Voat.

It is an allegory on the journey of life, especially at times when one feels victimized or shortchanged, set in the milieu of Indian-English-speaking urban youth. Plot The film looks at the way we casually live in a class system built on blatant economic and social disparities, the way we want to be fooled by our belief systems, the way we validate our tastes and are also very protective of them. By exploring a counter-point for every point, the film subtly questions not only our material value system but also our emotional value system.  Cast  * Varun Thakur - Bharat * Eden Shyodhi - Kesang * Heerok Das - Chandu * Teeshay Shah - Shanti Soundtrack The soundtrack of Yahaan Sabki Lagi Hai consists of 9 tracks composed by Pankaj Awasthi.

Kusumita Das of Deccan Chronicle gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 saying that, \\"The makers of Yahaan Sabki Lagi Hai had an idea, but perhaps didn’t know how best to go about executing it.

It was designed by William R. Miller for Amos F. Gerald, one of Maine's leading businessmen of the late 19th century, and built in 1899-1900. It is a striking Renaissance Revival structure, with a sophistication of design and decoration not normally found in rural Maine, and is one of the town's largest buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Gerald Hotel building is set on the west side of Main Street in the village center of Fairfield, a short way south of the junction of Maine State Route 100 and United States Route 201. The four story brick and terracotta building towers over nearby buildings, which range in height from one to three stories. The main facade is decorated with terracotta trim elements, and is divided into five sections: projecting polygonal corner bays and a central projecting bay flank flat sections. The central bay is supported by iron columns on the first floor, and rises to the fourth. It has rounded corners, with windows at the corners and the center, except for the ground level, where the projection shelters the recessed main entrance. The bay supports rest on a solid slab of granite that was reported to be the largest quarried in Maine at the time. This bay originally had an elaborate rooftop pavilion (visible in the 1905 postcard view); this was removed in the mid-20th century. The flanking flat bays each have paired windows on the upper level (each level having different decorative treatment), and plate glass windows at the ground level. The left corner bay has a carriage entrance at the ground level, with the projecting polygonal bay above. The rightmost bay has a plate glass window at the ground level. The hotel was designed by Lewiston architect William R. Miller and built in 1899-1900 for Amos F. Gerald (1841-1913), one of Maine's leading businessmen. Gerald was born in nearby Benton, and invested in a large number of businesses in Maine, including electric trolley systems in several areas, industrial mills, and amusement parks. He built the state's first electrical power station in Fairfield, and promoted electrification across the state. The elaborate design of the Gerald Hotel was typical of Gerald's buildings, which were intended to be objects of curiosity. Gerald was a longtime Fairfield resident; his house, also a Miller design, is also listed on the National Register. The Gerald Hotel operated for 35 years, with commercial businesses on the ground floor, and was a major gathering point for social and civic events. From an early date, one of the storefronts was occupied by Lawrie Furniture, which occupied the space until 1963 and was the major furniture retailer in the area. The upper floors were converted into apartments in the 1940s. The building underwent rehabilitation in 2015, and now serves as an apartment building for seniors.

In: Gisa Jähnichen (ed.), Studia Instrumentorum Musicae Popularis (New Series) III, Münster: MV-Wissenschaft Verlag, 97-110.Mongolian Music, Dance, & Oral Narrative: Performing Diverse Identities It is similar to the sybyzgy (Kazakh) and kurai (Bashkir). In western Mongolia it is mainly used by the Altai Uriankhai people, although other ethnic groups like the Kazakhs and the Tuvans are known to play them or have played them. There are only three to five holes to finger. The blowing technique utilises the teeth, tongue and lips in the same way as Ney in Classical Persian music. The Tsuur is usually immersed in water before playing in order to seal any leaks in the wood. The melodies that are played on the Tsuur are usually imitations of the sound of water, animal cries and birdsongs as heard by shepherds whilst on the steppes or the mountain slopes of the Altai. One of the melodies, “The flow of the River Eev” as was said before is the river where the sound of khöömii was mythically supposed to have originated. The Uriangkhai called the Tsuur the “Father of Music”. A three-holed pipe was in use in Mongolia in the 18th century and was believed to possess the magical properties of bringing Lamb’s bones back to life. In the Jangar epic of the 14th century the Tsuur is said to have had a voice like a swan. This reference may also be indirectly a very early reference to khöömii as the singing style sung with the Tsuur is Khailakh. Traditional Mongolian Tsuur music was added to the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding in 2009.

The piece was completed in early 1887, shortly after Pierné returned to Paris from a three year stay in Rome.Corleonis, p. 1003 Composition Lasting roughly twenty minutes in performance, the concerto is composed in three movements: #Allegro #Scherzando #Final =Style and influences= The concerto has been compared to the music of fellow French composer Camille Saint-Saëns, specifically his Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor. In the CD liner notes to conductor Juanjo Mena's recording of the Piano Concerto with the BBC Philharmonic, music critic Gerald Larner expanded on the Saint-Saëns comparison, saying: However, the work has also been suggested by Larner and BBC Music Magazine critic Christopher Dingle as inspiration for the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff. Larner commented, \\"It is remarkable more for its anticipation of Rachmaninoff, who comes to mind again in the main 'Allegro deciso,' not in the first theme but when the piano introduces the splendid E-flat-major melody which is to dominate the middle section of the movement and inspire its broad central climax.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo piano and an orchestra consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, tambour, and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Despite noting comparisons to Saint-Saëns, Bryce Morrison of Gramophone said the piece had \\"a scintillating character of its own\\" and specifically praised the second movement, saying, \\"Only a puritan could resist the second-movement 'Scherzando,' where a jaunty theme is sent spinning through a maze of sparkling Christmas-tree elaboration.\\" In the All Music Guide to Classical Music, Adrian Corleonis likened the work to Pierné's own Fantaisie-ballet for Piano and Orchestra (1885), commenting, \\"If not great music, it is well made, often spurred by robust gaiety, and of engaging freshness.\\" Corleonis added, \\"...[they] are imposing examples, their mock seriousness yielding to caressing lyricism.\\" Conversely, Andrew Clements of The Guardian called the work \\"a curiously bombastic mix of Saint-Saëns and Tchaikovsky\\" and added \\"I find its winsomeness hard to take, though others might be more tolerant.\\" References Bibliography * Category:Compositions by Gabriel Pierné Category:1887 compositions Pierné Category:Compositions in C minor ","title":"Piano Concerto (Pierné)"},{"id":"45505241","text":"The Hop Aphid, or Damson-hop aphid, (Phorodon humuli), is an aphid in the superfamily Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera.

It is the only existing casa hacienda administered by friars in the Philippines that remains to be used at present.  History  The hacienda was originally constructed around 1830 by the Dominican priests after purchasing a large tract of real estate property known as the Hacienda de San Isidro Labrador to serve as housing for the overseers and workers of the said hacienda. During the Philippine Revolution, Casa Hacienda fell into the hands of Filipino revolutionaries. It was here that the Naic Assembly was held on April 17, 1897, presided over by Emilio Aguinaldo who had been elected President in the Tejeros Convention on March 27. The Assembly elected a number of cabinet officials, including Pascual Alvarez as the Secretary of the Interior after its first elected secretary, Andres Bonifacio, did not assume the post in protest of the Tejeros Convention results; Baldomero Aguinaldo as Secretary of Finance; Jacinto Lumbreras as Secretary of State; Severino de las Alas as Secretary of Justice; and Mariano Alvarez as Secretary of Development. The hacienda later served as base of operations for Bonifacio and his men who, on April 19, 1897, proclaimed the Naic Military Agreement. That agreement created a rival government headed by Bonifacio, effectively rejecting the Aguinaldo-led government. This led to the eventual arrest of Bonifacio, who was held together with his brother Procopio in a cell located in Casa Hacienda before he was taken to Maragondon where he would be tried and later executed. Casa Hacienda eventually became part of the Naic Elementary School.

It was the first royal project designed by the chief imperial architect Mimar Sinan. History The mosque complex was commissioned by Haseki Hürrem Sultan, the wife of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She had married the sultan around 1534 and probably used her dowry to finance the project. The buildings were designed by the architect Mimar Sinan. It was his first imperial project and it is possible that some elements were planned by his predecessor. The complex contained a Friday mosque, a soup-kitchen (imaret), a madrasa, an elementary school (mektep) and a hospital (darüssifa). The large complex was built in several stages on either side of a narrow street. The mosque was completed in 1538–39 (AH 945), the madrasa was completed a year later in 1539–40 (AH 946) and the soup- kitchen in 1540–41 (AH 947). The hospital was not completed until 1550–51 (AH 957). Description The simple mosque is constructed with alternating courses of stone and brick and has a single-galleried minaret. The portico has five arches with five small domes supported by six thin marble columns. Originally the prayer-hall was covered by a single dome with a diameter of 11.3 meters. In 1612–13, during the reign of Ahmed I, the mosque was enlarged to accommodate an increased congregation. A second dome was added and the prayer hall was doubled in size. The painted decorations on the dome are not original. Unlike the madrasa and the soup-kitchen, the mosque lacks any cuerda seca tile-work. The hospital has an octagonal courtyard and is the only building in the complex with an ashlar construction. The carved stone inscription over the entrance from the street is a chronogram in Turkish giving the date of construction. The madrasa is U-shaped around a central courtyard with 16 small cells and a lecture hall. The soup-kitchen is also arranged around a courtyard. The cooking area at the northern end has four octagonal chimneys. A surviving account book shows that there were originally tiled lunette panels above six of the windows. The complex was restored in 2010–2012.

It is the principal vector of many viruses in economically important field crops. Host plants and distribution R. padi has a worldwide distribution and according to research, they can colonize a number of dicotyledon host plants, although their preference is within monocotyledon plant groups much like the closely related R. maidis and R. rufiabdominale. The main plant hosts are categorized and listed below but as the name suggests, the primary host is Prunus padus, where it overwinters as eggs. In Northern America, it is found to overwinter on Prunus virginiana (common choke-cherry). In spring, it attacks all major cereals and pasture grasses; particularly barley, oats, wheat and other Gramineae plant species. It is also commonly found in maize growing regions.  Virus vector  Bird cherry-oat aphid can vector a number of serious diseases including the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), the cereal yellow dwarf virus–RPV, filaree red leaf virus, maize leaf fleck virus, and rice giallume virus. It is also known to cause oat yellow leaf disease and the onion yellow dwarf virus.  Natural enemies  A number of aphidophagous arthropods feed on R. padi and can reduce their population density. Because of R. padi's distribution at the basis of cereal stems, generalist predators such as carabids and spiders can reduce their population density. In addition, more specialist predators include adults and larvae of Coccinellids, hoverfly larvae and lacewing larvae, as well as adult parasitoid wasps in the subfamily Aphidiinae.

It's used to describe a person of good character. The omoluabi concept signifies courage, hard work, humility and respect.Fola Kareem Olajoku - \\"Nigeria: The Omoluwabi Terminology\\" An omoluabi is a person of honor who believes in hard work, respects the rights of others, and gives to the community in deeds and in action. Above all, an omoluwabi is a person of integrity.Dolapo Adeniji-Neill, PH.D. Adelphi University Ruth S. Ammon School of Education Garden City, NY - \\"Omoluwabi: The Way Of Human Being: An African Philosophy's Impact On Nigerian Voluntary Immigrants Educational And Other Life Aspirations\\" The Omoluwabi concept is an adjectival Yoruba phrase, which has the words - \\"Omo + ti + Olu-iwa + bi\\" as its components. Literally translated and taken separately, omo means 'child', ti means 'that or which', Olu-iwa is a name of God in Yoruba, meaning the chief or master of Iwa (character), bi means 'born'. When combined, Omoluabi translates as \\"the child begotten by the chief of iwa (or \\"child begotton by God\\"). Such a child is thought of as a paragon of excellence in character.Fayemi, Ademola Kazeem, Department of Philosophy, Lagos State University Ojo, Lagos - \\"Human Personality and the Yoruba Worldview: An Ethico-Sociological Interpretation\\" An omoluwabi demonstrates and exhibits the inherent virtue and value of Iwapele. Iwapele is ultimately the basis of moral conduct in Yoruba culture and a core defining attribute of an omoluwabi. The most fundamental of these principles demonstrated by an omoluabi are;Abimbola, Wande (1975) “Iwapele: The Concept of Good Character in Ifa Literary Corpus”, Wande Abimbola (ed.) Yoruba Oral Tradition: Poetry in Music Dance and Drama (Ibadan: University of Ibadan Press). * Oro Siso (Spoken word, the Yoruba accord great respect for intelligent and expert use of language) * Iteriba (Respect) * Inu Rere (Good will, Having a good mind towards others) * Otito (Truth) * Iwa (Character) * Akinkanju (Bravery) * Ise (Hardwork) * Opolo Pipe (Intelligence) An individual can be termed an omoluabi irrespective of the religion the person adheres to. Consequently, some of the characteristics and traits of an omoluabi are considered virtues in many religions, for example, humility, truth and honesty. Omoluwabi is a variant of Omoluabi broken down into Omo-l-ua-bi. As defined previously, Omo is child. The letter \\"l\\" is a link similar to \\"ti\\" meaning that or which. The word \\"ua\\" means community meeting place, normally at the palace when the Oba presides. The word \\"bi\\" means \\"born\\".

As a member of the superfamily Aphidoidea, it is one of 16 species of the genus Rhopalosiphum. Adults and nymphs are soft-bodied and usually dark green with brown, red, or yellow tones. Like all aphids, reproduction is sexual and asexual, depending on the environmental conditions and host plant. Rice root aphids cause injury to external plant parts, namely the roots or stem, by feeding on plant sap and vector several important plant viruses. The hosts of this pest extend across multiple plant families with most belonging to Rosaceae, Poaceae, and Solanaceae. R. rufiabdominale is universally associated with Prunus species but also infests various field crops, greenhouse vegetables, cannabis, and other ornamental plants. While this aphid originates from east Asia, it spans nearly every continent. Dispersal is particularly widespread across the United States, India, and Australia, with crop damage documented in multiple instances, although economic losses are primarily associated with Japanese rice crops. Nonetheless, it remains a pest of serious concern due to its high mobility, discrete habitat, and adaptive plasticity, giving it the rightful reputation as a successful invader. Description = Identification = Rice root aphids at the base of a rice plant Initial detection can be difficult as root aphids preferred surroundings are in the soil or media. However, it can also infest the roots of crops grown in both hydroponic and aeroponic systems. Connecting the pest with plant symptoms is often delayed or unknown unless roots are carefully inspected, or winged adults are present above ground. In hydroponic systems, irrigation events may bring aphids to surface level for short periods making them more visible. Plant irregularities such as chlorosis and stunting can be mistaken as a nutritional imbalance and wilting as a disease. As population densities increase, winged adults can emerge from fissures in the soil upwards to the crop canopy to populate elsewhere. If sticky traps are employed, it may be the first indication of their presence. Ants have a mutualistic relationship with aphids and are attracted to the honeydew they produce; their presence is a strong indication that aphids are populating. alt= = Morphology = Adults are 1.4-2.4 mm long with a soft rounded body; they are distinguished from Rhopalosiphum padi by their five antennal segments and more dense setae. Wingless forms range in coloration; the body can be dark green to brown with yellow or red tinges. Winged forms tend to display a darker coloration, and both life stages have a lateral bluish-white wax that bands across the dorsal region. The femora, cornicles, and cauda are darker than the other body parts. Body hairs, known as setae, are generally short and dense while the hairs on the five segmented antennae are longer. The antennal tubercles are reduced or nearly absent compared to other species. The cauda, a tail-like extension, is shorter than the cornicles syn. siphuncles, which are also rather short and slightly swollen towards the tips. = Biology = Unique to root aphids, most of their life cycle occurs below ground, with winged adults only emerging from soil to colonize new host plants. In their native range, rice root aphids have a heteroecious holocyclic life cycle. They alternate between the aerial plant parts of Prunus species through the fall and winter while colonizing other herbaceous hosts' roots for the remainder of the year. In more temperate regions or protected cultivation, reproduction is frequently performed asexually, usually on secondary hosts. With this method, parthenogenesis, no fertilization is required for egg development; females give birth to genetically identical daughter offspring. These newly emerged nymphs mature in less than ten days. As adults, they live up to thirty days reproducing daily. Under ideal conditions, temperatures of 23 degrees Celsius, a new generation occurs every seven days, and populations are known to double in less than two days. Mitotically derived eggs are also produced if necessary, to overwinter until environmental conditions improve. While they prefer below surface locations, winged adults can persist for weeks on aerial plant parts. Rice root aphids have a rasping-sucking mouthpart that facilitates the efficient removal of plant phloem. Both nymphs and adults feed on all development stages seedling, vegetative, or flowering, but survival can be limited to a few days without a host plant present.  Ecology  = Distribution = Rice root aphid is a Palearctic species that are distributed worldwide, in every terrestrial habitat, except for Antarctica. From Japan, it has migrated throughout Asia and Oceania and is now established in over fifty countries as an occasional or severe pest of many important growing regions. It has been present in North America for over a hundred years and can be found throughout Canada and the United States. Within American borders, the pest is particularly advanced and has been identified in nearly half of the fifty-two states. The spread has extended to other areas, including seven African and South American countries and three European countries. Each of these nations has had difficulty with this pest, especially those with expansive agricultural or horticultural regions. = Plant hosts = R. rufiabdominale is a highly polyphagous species with a broad host range distributed across twenty-two plant families. The majority of hosts are found in the following plant families: Rosaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Solanaceae, Cannabaceae, Pinaceae, or Cucurbitaceae. In Europe, it was reported that rice root aphid will also colonize host plants belonging to Araceae, Asteraceae and Ranunculaceae. Research has shown that they can infest a large number of dicotyledonous plants, although their affinity lies predominantly within monocotyledon taxonomic groups. This preference is similar to the closely related R. maidis and R. padi and is especially true for plants that belong to the family Poaceae. The main plant hosts are categorized and listed below. * Agriculture crops including cereals, grains, and grasses: rice, barley, wheat, oats, millet, sorghum, cotton, sugarcane, and tobacco * Vegetable crops: aubergine, tomato, pepper, potato, corn, cauliflower, celery, and squash * Ornamental plants and fruit trees: Prunus spp. (17 known stone fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs), grasses, Dieffenbachia spp., and irises * Other: cannabis sativa, sedge, and forestry trees *Primary hosts are denoted in bold  Impact  While rice root aphid damage had been reasonably chronicled, the economic effects are far less documented. It may be due in part to the aphids subterranean habitat or unknown influence on overall plant fitness. In terms of economic importance, crops such as rice, barley, wheat, potato, tomato, plum, and apricot top the list. R. rufiabdominale is considered one of the most abundant aphids affecting wheat and grain crops in the United States. In both Europe and Canada, root aphid has been cataloged as a persistent or occasional pest in hydroponically grown plants with the first infestation in Ontario greenhouse tomatoes and peppers occurring in 2005. This presents implications for those commodities and cereal crops in the region that are highly susceptible to barley yellow dwarf virus, an economically important barley disease. In 2005, the first holocyclic colony outside of eastern Asia was reported in Italy. The aphid completed its life cycle on Prunus domestica, the common plum, and Prunus armeniaca, apricot, leading to concerns for Poaceae and stone fruit crops in the temperate region. More recently, rice root aphid has been frequently reported as a severe pest of indoor-grown cannabis in Canada and the United States. With no pause between crop cycles, limited research, or treatments available, it has become highly problematic to manage. The recent legalization of cannabis in eleven states in the United States and nationally in Canada has increased the dialogue and studies. Still, approval at a federal level is needed to elevate the research and funding to develop management strategies across stakeholders. = Damage = Adults and nymphs externally feed on the roots and occasionally the stem, passively consuming the phloem, causing vigor loss. The feeding sites' location can become discolored and leaves or stems, chlorotic or pale. Plant parts may also appear desiccated and distorted or display the formation of rosettes. High pest densities can cause wilting of the whole plant and result in death. In rice, it is well documented that injury causes leaf chlorosis and stunted growth with severe infestations exhibiting wilt followed by plant death. Aphids also produce honeydew; the deposits can promote mold or fungal growth known as sooty mold. Below the surface, this may resemble a light dusty halo, not dissimilar to powdery mildew spots. Even outside of typical host range, serious indirect consequences among plants can occur due to their stylet's investigative probe that transfers saliva resulting in serious plant disease transmission. This indirect injury can vector sugar cane yellow leaf virus and barley yellow dwarf virus. In India, it has been reported to transmit maize mosaic virus and sugarcane mosaic virus. = Losses = The most widely referenced literature is associated with upland rice crops in Japan. It is reported that yield declines of up to 50% due to light feeding on seedlings, followed by severe damage at tiller formation. In the summer of 1990, the aphid appeared as a major pest of a squash crop in Florida, causing the roots to darken and rot. However, there was no mention of economic loss. The pest was more recently identified, for the first time, as severely damaging an organic celery crop in California. While Hyadaphis foeniculi, honeysuckle aphid, was also detected and uncommon pest for celery, the combined infestation resulted in yield losses of up to 80% due to severe stunting. Periodic losses due to barley yellow dwarf virus have been described in North America and Europe, including Turkey, where barley cropping is commonplace. Management alt= An integrated pest management system is the best approach to regulating rice root aphid. It is a relatively complicated pest to manage because it primarily resides below the soil line, limiting biological control options and rendering foliar insecticides ineffective. It makes early detection through systematic crop monitoring and visual observation essential. Additionally, preventative measures through cultural and physical controls in conjunction with carefully selected biological control organisms and judicious use of biopesticides offer the best defense. = Physical and cultural control = In late spring, winged adults are known to migrate to new hosts both in the field and greenhouses. Physical exclusion with netting or screens can prevent the colonization of the roots. For overwintering eggs that persist in soil or media, heat sterilization could be employed. However, this treatment has been shown to reduce microorganism diversity. Procuring certified substrates can reduce the risk of introduction in specialized media. It may also be important to use coarse or chipped media instead of fine-textured particles. Root aphids are known to appear in greater abundance when reared in sandy soil. Disruption of requisites through crop rotation or fallowing to establish a host-free period can be useful as this species may display an affinity to particular cultivars. Reducing favorable conditions or locations that harbor root aphids can also suppress establishment. Removing other plant and weed hosts, especially herbaceous monocots, is another simple tactic to implement. Moving away from using mulched top dressing, preferred by this pest, may also reduce the chance of infestation. = Biological and biopesticide control = For winged adults, several natural enemies used for other aphid species may prove useful. These include Coccinellids, known as the ladybird beetles, Aphidoletes aphidimyza, or other syrphid fly larvae and Chrysoperla species, the green or brown lacewings. Several species of Aphelinus, a parasitic wasp, will also feed on winged adults but should not be relied upon for sufficient control. The only potential soil-dwelling biological control agent is Stratiolaelaps scimitus syn. Hypoaspis miles. It is a generalist predator commonly enlisted to target fungus gnat larvae. Still, it may offer some below ground suppression of rice root aphid. In the early 1990s Lecanicillium lecanii, formerly Verticillium lecanii, was discovered by chance after a marked decline of rice root aphid levels among infested squash plants without deliberate intervention. Their death was a result of infection by the entomopathogenic fungus, which consumes the aphid internally. After subsequent inoculations on other crops, the assertion was made that suppression could be achieved, leading to its routine use on the pest. A 2014 study in organic cropping systems suggests that non-chemical control using microbials and botanicals can reduce sub-soil pest populations in organic vegetable crops. Soil treatments of Beauveria bassiana, in conjunction with azadirachtin, neem oil reduced aphid populations by 62% after two applications. Further, Chromobacterium subtsugae and Burkholderia spp. showed a reduction of 29% and 24%, respectively. Differences in efficacy between modes of action and treatment combinations indicate that additional research would enhance pest management decision making. Another application for these types of products includes using them as a cutting dip. Imported plant material can be treated with insecticidal soap or Beauveria bassiana before introduced to production facilities. = Chemical control = In the past, systemic insecticides have been used to control this pest. The availability and application frequency of these types of products has declined with more recent concerns surrounding pest resistance, persistence in soils and water, accumulation in the food chain, and reductions of natural enemy populations. Many of these pesticide formulations are now prohibited for use; this includes endosulfan, one of the few insecticides known to be effective against rice root aphids. Carbofuran, a chemical soil treatment, once touted as a useful tool, is now proven to be highly toxic with environmental and ecological implications that negatively affect multitrophic level interactions. With scant chemical products and further reassessments and de- registrations expected as research evolves, this control method remains an unviable option for rice root aphid.

He is the founder and director of Project Concern International (PCI) and an activist against the impact of war and poverty on young people in Asia. Turpin was raised in eastern Kentucky in Ashland. In 1960 he began a lifelong activism for those suffering from lack of medical care and impoverished living conditions notably in Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Appalachia, through Project Concern International and gained respect from those he helped and recognition from service oriented institutions for it. Conflict over medical advice his family was personally given gave rise to a new field of tort law called wrongful life. He currently lives in western North Carolina and continues his activism. Earliest years James Wesley Turpin, was born about 1928 and was raised in eastern Kentucky in Ashland. His parents were Evelyn Hope Duke and James William 'Bill' Turpin. James William was a safety engineer in the company that became Armco Steel Corp. His mother's father was John Wesley Duke,* * a doctor, and much of a model for young Turpin. Jim has a brother, William. Early adulthood In high school Turpin had been granted a \\"local license\\" to preach at five area churches. In World War II Turpin served in the Navy as a medic. He got into college on a veteran's assistance program at Emory University. He initially sought to go to medical school but after failing an organic chemistry class he was advised away from medicine and instead studying theology with the Candler School. However one year into the theology school he successfully took a chemistry class, so he added going to the medical school as a fulfillment of his childhood aims modeled on his grandfather. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1949. In 1949 he also married Martha (often Mollie or Molly) Williamson of Georgia who had graduated the same year. They had four children; their first child was born about 1951, the same year he finished his theology degree. He was ordained as a Methodist minister in 1954 and finished his medical degree in 1955. The family moved to Coronado, California in 1957 after a short period of service in Georgia. In Coronado he bought a successful medical practice with a salary reportedly of over $50k/year, from a retiring physician. Turpin was elected to the city council in San Diego, served as a Sunday School teacher at the Methodist Church and was elected the vice president of the local Parent-Teacher Association. Still, as he said in his biographical article, and first book, he was not satisfied that he had a meaningful life and was restless and elsewhere said: \\"A vague but disturbing disenchantment set in.\\" Project Concern  Through an adult class at a Methodist church he learned of the Casa de Todos clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, in about 1960. He reflected on the experience in a 1967 article. There he was able to save the lives of two children during a period he volunteered one day a week. But he found he needed to do something more substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos. =Going international= Turpin had tried to join various services that could be vehicles for his work, but either got no replies or they wanted other things than what he could provide. He was attracted to the work of Dr. Tom Dooley who had previously worked in medical relief in Vietnam. He got the idea of going to Hong Kong because of some TV coverage related through a patient's mother at Casa de Todos. He left for Hong Kong in September 1961 on an exploratory trip to feel out the need, logistics and possibilities.* * From this exploration his attention was focused on two areas - the people living on boats and the Kowloon Walled City. He ran into legal and cultural protocols he had failed to appreciate, and needed to register with the \\"British Medical Council\\" to run a clinic. They gained a match because they were a nurses group who needed a doctor and had patients and he was a doctor that needed patients. He gained more assistants willing to do the work in 1962* * and he embarked on a fund-raising tour.* * He also expanded the initial land based clinic with a boat-clinic named \\"Yauh Oi\\", Chinese for \\"Brotherly Love\\". Martha was a lab tech. There was an immediate satisfaction from being close to suffering and being able to make a difference. News of the work had spread and in late December Turpin was on a Jaycee (United States Junior Chamber) list of Ten Outstanding Young Americans for his project. * * By 1963 he was raising funds from Australia and US.  His family moved to Hong Kong and he closed the practice in the States. Through the year Project Concern continued to grow with assistants. One of the volunteer doctors working in Hong Kong related that he had seen similar intense suffering and privation in Vietnam on the way north. In 1964 Project Concern expanded into Vietnam, during the Vietnam War, * including training local volunteers in a network across nearby villages \\\\- a program that was expanded by 1967, earning local trust. Assisting in the development of self-help became a clear goal of the organization. =An enterprise= Project Concern was then widely promoted as independent of government or religion, relying solely on private contributions and not formally presenting religion in the process (though still promoted in some instances religiously), with individuals of some 20 nationalities among 100 staff by 1965. Contributions and money arrived from further afield in 1965, including the support of then Miss America for 1966. Some work of the project included school classes with students from Stanford working for a time. In 1965-66 his wife and children returned to the States and Martha began going to medical school. In 1963, perhaps reflecting his own restlessness in earlier years and why he worked in the project, Turpin said: \\"A rut is like a grave with the ends knocked out. I think probably a lot of people are living in a rut and don't know why and I've got a possible solution for them in Project Concern.\\" In 1966 Turpin was using words of the 17th century poet John Donne in publicity of Project Concern such as \\"No man is an island entire of itself… any man's death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never seem to know for who the bell tolls - it tolls for thee.\\" There were four clinics in Vietnam plus Hong Kong and Tijuana. In 1966 his book Vietnam Doctor: the story of Project Concern was published, was reviewed over the years and donated to libraries.* * Meanwhile, Turpin embarked on a fund-raising tour for Project Concern, noting it was $20,000 a month to run the set of clinics circa 1966, and newspapers also mentioned his wife's progress in medical school in 1967. * * She was nearly finished by 1969. Turpin had an article published in the Guideposts magazine which was then often echoed in many newspapers under various titles: * \\"The only way to belong to life\\"  \\"God has never failed us\\", * \\"A dream becomes a reality\\" * \\"Their victory for us all in Vietnam\\" * \\"I had failed to take the first little step\\"* * He used another quote to express the nature of the work of Project Concern - as Turpin heard volunteer Maria Meza say it: \\"Love you? I am you.\\" Turpin's time was split between fund-raising tours and work in the field across 1968 to 1970.     He got two more assistants who were enthusiastic for the work. One of the innovations in fund- raising was named \\"Walk for Mankind\\" in 1969 which kept up in 1970 and 1971. The Walk was reflected on as originating with the Project in later years though it had since been used for other fund-raising goals (and has been used in other particulars - see Gerry Bertier and He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother). Another innovation in fund-raising was a film Involved in mankind. The National Institutes of Health program of clinics was referenced needing the enthusiasm Turpin presented and inspired. Turpin was still visibly noted as a Methodist minister. Project Concern opened an Appalachia unit in Byrdstown, Tennessee in 1969 - a town with no doctor for 9 years and no dentist in 63 was served with a number of volunteers for a while. Farmington, New Mexico was added as another site. Project Concern began to have regional offices.* * In 1970 Turpin published his second book - A Faraway Country: The Continuing Story of Project Concern. He undertook a 1970 tour for funding, * while adding a project site in Bisti, New Mexico, (near the Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness.) Project Concern was forced to leave Vietnam in 1972 during the later days of the war. Instead Turpin and Molly attended the national Project Concern meeting in March and they were profiled in a Good Housekeeping article. Turpin and Mollie did work together in Tennessee for Project Concern in 1973. Activism With the escalating concerns about war in Vietnam he spoke publicly about his views of the apparent priorities of winning the war but losing the people: * \\"People who live under pathological conditions are going to choose pathological solutions to solve their problems\\" In 1967 he became more vocal: * \\"It costs $224,000 to kill one Viet Cong (and half of that)… can educate thousands\\" * \\"If we had done in 1945 in Asia what we did in Europe with the Marshall Plan, the crisis in Asia would not have developed.\\" * \\"I'm not a militarist or even a strategist. All I know is the TB, hookworm, and malnutrition which sap the people of Vietnam.\\" Turpin promoted the idea of shifting the orientation in the war to what he called at the time \\"nation builders\\" of skilled staff to help transform society - his list was \\"doctors, dentists, nurses, laboratory techs, sanitationists, teachers, agricultural technicians, civil engineers, animal husbandry technicians, and cottage industry technicians.\\" Other quotes at the time showing his thinking include: * \\"It takes $260,000 to kill one VC and one cent a meal to feed a Vietnam child.\\" * \\"I am confident we need these people as much as they need us.\\" * \\"We have an increasing number of people who don't have any feelings about anything - they're called 'silent sinners'.\\" * \\"The bird who bothers me most is not the hawk or the dove, but the ostrich - so many people have their heads in the sand.\\" He sent a plan for peace to Vietnamese and US governments centered around social development. He became hopeful while still seeking to energize youth - \\"Our troublers of today have been there for years, but we are more concerned now. We are coming to grips with our problems like we never have before. We have never had such idealistic times.\\" He focused the attention of people who read and heard him speak that the problem was poverty instead of politics. Turpin advocated for ways for youth to participate in the troubles in society and gained a wristband of brotherhood with the Montagnard or Degar people of Vietnam in 1971. Doctors continued to join in the work - one for Appalachia in 1971. Meanwhile, Molly finished her internship. They considered working at the new Arizona project. Turpin spoke at the Winter 1972 Jaycee conference concerned with furthering brotherhood through the world and reflected on how he got started but that the situation in American was suffering too: * \\"make the Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence come alive.\\" * \\"a revolution in the attitudes toward building a brave, new world.\\" * \\"I've had a bellyful of the Great White Father.\\" New life Turpin ended being general director of Project Concern in 1974, lost his elder son in a plane crash, was divorced, and joined the Baháʼí Faith. He continued the work in Appalachia relief and his conversion lead him to meet Donna Wrenn Turner, who had been a member of the religion since 1964 and they were soon married, (in a Baháʼí ceremony.)Turner-Turpin, Asheville Citizen-Times (Asheville, North Carolina)15 Sep 1974, p. 40 Turpin appeared in a very few fund-raisers for Project Concern in 1975* * \\\\- the same year Turpin and Wrenn (as she is known) had their first child. = Wrongful life case= By the later 1970s it was clear his two new daughters were deaf. Soon a case was filed pointing to wrongful genetic counseling - it was found he and Wrenn shared recessive genes such that there was a high chance of deaf children. The case escalated and became known as the Wrongful life case.* * Initially the family had moved to Guam about 1976–1977 to pioneer to support the Baháʼís and promote the religion while running a clinic on the island. However, when their eldest child's hearing problem was substantiated they moved back to California. In the midst of the case in May 1981 they moved to North Carolina and the case was finally settled in 1982. =Semi-retirement in North Carolina= In North Carolina Turpin was visible working for the Baháʼí Faith when he gave a couple of talks in 1982 about the religion and human action in Raleigh at North Carolina State University for the Baháʼí club in February.* * In March an interview of Turpin was published highlighting the Persecution of Baháʼís in Iran since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In March 1986 he re-visited the Tijuana clinic and commented \\"My friends say I was always a Bahai.\\" In May Turpin participated in a Peace Conference hosted by Baháʼís in Hawaii in honor of the International Year of Peace.* * Following improved relations with Vietnam he learned one of the hospitals he had built - and one of the trainees he had trained - was still operating in Vietnam. After making contact he was invited to visit and took the opportunity to promote peace. It was one of the hospitals originally funded by the American Legion. Back in the States Turpin gave a talk on Vietnam for the Baháʼí club at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the fall of 1989 * * In 1993, doing part-time work in occupational medicine in western NC, he was able to re-engage with a second of the hospitals in Vietnam he had founded through Project Concern. Then he worked full-time with the North Carolina Department of Corrections with inmates across several counties of western NC, volunteered at a local clinic, and decided to bring an orchestra performance near the clinic. In 2002 Turpin and Wrenn attended a fundraiser of Project Concern International. Awards In 1962 Turpin was on the Jaycee list of Ten outstanding young men. This was the start of a more than decade long relationship with the Jaycee's and funding for Turpin's work. In 1963 the Freedom Leadership Medal was awarded to Turpin by Freedoms Foundation. In 1993 he was awarded the International Humanity Award from the American Red Cross Overseas Association. In 2011 he was awarded an Emory Medal, the highest honor for alumni of Emory University, Georgia.

In operation since 1828, during the earliest days of the University, the cemetery is the final resting place for many University of Virginia professors, administrators, and alumni. It includes a large burial area that holds the remains of 1,097 Confederate States Army soldiers. The cemetery is in two sections; the newer section includes a columbarium to provide more space for burials. History The first burial in what was to become the University of Virginia Cemetery was Henry William Tucker, younger brother of University professor George Tucker and the first victim of a typhoid fever outbreak at the University in 1828. Other typhoid victims followed. The cemetery also received victims of accidental death. During the American Civil War, the cemetery received the bodies of many Confederate soldiers who died in the University hospital. Temporary wood markers were raised by the Ladies Confederate Memorial Association. The markers were replaced with more permanent ones, including a large stone statue of a Confederate soldier designed by sculptor Caspar Buberl, in 1893. The final burial plots in the cemetery were sold in 1966. In 1987, the University of Virginia Board of Visitors approved the construction of a columbarium to receive cremated remains. The wall was completed in 1991, originally holding 180 vaults and now holding 360. In November 2012, the University discovered a previously undocumented \\"black burial ground\\" outside the walls of the cemetery. It is believed that the burial ground may hold remains of emancipated workers, slaves, or both. In all, the burial ground was discovered to contain 67 graves.

It is estimated to have been built c. 1810 by Ichabod Higgins, and is one of the oldest structures in the area, dating to the first settlement period of Indian Point. The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Higgins Barn is set on the west side of Oak Hill Road, about from the roadway. The property also includes a c. 1830-40s Cape house, which has been extensively altered, a family cemetery, and several other outbuildings. The barn, 1-1/2 stories in height, measures , and is oriented with its front (located on a long side, as is typical for English barns) facing east. Constructed of hand-hewn timbers, it is set on a fieldstone foundation, and has a side-gable roof. The walls are sheathed in a variety of wood shingles, some of which are typical clipped and rounded shingles of the Late Victorian period. The main facade has an off-center double sliding door sheltered by a wide portico, with a window at the first floor level to one side and a second at loft height on the other. The upper southernmost part of the barn slightly overhangs an open area used for wood storage and a chicken yard; this is a later 19th-century alteration. The main access door on the west side, originally matching that on the east side, has been closed off and the space partly taken up by two windows. The interior has a typical English barn layout, with a central wide hall, with animal stalls to either side, with hay lofts above. The stalls on the left have been partly disassembled due to the installation of milking equipment. Indian Point is located on the northwestern part of Mount Desert Island. Members of the Higgins family were among the first to settle the island in 1763, and Ichabod Higgins' parents moved to the island from Cape Cod in 1778. A deed transferring of land at Indian Point from John Barnard, one of the island's early owners, to Ichabod Higgins was recorded in May 1811. Higgins had by then died, but his estate was recorded to include a house and barn, indicating he had probably been on the land for some time. The land in this area remained in the hands of Higgins descendants and in agricultural use for many years, and the parcel including the house and barn was in size in 1981, when it was subdivided for development.

Erected in 1610 it is the last of the monumental calvaries of Brittany. See also Saint-Thégonnec Parish close. Background and description of the calvary Apart from Roland Doré's \\"Christ aux outrages\\", and the crucifixion cross attributed to Yann Larhantec, the sculptural work on this calvary has been attributed to the Maître de Saint-Thégonnec's workshop, who are also credited with work on the calvary of the St Sébastien Chapel at Saint-Ségal and another at Locquénolé near Morlaix. In 1794, during the course of the French revolution, the calvary was knocked down but the local people managed to save the sculptures and hide them away, although some were lost. The calvary was the subject of a major restoration in 1970 by the organization Mainponte de Paris. The scenes depicted on the calvary relate to Jesus Christ's passion, his death and his resurrection and, in addition, there is a statue of St Thégonnec himself complete with the depiction of a wolf. The south face The sculptures on this face depict Jesus Christ's arrest and the Mocking of Jesus (\\"Christ aux outrages\\"). The two people shown in the arrest sequence who carry phylacteries are almost certainly the priests sent to arrest Jesus. They carry law scrolls and are accompanied by a guard who has a sword tucked into his belt. The three crosses The pietà on the crucifixion cross. The Virgin Mary puts her right hand on her chest and holds her dead son's hand. Note the stigmata in Jesus' right hand. On the far left of the crosspiece is a statue of Mary Magdalene holding her pot of ointment. In the pietà, there are depictions of Mary Magdalene and John the Evangelist on each side of Mary. They both touch Jesus' body On the calvary platform are three crosses. We see Jesus on the central cross with four angels collecting his blood and on the reverse an \\"Ecce Homo\\". Jesus has a horsed cavalier on either side of him and on the lower crosspiece there is a depiction of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, with St Peter on one side and John the Evangelist on the other, whilst on the reverse of these three figures there is a pietà in the centre with the Virgin Mary on one side and St Yves on the other. There are two smaller crosses, one on each side of the crucifixion cross, from which the two robbers hang. The good robber turns to Jesus whilst the bad robber turns away from him. At the foot of the main cross there is a statue of Mary Magdalene looking up towards Jesus and on the pedestal platform a \\"mise au tombeau\\" and a depiction of Jesus' resurrection. The east face The calvary at Saint-Thégonnec. In this view of the calvary we start on the left side with Jesus being flogged by two men and then a priest holding a banner bearing the inscription \\"Ecce Homo\\". Jesus stands behind him wearing a robe and the crown of thorns. He is held by a soldier. We then see a Pontius Pilate in the act of washing his hands whilst a servant holds out a bowl of water and a towel. He watches Jesus being led away by two soldiers. We finish with some women at the tail end of the procession depicting Jesus carrying the cross to Golgotha On the east face and from left to right we have sculptures dealing with the Flagellation of Christ, an \\"Ecce Homo\\", Pontius Pilate washing his hands, Jesus held by soldiers, the scene depicting the cortege accompanying Christ carrying the cross, Jesus' meeting with Mary Magdalene (Resurrection appearances of Jesus), St Veronica with her veil and Mary Magdalene with a pot of ointment. * In the flagellation scene, Jesus is tied to a pillar whilst being whipped by two soldiers. One has his back to Jesus and the other seems to be enjoying what he is doing, his tongue stuck out. * In the next scene a pharisee, law scrolls in his hand, points to a banner across his chest which reads \\"Ecce Homo\\". Jesus turns towards him, his hands tied with rope. He wears the so-called \\"royal robe\\" and the crown of thorns. The soldier accompanying him appears to be pushing him forward. * Then we see Pontius Pilate washing his hands after he has effectively condemned Jesus to death. Then we see Jesus being led away by two soldiers to be crucified. * In the scene depicting the cortege accompanying Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary/Golgotha we see three women following at the end of the procession, the first of whom has her hands clasped in prayer. The actual depiction of Jesus carrying the cross appears around the corner on the next face. The north face On this face we have a depiction of Jesus carrying the cross, Simon of Cyrene helping him. Jesus is surrounded by four executioners. The actions of these soldiers are clearly intended to make Jesus' task of carrying the cross more difficult. The west face In the \\"mise au tombeau\\", (literally the \\"laying in the tomb\\") scene, Jesus' body is being prepared for burial. At Jesus' , Nicodemus holds the now discarded Crown of thorns and at Jesus' feet Joseph of Arimathea is depicted holding a shroud. We see Mary Magdalene holding her pot of ointment and the Virgin Mary being comforted by St John. Behind this group and at the foot of the cross we see Mary Magdalene looking up at Jesus. Around the body we see the Virgin Mary being comforted by John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene holding a pot of ointment. Just behind this group we can see Mary Magdalene kneeling at the base of the cross as she looks up at the crucified Jesus On this face we have the entombment and the resurrection. * In the \\"mise au tombeau\\" scene there are eight people around the body of Jesus. St John holds the Virgin Mary's arm as he turns towards her. The female saint (thought to be Mary Salome) next to Joseph of Arimathea looks towards him as he holds the crown of thorns. Gamaliel has his arms crossed against his chest and next to him another holds a pot of embalming oil. Joseph of Arimathea, the largest of the figures portrayed, stands in silhouette and prepares to cover the body with the shroud he is holding. * In the resurrection scene the two sleeping guards sit on either side of the tomb whilst another is stretched out fast asleep on the ground in front of the tomb. There are two other soldiers in the rear who are just awakening. Jesus emerges from the tomb lifting one arm to give a blessing. Also at the front of the west face there is a small statue of St Thégonnec. Christ being mocked Roland Doré's depiction of Jesus being mocked The \\"Christ aux outrages\\" sculpture at St Thégonnec was added by Roland Doré.

Zitnansky has established a Slovak record-breaking throw of 67.20 m in the discus at Nacht van Volharding in Beveren, Belgium. Zitnansky made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he competed as part of the newly formed Slovak team in the men's discus throw. He unleashed the discus into the field with a throw of 51.50 m on his third attempt, finishing thirty-eighth overall in the prelims. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Zitnansky qualified for his second Slovak team, as a 33-year-old, in the men's discus throw at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Less than two months before the Games, Zitnansky threw the discus of 64.25 m to achieve an Olympic B-standard at the track and field class \\"A\\" meet in Vienna, Austria. Unlike his previous Olympic feat, Zitnansky steadily recorded a 53.30-metre throw on his opening attempt in the prelims. Followed by a single foul and a throw slightly shorter than his first by 1.43 m on his next two attempts, Zitnansky finished thirty-sixth in the overall standings against a field of thirty-nine athletes, and did not advance further to the final.

Biography Founded as a school rock-band in 1999 by Edi Krakov (keyboards, composing) and Teddy Shvets (vocals, lyrics), Stormy Atmosphere stepped into the progressive genre in 2002 . Since then it has been self-promoted by the band members, setting shows and festivals with other local bands and several booking agencies. In 2012, Stormy Atmosphere made it to the finals of the Israeli \\"Metal Battle\\" contest; the winning band went on to represent Israel that year at the annual Wacken Open Air festival. Later the same year, the band took part in the ProgStage festival in Israel, featuring Pain of Salvation and The Flower Kings, among other progressive bands. In December 2014, Stormy Atmosphere went on tour across Slovakia and Poland, with Mike Terrana and his band as the headliners. The concerts were in Nitra, Warsaw, Domecko and Krosno. In April 2015, the band was invited to Georgia, to perform at Tbilisi Jam!Fest 2015, where they performed alongside Slot, Diary of Dreams, Vader, and many other bands. Stormy Atmosphere members were also asked to be a jury for the local \\"Metal Battle 2015\\" contest. In May 2015, Stormy Atmosphere signed up with Metal Scrap Records. The band's second album Pent Letters was released worldwide under the label on September 14, 2015. As a part of a promotion of the new album, Stormy Atmosphere made a tour across Ukraine between 30.09.2015 and 04.10.2015. The concerts occurred in five cities: Kiev, Kharkiv, Odessa, Kirovograd and Kryvyi Rih. During the tour Stormy Atmosphere was supported by several local bands and a Greek band \\"Sunlight\\". In October 2015 Stormy Atmosphere participated in an international festival \\"Melodic Alliance\\" in Israel, with Elvenking and \\"Airborn\\" from Italy, Winter's Verge from Cyprus and three local bands. In December 2016 the band took part in a second festival \\"Melodic Alliance 2\\", this time with Serenity, Civil War, and local power-metal band Desert, who arranged the festival In December 2017 Stormy Atmosphere made their another International Tour, this time in Canada. Eventually the band made only three shows - two in Toronto and one in Ottawa. Band members *Dina Shulman – lead vocals *Teddy Shvets – lead vocals, lyrics *Edi Krakov – keyboards, composing *Ofir Lidor – lead guitar *Jess Sokolenko – bass *Aviv Zohar - drums Discography =Colorblind (2006 - 2009)= In 2006, Stormy Atmosphere members decided to record their first album, Colorblind. The main idea of the album is to show that since everyone has different perspectives, the real truth is hidden from the most. Some of the songs the album consists of were written during early years of the band's performances, and some were made specifically for Colorblind. Three years later, in 2009, the band released the album, which was reissued in 2012 by the record label MALS, and has been noted and reviewed by several metal magazines and webzines in Israel and worldwide. =Pent Letters (2009 – 2014)= In 2009, Stormy Atmosphere began working on the second album, Pent Letters. This time it is a conceptual album, which took one story and followed it across all the songs. The story told inside is quite harsh, but does have a few positive conclusions, and might make people think: A young man is put behind US prison walls for a crime that remains an enigma to the listener, who can just hope to find answers in the band future albums. He has a young woman who stays outside to wait for him, despared and impatient. Being inside the hero has to find a way to survive in a hostile society, and that's when he finds answers in the books from the joint library. When he manages to help himself, he then does everything to save his woman, sending inspiring letters to her (probably the origin of the album's name). Tom Englund appears in the album as a guest star. Pent Letters was finished in October 2014. and was released worldwide under the Metal Scrap Records label in September 2015.

Madilog is an Indonesian acronym that stands for Materialisme Dialektika Logika (literally, Materialism Dialectics Logics). It is a synthesis of Marxist dialectical materialism and Hegelian logic. Madilog was written in Batavia where Malaka was hiding during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, disguised as a tailor. If Malaka's essay \\"Naar de Republiek Indonesië\\" (\\"Towards a Republic of Indonesia\\") published in 1928, under the Dutch East Indies government, stands as a formulation of the national identity of Indonesia, then Madilog stands as an anticlimax of his ideas in the sense of building the Indonesian character in modern society. Although Madilog is based on Marxism, it neither implements the Marxist view nor tries to establish a cultural pattern based on Marxism. Madilog is purely Malaka's nationalist perspective by way of being influenced by Hegelian dialectics, Feuerbach's materialism, Marx's views of scientific reason, and logical positivism. The book is to be a new alternative to the usual Indonesian way of thinking and movement, of a people living on thousands of islands, with hundreds languages and cultures, with most believing in mystical logic (Indonesian: logika mistika). In the first three chapters, the book emphasizes that Indonesian social classes differ from those of European society, thus unmodified Marxism cannot be applied due to ontological differences. History Madilog was written by Tan Malaka in Rawajati, near a shoe factory in Kalibata, Pantjoran, Batavia. Malaka stayed there between 1942 and 1943 as a tailor, while inspecting the condition of the city and kampungs in Batavia, from where he left over 20 years before. He spent 720 hours writing Madilog, over 8 months from July 1942 to March 1943, spending approximately 3 hours a day on the book and Gabungan Aslia (Aslia Merged), which was written at the same time. Publication had to be postponed due to lack of money and being under strict supervision of the Japanese Keibodan during World War II, from 1942 to 1945, when Indonesian independence was declared. While writing Madilog, Malaka served as Chairman of the Agency to Aid Defense (Indonesian old-spelling: Badan Pembantoe Pembelaan, BPP) and as Chairman of the Agency to Help Worker Soldiers (Indonesian old-spelling: Badan Pembantoe Pradjoerit Pekerdja, BP3), to help forced laborers (Romusha). He was eventually elected as representative for Bantam to the Young Generation Congress (Indonesian old- spelling: Congres Angkatan Moeda, Dutch: Congres van de Jonge Generatie), but his swearing-in was cancelled. In Bantam, he met some Indonesian nationalist youth activists such as Sukarni, Chaerul Saleh, and Wikana, who would be known as members of Persatuan Perdjuangan in Surakarta in 1948. Madilog introduced the Madilog idea. It was first self-published in 1943, using the pen name Iljas Hussein, and 568 pages in length. In the post-independence era, Madilog was published by Widjaya Publisher, in 1951, in Jakarta. Madilog was translated into Dutch by Ted Sprague and was published in 1962 in The Hague.Poeze, Harry A. 1999. \\"Tan Malaka: Pergulatan Menuju Republik 1925-1945\\".

Life Eggstein lived and worked as a brewer in his home town of Burgau. He was married, with two sons and a daughter. The Bavarian Constitution of 1818 set up an elected popular assembly for the Kingdom of Bavaria, known as the Bayerische Ständeversammlung, based in Munich and consisting of a chamber of Imperial Councillors and a chamber of deputies. Eggstein was elected in the very first elections in December, chosen from the fifth class and representing the Upper Danube area (Oberdonaukreis) in the chamber of deputies. The deputies came to the Landtag's grand opening in Munich on 1 February 1819. The sessions lasted until the end of the parliament on 25 July 1819 and its legislative term as a whole lasted until 1825, with its members usually only in the chamber when summoned and otherwise back in their home towns working on their regular jobs.Website on the first Landtag of Bavaria In 1819, during his first period at the Landstag from 1819, Eggstein had rented a room at the Gasthof Döllerer in the Tal district of Munich. There he suffered an erysipelas on the head and died suddenly in his room on 13 March 1819.Allgemeine Zeitung München, Nr. 78 vom 19.

Eggstein had been in the Burgau militia since 1803, reaching the rank of Hauptmann and so was buried in his uniform and with a company of the Munich militia as funeral escort. According to his obituary in volume 13 of the proceedings of the Chamber of Deputies of Bavaria, his gravestone read \\"He was an active householder, an honest brewer, a loyal husband, a righteous father, a pious Catholic Christian, an honourable man concerned for his fatherland's welfare.\\" Due to his sudden death, it also bore Bernard of Clairvaux's saying \\"Because death awaits you everywhere, expect him everywhere, if you want to be wise\\".

Remaudière (1997), Catalogue of the World’s Aphididae, INRA, Paris 473 pp is an aphid in the superfamily Aphidoidea in the order Hemiptera. It is a true bug and feeds on the leaves of Gramineae (grass) family members. Its original distribution is the Palaearctic, but it has been introduced to other parts of the world. It is one of about 40 recognized Schizaphis species worldwide.Bugguide.net. Genus Schizaphis Description Adult greenbugs are long. The head and thorax are straw-colored to pale green and the abdomen is mid-green, with a dark green dorsal stripe in late-stage nymphs and adults. The antennae are dark and the cornicles are pale with dark tips. Early in the season the adults are wingless, but under conditions of over-crowding, winged forms appear and migrate to neighbouring plants. Host plants This aphid feeds almost exclusively on a range of grasses in the family Poaceae; genera attacked include Agropyron, Avena, Bromus, Dactylis, Eleusine, Festuca, Hordeum, Lolium, Oryza, Panicum, Poa, Sorghum, Triticum and Zea. Ecology Adults infesting Sorghum bicolor In warm or moderate climates, the greenbug reproduces by parthenogenesis, female insects producing nymphs at the rate of up to five per day on paspalum near the Florida coast. There are three instar stages and a generation length of seven to nine days at . In cooler climates, females mate in the autumn with winged males, and the eggs overwinter on such grasses as Poa pratensis. Within the Post-Soviet states there can be up to fifteen generations in the year and the most favourable temperature is around for wingless forms, and for winged ones. When feeding on grasses, the aphids suck the sap and at first cause yellow or red spots on the leaves. As the greenbugs become more numerous, the plant progressively develop yellow and red hues, leaves die, roots die and in extreme cases, the whole plant succumbs. On susceptible cultivars of small grain crops, the plant size and yield are affected. In turf grass, the tips and blades of the leaves turn yellow with brown tips, which contrasts strongly with healthy leaves. As the leaves die back, the aphids move on to fresh foliage. The greenbug is the vector of several plant viruses including barley yellow dwarf virus, sugarcane mosaic virus, maize dwarf mosaic virus and millet red leaf virus.

DeLand (December 27, 1872 – March 27, 1947, also spelled Deland or De Land) was an American painter and illustrator. Though he is relatively unknown today, DeLand was one of the first graduates of Howard Pyle's class at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now Drexel University) alongside names like N. C. Wyeth. His paintings hang in many galleries around the world and his illustrations have remained in print in illustrated editions of such works as Charles Chesnutt's The Wife of His Youth. Life and Early Education Clyde Osmer DeLand was born in Union City, Pennsylvania to Theodore and Nancy Howard DeLand, of Pennsylvania. Theodore Deland apparently worked as a machinist around the time that Clyde was born.1880 United States Federal Census The census actually lists Theodore's occupation as \\"Machist,\\" most likely a shorthand for \\"machinist\\" After graduating from Rochester High School, Clyde DeLand enrolled at the University of Rochester in 1891 but stayed for only a year. In that time, he also joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. In a later profile on the artist, fellow Delta Upsilon brother Fullerton L. Waldo suggests that \\"while in Rochester an alternative career proposed itself to DeLand in the cognate art of music ... DeLand practised (sic) and studied the piano till he became a really proficient concert pianist and teacher, and only by the narrowest margin did he miss electing music as his permanent calling.\\" This seems to be corroborated by a record of a solo performance of \\"War Veteran's March\\" given by young DeLand following the address of Lieutenant-Governor Edward F. Jones at the Eighth Annual Convention of the Woman's Relief Corps in Rochester in 1890. Howard Pyle and the Drexel Institute DeLand enrolled in the Drexel Institute in 1894, the same year that artist Howard Pyle began his teaching career there. It would seem, as his career would later attest, that DeLand was inspired by Pyle's pedagogical emphasis on historical verisimilitude in art. As O'Hara relates that during modeling sessions at Drexel it was not uncommon that \\"[Pyle] brought in period artifacts and props to create the feel, and even the smell, of another time and to stress the importance of accuracy in details.\\" When Pyle founded the School of Illustration at Drexel in 1896, DeLand was among the first class under the new cirriculum, which placed importance on preparing and promoting students for publication. Beginning in the summer of 1898, Pyle and Drexel instituted a special summer program through the School of Illustration which would take on a select few students and allow them, provided with special scholarships, to study with Pyle over the summer. These would take place not on campus, but in and around Pyle's personal studios at Chadds Ford, Delaware, near his native Wilmington. Along with their mentor's connections and recommendations, Pyle's students were featured in an annual summer exhibition at Drexel, in which they could promote themselves for publication. Thus, Jill and Robert May relate an anecdote in which Pyle is asked to display some of his art in exhibition: > In Boston, Ross Turner was planning an exhibition of colonial times and > asked if he could have something by Pyle in the show, expressly identifying > The First Salute to the Flag as a work that he would like to display. Pyle > replied that the specific picture sought was actually by \\"Mr. Clyde O. > DeLand, a pupil of mine,\\" adding that he believed the picture was \\"in the > possession of the Harpers.\\" He offered to contact DeLand and ask that he > \\"look the matter up.\\" Indeed, many of the students used the summer program and the exhibition in order to work on and display illustrations for which they had already signed contracts. DeLand was showing several such works in the 1898 Drexel summer exhibition, and by the end of the next year, he had procured more illustration contracts from such publishers as Houghton Mifflin. After he graduated from Pyle's classes, in either 1898 or 1899, DeLand moved back to his native Philadelphia to begin a \\"relatively modest career\\" as a professional illustrator.The entry for DeLand in John Leonard's Who's Who in Philadelphia tells us that he \\"was graduated from the Drexel Institute in 1898\\" while other sources such as the Mays' book on Howard Pyle mentions DeLand's continued involvement in exhibitions associated with Pyle and the School of Illustration through 1899. Perhaps it is the case that DeLand graduated from Drexel and continued to participate in the Chadds Ford summer program afterwards. Selected bibliography Beginning around 1899, DeLand became an increasingly visible presence in American popular fiction. His name appears as illustrator on many title pages following some of the top authors of his day.

He is forced to take a lonely path during the aftermath of these events as he forms new friendships with the unlikeliest of people. Throughout his journey, Prem experiences an array of revelations in sometimes surreal circumstances as he builds towards his growth as a young man.

Production =Development= The series idea was initially conceived in an attempt to bring an unconventional drama series format to a national television audience incorporating experimental techniques familiar in independent and art house films. A pilot episode was originally shot during 2013 on a budget of £1,000 funded entirely by series creator, Rohith S. Katbamna and co-producer, Terry Mardi. Casting for the pilot involved over 100 performers attending a two-day audition. Performers ranged from professional actors to those who had never acted prior. The process aimed to find performers/people with similar qualities or had personally experienced certain situations as their on-screen characters. It was the director's intention to cast all unknowns. The title role of Prem Mehta was cast to purposefully go against the mainstream screen look of teenagers. Karanvir Bhupal partly earned the role of Prem Mehta for his distinctive appearance. After the pilot was completed, it was pitched as a six-part drama series to the Community Channel - a UK broadcaster known primarily for factual content. The series was dubbed as an experimental drama and would contain influences ranging from avant-garde to social realism. Along with an acquisition fee from the Community Channel, a Kickstarter campaign to raise £35,000 between April - June 2014 took place. The campaign was successful raising £35,333, however this total was reduced to £31,893.77 after administration fees from Kickstarter were collected. =Music= The score is composed by South African musician, John Atterbury. The composition involved a process of fusing audio manipulation and live instrumentation, concurrently with tape loops, recordings in the field and programming to present the most organic and contemporary sound possible. This entire process concluded with a music score consisting of 97 tracks for all six episodes of PREMature, including the final song, \\"The Start\\", featuring vocals by London singer/musician, Donna Thompson. The theme for the UK trailers was composed by London-based musician Roly Witherow, who had heard about the series through Kickstarter and contacted the director. Broadcast =United Kingdom= The series began airing on the Community Channel from 22 February 2015 at a post-watershed time slot due to mature content. This initial broadcast run was made available online to UK based users on two platforms (TVPlayer and TVCatchup) where viewers are able to stream live television. =Availability= The entire series was made available on YouTube in January 2018. Themes With teenage characters at the helm of the story, PREMature delves into issues such as bullying in the form of physical, verbal, psychological and online. Also highlighted are teen anxiety, depression, isolation, identity, drugs and relationships. The one constant is that Prem is forced to confront the divorce of his parents and his grandmother's death simultaneously whilst his friend Will struggles in a single-parent home with his deeply troubled mother. Throughout the relationship between Nina and Darren, existential discussions are heard questioning existence, social behaviour and the reluctance to accept happiness. Nina talks of cynicism and doubting her place in life whilst Darren attempts to counter these feelings with optimism. Death is a prominent theme that carries on throughout the series particularly the effect of losing someone close and how certain characters are forced to confront and deal with this new absence from their lives. The way in which a teenager and an adult deal with this theme is examined through their respective paths taken At times, the story shifts into moments of surreal and often psychedelic sequences that exhibit the inner thoughts and subconscious state of minds of certain characters when found in specific situations of heightened tension or isolation.

The son of a poor merchant family from Brașov, he attended several universities before launching a career as a critic, first in his native town and then in Czernowitz. Eventually settling in Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Old Kingdom, he managed to earn a university degree before teaching at a succession of high schools. Meanwhile, he continued publishing literary studies as well as intensifying an ardently nationalistic, Pan-Romanian activism. He urged the Romanian government to drop its neutrality policy and enter World War I; once this took place and his adopted home came under German occupation, he found himself arrested and deported to Bulgaria. After the war's conclusion and the union of Transylvania with Romania, he became a literature professor at the newly founded Cluj University. There, he served as rector in the late 1920s, but found himself increasingly out of touch with modern trends in literature. Biography =Origins, education and early career= He was born in Brașov, in the Transylvania region. His father Ioan (1832–1906) was a struggling small businessman who was forced to liquidate his store, leave his family and become a clerk in Sinaia, in the Romanian Old Kingdom; by the late 1880s, he was at a glass factory in nearby Azuga. His mother Elena (née Munteanu; 1846–1911) raised seven boys and four girls. The oldest son, Ioan Bogdan, would become a historian and philologian. Four of the sons earned university degrees, while a sister, Ecaterina, married Nicolae Iorga in 1901.Ioan Bogdan, Scrieri alese, pp. 9-10\\\\. Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste România, Bucharest, 1968 Gheorghe Bogdan attended Romanian-language elementary and high school in his native city;Nastasă (2007), p. 314 his teachers at the latter institution included Ioan Meșotă, Ioan Alexandru Lapedatu and Andrei Bârseanu. He graduated in 1885, and obtained a scholarship for the University of Budapest, where he remained a year. He transferred to the University of Jena, where he studied philosophy, and then took courses at the University of Vienna from 1887 to 1888.Vedinaș, p. 64George Bogdan-Duică (ed. Dumitru Petrescu), Studii și articole, pp. xlii–xliii. Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1975 He started publishing criticism at an early age in the Romanian-language newspapers of Transylvania. After his studies abroad, he worked for Gazeta Transilvaniei and then for the Sibiu- based Tribuna; his beginnings as a critic coincided with the early career of George Coșbuc, whom he helped with numerous reviews. He prided himself on being an intellectual disciple of Titu Maiorescu, and was writing for the latter's Convorbiri Literare by 1888. In the autumn of 1889, he was named a part-time teacher at the high school he had attended, but was soon fired after a conflict with the administration caused by his quick temper. While in Brașov, he frequently attended social gatherings for the young Romanian women of Brașov, where he delivered public readings and sought to awaken the participants' interest in literature.Nastasă (2010), p. 130 Subsequently entering the Austrian province of Bukovina, he settled in its capital of Czernowitz (Cernăuți), where he edited Gazeta Bucovinei from May 1893 to August 1894 and sought to raise popular interest in Romanian writers in a province that was fairly disconnected from the cultural life of the Old Kingdom. While there, he published a biography of Petru Maior in 1893, and in 1894 translated Ion Budai-Deleanu's German-language notes on Bukovina into Romanian.Al. Piru, Istoria literaturii române: epoca premodernă, p. 124. Editura didactică și pedagogică, Bucharest, 1970 Also that year, he wrote a study of the Romanian Orthodox Church's autonomy in the province; while in 1895, he published a volume on Bukovina that was the first to closely analyze its economic, cultural and political profile. Commenting on contemporary literature, he offered favorable reviews for Coșbuc, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, Ioan Slavici and Alexandru Vlahuță, citing them as examples of a national and original literature. He then returned to Transylvania, focusing on the area's history and writing books on Visarion Sarai and on the interrogation of Inocențiu Micu-Klein (both 1896), as well as on the demographic situation of Romanians in Hungary in 1733. Other subjects of his biographies included Gheorghe Lazăr, Eftimie Murgu and Simion Bărnuțiu. While in Transylvania, he once again worked for Tribuna, and formed part of Astra's leadership until August 1897. He then enrolled in the University of Bucharest, located in the capital of the Old Kingdom, where he finally earned a degree in literature in 1897.Nastasă (2007), p. 315 For political reasons, but also because Bucharest was far closer to his native city than Budapest, where he also might have chosen to live,Nastasă (2007), p. 294 he remained there for a period of time following his graduation. From Bucharest, he was one of the chief contributors to Tribuna. His objectives included making the reading public aware of important literature published in the 1880–1888 period; sharply criticizing the pseudo-celebrities of the day; and especially the popularization of aesthetic writings such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Laocoön and Hippolyte Taine's The Philosophy of Art, which had both recently appeared in translation.Iancu, p. 68 He also returned to teaching in 1897, first offering German courses in Curtea de Argeș and then moving to Focșani and Galați. By 1899, he was desperate to relocate to the capital, with its rich institutions, worldly attractions and diverse population. He wrote from Focșani asking his mentor Ioan Bianu to intervene on his behalf with Education Minister Spiru Haret. He was duly appointed to Bucharest's Dimitrie Cantemir High School, where he taught from 1899 to 1909, and finally ended his high school career at Mihai Viteazul High School in the same city, from 1909 to 1919.Nastasă (2007), pp. 259, 294 He eventually became director of the latter institution. =Political involvement= Continuing to live in Bucharest in the early years of the 20th century, he was associated with the traditional conservative circles of Junimea and Iorga. By 1899, together with Coșbuc, Iorga, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ovid Densusianu, he was among the contributors to România jună. He wrote an ample number of literary studies and made significant contributions to the history of 19th century Romanian literature. Reviews that published his work included Convorbiri Literare, Sămănătorul, Ramuri and Viața Românească in the Old Kingdom, as well as Transylvanian outlets such as Luceafărul and Tribuna Poporului. Some of these studies, such as a 1906 analysis of literary historiography, methodically analyzed their subject. Others investigated foreign influence on native writers, and included a 1901 book on German influence during the time of Budai-Deleanu, a 1904 study of Salomon Gessner in Romanian literature, a work on the sources of Vasile Alecsandri from the same year, a 1905 look at Friedrich Schiller's local influence, and a commentary on August von Kotzebue's Romanian translators. He usually shed new light on Romanian writers' lives and works, drawing on old magazines and gazettes, contemporary accounts and the authors' correspondence.Iancu, p. 69 Together with Ioan Russu-Șirianu, he established the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians in 1891.Răzvan Pârâianu, \\"Culturalist Nationalism and Anti-Semitism in Fin-de-Siècle Romania\\", in Marius Turda, Paul Weindling (eds.), Blood and Homeland: Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900–1940, pp. 365-66\\\\. Central European University Press, 2007, He was a member of the \\"Tribunist\\" wing (so called after Tribuna) of the Romanian National Party (PNR), which strongly supported publication of the Transylvanian Memorandum.Stefano Santoro, Dall’Impero asburgico alla Grande Romania. Il nazionalismo romeno di Transilvania fra Ottocento e Novecento, pp. 95-6\\\\. FrancoAngeli, Milan, 2014, Particularly through his writings in Sămănătorul and Luceafărul, he became associated with a radical nationalist ideology that fit with the two magazines' Pan-Romanianism. An ardent patriot who frequently veered into an exclusivist chauvinism, he published Românismul (\\"Romanianism\\") from 1913 to 1914, drawing a contrast between his Pan-Romanian outlook and Pan-Slavism as well as Pan-Germanism. A prominent anti-Semite, he published Românii și Ovreii (\\"The Romanians and the Jews\\") in 1913.Centrul pentru Studiul Istoriei Evreilor din România, (ed. Ileana Popovici), Evreii din România în secolul XX, vol. 1, p. 102. Editura Hasefer, 2003, 978-9736-30034-9 Upon the outbreak of World War I, together with fellow Transylvanians Octavian Goga and Vasile Lucaciu, advocated for neutral Romania's entry into the war on the side of the Allies. After Bucharest was occupied by the Central Powers in 1916, his loose talk about an impending German defeat led to his denouncement and arrest, in early June 1917.Lucian Boia, \\"Germanofilii\\". Elita intelectuală românească în anii Primului Război Mondial, p. 213. Humanitas, Bucharest, 2010, Initially held at Săveni, he was taken hostage and deported to Troyan in Bulgaria. Despite his older brother's intercessions on his behalf, he spent nine months in captivity before being freed near the end of the war. Subsequently, he returned to his post of high school director, holding it until November 1919. =Postwar period and legacy= At that point, following the union of Transylvania with Romania and the creation of Cluj University, he was named a professor in the history of modern Romanian literature, proposed by Sextil Pușcariu. He served as dean of the literature and philosophy faculty in 1919–1920, as rector of the university in 1927–1928 and as vice rector in 1928–1929. He never earned a doctorate, although he did supervise numerous dissertations. He was a commander of the Order of the Crown, as well as an Officier de l'Instruction Publique.

Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică, Bucharest, 1986 Subsequently, he migrated to the National Liberal Party.Nastasă (2007), p. 300 In a 1922 biography of Ion Ionescu de la Brad, he classified the latter as \\"the first Romanian peasantist\\", and synthesized his ideas on \\"progressive agriculture\\". He wrote a history of modern Romanian literature in 1923; George Călinescu dismissed this as being without aesthetic taste, calling its author \\"completely misunderstanding and disoriented\\". As early as 1926, he set himself up as a leading faculty opponent of hiring Lucian Blaga at Cluj, and by the following year, had launched a public campaign, offensive in tone, to discredit the poet.Nastasă (2010), pp. 375-76 His conservative disposition, stubborn spirit, and scientist and historicist opinions stood in contrast with the poet's mysticism,Nastasă (2010), pp. 376-77 and his intransigence grew as he aged.Nastasă (2010), p. 377 By 1931, he was writing a series of defamatory articles called Literatură fără rost (firește de Lucian Blaga) (\\"Pointless Literature (of Course by Lucian Blaga))\\",Nastasă (2010), p. 378 and his death three years later appeared to remove a major obstacle to the hire.Nastasă (2010), p. 379 According to a later critic, although Bogdan-Duică documented a series of remarkable figures, his cultural references were those of a 19th- century scholar, despite the fact that his most important work was written in the 20th. Bogdan-Duică suffered from strabismus.Nastasă (2010), p. 249 In April 1892, at Brașov's St. Nicholas Church, he married Maria Done, a teacher of French from Lutran, Alsace. The couple had six children, just one of whom followed a literary career; their second son was the painter Catul Bogdan. Two of the children predeceased their father, with one dying at age 10. Maria died in 1917, while her husband was imprisoned in Bulgaria. After a relatively short interval, he married Constanța (née Hanea, married Ingescu), who was educated in Sibiu, worked as a teacher in the Old Kingdom and later headed a kindergarten in Cluj.Nastasă (2007), p. 156Nastasă (2010), pp. 285, 325, 362Ion Colan, \\"Cîteva date despre familia lui Ioan Bogdan\\", p. 274.

In his last years, he built an imposing house in Sibiu, intending to retire there.Nastasă (2010), p. 362 He died suddenly in a hotel in Brașov, where he was staying as head of a baccalaureate committee; the cause was an aneurysm brought on by diabetes.Nastasă (2010), p. 438-39 Taken to Sibiu, where he lay in state in the Astra Palace, his funeral was held at Sibiu Orthodox Cathedral and officiated by Nicolae Bălan.

Life He was the eldest son of Alexander Pennecuik of Newhall, Edinburgh, who had been a surgeon under Johan Banér in the Thirty Years' War, and afterwards in the Scottish army of the First English Civil War in England. After foreign travel, he cared for his father, who lived to age 90. Pennecuik was in practice as a physician in Tweeddale, and on good terms with a number of Scottish men of letters. In 1702 his elder daughter married, and Pennecuik gave with her the estate of Newhall. Her husband, however, got into debt, and in 1703 Newhall was sold to Sir David Forbes, father to John Forbes, Pennecuik's friend and Allan Ramsay's patron. Pennecuik lived at Romanno until his death in 1722. He was buried in the churchyard at Newlands, by his father's side. Works Pennecuik published poetical pieces: * Caledonia Triumphans, broadside, 1699, reprinted in David Laing's Various Pieces of Fugitive Scotch Poetry, 1823. * A Panegyric to the King, broadside, 1699. * The Tragedy of Graybeard, 1700. * Lintoun Address to his Highness the Prince of Orange, broadside, 1714; this piece was first printed in the first part of James Watson's Choice Collection of Scots Songs, 1706. Pennecuik's works were reprinted at Edinburgh in 1762, as A Collection of curious Scots Poems … by Alexander Pennecuik; at Leith in 1815, with notes; and again at Edinburgh in 1875. The poems are sometimes in Scottish dialect. At the request of Sir Robert Sibbald, who was writing about the counties of Scotland, Pennecuik wrote a description of Tweeddale with his friend the advocate John Forbes of Newhall; it appeared as A Geographical, Historical Description of the Shire of Tweeddale, with a Miscellany and curious Collection of Select Scottish Poems (1715). Pennecuik corresponded with the botanist James Sutherland. He has been confused with another Alexander Pennecuik (died 1730), said to be his nephew, a writer of verse.

The ruins in winter Postcard of the monastery buildings and church around 1910 Interior of the church around 1896 The Franziskaner-Klosterkirche was a church in the Mitte district of Berlin, founded in 1250 and now in ruins. History It was founded in 1250 in the early Gothic style as a monastery church for a Franciscan house. It was a fieldstone church, 52 metres long and 16 metres wide. Its remains can be found in the north wall of the present ruins. This was replaced with a three-aisled brick basilica church, begun at the end of the 13th century and completed in the first half of the 14th century, whose ruins still survive. In 1365 Louis II, Elector of Brandenburg was buried there. Around 1500 it was renovated. The monastery was closed due to the Protestant Reformation's arrival in Berlin in 1539. None of the monastic buildings survive, though some of them housed Berlin's first printing press from 1571 and the Evangelisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster from 1574. Pupils and teachers at the latter included Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn, whilst Otto von Bismarck also visited the church. Leonhard Thurneysser ran the printing press and also restored the church between 1583 and 1584. Small modifications were made in the second half of the 17th century, such as demolishing the old staircase tower, building a new timber staircase on the west side and in 1712 demolishing the rood screen separating the nave from the chancel. 1712 also saw a fire in the church's roof and in 1719 the church was restored, raising the floor level by 1 metre and bricking up two northern choir windows. Extensive renovations were carried out in the first half of the 19th century - the gabled tower was demolished in 1826, two new towers were built on the west side in 1842, a new sacristy was built and the floor lowered again. Plans were produced for the work by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Christian Gottlieb Cantian and the former track-inspector Berger was preceded by the construction work - Berger's second design was that ultimately implemented. Work lasted until 1845, though the church was closed due to severe damp in its masonry in 1902 and in 1926 most of the 19th century changes were reversed. The church was re-consecrated on 24 May 1936. The church was destroyed on 3 April 1945 in the bombing of Berlin in World War II. In 1950 the debris was removed and the church ruins secured between 1959 and 1963, although the ruined monastic buildings were demolished completely to make way for a park. The ruins were restored again in 2003-2004 and are now used for exhibitions, plays and concerts. Bibliography *Kirchenruine des Grauen Klosters in Berlin. Hrsg. vom Landesdenkmalamt Berlin.

His career flourished in the southeastern Caucasus, where he ran the governments of Barda and Kakheti on behalf of Shah Abbas I until being overthrown in a Georgian uprising in 1625.  Governor  Paykar Beg, the future khan, was a leader of the Turkic tribe of Igirmi Durt, who vied with other Qizilbash factions over the influence in Karabakh. On the order of Shah Ismail II, Paykar killed his cousin Yusof Khalife ibn Shahverdi Khan Ziyadoghlu, beglarbeg of Karabakh, and Yūsof’s mother and brothers, expecting appointment as beglarbeg. Ismail, however, gave the position to a member of the rival Qajar clan. Paykar rose to influence in 1608, when Shah Abbas I appointed him governor of Barda. Around 1620, he was, further, given the governorship of Kakheti, a neighboring Georgian kingdom, which the shah sought to bring under his full control. On this occasion, Abbas gave to Paykar in marriage Lela (Fatma Sultan Begum), a royal princess from another Georgian kingdom, that of Kartli, whom the shah dismissed from his harem after having her brother, King Luarsab II of Kartli, executed. On his appointment in Kakheti, Paykar Khan settled in the fortress of Qarlanquch (Khornabuji) where he built a town with fine homes and bathes. Following the shah's order, he brought some 15,000 households of Igirmi Durt Imuru, Zolqadar, Solayman Hajlu, and Kurds of Azerbaijan for resettlement in Kakheti. The country lay depopulated and in ruins; tens of thousands of Georgians had been deported to the remote provinces of the Safavid empire and those who remained hid in the forests and mountains. Paykar Khan's vizier was Fazli Isfahani Khuzani, who subsequently wrote the chronicle Afżal al- tawārikh, an important source for the history of Shah Abbas's campaigns in the Caucasus and Georgian affairs.  Downfall  Paykar Khan's rule in Kakheti was brought to an end, in 1625, by the rebellion of the shah's Georgian officer Giorgi Saakadze (Murav-Beg), who had killed the Safavid commander Qarachaqay Khan and destroyed his army camp at Martq'op'i. He was in alliance with Zurab, Duke of Aragvi, whom Saakadze had promised the hand of Lela, Paykar Khan's wife. Paykar Khan was at this time on a mission to eliminate the pockets of Georgian refugees in the forests of Kakheti. On hearing the news that the Georgian troops were advancing towards Qarlanquch, he hastily returned to his headquarters and fled with his wife and tribe. They succeeded in crossing the Kura river safely, but lost many of fellow clansmen, much cattle, and booty to the pursuing Georgians, who carried their raid far into Ganja and Karabakh.

Much of her career was spent teaching business at the university level. Retired from active teaching, she is the former president of Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), an inductee into the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame, and currently a regent of the Regional University System of Oklahoma. Early life Dr. Joe Anna Hibler was born on May 5, 1939 in Shattuck, OK. Soon after Hibler was born, her family moved to Leedey, OK where she spent most of her early life going to school. Hibler graduated from Leedey High School. Her parents both worked in school teaching and administration. Hibler later told an interviewer that, \\"...a woman had three career choices: a teacher, nurse or secretary,” She also said, \\"I didn’t like the sight of blood and knew I didn’t want to be a teacher, so I chose business.\\" So, she enrolled for a 40-hour course at Southwestern State College that would lead to certification as a secretary. Education Hibler also learned that she loved college and wanted to do more in life than just be a secretary. She also found business courses fascinating, so, she decided to become a business teacher. In three years, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College, now named Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), and her master's degree from Oklahoma State University, both in business education. From 1969 to 1971, Dr. Hibler took a sabbatical to work on her doctorate in business education at the University of Oklahoma. While she was at OU, Hibler was hired as a special instructor in the College of Business Administration. Career Upon graduation from Oklahoma State University, Hibler taught business at Altus High School and Altus Junior College for four years. She was then hired by her alma mater, SWOSU, where she stayed for 36 years teaching courses in business as well as holding various administrative positions.

She reached out to alumni and brought them back into the family. The effort has paid off. In 1990, the university foundation collected $840,000. By mid year 2001, the assets totaled over $7 million, and were on track to exceed $10 million by the end of the year. Programs started during her presidency included: * Developed a pharmacy doctorate program; * Started Foss Lake Adventure Program for at- risk youth; * Instituted The Center for Economic and Business Development, serving 13 counties in Southwest Oklahoma.

The massive granite Classical Revival structure was built in 1916 with funding raised by a local citizen group, and originally had a capacity of 72 burials. The mausoleum was designed by Cecil E. Bryan with an interior following a standard plan he used on other small mausoleums. The exterior is what sets this mausoleum apart from others he designed. He was inspired by the works of his former employer, Louis Sullivan. The building deteriorated in condition, and its burials were relocated elsewhere within the cemetery.

All lines from all revisions are \\"woven\\" together in a single block of data, with interspersed control instructions indicating which lines are included in which revisions of the file. Interleaved deltas are traditionally implemented with line oriented text files in mind, although nothing prevents the method from being applied to binary files as well. Interleaved deltas were first implemented by Marc Rochkind in the SCCS in 1975. Its design makes all versions available at the same time, so that it takes the same time to retrieve any revision. It also contains sufficient information to identify the author of each line (blaming) in one block.http://www.basepath.com/aup/talks/SCCS-Slideshow.pdf Rochkind, Marc. “The source code control system (SCCS).” IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 1, no. 4 (1975) On the other hand, because all revisions for a file are parsed, every operation grows slower as more revisions are added. The term interleaved delta was coined later in 1982 by Walter F. Tichy, author of the Revision Control System, which compares the SCCS weave to his new reverse delta mechanism in RCS. Implementation in SCCS In SCCS, the following weave block ^AI 1 ^AD 2 foo ^AE 2 bar ^AI 2 baz ^AE 2 ^AE 1 represents a file that contains the lines \\"foo\\" and \\"bar\\" in the first release and the lines \\"bar\\" and \\"baz\\" in the second revision. The string \\"^A\\" denotes a control-A character. The control lines in the interleaved delta block have the following meaning:http://sccs.sourceforge.net/man/sccsfile.4.html sccsfile(4) manual page * ^AI serial Start a block of lines that was inserted with the named serial number. * ^AD serial Start a block of lines that was removed with the named serial number. * ^AE serial Block end for a corresponding ^AI or ^AD statement that uses the same serial number. Advantages The time it takes to extract any revision from such an interleaved delta block is proportional to the size of the archive. The size of the archive is the sum of the size of all different lines in all revisions. In order to extract a specific revision, an array of structures needs to be constructed, telling whether a specific block, tagged by a serial number in the interleaved deltas, will be copied to the output or not. The original SCCS implementation needs approx. 100 bytes of storage for each different serial number in the deltas in order to know how to extract a specific revision. A SCCS history file with one million deltas would thus need 100 MBytes of virtual memory to unpack. The size could be reduced by approx. 32 bytes per delta if no annotated file retrieval is needed. The advantages of the weave method are the following: * Uniform retrieval time for all revisions of a file. * The possibility to annotate all lines of a file with revision of last change, author of last change and time of last change at no extra costs. * The possibility to merge in non-overlapping branches at no extra costs.

History It was originally the church of a Franciscan monastery built in the second half of the 13th century and first recorded in 1299. It consists of a nave and a choir and is in the Brick Gothic style. The church's original roof timbers survive and have been dated to around 1440 by dendrochronology, suggesting the church was built at the start of the 15th century. A second aisle was built alongside the nave and choir, with the section beside the choir serving as a sacristy. The nave and choir are separated by a brick rood screen. Bavaria was secularized after the Reformation and so the monastery was closed in 1543 - it and the church fell into disrepair. When Huguenots settled in Uckermark, the church was restored and used by them between 1699 and 1788. From 1725 onwards the choir was used as a magazine and the southern monastery (with its two cloisters) was demolished in 1767. The church's vaults were demolished in 1825. During the 19th century and in the Nazi era the church was again restored. After German reunification the church was converted into a meeting hall.

It is a rhizomatous perennial plant, originally from Romania with violet and white flowers. It was once thought to be a subspecies of Iris sintenisii, but now classified as a separate species. It is also called Iris Brandzy or Prodan Iris in Russia. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. Description Iris brandzae is similar in form to Iris sintenisii, but with several differences, including leaf form, flower shape and spathe form.British Iris Society (1997) It has an (un-described) rhizome, which can forms small clumps of plants. It has grass- like leaves that are very narrow, erect, greenish blue, rough or scabrid (to the touch), and not evergreen.Thomas Gaskell Tutin (Editor) They can grow up to between long, and 1.5–3.5 mm wide. The leaves also have 2–5 prominent veins. Unlike Iris sintenisii, it has stems that are generally taller than the leaves, which can grow up to between tall. The stems have strongly inflated, green spathes, (leaves of the flower bud), which also have prominent veining. It has flowers that are similar in form to other dwarf spurias. and they have 2 terminal (top of stem) scented flowers, that begin blooming in the spring, between April and May. They come in shades of blue-violet, deep-blue, or blue- purple. It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'.} Compared to Iris sintenisii, they have narrow mid tepals (the claws) which are narrow. After the iris has flowered, it produces a terracotta coloured seed capsule, in the fall (autumn). =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. In 1948, an analysis was carried out by Tarnavschi, and published as 2n=10. Which does not match with other spuria irises. Other published counts are 2n=20.Andreĭ Aleksandrovich Fedoro (Editor)  Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet brandzae refers to botanist Dimitrie Brândză (1846–1895). It is sometimes called Prodan Iris, or Iris Brandzy in Russia. It was originally published and described as Iris brandzae by Iuliu Prodan in Buletinul Gradinii Botanice si al Muzeului Botanic dela Universitatea din Cluj (Bul. Grad. Bot. Univ. Cluj) Vol.15 page103 in 1935. It was also published by Czerep, in 1973 Svod Dopolm. Izmen Flora SSSR page301 and then by Geiderman in 1975, Opred. Vyssh. Rast. Mold SSR Ed2 page109. It was later published as Iris sintenisii Janka subsp. brandzae (Prod.) D.A. Webb & Chater by D.A. Webb & Chater in the 'Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society' (Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 76.) in 1978,. It was thought to have a more limited geographical distribution than Iris sintenisii, around Romania. It stayed like this for many years until the authors of the Romanian flora books ('Flora a Romanie' by Ciocarlan 2009 and 'Plante Vasculare din Romania. Determinator ilustrat de teren (Vascular Plants of Romania. An illustrated field guide)' by Sarbu, Stefan et Oprea 2013) re-classified the taxon as an independent and separate species. Although some references still call it Iris sintenisii Janka subsp. brandzae. It has not yet been verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service as of February 2015. Iris sintenisii subsp. brandzae, as of February 2015 was a tentatively accepted name by the RHS. Distribution and habitat Iris brandzea is native to Central Europe. =Range= The original specimens were found in Romania. It is also found in Moldavia, Bessarabia, Asia Minor, and the Carpathians, (in Central and Eastern Europe). Although it is more rarely found, than Iris sintenisii. Specifically, it can be found on the plains of Romania and Moldova. =Habitat= It grows in very different habitats to Iris sintenisii. It is a (Mesophyte meaning neither dry or wet habitats). It grows in saline marshes or wet meadows, and forest glades. It has also been found in steppe forest woodland under Fraxinus pallisiae (Ash trees). Conservation In 2003, it (as Iris brandzae) was assessed as 'Rare' in the nature reserve of 'Padurea Harboanca' in Romania. Cultivation Iris brandzae is hardy to USDA Zone 5. It is also hardy in Ukraine. It prefers moist, well drained and humus rich soils. It prefers positions in semi-shade. It is tolerant of wet springs and hot dry summers. Iris brandzae is grown in the Botanic Garden of Iasi Iași Botanical Garden, Romania. In the northern part of the garden, called The Section Moldavia Sylvosteppe, along with other plants such as; Crambe tataria, Echium rossicum, Pulsatilla vulgaris ssp. grandis, Beta trigyna, Dianthus capitatus, Artemisia austriaca, Achillea setacea, Astragalus onobrychis, Hyacinthella leucophaea, Plantago schwarzenbergiana, Rumex tuberosus ssp. tuberosus, Crocus reticulatus, Galium moldavicum, Paeonia tenuifolia and Amygdalus nana. Specimens can be found in Saratov State University, Russia. Specimens can be found growing in the Botanical Garden of Šiauliai University in Lithuania. Culture In 1961, an illustration of Iris brandzae was used on a postage stamp in Romania. It was issued on 15 August 1961, as part of the series '100 years of Bucharest Botanical Garden'.

Largely in response to the great drought of 1933-1934, cattle ranchers acted against their former opposition to the commodification of cattle and appealed to the government for assistance in ridding of themselves of the millions of cattle they could no longer afford to feed or to keep alive without a loss on return. The Jones- Connally Act made cattle a basic commodity, which gave the government authority over the distribution and processing of the cattle for public relief purposes. The act allocated $50 million to the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation for the purchase of dairy and beef products and to the elimination of diseased beef and dairy cattle. The Act was the first of its kind following the Agricultural Adjustment Act to give the FSRC legitimate congressional recognition and some more political bargaining power. Additionally, the act united the meat and dairy industry, who had previously been blaming each other for beef and dairy surpluses in the year leading up to the act. Following the passage of the act, the secretary of agriculture purchased approximately 8.3 million head of cattle at a cost of $111,546,104 for use by the FSRC. 1.5 million of these animals were deemed unfit for human consumption and were buried while the rest were sent to the FSRC for immediate processing. After distribution to commercial packing houses, to SERAs (State Emergency Relief Association) for processing in work relief projects, to temporary pasturage until facilities became available, or for use as dairy or breeder cows, the FSRC had processed 657,396,312 pounds of fresh and canned beef. This represented 3.5% of the average annual consumption of pork and beef.

Argentina and Indonesia were the two biggest exporters of biodiesel to the European Union. Together, they were responsible for about 90% or 2.5mn tonnes of the biodiesel imports of the European Union in 2012. But by mid-2012, the European Union accused Argentina and Indonesia of dumping their biodiesel in the European Union, meaning that they were both selling their biodiesel under the price of the home market and implemented anti-dumping tariffs on biodiesel from the two countries, effectively halting flows. Background According to the findings of the investigations set by the European Union, Argentine and Indonesian companies benefit from an unfair advantage because of the access they have to raw materials at prices that are low compared to the world market prices available to the EU producers of biodiesel. This is because of the high export taxes that the Argentine and Indonesian government imposes on raw materials used in the biodiesel production. The investigation found that the dumping margin of Argentina was around 41.9% and 49.2%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 23.3%. However, by applying the EU “Lesser duty rule”, the anti-dumping duties will be imposed at the level of the injury margin, for most exporting producers, which is for Argentina between 22% and 25.7%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 20.5%. In other Words, the duties were fixed not to constitute a punishment, but to prevent further injury to the EU industry. Definitive Anti-Dumping duties on Biodiesel for Argentina and Indonesia As of November 2013, the EU has imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia. The anti-dumping measures consist of an additional duty of about 24.6% for Argentina and 21.3%, which measures were based on decisions taken by the Council after a 15-month investigation that the European Commission carried out in 2012. The investigation revealed that Argentine biodiesel products were being dumped in the EU market, just as thought by the congress. This Dumping have had a significant negative effect on the financial and operational performance of European producers. Also, the European commission has proposed tariffs of 217 Euros per ton of biodiesel imported, this has caused the sales of the biodiesel imported more expensive than the one produced nationally, causing the sales of the Argentine and Indonesia biodiesel to decrease, considering that the sales had decrease severely due to the strict import laws on biodiesel newly applied. The amount of biodiesel imported to the European Union has decreased a 36% overall in 2013, and just from Argentina's overall imports decreased a 57%. Also, the European government has started to charge a $1 tax per gallon of biodiesel in 2013, and it has constantly been increasing since then, making the biodiesel more expensive for the consumers. So as we can see, Europe has not only decreased the amount of imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia, but from other countries too. As a result, even though the total amount of imports have decreased drastically, the domestic producers of biodiesel have seen a huge increase in sale and in revenues thanks to the taxes and tariffs applied to imports that caused the drops in total imports. =Argentina= Argentina has presented a case (DS459) to a special group against the EU in relations to the biodiesel dispute in May 2013. This case was against certain restrictions in the imports and commercialization of biodiesel in Europe and also claims that say that the European Government is unfairly subsidizing the national biodiesel industry. In October 2016 the dispute panel found in favour of Argentina and ruled that the anti-dumping tariffs must be reduced. The European Commission is in the process of passing these proposals but so far has met with strong opposition from Europe's main biodiesel and oilseed producer states. A decision is expected in September 2017. =Indonesia= In Switzerland, Indonesia has officially launched a complaint against the EU (DS480) at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over anti-dumping tariffs Europe has lodged against Indonesian biodiesel imports since May 2013. The WTO established a dispute panel over similar charges already made by Argentina.

In 1964 he won the David Murray Landscape Award from the Royal Academy, and started a course at the Royal College of Art, but soon gave it up and took up manual work in mines and building sites. At the age of 21, he featured in a BBC TV documentary, The Quiet Rebel, in which he described his commitment to his art and the pressures on him to get a \\"real job\\".

Roger Cecil, Aberystwyth University School of Art. Retrieved 25 February 2015 From the late 1980s, his works were widely exhibited in Wales and elsewhere. He was known for both his figurative and largely abstract paintings, \\"rich in imagery, poetry and colour, which are drawn from his environment, the industrial valley towns and mountains.\\" His works often incorporate everyday materials such as sandpaper, primer, and Polyfilla, as well as conventional paint. The critic Sarah Bradford wrote of his work in 1999: > He is very matter-of-fact about procedure and materials. To him painting is > a very practical thing. The making is important.

Final years and death In later years Cecil suffered from dementia, and before his death had been treated at Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. He was reported as missing from the hospital on 21 February 2015, and was last seen in the early hours of 22 February. After a search, his body was found on 24 February in a field near Cwmbran. Gwent Police treated the death as unexplained. They referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission because a member of the public had spoken to a police officer about Cecil before his body was found. At his inquest on 2 March 2015, Gwent Police said that they had found Cecil's body in the field after a call from a member of the public. Preliminary investigations indicated that he had died from hypothermia. The coroner adjourned the inquest for three months, for further investigations to be completed.

Its title is derived from the \\"happy slapping\\" fad which began in Britain where teens assault strangers on the street, film the encounters on their smartphones and circulate them on mobile phones or post them on user-generated websites. Filmed in Montreal, the film was written and directed by Christos Sourligas and co-written by Andrew Farrar (aka Annakin Slayd) and was shot by the actors on iPhones making it the world’s first feature film shot entirely on smartphones. Plot Five suburban youths embark on a night of violence in the city, attacking unsuspecting victims while recording the assaults on smartphones. They seek out fame by creating an evening so shocking that their camera phone footage will turn them into instant Internet celebrities. After they are rivaled by another gang and intimidated by their online idol, they are forced to take their mischief up a notch if they want to make a name for themselves. Production The film was directed by Canadian filmmaker Christos Sourligas, and written by Sourligas and Andrew Farrar (aka Montreal rapper Annakin Slayd), who has a cameo in the film as one of the victims. Main production was in 2010, but some scenes were added in 2013 to accommodate the \\"selfie\\" craze. The actors acted as cameramen, resulting in a \\"run and gun\\" documentary feel. It was described by The Hollywood Reporter as a film that resembles The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity due to the shakiness of the shots; filmmakers tell of crew members having to run behind walls and other items to avoid being caught on film. Reception Happy Slapping had its world premiere at the 2011 Montreal World Film Festival.

Professional career Poeta joined local club Pallacanestro Salerno in the lower divisions, playing 5 seasons before joining Prima Veroli of the third division. With Veroli he scored 51 points in a 7 November 2005 114-105 victory against Forlì. He moved to first division Serie A club Teramo Basket in 2006. During the 2008-09 season he led the team, coached by former Salerno coach Andrea Capobianco , to the league play-offs. He then joined Virtus Bologna where he had two successful seasons, reaching the play-offs twice and being appointed captain. However after a difficult 2012-13 season where the team finished two places above last place the management decided to change the side, appointing young Matteo Imbrò as the starting point guard. Poeta found himself frozen out of the team, rescinding his contract in November 2013. It was to prove a blessing in disguise as it allowed him to join Laboral Kutxa Vitoria, a team playing in the competitive Liga ACB and Europe's elite EuroLeague, as Thomas Heurtel's substitute. His debut for the side on 12 January 2014 saw him score 13 points in the last quarter against Gipuzkoa to earn a victory. He joined another Liga ACB side for the 2014-15 season, signing with La Bruixa d'Or Manresa. However, an injury that kept him sidelined for most of the season would see him play only six games. In July 2015, Poeta returned to Italy, signing a one-year deal with Dolomiti Energia Trento. On 29 June 2016, Poeta signed with Auxilium Torino for the 2016–17 season. On February 18, 2018, Poeta went to win the 2018 edition of the Italian Basketball Cup with Fiat Torino by beating Germani Basket Brescia 69–67 in the Finals. On June 24, 2019, he has signed with Reggio Emilia of the Italian Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). However, at the end of the season Reggio Emilia and Poeta parted ways, and on August 5, 2020, he signed a 1+1 contract with Vanoli Cremona. International career After being called up for the first time in 2007, Poeta established himself in the Italian national team fold. He was part of the Italy squad for EuroBasket 2013 though he had a limited impact, with 4 points in less than 6 minutes on average. Poeta was called up to the preliminary Italy squad for EuroBasket 2015, but he did not make the final cut. Personal His first participation in basketball was as a scorekeeper for home town club Polisportiva Battipagliese where his father Franco was a press officer. He later played for the team at youth level.

His practice focuses on photography and photo-realistic paintings. Having been influenced by the psychoanalytical traditions of Freud and Jung, and scientific methods, Graff, regularly addresses in his work themes of identity, concealment, memory and a secular conception of the sacred. In-depth research led Graff to develop Alter Egos such as the scientist ‘Professore’ and the ethno-botanist Dr Albert Frique. His most extensive bodies of work are the ‘Black Box’ paintings, the ‘Constrictions’ photographic series, and the ‘Mille-Feuille’ paintings, which are made on numerous strips of wood, combining the disciplines of painting and sculpture. Graff has exhibited internationally. Selected exhibitions include: Galleria Mucciaccia, Rome (2018); Almine Rech Gallery, in London (2016); The Musée d’Art Modern et Contemporain in Nice, France (2013); the Ercel Foundation in Turin, Italy (2010); the Operating Room, Amerikan Hastanesi, Istanbul (2010); the Musee de Marrakech, Morocco (2004); and the Museum of Mankind in London (1991). Graff is the son of billionaire diamond tycoon Laurence Graff. Career and works =Early work= In the late 1980s, Graff utilised techniques combining painting, photography and photomontage. In a 1988 solo exhibition there were three categories of work: \\"Theological Studies\\", \\"Feminine Beauty\\", and \\"Screaming Portraits\\". Among the religious works was ‘The Last Supper’. In this photomontage, the heads of the disciples are concealed by black triangles, except for Judas, who is concealed by a black square. In ‘The Canonisation of Mary Magdalene’, the subject is veiled in black and depicted mourning Christ's crucifixion. According to De Dreyer, \\"By sculpting the halo in black, the artist narrates the transition from prostitute to saint.\\" In works exploring the theme of feminine beauty, Graff juxtaposed “traditional” and “radical” conceptions of the theme. His earlier treatment of the female nude, such ‘Twisted Nude’ (1988) was interpreted as referencing renaissance sculpture, and having “an inhuman, stone-like quality”. The \\"Screaming Portraits\\" series is characterised by tense, muscular detail and contorted expressions “suggestive of mental illness” It includes ‘Agree to Disagree’, ‘Portrait of the Old Man’ and ‘Exorcism’. =Earthworks= Much of Graff's early work was inspired by ancient and tribal art; he was often concerned with memory and man's relationship to the past. In February 1991, Graff exhibited the series ‘Earthworks’ at Crane Kalman Gallery, London. Works were made from earth, sand and oil paint, combined and applied to a wooden surface. Graff utilised a restricted palette of greys and earth tones, with the thick layers of \\"indigenous media\\" which he intended to be evocative of cave walls. The artist used the cave as a psychological metaphor, stating \\"I find that the creative process is like an excavation. The artist progressively digs deeper to unearth the fossils of the unconscious\\". Graff exhibited later works from the ‘Earthworks’ series at Fabien Fryns, Gallery, Spain, in 1997, alongside works from the ‘Mummification’ series. These ‘Earthworks’ were executed in similar organic, mixed media. ‘Traces de Terre’, ‘Akhenaten’s Dream’ and ‘Moonblood Dance’, referenced Paleolithic painting. \\". =Mummification series= From 1988, Graff carried out research on Ancient Egyptian artefacts, travelling to Cairo and Luxor. He also studied at the British Museum’s department of Egyptian Antiquities, where he was able to examine a large collection of Ancient Egyptian mummies and funeral relics Graff exhibited his ‘Mummification’ series at the New Burlington Gallery, London in 1994, sponsored by the Emerging Art Foundation. The exhibition also included a body of work titled ‘Sand Reliefs’. Works were informed by similar concerns to his 1992 photographic exhibition ‘Constrictions’ at Hamiltons Gallery, London, which included images of string bound meat and sculptural female forms bound with coarse rope. David Cohen reviewed the exhibition in ‘Contemporary Art’: \\"His new sculptural works explore similar borderline territory between the animate and the static, the sensual and the morbid.\\" Some sculptures interpreted the theme of mummification by incorporating personal objects, wrapped and preserved in numerous burnt linen packages and embedded in earth panels, which the artist viewed as resembling tribal burial grounds or rows of Egyptian Shabti figures. “The work relates to both what we can and what we cannot see before us; or more succinctly, it illustrates the theme of memory and repression.” (Graff) =Constrictions series= In 1991 Graff began producing a series of photographic nudes, entitled ‘Constrictions’ , and later revisited the series in 2013. The images present both male and female bodies as sites for constriction or concealment. They are usually bound with rope. \\"Following the Surrealists’ devotion to ethnography\\"(Pieroni), Graff was interested in forms of constriction evident in tribal or cultural practices, such as the neck extending rings of the Padaung people of South East Asia, and Chinese foot binding. His photograph ‘Rope Head’, with the male subject's head completely bound in rope, references artificial cranial deformation. Graff was also influenced by the escapist Houdini, prompting him to photograph a Mongolian contortionist and circus performers. Graff explained in an interview in Australian Magazine ‘Black +White’, 1995, \\"...that the figures are naked is very similar to Houdini’s performances – he would undress in front of his audience and be tied up. He had to prove there were no hidden tricks.\\" Graff stated that Man Ray’s ‘Venus Restaurée’ (1936) was a precursor to his series of ‘Constrictions’. He was also influenced by the exhibition ‘Le Corps en Morceaux’ at the Musée d’Orsay, Paris (1990). The critic Caroline Smith observed that Graff was among a number of photographers seeking to question the relationship between art and pornography. =Black Box series= The ‘Black Box’ series consists mainly of photorealistic, monochrome oil paintings. They often depict large groups of people or individuals and are derived from found photographs. The ‘Black Box’ motif painted over the eyes of the subjects has been associated with both \\"the structures of minimalist nihilism\\" and censorship in the press. Graff also intended to reference black paintings such as those by Malevich and Reinhart. The theme of concealment in Graff's work can be traced back to his earlier ‘Constirictions’, as well as his ‘Mummification’ series; a body of work for which, according to Pieroni, the British Museum’s collection of ancient mummies and funeral relics provided an opportunity for “reflecting on the complex relationship between concealment and the sacred”. Among Graff's more conceptual Black Box paintings are those of framed spaces. Within his painting of Freud’s office, is a framed mirror which Graff has filled with black paint. This mirror was used to treat agoraphobic patients and has been interpreted as a space where projected fears and desires frequently manifested. In the artwork Louvre 1 (Mona), a crowd of people are gathered around the Mona Lisa, which has been substituted by a black canvas. The image of this black canvas is repeated on the display screens of the crowds' digital cameras. Pieroni reads this photograph as expressing \\"Too many single-eyed viewers in front of a painting; too much looking, not enough vision\\". As of 2006, Graff's Black Box works were concentrated on the theme of the artist's studio; for example, Bacon Studio (Motion Blur) (2006), Studio Floor (2006), Reece Mews Still Life I (2006) and Brancusi Studio (Negative) 2006. =Professore= In 2008, Graff created a photographic body of work featuring his alter ego ‘Professore’ as a vehicle to question what he perceived as society's “innate trust in science”. The body of work is presented as an apparent archive. ‘Professore’ is a fictional scientist, who is often depicted performing complex and “absurd” experiments. Working primarily with photography, and also with painting, collage, sculpture, installation, sound and video, Graff created pseudo-scientific conditions within a fictive “laboratory”. Graff said in an interview \\"On the surface, [Professore] appears like a genius, but once scrutinised we can realise that his experiments are nonsensical and likely to end in complete failure!\\". Graff aimed to treat depictions of ‘Professore’ with a degree of humour, while presenting him as a character with a quest to expand human knowledge. In 2010 the ‘Professore’ exhibition took place in the American Hastenasi's Art Gallery's ‘Operation Room’; in the same year the series was shown at Assab 1, Milan, in the group exhibition ‘Wonderland’, curated by James Putnam . A review of a 2012 exhibition at Galerie Odile Ouizeman by Phillipe Dagen appeared in Le Monde, commenting on \\"allusions to Duchamp, Ernst, and also the cinema of the 1920s and 1960s performance art...\\". The series was also shown at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art (M.A.M.A.C), Nice in 2013, in the exhibition ‘La Quatrième Dimension’. According to Vaitsou, Graff's ‘Professore’ work is an exploration of identity, its construction, concealment, and breakdown. The body of work also intended to challenge the different ways that society perceives and reacts towards various groups of people. By adopting the role of the eccentric scientist, Graff intended to articulate similarities between artists and scientists in their working methods, for example empirical observation, controlled experimentation, research and trial and error. In his video work ‘Experiments in the Phenomena of Existence’ (2010), Graff, in the role of ‘Professore’, directed strangers he encountered in streets, or in Turkish coffee houses (kiraathane), often successfully choreographing “absurd” body articulations and movements, sometimes using pseudo-scientific instruments on members of the public.‘Professore’ is also seen apparently conducting scientific experiments with the use of his apparatus in the middle a café. Graff claimed \\"I was curious to see how the public would respond to this figure. ‘Professore's unconventional science can range from the fantastic to the banal, but he always treats his experiments with equal reverence so that they come across as plausible\\". While Graff's ‘Black Box’ work presented historic images of groups of artists,; in the ‘Professore’ series, he became interested in groups of scientists. Hence, there are images of ‘Professore’ montaged with images of Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud. The ‘Black Box’ series also featured paintings of empty studios, such as Bacon's and Brancusi’s. \\"With the ‘Professore’ work, this idea mutated into images of science laboratories, spaces for experimentation\\".

Mosher. Synopsis The book is a historical overview and criticism of the writings that shaped American perceptions of China. Mosher includes American newspaper correspondents, diplomats, and intellectuals such as Edgar Snow, Archibald Steele, Theodore White, and John K. Fairbank. The title plays with the title of Fairbank’s Book from 1974 ″China perceived″.Fairbank, John K., China perceived. Images and politics in Chinese-American relations, Alfred A. Knopf, New York (USA) 1974, As the first American anthropologist allowed into China following the inauguration of the 1979 cultural exchange program, Mosher's personal experience with the rural regions of Guangdong grant additional insight. Mosher's book covers the perceptions and misperceptions people have had about China from the travels of Marco Polo. Mosher takes the title \\"Age of Infatuation\\" from Harold Isaacs's classic Scratches on Our Minds (1958) to describe the period during the 1930s and 1940s in which Communist China was presented as a progressive force following Edgar Snow's 1938 work, Red Star Over China. The misperceptions of the West in regard to China have waxed and waned through the belief in the Yellow Peril to the model Maoist Man of Communist China. Mosher alleges self-deception was apparent in U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China and the change from hard-line anti-communist to raising toasts in Chairman Mao Zedong's name. Mosher argues that this was the most glaring example of how political expediency, ideology, and propaganda by the Chinese have constantly and consistently blinded Americans to the truth.

Family origins Malvern Hall - Seat of the English Griswold Family The Griswold family originates from Solihull, England, where they lived for centuries as greyhound breeders, which were a favorite of King Edward I of England. The first members of the family to arrive in America were the brothers Edward and Matthew Griswold, landing initially at Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1639 and continuing on as part of the group of colonists settling Windsor, Connecticut. In 1646, Matthew married Anna Wolcott and moved to Old Saybrook, Connecticut and was later Deputy and Commissioner of Lyme, Connecticut, quickly amassing thousands of acres of land and become one of the richest men in the colony. Edward Griswold remained in Windsor and played pivotal roles in the early politics of the colony. Many of his descendants moved west to New York following the American Revolution and founded the New York branch of the family, of whom Congressman John Augustus Griswold is descended from. Legacy and accumulation of wealth =Politics= Many members of the family were influential in state and national politics. During the colonial era, the Griswolds were one of a roughly half-dozen families which governed Connecticut state politics. In 1801, the Hartford Courant called \\"Griswold\\" one of the most \\"revered and ancient families\\" of Connecticut. =Industry= John Augustus Griswold of the New York branch of the family made a considerable fortune in the iron and steel industry, forming the Albany and Rensselaer Iron and Steel Works of Troy, New York. During the American Civil War, Griswold financed at his personal expense the USS Monitor and later engaged his iron business in the production of other Monitor class ironclad ships. Griswold later become president of the Troy and Lansingburgh Railroad, of the Troy and Cohoes Railroad and of the New Orleans, Mobile and Texas Railroad. Matthew Griswold VII, grandson of governor Roger Griswold, founded the Griswold Manufacturing Company of Erie, Pennsylvania, manufacturers of the Griswold cast-iron products. Samuel Griswold, a descendant of settler Edward Griswold, moved to Georgia and was notable for producing weapons for the Confederate Army. =China trade and shipping= N. L. and G. Griswold donated the service of George Griswold which left New York for Liverpool in January 1863 with a cargo for the relief of Lancashire working men. The cargo donated by the International Relief Committee and the New York Produce Exchange. The clipper ship \\"Challenge\\" of the N.L. & G. Griswold fleet Members of the Connecticut branch of the family moved to New York City in 1796 and engaged in trade. Brothers Nathaniel Lynde Griswold and George Griswold founded the N.L & G. Griswold Company to import sugar and rum from the Caribbean on clipper ships. They expanded to the China Trade, capturing a large share of the 19th century tea market. It was noted that \\"I do not suppose that there is a country store, however insignificant, in the entire United States that has not seen a large or small package of tea marked 'N.L & G.G.' George Griswold Jr operated clipper ships to China and amassed a great fortune; setting up residence on Fifth Avenue. John Griswold, brother of George Jr., was responsible for building the John N. A. Griswold House in Newport, Rhode Island. Another member of the family, John Griswold, founded the Black X Line of packet clippers that shipped supplies between the United States and Great Britain. Robert Harper Griswold, a man whom Herman Melville called \\"a man of much reading .. elegant manner and great personal beauty,\\" greatly expanded the line and amassed his own wealth. His wealth enabled him to buy what is now the home that now houses the Florence Griswold Museum, named after his daughter.

It was founded in 2007 by Cody Marx Bailey, Todd Huffman, Bill Erickson and others who volunteered to help with the idea. BIL started as an unaffiliated unconference satellite to TED’s structured ‘invite only’ paid conference. BIL is an open, self-organizing, emergent arts, science, society, and technology conference. Anyone can come, and anyone is able to sign-up to speak, limited only by space and time. The unconference structure allows for egalitarian treatment of anyone in any role; everyone is encouraged to participate where they can, whether that's clean up, set up, getting coffee, listening, AV work, blogging the conference, registration, etc.  Background  BIL’s mission statement: “BIL is an open, self-organizing, emergent, arts, science, society, and technology unconference.” There is no permanent staff or location, no one that organizes or speaks is paid, and even the acronym changes to reflect the will of the participants.  History  The name BIL was proposed as it was catchy, short, and unclaimed. It also humorously referenced the 1989 film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. The week of BIL 2008, the number of RSVPs had eclipsed the space limitations and the group was forced to announce that they were full. Subsequent BILs have been hosted in Long Beach, Vancouver, and San Francisco, timed with TED whenever they can. BIL went on to have conferences worldwide - Afghanistan, India, England, France, Canada and Tunisia, to name a few. There are also subject-focused variants such as BIL:PIL mirroring TEDMED, and JIL for women. After the first BIL, the TED organization contacted BIL leaders for advice on what later became their TEDx brand for individuals hosting their own versions of TED. They launched 3 months after the 2nd BIL. The core difference between TEDx and BIL is the amount of overhead and restrictions. TEDx requires that each applicant be thoroughly screened and already have conference experience; thus, TEDx is willing to exclude people.

This arrangement of scales can be either passive or active Three examples of multiscale turbulence generators. From left to right, a fractal cross grid, a fractal square grid and a fractal I grid. the manufacturing of a fractal grid. As turbulent flows contain eddies with a wide range of scales, exciting the turbulence at particular scales (or range of scales) allows one to fine-tune the properties of that flow. Multiscale turbulent flows have been successfully applied in different fields., such as: * Reducing acoustic noise from wings by modifying the geometry of spoilers;Nedić, J., B.

In 2013 the EU awarded a Marie Curie grant of 3.8M Euros for research and training of 13 young scientists and engineers in multiscale turbulence in order to further explore and apply the properties of these flows Multiscale turbulence has also played an important role into probing the internal structure of turbulence. This sort of turbulence allowed researchers to unveil a novel dissipation law in which the parameter C_\\\\epsilon in : \\\\varepsilon = C_\\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{U}^3}{\\\\mathcal{L}} is not constant, as required by the Richardson-Kolmogorov energy cascade. This new law can be expressed as C_\\\\epsilon \\\\propto \\\\frac{Re_I^m}{Re_L^n}, with m \\\\approx 1 \\\\approx n, where Re_I and Re_L are Reynolds numbers based, respectively, on initial/global conditions (such as free-stream velocity and the object's length scale) and local conditions (such as the rms velocity and integral length scale). This new dissipation law characterises non-equilibrium turbulence apparently universally in various flows (not just multiscale turbulence) and results from non-equilibrium unsteady energy cascade.

In August 2010, “Cho” ended the walk along the Amazon River that fellow adventurer Ed Stafford had started.Walking the Amazon completed, BBC News” In 2013 he achieved the world first kayak tour of Lake Titicaca. Biography Gadiel was born in 1978 in Pucallpa, Peru. He grew up in a rural settlement near the town of Satipo. He finished high school but his family could not afford to send him to university. Instead, he went to work on his father’s farm. He wanted to expand his family’s agriculture business, but times were tough economically. For that reason, he went to work for the Tala de Madera company of Satipo. Part of his job there included traveling to places where only indigenous people had been before. It was during his four years there that he realized how much he liked adventure. Gadiel was grateful for the opportunity to come to know the jungle, but unfortunately, that just didn’t pay the bills. In 2004, he was offered a job with an industrial logging outfit that used skidders to chop down the forests. He took that job, but he quit after experiencing many things that were unpleasant not only for him, but for the natural environment which he had come to admire so much. Later, in 2008, Gadiel met the English explorer Ed Stafford, who initially hired him as a guide. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Stafford took him as his assistant for the end of the journey. Gadiel was known in the media by his nickname Cho. He walked with Stafford for exactly two years. Expeditions * 2008 - 2010 - Walking the Amazon with Ed Stafford. Jungle guide and team member.

It is native to the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. This species was first described as Eolis neapolitana by the Italian naturalist Stefano delle Chiaje in 1841. However, although some authorities quote the year as 1823, the species does not appear in the first volume of delle Chiaje's memoirs, which was published that year. The species was later reassigned to the genus Spurilla. Distribution Spurilla neapolitana is found in shallow temperate waters in the Mediterranean Sea, the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Baja California. Molecular studies have shown that this is a species complex consisting of at least three species. The type Spurilla neapolitana is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from Cape Verde and the Azores to Portugal, and in the Mediterranean Sea. The western Atlantic population was denoted as Spurilla braziliana by MacFarland (1909) and the Pacific specimens may also be S. braziliana. Description Spurilla neapolitana is a large nudibranch, growing to a length of in the Mediterranean Sea. The rhinophores (the pair of sensory structures on the dorsal surface of the head) are lamellate. The cerata (outgrowths of the body) are also flattened and have opaque white tips. These tips are known as cnidosacs and are defensive structures armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells) garnered from sea anemones that the nudibranch has eaten. The general colour of this species is orange or pinkish, perhaps depending on what it has been eating, often with dark streaking where the tortuous digestive gland is visible through the translucent skin and the walls of the cerata. Some individuals have opaque patches of white on the body wall. Habitat Minimum recorded depth is 0 m. Maximum recorded depth is 3 m.Welch J. J. (2010). \\"The “Island Rule” and Deep-Sea Gastropods: Re-Examining the Evidence\\". PLoS ONE 5(1): e8776. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008776. Feeding habits Spurilla neapolitana feeds on sea anemones. The cnidocytes pass unharmed through the gut of the nudibranch to the tip of the cerata where they are stored, to be used in the animal's defence. The nudibranch's tissues harbour live intracellular zooxanthellae (photosynthetic single celled organisms), also derived from the sea anemone. It has been shown that the nudibranch's faeces contain live zooxanthellae, theoretically capable of reinfecting sea anemones, and this may be an important means by which the sea anemones acquire their zooxanthellae.

She currently lives in northern New Jersey. Education Deshpande attended high school in Massachusetts, and completed a BFA with honors in painting at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1997. In 1996 she studied at the Ingbretson Studio in Framingham and was instructed in the Boston School method by Meg Mercier. She was awarded the Ellen Battell Stoeckel Fellowship to attend the Yale Summer School of Music and Art in 1996. She continued her studies at the New York Academy of Art, earning her MFA in 1999. While attending NYAA, she studied under Vincent Desiderio and Steven Assael. She is an instructor at the Visual Arts Center of New Jersey and at the Teaching Studios of Art on Long Island. The Fall Exploring the Basement Assembling the Pieces Biography Deshpande is involved in promoting recognition of women in the arts. From 2016-2018 she chaired the New Media Relations committee of the Portrait Society of America's Cecilia Beaux Forum. Her articles about the importance of classical training in the arts have appeared in Artists on Art Magazine and on the Cecilia Beaux Forum blog. Her work has been included in several Women Painting Women gallery shows and in the Women Painting Women: In Earnest museum exhibition which traveled from the Clarksville-Montgomery County Museum in Tennessee to the J. Wayne Stark Galleries at Texas A&M; University. Deshpande has received recognition for her paintings by the Portrait Society of America, the Catharine Lorillard Wolfe Art Club, the Art Renewal Center, Allied Artists of America, and Oil Painters of America. Her work has appeared in publications including Poets and Artists Magazine, Fine Art Connoisseur, American Art Collector, The Artist's Magazine, Artists on Art, Artists Network, Southwest Art, and International Artist. Her paintings have been shown nationally in juried and invitational exhibitions in New York, New Jersey, Florida, South Carolina, and California. In 2019, her paintings were shown internationally at the MEAM in Barcelona, Spain as part of the Painting Today – International Women’s Day exhibition. Her work is included in the permanent collection of the New Britain Museum of American Art and the Cynthia Graham Hurd St. Andrews Library in Charleston, South Carolina. She is represented by Haynes Galleries in the United States and by Arundel Contemporary in West Sussex, England. Art Deshpande works in oil, painting figures, portraits, narratives, florals and still lifes. She often uses chiaroscuro to create a dramatic tone in her paintings. Her work is inspired by John Singer Sargent, and deals with personal allegorical themes.Her depiction of female characters is realistic and focuses more on an internal dialog than on the external beauty of her subjects. Her themes often include playing cards, games, electricity, light/shadows, dolls, children, religion, and the dynamics between people. In The Fall (2013), Deshpande explores darker themes inspired by life and dreams. Using a predominantly warm palette and closely related values in The Fall was a choice Deshpande made to \\"up\\" the thematic intensity but also to establish the figure as having an equal part in the narrative as the child's toys. The young girl in the painting is Deshpande's daughter. It is an intimate scene Deshpande imagined one day in the car, but it is also slightly sinister, made all the more so by Deshpande's other inspiration for the painting—a nightmare in which she witnessed a child falling to the ground (that child is represented by Raggedy Andy). In 2016, Deshpande was one of the nine artists, including Mario Robinson, Judy Takács, Laur Tilden, and Terry Strickland, who participated in the Emanuel Nine Portrait Project at Principle Gallery, honoring the victims of the Charleston church shooting.

Kahlenberg Ed., A Notion at Risk: Preserving Public Education as an Engine for Social Mobility pp. 9-30. New York: Century Foundation Press.

Summer learning and its implications: Insights from the Beginning School Study. In R. Fairchild, & G. Noam Eds., “Summertime : Confronting Risks, Exploring Solutions” pp. 33-43. San Francisco : Jossey-Bass/Wiley Research has shown that approximately two-thirds of the ninth-grade achievement gap between lower and higher income youth can be partly explained by earlier summer learning loss. Students from low-income areas lose between 2.5 and 3.5 months of academic learning each summer, and teachers spend four to six weeks of the new school year reviewing old material.\\"Practice Makes Perfect\\" attempts to address this \\"learning lag\\" through a summer education program in socio- economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. History After reading McKinsey’s 2009 report “The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America’s Schools\\", Karim Abouelnaga brought together five fellow Cornell students Andre Perez, Zach West, Amy Mitchell, Brennan Spreitzer, and Nicolas Savvides in 2010 to start PMP, as a student organization.Hovis, Kathy. \\"To give back, students launch nonprofit mentoring organization\\", Cornell Chronicle, December 7, 2011 In its first year, supported by Entrepreneurship@Cornell, the Cornell Public Service Center and various individuals, PMP launched its pilot program in Long Island City, Queens. Nicolas Savvides served as program administrator for Practice Makes Perfect. As financing difficulties arose, the program operating expenses were slashed substantially and the founders ran a pilot program on almost one-fifth of the original estimated cost. Since then, the organization has operated programs in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. Over the last four years, PMP has served over 550 students and indirectly impacted thousands more through its community service efforts. PMP strives to ameliorate the summer learning loss.

Every site has a minimum of two classrooms, each consisting of 20 scholars/students, 5 mentors, 1 teaching fellow and a joint teaching coach. *Students grades K – 8 in need of academic support and remediation are paired in cohorts of four and assigned a mentor for the duration of summer. *Mentors are students that have completed grades 4 – 12 and have achieved proficiency. Mentors receive a small financial stipend. Additionally, they receive test prep support in SHSAT, PSAT, and SAT in conjunction with high school and college readiness. *Teaching Fellows are students that recently completed their junior, senior year in college or are attending graduate school. They are provided with professional development and training prior to their placement. *Teaching Coaches are certified NYC Department of Education teachers and are given responsibility for two classes over the summer. They conduct evaluations using the Danielson Framework. Methodology & Operations PMP programs operates in school buildings. Students receive instruction in math, English, and writing, in addition to enrichment activities like music, dance, and drama. Breakfast and lunch are served through the NYC School Food program; however, students can bring in their own meals. Participants engage in a local community service project to help rebuild their neighborhoods, such as cleaning up parks or organizing food drives. Throughout the summer, scholars partake in a spelling bee, math bee, and world day. Scholars go on trips to museums, art exhibitions, zoos, gardens, and corporate offices. At the conclusion of the summer, the principal is provided with a progress report that highlights aggregate progress and each additional students’ strengths and areas that need improvement. Outcomes & Evaluation In 2015, PMP will begin a two-year independent evaluation that is being conducted by Philliber Research Associates to determine the impact of the program. Media USA Today said that “Abouelnaga’s non-profit, Practice Makes Perfect, which he started with five other Cornell University students in 2011, has emerged as a potential answer to the problems that plague summer schooling nationwide.” The New York Times said “Perhaps PMP will grow up to become one piece of a solution — a way to give a larger section of low-income children the kind of summer enrichment middle class students take for granted.” Supporters On December 2013, PMP was awarded $100,000 by the Pershing Square Foundation \\"...to grow to support 1,000 students this summer, adding three new staff members and improving their curriculum and programming.\\"Fayne, James. \\"'Practice Makes Perfect' Awarded $100,000 From the Peshing Square Foundation\\", Pershing Square Foundation PMP has received support from Ernst & Young, Ann & Andrew Tisch, Alan Hassenfeld, Stanley O’Neal, Echoing Green, The Heckscher Foundation for Children, The A.L.

Location The church stands on eastern side of Gdańska street, at N°56. History Predecessors of the Sisters of the Poor Clares in Bydgoszcz were the sisters of the Order of Poor Clares. They came to Bydgoszcz in 1615 and stayed until secularization of the Order by Prussian authorities in 1835. This congregation left several monastic buildings in the urban landscape of Bydgoszcz, still visible today: * the hospital and shelter edifice, now operated by the Regional Museum department; * the Gothic and renaissance Poor Clares' Church. The sisters of the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration came to Bydgoszcz in 1925: it was not the congregation from the 17th to 19th centuries, but its younger branch, whose mission is a constant adoration of Jesus Christ through Blessed Sacrament of Eucharist. The present building of the chapel was built in 1900-1901, designed as a residential villa belonging to Adolf and Emil Kolwitz. The Kolwitzs' were a notable Prussian merchant who had had a charitable foundation that helped supporting Diakonisek Hospital in Poznań. In Bydgoszcz, Adolf and Emil co-owned a warehouse, Ludwig Kolwitz, in Chodkiewicza street. In 1925, the plot was sold to the congregation of the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration from Gniezno and construction started on the spot. The dedication of the chapel happened on September 14, 1925, during a ceremony chaired by Bishop Antoni Laubitz. Then started the perpetual Eucharistic adoration. The day-long adoration students attended school in Bydgoszcz and were residents of the city. On September 13, 1939, Nazi troops entered the monastery, arrested the chaplain and locked the chapel. On July 7, 1941, the sisters were forced to leave the monastery, while Nazis had offices built in the premises. One of the sisters, Maria Kaminska Kaleta, was murdered in 1944. After the liberation of Bydgoszcz, the chapel billeted Soviet troops from January to June 1945, then the building was initially allocated to the Tax Chamber office of Pomerania. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of the sisters, they regained back their building from July 22, 1945. The reorganization of the monastery after World War II ended on February 16, 1946, when lifetime adoration resumed inside the edifice. On September 29, 1986, Cardinal Józef Glemp has consecrated the new altar in the chapel. The current public chapel is located in a former villa. Architecture The initial building was built in the style of the early modernism with elements of neo-classicism. In 1925, during the reconstruction, the interior has been decorated to fit chapel's requirements, and the facade has been adorned with a small cross and a bell. On November 22, 1953, has been unveiled the sacrated image ofOur Lady of Perpetual Help by Father Kazimierz Hołda.

His platoon, in No. 4 Company, was part of the defensive force from the 4th (Guards) Brigade covering the retirement of the 2nd Infantry Division on the retreat from Mons. His platoon and a second platoon did not receive the order to retire and were cut off. Lieutenants Manners and George Edward Cecil and around 160 guardsmen were killed. His body was never located. A letter from Rudyard Kipling to Lady Edward Cecil records a conversation at Gatcombe House in December 1914 with the convalescent Private Walter Titcombe, who had served in Manners' platoon and claimed that Manners was shot through the head and died instantly. Memorial to Lieutenant J. Manners, Clovelly, Devon Manners is commemorated at the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre memorial on the south bank of the River Marne in France. A bronze effigy of Manners by Sir Bertram Mackennal is at All Saints Chapel, Thorney Hill, with lettering for the memorial cut by Eric Gill. The baroque chapel had been built in 1906 to a design by Detmar Blow to commemorate the death of Manners' sister Christine. Manners is also commemorated at Mount Pleasant, Clovelly, on land that was donated to the National Trust by his aunt Christine Hamlyn. As the first son of a peer, his name is recorded on the wooden panels of the war memorial in the Royal Gallery at the House of Lords. Family Manners was the fourth child and eldest son of John Thomas Manners-Sutton, 3rd Baron Manners. His father was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and served as a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards between 1857 and 1883, and later as a captain in 3rd Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment. His father was married at Clovelly on 12 August 1885, to Constance Edwina Adeline Hamlyn- Fane; she was the daughter of Henry Edward Hamlyn-Fane and Susan Hester Hamlyn-William. Their family home was at Avon Tyrrell in the New Forest in Hampshire. It is not clear when the family dropped the Sutton surname. Manners had three elder sisters, Mary Christine (1886-1904), and twins Angela Margaret (1889- 1970) and Betty Constance (1889-1962). His eldest sister Christine died aged 17 in Bangalore; the others married (respectively) Arthur Melland Asquith, son of H. H. Asquith, and Christian Malise Hore-Ruthven, son of Walter James Hore-Ruthven, 9th Lord Ruthven of Freeland. His younger brother Francis Henry (1897-1972) was also educated at Eton, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge. Francis also served in the Grenadier Guards in the First World War. He survived, winning the Military Cross, and succeeded their father as 4th Baron Manners, later serving as lieutenant colonel of the 5th/7th Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment and becoming a Deputy Lieutenant in 1939.

Filmmakers associated with the Film Group include Mike Gray, William Cottle, Howard Alk, Mike Shea, and Chuck Olin. The majority of their films reside at Chicago Film Archives within The Film Group Collection and Chuck Olin Collection. Over its approximately ten-year existence from 1964-1973 the company went through a variety of name, location, and personnel changes. Mike Gray and Lars Hedman created Hedman Gray Inc. in 1964 and were located at Hedman's photography studio on 3325 West Huron in Chicago, Illinois. In early 1966 they added photographer Mike Shea. They changed the name of the company to Hedman Gray Shea Inc. and opened an 11,000 square foot state of the art production facility at 430 West Grant Place and soon after changed their name to the Film Group. At that point Hedman was the president, Shea was the director of photography, and Gray was the writer/producer. Right after the move to Grant Place they hired James Dennett as a production manager, William Cottle as the business manager and financial backer, and Chuck Olin as salesman. Hedman left the company by the end of 1966 and Shea left in 1967. Gray then took over as cameraman. Cottle left in 1969 and the company changed its name to Mike Gray Associates and moved to 120 West Kinzie. The company was dissolved in 1973 with Gray's move to California. From 1965 to 1972 they made TV commercials for national and local clients including Eli Lilly and Company, Montclair cigarettes, Hills Bros Coffees, Mogen David, Sara Lee, WBIB TV, Aunt Jemima, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Illinois Bell, Quaker Oats, Chicago Tribune, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Sears. They also made longer sponsored films for clients that are closer to their documentary work including A Matter of Opportunity (1970) and 8 Flags for 99 Cents (1970).> Their documentary films include the two features- American Revolution II (1969) and The Murder of Fred Hampton (1971). The two films are closely related and document the unrest of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, follow the Chicago chapter of the Black Panthers, and refute the city of Chicago's media cover up of Fred Hampton’s death. In 1969 they released a seven part educational film series Urban Crisis and the New Militants in an attempt to update the educational film genre. This series includes the 1966 film Cicero March, which was added to the National Film Registry in 2013.

The dissident group was given support of the owner of the manor, countess Eva Margareta Stenbock. The movement excluded themselves from the church and practiced a form of socialism. In 1738, they were subjected to an investigation on behalf of the church, and the name of the incident refers to the passion play in which the female preacher Dordi Olofsdotter acted in the part of Christ. The movement was suppressed after Eva Margareta Stenbock subjected to reuniting with the church in 1741. Movement The origin of the incident at Stora Bjurum was a movement founded in Vänersborg by a priest by the name of Lenberg some years before. The movement disliked the church and focused on a personal, internal religious service and interpretation of the bible. This teleology reached the parish of Bjurum with to female preachers from Främmestad: Kerstin Andersdotter and Dordi Olofsdotter. The Stora Bjurum was at the time owned by major count Erik Fredrik Stenbock (1686-1739), though the actual manager of the estate was his spouse, Eva Margareta Clerck (d. 1743). Eva Margareta Clerck became a follower of the movement, and gave its congregation refuge at the estate, which made Stora Bjurum the center of the cult. Among the members of the movement who came to Bjurum because of this were the dissident priests Nils Nabbelius and Sven Hulthén, the last of whom also opened a school there. Eva Margareta Clerck also encouraged the population in the surrounding countryside to join the movement with all sorts of privileges. Investigation These activities were in fact illegal according to the then exciting law, konventikelplakatet, which banned private sermons. On 28 February 1738, Stora Bjurum was investigated by the authorities and a delegation from the consistory led by the vicar Sven Holmvall, who filed a report to the authorities. According to the report, the members of the congregation lived in Stora Bjurum manor house. Many of them was reportedly sick and bedridden upon his arrival, but while he was there, the sick were miraculously cured by the dissident vicar Nils Nabbelius. Some of the sick reacted by convulsions, Religious ecstasy and condemnations of the clergy. It was pointed out, that siblings of opposite gender shared beds, and implied that the members of the congratulation participated in extramarital sex. Some of the members had vandalized the local church in Mårby, and one of them, Alita Sundberg, a female relative and ladies companion of the countess, had performed a sexual act by the church altar. Holmvall also witnessed a Passion Play, were a female, the female preacher Dordi Olofsdotter, acted in the part of Jesus Christ. The end of the Passionsspelen på Stora Bjurum By the report, Stora Bjurum were classified as a place of dissident activity against the church. Countess Stenbock, Eva Margareta Clerck, were scandalized and banned from church. Upon the death of her spouse in 1739, she had him buried in Skara cathedral outside of the ceremonies of the church. The authorities finally acted, however. The leading members of the movement, among them the preachers Kerstin Andersdotter and Dordi Olofsdotter, and the dissident priest Nils Nabbelius, were exiled from the parish - Nabbelius evidently married Kerstin. By Christmans 1740, most of the members had returned to the church: on 22 September, Eva Margareta Clerck herself also declared before the authorities that she herself was reunited with the church. In reality, however, she had been converted to the Moravian Church by one of its main missionaries in Sweden, Elias Östergren. She benefited the Moravian movement in Sweden until her death, and are regarded as one of three most notable converts which contributed to the rapid spread of the Moravian Church in Sweden in the mid 18th-century.

The ship De Jonge Thomas broke anchor in a gale force Northwestern and was driven ashore in the Salt River Mouth.

Hsu turned away from traditional calligraphy because he felt it was too steeped in conservatism to be relevant to contemporary Chinese society.

A long serving justice of the peace, he was elected to the Arizona Territorial Legislature and appointed to a four-year term as Secretary of Arizona Territory. Biography Nichols was born to William Nathaniel and Emily Louise (Haywood) Nichols on October 8, 1852 in Sterling, Massachusetts. The family moved to Michigan Bar, California in 1855. From there, they went to Sacramento before settling in Oakland. Nichols was educated in Oakland's public schools. Upon completing his formal education, Nichols went to work for his father and brother in the family's woodenware business. After moving to Arizona Territory in 1880, Nichols lived in Tombstone and Charleston for about a year before settling in Willcox. There he went to work for the L. W. Blinn Lumber Company. Initially living in the company's Willcox office, Nichols purchased the company in 1888. In addition to lumber, Nichols developed interests in real estate and cattle ranching. Socially, Nichols was a Mason who achieved the 32nd degree. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen. Nichols married Nora Minerva (Seeley) Butterfield on July 18, 1898. Becoming active in county level Republican politics shortly after his arrival in Arizona, Nichols became a justice of the peace by 1883. He held this position for eighteen years.He also served as a United States Courts commissioner for several years. Nichols was elected to represent Cochise County in the 13th Arizona Territorial Legislature. In April 1898, he became a member of the Live Stock Sanitary Board. Governor N. O. Murphy appointed Nichols Territorial Auditor in October 1901 and he took the oath of office on November 1. Governor Alexander Oswald Brodie nominated him for a second term as auditor on January 28, 1903. In early 1904, Governor Brodie recommended Nichols for the position of Territorial Secretary. President Theodore Roosevelt made the nomination on March 30, 1904. As secretary, Nichols became a leader in the fight against Arizona and New Mexico receiving joint statehood. Beyond that he is credited for the satisfactory performance of his duties and was widely respected. Unlike most of Arizona's secretaries, Nichols did not seek advancement to the position of governor. When Governor Brodie recommended Nichols to become his successor in 1908, Nichols declined to take the position. Nichols' given reason was that the territory would soon face a political battle over how mines were taxed and he was poorly suited to lead the fight. He also declined a second term as secretary and instead left office at the end of his term on April 1, 1908. Nichols and his wife moved to Los Angeles, California shortly after he left office. There she died on May 13, 1911. In 1914, Nichols' house burned down and he moved into his club instead of rebuilding. Nichols died in Los Angeles on November 15, 1917. He was cremated and his remains interred at Los Angeles' Rosedale Cemetery.

A description after the ship had been seized and restored in 1919 noted she was among the fastest and best equipped ships of the line with accommodations for 115 first class passengers and 1,572 third and steerage class passengers as well as a crew of 179 officers and men.This account was after the ship had been refurbished and perhaps modified in Panama after seizure. During World War I Sierra Cordoba supplied German raiders, particularly while hiding in the Straits of Magellan. After that ship and Sierra Cordoba moved northward in the Pacific, where the cruiser met British forces, the German liner interned herself in Callao, Peru, named Callao and later transferred to the United States Shipping Board, refurbished by Panama Canal personnel and briefly placed in commission with the United States Navy as USS Callao (ID-4036) to bring service people home from Europe. The ship was sold, renamed Ruth Alexander in 1923 and put into coastwise passenger and cargo service between Puget Sound and Mexico, typically calling at Seattle, Victoria, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and (by 1931) Ensenada, Mexico, until finally converted to a cargo ship in 1939. On 9 December 1941 Ruth Alexander arrived in Manila the day after Manila had learned of the coming of war to the Pacific (8 December Manila time). The ship survived bombing raids in Manila harbor before attempting to escape on 28 December, as United States forces were retreating into Bataan, and being bombed and abandoned on 31 December. One crew member was lost, four wounded, and all survivors were picked up by a Dutch Dornier 24 bomber. The ship finally sank on 2 January. World War I =Supplying German raiders= During World War I Sierra Cordoba supplied German raiders in the South Atlantic and Pacific. On 23 November 1914 Sierra Cordoba had arrived in Montevideo with captured crews from the liner La Correntina and the French barque Union sunk by . The presence of German merchant vessels and the types of cargoes being loaded in neutral South American ports was taken as indication of German naval activity with Sierra Cordoba being loaded with coal at Montevideo on 22 November 1914 seen as significant. Dresden, after escaping at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December, was sheltering in the waters south of the Straits of Magellan with British forces under Rear Admiral Archibald Stoddart actively searching for her location. Sierra Cordoba was then known to be a raider supply ship and had cleared Montevideo, supposedly for Callao, Peru on 18 December with supplies of coal and water. On 26 December in \\"Snug Bay\\"This appears to be an old term for a location that shows up rarely in searches. There is a recognized geographic name of Bahía Snug located at: 53° 50' 49\\" S, 071° 26' 48\\" W Admiral Stoddart found Sierra Cordoba but could take no action beyond briefly boarding due to the fact a Chilean destroyer was observing his movements and it was presumed Chileans were observing the merchant vessel for neutrality violations. Sierra Cordoba joined Dresden and continued to supply the cruiser until 14 February 1915 when Dresden put to sea. Both ships moved northward off the coast of Chile, with the cruiser coaling several times, until Sierra Cordoba was dismissed after spending three days coaling the raider before heading into Valparaiso for coal. Sierra Cordoba departed Valparaiso on 7 March, coaled Dresden at Juan Fernández Islands 9 March, and eventually put into Callao as the cruiser had been sunk five days after the meeting. =Seizure and United States service= The ship was detained by Peru 17 March 1917 and renamed Callao. The Peruvian government turned Callao over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB) whereupon she was towed from Lima by the dredge Culebra to Balboa, Panama in October 1918 to be the first of five seized German vessels to be repaired by the Panama Canal Company's Mechanical Division correcting damage from long internment and sabotage done by their German crews. Sabotage included firing the boilers at full capacity without water in an effort to destroy them, prevented only by the superheating tubes, but still causing extensive damage, and damage to the engines. Repairs, including a completely new electrical system, were completed with the ship ready for sea on 5 April 1919. Callao transited the canal, loaded cargo at Cristobal and cleared for New York on 8 April. The USSB transferred Callao to U.S. Navy to be commissioned USS Callao (ID-4036) 26 April 1919, making two round trips to France to return personnel, whereupon she decommissioned 20 September 1919 at Norfolk, Virginia. Callao, then located at New York, was offered for sale at auction 7 November 1921 by USSB. Commercial service The ship was purchased by Dollar Steamship Lines, chartered to the Admiral Line (Pacific Steamship Company) for coastal passenger service and renamed by the line's owner, H.F. Alexander, Ruth Alexander in 1923. The ship frequented the ports of Seattle, Victoria, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego during this service and by 1931 had added Ensenada, Mexico. The U.S. Maritime Commission took over Dollar Line in 1939 and the ship was then converted to a cargo ship by American President Lines. According to one source the ship's registry was then changed to Panama. Lloyd's shows no registry change into 1941–1942 publication dates.Other sources, particularly those dealing with the ship's loss make no mention of \\"Panamanian\\" and others, such as USMM \\"U. S. Flag Ships including U.S. Maritime Commission ships\\" lost lists, indicate the ship was U.S. flag at that time.) =World War II and loss= On 9 December 1941 Ruth Alexander arrived in Manila from San Francisco to learn of the war coming to the Pacific. The ship survived three weeks of bombing in the harbor before attempting to escape on 28 December to Australia or any safe port. Manila had been declared an open city on 26 December, yet had been subject to massive air attacks and multiple waves of Japanese naval aircraft directed against the port and shipping on 27 December that continued on 28 December. The government and military, except for rear echelons of Army headquarters, had already evacuated to Bataan and Corregidor. Captain F. P. Willarts left under cover of darkness short seventeen men, all to become prisoners of war of which three died (two aboard the Japanese prisoner transport Arisan Maru), who were left ashore in the hurried escape. The ship was heading toward Borneo in the Dutch East Indies, an area already under attack and partially occupied by Japanese forces. During the transit from Manila to Balikpapan the ship was bombed and damaged by a Japanese flying boat in Makassar Strait on 31 December 1941, finally sinking on 2 January. =Crew rescue= Forty-eight survivors were rescued by a Dutch Dornier 24 on the day of the attack. A later account noted the Dutch bomber pilot had landed intent on a mass rescue and had dumped his bomb load, taken on survivors in three rafts to find the fourth, landed again picking up the occupants and taken off with fifty-five persons aboard including the seven bomber crew members. Survivors were landed at Tarakan where they remained a day before being flown to Balikpapan where another day was spent before being evacuated by ship to Surabaya arriving 4 January 1942. All crew but one still in hospital, who was taken prisoner of war and released September 1945, were evacuated by steamer about 24 January before the Japanese took Java in March. A Navy press release, number 26 of 9 January 1942, noted the ship had been abandoned and declared a total loss with one crew member killed and four injured.

Early life Hillyard was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, the son of Commander George Whiteside Hillyard and Blanche Bingley. His father won an Olympic gold medal for tennis in 1908, and his mother won the women's championship at Wimbledon six times between 1886 and 1900. His younger sister Marjorie was born in 1896, in the Hillyard's house \\"The Elms\\" in Thorpe Satchville, Leicestershire. He attended Harrow School, and played in the Eton v Harrow cricket match twice. In 1909, he took 3 wickets; the following year, in the famous match that became known as \\"Fowler's match\\", he was Harrow's top scorer, reaching 62 runs in the first innings, and took 5 wickets, but against the odds Harrow lost to Eton. Hillyard served in the Royal Field Artillery in the First World War, spending four years in France and reaching the rank of major. His father served in the Royal Navy. Tennis career He played in the men's singles at Wimbledon from 1920 to 1930, and 1932 and 1934, reaching the third round in 1920, 1922 and 1923. He lost the final of the All England Plate in 1924 to Jack Condon, but won the Surrey Grass Court Championships that year. He also won the Romsey Open in 1920, beating B.V Harcourt in the final. Hillyard achieved greater success in the doubles, where he was Riviera double champion with Erik Worm, and won the Monte Carlo Second Meeting in April 1921. He reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in both men's doubles and the mixed doubles in 1921, playing with Algernon Kingscote and Phyllis Satterthwaite respectively. He repeated the feat in 1923, playing with Gerald Sherwell and Satterthwaite again. Later life Hillyard married writer Fabienne d'Avilla in 1945. She was the daughter of French author Léon Brethous-Lafargue and divorced wife of Pedro Frederico Vaz de Carvalhaes. She wrote under the names Francis D'Avilla and Evelyn Fabyan. She did not remarry after they were divorced, and died in 1980. In 1952, he married Mary Penelope Colthurst, daughter of Sir Richard St John Jefferyes Colthurst, 8th Baronet. She had divorced first husband, Brigadier Godfrey John Hamilton, in 1942. She inherited Blarney Castle, and she died 1975. Hillyard died at Blarney Castle, in County Cork, Ireland. He had no children.

Founded in 1959 as a small, volunteer-based environmental advocacy group, NRCM has grown to be Maine's largest environmental advocacy organization, with more than 25,000 supporters and activists and a staff of 30, including science and policy experts. About The Natural Resources Council of Maine was formed on June 25, 1959 when a coalition of environmental organizations from across Maine came together to address emerging threats to Maine's land, air, and water. NRCM's work through the 1960s and 1970s on a range of environmental and conservation issues positioned the organization as a leader in Maine's growing conservation movement. The organization's mission statement is: > \\"To protect, restore, and conserve Maine's environment, now and for future > generations\\" It further states that it \\"harnesses the power of the law, science, and the voices of more than 25,000 supporters statewide and beyond ... to protect the health of Maine’s rivers, lakes, streams, and coastal waters; promote sustainable communities through initiatives that reduce toxics pollution and waste; decrease air and climate-changing pollution through energy efficiency and renewable sources; conserve Maine lands and wildlife habitat, including our treasured North Woods; and defend the federal environmental policies and programs that help protect Maine\\". In addition to working on a number of different specific program areas, NRCM monitors the legislative and executive agency rulemaking process at the state government level. Historically the Natural Resources Council of Maine has partnered with citizens and other non- profit organizations from across Maine to promote issues of mutual concern. Programs The Natural Resources Council of Maine focuses on several different program areas: *The Climate and Clean Energy program works on issues promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, reducing climate pollution, ensuring the enforcement of the Clean Air Act, and clean transportation alternatives. *The Healthy Waters program works across the state to prevent contamination of Maine's thousands of lakes, ponds, and streams; to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act, to remove obsolete dams as part of river restoration efforts, and to ensure water is safe for wildlife, for recreation, and for human consumption. *The Forests and Wildlife program works to conserve the many undeveloped areas of the state by advocating limiting urban sprawl, balanced development, public lands, and sustainable forest management. *The Sustainable Maine program works to promote more sustainable waste management programs, especially recycling initiatives, through outreach to individuals, communities, and state government. The program also works to decrease toxic waste and the use of toxic products in consumer products. *The Federal Project monitors and advocates for policies at the national level that could affect Maine’s environmental interests, keeping abreast of the activities of the state’s Congressional delegation and the Executive branch of Federal government of the United States. *NRCM Rising is an outreach program created by and for the next generation, specifically individuals in their twenties, thirties, and forties, for the protection of the environment. The program began in 2014. *NRCM's State House Watch program actively tracks the Maine State Legislature. NRCM staff regularly submits comments to both legislative committees and executive agencies promoting the organization's interests. Legislative activism is a central aspect of NRCM's operation and mission. Significant issues NRCM has been involved with most of Maine's most important environmental issues. \\\\---- 1960s Allagash Waterway, Autumn. *The major issue that led to the formation of the Natural Resource Council of Maine in 1959 was the increasing risk of deterioration of the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. This almost 100 mile long stretch of streams, lakes, and rivers located in far northern Maine was facing threats from a variety of sources. Encroachment of roadways, poor timber harvesting practices, and several proposed hydropower projects threatened to irreparably change the wilderness character of the Allagash. NRCM worked in concert with established national conservation organizations to promote the value of the Allagash as a designated conservation area. In 1966 the citizens of Maine passed a referendum authorizing the state to issue a $1.5 million bond to purchase the waterway and permanently protect its wilderness character. In 1970, the waterway became part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 1970s Deposit notice on a bottle sold in the continental U.S. indicating the container's deposit value in various states *NRCM was a key supporter of the so-called \\"Bottle Bill\\" legislation approved by Maine voters in November 1976. Angus King, then in private practice as an attorney in Brunswick, Maine, acted as NRCM's primary lobbyist on the issue at the Maine Legislature. The bill, which required beverage manufacturers to charge a bottle redemption fee on bottles and cans, is arguably Maine's oldest and most successful recycling promotion law. The legislation has come under fire numerous times since its adoption, but NRCM and other product stewardship organizations have worked successfully to preserve it against attempts at repeal several times over the last 40 years. *In 1977, Governor James B. Longley signed a bill that banned and removed billboards across the state, making Maine the second state in the US to prohibit off-premises billboards. NRCM helped to rally support for this original law and has led opposition against later attempts to weaken it. 1980s *Working with several other conservation groups within the state, NRCM opposed and eventually prevented the Great Northern Paper Company's proposed Big A dam project on the West Branch of the Penobscot River. The proposed dam would have created a lake several miles in length, and flooded out some of the most important stretches of wild water in the Northeast United States. Specifically, the dam would have submerged the Ripogenus Gorge; a deep gorge along the West Branch of the Penobscot River that had the potential to be designated a Natural National Landmark. Further, the dam had the potential to disrupt some of the most pristine existing habitats for landlocked salmon spawning. *In 1987 NRCM was one of the primary supporters of both the legislation and the public referendum that led to the formation of the Land for Maine's Future program. In response to growing concerns about unchecked development, urban sprawl, real-estate speculation, and the potential for the loss of lands significant to Maine's cultural heritage, the citizens of Maine voted to approve a $35 million bond package intended to finance the state purchase of lands of statewide importance. Breaching of the Edwards Dam. July 1, 1999; Augusta, ME 1990s *Breaching of the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River When the Edwards Dam's license came up for review in the late 1980s, a coalition of Maine-based conservation groups, led by the Natural Resources Council of Maine, lobbied before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the dam's decertification and deconstruction. They argued that the economic and ecological value of restoring the river to a more natural state, which included the return of sea-run species of fish, far outweighed the benefit of hydroelectric energy production at the site. After a long period of debate and consideration, the FERC ultimately agreed with conservation groups and issued a landmark ruling calling for the removal of dam. The dam was removed on July 1, 1999. The breaching of the Edwards Dam established a useful precedent that was later used to decommission and breach other obsolete dams in other places in the state. 2000s *In 2004, NRCM successfully lobbied for passage of the nation's first state-level e-waste recycling law. Under the law, certain categories of e-waste are banned from landfills, costs to consumers are reduced for disposal at designated transfer stations, and companies are billed for the cost of recycling the materials at the end of their life. Since Maine's passage of this landmark law, 24 other states have passed legislation requiring statewide e-waste recycling. *In 2005, Plum Creek, a real-estate development company based in Washington state, submitted the largest development proposal in state history. The proposed development would have built two resorts, hundreds of residential units, a marina, a golf course, and other facilities on the southern shores of Maine's Moosehead Lake. NRCM was the first organization to oppose the plan on the grounds that it was too much development in an inappropriate area. Working with stakeholders across the state, NRCM forced a number of concessions from the developers, and, although the proposal was eventually allowed to move forward, NRCM continued to act as a watchdog to ensure the plan and process were subject to public scrutiny and responsive to public input 2010s *In collaboration with the Penobscot Nation, American Rivers, the Atlantic Salmon Federation, Maine Audubon, The Nature Conservancy, and Trout Unlimited, NRCM formed the Penobscot River Restoration Project⁠—a coalition organized to rejuvenate the Penobscot River and reconnect the Gulf of Maine to inland waters. After more than a decade of work and fundraising efforts, the coalition successfully purchased and removed the Great Works and Veazie Dams, and built a natural fish bypass around the Howland Dam, restoring passage for native sea-run fish and reviving wildlife populations that depend on them for survival. *NRCM was one of the leading proponents of the 87,500-acre Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument established by President Obama on Aug. 24, 2016. The National Monument is located in northern Maine, east of Baxter State Park. Although some residents in the region initially opposed the proposal,[15] on the grounds that it would interfere with the traditional forest products industries in the area, the eventual closure of paper mills in the towns of Millinocket and East Millinocket and the recognition by local residents and businesses, including the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, that the National Monument would help diversify their local economy led many to support the National Monument. *NRCM played a significant role in the effort to get South Portland, Maine to pass an ordinance banning the shipment of oil from Canadian tar sands through existing pipeline infrastructure located in that city. *NRCM was the lead opponent of an effort to weaken mining regulations in response to an open-pit mining proposal on Bald Mountain in northern Maine. After a six-year endeavor, the Maine Legislature overrode a veto from former Governor Paul LePage and passed the strictest mining regulations in the nation. *In 2019, Maine became the first state in the US to enact a ban on polystyrene (Styrofoam) food containers and the third state to prohibit single-use plastic shopping bags at checkout. NRCM had been providing support to local activists to pass such bans at the municipal level for years and was instrumental in rallying support for these bans at the statewide level. *Also in 2019, NRCM worked successfully with the Maine Legislature to pass landmark bills aimed at reforming renewable energy policy, and combatting and mitigating the effects of climate change. Notable members Angus King, US Senator from Maine 2012–present, worked as NRCM's primary legislative lobbyist for a number of years in the 1970s. Jon Hinck, former member of the Maine House of Representatives, contributing founder of Greenpeace U.S.A., and former member of the Portland, Maine city council, acted as staff attorney for the Natural Resources Council of Maine from 2003 to 2006. Hinck's work was vital in the passage of the landmark 2004 electronic waste law, requiring manufacturers for the first time to take responsibility for environmentally sound recycling of certain kinds of electronics, like computers and televisions. Bruce Poliquin, US House of Representatives from Maine's 2nd Congressional District 2014–2019, is a former NRCM board member. Chellie Pingree, US House of Representatives from Maine's 1st Congressional District 2008–present, is a member of NRCM's National Advisory Board. Brownie Carson, Maine State Senator from 2016-present and former member of the Maine House of Representatives, acted as the Executive Director of the Natural Resources Council of Maine from 1984-2011. Carson is widely considered as one of the leading voices on conservation and environmental issues in Maine and the Northeast. Former United States Senator Olympia Snowe called him, 'one of the principal architects of the Maine Environmental Movement.\\" He was awarded the EPA's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. Leon Gorman, former president and chairman of the board of L.L. Bean and grandson of L.L. Bean founder Leon Leonwood Bean, was a member of the Natural Resources Council of Maine's National Advisory Board. George J. Mitchell, former United State Senator/Senate Majority Leader and United States Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, presented the keynote speech at the Natural Resources Council of Maine's 2011 Annual Meeting. Senator Mitchell addressed a number of different issues, including political gridlock in Washington D.C., the success of the Clean Water Act, and the need to keep working to find solutions to the challenges posed by Climate Change. Awards and recognition In 1999, as part of their work with the Kennebec Coalition, NRCM received the Gulf of Maine Visionary Award from the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment. The award recognized the coalition's efforts to remove the Edwards Dam. In 2007, NRCM was celebrated as one the EPA's Climate Award Winners for their \\"demonstrated leader(ship) on climate protection at the state level and beyond\\". Specifically, NRCM received the award for their public education initiatives aimed at informing the cities and citizens of Maine about the dangers of sea-level rise related to climate change and their work in the establishment of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. In 2008, the Natural Resources Council of Maine, as part of the Partners in Penobscot River Restoration Project, received the United States Department of the Interior's Cooperative Conservation Award for their work to restore 11 species of sea-run fish and balance hydropower generation and ecological integrity in the Penobscot river watershed.

In August 2016, Nootrobox partnered with 7-Eleven locations in San Francisco. In June 2017, Nootrobox changed its name to H.V.M.N., which stands for \\"Health Via Modern Nutrition\\". In 2018, HVMN products affiliated with United States Special Operations Command were tested as part of Operation Tech Warrior hosted at the National Center for Medical Readiness. Studies and Results In November 2017, the company's first commissioned clinical trial found that one of its supplements was less effective in many ways than the caffeine (a cup of coffee) used as the control. The company then asked researchers to change the name of the product to distance it from the analysis. The company, however, linked to the study on their website as of 2018. On September 13, 2018, HVMN was the nutrition sponsor for cyclist Vittoria Bussi, who broke the UCI Hour record using HVMN Ketone drinks in the training run up and on the day of the world record.

The building is noted for the tiles that decorate the mihrab and the walls of the prayer hall. Construction and architecture The small mosque was commissioned by Murad II and completed in 1435-6. It originally formed part of a Mevlevi dervish complex but was later converted into a mosque. The complex included a soup kitchen (imaret) and an elementary school (mekteb) but these buildings have not survived. The mosque has a T-shaped plan with a five bay portico and an entrance hall with a domed room on either side. The prayer hall is separated from the entrance hall by a solid arch. The building has been heavily repaired after suffering earthquake damage. The single stone minaret has been rebuilt several times; the present structure dates from 1957. Tiles =Frieze= The prayer hall has a tiled frieze around three walls and a large tiled mihrab set between two windows. The frieze is formed of eight rows of blue-and-white hexagonal tiles that are set on their points. Some of the tiles were stolen in 2001 and the gaps have been filled with plaster. The tiles have a creamy white fritware body and cobalt blue designs under a clear transparent glaze. They measure across. The very varied designs are arranged haphazardly. Most show the influence of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain produced in the early 14th century during the Yuan dynasty. Before the theft in 2001 there were 479 tiles with 53 different designs. Of these, 15 designs occurred only once while the most common design occurred 54 times. Filling the gaps between the hexagonal tiles are plain turquoise glazed triangles. The borders of the frieze are formed by a row of rectangular tiles. Along the top of the frieze are a series of large blue-and-white moulded palmette tiles. =Mihrab= Mihrab with polychrome tiles The exceptionally large rectangular mihrab is formed of moulded polychrome tiles. A tiled inscription on the outer cavetto moulding runs up one side, across the top and down the other side of the mihrab. The cuerda seca cavetto tiles have raised white naskh characters which contrast with the cobalt blue background. Running through the shafts of the naskh characters is a second inscription in yellow Kufic characters. Some of the text on the left side is simply a mirror image of that on the right. The inscriptions include text from the Quran (3:32 - 3:35) and a dedication to Sultan Murad II who ruled between 1421-1444 and again from 1446-1451. The spandrels of the niche consist of elaborate cuerda sec tiles that are decorated with yellow, apple green, turquoise, mauve and cobalt blue glazes. In contrast, the stalactite vault of the niche is formed by white moulded tiles with an underglaze floral decoration in cobalt blue. Some of the floral chinoiserie designs on these tiles repeat those used on the hexagonal blue-and-white tiles of the frieze. =Masters of Tabriz= The style of the polychrome cuerda seca tilework of the mihrab is strikingly similar to that of the mihrab in the Yeşil Mosque (built 1419-21) in Bursa and it is therefore considered likely that the tiles were produced by the same team of craftsmen. In Bursa the craftsmen signed the mihrab as \\"the work of the masters of Tabriz\\". After completing the tiles of the Muradiye mosque it is believed that the \\"Masters of Tabriz\\" also produced the underglaze painted lunette panels of the Üç Şerefeli Mosque (completed in 1447) in Edirne. The blue-and-white hexagonal tiles of the Muradiye Mosque are the earliest example of underglaze painted tiles produced in Ottoman Turkey. They are also the first example of tiles with a frit body produced under the Ottomans. =Tile transfer= Although the walls of the mosque above the tiled frieze are now whitewashed, some of the original painted wall-decoration has been preserved. From the surviving patches of paintwork it is evident that at some point the walls were redecorated with a different design. Strikingly, the tilework appears to have been placed on the walls after the second layer of wall- painting had been applied. This can be clearly seen where the painting runs behind the blue-and-white palmette tiles of the frieze. The art historian John Carswell has argued that although the date of 1435-6 above the entrance fits with the dedication to Murad II on the mihrab, it is probable that the tiles were transferred to the mosque from an imperial building. As supporting evidence he points to the lack of a coherent pattern to the arrangement of hexagonal tiles and the mixing of the two different styles of rectangular border tiles. The mihrab is also unusually large for the size of the building. Carswell suggests that it is likely that the tiles were original made for a building in the palace complex on the plain below. In 1450 Murad II built a palace complex, the Saray-ı Cedid-i Amire (New Imperial Palace), to the north of the city on an island in the river Tunca. The palace was expanded by successive sultans and in the 17th century accommodated between six and ten thousand people. By the early 19th century much of the palace was in ruinous state and almost nothing now survives.

In 1957, the US opened a consulate-general in Mogadishu—the capital of the Trust Territory of Somalia, a UN trusteeship under Italian administration. The consulate was upgraded to embassy status in July 1960, when the US recognized Somalia's independence and appointed an ambassador. The embassy served to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War and also served as a base for the United States Agency for International Development, which had a large presence in the country. In 1989, the embassy moved from a dilapidated building in central Mogadishu to a new compound on the outskirts of the city. Violence quickly enveloped the city in late December 1990, during the Somali Civil War, and on 1 January 1991, the ambassador contacted the State Department to request the closure and evacuation of the embassy. Approval was given the following day, but violence and the collapse of the central government prevented the US, and several other countries, from airlifting their diplomats and civilians through Mogadishu International Airport. and , which were stationed off the coast of Oman, were dispatched to airlift staff from the embassy; American civilians and many foreign diplomats also gathered at the embassy, seeking evacuation. The embassy closed on January 5, 1991 and 281 American and foreign diplomats and civilians were airlifted by helicopter from the embassy compound to Guam and Trenton. In December 1992, the embassy compound was reoccupied and repaired to serve as a headquarters for US personnel within the Unified Task Force and, following the transition to UN control, a base for UNOSOM. The US worked with various parties in Somalia to establish peace and formally recognized the newly established Federal Government of Somalia in January 2013. In May 2015, US Secretary of State John Kerry visited Somalia and stated that the US plans to reopen its embassy soon; the Somali government presented him with the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound in Mogadishu. The move came three months after President Obama nominated Katherine Dhanani to the post of US ambassador to Somalia, who would have been the first US ambassador to Somalia since 1991, but she withdrew three months later. In December 2018, the United States established a permanent diplomatic mission in Mogadishu. On October 2, 2019, the United States announced the reestablishment of the United States Embassy in Mogadishu. History The State Department sent two consuls to Mogadishu in 1956 to establish a diplomatic post and on July 1, 1957, the United States Consulate-General in Mogadishu opened. The consulate was an offshoot of the US embassy to Italy. At the time, Mogadishu was the capital of the Trust Territory of Somalia, a United Nations Trust Territory under Italian administration that was scheduled to become independent in 1960. In addition to establishing a presence, the consulate staff were also charged with political research and developing relations with future Somali leaders. On July 1, 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) became independent and united, as planned, with the briefly extant State of Somaliland (the former British Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic (Somalia). The United States recognized and established diplomatic relations with the Somali Republic the same day. The consulate-general was elevated to embassy status and its Chargé d'affaires, Andrew G. Lynch, was appointed ambassador on July 5. He presented his credentials on 11 July, at which point he officially became the first US ambassador to Somalia. Like most US diplomatic posts in Africa during the Cold War, a primary purpose of the embassy was to counter Soviet influence in the region and contain the spread of communism. For a time after the Sino-Soviet split, China was also actively competing for influence in the developing world, including activities in Somalia. Beginning in the 1960s, the US engaged in development projects in Somalia to counter the influence of communism. Staff from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which carried out most of these projects, comprised a substantial number of the embassy's staff during the next three decades. Educational programs were also given emphasis by the embassy in the years after independence, and there was a sizable Peace Corps presence. The US became the protecting power for the United Kingdom in Somalia after Somalia severed diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in 1963, due to a dispute over the administration of the ethnic-Somali Northern Frontier District. Besides providing consular assistance for Britons, the embassy was also tasked with the protection of the British embassy compound and its properties. The US opened a consulate in Hargeisa the following year to assist Peace Corps activities and represent British interests in the northwestern region of Somalia, which had been under British administration from 1884-1960. In 1967, the embassy went into a lock down during the Six-Day War between Israel and neighboring Arab countries, which Somalia supported. The US was viewed as Israel's protector by Somalis and the embassy was subjected to some minor demonstrations. During the 1969 coup d'état which brought Siad Barre to power, the embassy was blockaded by soldiers, who prevented the movement of persons into or out of the compound for over 24 hours. Only the ambassador managed to briefly visit the embassy en route to the Foreign Ministry, where he made a formal complaint against the embassy's blockade. In the wake of the coup, the Somali government became patrons of the Soviet Union and China. Three days after the coup, the Peace Corps was ordered to leave within three days. This soon extended to one week, and many of the volunteers were housed in the homes of embassy staff before being evacuated by a US Air Force plane. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibited foreign assistance to nations whose ships engaged in trade with Vietnam. After Somali-flagged vessels were observed at port in Hanoi, US development assistance to Somalia was terminated. The Barre government responded by expelling the US military attaché, prohibiting local residents from visiting the embassy, and restricting travel by embassy staff to within of Mogadishu. The consulate in Hargeisa was closed and the USAID program, which had more staff than the rest of the embassy, ended. However, in the late 1970s, the Soviets became patrons of Ethiopia and in the wake of the Ogaden War between Somalia and Ethiopia, Somalia turned to the West for support. The US sought access to airports and ports in Somalia in exchange for military equipment and economic aid. In July 1989, the embassy moved to a new, compound on the outskirts of Mogadishu—the largest US embassy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The site had been acquired by the US in the mid-1960s and later turned into a golf course that was frequented by embassy staff. =Prelude to closure= In the late 1980s, there was increasing rebellion against the rule of President Siad Barre and by 1990, the country began to descend into civil war. Criminal violence was also increasing. In 1990, seasoned diplomat James K. Bishop was appointed US Ambassador to Somalia. In 1967, Bishop was at the US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon when the Six-Day War erupted, which prompted the evacuation of about 3,600 Americans in 33 hours; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and Marines that remained in the city during the conflict. Ambassador Bishop also gained valuable experience organizing evacuations of several embassies in the 1980s while serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa. In his previous post, as US ambassador to Liberia, Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread, when he left in March 1990. Ambassador Bishop returned to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia, but he was soon appointed to a taskforce to deal with the crisis in Liberia, which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August. Aware of the violence going on in the Somali countryside, Ambassador Bishop felt \\"the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances.\\" On August 1, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the military command for the Middle East and Northeast Africa—where he worked with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E&E;) plan until he was \\"satisfied...that [Central Command] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that.\\" A few hours after his visit, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The US was mobilizing assets for a response when Ambassador Bishop arrived in Mogadishu on September 6. The primary interest of the Ambassador was to maintain the US military's permission and access to airfields and ports in Mogadishu and Berbera, which the US had negotiated in 1979. This was especially important given the mobilization for intervention in Kuwait, Somalia's strategic location near the Arabian Peninsula and the mouth of the Red Sea, and because Saudi Arabia would not allow US troops on their soil. The embassy was also home to a large number of USAID staff, although the spread of unrest into the countryside was making their work increasingly difficult. The Somali Civil War spread through the country during 1990 and late in the year there was an increasing level of criminal violence in Mogadishu. By December, the security situation began to deteriorate significantly and on December 5, Ambassador Bishop told an audience at a standing-room only meeting that he was recommending the voluntary evacuation of all dependents (i.e. children and spouses of diplomatic staff) and non- essential personnel. By December 19, the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 and of the 90 private Americans in the city, half were estimated to have left. Small-arms fire became a daily occurrence and stray bullets and shells were landing in the embassy complex. On December 30, violence escalated significantly as rebel groups entered the city, although the ambassador claimed the nature and extent of the violence was not immediately clear. On December 30–31, diplomats, including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city, were collected and housed in the ambassador's residence, the marine house, and the K-7 compound located across Afgoy Road. On the morning of December 31, the defense attaché was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening, a soldier at a roadblock shot the tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official. Attempts by the US and other nations' diplomats, in particular the Italian embassy, to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful. Afgoy Road became a \\"shooting gallery,\\" preventing those in safe-havens outside the embassy to reach it. On New Year's Day, the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy. =Closure and evacuation= Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on January 1, 1991, indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian, French, or German evacuation efforts, but that he preferred an evacuation by the US military. The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military, thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit. Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing contingency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts. Ultimately, ten heads of missions—eight ambassadors and two chargés d'affaires—along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated. Initial plans called for the United States Air Force to dispatch two transport aircraft to Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the aircraft to land at the airport and it also became clear that it was too dangerous to travel from the embassy to the airport. Meanwhile, and began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu with forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. On January 4, several incidents, including several exchanges of gunfire, suggested that the embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on January 7. The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element of Marines from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning. Two helicopters carrying a 60-man security detail—51 Marines and 9 US Navy SEALs—reached the embassy compound on the morning of January 5 and left with 61 evacuees. Throughout the day US and foreign nationals seeking evacuation arrived at the embassy compound, including the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff from the Soviet Union's embassy. Meanwhile, the embassy compound was prepared for the main evacuation, which occurred in the early morning hours of January 6. The first of four waves of helicopters—three for civilians and the fourth for the security detail and ambassador—left the ships at midnight (UTC+4). The final wave reached the ships at 03:43. A total of 281 evacuees were taken from the embassy, including eight ambassadors (and two other heads of missions) and 61 Americans. Armed looters were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by rocket-propelled grenades within two hours of the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.The United States has reopened its embassy in Mogadishu nearly three decades after Somalia collapsed into civil war on October 2,2019. Ambassador Donald Yamamoto said that the reopening reflected progress in the Horn of Africa country in recent years and the partnership between the two countries. Embassy compound Left side of the embassy compound in December 1992. The chancery, with its own wall, is in the foreground with the USIS building (bottom right). The JAO building is barely visible in the upper right, with the Marine House to its left (top, right of center). The golf course was beyond the wall in the upper left. When this photo was taken, the embassy compound was being cleared to serve as UNITAF headquarters. The first US consuls in Mogadishu set up their initial office in a small room in the city's Public Works Department building. Shortly thereafter, an Italian contractor built the first US chancery in downtown Mogadishu. According to John Blane, the vice consul in Mogadishu from 1956 to 1957, the first chancery was \\"a rather miserable effort.\\" He \\"felt that if it stood up for five years, we would be extremely lucky,\\" but the building remained the US chancery for three decades. By the time it closed, the old chancery was one of the most dilapidated buildings the State Department had, according to Ambassador Bishop. In July 1989, the embassy was relocated to a new, compound along Afgoy Road in the local K-7 district. The grounds consisted of the Chancery, the Joint Administrative Office (JAO), Marine House (for the Marine Security Guards), the ambassador's residence, a building for the United States Information Service, an American school, a recreational complex for the local expatriate community, a water tower, and various storage and maintenance buildings. The recreational complex, which comprised about half of the compound, included a pool, tennis courts, and a golf course. Outside the walled embassy, the US maintained the K-7 complex, an apartment complex for embassy staff located across Afgoy Road, as well as the Office for Military Cooperation. Both were situated one and a half blocks from the embassy proper. The ambassador's residence was largely constructed in glass, had no protective barriers, and its top story overlooked the embassy's walls. Ambassador Bishop therefore ordered that some bars be installed across the glass as an additional security protective measure. =After closure= US Navy Seabees within the Unified Task Force constructing a kitchen and dining facility at the US Embassy compound in Mogadishu After the failure of UNOSOM in 1991-2, the US led a multinational mission—UNITAF—which included military forces to ensure aid was distributed to Somalis. The US military entered Mogadishu on December 9, 1992, and moved to quickly secure the abandoned embassy, along with the airport and port. The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3 m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, and bodies were found in some areas on the premises. Personnel promptly set out cleaning the compound's living spaces and work areas to make room for the arrival and assembly area. Old warehouses were razed, and new barracks, heads and galleys were erected in their place. US Navy support elements that arrived later also imported extra materials. US President George H. W. Bush visited the headquarters at the former embassy during his three-day visit to Somalia from December 31 to January 2. A Somali-language radio station—Radio Rajo—broadcast from the former embassy compound. On May 4, 1993, the mission transitioned from US to UN control and the name changed from UNITAF (Operation Restore Hope) to UNOSOM II (Operation Provide Comfort). Accordingly, the embassy premises were occupied by UN personnel to serve as headquarters for UNOSOM II. The US military withdrew from the mission in March 1994 and all UN and US personnel were withdrawn in March 1995. United States' diplomatic mission to Somalia The US has not had a diplomatic mission in Somalia since the closure of the embassy in 1991. Nonetheless, the US never officially severed diplomatic relations with Somalia. The US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya serves as a base for the US diplomatic mission to Somalia, which is currently led by the US Special Representative on Somalia James McAnulty. The US worked with various parties throughout Somalia to establish peace and a centralized government. On 17 January 2013, the US formally recognized the Federal Government of Somalia, which was established in August 2012. In June 2014, the State Department announced that the United States would reopen its diplomatic mission, without specifying a timeline but only that it would be \\"soon\\". In February 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama nominated Foreign Service veteran Katherine Dhanani to become the new Ambassador of the United States to Somalia, but her nomination was withdrawn the following May. US Secretary of State John Kerry visited Mogadishu in May 2015 and announced that the US planned to reopen an embassy in Mogadishu. He indicated that, although there was no set timetable for the premises' relaunch, the US government has begun upgrading its diplomatic representation in the country. President of Somalia Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke presented to Kerry the real estate deed for land reserved for the new US embassy compound. In December 2018, the United States reopened a \\"permanent diplomatic presence\\" in Mogadishu. The new mission will not have full embassy status until October 2019. Some diplomatic staff are expected to remain at the US Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya where the U.S. Mission to Somalia is based. The U.S. Mission to Somalia is headed by Ambassador Donald Yamamoto.

When asked about her motivations, Bertolucci said \\"I have always been a positive, motivated person, but there was a time when I didn't feel like I was living my best life. Things were certainly going well and my life looked good on paper: a former model, a well- paid corporate job, a nice house, car and boyfriend. But I felt like I was living someone else’s life; my success felt two-dimensional.” She has recounted that she eventually hit a “quarter-life crisis” where, although everything in her life seemed sufficient, she expected more and felt unfulfilled. She soon realised there was a different path to happiness that she had to take. Using the expertise she had gained while developing teams, she created a method to success which she began to teach. She worked as a life coach and a success coach, which she defines as similar to a 'life coach' but generally dealing with both life and business challenges for entrepreneurial and senior executive clients. Writing and career Returning to Australia in 2003 to found her own firm, Success Strategies, she began working with corporate and entrepreneurial clients, teaching them optimal techniques in leadership, personal motivation, and achieving success. Her firm offers several courses and workshops in personal development programs for both the general public and companies who recognise the economic impact of efficient and content employees..” In 2006, she re-branded her firm as the Domonique Bertolucci Company (DBC). She is a speaker for professional settings. Bertolucci has developed a criterion of goal-setting for her clients and readers that involves ranking values and prioritising those most important, called the Personal Happiness Prescription. Bertolucci believes that personal happiness is a choice, and maintaining it is a result of the decisions a person has made. She outlines several simple steps to living a happier life that require a change of perspective. Building upon this, she develops a system for long term happiness and balance that would avoid any sense of burnout. This “burnout” she states affects many high-level executives and business-people whose lives are imbalanced due to too much focus on one criterion. She comments that most people push themselves towards a goal that is not ultimately consistent with their life values. They put much more time and energy into goals and possessions that will not fundamentally increase their happiness. Trying too hard at any one thing, whether it be career or relationship oriented, will have detrimental effects that reduce overall life satisfaction. She coaches even small steps towards this goal, minor increments perhaps, are enough to begin simplification, leaving a person “relaxed and happy, instead of stressed and overwhelmed.” She has been featured in interviews for publications on lifestyle and business topics, including Sunrise (Ch7), the Today Show (Ch9), Cosmopolitan, The Sydney Morning Herald, “The Sunday Telegraph (UK). Bertolucci was also interviewed by Weight Watchers where she explained that her goal-setting methods can also be used to lose weight. She is an author of several books on achieving happiness and success through several techniques and psychological changes. Bertolucci encourages her readers to see happiness as a state of being, not one of doing or having. Bertolucci outlines that taking risks is often an important step in attaining happiness. While small steps can further a goal, it is important to identify what will truly bring about happiness, which can often involve some amount of personal risk. She believes there are two types of fear: a negative kind that limits people from achievement and a positive kind that gives motivation. Bertolucci has commented that it is necessary to overcome the negative effects of fear to properly channel this energy. Furthermore, she stresses the importance of reasonable goal setting, which both makes happiness more attainable while reducing the negative effects of fear and anxiety. She has also written extensively on methods for improved personal relations, whether it be with friends, romantic partners, or business contacts. Attitude and genuine interest will naturally attract others' attention and increase rapport. She believes there are several varied friend types that a person should have to achieve a well-rounded world view and thus richer happiness. She has said \\"you need different types of friends in the same way that you need food from different food groups. Different types of friends serve different purposes and nourish and enrich our lives in different ways.\\" =Books= *Your Best Life (2006), *The Happiness Code (2012), *Love Your Life (2013), *100 Days Happier (2013), *Less is More (2014), *The Kindness Pact (2015). Personal life Bertolucci splits her time living in Sydney and London with her husband. They have two children together. She is an ambitious home cook and enjoys reading in her spare time.

It was originally discovered by Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters of Capodimonte Observatory, Naples, Italy. There was insufficient data to accurately compute the orbit, and the comet was lost for well over a hundred years. It was accidentally rediscovered by Malcolm Hartley at the UK Schmidt Telescope Unit, Siding Spring, Australia on a photographic plate exposed on 11 July 1982. He estimated its brightness at a magnitude of 15. The sighting was confirmed by the Perth Observatory, where M. C. Candy calculated the orbit and concluded that Hartley had indeed relocated the lost Peter's comet. I. Hasegawa and Syuichi Nakano had simultaneously reached the same conclusion. It was observed at its next apparition in 1990 by R. H. McNaught of the Siding Spring observatory, who described as diffuse with a brightness of magnitude 14. It was subsequently observed in 1998, 2006 and 2014.
