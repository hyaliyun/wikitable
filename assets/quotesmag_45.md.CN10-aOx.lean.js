It was founded on 31 October 1861 by Muncherjee Hormusji Cama and Dadabhai Naoroji. At the time of its founding, it was reported that there were approximately fifty Zoroastrians present in England who were mainly students. However, Zoroastrians have been present in the United Kingdom long before the foundation of the ZTFE; the first known Parsi arrival being Nowroji Rustom Maneck Sett (Nowroji Rustomji) in 1721 or 1724. Currently there are around 5,000 members of the ZTFE. The secretariat and principal venue attached to the organisation is Zoroastrian Centre located in the Rayners Lane area of Harrow. The centre is the Grade II* listed Art Deco former Ace Cinema. Additionally the ZTFE also manage the \\"Parsee burial ground\\" established in 1862, at Brookwood Cemetery which is the only operating Zoroastrian burial ground in Europe.Zoroastrian graves at Brookwood Cemetery Zoroastrian building at Brookwood Cemetery Notable visitors to The Zoroastrian Centre in recent years include Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; Dr Rowan Williams; the Archbishop of Canterbury; Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex; and Sophie, Countess of Wessex. History The first formal move to organise the growing Parsi community in the United Kingdom was from Muncherjee Cama, who was joined by Dadabhai Naoroji in a circular letter to the fifty Parsis they knew to be in London in 1861. The Zoroastrian Trust Funds of Europe was initially founded as Europena Zarthost Dharmanu Khatu (The Religious Funds of the Zoroastrians in Europe in Gujarati), in Kensington, London; the first meeting was attended by fifteen Parsis at Cama's residence at 24 Devonshire Terrace. The Religious Funds of the Zoroastrians of Europe existed to purchase land for the burial of the dead; to help stranded or destitute Zoroastrians; to purchase and produce books on Zoroastrianism; to fund research on Zoroastrianism; to establish a 'House of Prayer'; and as a general fund for miscellaneous expenses. Under its regulations four of the seven managing trustees were to be students, with other members representing the association at the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge and University of Edinburgh. Whilst the association initially consisted of Parsis only, they were active in campaigning for the rights of the persecuted Zoroastrians in Iran. Dadabhai Naoroji and Mancherjee Bhownagree, both presidents of the ZTFE and MPs, addressed the House of Commons on this issue. On the six occasions Shah Naser al-Din Shah Qajar visited London, Parsi delegations from the ZTFE were present to advocate for their Iranian co-religionists suffering intense persecution under the Qajar dynasty.

She was \\"the undisputed grande dame of Kentucky textile arts.\\" A historic marker notes her achievements in Shepherdsville, where Lesch lived and had her studio. Lesch's quilt, Bathshebas Bedspread, was included in the Objects USA exhibit in 1969, which was organized by S.C. Johnson and Son. Early life Lesch began her first quilt at the age of five, completing it seven years later. She graduated from Murray State University in 1941 and earned a master's degree in education from the University of Louisville in 1962. Career Lesch taught at the Louisville School of Art and the University of Louisville. She also taught at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts and Arrowmont School of Crafts. Her style frequently used found objects, quilting of personal garments, and embroidery in her works. Her fiber portraits are fabric collages made from antique clothing, however they intentionally exclude the subject's face and limbs, allowing the viewer to imagine the subject. She pioneered this style of portrait in the 1960s, in which she arranged \\"clothing stitched on to a quilt as though they were positioned for a portrait.\\" Although her contemporary, Marilyn Pappas, used a similar technique, Lesch's portraits are unique in that they touch on the themes of her life lived in Kentucky, including farming, social manners, and folk art. Lesch influenced other artists such as Jane Burch Cochran. She was named a Master Craftsman by the World Craft Council in 1974 and a Fellow of the Kentucky Guild of Artists and Craftsmen in 1986. She won the Kentucky Governor's Award for Lifetime Contribution to Visual Arts in 1987.

Incident  Police received 9-1-1 calls about a man standing in the street waving a knife. Dispatchers told police that Mann had a knife and gun, and that he was acting erratically. Mann was carrying a 4-inch knife when police encountered him, but no gun was ever found. Mann did not cooperate with the first officers who arrived at the scene. Mann's family describes him as \\"doing karate moves and zigzagging back and forth across the street as he tried to walk away from the officers.\\" The initial responding officers ordered Mann to drop his knife, and get on the ground. He did not comply, and instead threw a thermos at the police cruiser, and shouted threats as he walked down Del Paso Boulevard. When Lozoya and Tennis arrived, their cruiser's dash cam audio recorded one of them as saying, \\"Fuck this guy. I'm going to hit him.\\" The other officer replies, \\"Okay. Go for it. Go for it.\\" They missed Mann the first time, and attempted again to try to hit him with their cruiser. As they accelerated toward Mann, one officer said, \\"Watch it! Watch! Watch\\", as Mann jumped into the median strip to avoid the cruiser. After missing Mann the second time, the other officer said, \\"We'll get him. We'll get him.\\" They stopped the cruiser, exited it, and chased Mann on foot. The officers fatally shot Mann moments later. Police fired 18 shots, 14 of which hit Mann. The Sacramento Bee suggested that Mann was about 27 feet from the officers when he was shot. Mann died at the scene.  Aftermath  The shooting led to protests by local religious leaders and Black leaders. Black Lives Matter demanded the release of the dash cam videos, and criticized the police for escalating the situation. The Sacramento Police Department initially did not release the videos, but later released three dash cam videos and two 9-1-1 call audios after pressure from city officials, including Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, as well as The Sacramento Bee, obtaining surveillance footage from a citizen showing the shooting of Mann. The audio of the dash cam videos was enhanced by The Sacramento Bee. A toxicology report found that Mann had methamphetamine in his system. Police spokesperson Bryce Heinlein told reporters that using a vehicle as a deadly weapon is something covered in use of force training. According to Heinlein, Lozoya and Tennis were placed on \\"modified duty\\". Mann's family has filed both a claim against Sacramento, and also a federal lawsuit. In addition to other shootings by police officers around the country, Mann's shooting prompted the Sacramento City Council to propose a use-of-force policy change which restricts the use of lethal force, and examines the use of police vehicles. On January 27, 2017, the Sacramento County District Attorney cleared the two officers of any legal wrongdoing, concluding that they were justified in shooting Mann, but after an internal investigation by the Sacramento Police Department, neither Tennis nor Lozoya remain on the force.

Half-harmonic generation (also called wavelength doubling or frequency halving) is a nonlinear optical process in which photons \\"split\\" to generate pairs of new photons with half the energy, therefore half the frequency and twice the wavelength of the initial photons. The half-harmonic generation process is the inverse of second-harmonic generation and can occur in optical parametric oscillators at degeneracy, and is a phase and frequency locked down-conversion process. In the continuous wave regime, stable half-harmonic generation in an optical parametric oscillator was experimentally demonstrated in 1990, and in the femtosecond regime, it was experimentally demonstrated in 2012. Half- harmonic generation is used as a phase and frequency locked down conversion process for generation of mid-infrared frequency combs using near-infrared frequency combs, and a conversion efficiency of ~64% is experimentally demonstrated. Half-harmonic generation can also lead to generation of different quantum states of light, for instance below the oscillation threshold it can lead to generation of squeezed vacuum, and around threshold it can potentially generate cat states.

He was known as the \\"crate boy\\" for Jazzy Jay, who was the DJ for Afrika Bambaataa. He later publicly reported in 2016 that Bambaataa sexually molested him. Hon. Ronald Savage at a Press Release  Early life  Growing up in the Castle Hill Houses in The Bronx, Savage became a member of the Universal Zulu Nation at the age of 14. Savage used to spend time with D.J Jazzy Jay while he recorded records in the early 1980s. Savage states, \\"The best time I had in hip hop, when I was a kid was being paid after the parties, we were being paid (by Bambaataa) in White Castles Hamburgers\\".  Music career  Savage got his start in the music industry in 1986 when Jazzy Jay built his recording studio in the Bronx on Blondell Ave. He paid his dues by running errands for Jazzy. In 1986, Jazzy Jay teamed up with Rocky Bucano to start Strong City Records. Soon, Jazzy moved the label to Allerton Ave in the Bronx, where Savage convinced the DJ's to play records of Strong City artists on rap radio and in rap clubs. soon after in 1988 Strong City Records was acquired by MCA Records to become Strong City / MCA / Uni Records. There, Savage worked on Strong City Record acts such as Busy Bee Starski, Def Duo, Ultimate Force, Ice Cream Tee, Nu Sounds, BZ2 M.C.'s, and other groups like Brand Nubian, Showbiz & A.G, Fat Joe, which all worked out of Jazzy Jay Studios. A few years later, he left Strong City Records and began working for Dick Scott Entertainment the management company for the New Kids on The Block, Marky Mark, Boys to Men. At Dick Scott Entertainment, Savage worked as an artist liaison for the rap group Snap!, whose single \\"I Got The Power\\" went #1 on the weekly charts in Spain, UK, Netherlands, Switzerland, as well as the Eurochart Hot 100. In 1990 the song hit #2 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Savage also handled for Dick Scott Entertainment other groups as Doug E Fresh, Ikey Cee, and Show Biz & A.G. In 1990 while working with the rap pop group SNAP Ronald \\"Bee-Stinger\\" Savage carved the term Six elements of the Hip Hop Movement. The Six Elements Of The Hip Hop Movement are: Consciousness Awareness, Civil Rights Awareness, Activism Awareness, Justice, Political Awareness, Community Awareness. While working as an artist liaison at Dick Scott Entertainment, he suffered a mild stroke from the constant stress at his job which ended his career in the music industry. Ronald Savage states about his released single in 2018 \\"Hip Hop Movement Anthem\\": \\"I'm not rapping on the single, this is an arrangement of classic Hip Hop beats for the clubs and DJ’s to bring fun and peace back to the forefront of Hip-Hop.\\" Music Release Date: September 20, 2018 (Single) - Hip Hop Movement Anthem - Ron \\"Bee-Stinger\\" Savage Music Release Date: January 11, 2019 (Single) - Keep Goin - Ron \\"Bee- Stinger\\" Savage  Non-profit and political work  In 2005, Savage started a non-profit organization called United Coalition Association. Its mission is to fight juvenile delinquency and counteract negative behavior in youth. It also organizes college fairs to prepare students the entrance to college. Savage also appeared in PSAs encouraging youth to stay away from gang activity, which aired on TV stations such as MTV and VH1. In 2008, Savage was elected to the New York State Democratic Committee with the help of former NYS Assemblyman Peter M Rivera. Savage was honored by the NAACP with an award in recognition of his devotion and commitment and uplifting youth in the community. Ronald Savage is also the founder of the New York State College Fair Day. He also created a DVD called The Plan which provides information about entrance to college. In 2011 Savage marched with Occupy Wall Street protesters in New York. \\"We just drew up a resolution to raise taxes on the rich,\\" he said. \\"I hope it makes it to the floor. The mayor and the governor need to be more egalitarian toward the poor and the working class. This protest and protests from around the world show strength in numbers. It's global. The people are tired,\\" he said. In 2011, Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr. did not reappoint Savage, then a New York State Democratic Committeeman for the 76th Assembly District, to local Bronx Community Board 9 in the Soundview area of the Bronx, due to the fact that Savage helped Charlie Ramos (a candidate for senate) in the 2011 September primary elections against Ruben Diaz Jr's father, New York state Sen. Rubén Díaz Sr. In 2016, Savage reported that Afrika Bambaataa molested him at the age of 15 in 1980. Former Hot 97 host Troi Torain aka STAR of the Star & Buc Wild Show in New York City broke the story on the Shot 97 internet radio show. On April 9, the exclusive story appeared in the New York Daily News. The Universal Zulu Nation apologized to Savage, after three more men came forth with accounts of being abused by Bambaataa after the story was published. Savage has also fought to help change the statute of limitations laws in New York State against child molesters. Savage was featured on the 2016 single \\"Don't Close Your Eyes\\" produced by Jonathan Hay, where he spoke over Bambaataa's song \\"Planet Rock\\" which was replayed in the track. Savage speaks out about child molestation and issues a very bold challenge to the President of the United States, stating, “Children are being molested every day. I was molested by a world Hip-Hop icon,” states Savage. “My question is to the President of the United States of America: what are you going to do about the child molestation crisis of America?”. Savage also stated in an interview in London, \\"I don’t recognize the term hip hop Culture because that is a term Bambaataa coined and I don’t know what his intention was when he coined the term, but what I do recognize is hip hop and I salute the rebirth of the hip hop movement\\".

Founded in 1928 as a speakeasy, the eatery is one of two Minneapolis establishments that claim to have invented the Juicy Lucy cheeseburger in the 1950s, the other being Matt's Bar. The Club also serves its Saucy Sally burger and other dishes including fried cheese curds and onion straws. The restaurant, which has been featured on several Travel Channel TV series, has three additional locations in Minnesota. History The Club Tavern & Grill opened in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1928 at the intersection of 58th Street and Cedar Avenue, with 58th Street lending its name to the establishment. Founded during the United States' Prohibition Era (1920–1933), the club started illegally as a speakeasy in a stucco-sided residence in a relatively non-urbanized area to the city's south. The club's proprietors built a subterranean garage below the house to aid them in illegally transporting alcohol. In honor of its past as a speakeasy, the rear entrance to the Club remains the main entrance. Three additional Club locations have been opened, in Maplewood, Champlin, and West Saint Paul, Minnesota. The restaurant was acquired by Food Services Inc. in 1996. Menu =Juicy Lucy= A 5-8 Club Juicy Lucy The Club's signature menu item is its Juicy Lucy cheeseburger which consists of cheese cooked inside a patty of Angus beef. There is contention between the Club and Matt's Bar, another Minneapolis eatery located 23 blocks north of the Club on Cedar Avenue, about which establishment invented the burger. According to the Club, they developed the dish in the 1950s. The version served by the club is spelled Juicy Lucy, while the Matt's Bar iteration omits the letter I, resulting in a spelling of Jucy Lucy. Unlike Matt's Jucy Lucys, the Club's Juicy Lucys are offered with the option of four different cheeses: American, blue, pepper jack, and Swiss. In order to avoid confusion in the preparation process, patties being grilled are tagged with colored toothpicks corresponding the type of cheese inside. The restaurant serves as many as 300 of the cheeseburgers each day. Referencing the different spellings of their respective burgers, waitstaff at the Club have donned shirts imploring that \\"If it's spelled right, it's done right.\\" The club sells T-shirts reading \\"Free the Cheese\\" in contrast to shirts offered at Matt's that read \\"Fear the Cheese\\". =Other dishes= The 5-8 Club's onion straws In addition to Juicy Lucys, the Club serves other dishes, including fried cheese curds, pork tenderloin sandwiches, potato wedges, and onion straws. The Saucy Sally, a variation on the Juicy Lucy consisting of a secret sauce cooked into a beef patty and served with a variety of toppings (onions, cheese, lettuce, and Thousand Island dressing) is served at the eatery. In March 2016, the Club began its Brewer's Burger program, allowing a new local craft brewer to develop a limited-time burger–beer pairing each month. The restaurant offers \\"free refills 'till you float\\" on beverages. Reception Citing the variety of cheeses offered in the patties, George Motz described the Club's Juicy Lucys as an upscale version of the dish. Dara Moskowitz Grumdahl described the bar's Juicy Lucy in City Pages as a \\"big, sizzling, dense, and tender burger filled with good cheese\\" while Thrillists Kevin Alexander disagreed, writing that the patty \\"lacked serious flavor and the cheese didn't burn [his] tongue as much as just surrender en masse on [his] plate after an initial bite.\\" Of the ambiance, Motz wrote that in spite of \\"its clinical-looking rear entrance\\", the bar has a \\"comfortable dining room with a large outdoor patio.\\" James Norton commented that the eatery \\"has a clean, bright suburban sheen to it more evocative of a well-maintained Applebee's than a hole-in-the-wall tavern\\" and Alexander compared the restaurant's exterior to \\"the rectory of a pretty happening church\\". The Club was ranked first among the 101 restaurants featured on the second season of the Travel Channel's Chowdown Countdown in 2014. The restaurant has also appeared on two other Travel Channel shows: Man v. Food in 2009 and Food Wars in 2010.

A Washington Post columnist called him \\"the most famous squirrel ever to come from Washington.\\"  World War II  While origin stories vary, Tommy was adopted in 1942 by Zaidee Bullis and her husband Mark C. Bullis, who may have named him after the 18th-century nursery-rhyme character Little Tommy Tucker. Zaidee dressed Tommy in women's clothing to avoid the tailoring around his bushy tail that a male wardrobe would entail. Following World War II Tommy \\"married\\" a squirrel named Buzzy. In 1943 the Bullis family began taking Tommy on tour in their Packard automobile, accompanied by a bulldog said to have one or more gold teeth and often wearing a fez. Audiences were charmed by Tommy's lovingly craftedoften patrioticattire and unusually docile demeanor (though he did sometimes bite). In an early show he performed for 500 elementary school students, and in conjunction with war bond sales Tommy gave a purported radio interview alongside President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1944 Tommy was featured in Life magazine, complete with a gallery of photos by Nina Leen. The article noted that \\"Mrs. Bullis' main interest in Tommy... is in dressing him up in 30 specially made costumes. Tommy has a coat and hat for going to market, a silk pleated dress for company, a Red Cross uniform for visiting the hospital.\\" In 1945, at the height of his fame, the Tommy Tucker Club had some 30,000 members.  Later life  After the war, Tommy largely disappeared from headlines until 1948, when the Bullises were denied entry to California for several days when agricultural officials refused to recognize Tommy as a pet rather than a wild animal. At another point Tommy was barred from visiting Mexico. Tommy died in the Bullises' trailer on June 25, 1949 while en route to one of the couple's \\"health and pleasure trips\\" to the Southwest United States, ostensibly due to \\"a heart attack brought on by old age\\" (The average lifespan of Eastern gray squirrels in captivity is about twenty years.) His body was stuffed and mounted \\"with his arms out so you could pull the clothes over him.\\" In 2005 Tommy's remains were offered to the Smithsonian, which however failed to show much interest. He is on view in a display case at a law office in Prince George's County, Maryland. The Archives Center at the National Museum of American History holds a collection of articles, papers, and photographs related to Tommy Tucker.

He emigrated to the United States and enlisted in the U.S. Army in Baltimore, Maryland. Spending much of his military career after the Civil War on the frontier, McNamara participated in campaigns against the Southern Plains Indians for over 20 years, becoming a veteran Indian fighter.

Though vastly outnumbered, MacKenzie ordered an attack hoping to catch the Comanche by surprise. The soldiers approached, however, startled the Indian's ponies and started a stampede alerting the camp.

There are currently four different versions of the test that are structured to include interviews with both the child and the parents or guardians. The K-SADS serves to diagnose childhood mental disorders in school-aged children 6-18. The different adaptations of the K-SADS were written by different researchers and are used to screen for many affective and psychotic disorders. Versions of the K-SADS are semi-structured interviews administered by health care providers or highly trained clinical researchers, which gives more flexibility to the interviewer about how to phrase and probe items, while still covering a consistent set of disorders. Due to its semi-structured interview format, time to complete the administration varies based on the youth/adult being interviewed. Most versions of the K-SADS also include \\"probes\\", if these are endorsed, another diagnostic category will be reviewed. If the probe is not endorsed, additional symptoms for that particular disorder will not be queried. The K-SADS has been found to be reliable and valid in multiple research and treatment settings.  Versions  = KSADS-Present Version (KSADS-P) = The KSADS-P was the first version of the K-SADS, developed by Chambers and Puig-Antich in 1978 as a version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia adapted for use with children and adolescents 6–19 years old. This version rephrased the SADS to make the wording of the questionnaire pertain to a younger age group. For example, mania symptoms in children might be manifest differently than in adulthood (e.g., children might have not have the same opportunity to spend money impulsively, nor would they likely have access to credit cards or checking accounts; instead, they might give away all their favorite toys or empty their parent's wallet to gain spending money). The KSADS-P is a structured interview given by trained clinicians or clinical researchers who interview both the child and the parent. This original version assesses symptoms that have occurred in the most current episode (within the week preceding the interview), as well as symptoms that have occurred within the last 12 months. The KSADS-P has many limitations: it does not assess lifetime symptoms and history, does not include many psychiatric diagnoses of interest in childhood (such as autistic spectrum disorders), and does not include diagnosis specific impairment ratings. = KSADS-Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL) = The K-SADS-PL is used to screen for affective and psychotic disorders as well as other disorders, including, but not limited to Major Depressive Disorder, Mania, Bipolar Disorders, Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Conduct Disorder, Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This semi-structured interview takes 45–75 minutes to administer. It was written by Joan Kaufman, Boris Birmaher, David Brent, Uma Rao, and Neal Ryan. The majority of items in the K-SADS-PL are scored using a 0–3 point rating scale. Scores of 0 indicate no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present; scores of 2 indicate sub- threshold presentation and scores of 3 indicate threshold presentation of symptoms. The KSADS-PL has six components: ; Unstructured Introductory Interview – Developmental History : The first part of the interview asks about developmental history and the history of the presenting problem. The interviewer takes detailed notes on the record sheet. Prompts cover basic demographic information, physical and mental health history and prior treatments, current complaints, and the youth’s relations with friends, family, school, and hobbies. This section allows flexibility for the interviewer to collect more information on questions that need elaboration. ; Diagnostic Screening Interview : The diagnostic screening interview reviews the most severe current and past symptoms. There are probes and scoring criteria for each symptom presented. Symptoms of disorders are grouped into modules. If the patient does not display any current or past symptoms for the screening questions, then the rest of the module's questions do not need to be asked. ; Completion Checklist Supplement : A supplemental checklist is used to screen for additional disorders. ; Appropriate Diagnostic Supplements : These supplements review presence/absence of symptoms for other disorders, including anxiety disorders, behavioral disorders, and substance abuse. ; Summary Lifetime Diagnosis Checklist : Based on the previous sections, this section summarizes which disorders have been present from first episode to now. ; Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS) : Scores the child’s level of functioning. = KSADS-Epidemiological (KSADS-E) = The KSADS-E, which is the epidemiological version of the KSADS, is a tool to interview parents about possible psychopathology in children from preschool onward. It was developed by Puig-Antich, Orvaschel, Tabrizi, and Chambers in 1980 as a structured interview. The tool examines both past and current episodes, focusing on the most severe past episode and the most current episode. However, this tool does not rate symptom severity; it should only be used to assess presence or absence of symptomatology. This version of the K-SADS introduced screening questions, which, if negative, allowed skipping the remaining diagnostic probes. Furthermore, the K-SADS-E also includes “skip out” criteria when assessing other diagnostic disorders (ADHD, PTSD, etc.), allowing those that screen positive to immediately be interviewed for all of the symptoms regarding that diagnosis, and those that screened negative could “skip out” of being interviewed on the remaining symptoms. = WASH-U-KSADS = The WASH-U version of the K-SADS was written by Barbara Geller and colleagues in 1996. It is a modified version of the 1986 K-SADS. This version is like many other versions of the K-SADS in that it is semi-structured, administered by clinicians to both parent and child separately, and assesses present episodes. However, this version specifically expands the mania section in order to be more applicable to pre-pubertal mania. In particular, it queries presence/absence of rapid cycling. It also includes a section on multiple other DSM-IV diagnoses, and examines both present and lifetime symptoms as well as symptom onset and offset items. These modifications made this specific version particularly useful for phenomenology studies. = KSADS Mania Rating Scale (KMRS) and Depression Rating Scale (KDRS) = It also is possible to use the items in the mania and depression modules of some versions of the KSADS to get an interview-based rating of the severity of mood problems. The KMRS and KDRS use a 1 to 6 rating format (the same as in the WASH-U, -P, and PL-Plus versions). Adding up the items provides a measure of the total symptom burden. The KMRS assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available (missing data); scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/problematic. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both the child and the parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S). The KMRS is an alternative the Mania Rating Scale designed by Young et al. (frequently referred to as the YMRS). The YMRS is more well-known and widely used, but because it was written in 1978, it does not include all of the symptoms of mania from ICD-9 or ICD-10 (nor DSM-IV or DSM-5), as it predated them all. The YMRS was also designed for completion by nurses at the end of their eight-hour shift on an inpatient unit, observing adult patients. The KMRS has several advantages in comparison: It covers all the symptoms used in current versions of ICD and DSM, it was designed for use with children and teenagers, and it was written and validated as an interview. Studies have found excellent internal consistency and inter-rater reliability, as well as exceptionally high correlation with the YMRS. Similarly, the KDRS would be analogous to the Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised. The CDRS-R was also designed to be done as an interview, but the item content predates the current ICD and DSM and omits some important symptoms. The KDRS also shows strong reliability (internal consistency and inter-rater) and exceptionally high correlations with the KDRS.  Development and history  The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children, or K-SADS, was originally created as an adapted version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, a measure for adults. The K-SADS was written by Chambers, Puig-Antich, et al. in the late 1970s. The K-SADS was developed to promote earlier diagnosis of affective disorders and schizophrenia in children in a way that incorporates reports by both the child and parent and a “summary score” by the interviewer based on observations and teacher ratings. The first version of the K-SADS differed from other tests on children because it relied on answers to interview questions rather than observances during games and interactions. The 1990s led to the creation of different versions of the K-SADS for different purposes, such as ascertaining lifetime diagnoses (K-SADS-E) or focusing on current episodes (K-SADS-P). Impact The K-SADS is used to measure previous and current symptoms of affective, anxiety, psychotic, and disruptive behavior disorders. The K-SADS has become one of the most widely used diagnostic interviews in research, particular for projects focused on mood disorders. The K-SADS-PL has been written and translated into 16 different languages, including Korean, Hebrew, Turkish, Icelandic, and Persian. The K-SADS-PL is also available in several Indian dialects including Kannada, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. Limitations One limitation of the K-SADS is that it requires extensive training to give properly, including observation techniques, score calibration, and re-checks to test inter-rater reliability.

It is a white, water-soluble and hygroscopic, solid, commonly represented by the condensed structural formula H2NOSO3H, though it actually exists as a zwitterion and thus is more accurately represented as +H3NOSO3−. It is used as a reagent for the introduction of amine groups (-NH2), for the conversion of aldehydes into nitriles and alicyclic ketones into lactams (cyclic amides), and for the synthesis of variety of nitrogen-containing heterocycles.  Preparation  According to a laboratory procedure hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid can be prepared by treating hydroxylamine sulfate with fuming sulfuric acid (oleum). The industrial process is similar. :(NH3OH)2SO4 \\\\+ 2SO3 → 2H2NOSO3H + H2SO4 The sulfonation of hydroxylamine can also be effected with chlorosulfonic acid by a method first published in 1925 and refined for Organic Syntheses.  Structure  Analogous to sulfamic acid (H3N+SO3−) and as is the case generally for amino acids, HOSA exists in the solid state as a zwitterion: H3N+OSO3−. It resembles an ammonia molecule coordinate covalently bonded to a sulfate group.  Reactions  HOSA reacts under basic conditions as nucleophile and under neutral and acid conditions as electrophile. Reaktivität of Hydroxylamine-O-sulfonsäure als Elektrophil und als Nukleophil =Aminations= Synthesis of N-Aminopiperidin with HOSA It reacts with tertiary amines to trisubstituted hydrazinium salts and with pyridine to the 1-amino pyridinium salt. Synthesis of 1-Aminopyridin with HOSA From 1-aminopyridinium salts the photochemically active 1-N-iminopyridinium ylides are accessible by acylation. The photochemical rearrangement of the obtained 1-N-iminipyridinium ylides leads in high yields to 1H-1,2-diazepines Synthesis of 1,2-Diazepinen aus Iminopyridiniumyliden N-amination of 1H-benzotriazole with hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid yields a mixture of 1-aminobenzotriazole (major product) and 2-aminobenzotriazole (minor product). From 1-aminotriazole, benzyne is formed in an almost quantitative yield by oxidation with lead(IV) acetate, which rapidly dimerizes to biphenylene in good yields. Synthesis of Benzyne and Biphenylene from 1-Aminobenzotriazole Electron deficient heterocycles, such as tetrazole, can be N-aminated with hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid, while even more electron-deficient compounds, such as 5-nitrotetrazole, react only with stronger aminating agents such as O-tosylhydroxylamine or O- mesitylene sulfonylhydroxylamine to amino compounds, which were investigated as explosives. 1-Aminotetrazol und 2-Aminotetrazol durch Aminierung of Tetrazol with HOSA In the N-amination of the unsubstituted tetrazole, a mixture of 1-amino- and 2-aminotetrazole is obtained. Synthesis of Sulfiminen with HOSA Also sulfur compounds (such as thioethers) can be aminated with hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid to sulfinimines (isosteric with sulfoxides but far more unstable) or phosphorus compounds (such as triphenylphosphine) can be aminated to phosphine imides via the intermediate aminotriphenylphosphonium hydrogen sulfate. center The reaction of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid with metal salts of sulfinic acids in sodium acetate solution produces primary sulfonamides in very good yields. Synthesis of primären Sulfonamiden aus Sulfinaten Diimine can formed in situ from hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid respectively hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid hydroxylamine sulfate mixtures, which hydrogenates selectively conjugated multiple bonds.[20] = With carbonyl compounds = At room temperature and below, hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid reacts with ketones and aldehydes as a nucleophile to the corresponding oxime-O-sulfonic acids or their salts. The oxime-O-sulfonic acids of aldehydes react above room temperature upon elimination of sulfuric acid in high yields to nitriles. Reaktion of HOSA with Carbonylverbindungen Aliphatic ketones provide under similar conditions in very high yields oximes, arylalkyl ketones react in a Beckmann rearrangement to amides. When heated to reflux for several hours under acidic conditions (e.g., in the presence of concentrated formic acid) alicyclic ketones react to provide lactams in high yields. 2-Azacyclooctanon durch Reaktion of Cycloheptanon with HOSA Under basic conditions in the presence of primary amines, hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid forms with aldehydes and ketones (e.g. cyclohexanone) diaziridines, which can easily be oxidized to the more stable diazirines. 3,3-Pentamethylendiaziridin durch Reaktion of Cyclohexanon mit HOSA The reaction also provides substituted aziridines from simple aldehydes and ketones with high yield and diastereoselectivity. Synthesis of Diaziridinen with HOSA 1,2-Benzisoxazole is efficiently produced by nucleophilic attack of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid to the carbonyl group of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde followed by cyclization. Synthesis of 1,2-Benzisoxazol aus Salicylaldehyd und HOSA 1,2-Benzisoxazole is a structural element in the antipsychotic risperidone and paliperidone, as well as the anticonvulsant zonisamide. In a one-pot reaction, N-aryl[3,4-d]pyrazolopyrimidines are obtained in good yields from simple 4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-carboxaldehyde, N-Aryl-Pyrazolopyrimidine which can be used as purine analogs for a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. = Further reactions = The chemiluminescence of the system luminol/cobalt(II) chloride is dramatically enhanced by the addition of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid.

It contains copies of donations from seven kings—Ordoño II, Ordoño III, Ramiro III, Vermudo II, Alfonso V, Fernando I and Alfonso VI—and one countess, Sancha Muñiz. Each copy is preceded by an illustration of the donor. All but Ordoño II are shown bearing the original charter (a scroll with a large seal).

The illustrations, however, are anachronistic. The costume depicted is typical of the twelfth century, not the early tenth. Similarly, pendant seals did not become common in Iberia until the twelfth century. Each king is depicted crowned and seated on a throne, bearing a sceptre. The scrolls the donors hold bear their names and a confirmation of their donation.

The depiction of the countess differs from those of the kings in that she is bending her knees while a second figure lifts a sword ready to strike. In the iconography of the times, she is portrayed as a martyr because of her gift to the abbey.

Fowler (born March 5, 1998) is an American actor with cerebral palsy. He is most known for his roles in Labor Day and JJ DiMeo in the television series Speechless. Fowler has also had minor roles in Blue's Clues and Sesame Street. Early life The younger brother of actress Kelsey Fowler, he grew up in Barnegat Township, New Jersey. He grew up performing in local theater productions along with his sister. After his sister started taking roles on Broadway, Fowler thought he might like to advance his acting career as well. Career Micah D. Fowler started pursuing acting at the age of 5, which led him to roles on Blue's Clues and Sesame Street. He booked his role for Labor Day at age thirteen. For his most recent role, as \\"JJ DiMeo\\" on Speechless, he found out he booked the role on his eighteenth birthday. In an interview with People magazine, Fowler said it was the \\"best birthday present ever!\\" Regarding his role on Speechless, he said it is a challenge to play JJ. Although Fowler is able to speak, the JJ character does not speak, so Fowler has to compensate with dramatic facial expressions and body movements. It's said that Fowler's humor gets the show's biggest laughs. He said he sometimes just wants to blurt out what he is feeling or saying. Fowler and the character he portrays both have cerebral palsy, and he is one of few actors with a disability playing a character with a disability on primetime network television. Ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation When not performing, Fowler devotes his time as an ambassador for the Cerebral Palsy Foundation (CPF). After each episode of Speechless, the CPF's website posts content and short informational videos about cerebral palsy. Fowler encourages, \\"So the next time you watch Speechless, take 10 minutes to check out their post for the night.\\" Personal life When taking the role for Speechless, Fowler had to move from New Jersey to Los Angeles. To take the role, he missed much of his sled hockey season and most of his senior year. While Fowler had previously been somewhat averse to social media, after landing the role on Speechless, he joined both Instagram and Twitter in an effort to promote the show. Growing up he said he was a huge fan of movies and television. He said, \\"I couldn't help but notice the lack of characters dealing with disabilities.\\" He hopes to be in a Star Wars film or a Marvel movie.

The ConnectEd initiative is funded through Title IV Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which designates specific monies for the effective use of technology in schools. The 2016 National Education Technology Plan aligns with ConnectEd as a published action plan to meet these goals of technology integration and connectivity. The ConnectEd Initiative was announced by President Obama in June 2013 during a speech Mooresville, North Carolina as a plan to increase broadband Internet access in schools, to partner with private companies for affordable devices and innovation, and to redesign school curriculum to better meet the needs of the digital age. This initiative was a response to research done by Education SuperHighway, a nonprofit that evaluates school broadband speed, which showed that only 30% of school districts in the year 2013 had the Federal Communications Commission's minimum internet access goal of 100 Kilobits per second per student. To meet ConnectEd's goals of upgrading connectivity, training teachers, and encouraging private sector innovation, The United States Department of Education and the Alliance for Excellent Education partnered and created a guide for implementation called the Future Ready Schools framework.  Rationale  Under the Obama administration, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) created the National Broadband Plan (United States) (NBP) to increase economic competitiveness and foster in-demand digital social interaction access within the United States. This plan was a response to the growing digital divide by socioeconomic status. According to the American Community Survey in 2013, 90% of households that have at least one college- educated parent had internet access, compared to less than 50% of households that had at least one parent with less than a high school diploma had the internet. This lack of access to internet at home can impact ability to perform on assessments, complete online assignments, and apply for jobs. School districts with less resources also experience the digital divide. The 2013 EducationSuperHighway report stated school districts who are affluent were \\"twice as likely as moderate-income school districts and three times as likely as low-income school districts to meet the FCC's 100 kbps per student goal.\\"  Timeline  Shortly after Obama's 2013 speech unrolling the ConnectEd initiative, over 1,000 educators signed a petition to expand internet access in schools in November 2013. In November 2014, over 100 superintendents from the Digital Promise League of Innovation were invited to the White House by the Department of Education for the ConnectEd Superintendents Summit and pledge their commitment to enacting ConnectEd. The purpose of the summit was to share ideas about technology education and sign the Future Ready District Pledge. Any public school district can sign and commit to the Future Ready District Pledge to receive additional supports, guidance, and resources about how to transition into digital learning. In order to achieve the goals of the ConnectEd Initiative, the Alliance for Excellent Education, McGraw-Hill Education, AT&T;, and Metri Group collaborated to devise the Future Ready Framework to serve as a roadmap towards digital learning. This roadmap can be used by schools to transition into digital learning. The seven gears of the Framework include Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment, Use of Space and Time, Robust Infrastructure, Data and Privacy, Community Partnerships, Personalized Learning, and Budget and Resources. In April 2015, the ConnectEd Library Challenge was announced. This challenge urges public libraries to partner with local officials and school leaders so every child is able to own a library card. In conjunction with the ConnectEd Library Challenge, Obama also announced his e-Books Initiative in the same month. The e-Books Initiative calls for students ages 4–18 to access world-class digital library. In November 2015, superintendents met at regional summits to create plans using the free interactive planning dashboard, which included a district technology assessment, job-embedded opportunities for personalized learning, and technology policies and practices. The final goal was to use the Framework to make an action plan to bring home to their districts for implementation. Regional summits continued to be held in year 2016 with plans for regional summits to continue years into the future. Sample agendas [1] include creating plans for implementation at schools, creating a culture of \\"Future Ready Schools\\" within schools, districts, and communities, and share insights from current work. President Obama announced the ConnectEd goal \\"to provide 99 percent of American students with access to next-generation broadband in their classrooms and libraries by 2018.\\"  Funding  Funding for ConnectEd comes from the U.S. Government in conjunction with private companies such as Esri, Adobe Systems, Autodesk, and others who have provided up to $2 billion to give schools access to \\"devices, free software, teacher professional development, and home wireless connectivity.\\" From 2014-2016, the Federal Communications Commission's E-Rate program has funded $2 billion to increase high-speed connectivity. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) also provides rural schools with an additional $10 million for distance learning. Districts who have signed the \\"Future Ready District Pledge\\" have the flexibility in Title I, II, and III funds through the Every Student Succeeds Act to spend towards meeting the ConnectEd goals.  Overview  = Upgrading Connectivity = The ConnectEd initiative aims to increase internet connectivity in schools, including high- speed, wired or wireless internet, and broadband capabilities. Increasing bandwidth within schools is a priority of the ConnectEd initiative because as of 2016, 23% of schools do not have enough bandwidth to meet their digital learning needs. This lack of available, sufficient bandwidth has also been called The Connectivity Gap. Furthermore, MDR's State of K-12 Report in 2015 notes that 99% of school district's don’t have the bandwidth capabilities that will be crucial over the next five years. In order to improve school connectivity, schools must meet three prerequisite goals: have access to fiber optic connections, have affordable bandwidth, and have classrooms capable of a robust Wi-Fi connection. The US Department of Education suggests that schools have of minimum connectivity speed of 100 Mbit/s with a speed of 1 Gbit/s per 1000 students. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, has aided in building technology infrastructure in underserved areas and rural communities throughout the United States; ConnectEd builds on these efforts, focusing especially on rural areas. President Barack Obama stated in speech in Durham, Oklahoma, \\"while high-speed Internet access is a given, is assumed for millions of Americans, it's still out of reach for too many people, especially in low income and rural communities.\\" In order to encourage investment in rural broadband, Obama's Administration has also continue to support the FCC's Universal Service Fund (USF), which has invested over $25 billion in funding since 2008. President Obama has asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to leverage the existing E-Rate program and increase the current E-Rate funding cap, as well as use the expertise of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to deliver this connectivity to states, districts, and schools. = Training Teachers = In order to improve student outcomes, the ConnectEd initiative pairs the Department of Education with states and school districts to create funding plans through Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for technology professional development. The goal of this professional development is to keep teachers on track with current technological demands. Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act funds also pay for professional development on computer-based assessmentcomputer-based assessments. In using computer-based assessments, teachers should be able to have more immediate feedback on student learning. The U.S. Department of Education and the Office of Educational Technology created a Professional Learning Toolkit called Future Ready Schools: Empowering Educators Through Professional Learning to assess district readiness for technological change. This toolkit contains five steps to build capacity in educator practice with the hopes of increasing student outcomes. The first step in the toolkit recommends that school districts set up district leadership team and collect pre-existing technology plans. Schools districts must then devise S.M.A.R.T. goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely) focused on professional learning and refine them using the Professional Learning Strategies Self-Assessment Tool created by the Toolkit. Once refined, school districts can implement an action plan for professional learning. Finally, school districts assess the effectiveness of their professional learning plan for staff and students based on evidence such as satisfaction of participants, the knowledge they gain, and whether student outcomes increase or not. thumbThe Seven Gears of Future Ready Schools Framework With the support of the U.S. Department of Education, the Alliance for Excellent Education created the free, online Future Ready Schools Framework and the Future Ready Schools Interactive Planning Dashboard. District leadership teams use the Interactive Planning Dashboard to plan technology use and assess progress over time, whereas the Future Ready Schools Framework \\"provides the roadmap for a successful digital transformation.\\" There are 7 Gears in the Future Ready Schools Framework: * Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment * Personalized Professional Learning * Robust Infrastructure * Data and Privacy * Community Partnerships * Budget and Resources * Use of Space and Time\\" These free, online tools are for teachers and district leaders to begin their path into becoming a Future Ready School as well as to continue professional development and to improve their current work in ConnectEd. In addition to these professional development tools, in- person professional development through Future Ready Schools is available in regional summits. These regional summits are free of charge for district leadership teams. Another avenue for districts to become \\"Future Ready Schools\\" is by garnering support from the International Center for Leadership in Education (which is a Future Ready Schools Coalition Partner). This group will help schools integrate technology and utilize digital learning in classroom through building a professional learning plans, supporting teachers in digital literacy, increasing 1:1 initiatives, and personalizing student learning. = Encouraging Private Sector Innovation = ConnectEd calls on the private sector to provide devices and/or professional development on technology use at a free or discounted rate for schools to be able to meet the ConnectEd initiative with little extra cost. The charge from ConnectEd is have quality devices in schools as well as price-competitive educational software. As such, private sectors are encouraged to supply devices and software for schools at free to low-cost, with choice of the local district educators for type of devices. These new technologies allow for students to be engaged in digital learning in the classroom. EdX and Coursera have committed to provide free virtual professional development, with specifically EdX allowing free coursework from top universities available to educators. \\"Participating hardware, software, wireless and professional development companies include: * Adobe Systems, has begun providing more than $300 million worth of free software to teachers and students, including Photoshop and Premiere Elements for creative projects; Presenter and Captivate to amplify e-learning; EchoSign for school workflow; and a range of teacher training resources * Apple Inc., has donated $100 million in iPads, MacBooks, and other products, along with content and professional development tools to enrich learning in disadvantaged U.S. schools * AT&T;, has donated $100 million to give 50,000 middle and high school students in Title I districts free Internet connectivity for educational devices over their wireless network for three years * Autodesk, is making its 3D design program \\"Design the Future\\" available for free in every secondary school in the U.S. — more than $250 million in value * Coursera, which is providing no-cost online professional development at every school district over the next two years, including opportunities for teachers to earn Coursera's completion certificates that may be used for continuing education credits * edX, is providing all students with free access to online Advanced Placement-level courses offered through edX by partner institutions like UC Berkeley, MIT, and Georgetown in addition to more than 40 other courses and modules * Esri, is providing $1 billion worth of free access to ArcGIS Online Organization accounts – the same Geographic Information Systems mapping technology used by government and business – to every K-12 school in America to allow students to map and analyze data * Microsoft, has launched a substantial affordability program open to all U.S. public schools by deeply discounting the price of its Windows operating system, which will decrease the price of Windows-based devices * O'Reilly Media, which is partnering with Safari Books Online to make more than $100 million in educational content and tools available for free to every school in the U.S. * Prezi, is providing $100 million in Edu Pro licenses for high schools and all educators across America * The Sprint Corporation will provide one million high-school students who do not have the Internet at home with new digital devices paired with four years of mobile broadband connectivity. This commitment builds on the company's first ConnectED commitment, made in 2014, to connect 50,000 K-12 students nationwide with mobile broadband wireless service. * Verizon, which announced a multi-year program to support ConnectED through up to $100 million in cash and in-kind commitments\\"  Implications  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has committed to providing funding for the ConnectEd initiative. The government estimated that the cost of this initiative would fall between $4 and $6 billion, which would not be funded by tax dollars. However, this funding may come from a rise in the universal service fund (USF), which the FCC has complete control in determining without congress approval. The USF may be increased on cell phone bills in order to pay for this initiative through the FCC's E-rate program. The American Enterprise Institute has questioned whether the private company partners in the ConnectEd initiative are taking advantage of additional sales, market shares, or publicity rather than focusing on education policy. Through commitments to funding or providing discounts and/or free devices and software, companies are allowed free advertising as well as push for their products over others. As such, the private interests of these companies may overshadow the public interest of education. Kathryn Drohman from the University of Washington Tacoma has questioned the sustainability of technology tools in schools since they can quickly become obsolete, can be costly to attain and maintain, can be implemented in a variety of ways by individual teachers. Austan Goolsbee, Obama's first-term chief economic advisor conducted a study in California which showed that students showed in gains with more computer access. Additionally, a study of ninth graders conducted in 2014 in Portugal found that students who had more internet time had lower learning achievement scores. The Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) has cited several challenges for school districts in meeting ConnectEd's goals: high costs, growth level capacity, reliability of network service, increased digital needs, infrastructure maintenance, wireless connectivity, and addressing off- campus device needs.

It was formally incorporated into the party in 2015.  History  = Foundation and early years = According to The Spinoff, Young NZ First was founded in 2010. However, the Dominion Post reported in 2009 on a youth branch of NZ First being created by Tim Manu, a NZ First member, city councillor, and part-time music teacher. Manu said he had been frustrated while a student to see National and Labour groups on campus but no group for NZ First. It appears that the formation of Young NZ First was driven by the party's leader, Winston Peters. Initial members were reportedly generally left-wing, which contrasted to NZ First's overall centrism. Early membership figures are not clear; a former member reports around a dozen members, while another stated that as of 2012 it had 60 members and multiple branches. The presence of a youth wing allowed NZ First to counteract its image of a party of older members, such as John Key's comments that NZ First supporters were \\"dying out\\". The nascent youth wing had influence over the main party during the 2011 election campaign, with one member taking roles such as being on electoral committees, a campaign manager for a candidate, and an informal media adviser. The youth wing apparently influenced the party to promise to forgive student debt to graduates who remained in New Zealand for five years, and to reduce use of anti-immigration and \\"race-baiting rhetoric\\" that had been used in previous campaigns. A key early figure in the organisation was Curwen Rolinson, who was elected to the party's board of directors at age 20, became the public face of Young NZ First, and had a close relationship with the party's leader, Winston Peters. However, in 2015, Rolinson (aged 25) resigned, having developed a fractious relationship with the party's leadership. Rolinson continues to write a blog called \\"NZ First Youth\\" and is associated with NZ First members but is not connected with the party or the youth wing. = Incorporation into party structure = Young New Zealand First was formally incorporated into the NZ First party structure in 2015. This incorporation was the subject of controversy within the party. Young NZ First had repeatedly attempted to formalise its relationship with the party without success. This led to problems when Rolinson was cited by media as being the leader of the NZ First youth wing, despite such a thing not officially existing. In 2015, Winston Peters released a statement that the NZ First youth wing did not exist and that Rolinson had been “told countless times never to call himself the president or leader of a youth wing.” Despite this, Young New Zealand First formally became part of the party, with a role set by the party's constitution, after a remit passed at the party's 2015 convention. Today, New Zealand First has a permanent position on its board assigned to be filled by a member of Young NZ First. However, Young New Zealand First members who join the party itself are a separate membership category. Board member Julie Carr said in 2019 that this is \\"because they are inexperienced with political matters and need to be guided and mentored in their role”.  Leadership  As of August 2020, the leader of Young New Zealand First was Jay McLaren-Harris.  Policies and actions  = Marriage equality = While the NZ First party opposed the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 and instead wanted a national referendum on same- sex marriage, Young NZ First signed a joint statement in support of the bill. The decision to do so caused tension in the party and led to Peters and the party leadership becoming increasingly wary of Young NZ First. = Restricting voting rights for immigrants = At the NZ First party conference in 2018, Young NZ First put forward a remit that would restrict voting rights of immigrants; instead of gaining the right to vote after a year of living in New Zealand, immigrants would need to be a \\"permanent resident\\" as defined in the Immigration Act. NZ First party members voted in favour of the remit. = Testing of drugs = Young NZ First opposed NZ First's policy around drug testing at festivals. The Labour and Green parties had proposed legalising testing of drugs at festivals and other events, but New Zealand First opposed the legislation with leader Winston Peters saying \\"We at New Zealand First say it's not safe, don't do it. If you want to live, then stick to things that are safe\\". Without NZ First's support the legislation could not progress. By contrast, Young NZ First said that testing would help save lives. At NZ First's annual conference in October 2019, Young NZ First's chair William Woodward put up a remit calling for the party to reevaluate its policy. Prior to the conference, Peters said he was confident that \\"a significant majority\\" of NZ First backed its current position, but NZ First's members voted for the party to reconsider the issue. The party announced it would do so before the upcoming summer festivals, but this did not occur; as of April 2020 the party has made no further comments on the issue either way.  Controversies  In 2016, a group of Young NZ First members chanted “Build the Wall” at Ricardo Menéndez March, a Young Greens member of Mexican descent, during an AUSA Back Benches political event. Young NZ First later apologised to him. Alt-right groups have expressed a desire to \\"influence NZFirst both directly and through Young NZFirst\\".

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a pale greenish-cream coloured flower with dark purple clubs and red patches on the petals. Description Caladenia atroclavia is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf. The leaf is linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and has irregular red blotches near its base. There is usually only one flower on a wiry, hairy spike high. The flower is pale greenish-cream with red blotches on the petals and is reported to smell like an overheated electric motor. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, about wide, linear to narrow lance-shaped near the base then narrowing to about . The lower part of the dorsal sepal has a reddish stripe in its centre and ends with a thick, dark reddish-purple glandular tip. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, linear to lance-shaped and have a glandular end like the one on the dorsal sepal. The petals are long, about wide, linear to lance shaped with a red line along their centre. The petals and sepals spread widely near their bases but have drooping ends. The labellum is about long and wide and narrow egg-shaped when flattened. It is green and erect in the lower part, then dark maroon and curved nearer the end. There are 6 to 8 linear-shaped teeth along the edges, the longest about but decreasing in size towards the end. There are four rows of dark maroon calli in the centre of the labellum, the longest ones flat-topped and long. The column is long and curved with broad wings. Flowering occurs in October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia atroclavia was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones and Mark Clements and the description was published in Austrobaileya. The type specimen was collected near Wyberba in the Darling Downs district. The specific epithet (atroclavia) refers to the prominent dark-coloured ends of the sepals. Distribution and habitat This caladenia grows in well-drained gravel derived from granite in woodland and swampy areas. Only four populations with a total of about 70 plants are known, occurring in the Girraween National Park and in the Wyberba area. Conservation Caladenia atroclavia is classified as \\"Endangered\\" under the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act and the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threat to its survival is the feral pig Sus scrofa. Ecology Research at the University of Southern Queensland has shown that the mycorrhizal fungus associated with this species of orchid belongs to the Sebacinaceae complex.

She appears in four out of the five I Spit on Your Grave films. She is a vigilante in the 1978 original film, its 2019 sequel Deja Vu, the 2010 remake and the sequel to the 2010 film I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine. In the films she seeks vengeance against her tormentors.  Appearances  =Original timeline= In the 1978 film, Jennifer is an aspiring writer from New York vacationing in a cabin in the woods to focus on writing her novel. She is then assaulted by a group of local rednecks, Johnny Stillman, Matthew Duncan, Andy Chirensky, and Stanley Woods who rape her, destroy her manuscript and leave her for dead. She then becomes a vigilante, hunting down her tormentors, and killing them one by one. In 2019, Camille Keaton reprised her role as Jennifer in I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu, the sequel to the original film and timeline. Decades after the events of the original film, Jennifer published a successful autobiography that recounts the assaults against her and her revenge; this infuriates the family members of the men that she killed, Becky Stillman (Johnny's wife), Beady Eyes Duncan (Matthew's grandmother), Herman (Matthew's father), Henry Stillman (Johnny's father), Millie Stillman (Johnny's mother), Scotty Chirensky (Andy's cousin), and Kevin Woods (Stanley's brother) and causes them to seek retribution of their own. They slit her throat and decapitate her, but her daughter Christy then meets revenge with revenge. It is also revealed that, despite Jennifer's effort of concealing Christy's father's identity from her, Christy knew that he was one of her mother's rapists due to the time of conception, and secretly identified that Johnny, a gas station manager and leader of the rapist group, was her biological father. =Remake timeline=  Development  = Casting = In an interview, Zarchi stated that \\"I put ads in two industry magazines, weekly magazines in New York, in the spring of 1976.

I remember auditioning a few thousand men and maybe 600 women and as soon as I saw Camille's still, her black-and-white still, I felt there was something there.

Clover stated that \\"Jennifer takes the revenge she does not for deep- seated psychological reasons but because it is the punishment that fits the crime; there are no extenuating circumstances; the law is not involved, nor are legal questions raised; and there is no concern whatever, not even at the level of lip service, with moral and ethical issues.\\" Luke Bonanno of DVDizzy.com praised Camille Keaton's performance saying \\"As the thin, long- haired aspiring novelist turned retributory badass, Ms. Keaton is unquestionably the best thing about I Spit and her performance stands out by more than just an easy process of elimination.\\" Michael Jacobson said \\"I think Camille Keaton gives an astoundingly powerful performance in this movie. Some might condemn her for her career short-sightedness in making such a picture, but I prefer to praise her for her courage. A lot is asked of her, and a lot rides on her ability to sell some really horrid sequences.\\" Roger Ebert criticized the film and the character saying that \\"If I rape you, I have committed a crime. If you kill me, you have committed another one. The ideal outcome would be two people unharmed in the first place. The necessity of revenge is embedded in the darker places of our minds, and most hate speech is driven by 'wrongs' invented in unbalanced minds. No one who commits a hate crime ever thinks his victim is innocent.\\"  References   External links  * * Jennifer Hills (remake timeline) at Horror Film (wiki) * Jennifer Hills (original) and Angela Jitrenka at Villains (wiki) Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Fictional stalkers Category:Fictional torturers Category:Fictional writers Category:Fictional cannabis users Category:Film characters introduced in 1978 Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Fictional lynching victims Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Female horror film characters Category:I Spit on Your Grave ","title":"Jennifer Hills"},{"id":"51842729","text":"Anthony Laron Walker Jr. (born August 8, 1995) is an American football linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Northwestern and was drafted by the Colts in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft. College career Walker first saw action in his redshirt freshman season when Collin Ellis went down with a series of injuries. In his first career game, Walker returned an interception for a touchdown against Penn State that capped a Northwestern win. In his first full season as a starter, Walker found success as he recorded 122 tackles to lead the team and 20.5 tackles for loss which was fourth in the nation. For his performance that season, Walker received All-American recognition from the AP and Sports Illustrated as well as Consensus First-Team All Big 10 honors. On November 29, 2016, Walker was named Second Team All-Big Ten. Professional career =2017= The Indianapolis Colts selected Walker in the fifth round (161st overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. Walker was the 20th linebacker drafted in 2017. On May 11, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts signed Walker to a four-year, $2.66 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $265,413. Walker missed organized team activities due to Northwestern's quarters schedule and the league's rules on rookies being unable to join their team until their school's final semester had concluded. Upon entering training camp, Walker competed to be a starting inside linebacker against Sean Spence, Antonio Morrison, Jon Bostic, and Edwin Jackson. Head coach Chuck Pagano named Walker a backup inside linebacker to begin the regular season, behind Jon Bostic and Antonio Morrison. He made his professional regular season debut in the Indianapolis Colts' season-opener at the Los Angeles Rams, but exited in the second quarter of their 46–9 loss after sustaining a hamstring injury. His hamstring injury sidelined him for the next three games (Weeks 2–4). In Week 5, he aggravated his hamstring injury during the third quarter of a 26–23 win against the San Francisco 49ers and was inactive for the next three games (Weeks 6–8). On December 29, 2017, Walker earned his first start after Jon Bostic was ruled inactive due to an injury. He collected a season-high nine combined tackles in the Colts' 23–16 loss at the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16. On December 31, 2017, the Indianapolis Colts fired head coach Chuck Pagano after the Colts finished 4–12 in 2017. He finished his rookie season in 2017 with 22 combined tackles (11 solo) in ten games and two starts. =2018= On February 11, 2018, the Indianapolis Colts hired former Philadelphia Eagles' offensive coordinator Frank Reich as their new head coach. Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus opted to change the base 3-4 defense and implemented a base 4-3 defense. Walker entered training camp slated as the starting middle linebacker, but saw competition from Najee Goode. On July 31, 2018, it was reported that Walker had injured his groin in the first week of training camp and was sidelined for the remainder of training camp and all four preseason games. Head coach Frank Reich named Walker the starting middle linebacker to start the regular season in 2018, alongside outside linebackers Najee Goode and rookie Darius Leonard. On September 23, 2018, Walker recorded nine combined tackles and made his first career interception off a pass by Eagles' quarterback Carson Wentz during a 20–16 loss at the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 2. =2019= In Week 13 against the Tennessee Titans, Walker recorded a team high 12 tackles and forced a fumble on running back Derrick Henry on the first play of the game which was recovered by teammate Malik Hooker in the 31–17 loss. In Week 16 against the Carolina Panthers, Walker recorded 10 tackles, sacked rookie quarterback Will Grier once, and intercepted a pass thrown by Grier during the 38–6 win. In Week 17 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Walker recorded a team high 16 tackles during the 38–20 loss. =2020= In Week 5 against the Cleveland Browns, Walker recorded his first interception off a pass thrown by Baker Mayfield during the 32–23 loss.

Raby Moshfegh Hamadani () (1912-2009), was a Jewish Iranian political journalist and writer. Early life and education Hamadani was born in Hamadan, Iran, in April 1912. His father Davood Kohan, son of Yitzak, was a merchant in this ancient city. Raby’s grandfather Yitzak travelled to Jerusalem three times on foot to visit the sacred city, receiving the title of Haji Yitzak. Hamadani attended the Alliance Israelite School in Hamadan, where he became fluent in French. During his childhood and teen-age years, as reported in his published memoirs Memoirs of Half a Century in Journalism (خاطرات نيم قرن روزنامه نكارى), \\"Khaterate Neem Gharn Rooznameh Neghari\\", R. Moshfegh Hamadani, Book World Publishers, Los Angeles, 7/1991 (in Persian) he experienced the bitter taste of antisemitism . But the overthrow of the corrupt Qajar dynasty by Reza Shah in 1925 had infused a new wave of education, progress and modernization throughout the country.Fifty Five (بنجإه و بنج), \\"Panjaho Panj\\", Ali Dashti , Nima Verlag Publishers, 1/2003 (in Persian) Growing up in this atmosphere of hope, Hamadani became convinced that following the path of democracy and political freedom was the only means to achieve prosperity and that Iran needed the energetic infusion of a talented and well educated younger generation to reestablish her place among the great nations of the Middle East. In 1931, at the age of 17, Hamadani graduated from high school and decided to play a role in this new wave of modernization and freedom. He left his family and traveled to Tehran to continue his studies. He enrolled in the Department of Philosophy and Educational Sciences of the University of Tehran, where he graduated in 1939 while teaching French as a second language at the prestigious Dar-ol-Fonun دارالفنون high school of Tehran. Career Hamadani took the first of many steps on the path of journalism and authorship, translating Schopenhauer’s work “The Philosophy of Love” into Persian. His literary work continued in parallel with his employment first as a teacher of French language and literature and later as an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he was first appointed as French translator and shortly promoted to Director of the Pars News Agency, overseeing the translation of international news for the Iranian press. He continued contributing to Persian literature by translating world-famous masterpieces by Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Flaubert, Schopenhauer, Lockhart and John Dewey, among others, exposing Iranian readers to such western literature works of art as well as modern concepts in education and psychology. He was a prolific writer, authoring several works of fiction that first appeared in weekly instalments in renowned magazines of that era, such as Omide Iran أميد أايران, Teherane Mossawar تهران مصور and others. These writings were later published as stand-alone books (see Bibliography below) and illustrated the frustrations and tribulations of a young and well educated generation of Iranians confronted by the chaotic socio-political changes caused by the rapid modernization of the Iranian society at the time. His books quickly turned into best sellers and paved the way for his subsequent career as a well-known author, journalist and translator. During the Second World War, Hamadani was appointed editor in chief of Keyhan كيهإن the highly circulated and most popular daily newspaper distributed nationally throughout Iran. In his editorials, he embraced and supported the political platform of Mohammad Mossadegh and the National Front of Iran. In 1949, after a few years serving in the capacity of Keyhan’s editor-in-chief, he founded the weekly magazine Kavian كأؤيإن (a politically oriented publication with a distinctly secular and nationalistic voice) and became one of Mossadegh's ardent supporters in the latter's plan to nationalize Iran's oil industry (see Abadan Crisis). He expanded Kavian 's activities to include a printing press capable of color printing the cover pages of Kavian, a novel and unique capability that increased the weekly magazine's popularity and circulation. He also founded a publishing company and bookstore, Bongah Matbouati Safialishah بنكاه مطبوعاتى صفيعليشاه to publish his own as well as other literary works. In 1951 he was invited by President Harry Truman, together with a group of Iranian intellectuals, businessmen and influential journalists, to visit the United States in conjunction with the \\"International Leadership\\" program implemented by Truman's administration. Hamadani accompanied Dr. Mossadegh during his visit to the United Nations where the latter successfully defended Iran's claims against the Anglo Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, later renamed British Petroleum) and presented the Iranian government's position in regards to the oil nationalization platform of the National Front.Famous Contemporary Iranians (نامداران معاصر ايران)\\" Namdaran-e Moaasser-e Iran\\", M. Alamooti, Book Press, London, 1999, Vol. 2, pages 272-279 (in Persian) Although the international court at Hague ruled in favor of Iran, President Eisenhower's administration foreign policy was persuaded, by the British government's claims of Mossadegh's collusion with the Communist party of Iran (Hezb Tudeh حزب توده) and the potential danger of Iran falling into the Soviet sphere of influence, to orchestrate the overthrow of Mossadegh government by a military coup 1953 Iranian coup d'état with the tacit agreement of Mohammad Reza Shah. Hamadani's stance against the monarchy and in support of Mossadegh would cost him dearly: after the CIA-led coup that overthrew Mossadegh,Esther's Children, A Portrait of Iranian Jews, Houman Sarshar, page 271 Kavian 's offices and printing presses were looted and burned. Mossadegh, a number of his cabinet members and all other journalists and politicians that supported him were arrested. Some were accused of conspiring with the Communist Party of Iran (Hezb Tudeh حزب توده) to overthrow the constitutional monarchy system and declare a republic. They were tried in military courts and executed. Others, like Hamadani were imprisoned. Mossadegh was tried and exiled to his native city of Ahmadabad. Hamadani was eventually banished from Iran. He left his family behind, leaving his printing and publishing businesses to be managed by his brothers. For the next 50 years, he lived in exile in Rome, Italy, and Los Angeles, California, where he continued his literary activities by translating various masterpieces from French, English, and Italian into Persian. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979 resulting in the immigration of his extended family to the United States, he also left Italy to join them in Los Angeles, and continued to publish numerous articles, books and translations. A documentary film about his life was produced by the Center for Iranian Jewish Oral History and is available from the Library of Congress.Moshfegh Hamedani, Library of Congress, https://lccn.loc.gov/2004448578 Hamadani passed away in Los Angeles on 2 October 2009. Bibliography and Publications In addition to the hundreds of articles, short stories and sociopolitical editorials published by Hamadani over the course of his fifty-year career in journalism, his collected writings and translations number well over fifty book titles published in Iran and abroad.

Isler is an American astrophysicist and educator and an active advocate for diversity in STEM. After She conducts research on blazars (hyperactive supermassive black holes) and examines the jet streams emanating from them. She is currently an Assistant professor of Astrophysics at Dartmouth College. She completed a PhD in Astrophysics at Yale in 2014, becoming the first African-American woman to do so. Early life and education = Personal Life = Isler was raised in Niagara Falls, New York and then later Virginia Beach, Virginia and has a sister. For her birthday one year, her sister got her a telescope, which she would use to look at the stars. Her interest in astronomy began when she 12 years old, and began to study for a professional career in science. Isler's father left the family shortly before she left for college, sparking financial turmoil that threatened to cut her studies short. = Undergraduate Education = Since her undergraduate institution did not offer an astronomy degree, Isler decided to get a degree in physics. During her time as an undergrad, she was able to have multiple internships and summer research projects related to astronomy. She graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor's of Science degree from Norfolk State University's Dozoretz National Institute for Mathematics and Applied Sciences (DNIMAS), \\"...a program aimed at cultivating minority scientists who want to complete graduate-level work.\\" = Master's Research and Education = After obtaining her B.S., Isler went on to first earn a Master's of Arts (M.A.) in Physics at Fisk University under the tutelage of Kevin Stassun, and later a Master's of Science (M.S.) in Physics from Yale University. She became one of the first three-student members of the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to- Ph.D. Bridge Program, a program designed to increase the number of women and under-represented minorities with advanced STEM degrees. Through this program, students obtain a masters degree from Fisk University, and then go onto Vanderbilt for their PhD, though Isler decided to go to Yale for her PhD. = Doctoral Research and Education = In 2014, Isler obtained her PhD from Yale University in Astronomy where she worked with her doctoral studies in astrophysics, researching blazars. She became the first African-American woman to receive a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Yale. In an NPR interview, she recalled an exchange with one of her classmates during her first year at Yale. \\"So there are plates everywhere,\\" she recalls. \\"And all of a sudden, [a white male student] in my class hands me a pile of his dirty plates...and says, 'Here, now go and do what you're really here to do.'\\" In 2014, Isler published her doctoral dissertation, In Like a Lamb, Out Like a Lion: Probing the Disk- Jet Connection in Fermi Gamma-Ray Bright Blazars, which earned the Roger Doxsey Dissertation Prize from the American Astronomical Society. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she cited her role models as Dr. Mae Jamison, Dr. Beth Brown, and her mother.

Isler states that her research, > \\"...focuses on understanding how Nature does particle acceleration. I use > blazars –supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies that > “spin up” jets of particles moving at nearly the speed of light – as my > laboratory. By obtaining observations across the electromagnetic spectrum: > from radio, optical and all the way through to gamma-rays, I piece together > how and why these black holes are able to create such efficient particle > accelerators and, by extension, understand the Universe a tiny bit better. > I’m also very interested in and active about creating more equitable STEM > spaces for scholars of color broadly, and particularly, for women of color\\". =STEM advocacy=  VanguardSTEM  In 2015, Isler founded Vanguard: Conversations with Women of Color in STEM (VanguardSTEM). VanguardSTEM is a signature initiative of The STEM en Route to Change (SeRCH Foundation, Inc.). It is, \\"a live, monthly web-series featuring a rotating panel of women of color in STEM discussing a wide variety of topics including their research interests, wisdom, advice, tips, tricks and commentary on current events\\". The webinar's purpose is too, \\"...create conversations between emerging and established women of color in STEM, where we can celebrate an affirm our identities and STEM interests in a safe space\\". Isler moderates and hosts the live web-series, with input from the viewers via social media. Along with Isler, the webinar is supported by a number of other female scientists.  The SeRCH Foundation, Inc.

Boring would later come to be known as a pioneer after settling the town of Boring, Oregon in 1874, which took its namesake after him. Biography =Early life= Boring was born in Greenfield, Illinois on February 26, 1841. His mother was originally from Tennessee, and his father was from Maryland. He had one elder brother, George Boring (1838–1916), who was also a pioneer and settler of the town of Clarence, Missouri. Boring enlisted as a Union soldier during the American Civil War with the 33rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, beginning in 1861 under Bvt. Major General Charles Edward Hovey and Colonel Charles E. Lippincott. He was a member of the battalion that distinguished itself in the fall of Vicksburg in 1863, during which 11 of its 32 members died in battle. Boring sustained near-life-threatening injuries to his face and throat in the Siege of Vicksburg, which led to his discharge. The severity of the scars he received from his battle injuries would lead him to wear a beard for the remainder of his life. After his discharge, Boring returned to Greenfield, where he worked on his mother's farm. On December 11, 1867, Boring married Sarah Elizabeth Wilder in Greene County, Illinois. =Settlement of Boring, Oregon= In the early 1870s, president Ulysses S. Grant began offering incentives to homesteaders in the Western United States, which attracted William Boring; he and his wife Sarah left Illinois for San Francisco, California, and then traveled north to Portland, Oregon. William's elder half- brother, Joseph (b. 1829), who had traveled across the Oregon Trail in 1853, had already settled there and been living in the area for nearly two decades. William and Sarah joined Joseph at his home in 1874, twelve miles east of Portland. There, William and Sarah settled on of land. They gave birth to two children: Elsie in October 1875, who only lived for nine days; and Orville, born in 1879. The settlement occupied by the Boring family came to be known as Boring, Oregon after William donated land for a schoolhouse to be built in 1883, after which the community was granted the name \\"Boring.\\" By the turn of the twentieth century, the town had become a thriving logging community, and the construction of an interurban railroad to the town by the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company brought further residents and business. =Later life and death= According to the 1910 U.S. census, William (then aged 69) and Sarah (then aged 65) shared their home with son Orville, his wife, Lucy, and the couple's three-year-old son, Lester. Also living in the home was Thomas Field, a hired handyman from Minnesota, and Robert Bishop, a boarder from Maine. Boring was widowed after Sarah's death on February 12, 1922. He relocated to Portland sometime between 1923 and 1930, moving into the home of close friends Lester and Emma Armstrong. Boring died in Portland in 1931 at age 91, after an undisclosed eight-month illness.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed October 2, 2016 tributary to the Fall River. The river is a complex of spring-fed lakes and waterways originating in Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park in north-eastern Shasta County in northern California. From the Fall River, its waters continue to the Pit River and then the Sacramento River to the Pacific Ocean. History The Tule River sources in Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park, the ancestral homeland of a band of the Pit River Indians known as the Achomawi (also spelled Ajumawi, Achumawi, and Ahjumawi) whose name translates to \\"where the waters come together\\". The Achomawi are one of eleven bands of the Pit River Tribe of native peoples. The park lands were deeded to the state in 1975 by Ivy Horr, whose family logged and raised cattle in the area after they bought it in 1944. The Tule River is named for a common bulrush or cattail known as \\"tule\\". Ecology and conservation The Fall River Conservancy and the Fall River Resource Conservation District both work to restore the Fall River and its tributary, the Tule River. The lake complex and marshlands are an important stopover on the Pacific Flyway for Canada and snow geese as well as American white pelicans, and blue-winged teals. Other bird species include Lewis’s woodpeckers, northern pygmy owls, bald eagles and a large population of ospreys which nest in juniper trees, a situation unique to the area. Black- tailed deer and coyote (Canis latrans) frequent the grasslands. Non-native muskrats can be seen in the marshes and water’s edges. The indigenous Shasta crayfish is considered endangered by state and federal agencies. Only three inches long at maturity, Shasta crayfish numbers have diminished since the introduction of non-native crayfish species. Big Lake and Horr Pond are used primarily for waterfowl hunting and supports a warm water fishery year round and a trout fishery during the general trout season. In addition sportfisherman angle for non-native largemouth black bass Micropterus salmoides, and brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus). The watershed also hosts Sacramento suckers (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis) and self-sustaining populations of native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta). McArthur Swamp is a 7,400-acre area of reclaimed wetlands and open water north of the town of McArthur and south of Big Lake and the Tule River. It provides valuable waterfowl habitat on the Pacific Flyway and is also grazed. PG&E; proposes to donate McArthur Swamp and the nearby parcel acquired by a land trade with State Parks (see Lake Britton) to the Fall River Resource Conservation District, which is to manage it subject to a strict easement. Watershed and course The Tule River and lakes complex drains over 11,000 acres and is almost more a series of lakes than river. Ahjumavi Lava Springs is the source in northern Big Lake, from which waters flow southwest into Horr Pond and thence to the Fall River, after picking up flows from Ja She Creek and Little Tule River. The Little Tule River flows originate as Lava Creek then Eastman Lake before the Little Tule River confluence with the Tule River. The lava springs feeding the Big Lake Complex, the headwaters of the Tule River, are the source of 75% of the water in the Fall River and supply about 85% of the flow of the Pit River during the summer months.

Brownstein, Richard G. Mills, Isaac S. Kohane (December, 2010): Does Collocation Inform the Impact of Collaboration?Paul A. David, Oxford Internet Institute (Aug 2004): Towards a cyberinfrastructure for enhanced scientific collaboration: providing its ‘soft’ foundations may be the hardest part This usually entails use of increasingly popular cyberinfrastructure, such as emails, instant messaging and document sharing platforms to reduce the limitations of the users trying to work together from remote locations by overcoming physical barriers of geolocation (using cyberinfrastructure) and also to some extent, depending on the application used, the effects of working together in person. For example, a caller software that can be used to bring all collaborators into a single call-in for easier dissemination of ideas. Goals One of the major goals for distributed collaboration is to facilitate use of shared resources and communication.V Bellotti, S Bly (1996): Walking away from the desktop computer: distributed collaboration and mobility in a product design team There is a need to enable some sort of interaction which may involve exchange of gestures and body language information at an informal level which is usually unavailable to participants at remote locations. The essence is to allow for groups to collaborate over distances in a manner that emulates, as nearly as possible, the effectiveness of collaboration when the participants meet in person. Measure of Effectiveness The measure of effectiveness of a distributed collaboration often bases itself on the concept of collocation.Pamela Hinds & Sara Kiesler(MIT Press, 2002): Distributed Work, pp 55-143 The idea is to bring the team performance as nearly as possible to a scenario wherein the users are actually collocated. This further brings in the concept of Proximity. Studies have revealed that working on a familiar, previously worked upon topics, with people around you could increase the attentiveness and work output whereas, the same scenario, when applicable to an unfamiliar topic of work, could oftentimes prove to be distracting and unproductive.Zajonc, R. B. (1965): Attitudinal effect of mere exposure - Journal of Personality and Social Psychology Meaning of Collocation Decreasing proximity leads to asymptotic behavior in communication. This means that after a certain finite distance between participants, usually until the participants are actually out of sight of each other, the proximity can be treated the same as if participants were across continents. The usual type of collocation is the \\"Project Room\\" type of collocation wherein the resources for work are stored in a place (e.g. a cloud storage platform) and the participants come in and go out depending upon their availability to work. Another common collocation type is “Radical Collocation” which means all participants and resources are present in the place of work for the duration of the project. Advantages of Collocation on Distributed Collaboration Higher proximity (i.e. lesser distance between participants) usually increases the chances of collaboration.Kraut R. E., Egido C., and Galegher J. (1990): Patterns of contact and communication in scientific research collaboration This means that people on the same work floor are more likely to collaborate on a project than people in the same building but different work floors. The realization of collocation in a distributed collaborative environment can thus lead to higher productivity. Moreover, use of cyberinfrastructure, such as emails, instant messaging and document sharing help remove the requirement of synchronicity which would, erstwhile, have been imposed if the participants were to meet physically.  Infrastructures  Following (technical) infrastructures enables distributed collaboration over traditional collaboration: =Internet= The low cost and nearly instantaneous sharing of ideas, knowledge, and skills through the internet has made collaborative work dramatically easier. It allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members. Not only can a group cheaply communicate and test, but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups to easily form in the first place, even among niche interests. An example of this is the free software movement, which produced GNU and Linux from scratch.Bollier, D., & Firestone, C. M. (2007). The Rise Of Collective Intelligence. Decentralized Co-Creation of Value as a New Paradigm of Commerce and Culture. A Report of the Sixteenth Annual Aspen Institute Roundtable on Information Technology.Singh P. K. (2010). Introduction To Computer Networks. FK Publications. = Collaborative software = Computer-supported collaboration focuses on technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and societies. Collaborative software designed to help people involved in a common task to achieve their goals by creating a computer supported cooperative work, which includes all contexts in which technology is used to mediate human activities such as communication, coordination, cooperation, competition, entertainment, games, art, and music.http://oldwww.acm.org/conferences/cscw2004/call_intro.html It addresses \\"how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems.\\" Base technologies and software such as netnews, email, chat and wikis could be described as social, collaborative, both or neither. Those who say \\"social\\" seem to focus on so-called virtual community, while those who say \\"collaborative\\" seem to be more concerned with content management and the actual output. While software may be designed to achieve closer social ties or specific deliverables, it is hard to support collaboration without also enabling relationships to form, and hard to support a social interaction without some kind of shared co-authored works. = Cloud and document collaboration = Document collaboration is a system allowing people to collaborate across different locations using Internet, and cloud collaboration enabled approach.The Cloud, Day 10: Storing Data in the Cloud. PCWorld. Retrieved on 2013-08-10. In recent years, the market has seen a rapid development in document collaboration tools. Primitive document collaboration used email, whereby comments would be written in the email with the document attached. However, if the email is then forwarded or replied to, the comments can be easily lost, also it is hard to keep track of the most recent version of a document.Social Collaboration reinvented by Kerio Document-centric collaboration is the next step in the evolution of document collaboration. These systems put the document and its contents at the center of the process and allow users to tag the document and add content specific comments, maintaining a complete version control and records and storing all comments and activities associated around a document. These new innovations are only possible because of the development of cloud computing, whereby software and applications are provisioned on the Internet. Cloud collaboration today is promoted as a tool for collaboration internally between different departments within a firm, but also externally as a means for sharing documents with end- clients as receiving feedback. This makes cloud computing a very versatile tool for firms with many different applications in a business environment.Bradley, Tony. (2011) The Cloud, Day 10: Storing Data in the Cloud. PCWorld.How To Mark Up Documents In The Cloud - Social Business - Document. Informationweek.com (2011-11-03). = Crowdsourcing = Crowdsourcing is to divide work between participants to achieve a cumulative result.Hirth,Matthias; Hoßfeld, Tobias; Tran-Gia, Phuoc. Anatomy of a Crowdsourcing Platform - Using the Example of Microworkers.com . 5th IEEE International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing (IMIS 2011), June 2011, DOI: 10.1109/IMIS.2011.89 In modern crowdsourcing, individuals or organizations use contributions from Internet users, which provides a particularly good venue for distributed collaboration since individuals tend to be more open in web-based projects where they are not being physically judged or scrutinized, thus can feel more comfortable sharing. In an online atmosphere, more attention can be given to the specific needs of a project, rather than spending as much time in communication with other individuals. Crowdsourcing can either take an explicit or an implicit route. Explicit crowdsourcing lets users work together to evaluate, share, and build different specific tasks, while implicit crowdsourcing means that users solve a problem as a side effect of something else they are doing. Advantages of using crowdsourcing may include improved costs, speed, quality, flexibility, scalability, or diversity.Prpić, J., & Shukla, P. (2016). Crowd Science: Measurements, Models, and Methods. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Kauai, Hawaii: IEEE Computer Society Advantages of using crowdsourcing may include improved costs, speed, quality, flexibility, scalability, or diversity. Crowdsourcing in the form of idea competitions or innovation contests provides a way for organizations to learn beyond what their base of minds of employees provides.  Examples of distributed collaboration  = Peer production = Peer production (also may refer to as mass or social collaboration) is a way of producing goods and services that relies on self-organizing communities of individuals. In such communities, the labor of a large number of people is coordinated towards a shared outcome. Peer production is a process taking advantage of new collaborative possibilities afforded by the internet and has become a widespread mode of labor. One of the earliest instances of networked peer production is Project Gutenberg, a project in which volunteers make out-of-copyright works available online. Free and open source software, such as Linux and Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, are another examples of peer production. Commons-based peer production is a subset of peer production, in which the creative energy of large numbers of people is coordinated into large, meaningful projects, mostly without traditional hierarchical organization or financial compensation. = Collaborative Writing = Collaborative writing refers to projects where written works are collaboratively created by multiple people together rather than individually.Sharples, M. (1993). Adding a little structure to collaborative writing. In CSCW in Practice: An Introduction and Case Studies (pp. 51-67). Springer London. These projects might also collaboratively edited. Using collaborative writing tools can provide substantial advantages to projects ranging from increased user commitment to easier, more effective and efficient work processes. Since this software makes it easy for users to contribute from anywhere in the world, projects can benefit from distributed collaboration. Examples of these collaborative writing tools includes: * Collaborative programming including Web IDEs such as Cloud9 IDE, PythonAnywhere, and Eclipse Che for collaborative code-writing, and Mercurial and Git (used in GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and CodePlex) for collaborative revision control * Collaborative real-time editors such as ShareLaTeX, Etherpad, Hackpad, GoogleDocs, Microsoft Office, and Authorea * Online platforms mainly focused on collaborative fiction that allow other users to continue a story's narrative such as Protagonize and Ficly * Wikis like Wikipedia, Wikia, Baidu Baike and TV Tropes = Mobile collaboration = Mobile collaboration is a technology-based process of communicating using electronic assets and accompanying software designed for use in remote locations. Mobile collaboration utilizes wireless, cellular and broadband technologies enabling effective distributed collaboration independent of location, Where traditional video conferencing has been limited to boardrooms, offices, and lecture theaters, recent technological advancements have extended the capabilities of video conferencing for use with discreet, hand-held mobile devices, permitting true mobile collaborative possibilities. = Distributed collaborative learning = Collaborative learning is based on the model that knowledge can be created within a population where members actively interact by sharing experiences and take on asymmetry roles. Put differently, collaborative learning refers to methodologies and environments in which learners engage in a common task where each individual depends on and is accountable to each other.Dillenbourg, P. (1999). Collaborative Learning: Cognitive and Computational Approaches. Advances in Learning and Instruction Series. New York, NY: Elsevier Science, Inc. Technology is an important factor in distributed collaborative learning. The Internet has allowed for a shared space for groups to communicate. Virtual environments have been critical to allowing people to communicate long-distances but still feel like they are part of the group. Computer-supported collaborative learning is a relatively new educational paradigm within collaborative learning which uses technology in a learning environment to control and monitor interactions, to regulate tasks, rules, and roles, and to mediate the acquisition of new knowledge. An example of Computer-supported collaborative learning is MOOC, that support collaborative allow for a strong and engaging learning environment. = Collaborative translation = Collaborative translation is a translation technique that has been enabled by cloud collaboration technology where multiple translation participants with varying tasks participate simultaneously in a collaborative workspace with shared resources. They generally sharing a computer-assisted translation interface that includes tools for collaboration. The purpose of collaborative translation is to reduce the total time of the translation lifecycle, improve communications, particularly between translator and non-translator participants, and eliminate many management tasks. An example of collaborative translation is Duolingo, where members of the public were invited to translate content and vote on translations. The content came from organizations that pay Duolingo to translate it. Documents could be added to Duolingo for translation with an upload account which had to be applied for. = Crowdfunding = Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing and the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from a large number of people. Croudfunding is now often performed via Internet-mediated registries. Crowdfunding has been used to fund a wide range for-profit entrepreneurial ventures such as artistic and creative projects, medical expenses, travel, or community-oriented social entrepreneurship projects. Arguably the best-known example of crowdfunding, and also crowdsourcing, is Kickstarter which missioned to help bring creative projects to life. In Kickstarter, project creators choose a deadline and a minimum funding goal. As an assurance contract, if the goal is not met by the deadline, no funds are collected. The platform is open to backers from anywhere in the world and to creators from some certain countries.

Clark and Senator Robert F. Kennedy toured the Mississippi Delta on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarksdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing for a series of reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.  Background  275px In 1967, the majority of legislative program supporting the United States government's \\"War on Poverty\\" was due to expire. In an attempt to generate national interest in renewing funding for the effort, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held a series of hearings related to hunger, starting March 15. One of first the testifying witnesses was Marian Wright, a 27-year- old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were \\"starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [the senators] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and the number of people who are going around and begging just to feed their children.\\" Chairman Joseph S. Clark suggested that the subcommittee travel to Mississippi to verify Wright's testimony. Of the subcommittee's nine members, Senators Robert F. Kennedy, Jacob Javits, George Murphy agreed to the idea and accompanied him. Kennedy dispatched his aide, Peter Edelman, to get an advanced view on the situation. Edelman spoke extensively with Wright, whom he would marry 15 months later.  Trip to the Delta  The subcommittee members flew into Jackson on April 9. That evening the senators dined with prominent Mississippians, including Oscar Carr and Charles Evers. Carr later described Kennedy as \\"a very shy man\\" who \\"continuously asked questions.\\" Evers said \\"We talked and talked and he listened.\\" Local civil rights activist Amzie Moore acted as Kennedy's host. = Hearing in Jackson = A field hearing was scheduled for April 10. Mississippi Senator John Stennis, a staunch segregationist, was scheduled to be interviewed. He disapproved of the federal efforts to improve the economic situation of black people and sought to discredit them by attacking the Head Start program's parent agency, the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CDGM). The Head Start project provided services to impoverished children and was funded with grants from the federal government, thereby preventing state authorities from interfering with its activities. By potentially improving the socioeconomic status of black Mississippians, Head Start threatened the white political power base that dominated the state. Just days after money for the program had been appropriated, Stennis and state officials began scrutinizing it and requesting financial records. In the days before Stennis' scheduled testimony Jackson's two newspapers, both supportive of segregation, ran several stories about the senator's planned critique. Upon the poverty subcommittee's arrival in the city, Clark announced that he considered questions concerning Head Start and funding irregularities to already be answered and that the hearing would not spend significant time discussing the issue. Stennis responded by leaking his draft testimony to the press. The subcommittee hearing took place in the Olympic Ballroom of Hotel Heidelberg in Jackson. It was originally supposed to take place in a room meant to accommodate 300 persons, but the subcommittee relocated after local media attention stirred enough interest to bring the crowd to about 1,000 people. In his opening remarks, Clark stated that the hearing intended to be \\"neither a witch hunt or a whitewash. We are here to find out the basic facts.\\" Stennis was called as the first witness. He admitted that there was poverty in his state, but posited that federal anti-poverty programs were overrunning expected costs and that he wished to support taxpayers. He then declared that the federal government had bypassed \\"responsible, honest, capable local leadership\\" and in favor of northerners and as a result its offices had become \\"a stake hold of beatniks and immorality\\". He requested that the governor be empowered to suspend \\"any project he determines not in the public interest\\" and finished by highlighting the fact that $500,000–$650,000 dollars worth of CDGM's funds were proclaimed by a government audit to be unaccounted for. Clark then allowed members of the subcommittee to question Stennis. Kennedy presented a private report conducted by a New York-based firm at the behest of the college that hosted CDGM. According to the new audit, the amount of wasted funds was deemed to be \\"relatively minor\\" and no evidence was found to substantiate the government's allegation. Stennis was flustered and declared that the Senate Committee on Appropriations—of which he was a member—should have been informed of the conflicting calculations. He concluded, \\"It's another illustration of the mysterious way in which this independent agency operates,\\" thanked the committee for their time, and left the hotel. Testimony was then given about conditions in the Delta from both public officials and local impoverished inhabitants. A black doctor stated that the state suffered from a high infant mortality rate, and that the rate was twice as high for black babies. He added that the mortality rate of black babies from early childhood illnesses was five times greater than that for white infants. Head Start workers testified that older children they had examined displayed symptoms of anemia and other nutritional deficiencies. It was also stated that the decline in demand for agriculture labor increased unemployment, and that many of the adults were unskilled, did not have access to adequate transportation or training programs, or faced racial discrimination in their work. Robert Ezelle, former chairman of the Jackson Chamber of Commerce, asserted that the greatest problem afflicting Mississippi was its dysfunctional education system. He stated that 200,000 adults (out of the total 2 million) had not received schooling beyond the fourth grade and that a further 40,000 had never had any education. Civil rights activist Unita Blackwell defended the Head Start program, saying it was the only anti-poverty initiative that addressed the locals' problems. When questioned by Kennedy about hunger, she stated that there was a problem with hunger in her county and that the shift from surplus food aid to the stamp program had worsened the situation. Wright spoke once more, asserting, \\"After two civil rights bills and the third year of the poverty bill, the...Negro in Mississippi is poorer than he was, he has less housing, he is badly educated; he is almost in despair.\\" Kennedy took his greatest interest in the locals' statements. Afterwards, he told Evers, \\"I want to see it.\\" = Kennedy's and Clark's tour = left The following day Kennedy and Clark drove into the Delta area, while the other senators flew back to Washington D.C. They were accompanied by Evers, Wright, Moore, Edelman, Carr, a dozen or so reporters from state and national newspapers and the Big Three television networks, and an assortment of U.S. Marshals, state highway patrolmen, and local police. That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in Greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers. After lunch, Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80 mph down U.S. Route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore. Their first stop was a dilapidated shotgun house in Cleveland, in which 15 people resided. Holes were present in the flooring and roofing, and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter. One boy told Kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses, and that he didn't eat any lunch. Walking to the next house, Kennedy whispered to Edelman, \\"I've been to third- world countries and I've never seen anything like this.\\" The following home belonged to a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20-month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek. He said, \\"My God, I didn't know this kind of thing existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know.\\" Clark labeled what lay before them a \\"national disgrace.\\" Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry. Kennedy stepped outside and quietly remarked, \\"We spend $75 billion a year on armaments and $3 billion a year on dogs. We have to do more for these children that didn't ask to be born into this.\\" Local newspaper editor Cliff Langford, who strongly disliked Kennedy, shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed. Clark retorted, \\"Don't worry. We've been brainwashed from the other side.\\" Langford added, \\"I don't know of anybody starving down here.\\" Kennedy responded, \\"Step over here and I'll introduce you to some.\\" Clark reassured the reporters that he and Kennedy were not observing conditions in the Delta to \\"find fault,\\" but rather \\"just to see if we can do anything about it.\\" The senators' motorcade continued on towards Clarksdale, but Kennedy asked that they stop in the small town of Mound Bayou. With no advanced notice, Kennedy, his aides, and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a 39-year-old man named Andrew Jackson, his wife, and their six kids. There was no electricity, running water, or toilet. There were two pictures in the house; one of the Glorybound Singers (a Clarksdale-based Gospel group) and another of John F. Kennedy. Jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked, \\"Is you really Mr. Bobby Kennedy?\\" Kennedy smiled and shook his hand, replying, \\"Yes. And are you really Mr. Andrew Jackson?\\" A thousand people—mostly black school children—awaited the senators outside the Clarksdale Neighborhood Center. The two stayed in the city for only 20 minutes; Clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled, as their flight in Memphis was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was \\"going to catch that plane.\\" Meanwhile, Kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd. He said he was glad to have made the trip, and told them, \\"The problems of poverty are problems of all United States citizens.\\" He was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs, though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued onto the highway.  Aftermath  = Government response = Kennedy returned to Washington D.C. on the evening of April 10. He walked in on his family having dinner at Hickory Hill, highly agitated and, in the words of his daughter Kathleen, \\"ashen faced.\\" He announced to his children, \\"In Mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room. The children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food. Do you know how lucky you are? Do you know how lucky you are? Do something for your country.\\" The following morning Kennedy and Edelman met with Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families that had no income. Though Freeman was keen on avoiding a political dispute with Kennedy, he feared that by concurring with the senator he would anger the Southern bloc in Congress that held great influence over his department's budget. He deflected, \\"Bob, there isn't anyone in America who has no income.\\" Kennedy replied, \\"I'll tell you what. I'll send Peter [Edelman] here back down there with some of your people... Will you agree that you'll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in Mississippi who have no income?\\" Freeman agreed, and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps. Returning to New York on April 12, Kennedy exclaimed to the wife of one of his aides, \\"You don't know what I saw! I have done nothing in my life! Everything I have done was a waste! Everything I have done was worthless!\\" When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, Clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty. He also said that the United States needed a \\"reawakening of a conscience.\\" The entire subcommittee sent a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson about their discoveries and the findings of the Department of Agriculture officials who had been dispatched to the Delta, writing about \\"conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger...that can only be described as shocking\\" and imploring federal government to declare an emergency. Johnson never responded. Several Johnson administration officials, in addition to Freeman, were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the Delta. Johnson had seen the news coverage of the event and on April 17 he ordered that his top domestic aide, Joseph Califano, give him a \\"quick report.\\" Califano replied 20 minutes later, writing that Freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administration's food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by Congress. When his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan, Johnson, already uneasy about the food stamp program, rejected the proposal. Kennedy made a direct appeal to Johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for 40,000–60,000 of the most impoverished Mississippians. Johnson ignored it, a decision an editorial in The Nation claimed was due to the fact that he was \\"incapable of rising above personal politics.\\" Once news of the situation in the Delta went public, Mississippi Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. dismissed the report as the product of \\"Socialist-minded senators.\\" He also told journalist Bill Minor, \\"all the Negroes I've seen around here are so fat they shine.\\" Following the publication in June of a particularly severe report compiled by the Field Foundation of New York, Governor Johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about children's nutrition. Its findings concurred with those of the Field Foundation. On July 11 and July 12, Clark held another set of congressional hearings on hunger in the Delta to pressure Freeman, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators Stennis and James Eastland (also a staunch segregationist), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described \\"an unwritten policy on the part of those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death.\\" When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, \\"We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months ago[...]and we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi.\\" Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, \\"It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal.\\" In the end, Kennedy managed to amend the renewal of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition. Stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a $10 million emergency fund be established for food and medical services. Despite resistance from other Southern legislators and a lack of support from President Johnson, Stennis' bill passed. The Senate also voted unanimously to create a Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs. Kennedy subsequently embarked on more \\"poverty tours\\" to investigate and publicize impoverished conditions across the United States. He frequently invoked the Delta tour in legislative discussions and during his 1968 presidential campaign. = Public reaction = 300px The media coverage from the event brought national attention to the food insecurity issues in the Delta. Most Americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area. Almost immediately, the Field Foundation of New York dispatched a team of doctors to Mississippi to examine children and verify the senators' findings. They labeled the conditions they observed a \\"national disaster,\\" documenting cases of Kwashiorkor, Rickets, and other signs of malnutrition and starvation. One doctor likened state of affairs to the worst he had seen in eastern Kenya. This countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation. The Citizens Crusade Against Poverty, an advocacy group already studying the problems in the Delta, quickly created a \\"Citizens' Board of Inquiry into Hunger and Malnutrition in the United States.\\" In April 1968, the board published a report of its findings, entitled Hunger U.S.A.. This was shortly followed by a critique of the National School Lunch Program by a coalition of women's organizations. In conversation with Wright and Edelemen, Kennedy remarked, \\"The only way there's going to be change is if it's more uncomfortable for Congress not to act than it is for them to act...You've got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to Washington and stay here until[...]Congress gets really embarrassed and they have to act.\\" The following week Wright proposed the idea to Martin Luther King Jr., who subsequently organized the Poor People's March on Washington. Around the same time CBS broadcast a major documentary, Hunger in America, which had been made on the suggestion of Kennedy to television executive Don Hewitt.  Legacy  The trip to the Mississippi Delta made hunger a public issue of interest in the United States. Following the revelations of food insecurity, a powerful anti-hunger movement emerged in the country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones. Federal expenditures on food assistance grew by 500 percent over the next decade. Marian Wright would later say that the episode \\"set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in the virtual elimination of hunger in America during the Nixon years.\\" The Mississippi Delta tour was featured in the 1980s American civil rights documentary series, Eyes on the Prize. In May 1997, Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone, inspired by the original trip, visited the Delta to bring attention to \\"race and gender and poverty and children in America.\\" From July 11 until July 12, 2017, Wright led local activists and politicians on a bus tour of the region to observe the 50th anniversary of the event. It was followed by a panel discussion on poverty, hunger, and healthcare in the Mississippi.

The idea is generally used by web analytics as well as in online advertising. In contrary to the sharing on social networking service like Facebook, which is done publicly, Dark social is done privately through IRC channels, emails, SMS or simply copy-and-paste and other ways of private sharing. Not to confuse with deep web, dark social media is not about the content but the traffic of online sharing. These sharing activities will often come up under the name of direct, typed/bookmarked or other similar form in today's web analytic services. And in 2014, it is believed that Dark Social consisted of 69% of sharing activities globally, whereas Facebook only holds 23%. However, the exact nature of dark social media is still unknown, as the word \\"dark\\" in the name itself suggests that unknown or can't-see is in the heart of the concept like dark energy in astronomy.  History  Alexis Madrigal was curious about where traffic was really coming from for the site that he worked for, The Atlantic. He grew up in a time when the web was just being built and knew there were other ways to share information, not just through big name sites like Facebook. This lead him to believe that a large portion of web traffic was not coming from “bookmarked” or “typed in” sources as he was being led to believe. With the help of web analytics firm, Chartbeat, he was able to quantify this traffic into something much more meaningful. The article that he then wrote brought about the usage of the term Dark Social. Dark social has also been known as direct social or dark traffic. However, Alexis Madrigal’s term \\"Dark Social\\" is the most widely used.  Desktop vs mobile  Dark social media can be perceived differently when looking at desktop computers vs mobile computers. In 2014, almost 50% of the total external mobile traffic was Dark Social traffic, meaning that the traffic did not have a referrer showing where they were coming from. In contrast, only one-third of the external desktop traffic was from Dark Social. In 2014, two years after Alexis Madrigal wrote the original post about dark social, he started to notice that dark social traffic could come from mobile devices as well. Madrigal mentioned that since October 2015, Facebook had changed their algorithm for the mobile app, which resulted in the media publisher receiving over 100% more traffic than before. In the meantime, he has also noticed the Atlantic, the company he used to work for, received a lot of dark social traffic, which was not the Facebook mobile traffic. Alexis Madrigal later performed an experiment to confirm his theory that the dark social traffic boost was indeed from Facebook mobile app. He found that the referrer links from Facebook’s mobile app don’t always pass to the destination website, which creates Dark Social traffic for mobile devices. An updated Charbeat report also confirmed that part of the Dark Social traffic was generated by Facebook mobile app and its own users. In addition to Facebook mobile app, dark social traffic can also come from Reddit mobile app, Gmail and Instant messaging apps as well. In one of RadiumOne’s report published in February 2016, the dark side of mobile sharing, the company stated they have found that 84% of the online traffic is coming from Dark Social channels to date. Furthermore, they also showed that out of all the Dark Social traffic, 62% are from mobile devices, while only 38% are from desktops. The rise of smart phones and mobile apps had largely increased the Dark Social traffic on mobile devices over the last few years. The amount of Dark Social traffic from mobile devices jumps from 53% in 2014 to 62% in 2016, while the Dark Social traffic that comes from desktops decreases from 47% in 2014 to 38% in 2016.  Marketing and analytics  Dark Social traffic consists mostly of one-to-one messaging through non-dark channels such as Facebook Messenger and Snapchat rather than more commonly used one-to-many methods; for example, sharing to a Twitter feed, or Facebook wall, which traditional analytics tools rely upon. Links shared through private messaging methods may not include referral tags and to an analytics tool, they can simply appear as though they came through direct traffic or could include referral tags copy and pasted from another non-dark social channel. Because the referral tags are not always carried over through private messaging, it becomes impossible to tell if a person sharing through dark traffic had originally obtained the content through another referral method or directly copy-pasting the link. This makes it difficult for marketers to understand how effective their social media marketing strategy is and make changes accordingly. To combat this lack of transparency, websites can include more attractive ways to share links than simply copy-pasting into another application; for example, sites can implement highly visible share buttons, a copy-paste button, or buttons to share a link with a referral tag directly to a dark social channel like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or email. Rules can also be made within traditional analytics tools to filter out dark social traffic that can include direct links, but exclude those that weren't referred from the homepage. Analytics tools are also beginning to incorporate the ability to distinguish between dark social copy-paste based traffic and other types of traffic.  Relationship to the invisible web and dark web  The invisible web is also known as the deep web. Where dark social is referring to web traffic that cannot be analyzed, invisible web is referring to websites and data that are not indexed in search engines. In essence, both kinds of information are invisible to the general population on the Internet. Dark social data cannot be found by web analytics software to see where traffic originates from and invisible web data will not show when using search engines like Google Search or Microsoft Bing. Both of these hidden results are unintentional. The dark web is associated with Dark social and invisible web, but mainly because of its hidden nature. Dark web data is data that is intentionally hidden on the Internet because those involved wish to remain anonymous.  Who shares via dark social  There is interest in who shares content and how they share it. The psychology of dark social sharing has found that people share for three reasons. ;1. Identity and context Dark social sharing allows for individualism as people are able to freely express themselves in choosing what- and with whom- to share rather than broadcasting everything to all their “friends.” ;2. Relationship building''' Dark social sharing creates a “personal” channel where sharing elevates and builds personal relationships, even defying geographical boundaries. ;3. Social currency Dark Social sharing allows for people to feel helpful, on trend, or interesting. When sharing to a smaller, intimate social circle, the sharer gets to be knowledgeable within their groups, giving them street cred. Email and IM are the common sources of dark social sharing but Facebook may actually be the part of the cause of the increase in dark social-through their chatting and messaging services. Other sources of Dark Social are Reddit, StumbleUpon, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn and Google+, WhatsApp, Viber, Kwik, Firechat, OM and Livetext. There is some evidence by Pew research that age accounts for who is sharing darkly and those sharing by means that can be tracked easier. Baby Boomers (born between 1946-1964) and Gen Xers (born between 1965-1981) commonly share by email and word of mouth. In fact, Gen Xers are the heaviest users of email, which is considered dark social. Millennials (born 1982-1995) and younger tend toward social media and sharing through these applications, often reported as dark. In addition, sharing professionally and darkly, as on LinkedIn, requires upwards of 15 hours a week to have an impact. Certain platforms also attract other types of populations such as blogs with the LGBT community.

A catechol estrogen is a steroidal estrogen that contains catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) within its structure. The catechol estrogens are endogenous metabolites of estradiol and estrone and include the following compounds: * 2-Hydroxylated:  2-Hydroxyestradiol  2-Hydroxyestrone  2-Hydroxyestriol * 4-Hydroxylated:  4-Hydroxyestradiol  4-Hydroxyestrone  4-Hydroxyestriol The most abundant catechol estrogen in serum and urine is 2-hydroxyestrone, with 2-hydroxyestradiol and 2-hydroxyestriol also being formed, while the principal 4-hydroxy catechol estrogen, 4-hydroxyestrone, is present in only small amounts in urine. 4-Hydroxyestriol has been detected in the urine of pregnant women. The catechol estrogens are formed from estradiol and estrone by cytochrome P450 enzymes predominantly in the liver but also in extrahepatic tissues, and are metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) into methoxylated estrogens such as 2-methoxyestradiol and 4-methoxyestrone as well as by conjugation via other phase II enzymes. Under poor conditions of inactivation by phase II enzymes, catechol estrogens can undergo oxidation to reactive quinones and semiquinones, and this has been hypothesized to contribute to estrogen-induced carcinogenesis. Similarly to estradiol and estrone, catechol estrogens possess estrogenic activity. 2-Hydroxylated catechol estrogens are weak and possibly antiestrogenic estrogens, whereas their 4-hydroxylated counterparts are more potent in their estrogenic activity. For instance, 2-hydroxyestrone reportedly shows negligible uterotrophic effect in animals, whereas 4-hydroxy catechol estrogens show moderate changes in stimulating uterine weight. In addition to being substrates for COMT similarly to catecholamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, catechol estrogens are potent competitive inhibitors of COMT as well as of tyrosine hydroxylase, and may affect both catecholamine biosynthesis and metabolism.

Early years Attic figures, Hamilton County Memorial Building Born in Cincinnati, Ohio Barnhorn began his art studies at the Art Academy of Cincinnati where he studied under Italian sculptor Lewis T. Rebisso and woodcarver Henry L. Fry. This was followed by studies in Paris at the Académie Julien under Bouguereau, Peuch and Mercié. Barnhorn's sculptures were executed in stone or metal, or in ceramic faience for Rookwood Pottery. His \\"Magdalen\\" received Honorable Mention at the Paris Salon in 1895, and bronze at the Paris Exposition in 1900. He also won medals at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904. Barnhorn returned to teach at the Art Academy in 1900 to succeed his mentor, Rebisso, who had died. He served as head of the academy's sculpture department, and as the Art Museum's honorary curator of sculpture, positions he held until his death in 1935. His relationship with Frank Duveneck went beyond friendship. Barnhorn invited Duveneck to his Pike Street studio and provided tools and guidance in the memorial sculpture to Duveneck's wife (1891). The two shared the third-floor studio space in the Art Museum, and collaborated on several pieces. Barnhorn created the memorial for Duveneck (1924-1925) on his tomb in Mother of God Cemetery in Covington. A remarkable number of Barnhorn's works can be found around Cincinnati. Barnhorn was a renowned ecclesiastic sculptor, noted for \\"Madonna and Child\\" and \\"The Assumption of Mary into Heaven\\" at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in Covington, Kentucky, and the \\"Crucifixion Group\\" at St. Monica-St. George Church in University Heights. He assisted Rebisso on the William Henry Harrison statue in Piatt Park, and carved the soldier statues on the frieze above Memorial Hall.

The pond is in area. Three small streams run into it, and one runs out to sea. Tuxis Pond is about above sea level. The shores are mostly rocky with little sand or soil. Many nearby businesses have taken the name of the pond, including a lumber company, bookseller, grill, highway, golf club, art show, and assisted living facility. The pond was previously known to Native Americans as Tuxisshoag or Tuckshishoag. The pond is bordered on its western edge by the Tuxis Pond Walkway, an elevated boardwalk that permits viewing of the pond's wetland habitats. The walkway was contentiously approved in 1994 at an initial cost of $350,000, and an additional $400,000 in state funds were secured for the walkway's refurbishment in 2016. Flora and fauna The pond is home to a vast array of fish, amphibians, and reptiles, as well as semi-aquatic mammals and birds. Other native birds and mammals use the pond as well. The most common bird seen there is the piping plover. The pond is surrounded by trees on most parts, as well as grass and shrubs. The pond itself is host to several varieties of water plants. The areas surrounded by trees are a small, typical New England forest, mainly deciduous trees with some evergreens. The underbrush, too, consists of all the expected grasses, mosses, ferns, and shrubs. The canopy provides adequate shade for some cooler climate lichens. There are many fungi, as well. There are often algal blooms in the warmer months. Folklore The Algonquin in the area claimed that Odziozo, the great giant, created Tuxis Pond after following a flock of geese from his newly carved-out Lake Champlain. They led him down the glaciers to what today is Madison. He scooped out some earth, forming the pit that would become Tuxis Pond, and flung it out to sea to create Tuxis Island. As he flung it, a single rock fell from his hand and is now known as Samson Rock. This rock has a somewhat foot-shaped groove in the top, supposedly from when Odziozo turned around to go home and stepped on it. The pond filled up with the water that splashed out of the sound when Tuxis Island hit the water. This same legend was sometimes told by Europeans with the role of Odziozo being given to the biblical Samson.

Life Born in Jilemnice, he studied at the Prague Polytechnic where he was accepted from the Příbram Mining College (later the Mining College of Further Education and now the Technical University of Ostrava). Like another well known Czech geologist František Vacek, he was influenced by the principal of Prague Polytechnic Johann Grimm. After graduating he worked as a mining trainee whilst studying at the Imperial Geological Institute in Vienna. During this time, he gained experience and knowledge in the field at various places in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1870 he was appointed a chief geologist for Hungary and conducted research on the Slovak deposits in Magurka, Špania Dolina, Kremnica a Nová Baňa. Four years later he returned to Vienna and served as vice chancellor at the former Ministry of Agriculture. In addition to his research in Austria, he visited the deposits in Nevada and California. In 1879 he returned to Příbram, where he headed the School of Economic Geology and earned the title of professor. During this period he continued his research around the Příbram district. In 1889 he prematurely ended his work and retired to the suburbs of Vienna, from which he conducted a number of scientific tours across Europe and the Middle East. He died in Döbling in Vienna in the company of his wife, Clotilde Pošepný. According to his wishes, he buried in his native town Jilemnice. Legacy Pošepný is considered the founder of deposit geology, whose findings enable a more efficient extraction of ore. In his magnum opus The Genesis of Ore-Deposits (1893) Pošepný described a new theory of the origin of ore deposits.http://www.cim.org/en/Publications-and-Technical- Resources/Publications/CIM-Magazine/2011/august/history/economic-geology.aspx The theory received great recognition worldwide.

Life and work  Samuil Bernstein was born in Barguzin, a village east of Lake Baikal in what is today Republic of Buryatia, in the family of Boris Samuilovich Bernstein, a revolutionary exiled to Siberia. With his parents' family, he moved around the Soviet Far East, including a few years in Alexandrovsk-Sakhalinsky, then the capital of Soviet Sakhalin Oblast. As there was no high school in town, he left his parents to attend a high school on the mainland, in Nikolsk Ussuriyski (now Ussuriysk). In 1928, he entered Moscow State University, graduating in 1931. In 1934 Bernstein earned his Cand. Sc. degree, with a dissertation on the Turkish influence in the language of the Bulgarian translations of the Thesauros, the collection of sermons of Damaskinos Stouditis.Biography of S.B. Bernstein at the Moscow State University web site His first academic job was in Odessa, where he became the chair of the Department of Bulgarian in the local teacher's institute (mostly training teachers for the ethnic-Bulgarian towns and villages), and, later, the chair of the Linguistics Department at the University of Odessa. Bernstein moved to Moscow in 1939, soon joining the faculty of Moscow University. He received his Dr. Sc. degree in 1946, with a dissertation on the language of Slavic manuscripts from the Principality of Wallachia of the 14-15th centuries. In 1943, as the Soviet Army was about to liberate the countries of the Eastern Europe and to establish pro-Soviet governments there, it was decided by the Soviet Government that the USSR would soon need a large number of experts with training in various languages of these countries. At the time, few students in the USSR majored in West Slavic or South Slavic languages; to cure this perceived deficiency, the MSU was tasked by the then Minister of Education, Sergey Kaftanov, with the urgent creation of a Slavicist training program; Bernstein became one of the scholars entrusted with this project. He became instrumental in the creation of the Section (kafedra) of the Slavic Languages at the university's Department of Philology, hiring suitable staff and designing instructional materials. He served as the chair of the section in 1947-1970. (Ironically, by mid-1950s a decade after the Section was created, Bernstein was to learn that Kaftanov's predictions were wrong, and employment opportunities for Slavic majors failed to materialize. To make its graduates more employable, the department added some education coursework to the Slavics curriculum, so that its graduates could at least find jobs as Russian languages and literature teachers in secondary schools.May 10, 1955 entry in Bernstein's diary, Зигзаги памяти) Samuil Bernstein was a major contributor to the Atlas of the Bulgarian Dialects in the USSR, and author of dictionaries, textbooks, and numerous other works on the Bulgarian language and other Slavic and Balkan languages.

Collas's work primarily consisted of oil paintings and miniature water colors. Portrait de Jean-Charles-Auguste, dit John, Géraud Portrait d'Elisabeth Ferriere, épouse de John Géraud Collas moved to America in the 1810s. Collas was one of the most influential and important French miniature painters that came to America and New Orleans. He exhibited in the Paris Salon as well as several Academies of Fine Arts in America. Although originally from France, Collas is considered an American artist. Artist's Life Louis Antoine Collas was born in Bordeaux, France in 1775. Little to no information can be found on the early childhood of Collas. Collas started his art career and studied under François-André Vincent in Paris. He debuted at the Paris Salon in 1798 with one self portrait. The next year he sent several miniatures to the Paris Salon and would periodically continue to do so. Between 1803 (though it is claimed he moved in 1808) and 1811, Collas moved to St. Petersburg, Russia where he painted aristocrats and various people of high status. While in Russia, Collas worked for Czar Alexander I's court. Other notable figures that he painted while in Russia were Duchess Catherine Pavlovna and Prince Serge Nikolaewitch Galitinne. Collas left Russia in 1811 and moved back to Paris. After returning to Paris, Collas exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1812. Between 1812 and 1816, little is known of what he was doing until he arrived in New York City and listed himself as \\"Lewis Collers\\" in New York City directory. He exhibited thirteen miniatures, three of which were on porcelain, at the Academy of Fine Arts in New York between 1816 and 1820. He exhibited several miniatures at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1819. Collas traveled along the East Coast advertising in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Charleston. Collas returned to New York in 1820 where he exhibited in another Academy of Fine arts exhibition. He visited New Orleans in 1822 and was one of the earliest European artists to work in New Orleans. He was identified as a \\"portrait and miniature painter\\" and that he was living at 35 St. Peter Street. He had come into the painting genre for local patrons before Jean-Francios de Vallee, a miniature painter who was superior to Collas. Vallee was successful but he didn't receive as much attention in the press as Collas did. Collas was praised in the Louisiana Gazette. On January 20, 1823 the Louisiana Gazette stated: \\"We notice with pleasure at Mr. Elkin's Exchange a Frame enclosing miniature paintings by Mr. Collas. The finish of his portraits leave nothing to be desired for resemblance. We can compare it with the life-sized portrait above the frame. It is a speaking likeness. Everyone can recognize the artist whom one of his colleagues has delineated. Unfortunately, fate has snatched Lancelin from us. I do not pretend to make any comparison between the two painters, but I will limit myself by saying that the real and beautiful talent of Mr. Collas should be encouraged in all cities, and since those I have seen in France, I have found nothing more graceful than his works.\\" Collas announced his return in the New Orleans papers with notices almost every year after his flattering criticism. These notices stated ads such as \\"Collas, L.- Painter, Has the honor of informing his friends and the public of New Orleans, that he has returned to this city, and intends to exercise his art in portrait and miniatures.\\" These adds continued from 1823 to 1829 normally around April and were nearly identical. Sometime between 1831 and 1832, Collas returned to Paris. He exhibited again at the Paris Salon, but didn't receive as much attention or notice as what he usually achieved. It is believed that Collas died in Paris in 1833, but no documentation can be found. Collas's place of death is unknown. Artist's Work A portrait of Mrs. Andry by Louis Antoine Collas Collas's portrait of Mrs. Andry was likely a member of the Andrey family (also spelled Andry or André). The Andrey family was very active in federal and colonial militias in Louisiana. The family owned multiple plantations in St. James Parish. Collas's Mrs. Andry is very likely to be the same Mrs. André who intrigued John James Audubon. Audubon wrote in his diary on February 21, 1821 saying \\"one of those discouraging incidents connected with the life of the artists. I had a likeness spoken of in very rude terms by the fair lady it was made for, and perhaps will loos my time and the reward expected for my labours.\\" Audubon identified her later by her name: \\"Mrs. André - I mention name as I may speak more of the likeness as the occasion will require.\\" Collas depicts a possible widow André, who lived on Armour Street in 1829. Her eyes are grey which seem sad and tired. Her distant gaze is to give off the sense of contemplation, deep emotion and reverie. Collas's Portrait of a Free Woman of Color Wearing a Tignon was painted in 1829 while he was in New Orleans. This painting resides in the New Orleans Museum of Art on display. The woman in the painting was an unknown free woman of color which was pretty rare especially in southern states like Louisiana. The woman in the picture is wearing a tignon, a headdress worn by women in Louisiana with African descent. A law in 1786 mandated both women of free color and enslaved dark-skinned women must wear a head scarf so that could be distinguished from white women. Free women of color subverted the intent of the law and adopted vibrant luxury fabrics to wear for their own artistic self-fashioning. The woman in the painting seems to be proud of her heritage, and is proud to wear her vibrant green tignon. She is seated, commonly seen in portraits of women, with a smile on her face while staring directly at the viewer. Her expression gives a sense of sarcasm. Her expression reads, \\"You thought this would oppress us, but all you id was give us a great fashion trend.\\" References Category:French portrait painters Category:French emigrants to the United States ","title":"Louis Antoine Collas"},{"id":"51844861","text":"Aquimarina pacifica is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium from the genus of Aquimarina which has been isolated from seawater from the South Pacific Gyre from the Pacific Ocean.

The movement connects R&B;, the Civil Rights Movement, and hip hop culture.  Who Coined The Elements Of Hip Hop Movement  The six elements of the Hip Hop Movement are consciousness awareness, civil rights awareness, activism awareness, justice, political awareness, and community awareness in music. In 1990, while working with the rap/pop group Snap!, Ronald \\"Bee-Stinger\\" Savage coined the term \\"six elements of the Hip Hop Movement\\".

Intersex people were historically termed hermaphrodites, \\"congenital eunuchs\\",Mason, H.J., Favorinus’ Disorder: Reifenstein’s Syndrome in Antiquity?, in Janus 66 (1978) 1–13.Nguyễn Khắc Thuần (1998), Việt sử giai thoại (History of Vietnam's tales), vol. 8, Vietnam Education Publishing House, p. 55 or even congenitally \\"frigid\\". Such terms have fallen out of favor, now considered to be misleading and stigmatizing. Intersex people have been treated in different ways by different religions and cultures, and numerous historical accounts exist. Judaism The Talmud contains extensive discussion concerning the status of two intersex types in Jewish law; namely the androginus, which exhibits both male and female external sexual organs, and the tumtum which exhibits neither. The nature of the androgynous is a topic first expanded upon explicitly in the Mishna, where debate arises as to the individual’s classification as either male or female. The Talmud discusses it primarily in two places, in Tractate Bikkurim and in Tractate Yevamot. One opinion in Tractate Bikkurim indicates that the androgynos has elements of the male, elements of the female, elements of both, and elements of neither. The other opinion insists that the androgynos is its own sex - a category unto itself. Yevamot conducts a much lengthier analysis, where a variety of different approaches are considered in light of the opinions established in Bikkurim. In these discussions, the Talmudic personalities delineate four theoretical categories into which the androgynos may fall: * The sex of the individual is unknown. They may be male or may be female, but their true identity remains in doubt. * They are their own sex, a category unto themselves completely separate from the male and female sexes. * They are both male and female, that is, they exist simultaneously as a member of both sexes. * They are considered male. Because they possess male sexual characteristics, they belong to the male sex. Jewish Law has specific legal obligation that differ for men and women, and thus gender becomes an exceedingly important aspect of one’s identity. When determining the legal gender of androgynos individuals, a minority of Jewish Law decisors, “posek”, classify androgynos individuals as completely male. Therefore, androgynos individuals would be obligated by law in the same way as men. However, the majority of Talmudic commentators and Jewish Law decisors do not assign androgynos individuals a fixed gender, and instead leave them in a status of doubtful identity. Because of the androgynos person’s uncertain identity, they can be classified differently in varying cases - sometimes male, sometimes female, sometimes both male and female, and other times neither. The legal ramifications of such an attitude forces the individual to adhere to Jewish law as both a male and female. According to this classification, in cases where the law differs for men and women, androgynos individuals must adhere to the stricter option. For example, time-bound positive mitzvot (commandments) that men are obligated to keep and women are exempted, androgynos individuals must keep the obligation. Those who classify an androgynos individual as definitively both male and female would agree with this principle, though practice may differ in certain cases. The difference between classifying an androgynos individual as only male or as a doubtful identity would manifest itself in a case where performing a commandment would also require a blessing in conjunction. According to those who maintain that an androgynos has an uncertain sex, the individual would not recite the blessing. This is because the only men may recite this blessing, and if the individual isn't a man, they would be reciting the blessing in vain. However, according to the opinions who maintain that the individual is fully male, then they would recite the blessing as any other male would. Christianity Eunuchs are mentioned many times in the Bible, such as in the Book of Isaiah (56:4) using the word סריס (saris). Matthew establishes that the term refers to some individuals from birth, as well as individuals made eunuchs through castration: The reference to \\"eunuchs\\" in Matthew 19:12 has yielded various interpretations. Roman law and post-classical Canon law referred to a person's sex as male, female or hermaphrodite, with legal rights as male or female depending on the characteristics that appeared most dominant. Under Roman law, a hermaphrodite had to be classed as either male or female.Lynn E. Roller, \\"The Ideology of the Eunuch Priest,\\" Gender & History 9.3 (1997), p. 558. The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that \\"Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails\\".Decretum Gratiani, C. 4, q. 2 et 3, c. 3 According to Raming, Macy and Cook, the Canon lawyer Huguccio states that, \\"If someone has a beard, and always wishes to act like a man (excercere virilia) and not like a female, and always wishes to keep company with men and not with women, it is a sign that the male sex prevails in him and then he is able to be a witness, where a woman is not allowed\\". On ordainment, Raming, Macy and Cook found that the Decretum Gratiani states, \\"item Hermafroditus. If therefore the person is drawn to the feminine more than the male, the person does not receive the order. If the reverse, the person is able to receive but ought not to be ordained on account of deformity and monstrosity.\\" On August 29, 2017, the evangelical Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood in the United States released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \\"Nashville Statement\\". The statement states in part, \\"WE AFFIRM that the differences between male and female reproductive structures are integral to God’s design for self-conception as male or female. WE DENY that physical anomalies or psychological conditions nullify the God-appointed link between biological sex and self-conception as male or female\\" and, \\"WE AFFIRM that those born with a physical disorder of sex development are created in the image of God and have dignity and worth equal to all other image-bearers. They are acknowledged by our Lord Jesus in his words about “eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb.” With all others they are welcome as faithful followers of Jesus Christ and should embrace their biological sex insofar as it may be known. WE DENY that ambiguities related to a person’s biological sex render one incapable of living a fruitful life in joyful obedience to Christ.\\" Due to perceived homophobia, transphobia, and misogyny, the Nashville Statement has attracted controversy. Islam Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed discussions on the status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. An intersex person is called a Khunthaa in the books of Fiqh. There are three types of Khunthaa: # A person has aspects of both organs, and urinates from the male organ. This person will be included among the males and the laws regarding males will fall on him. # The person urinates from the female organ so will be included among the females. The laws related to females will fall on this person. This applies before the person reaches maturity. After maturity, the person will be rechecked. If he experiences wet dreams like a male then he will be counted as a male. On the other hand, if the person develops breasts and other signs of being feminine the she will be included among the females. # When both masculine and feminine signs are equal and it cannot be determined whether the person is more male or more female then such a person is termed Khunthaa Mushkil. There are different laws regarding such a person, a few examples: It is not permissible for a Khunthaa Mushkil to wear silk and jewellery. Both these are permissible for females. But because this person’s condition cannot be ascertained, so precaution demands that such a person not wear silk and jewellery, because of the possibility that the person may be more male. Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum. If a Ghayr Mahram is rendering the Tayammum then the person has to wear a cloth over the hands. A Mahram does not have to wear a cloth over the hands. With regard to marriage of one who is intersex, if it is an unambiguous case, then according to how he or she is classified, he or she may marry someone of the opposite gender. If it is an ambiguous case, then the marriage of such a person cannot be valid, the reason being that he may be male, in which case how can he marry another male, or may be female, in which case she can't marry another female like her. If this individual is sexually attracted to females and claims to be a man, this is a sign that he is most likely male, and vice versa. Intersex medical interventions are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a person’s exterior, chromosomal make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allah’s creation or imitation of the opposite sex. Anitism Lakapati is a hermaphrodite and a major fertility deity in the Tagalog mythology. Her prowess on fertility covers not only human and divine fertility, but also the fertility of all other things such as wildlife, crops, trees, and plants. She is also the goddess of cultivated land. A prayer dedicated to Lakapati was recited by children when sowing seeds: \\"Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin (Lakapati, feed this thy slave; let him not hunger)\\". Prominent among deities who received full-blown sacrifices, Lakapati is represented by a hermaphrodite image with both male and female parts and was worshiped in the fields at planting time. Hinduism Sangam literature uses the word pedi to refer to people born with an intersex condition; it also refers to antharlinga hijras and various other hijras. Intersex people are popularly known as Mabedi Usili in Hijra community but their identity always remained as a distinct identity from popular hijra community. In Tirumantiram Tirumular recorded the relationship between Intersex people and Shiva Warne and Raza argue that an association between intersex and hijra people is mostly unfounded, but popular misunderstandings \\"cause tremendous fear in the parents\\" of intersex infants and children.

The polity appeared in foreign records from as early as the 5th century and at its height, covered much of modern state of Pahang and the entire southerly part of the peninsula. Throughout its pre-Melakan history, Pahang was established as a mueang or naksat of some major regional Malayic mandalas including Langkasuka, Srivijaya and Ligor. Around the middle of the 15th century, it was brought into the orbit of Melaka Sultanate and subsequently established as a vassal Muslim Sultanate in 1470, following the coronation of the grandson of the former Maharaja as the first Sultan of Pahang. Names The naming of Pahang relates to the ancient practice in Malayic culture of defining territorial definitions and apportioning lands by water-sheds. The term 'Pahang' in referring to the kingdom thus, is thought to originate from the name of Pahang River. There have been many theories on the origin of the name. According to Malay legend, across the river at Kampung Kembahang where the present stream of the Pahang parts company with the Pahang Tua, in ancient time stretched a huge mahang tree (macaranga) from which the river and kingdom derived their name. This legend agrees with oral tradition among Proto-Malay Jakun peoples that say their forefathers called the country Mahang. Other notable theory was espoused by William Linehan, that relates the early foundation of the kingdom to the settlers from ancient Khmer civilisation, and claims its naming origin to the word saamnbahang (Khmer: សំណប៉ាហាំង) meaning 'tin', based on the discovery of prehistoric tin mines in the state. There were many variations of the name Pahang in history. The Book of Song referred to the kingdom as Pohuang or Panhuang. The Chinese chronicler Zhao Rugua knew it as Pong-fong. According to the continuation of Ma Duanlin's Wenxian Tongkao, Pahang was called Siam-lao thasi. By Arabs and Europeans, the kingdom was variously styled Pam, Pan, Paam, Paon, Phaan, Phang, Paham, Pahan, Pahaun, Phaung, Phahangh. History =Prehistory= Archaeological evidences revealed the existence of human habitation in the area that is today Pahang from as early as the paleolithic age. At Gunung Senyum have been found relics of mesolithic civilisation using pleolithic implements. At Sungai Lembing, Kuantan, have been discovered paleolithic artefacts chipped and without trace of polishing, the remains of a 6,000 years old civilisation. Traces of Hoabinhian culture is represented by a number of limestone cave sites. Late neolithic relics are abundant, including polished tools, quoit discs, stone ear pendants, stone bracelets and cross-hatched bark pounders. By around 400 BC, the development of bronze casting led to the flourishing of the Đông Sơn culture, notably for its elaborate bronze war drums. The early iron civilisation in Pahang that began around the beginning of Common Era is associated by prehistorians with the late neolithic culture. Relics from this era, found along the rivers are particularly numerous in Tembeling Valley, which served as the old main northern highway of communication. Ancient gold workings in Pahang are thought to date back to this early Iron Age as well. =Early period= The Kra Isthmus region of the Malay peninsula and its peripheries are recognised by historians as the cradle of Malayic civilisations. Primordial Malayic kingdoms are described as tributaries to Funan by the 2nd century Chinese sources. Ancient settlements can be traced from Tembeling to as far south as Merchong. Their tracks can also be found in deep hinterland of Jelai, along the Chini Lake, and up to the head-waters of the Rompin. A polity identified as Koli in Geographia or Kiu-Li, centred on the estuary of Pahang River south of Langkasuka, flourished in the 3rd Century CE. It possessed an important international port, where many foreign ships stopped to barter and resupply. In common with most of the states in the Malay Peninsula during that time, Kiu-Li was in contact with Funan. The Chinese records mention that an embassy sent to Funan by the Indian King Murunda sailed from Kiu-Li's port (between 240-245 CE). Murunda presented tot the Funanese King Fan Chang four horses from the Yuezhi (Kushan) stud farms. By the middle of the 5th century, another polity suggestive as ancient Pahang, was described in the Book of Song as Pohuang or Panhuang (婆皇). The king of Pohuang, She-li- Po-luo-ba-mo ('Sri Bhadravarman') was recorded to have sent an envoy to the Liu Song court in 449-450 with forty one types of products. In 456-457, another envoy of the same country, led by a Senapati, arrived at the Chinese capital, Jiankang. This ancient Pahang is believed to had been established later as a mueang to the mandala of Langkasuka-Kedah centred in modern-day Patani region that rose to prominence with the regression of Funan from the 6th century. The Langkasuka-Kedah with its city states that controlled both coastal fronts of Malay peninsula, assumed importance in the trading network involving Rome, India and China. The growth in trade brought in foreign influence throughout these city states. The discovery of many Buddhist votive tablets and Hindu icons points toward strong Indian influence during this period. By the beginning of the 8th century, Langkasuka-Kedah came under the military and political hegemony of Srivijaya. However, the gradual domination of Langkasuka-Kedah was not achieved by conventional warfare, and no records of major seaborne naval expeditions exist. The submission of Langkasuka-Kedah to the might of Srivijaya was of benefit and interest to the former for, as a commercial centre, it was useful to be allied to a powerful with a navy strong enough to protect them. =Classical period= In the centuries that followed, up to the final decline of Srivijaya, Langkasuka- Kedah was one of its closest allies and Kedah rose to become a principal port and even the seat of the Srivijayan Maharaja. Langkasuka-Kedah's fortune were, therefore intertwined with Srivijaya's, and the former's decline only came after the fall of the latter to Chola raids from South India in the 11th century. The power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the rise of Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom, commonly known in Malay tradition as 'Ligor'. By the 13th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula including Pahang under its mandala. During this period, Pahang, designated as Muaeng Pahang was established as one of the twelve naksat city states of Ligor. In the early 14th century, the fortune of Ligor was in turn eclipsed by the rise of Thai Buddhist power, and the expansion southwards by Ram Khamhaeng of Sukhotai who brought it under Thai hegemony. The 14th century, was the time of the earliest recorded evidence of Islam in the east coast of Malay peninsula. The period also coincides with Pahang, began consolidating its influence in the southern part of the Malay peninsula. The kingdom, described by Portuguese historian, Manuel Godinho de Erédia as Pam, was one of the two kingdoms of Malayos in the peninsula, in succession to Pattani, that flourished before the establishment of Melaka in the 15th century. The Pahang ruler then, titled Maharaja, was also the overlord of countries of Ujong Tanah ('land's end'), the southerly part of the peninsula including Temasek. The Majapahit chronicle, Nagarakretagama even used the name Pahang to designate the Malay peninsula, an indication of the importance of this kingdom. The History of Ming records several envoy missions from Pahang to the Ming court in the 14th and 15th centuries. In the year 1378, Maharaja Tajau sent envoys with a letter on a gold leaf and bringing as tribute six foreign slaves and products of the country. In the year 1411, during the reign of Maharaja Pa-la-mi-so-la-ta-lo-si-ni (transliterated by historian as 'Parameswara Teluk Chini'), he also sent envoys carrying tributes. The Chinese returned the favour in 1412 by sending the legendary Admiral Zheng He as an envoy to Pahang, and in the year 1414, Pahang sent tribute again to China. In the year 1416, they sent tribute together with Kozhikode and Java envoys, and in return Zheng He was again ordered to go to Pahang. =Melakan invasion= The 15th century witnessed the rise of Melaka Sultanate, which under the Sang Sapurba dynasty had aggressively consolidated its influence on the west coast of Malay peninsula. Earlier, at the end of the 13th century, the dynasty wrested the small trading outpost at Temasek from Pahang influence and established the short-lived Kingdom of Singapura which was sacked by the Javanese a century later. The renegade last king Seri Iskandar Shah established Melaka to succeed Singapura. Muzaffar Shah, the fifth Sultan of Melaka, who reigned from 1445 to 1458, refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Ligor over his country. The Ligorians, in assertion of their claim, sent an invading army led by Awi Chakri, overland to Melaka. The invaders, who were aided by Pahang auxiliaries, followed the old route by the Tembeling, Pahang and Bera rivers. They were easily defeated and fled back by the same route. Subsequently, they attempted a naval invasion, but were again beaten. Muzaffar Shah then conceived the idea of checking Ligorian pretensions by attacking the Ligor vassal state of Pahang. An expedition was organised by Muzaffar's son, Raja Abdullah and was personally led by the Melakan Bendahara Tun Perak with two hundred sail, big and small, accordingly proceeded to Pahang and conquered it in the year 1454. The reigning ruler of Pahang, Maharaja Dewa Sura, fled to the interior while his daughter Putri Wanang Seri was captured. The victors, anxious to gain the goodwill of the Bendahara, hastened in pursuit of the fugitive king until he was captured and carried together with his daughter to Melaka. In the year that Pahang was conquered, Raja Abdullah married Putri Wanang Seri, the daughter of the captive king, whose name had been changed, probably on conversion to Islam, to Putri Lela Wangsa. By her he had two sons Raja Ahmad and Raja Muhammad. Administration Little is known on the administrative system used in Pahang, but throughout its history, several government titles are recorded. The government was headed by a 'Maharaja' (literally 'emperor') as an absolute monarch, a similar title held by its overlord in Ligor. Towards the end of the kingdom, the Maharaja was recorded by de Erédia belong to the same dynasty that ruled Ligor. A title known as Senapati was recorded in the Book of Song, a Sanskrit word literally means 'lord of the army'. The Senapati was recorded in the Chinese chronicle to had headed several envoy missions to China. Other than that, a Pahang Shahbandar was known to have ruled Temasek before the island was wrested from Pahang by the Sang Sapurba dynasty. The word Shahbandar is a title adopted from Persian that literally means 'lord of the port'. The old court name was Inderapura, and the capital has always been known as 'the town'. The pre-Melakans calling it by Sanskrit name Pura, the Malays 'Pekan', the Portuguese 'a Cidade', while the people of Rompin and Bebar described the capital as Pekan Pahang. Pura may have covered a much larger than the town known as Pekan today. In addition to modern Pekan, it appears to have comprised the land on the banks of Pahang river as far as Tanjung Langgar. Culture The culture of ancient Pahang was the result of amalgamation of various Mon-Khmer and Malayic cultures. The pre- Melakan inhabitants of the country, together with people of Isthmus region's civilisation further north, were collectively referred as 'Siamese' in the Malay Annals of Melaka Sultanate, although they were identified culturally as Malays by Portuguese historian, de Erédia. On the other hand, de Erédia adopted the term 'Siam' and applied it in a broader context, referring to the overlord of these historical 'Siamese' people, that is the Thai kingdom of Ayuthaya. This broad Portuguese application of the term was later popularised as exonym for successive Thai kingdoms by other European writers. In the classical Malay text, Hikayat Hang Tuah, it was noted that although the Pahang people regarded themselves as Malays, they spoke and sang their folk songs in an outlandish language that differs from the Malay language spoken in Melaka, which would indicate a mixture of tongues and races. The pre-Melakan Pahang people were also described by Fei Xin as the adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, on which were superimposed tantric orgies involving human sacrifices. Its influence in Pahang, though it waned with the introduction of Islam, may be traced up to the beginning of the 17th century. Economy The most important product of ancient Pahang was gold. Its auriferous mines were considered the best and the largest in the whole peninsula. It was from here that there came the gold which formed the subject of the ancient trade with Alexandria. The peninsula as a whole was known to the world as a source of the precious metal to the extent that it was proclaimed Chrysḗ Chersónēsos (the golden peninsula) by Ptolemy. According to Fei Xin, Pahang also produced rice, salt which was made by boiling the sea water, and wine by fermenting the sap of the coconut tree. Fei Xin also mentioned on rare and valuable forest products like camphor barus, olibanum, agarwood, sandalwood, sapanwood, pepper and many others. Pahang, in turn, imported silver, coloured silk, Java cloth, copper and ironware, gongs and boards.

Originally marketed as a variant of the Jeep Wagoneer, the Cherokee has evolved from a full-size SUV to one of the first compact SUVs and into its current generation as a crossover SUV. Named after the Cherokee tribe of North American Indians, Jeep has used the nameplate in some capacity since 1974. Models: * Jeep Cherokee (SJ) (Model years 1974–1983) * Jeep Cherokee (XJ) (Model years 1984–2001) * Jeep Cherokee (KJ) (Model years 2002–07), also known as the Jeep Liberty in North America * Jeep Cherokee (KK) (Model years 2008–13), also known as the Jeep Liberty in North America * Jeep Cherokee (KL) (Model years 2014–present) * Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ), (WJ), (WK), and (WK2) (Model years 1993–present) Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ) (Model years 1993–1998)  Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ) (Model years 1999–2004)  Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK) (Model years 2005–2010)  Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) (Model years 2011–present) First generation (SJ) 1974 Jeep Cherokee S (US) The Cherokee was a rebadged reintroduction of a two-door body style Jeep Wagoneer, with a redesigned greenhouse that eliminated the car's C-pillar. Instead the Cherokee sported a much wider D-pillar and a single, long fixed rear side window with an optional flip-out section. Previously, a two-door version had been available in the Jeep Wagoneer line (from 1963 to 1967), although this had the same pillar and window configuration as the four-door Wagoneer. The Cherokee replaced the Jeepster Commando, whose sales had not met expectations despite an extensive 1972 revamp. The Cherokee appealed to a younger market than the Wagoneer, which was regarded more as a family SUV. The Cherokee was marketed as the \\"sporty\\" two-door variant of Jeep's station wagon that went beyond the CJ-5 in room with off-road ability. The term \\"sport(s) utility vehicle\\" appears for the first time in the 1974 Cherokee sales brochure. A four-door was not added to the lineup until 1977. Other than the base model, the trim levels of the Cherokee included the S (Sport), Chief, Golden Eagle, Golden Hawk, Limited, Classic, Sport, Pioneer, and Laredo. Second generation (XJ) 1984– 2001 Jeep Cherokee 2-door While the Wagoneer continued in production for another eight years as the Grand Wagoneer, the Cherokee nameplate was moved to a new platform for 1984. Without a traditional body-on-frame chassis, the Cherokee instead featured a light-weight unibody design. This generation Cherokee would eventually be well-known as an innovator of the modern SUV, as it spawned competitors as other automakers began to notice that this Jeep design began replacing regular cars. It also began to supplant the role of the station wagon and \\"transformed from truck to limousine in the eyes of countless suburban owners.\\" The XJ is a \\"significant link in the evolution of the 4x4.\\" It would prove to be so popular that the second generation Cherokee's replacement was released as a separate vehicle altogether as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, itself starting a successive line of vehicles as Jeep's flagship vehicle. Third generation (KJ) 2003 Jeep Cherokee Limited Edition wagon (Australia) The third generation, marketed as the Jeep Liberty in North America to differentiate it from the Grand Cherokee, was introduced in April 2001 for the 2002 model year. It was sold as the Jeep Cherokee in markets outside of North America. The Cherokee was priced between the Wrangler and Grand Cherokee. It remained the smallest of the 4-door Jeep SUVs up until the crossover-based 4-door Compass and Patriot arrived for 2007. The Cherokee featured unibody-construction. It was assembled at the Toledo North Assembly Plant in the United States, as well as in other countries including Egypt and Venezuela. It was the first Jeep vehicle to use rack and pinion steering. It was also the first Jeep to use the two then-new PowerTech engines; the 2.4 L straight-4, which was discontinued in 2006, and the 3.7 L V6. However, the Cherokee was not the first Jeep vehicle to use an independent front suspension, as the Wagoneer first used it in the 1963 model. But, that independent front suspension was limited to four wheel drive versions and, even then, was a short lived option. Fourth generation (KK) Jeep Cherokee Liberty (US) Still using the Jeep Liberty name in North America, the Cherokee was redesigned in 2008. For the first time, a rebadged version of a Jeep model existed, as Dodge sold this version of the Cherokee as the Dodge Nitro during the same time period as the fourth-generation Cherokee. It was eventually discontinued both due to slow sales as well as Sergio Marchionne wanting to avoid duplicated vehicles with Dodge and Jeep (as well as Chrysler) sharing the same sales network. With the smaller Patriot and Compass now available to cater to MPG-conscious buyers, the four-cylinder engine was dropped from the Cherokee's offerings. The iron-block, aluminium-head V6 was the only engine available for 2008. Towing capacity was . Jeep discontinued the Cherokee's CRD for the American market because it couldn't meet tougher 2007 emissions standards for diesel engines. Transmission choices were both carry-overs: a six-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Standard equipment included electronic stability control with roll mitigation, traction control, and anti- lock brakes with brake assist. New Features included standard side airbags. Optional features are rain-sensing wipers, Sirius Satellite Radio, Bluetooth, a navigation system, and the MyGig entertainment system, complete with a 30GB hard drive. Fifth generation (KL) Jeep Cherokee Limited Multijet (United Kingdom) For the fifth generation, the Cherokee nameplate returned to North America as the vehicle was converted to a crossover and grew to midsize in order to make room for the Jeep Renegade below the Cherokee and Compass. It was introduced for the 2014 model year at the 2013 New York International Auto Show and the sales started in November 2013. The Cherokee is the first Jeep vehicle to be built on the Fiat Compact/Compact U.S. Wide platform, co- developed by Chrysler and Fiat. The Jeep Cherokee is built at Belvidere Assembly Plant in Belvidere, Illinois. The Cherokee has a highway fuel economy rating of and a 45% better fuel economy rating than the Liberty/Cherokee it replaced. In 2019 the front end was updated and a new 2.0L turbo engine became available, with 270 hp and 295 lb.ft. of torque, complementing the 3.2L V-6 a 2.4L inline-4.

Like other vittarioids, ferns in the genus are epiphytes with simple, straplike leaves. They are native to tropical Africa and islands of the Indian Ocean. The presence of a midrib in their leaves, the shape of their spores, and the shape of cells at the tip of their paraphyses (minute hairs on the spore-bearing structures) help to distinguish members of the genus from other vittarioids. The group was raised to the level of genus in 2016. Description Like most other vittarioid ferns, members of the genus have simple, straplike leaves. The rhizome has a distinct upper and lower side, lacking radial symmetry. Leaves are borne in two ranks in a single plane and lack a costa (midrib), unlike Scoliosorus. The leaves have netlike venation, with three or more rows of areolae (\\"gaps\\" in the net of veins) on either side of the midline, with the exception of A. bivittata, which has two to three freely branching veins. Sori follow the veins, forming a network in those species with netlike venation. The sori bear paraphyses (minute hairs) with spherical cells at the tip. Spores are monolete, unlike Antrophyum sensu stricto, which has trilete spores. Taxonomy Three species are presently known from the genus: *Antrophyopsis bivittata (C. Chr.) Schuett. *Antrophyopsis boryana (Willd.) Schuett. *Antrophyopsis manniana (Hook.) Schuett. The genus was originally defined in 1907 by Ralph C. Benedict as a subgenus of a (broadly defined) Antrophyum, typified by Antrophyum boryanum and including three other species (since reduced to two varieties of Antrophyopsis boryana and the species A. manniana). Benedict noted that the subgenus was distinguished by sori not sunken into the leaf, forming a complete reticulate network, monolete (\\"diplanate\\") spores, bulging tips on the paraphyses on the sori, and bumpy cell walls on the scales of the stipe. The first molecular phylogenetic study of the vittarioids, by Edmund H. Crane, found Antrophyum boryanum to be sister to Scoliosorus ensiformis. As both species share monolete spores, Crane transferred A. boryanum and A. mannianum to Scoliosorus. A more extensive phylogeny using multiple chloroplast markers, published in 2016 by Eric Schuettpelz et al., placed these species together with A. bivittatum in a clade sister to the rest of Antrophyum and distant from Scoliosorus. In light of their distinctive spore morphology and geographic distribution when compared to the remainder of Antrophyum, Schuettpelz raised the subgenus to genus level, incorporating the three aforementioned species. Distribution Members of the genus are found in tropical Africa and islands of the Indian Ocean.

History Nicholls was born in England and received his theological training at Hackney College, London, under Rev. Samuel McCall. His first charge was the Congregationalist church at Dedham, Essex, where he served for fourteen years. He emigrated to South Australia where he served the Clayton Congregationalist Church from 1891 to 1903, then resigned and took over the pastorate of the Presbyterian Church in Canterbury, Victoria, where he gained a reputation as a progressive thinker and fearless teacher. \\"progressive and fearless\\" sounds like a euphemism for reactionary and abrasive. He left the Canterbury church around 1918 without fanfare and retired to New South Wales, where he died at his home in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse. Recognition At the south end of the Clayton Church is a stained glass window erected to his memory, a copy of the famous Light of the World painting by William Holman Hunt. Family Nicholls married twice, to school principal Emma Margaret Barber ( – 2 December 1905), by whom he had four sons and a daughter (all born in Dedham), and to Caroline May Bramley, née Barber (1854 – 18 March 1938), widow of James Bramley of Yorkshire and Emma's younger sister,Helen Carnegie, The Barber Chronicles p.121, available through Google Play Books on 5 December 1908.

According to India, the operation took place in Myanmar and it was in response to ambush of Indian Army convoy of 6 Dogra Regiment in Chandel district of Manipur. Indian officials said that they had crossed the border and inflicted significant casualties against the NSCN-K. According to Indian media reports, around 38 insurgents belonging to NSCN-K were killed during the operation. The operation lasted around 40 minutes. Myanmar government, however, denied the occurrence of the operation. According to Myanmar government officials, the operation against NSCN-K insurgents took place entirely on Indian side of the border and Indian troops did not cross Myanmar's border. NSCN-K also denied it. According to NSCN-K, Indian troops did not attack any camp belonging to NSCN-K and the group did not suffer any loss. NSCN-K also challenged Indian Army to display the dead bodies of those killed during the operation.  Cross-border raid details  Based on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 PARA (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the India–Myanmar border and destroyed two Militant camps one each of NSCN (K) and KYKL, along the India–Myanmar border. The operations were carried out inside the Myanmar territory along the Nagaland and Manipur border at two locations. One of the locations is near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two transit camps of the Naga militants. Seventy-two special forces commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. They were equipped with advanced assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles. The commandos wore the uniforms of the 12 Bihar Battalion of Indian army, which was then deployed on the India–Myanmar border. Troops were divided into two groups after they fast roped from Dhruv helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least 50 kilometers before they reached the training camps. Each of the two teams were further divided into two sub-groups. While one was responsible for the direct assault, the second formed an outer ring to prevent any of insurgents from running and escaping. The actual operation (hitting the camp and destroying it) took about 40 minutes. Mi-17 helicopters of the IAF were put on standby, ready to be pressed into service to evacuate the commandos in case anything went wrong In its statement after the operation the Indian Army said it was in communication with Myanmar and that, \\"There is a history of close cooperation between our two militaries. We look forward to working with them to combat such terrorism.\\". According to Indian officials, heavy casualties were inflicted on the attackers behind the ambush on Army on 4 June, which had claimed the lives of 18 Army jawans of 6 Dogra Regiment in Chandel district of Manipur. This has been marked as the biggest attack on Indian Army after Kargil war of 1999. Casualties Initial Indian media reports indicated that around 15 to 20 insurgents belonging to NSCN-K were killed during the operation. However, Times of India, while citing unnamed source from Ministry of Home Affairs (India) claimed that more than 100 insurgents were killed during the whole operation. Later on, Indian media reports indicated that around 38 insurgents were killed during the operation. Aftermath Indian Army General Dalbir Singh claimed that the Indian troops had operated along the border with Myanmar. However, General Dalbir Singh's claims were contradicted by Indian information minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. Col Rathore claimed that Indian troops had crossed the border to hit insurgents in Myanmar. Similarly Indian Army Chief, Lieutenant General Bipin Rawat, also confirmed that Indian troops had crossed Myanmar's border to attack NSCN-K insurgents. Myanmar's government insisted that the operation did not take place on its territory and that Myanmar does not allow rebel groups to use its territory to stage attacks against foreign countries. Zaw Htay, director of Myanmar's presidential office, in a Facebook post claimed that Tatmadaw battalion belonging to Myanmar Army was sent to the location to ascertain the facts. The findings of the battalion confirmed that the operation took place on the Indian side of the territory. National Socialist Council of Nagaland Khaplang faction (NSCN-K) also challenged Indian claims. NSCN-K claimed that their camp was not targeted and they did not suffer any casualties. The group challenged Indian Army to display the bodies killed in the attack.

Brands that fall under the CircusTrix corporate umbrella include Sky Zone, Rockin’ Jump, Ryze, HighHeaven, Skywalk, 2Infinity, Gravitopia, and numerous others. History CircusTrix was founded in October 2011 by Case Lawrence, a former attorney and real estate developer from Fresno, California. Lawrence got the idea for the company after visiting a trampoline park in San Francisco with his children. The first CircusTrix park, SkyWalk, was opened near Fresno in 2011. The second park, dubbed Defy Gravity, was opened in Durham, North Carolina in mid-2012. Over the next two years CircusTrix acquired, renovated and expanded other existing parks, increasing the number of locations to over 20 in 2014. The company's exponential growth continued as they expanded the brand internationally by opening large, diverse parks in Europe and Asia under the Ryze brand name. In January 2014, CircusTrix announced that they would be expanding to the Asian market with a new trampoline park in Hong Kong. The park was opened in July 2014. The first European park was announced in September 2014 and was opened in January 2015 in Edinburgh, Scotland. By mid-2015, the company was operating 25 parks, most of which were in the United States. By the end of 2015, that number had increased to 28. Parks in South Korea, Hong Kong and Edinburgh opened between 2015 and 2016.

By the end of 2016, CircusTrix had 40 parks throughout the world; by February 2019 the number had grown to 319 parks operating, with a dozen other locations pending. In January 2017, CircusTrix closed a round of private equity funding with Palladium Equity Partners for a fee estimated to be upwards of $200 million. According to The Wall Street Journal, the investment \\"represents the first significant move by private equity in the nascent indoor recreation sector.\\" In March 2017, CircusTrix acquired trampoline park operator Rockin' Jump Holdings in a deal backed by Palladium Equity Partners. In February 2018, CircusTrix acquired the Sky Zone chain of indoor trampoline parks and family entertainment centers. After completing the Sky Zone acquisition, CircusTrix had a total of 287 facilities and nearly 16,000 employees worldwide, which made it the biggest trampoline park operator in the world.

Biography Born in Tecuci, his father Eni Șerban (later Șerbănescu) was a paharnic (cup-bearer) and a member of the minor boyar nobility; his mother was named Smaranda, and the couple had eighteen children. Theodor attended primary school in his native town, followed by high school at Academia Mihăileană in the capital Iași and then the military school in the same city. A distinguished student throughout, he entered the army as a second lieutenant of the military engineers. Having reached the rank of captain in 1869, he resigned. He re-entered the army in 1877, participating in the Romanian War of Independence as an officer with the general staff. He then worked at the War Ministry, rising to colonel and holding command posts in several garrisons (Bacău, Buzău, Brăila). He left the army for good in 1893 and mainly lived at his Vameș estate in Covurlui County. He served as prefect of Cahul County in 1876, but failed to make further inroads into political life. In 1868, Șerbănescu joined Junimea, and in 1891 was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy. He died in Brăila. His first published journalism appeared in Steaua Dunării, while his first verses ran in Ateneul Român in 1861. Other publications that ran his work include Albina Pindului, Convorbiri Literare (which championed him), Literatură și artă română, Oltul, Perseverența and Revista contimporană. Much of Șerbănescu's relatively ample poetic output remains in the magazines' pages or in manuscript form as letters and albums. His first book, Poesii, appeared posthumously in 1902. Poesii alese (1927) was edited by Eugen Lovinescu, while Poesii (1941) received commentary from his great-nephew Ion Petrovici and from Nicolae Cartojan. A polyglot, he translated poems by Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred de Musset, Heinrich Heine and Ada Negri; these feature in the 1902 volume. In 1894, he and Dimitrie C.

Description Corymbia kombolgiensis is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth creamy white to brownish bark, sometimes with rough, grey, tessellated bark on the lower part of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to elliptical leaves that are long and wide on a short petiole. Adult leaves are the same shade of slightly glossy green on both sides, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are usually arranged in leaf axils on a branched peduncle up to long, each branch of the peduncle with usually with seven, sometimes up to thirteen buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are smooth and glossy, oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in August, October and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide and thin-walled, with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Scarp gum was first formally described in 1978 by Ian Brooker and Clyde Dunlop in the journal Australian Forest Research, and was given the name Eucalyptus kombolgiensis. The type specimens were collected by Dunlop on Mount Brockman (in Kakadu National Park) in 1977. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name of this species to Corymbia kombolgiensis. The specific epithet (kombolgiensis) is a reference to the Kombolgie sandstone, where this species is common.

It is situated west of The Still Peak and east of Baby Munday Peak. The mountain is named after one of the partners in the engineering firm Foley, Welch and Stewart who built and operated the Lucky Four Mine located near the peak. Nearby peaks are also named after the other partners (Foley Peak and Welch Peak). Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, granite spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W.

Part 1: Production Techniques and the Filière Suisse.\\" History and Technology, vol 5, 1988, pp. 68. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard Whitworth thread form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots.Brooks, Randall C. \\"Standard Screw Threads for Scientific Instruments. Part 1: Production Techniques and the Filière Suisse.\\" History and Technology, vol 5, 1988, pp. 72. Thread forms with rounded or \\"radiused\\" crests and roots like the Thury and Whitworth thread generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger stress riser can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation.Stachiw, Jerry D.

Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size \\"0\\" being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size \\"1\\" is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size \\"0\\", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size \\"0\\".

The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard screw gauge, where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the Whitworth thread standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard.Whitworth, Sir Joseph, et al. \\"Report of the Committee...appointed for the purpose of determining a Gauge for the manufacture of the various small screws used in Telegraphic and Electrical Apparatus, in Clockwork, and for other analogous purposes.\\" Report of the Fifty-Second Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Sciences; Held at Southampton in August 1882, pp. 311-314. https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha83brit However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest thousandth of an inch.Brooks, Randall C. \\"Standard Screw Threads for Scientific Instruments. Part 2: The British Association Screw Gauge.\\" History and Technology, vol 6, 1988, pp. 48  Obsolescence  Despite being a popular screw standards for nearly a century,Brooks, Randall C. \\"Standard Screw Threads for Scientific Instruments. Part 2: The British Association Screw Gauge.\\" History and Technology, vol 6, 1988, pp. 58. both the Thury thread and the BA thread have largely been replaced by the ISO Metric thread form. Today the Thury thread is rare outside out antiques due to the relative abundance of other standard sized fasteners. For example, the British Association 0BA, the Löwenherz 6mm and ISO M6x1.0 fasteners have identical pitch and diameter to the Thury size 0 (however, they are not interchangeable because they differ in thread geometry).Burger, Josef.

History  The organization was founded in 1999 as Sportive Association of Blind and Partially Sighted of Cameroon (ASAMC).The name of the organization in French is, '. The founder was Norbert Tsoungui, who was the first president of the organization. In 2011, ASAMC changed its name to Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Visually Impaired and the Disabled.

This was seen by the government as an important step in promoting physical activity for people with disabilities in the country. This legislation was followed up by Law No. 2011-18 of 15 July 2011 related to the organization and promotion of Physical and Sporting Activities. The law resulted in the dissolution of FECASH in July 2011. FECASH was replaced by FECASDEV, the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Physically Disabled (FECASDEP),The name of the organization in French is, '. the Cameroonian Federation of Sports the Intellectually Disabled (FECASDI)The name of the organization in French is, '. and the Cameroonian Sports Federation for the Deaf (FECASSO).The name of the organization in French is, '. These four organizations were then made members of the newly reformed Cameroonian Paralympic Committee. The process that formally dissolved FECASH and saw the formal government recognition of this organization in that new context started in March 2011, building on the work from April 2010. One of the major sources of funding for FECASDEV had been Fakkel 2000. Starting in the second half of 2011, Fakkel 2000 decided to refocus their strategy from all sport for the blind to non-competitive sport for blind children. As part of this change in strategy, they went through all their financial documents related to the various organizations they supported including FECASDEV starting around 2013. After finding irregularities, Fakkel 2000 contacted three leagues who Fakkel 2000 funds from FECASDEV should have gone to. These leagues reported not being paid or being paid less than they were owed, with irregularities totaling 515,000 XOF (USD$). Despite Fakkel 2000 bringing these issues and other alleged theft concerns to FECASDEV's attention, FECASDEV allegedly did not pay back the money to Fakkel 2000 to address the irregularies or change their budget to reflect less promised funding from Fakkel 2000. Fakkel 2000 concluded in 2013 that as FECASDEV had always been about competitive sport, they were under pressure to keep their funding from Fekkal even if they were no longer eligible because of their own financial issues. In 2014, Fakkel 2000 suspended their financial support of FECASDEV. At the time of the suspension of funds, they had been providing the organization with an annual grant of 2,620,000 XOF (USD$). In 2016, Tsoungui and CNPC President Jean Jacques Ndoudoumou were accused by members of Cameroon's national blind football team of making commitments on their behalf without consulting the team. The accusations were made as part of broader issues with the squad over lack of payment for their silver medal finish at the 2015 IBSA African Blind Football Championships.  Competitions  FECASDEV has regularly organized a goalball leagues in the country, and supported a national clubs championship at the conclusion of the season. FECASDEV was involved with organizing the 2015 IBSA Blind Football African Championship in October of that year in Douala, assisted by the IBSA.

It is a ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and white flowers on a tall spike. Description Caladenia attenuata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf. The flowers are less than in diameter and are borne on a spike up to high. The flowers are white with a dorsal sepal that curves forwards, forming a hood over the column. The mid-lobe of the labellum has a smooth edge but the surface is wrinkled. Flowering occurs in October and November. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described by William Brinsley in 1964 and given the name Caladenia carnea var. attenuata. The description was based on a plant collected from near Duramana, north of Bathurst and was published in The Orchadian. In 2000, David L. Jones raised it to species status. The specific epithet (attenuata) is a Latin word meaning \\"drawn out\\", \\"tapered\\" or \\"thin\\". Distribution and habitat When Brinsley described the species, he noted that \\"considerable numbers of flowering specimens were seen over a fairly restricted area\\" at the type location in 1964. Subsequent searches of the area and nearby habitat have failed to find any specimens. More recently, the only sighting has been a single specimen was found near Ilford in 1972 and a further possible sighting in the same area in 2013. The population size is therefore considered to be extremely low. Both sites where the orchids have been seen in the past are subject to grazing by cattle and rabbits.

The history of underwater diving starts with freediving as a widespread means of hunting and gathering, both for food and other valuable resources such as pearls and coral, By classical Greek and Roman times commercial applications such as sponge diving and marine salvage were established, Military diving also has a long history, going back at least as far as the Peloponnesian War, with recreational and sporting applications being a recent development. Technological development in ambient pressure diving started with stone weights (skandalopetra) for fast descent. In the 16th and 17th centuries diving bells became functionally useful when a renewable supply of air could be provided to the diver at depth, and progressed to surface supplied diving helmets - in effect miniature diving bells covering the diver's head and supplied with compressed air by manually operated pumps - which were improved by attaching a waterproof suit to the helmet and in the early 19th century became the standard diving dress. Limitations in mobility of the surface supplied systems encouraged the development of both open circuit and closed circuit scuba in the 20th century, which allow the diver a much greater autonomy. These also became popular during World War II for clandestine military operations, and post-war for scientific, search and rescue, media diving, recreational and technical diving. The heavy free-flow surface supplied copper helmets evolved into lightweight demand helmets, which are more economical with breathing gas, which is particularly important for deeper dives and expensive helium based breathing mixtures, and saturation diving reduced the risks of decompression sickness for deep and long exposures. An alternative approach was the development of the \\"single atmosphere\\" or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of great mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles. Although the pathophysiology of decompression sickness in not yet fully understood, decompression practice has reached a stage where the risk is fairly low, and most incidences are successfully treated by therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Mixed breathing gases are routinely used to reduce the effects of the hyperbaric environment on ambient pressure divers. Freediving Natural sponges have been harvested by free divers near the Greek island of Kalymnos since at least the time of Plato. Underwater diving was practiced in ancient cultures to gather food and other valuable resources such as pearls and precious coral, and later to reclaim sunken valuables, and to help aid military campaigns. Breathhold diving was the only method available, occasionally using reed snorkels in shallow water, and stone weights for deeper dives Underwater diving for commercial purposes may have begun in Ancient Greece, since both Plato and Homer mention the sponge as being used for bathing. The island of Kalymnos was a main centre of diving for sponges. By using weights (skandalopetra) of as much as to speed the descent, breath-holding divers would descend to depths up to for as much as five minutes to collect sponges. Sponges were not the only valuable harvest to be found on the sea floor; the harvesting of red coral was also quite popular. A variety of valuable shells or fish could be harvested in this way, creating a demand for divers to harvest the treasures of the sea, which could also include the sunken riches of other seafarers. The Mediterranean Sea had large amounts of sea trade. As a result, there were many shipwrecks, so divers were often hired to salvage whatever they could from the seabed. Divers would swim down to the wreck and choose the pieces to salvage. Divers were also used in warfare. They could be used for underwater reconnaissance when ships were approaching an enemy harbor, and if underwater defenses were found, the divers would disassemble them if possible. During the Peloponnesian War, divers were used to get past enemy blockades to relay messages and provide supplies to allies or troops that were cut off by the blockade. These divers and swimmers were occasionally used as saboteurs, drilling holes in enemy hulls, cutting ships rigging and mooring lines. In Japan, the Ama divers began to collect pearls about 2,000 years ago. Free-diving was the primary source of income for many Persian Gulf nationals such as Qataris, Emiratis, and Bahrainis and Kuwaitis. As a result, Qatari, Emirati and Bahraini heritage promoters have popularized recreational and serious events associated with freediving, underwater equipment and related activities such as snorkeling. Diving bells Illustration of an occupied diving bell. The diving bell is one of the earliest types of equipment for underwater work and exploration. Its use was first described by Aristotle in the 4th century BC: \\"...they enable the divers to respire equally well by letting down a cauldron, for this does not fill with water, but retains the air, for it is forced straight down into the water.\\" According to Roger Bacon, Alexander the Great explored the Mediterranean on the authority of Ethicus the astronomer. The earliest applications were probably for commercial sponge fishing. Diving bells were developed in the 16th and 17th century as the first significant mechanical aid to underwater diving. They were rigid chambers lowered into the water and ballasted to remain upright in the water and to sink even when full of air. The first reliably recorded use of a diving bell was by Guglielmo de Lorena in 1535 to explore Caligula's barges in Lake Nemi. In 1616, Franz Kessler built an improved diving bell. Sir William Phipps used a diving bell to salvage tremendous wealth from a sunken Spanish treasure ship. In 1658, Albrecht von Treileben was contracted by King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to salvage the warship , which sank outside Stockholm harbor in about of water on its maiden voyage in 1628. Between 1663 and 1665 von Treileben's divers were successful in raising most of the cannon, working from a diving bell with an estimated free air capacity of about for periods of about 15 minutes at a time in dark water with a temperature of about . In late 1686, Sir William Phipps convinced investors to fund an expedition to what is now Haiti and the Dominican Republic to find sunken treasure, despite the location of the shipwreck being based entirely on rumor and speculation. In January 1687, Phipps found the wreck of the Spanish galleon Nuestra Señora de la Concepción off the coast of Santo Domingo. Some sources say they used an inverted container as a diving bell for the salvage operation while others say the crew was assisted by Indian divers in the shallow waters. The operation lasted from February to April 1687 during which time they salvaged jewels, some gold and 30 tons of silver which, at the time, was worth over £200,000. In 1691, Edmond Halley completed plans for a greatly improved diving bell, capable of remaining submerged for extended periods of time, and fitted with a window for the purpose of undersea exploration. The atmosphere was replenished by way of weighted barrels of air sent down from the surface. In a demonstration, Halley and five companions dived to in the River Thames, and remained there for over an hour and a half. Improvements made to it over time, extended his underwater exposure time to over four hours. In 1775, Charles Spalding, an Edinburgh confectioner, improved on Edmond Halley's design by adding a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signaling to the surface crew. Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, later suffocated off the coast of Dublin in 1783 doing salvage work in a diving bell of Spalding's design. In 1689, Denis Papin had suggested that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a force pump or bellows. His idea was implemented exactly 100 years later by the engineer John Smeaton who built the first workable diving air pump in 1789. Surface supplied diving suits John Lethbridge's diving dress built in the 1710s. In 1602, the Spanish military engineer Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont developed the first documented diving dress. It was tested the same year in the Pisuerga river (Valladolid, Spain). King Philip the Third attended the demonstration. Two English inventors developed diving suits in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. After testing this machine in his garden pond specially built for the purpose, Lethbridge dived on a number of wrecks: four English men-of-war, one East Indiaman, two Spanish galleons and a number of galleys. He became very wealthy as a result of his salvages. One of his better-known recoveries was on the Dutch Slot ter Hooge, which had sunk off Madeira with over three tons of silver on board. At the same time, Andrew Becker created a leather-covered diving suit with a windowed helmet. The suit used a system of tubes for inhaling and exhaling, and Becker demonstrated his suit in the River Thames at London, during which he remained submerged for an hour. These suits were of limited use as there was still no practical system for replenishing the air supply during the dive. = Open diving dress = 1842 sketch of the Deane brothers' diving helmet Standard diving dress In 1405, Konrad Kyeser described a diving dress made of a leather jacket and metal helmet with two glass windows. The jacket and helmet were lined by sponge to \\"retain the air\\" and a leather pipe was connected to a bag of air. A diving suit design was illustrated in a book by Vegetius in 1511. Borelli designed diving equipment that consisted of a metal helmet, a pipe to \\"regenerate\\" air, a leather suit, and a means of controlling the diver's buoyancy. In 1690, Thames Divers, a short-lived London diving company, gave public demonstrations of a Vegetius type shallow water diving dress. Klingert designed a full diving dress in 1797. This design consisted of a large metal helmet and similarly large metal belt connected by leather jacket and pants. In 1800, presented his diving apparatus to the Swedish king, and used it successfully. In 1819 Augustus Siebe invented an open diving suit which only covered the top portion of the body. The suit included a metal helmet which was riveted to a waterproof jacket that ended below the diver's waist. The suit worked like a diving bell - air pumped into the suit escaped at the bottom edge. The diver was extremely limited in range of motion and had to move about in a more or less upright position. It wasn't until 1837 that Siebe changed the design to a closed system with only the hands left out of the suit with an air-tight encasing around the wrists. The first successful diving helmets were produced by the brothers Charles and John Deane in the 1820s. Inspired by a fire accident he witnessed in a stable in England, he designed and patented a \\"Smoke Helmet\\" to be used by firemen in smoke-filled areas in 1823. The apparatus comprised a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached to the rear of the helmet was to be used to supply air - the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed excess air to escape. The garment was constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps. The brothers had insufficient funds to build the equipment themselves so they sold the patent to their employer Edward Barnard. It was not until 1827 that the first smoke helmets were built by German-born British engineer Augustus Siebe. In 1828 they decided to find another application for their device and converted it into a diving helmet. They marketed the helmet with a loosely attached \\"diving suit\\" so that a diver could perform salvage work but only in a full vertical position, otherwise water entered the suit. Siebe's improved design in 1873. In 1829, the Deane brothers sailed from Whitstable for trials of their new underwater apparatus, establishing the diving industry in the town. In 1834, Charles used his diving helmet and suit in a successful attempt on the wreck of at Spithead, during which he recovered 28 of the ship's cannon. In 1836, John Deane recovered from the shipwreck timbers, guns, longbows, and other items. By 1836, the Deane brothers had produced the world's first diving manual Method of Using Deane's Patent Diving Apparatus which explained in detail the workings of the apparatus and pump, as well as safety precautions. =Standard diving dress= In the 1830s, the Deane brothers asked Augustus Siebe to improve their underwater helmet design. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. Siebe introduced various modifications on his diving dress design to accommodate the requirements of the salvage team on the wreck of Royal George, including making the bonnet of the helmet detachable from the corselet. His improved design gave rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving. The watertight suit allowed divers to wear layers of dry clothing undernrath to suit the water temperature. These generally included heavy stockings, guernseys, and the iconic woolen cap that is still occasionally worn by divers. = Early diving work = In the early years of the diving suit, divers were often employed for cleaning and maintenance of seagoing vessels which could require the efforts of multiple divers. Ships that did not have diving suits available would commission diving companies to do underwater maintenance of ships hulls as a clean hull would increase the speed of the vessel. The average time spent diving for these purposes was between 4 and 7 hours. The Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs adopted the diving suit in the 1860s. Divers duties included underwater repair of vessels, maintenance and cleaning of propellers, retrieval of lost anchors and chains, and removing seaweed and other fouling from the hull that could hinder movement.  Development of salvage diving operations  Sinking of Royal George, a 100-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, sank undergoing routine maintenance work in 1782. Charles Spalding used a diving bell to recover six iron 12-pounder guns and nine brass 12-pounders in the same year. In 1839 Major-General Charles Pasley, at the time a colonel of the Royal Engineers, commenced operations. He had previously destroyed some old wrecks in the Thames and intended to break up Royal George with gunpowder charges and then salvage as much as possible using divers. The Deane brothers were commissioned to perform salvage work on the wreck. Using their new air-pumped diving helmets, they managed to recover about two dozen cannon. Pasley's diving salvage operation set many diving milestones, including the first recorded use of the buddy system in diving, when he gave instructions to his divers to operate in pairs. In addition, the first emergency swimming ascent was made by a diver after his air line became tangled and he had to cut it free. A less fortunate milestone was the first medical account of a diving barotrauma. The early diving helmets had no non-return valves, so if a hose was severed near the surface, the ambient pressure air around the diver's head rapidly drained from the helmet to the lower pressure at the break, leaving a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the helmet that could cause injurious and sometimes life-threatening effects. At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Sir John Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations. Pasley recovered 12 more guns in 1839, 11 more in 1840, and 6 in 1841. In 1842 he recovered only one iron 12-pounder because he ordered the divers to concentrate on removing the hull timbers rather than search for guns. Other items recovered, in 1840, included the surgeon's brass instruments, silk garments of satin weave \\"of which the silk was perfect\\", and pieces of leather; but no woollen clothing. By 1843 the whole of the keel and the bottom timbers had been raised and the site was declared clear. Self-contained air supply equipment A drawback to the equipment pioneered by Deane and Siebe was the requirement for a constant supply of air pumped from the surface. This restricted the movements and range of the diver and was also potentially hazardous as the supply could get cut off for a number of reasons. Early attempts at creating systems that would allow divers to carry a portable breathing gas source did not succeed, as the compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures. By the end of the nineteenth century, two basic templates for scuba, (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus), had emerged; open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaust is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the diver's unused oxygen is filtered from the carbon dioxide and recirculated. A scuba set is characterized by full independence from the surface during use, by providing breathing gas carried by the diver. Early attempts to reach this autonomy from the surface were made in the 18th century by the Englishman John Lethbridge, who invented and successfully built his own underwater diving machine in 1715. The air inside the suit allowed a short period of diving before it had to be surfaced for replenishment. =Open-circuit scuba= None of those inventions solved the problem of high pressure when compressed air must be supplied to the diver (as in modern regulators); they were mostly based on a constant-flow supply of the air. The compression and storage technology was not advanced enough to allow compressed air to be stored in containers at sufficiently high pressures to allow useful dive times. An early diving dress using a compressed air reservoir was designed and built in 1771 by Sieur Fréminet of Paris who conceived an autonomous breathing machine equipped with a reservoir, dragged behind the diver or mounted on his back. Fréminet called his invention machine hydrostatergatique and used it successfully for more than ten years in the harbors of Le Havre and Brest, as stated in the explanatory text of a 1784 painting. The Frenchman Paul Lemaire d'Augerville built and used autonomous diving equipment in 1824, as did the British William H. James in 1825. James' helmet was made of \\"thin copper or sole of leather\\" with a plate window, and the air was supplied from an iron reservoir. A similar system was used in 1831 by the American Charles Condert, who died in 1832 while testing his invention in the East River at only deep. After having travelled to England and discovering William James' invention, the French physician Manuel Théodore Guillaumet, from Argentan (in Normandy), patented the oldest known regulator mechanism in 1838. Guillaumet's invention was air-supplied from the surface and was never mass-produced due to problems with safety. The Rouquayrol-Denayrouze apparatus was the first regulator to be mass-produced (from 1865 to 1965). In this picture the air reservoir presents its surface-supplied configuration. Divers dressed in the Apparatus Invented by MM Rouquayrol and Denayrouze An important step in the development of open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the demand regulator in 1864 by the French engineers Auguste Denayrouze and Benoît Rouquayrol. Their suit was the first to supply air to the user by adjusting the flow according to the diver's requirements. The system still had to use surface supply, as the storage cylinders of the 1860s were not able to withstand the high pressures necessary for a practical self-contained unit. The first open-circuit scuba system was devised in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France. Inspired by the simple apparatus of Maurice Fernez and the freedom it allowed the diver, he conceived an idea to make it free of the tube to the surface pump by using Michelin cylinders as the air supply, containing of air compressed to . The \\"Fernez-Le Prieur\\" diving apparatus was demonstrated at the swimming pool of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried on the back of the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continually to the mouthpiece and ejected through a short exhaust pipe fitted with a valve as in the Fernez design, however, the lack of a demand regulator and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of Le Prieur's device. Le Prieur's design was the first autonomous breathing device used by the first scuba diving clubs in history - Racleurs de fond founded by Glenn Orr in California in 1933, and Club des sous-l'eau founded by Le Prieur himself in Paris in 1935. Fernez had previously invented the noseclip, a mouthpiece (equipped with a one-way valve for exhalation) and diving goggles, and Yves le Prieur just joined to those three Fernez elements a hand-controlled regulator and a compressed-air cylinder. Fernez's goggles didn't allow a dive deeper than due to \\"mask squeeze\\", so, in 1933, Le Prieur replaced all the Fernez equipment (goggles, noseclip and valve) by a full face mask, directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator to use with gas generators, in response to constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, the Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943. Mistral twin-hose regulator mounted on a diving cylinder. The regulator is formed by the ensemble of the mouthpiece and the regulator body, joined on each of its sides by the two hoses. The rear of the regulator is connected to the high-pressure valve of the cylinder. Air Liquide started selling the Cousteau-Gagnan regulator commercially as of 1946 under the name of scaphandre Cousteau-Gagnan or CG45 (\\"C\\" for Cousteau, \\"G\\" for Gagnan and 45 for the 1945 patent). The same year Air Liquide created a division called La Spirotechnique, to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company (the American division of Air Liquide) and later sold with La Spirotechnique and U.S. Divers to finally become the name of the company, Aqua-Lung/La Spirotechnique, currently located in Carros, near Nice. In 1948 the Cousteau-Gagnan patent was also licensed to Siebe Gorman of England, when Siebe Gorman was directed by Robert Henry Davis. Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This demand was eventually met by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration resulted in a diver passing out, he began to develop the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first and second stages by a low-pressure hose, and releases exhaled gas at the second stage. This avoided the Cousteau-Gagnan patent, which protected the twin-hose scuba regulator. In the process, Eldred also improved performance of the regulator. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952. In 1957, Eduard Admetlla i Lázaro used a version made by Nemrod to descend to a record depth of . Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back. The harnesses of many diving rebreathers made by Siebe Gorman included a large back-sheet of reinforced rubber. Early scuba divers dived without any buoyancy aid. In emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available. One early make, since 1961, was Fenzy. The ABLJ is used for two purposes: to adjust the buoyancy of the diver to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth, mainly due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit) and more importantly as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. It was put on before putting on the cylinder harness. The first versions were inflated with a small carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. An extra low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage lets the lifejacket be controlled as a buoyancy aid. This invention in 1971 of the \\"direct system,\\" by ScubaPro, resulted in what was called a stabilizer jacket or stab jacket, and is now increasingly known as a buoyancy compensator (device), or simply \\"BCD\\". =Closed-circuit scuba= Henry Fleuss (1851-1932) improved the technology of the closed circuit oxygen rebreather . The alternative concept, developed in roughly the same time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises only a part of the oxygen in the inhaled air at the surface, and an even smaller fraction when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure systems underwater. A rebreather recycles the used breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get dangerously depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress due to hypercapnia. The earliest known oxygen rebreather was patented on 17 June 1808 by Sieur Touboulic from Brest, mechanic in Napoleon's Imperial Navy, but there is no evidence of any prototype having been manufactured. This early rebreather design worked with an oxygen reservoir, the oxygen being delivered progressively by the diver himself and circulating in a closed circuit through a sponge soaked in limewater. The earliest practical rebreather relates to the 1849 patent from the Frenchman Pierre Aimable De Saint Simon Sicard. The first commercially practical closed-circuit scuba was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected by a tube to a bag, with (estimated) 50–60% O2 supplied from a copper pressure tank and CO2 chemically absorbed by rope yarn in the bag soaked in a solution of caustic potash. The system allowed use for about three hours. Fleuss tested his device in 1879 by spending an hour submerged in a water tank, then one week later by diving to a depth of in open water, upon which occasion he was slightly injured when his assistants abruptly pulled him to the surface. The Fleuss apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project Alexander Lambert, who was able to travel in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings. Fleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus being tested at the submarine escape test tank at HMS Dolphin, Gosport, 14 December 1942. Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set. The Davis apparatus comprised a rubber breathing bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled carbon dioxide and a steel cylinder holding approximately of oxygen at a pressure of , with a valve to allow the user to add oxygen to the bag. The set also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of to help keep the wearer afloat. The DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927. The rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled CO2 and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately of oxygen at a pressure of . The cylinder was equipped with a control valve and was connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on the front of to help keep the wearer afloat. The DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy after further development by Davis in 1927. In 1912 the German firm Drägerwerk of Lübeck introduced their own version of standard diving dress using a gas supply from an injector-circulated oxygen rebreather and no surface supply. Davis apparatus. In the 1930s, Italian sport spearfishers began to use the Davis rebreather. Italian manufacturers received a license from the English patent holders to produce it. This practice soon came to the attention of the Italian Navy, The Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the Decima Flottiglia MAS, especially the Pirelli ARO which was used effectively in World War II. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British used the Davis apparatus for submarine escape, but they soon adapted it for their frogmen during World War II. Germans used the Dräger rebreathers, which were also originally designed as submarine escape sets and only adapted for use by frogmen during World War II. During the Second World War, captured Italian frogmen's rebreathers influenced improved designs for British rebreathers. Some British armed forces divers used bulky thick diving suits called Sladen suits, one version of which had a flip-up faceplate to let the diver use binoculars when on the surface. In 1939, Christian Lambertsen developed an oxygen rebreather he called the Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU) and patented it in 1940. He later renamed it the Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment. Lambertson demonstrated the apparatus to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) who hired him to lead the program to build up the dive element of their maritime unit. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. Lambertsen later suggests that breathing gas mixtures of nitrogen or helium with an oxygen greater than in air could be used in scuba to increase the depth range beyond that possible using pure oxygen rebreathers, at the same time reducing the requirement for decompression. In the early 1950s, Lambertsen developed a semiclosed-circuit scuba called the FLATUS I, that continuously added a small flow of oxygen rich mixed gas to a rebreather circuit. The flow of fresh gas replenished the oxygen depleted by metabolic consumption, and exhaled carbon dioxide was removed in an absorbent canister. The added inert gas was not consumed by the diver, so this amount of gas mixture was exhausted from the breathing loop to maintain a constant volume, and an approximately constant mixture in the loop. Saturation diving Once saturation is achieved, the amount of time needed for decompression depends on the depth and gases breathed and is not affected by longer exposure. The first intentional saturation dive was done on 22 December 1938, by Edgar End and Max Nohl who spent 27 hours breathing air at 101 feet (30.8 m) in the County Emergency Hospital recompression facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Their decompression lasted five hours leaving Nohl with a mild case of decompression sickness that resolved with recompression. Albert R. Behnke proposed exposing divers to raised ambient pressures long enough for the tissues to saturate with inert gases in 1942. In 1957, George F. Bond began the Genesis project at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory proving that humans could withstand prolonged exposure to different breathing gases and increased environmental pressures. This was the beginning of saturation diving and the United States Navy's Man-in-the-Sea Program. The first commercial saturation dives were performed in 1965 by Westinghouse to replace faulty trash racks at on the Smith Mountain Dam. Peter B. Bennett is credited with the invention of trimix breathing gas as a method to eliminate high pressure nervous syndrome. In 1981, at the Duke University Medical Center, Bennett conducted an experiment called Atlantis III, which involved taking divers to a depth of , and slowly decompressing them to the surface over a period of 31-plus days, setting an early world record for depth in the process. After a pioneering period of offshore commercial saturation diving in the oil and gas production industry, in which a number of fatal accidents occurred, the technology and procedures of saturation diving have matured to the point where accidents are rare, and fatal accidents very rare. This has been the result of systematic investigation of accidents, analysis of the causes, and applying the results to improving the risks, often at considerable expense, by improving both procedures and equipment to remove single points of failure and opportunities for user error. The improvements in safety have been driven in part by national health and safety legislation, but also to a large extent have been industry driven through membership of organisations like IMCA. Atmospheric diving suits The atmospheric diving suit is a small one-man submersible of anthropomorphic form with elaborate pressure joints to allow articulation while maintaining an internal pressure of one atmosphere. Although atmospheric suits were developed during the Victorian era, none of these suits were able to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure. =Early designs= John Lethbridge's diving dress, the first enclosed diving suit, built in the 1710s. In 1715, British inventor John Lethbridge constructed a \\"diving suit\\". Essentially a wooden barrel about in length with two holes for the diver's arms sealed with leather cuffs, and a viewport of thick glass. It was reportedly used to dive as deep as , and was used to salvage substantial quantities of silver from the wreck of the East Indiaman Vansittart which sank in 1718 off the Cape Verde islands. The first armored suit with real joints, designed as leather pieces with rings in the shape of a spring (also known as accordion joints), was designed by Englishman W. H. Taylor in 1838. The diver's hands and feet were covered with leather. Taylor also devised a ballast tank attached to the suit that could be filled with water to attain negative buoyancy. While it was patented, the suit was never actually produced. It is considered that its weight and bulk would have rendered it nearly immobile underwater. Lodner D. Phillips designed the first wholly enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a barrel-shaped upper torso with domed ends and included ball and socket joints in the articulated arms and legs. The arms had joints at shoulder and elbow, and the legs at knee and hip. The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing port, entrance through a manhole cover on top, a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators at the ends of the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, Phillips' suit was ever constructed. ADS, built by Carmagnolle brothers in 1882, was the first anthropomorphic design. The first properly anthropomorphic design of ADS, built by the Carmagnolle brothers of Marseilles, France in 1882, featured rolling convolute joints consisting of partial sections of concentric spheres formed to create a close fit and kept watertight with a waterproof cloth. The suit had 22 of these joints: four in each leg, six per arm, and two in the body of the suit. The helmet possessed 25 individual glass viewing ports spaced at the average distance of the human eyes. Weighing , the Carmagnole ADS never worked properly and its joints never were entirely waterproof. It is now on display at the French National Navy Museum in Paris. Another design was patented in 1894 by inventors John Buchanan and Alexander Gordon from Melbourne], Australia. The construction was based on a frame of spiral wires covered with waterproof material. The design was improved by Alexander Gordon by attaching the suit to the helmet and other parts and incorporating jointed radius rods in the limbs. This resulted in a flexible suit which could withstand high pressure. The suit was manufactured by British firm Siebe Gorman and trialed in Scotland in 1898. American designer MacDuffy constructed the first suit to use ball bearings to provide joint movement in 1914; it was tested in New York to a depth of , but was not very successful. A year later, Harry L. Bowdoin of Bayonne, New Jersey, made an improved ADS with oil-filled rotary joints. The joints use a small duct to the interior of the joint to allow equalization of pressure. The suit was designed to have four joints in each arm and leg, and one joint in each thumb, for a total of eighteen. Four viewing ports and a chest-mounted lamp were intended to assist underwater vision. Unfortunately there is no evidence that Bowdoin's suit was ever built, or that it would have worked if it had been. Atmospheric diving suits built by German firm Neufeldt and Kuhnke were used during the salvage of gold and silver bullion from the wreck of the British ship , an 8,000-ton P&O; liner that sank in May 1922. The suit was relegated to duties as an observation chamber at the wreck's depth, and was successfully used to direct mechanical grabs which opened up the bullion storage. In 1917, Benjamin F. Leavitt of Traverse City, Michigan, dived on which sank to a depth of in Lake Huron in 1865, salvaging 350 tons of copper ore. In 1923, he went on to salvage the wreck of the British schooner Cape Horn which lay in of water off Pichidangui, Chile, salvaging $600,000 worth of copper. Leavitt's suit was of his own design and construction. The most innovative aspect of Leavitt's suit was the fact that it was completely self-contained and needed no umbilical, the breathing mixture being supplied from a tank mounted on the back of the suit. The breathing apparatus incorporated a scrubber and an oxygen regulator and could last for up to a full hour. In 1924 the Reichsmarine tested the second generation of the Neufeldt and Kuhnke suit to , but limb movement was very difficult and the joints were judged not to be fail-safe, in that if they were to fail, there was a possibility that the suit's integrity would be violated. However, these suits were used by the Germans as armored divers during World War II and were later taken by the Western Allies after the war. In 1952, Alfred A. Mikalow constructed an ADS employing ball and socket joints, specifically for the purpose of locating and salvaging sunken treasure. The suit was reportedly capable of diving to depths of and was used successfully to dive on the sunken vessel in of water near Fort Point, San Francisco. Mikalow's suit had various interchangeable instruments which could be mounted on the end of the arms in place of the usual manipulators. It carried seven 90-cubic foot high pressure cylinders to provide breathing gas and control buoyancy. The ballast compartment covered the gas cylinders. For communication, the suit used hydrophones. =Peress' Tritonia= Two divers, one wearing the \\"Tritonia\\" ADS and the other standard diving dress, preparing to explore the wreck of , 1935. Although various atmospheric suits had been developed during the Victorian era, none of these suits had been able to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure. Pioneering British diving engineer, Joseph Salim Peress, invented the first truly usable atmospheric diving suit, the Tritonia, in 1932 and was later involved in the construction of the famous JIM suit. Having a natural talent for engineering design, he challenged himself to construct an ADS that would keep divers dry and at atmospheric pressure, even at great depth. In 1918, Peress began working for WG Tarrant at Byfleet, United Kingdom, where he was given the space and tools to develop his ideas about constructing an ADS. His first attempt was an immensely complex prototype machined from solid stainless steel. In 1923, Peress was asked to design a suit for salvage work on the wreck of SS Egypt which had sunk in the English Channel. He declined, on the grounds that his prototype suit was too heavy for a diver to handle easily, but was encouraged by the request to begin work on a new suit using lighter materials. By 1929 he believed he had solved the weight problem, by using cast magnesium instead of steel, and had also managed to improve the design of the suit's joints by using a trapped cushion of oil to keep the surfaces moving smoothly. The oil, which was virtually non- compressible and readily displaceable, would allow the limb joints to move freely at depths of , where the pressure was . Peress claimed that the Tritonia suit could function at although this was never proven. In 1930, Peress revealed the Tritonia suit. By May it had completed trials and was publicly demonstrated in a tank at Byfleet. In September Peress' assistant Jim Jarret dived in the suit to a depth of in Loch Ness. The suit performed perfectly, the joints proving resistant to pressure and moving freely even at depth. The suit was offered to the Royal Navy which turned it down, stating that Navy divers never needed to descend below . In October 1935 Jarret made a successful deep dive to more than on the wreck of off south Ireland, followed by a shallower dive to in the English Channel in 1937 after which, due to lack of interest, the Tritonia suit was retired. The development in atmospheric pressure suits stagnated in the 1940s through 1960s, as efforts were concentrated on solving the problems of deep diving by dealing with the physiological problems of ambient pressure diving instead of avoiding them by isolating the diver from the pressure. Although the advances in ambient pressure diving (in particular, with scuba gear) were significant, the limitations brought renewed interest to the development of the ADS in the late 1960s. =The JIM suit= The Tritonia suit spent about 30 years in an engineering company's warehouse in Glasgow, where it was discovered, with Peress' help, by two partners in the British firm Underwater Marine Equipment, Mike Humphrey and Mike Borrow, in the mid-1960s. UMEL would later classify Peress' suit as the \\"A.D.S Type I\\", a designation system that would be continued by the company for later models. In 1969, Peress was asked to become a consultant to the new company created to develop the JIM suit, named in honour of the diver Jim Jarret. A JIM suit on display at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum, Gosport The Tritonia suit was upgraded into the first JIM suit, completed in November 1971. This suit underwent trials aboard in early 1972, and in 1976, the JIM suit set a record for the longest working dive below , lasting five hours and 59 minutes at a depth of . The first JIM suits were constructed from cast magnesium for its high strength-to-weight ratio and weighed approximately in air including the diver. They were in height and had a maximum operating depth of . The suit had a positive buoyancy of . Ballast was attached to the suit's front and could be jettisoned from within, allowing the operator to ascend to the surface at approximately per minute. The suit also incorporated a communication link and a jettisonable umbilical connection. The original JIM suit had eight annular oil-supported universal joints, one in each shoulder and lower arm, and one at each hip and knee. The JIM operator received air through an oral/nasal mask that attached to a lung- powered scrubber that had a life-support duration of approximately 72 hours. Operations in arctic conditions with water temperatures of -1.7°C for over 5 hours were successfully carried out using woolen thermal protection and neoprene boots. In 30°C water the suit was reported to be uncomfortably hot during heavy work. As technology improved and operational knowledge grew, Oceaneering upgraded their fleet of JIMs. The magnesium construction was replaced with glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) and the single joints with segmented ones, each allowing seven degrees of motion, and when added together giving the operator a very great range of motion. In addition, the four-port domed top of the suit was replaced by a transparent acrylic one that was taken from Wasp, this allowed the operator a much-improved field of vision. Trials were also carried out by the Ministry of Defence on a flying Jim suit powered from the surface through an umbilical cable. This resulted in a hybrid suit with the ability of working on the sea bed as well as mid water. =Later developments= In addition to upgrades to the JIM design, other variations of the original suit were constructed. The first, named the SAM Suit (Designated A.D.S III), was a completely aluminium model. A smaller and lighter suit, it was more anthropomorphic than the original JIMs and was depth-rated to . Attempts were made to limit corrosion by the use of a chromic anodizing coating applied to the arm and leg joints, which gave them an unusual green color. The SAM suit stood at in height, and had a life-support duration of 20 hours. Only three SAM suits would be produced by UMEL before the design was shelved. The second, named the JAM suit (Designated A.D.S IV), was constructed of GRP and was depth-rated for around . US Navy ADS 2000 on launch and recovery platform after a certification dive in August 2006. In 1987, the \\"Newtsuit\\" was developed by the Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten. The Newtsuit is constructed to function like a \\"submarine you can wear\\", allowing the diver to work at normal atmospheric pressure even at depths of over . Made of wrought aluminium, it had fully articulated joints so the diver can move more easily underwater. The life-support system provides six to eight hours of air, with an emergency back-up supply of an additional 48 hours. The Newtsuit was used to salvage the bell from the wreck of in 1995. A more recent design by Nuytten is the Exosuit, a relatively lightweight suit intended for marine research. It was first used in 2014 at the Bluewater and Antikythera underwater research expeditions. The ADS 2000 was developed jointly with OceanWorks International and the US Navy in 1997, as an evolution of the Newtsuit to meet US Navy requirements. The ADS2000 provides increased depth capability for the US Navy's Submarine Rescue Program. Manufactured from forged T6061 aluminum alloy it uses an advanced articulating joint design based on the Newtsuit joints. Capable of operating in up to of seawater for a normal mission of up to six hours it has a self-contained, automatic life support system. Additionally, the integrated dual thruster system allows the pilot to navigate easily underwater.

File:Exosuit Side.jpgSide view of Exosuit File:Exosuit Back.jpgBack view of Exosuit Physiological discoveries This painting, An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump by Joseph Wright of Derby, 1768, depicts an experiment performed by Robert Boyle in 1660. A change in pressure may have immediate effect on the ears and sinuses, causing pain and leading to congestion, edema, hemorrhaging, and temporary to permanent hearing impairment. These effects have been familiar to breathhold divers since antiquity and are avoided by equalisation techniques. Reduction of ambient pressure during ascent can cause overpressure injury to internal gas spaces if not allowed to freely equalise. Health effects in divers include damage to the joints and bones similar to symptoms attributed to caisson disease in compressed air workers, which was found to be caused by too rapid a decompression to atmospheric pressure after long exposure to a pressurised environment When a diver descends in the water column the ambient pressure rises. Breathing gas is supplied at the same pressure as the surrounding water, and some of this gas dissolves into the diver's blood and other tissues. Inert gas continues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver's lungs, (see: \\"saturation diving\\"), or the diver moves up in the water column and reduces the ambient pressure of the breathing gas until the inert gases dissolved in the tissues are at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state, and start diffusing out again. Dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen or helium can form bubbles in the blood and tissues of the diver if the partial pressures of the dissolved gases in the diver gets too high when compared to the ambient pressure. These bubbles, and products of injury caused by the bubbles, can cause damage to tissues known as decompression sickness or the bends. The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver, and the long-term goal is to also avoid complications due to sub-clinical decompression injury. The symptoms of decompression sickness are known to be caused by damage resulting from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage. The precise mechanisms of bubble formation and the damage they cause has been the subject of medical research for a considerable time and several hypotheses have been advanced and tested. Tables and algorithms for predicting the outcome of decompression schedules for specified hyperbaric exposures have been proposed, tested, and used, and usually found to be of some use but not entirely reliable. Decompression remains a procedure with some risk, but this has been reduced and is generally considered to be acceptable for dives within the well-tested range of commercial, military and recreational diving. The first recorded experimental work related to decompression was conducted by Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed that it was possible to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness. By the late 19th century, as salvage operations became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called \\"caisson disease\\" but later the \\"bends\\" because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to stoop. Early reports of the disease had been made at the time of Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes. Early treatment methods involved returning the diver to pressurised conditions by re-immersion in the water. In 1942–43 the UK Government carried out extensive testing for oxygen toxicity in divers. French physiologist Paul Bert was the first to understand it as decompression sickness. His classical work, La Pression barometrique (1878), was a comprehensive investigation into the physiological effects of air-pressure, both above and below the normal. He determined that inhaling pressurized air caused the nitrogen to dissolve into the bloodstream; rapid depressurization would then release the nitrogen into its natural gaseous state, forming bubbles that could block the blood circulation and potentially cause paralysis or death. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity was also first described in this publication and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Paul Bert effect\\". John Scott Haldane designed a decompression chamber in 1907 to help make deep-sea divers safer and he produced the first decompression tables for the Royal Navy in 1908 after extensive experiments with animals and human subjects. These tables established a method of decompression in stages - it remains the basis for decompression methods to this day. Following Haldane's recommendation, the maximum safe operating depth for divers was extended to . Research on decompression was continued by the US Navy. The C&R; tables were published in 1915, and a large number of experimental dives done in the 1930s, which led to the 1937 tables. Surface decompression and oxygen use were also researched in the 1930s, and the US Navy 1957 tables developed to deal with problems found in the 1937 tables. In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Hills published their paper, A thermodynamic approach arising from a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression by conventional models results in bubble formation which is then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops which is slower than off-gassing while still in solution. This indicates the importance of minimizing bubble phase for efficient gas elimination. M.P. Spencer showed that doppler ultrasonic methods can detect venous bubbles in asymptomatic divers, and Andrew Pilmanis showed that safety stops reduced bubble formation. In 1981 D.E. Yount described the Varying Permeability Model, proposing a mechanism of bubble formation. Several other bubble models followed.

Bernews] Royal Naval Examination Service With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Castle Harbour was taken over by the Royal Naval Examination Service (RNXS). Ships arriving at Bermuda were obliged to stop at Five-Fathom Hole, which had been designated the Examination Anchorage. This body of water lies just within the outer reefline, and ships can travel from it directly into St. George's Harbour, or can follow Hurd's Channel around St. Catherine's Point to reach the Northern Lagoon, enclosed by the barrier reef. From here, ships can enter the Great Sound, where the North America and West Indies Station anchorage is located at Grassy Bay (east of the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island and west of Spanish Point on the Main Island, where the Admiralty House was located. The Great Sound was also the landing area used by Royal Air Force and airline flying boats operating from Darrell's Island and Fleet Air Arm seaplanes operating from the Royal Naval Air Station on Boaz Island; the US Navy began building a third flying boat air station, combined with naval docklands, the US Naval Operating Base, on the Great Sound even before the US entry into the war). During the course of the war, when Allied trans-Atlantic shipping was organised into convoys, Bermuda became a forming up point for convoys (coded BHX, these joined at sea with HX-coded convoys from Halifax to complete the passage to Europe), with large numbers of vessels anchoring on the Northern Lagoon and the Great Sound. From the Great Sound, ships could also reach Bermuda's main commercial port, the City of Hamilton, on Hamilton Harbour.Fortress Bermuda: A Visitor's Guide to the Naval and Military Heritage Sites of the Imperial Fortress Colony of Bermuda.

History In 2000, the Baosteel Group split, creating the new Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., which is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange since 12 December 2000.http://www.sse.com.cn/assortment/stock/list/info/company/index.shtml?COMPANY_CODE=600019 It was the largest initial public offering in Mainland China up to that time, raising CNY 7.7 billion despite being limited to domestic investors. It was rumoured that the company has planned to list in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in the same year. (and again in 2007) However, they were never materialized. Baoshan Iron & Steel's IPO record was broken by fellow government controlling listed company Sinopec in 2001. Nevertheless, Baoshan Iron & Steel also re-capitalize a few times to increase its share capital and market capitalization. For example, right after the IPO the share capital was CNY 12,512 million, as of 31 December 2019, it was CNY 22,274,460,375. The major assets of the listed company at that time was the steel plant located in Shanghai. However, even until today, not all of the assets of China Baowu Steel Group were injected into the listed company, for example steel plants that incorporated as Maanshan Iron & Steel Shaoguan Iron and Steel and Xinjiang Ba Yi Iron and Steel. Some of the assets were injected into another listed company Baosight Software in 2001. In 2004 Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. acquired Baosight Software from the parent company. In the same year the listed company also attempted to acquire other assets from the parent, such as Meishan Iron & Steel, as well as the \\"special steel\\" () production line of Shanghai Fifth Steel Plant. At that time, another unlisted sister company which has major connected transactions with the listed company, was Shanghai Baosteel International Economic & Trade Co. Ltd. (; \\"Baosteel International\\" () in short). Baosteel International became a wholly owned subsidiary of the listed company in 2005. A redistribution of the businesses of Baosteel International, to sister division and company was took place in 2006. In 2016, Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. merged with Wuhan Iron and Steel Company Limited in an all-share deal. Subsidiaries Baoshan Iron & Steel owned 4 major steel plants that located in Shanghai, Nanjing (in Meishan Iron Mine), Zhanjiang and Wuhan. The latter three were incorporated as a limited companies. Baoshan Iron & Steel also owned another listed company Baosight Software (SSE:600845) as well as other subsidiaries and joint ventures. =Baosight Software= Baosight Software () is a listed company that owned by Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd., which itself is a listed company since 2000.

After the capital increase as well as the withdrew of Guangzhou SASAC, the listed company owned 90% stake of Zhanjiang Iron & Steel. The first phase of the steel plant that owned by Zhanjiang Iron & Steel, is completed in 2016. =Wuhan Iron & Steel= On 21–22 September 2016, a merger between Baosteel Group and Wuhan Iron and Steel Group (WISCO) was announced. Baoshan Iron & Steel would take over the listed counterpart from Wuhan Iron and Steel Group in an all-share deal, while all the rights of Wuhan Iron and Steel Group would be transferred to Baosteel Group, as both corporations were supervised by the Central Government's SASAC. Unlike Baosteel, WISCO has a longer history which could be traced back to 1955. It was once considered as the top 3 steel plants of China, along with Ansteel Group and Baotou Steel. Before the merger, if counting both listed and unlisted portions of WISCO, it was the sixth largest steel company in China and 11th in the world as of 2015, according World Steel Association and China Iron and Steel Association. Equity investments In 2002, Baosteel invested CNY 8 billion in the third pipeline of the West–East Gas Pipeline, acquiring a 12.8% stake (the pipe was incorporated as a limited company called ). In December 2015, a new company, PetroChina Pipelines (), was formed to manage all three of the west–east pipelines, and existing share capital of the three management companies were converted into the share capital of the new company, giving Baosteel an overall 3.25% stake. Shareholders Since foundation, Baosteel Group (now called China Baowu Steel Group after a merger) is the controlling shareholder of the listed company. In turn it is owned by the Chinese Central Government. However, the ownership ratio changed from time to time. In mid-2016, Baosteel Group and China National Petroleum Corporation, both overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, formed a cross ownership arrangement for their listed subsidiaries. After the deal, Baosteel Group held a 0.34% stake in PetroChina, while China National Petroleum Corp. received a 4.86% stake in Baoshan Iron and Steel. In December 2019, Baowu transferred a further 2.19% stake of the listed company to -owned Shougang Group.

Prelude Between 1960 and 1964, the United States increased its aid to Bolivia under the Alliance for Progress by 600%, giving 205 million USD in economic aid and 23 million USD in various loans. The first 35 Peace Corps volunteers arrived in early 1962. The increase in world tin prices also helped to stabilize Bolivia’s economy, which had been near collapse during the first revolutionary presidency of Estenssoro. Between 1961 and 1965 the Bolivian GNP rose by average 5.7% annually. As successive Presidential terms were allowed by the Constitutional amendments of 1961, Estenssoro decided to run for the third term. The leftist vice-president Juan Lechin (1960-64), who himself wanted to run for president in 1964, was forced to resign as vice- president and then sent as ambassador to Italy by Esstenssoro. On December 5, 1963 left wing supporters of Lechin resigned from the government. By this time Lechin split from the MNR and formed Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left. When Estenssoro jailed several militant labour activists, miners in Catavi mines responded by seizing a group of hostages, including four US citizens. The crisis was resolved after Lechin’s mediation. This event marked a break in alliance between the Estenssoro’s MNR and miners, which had begun in 1942. The Bolivian army, which had been rebuilt and increased in size during recent years, provided an alternative power base to Estenssoro. After some hesitation, air force general Barrientos was picked by Estenssoro as his running mate for the May 1964 elections, and army became more involved in the politics. During the next six months internal unrest steadily increased, as miners went on strike and rioted. Various politicians, including Lechin, asked Barrientos to intervene. In late October Estenssoro asked the army to quell a miner uprising near Oruro. After armed clashes between the army and miners on October 28, Barrientos and Ovando decided to strike and launched their coup in November 3. The Coup The coup began early on November 3, when troops of the Ingavi regiment rebelled in La Paz. By the evening all the major military units had backed the coup and on in the afternoon of November 4 Estenssoro with his family was exiled to Lima, as Barrientos and Ovando established their junta. Some sporadic clashes between worker's militia and army were reported, but they soon subsided. It was Ovando who publicly announced formation of the junta but by the evening of the 4th the more popular and constitutionally acceptable vice-president Barrientos emerged as the leader. After the Coup As Estenssoro with his US supported economic policies had alienated radical miners, and with his third term other MNR politicians, former MNR leaders Lechin and Guevara supported the coup, with Guevara becoming the Foreign Minister in 1967. One week after the coup Barrientos demanded that miner and worker militias surrender the weapons that they had had since the Revolution of April 9, 1952. Prolonged conflicts with miners followed. In order to reduces the losses of state-owned mines, miner's salaries were reduced by 50%. César Lora, leader of the miners from Siglo XX mine, was killed on July 29, 1965. By the end on 1965 a united leftist opposition People’s Democratic Council was formed. =Co-presidency= Barrientos lacked sufficient authority to have himself quickly elected President, so on May 7, 1965 he announced indefinite postponement of September elections and concentrated on eliminating his leftist opponents. He sent troops to take over state owned mines of COMIBOL and deported his former supporter Juan Lechin. The armed clashes with miners created an open split between Barrientos and Ovando, who withdrew troops from some of the occupied mines. On May 26, 1965 Ovando was installed as co-President and commander in chief of armed forces along with Barrientos in an effort to prevent split in the ruling junta and armed forces between leftist and rightist elements. During 1966 Barrientos received covert financial aid from the USA, which was caused by the fact that public office holders had to resign from their office 180 days before the elections. Barrientos followed this rule and this left him without means to pursue an election campaign. During this time Ovando was the President of Bolivia. Elections were held in July 1966, and Barrientos, as the Presidential candidate of the Front of the Bolivian Revolution won with 67% of vote and was officially inaugurated on August 6, 1966. United States involvement The officially released data shows, that covert USA expenditures in Bolivia between fiscal year 1963 and fiscal year 1965 were as follows: fiscal year 1963— $337,063; fiscal year 1964—$545,342; and fiscal year 1965—$287,978. Most of it went to support the center and right wings of the ruling MNR party. Already after the coup, CIA allegedly contributed 600,000 USD to Barrientos election campaign in 1966 and Gulf Oil Corp. donated additional 460,000 USD between 1966-69.

She is known for the books and booklets that she wrote about Colorado's history and its pioneers. In 1990, she was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame. Early life Bancroft was born in Denver, Colorado on September 11, 1900 to an established, \\"upper crust\\" family and was a third-generation Coloradan. Her parents were Ethel Force Norton, a socialite from Troy, New York, and George Jarvis Bancroft, a Coloradan who graduated in 1895 from Stanford University. He was in the school's first graduating class with future president Herbert Hoover. Dr. Frederick J. Bancroft, her grandfather, was a Colorado pioneer and surgeon. In 1879 he was co-founder and first president of the Colorado Historical Society, originally called the State Historical and National History Society of Colorado. He served as president for 17 years. The 13,000 foot Mount Bancroft is named for him, below which is Lake Caroline, which is named for her. George's wealth ebbed and flowed as he explored mining enterprises in Mexico and the western United States. Ethel rented out the second floor of their home at 1081 Downing Street to help support her two daughters, Caroline and Peggy, who was born in 1905. For entertainment, Caroline liked to ride horses that the family kept at a Corona Street livery or at the family's 2,500 acre summer home in Bear Creek Canyon. The ranch and summer home, purchased by Frederick Bancroft, were located between Kittredge and Evergreen. In 1923, the buildings were donated to the Evergreen Conference Historic District. She also like to travel to her father's Clover Knoll Farm by Barnum trolley. Education Bancroft received her Bachelor of Arts from Smith College and attended the University of Denver where she attained a master's degree in history. Central City, Colorado was the subject of her master's thesis. Adulthood and career Caroline Bancroft House, 1079-1081 Downing Street, Denver, Colorado is on the National Register of Historic Places. Standing six feet tall, she often wore paper flowers in braids that wound on the top of her head. She was friendly and witty to many. She called herself a social historian because she enjoyed being around her friends. Bancroft was known to say, \\"I'm Caroline. It rhymes with sin, gin, and jasmine. Take your pick.\\" Some found her without humor, sour, and forthright, which meant that she also made enemies. Bancroft worked as a cruise ship teacher and performed in the Ziegfeld Follies. She worked as a journalist for The Denver Post. She published nine booklets on Colorado History that sold nearly a million copies. They captured the \\"drama and spirit\\" of Colorado's history, but she may have occasionally taken poetic license in her storytelling. David H. Halaas, a historian for the Colorado Historical Society said \\"Caroline was—and is—a force in Colorado history.\\" Bancroft was particularly interested in the history of the Tabor family, Leadville, and Central City, Colorado. Daniel K. Peterson was the photographer and map illustrator for her on the booklet on ghost towns. Later years Bancroft suffered three times with tuberculosis, four times from cancer, and was blind for one year–and yet continued to travel. Bancroft died in Denver on October 5, 1985. Estate and award endowments In her will, Bancroft left her estate to the Colorado Historical Society and the Western History Department of the Denver Public Library, which awards an annual literary prize in her name \\"to the author of the best book on Colorado or Western American History\\". The Denver Public Library's Western History and Genealogy Department makes the annual monetary award, which in 2016 will be a $1,000, and non-monetary honor book awards. Her estate also funds the Caroline Bancroft History Project Award, which is made annually by the Colorado Historical Society, now called History Colorado. It is awarded to \\"an individual, organization or museum that has contributed to public awareness, interest or involvement in Colorado history, or to its advancement.\\" For example, in 2013 it was awarded to the Chimney Rock Interpretive Association (CRIA) that operates the Chimney Rock National Monument's interpretive program.

A post office called Phenix was established in 1886, and remained in operation until 1942. Limestone saw inside main building Limestone saw inside quarry In 1888, this discovery prompted Kansas City investor, C.R. Hunt, to establish a small limestone mining operation. For nearly two decades, Hunt ran the quarry as the Phenix Stone and Lime Company. By 1905, W.J. Grant, a marble finisher from Milwaukee recognized the high quality of Phenix limestone and purchased an interest into Hunts company. This operation grew over the years, that in 1913, it was named the Phenix Marble Co., which was known for producing Phenix Napoleon Gray Marble which was noted for its resemblance to a kind of French marble from the reign of Napoleon. With this high quality limestone, the industrial development of the small community grew to establish a company owned town, which was typical of the times. In 1902, a general store was established and in 1905 a two-room school house was built. The town hall, city park, and all the homes were owned by the company. A former quarry employee recalled that, \\"The company would give us script instead of money with which we could purchase supplies at the company store.\\" In 1904, the Missouri Bureau of Geology named Phenix as the largest and best equipped quarry in the state with a community of 500 employees. During the first three decades of the 20th century, Phenix Marble Company was one of the largest producers of cut limestone and marble west of the Mississippi, producing more than 250,000 cubic feet of stone annually. Production halted during the Great Depression, leading the railroad track used for transportation to be abandoned. During World War II, much of the quarry's iron equipment was scrapped for the war effort. The Phenix quarry reopened under the management of the Vermont Marble Co. yet failed to regain its previous position in the market.

A middle way The ideas of the Philosophic Whigs formed themselves in opposition to two competing trends - those of the Utilitarians and the Radicals on the one hand, and those of the Tories on the other. Philosophic Whigs such as Sir James Mackintosh or Thomas Babington Macaulay attacked the former for an abstract approach to society and a neglect of historical roots; the latter for looking back to an idealised past and neglecting historical change and developmental time.B. Hilton, A Mad, Bad, & Dangerous People?

Isabella, Risorgimento in Exile (2009) p. 115 Thus, during the debate over the Great Reform Act, Macaulay made good use of the concept of historical change to support the case for parliamentary reform: \\"Another great intellectual revolution has taken place....There is a change in society. There must be a corresponding change in the government\\".Quoted in J. Burrow, A History of Histories (Penguin 2009) p. 368 Their thinking passed in to the Victorian mainstream, through figures like Bagehot and Dicey who saw the need for laws to adapt to changing social structures and habits.B.

A freemason, she was initiated in 1982 at the Grande Loge féminine de France. She left this grand lodge to join the Grand Orient de France in 2013.  Masonic historiography  Besides Freemasonry, her research are devoted to the Lumières and the historiography of the Lumières as well as to the history of the English-speaking Caribbean, from the time of plantation companies to the abolition of slavery. Her research on the eighteenth incited her to examine Freemasonry, born in the age of Enlightenment. Cécile Révauger focused therefore on a largely unexplored area by the university community. She at first met a certain distrust from Anglo-Saxon Grand Lodges that demonstrated reserves regarding the public character of her work. Révauger gained a Fulbright scholarship from the Franco-American Commission, which enabled her to conduct research in the libraries of large American lodges in Boston, Washington DC and Cedar Rapids. She thus had access to the most extensive collections of Masonic archives of the United States and, thanks to the quality and quantity of information considered, she wrote a State thesis entitled: La franc-maçonnerie en Grande–Bretagne et aux États-Unis au XVIIIe : 1717-1813 (\\"Freemasonry in Britain and the United States in the eighteenth. 1717-1813\\"), supported at the University of Bordeaux III in 1987. By gaining a second search scholarship, she worked on the archives of Prince Hall lodges in New York and Washington DC and wrote a book on Black Freemasonry in the United States published in 2012: Prince Hall au XVIIIe aux États-Unis - Noirs et Franc-Maçons. Révauger writes in collaboration numerous articles on Masonic subjects and several anthologies.

It was redesignated as a Volksgrenadier division in 1944. It saw active service on the Eastern Front when the Soviets launched Operation Bagration, during which it suffered significant losses. It later fought in France before being absorbed by the 559th Volksgrenadier Division on 10 March 1945. Operational history The 361st Infantry Division was formed in Denmark during the period from October to November 1943, and formally established on 26 November under the command of Generalleutnant Baron Siegmund von Schleinitz. The division nominally fell within the responsibility of Wehrkreis VI (military district VI). At its core were remnants of the 86th Infantry Division, which had been disbanded due to significant losses incurred during fighting on the Eastern Front. Three battalions of infantry also came from the 94th and 137th Infantry Divisions, as well as the 141st Reserve Division. The division was dispatched to the Eastern Front in March 1944 and the following month became involved in the fighting in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. In the summer of 1944, the Soviet forces launched Operation Bagration and, as part of XIII Army Corps, it incurred casualties during this time. It, along with the rest of XIII Army Corps, became encircled at Brody and was trapped. While some personnel were able to fight their way out, its commander, Generalleutnant Gerhard Lindemann, and most of his men became prisoners of war. What was left of the division retreated into Poland and it was transferred to Germany for a rest and refit. Now under the command of Oberst Alfred Philippi, it received reinforcements from, among others, the 569th Volksgrenadier Division. It was now designated as a Volksgrenadier division and returned to action in the Arnhem sector. It was shifted to eastern France and then in the Vosges Mountains where it took on troops from the 553rd Infantry Division (de). The division ceased to exist on 10 March 1945, when it was absorbed by the 559th Volksgrenadier Division (de). On 20 April 1945 troops of the 361th V.G.D. have been seen by Dutch resistance in the Alblasserwaard and Betuwe (some of troops in the towns Buren, Kerk-Avezaath, Zoelen, Asch, Zoelmond and Beusichem were of 361 V.G.D.), bicycles were seen with the two crossed horseheads a regimental h.q.flag and V.G.D.361 written on it same goes for some cars (exept for the missing Regt.hq flag). At 24 April 45 a sign was seen in Buren with \\"Philippi\\" further more some redcross-cars wereseen in Zoelen at the same date, on the cars the sign with the two crossed horseheads and \\"vers.regt.361\\". So it seems that the parts of the division was not totally absorbed by the 559th V.G.D. or the staff was waiting for a new task.

The effect varies depending on the plant species, the temperature, and the availability of water and nutrients. However, enhanced rates of photosynthesis in plants due to fertilization are only partially transferred to enhanced plant growth and any hypothesized CO2 fertilization response is unlikely to significantly reduce the human-made increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration over the next century. From a quarter to half of Earth's vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Studies led by Trevor Keenan from the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) show that, from 2002 to 2014, plants appear to have gone into overdrive, starting to pull more carbon dioxide out of the air than they have done before. The result was that the rate at which carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere did not increase during this time period, although previously, it had grown considerably in concert with growing greenhouse gas emissions. Keenan concluded “Unfortunately, this increase is nowhere near enough to stop climate change.” Theory predicts the tropics to have the largest uptake due to the fertilization effect, but this has not been observed. The amount of uptake from fertilization also depends on how forests respond to climate change, and if they are protected from deforestation. Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments The ORNL conducted FACE experiments where levels were increased above ambient levels in forest stands. These experiments showed: * Increased root production stimulated by increased , resulting in more soil carbon. * An initial increase of net primary productivity, which was not sustained. * Faster decline in nitrogen availability in increased forest plots. * Change in plant community structure, with minimal change in microbial community structure. * Enhanced cannot significantly increase the leaf carrying capacity or leaf area index of an area. FACE experiments have been criticized as not being representative of the entire globe. These experiments were not meant to be extrapolated globally. Similar experiments are being conducted in other regions such as in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil.  Decreases in minerals and impacts on human nutrition Empirical evidence shows that increasing levels of result in lower concentrations of many minerals in plants tissues. Doubling levels results in an 8% decline, on average, in the concentration of minerals. Declines in magnesium, calcium, potassium, iron, zinc and other minerals in crops can worsen the quality of human nutrition. Researchers report that the levels expected in the second half of this century will likely reduce the levels of zinc, iron, and protein in wheat, rice, peas, and soybeans. Some two billion people live in countries where citizens receive more than 60 percent of their zinc or iron from these types of crops. Deficiencies of these nutrients already cause an estimated loss of 63 million life-years annually. References  External links * 4.

At one point the town grew to a population of 200 and had a grocery store, two blacksmith shops, a dry goods store, two drug stores, a water powered mill, a furniture factory, and four doctors. In 1887, the Chicago Milwaukee St. Paul Railroad Company established the town of Laredo on the west side of Medicine Creek, bypassing Alpha on the east side of the creek. This railway division point, midway between Kansas City and Ottumwa, Iowa, dictated that jobs and prosperity would come to Laredo instead of Alpha. This caused Alpha citizens and businesses to relocate to Laredo. Ultimately, the Alpha Post Office was closed in 1904.

Bareis was an assistant professor at Ohio State University where she taught for 40 years until her eventual retirement in 1946.  Early life and education  Grace Marie Bareis was born on December 19, 1875 in Canal Winchester, Ohio to George Frederick Bareis and Amanda Jane. Biography on p.48-50 of the Supplementary Material at AMS Bareis attended public school in her hometown, and then went on to attend Heidelberg University in Ohio. She graduated as valedictorian of her class and received her A.B degree in 1897. Bareis then completed part of her graduate work at Bryn Mawr College during 1897–1899, and later at Columbia University in that same year She took a brief break from school to work as a teacher at Miss Roney's School in Philadelphia where she would continue to work for the next six years. Two years after leaving Columbia University, she returned to Bryn Mawr College to continue her work on a mathematics degree. In 1906, Bareis enrolled in the graduate program at Ohio State University and after three years received the first Ph.D in mathematics from the university. Her dissertation, \\"Imprimitive Substitution Groups of Degree Sixteen\\", was directed by Harry W. Kuhn.  Career  During her graduate work at Ohio State University in 1908, Bareis became an assistant professor of mathematics. She held the position until her retirement in 1946. While serving as an assistant professor, she helped to direct master thesis of her students and also held various other positions in the Education and Women College. Bareis taught mathematics to World War II veterans in a class called the \\"Army Specialized Training Program\\" and even did so two years after her retirement because of a shortage of math instructors.  Personal life  Bareis was involved with various organizations. Her religious associations include the Evangelical and Reformed Church, Missionary Society, and Indianola Methodist Church. She was a founding member of the Mathematical Association of America, volunteered at the American Red Cross, and belonged to the Daughters of the American Revolution as well as the Ohio Historical Society. Bareis was a part of numerous groups at Ohio State University such as the OSU Faculty Club and OSU Alumnae Association. She was also a part of the Board of Trustees of Heidelberg College who awarded her an honorary doctorate in 1950. She enjoyed gardening and tending to her farm in Brice, Ohio.  Later life and legacy  In 1949, Bareis donated $2000 to Ohio State University to celebrate its 75th anniversary and to provide funding for a written competition between sophomores. \\"The Grace M. Bareis Mathematical Prize\\" (part of the Rasor- Bareis-Gordon) competition has been held annually in her honor ever since. Bareis had a home in Canal Winchester, Ohio, but she began living in Columbus with her friend and colleague, Margaret F. Jones, near the start of her retirement. She lived with her for 26 years until a prolonged illness caused her death on June 15, 1962. The Bareis Hall of Science in Heidelberg University was built in her honor.

It preys mostly on flies and mosquitoes. The name silver stretch spider refers to its shiny metallic colour and its habit of extending its legs into a stick like shape. Taxonomy and naming The silver stretch spider was described by the French naturalist Eugène Simon in 1874 in his work Les arachnides de France. Polish zoologist Władysław Kulczyński named T. solandri in 1903, subsequently classified as the same species. The generic name, Tetragnatha, is made up of Tetra meaning \\"four\\" and gnatha meaning \\"jaws\\" in Greek; referring to the unusually long chelicerae and fangs of these spiders and the specific name montana means \\"of the mountains\\". Description The female Tetragnatha montana is larger than the male with a body length of 7–13 mm compared to the male's 6–8 mm. The male has a paracymbium (a genital appendage arising from the base of the cymbium) with a mostly hook-shaped lateral process. In the female, the epigyne has straight or convex posterior margin of epigynal plate. The prosoma is yellow-brown and the sternum is dark brown to black. It has yellow-brown chelicerae, with a small round tubercle adjacent to the dorsal tooth of the male chelicerae. The legs are yellow-brown and the opisthosoma is silver on the dorsal surface with an elongated, silver- white leaf shape outlined in gold with golden wavy borders along the margins and black lines that can sometimes be quite thick with a brown ventral surface. The male has very similar markings on the abdomen to the female but it is a darker, reddish-gold and the colour contrasts are less noticeable than those on the female, and the white or silvery areas are much less extensive. The male's ventral side is brown, with undulating borders and a darker band running along it. The legs differ significantly between the sexes in their length, colour and shape, those of the female being brown, beige or yellow- brown in colour, while those of the male are darker. The leg pairs one, two and four are very long while three is relatively short and is used to help the spider to hold onto thin twigs or grass when resting, while the other three pairs are extended. In both sexes there are often dark rings and spots towards the claws. Behaviour The adults of T. montana appear in the open from May to September although the first to appear as early as February. Their main prey is flies and mosquitoes. These are caught in the spider's orb-web, which is an upright web formed of threads radiating from a central point, crossed by radial links that spiral in from the margin, between branches and stems on trees, bushes and low vegetation. The spider sits stretched out, near the web, waiting for the prey, difficult to detect due to the stick like shape adopted. If an insect flies into the web it is caught in the silk and the spider bites it injecting venom which liquifies the prey's internal organs. The spider then wraps the insect in silk like a parcel and stores it close to the web. The spider then repairs the web. When T. montana is at rest, or when it is alarmed it adopts the distinctive elongated posture used by species within the genus Tetragnatha, stretching their two pairs of front legs out beyond the head and the rear pair extending backwards. This together with their drab colouration and thin bodies, can be an effective camouflage. One study showed that mosquitoes formed over 60% of the food items of T. montana specimens collected from webs in an alder forest in Poland, it was calculated that an individual consumes an average of 3.7 mosquitoes in a day, in the first half of the month of June with the amount of mosquitoes caught and eaten declining as the summer progressed. A relationship was uncovered between the seasonal occurrence, abundance and activity of the spider and that of mosquitoes. This study showed that the main mosquito species caught were Aedes rusticus, Aedes cinereus and ' which were the most abundant mosquitoes in the study area, but they were disproportionately numerous among the mosquitos preyed upon. In Great Britain 13 out of 81 T. montana sampled showed evidence of having preyed on adult mosquitoes. =Reproduction= Mating in Tetragnatha montana is not initiated through courtship by the males, the male avoids being bitten by the female by locking her chelicerae in his own, using a spur and escapes after mating. The female then produces a dark green cocoon where she stores the fertilised eggs, this is encased in a fine white web. The cocoon is attached to vegetation, most commonly leaves, and the female guards and protects the cocoon against predators until the spiderlings hatch, after about 100 days. Molecular markers (allozymes) have been used to confirm that wild-collected females of T. montana, mated with multiple males, indicating that sperm competition is potentially an important driver in the evolution of the species' mating system. =Predators and parasites= Live T. montana parasitized by ' larva The main predators of T. montana are birds and insectivores, such as shrews and hedgehogs. The ichneumonid wasp Acrodactyla quadrisculpta has been recorded as a koinobiont parasitoid of T. montana. The wasp is host specific and 19% of T. montana in one population studied were parasitized, the parasitized spider builds a unique cocoon web which provides mechanical support for the wasp's pupal cocoon. The cocoon web consists of one reinforced main thread, often reinforced by a side thread, the wasp's cocoon is square and is fastened along the length of the main thread. T. montana has also been recorded as a host for Wolbachia bacteria which are reproductive parasites of many arthropods and nematodes. These parasites can influence the sex ratio of the host's progeny and in T. montana were apparently more common in females than males. Distribution and habitat T. montana is widespread throughout a large part of the Palearctic from Western Europe to East Asia and is the most frequently occurring species of Tetragnatha in many parts of Europe. as far north as southern Norway and south to Iran In Great Britain it is widespread in the south, becoming localised in the north. T. montana webs are found on trees, bushes and low vegetation in a variety of mostly lowland habitats. The webs may be found close to water but it is less closely associated with wetland habitats than its congener Tetragnatha extensa.

It opened to the public on 30 October 2015. A par 72 course, it is long. Critically acclaimed, it has been ranked third in the Australian Golf Digest Top 100 Courses rankings, and 24th in the world. History Andrew Purchase bought the land in 2011. Extra land was required, which resulted in Victorian course owner Duncan Andrews investing in the project, and the Tasmanian Government making some public land available for lease. Golf course designer Mike De Vries designed the course, nine holes of which straddle the coastline. The windy climate necessitated the use of multiple types of fescue grasses for the greens. The course has cost $8 million to buy and construct. Covering around 120 hectares (300 acres), the course encroached on the nesting burrows of short-tailed shearwaters. Some of these were destroyed in the course's creation, however, the construction took place outside the breeding season while the birds were absent. The site owners reported that the birds dug new burrows in natural areas the next season, and that the course has prevented access to locals taking birds for food. The course has been designed with wide fairways to accommodate for the strong westerly winds known as the Roaring Forties. Holes singled out for praise by ausgolf reviewer Gary Kennedy include the par five 9th hole, complete with ravine, the par three 11th hole alongside a rocky cove, and the picturesque 18th hole. Some concerns have been raised over the loss of access to public land, as the beach locale Victoria Cove was incorporated into the 18th hole and blocked from public use.

The concept of offshoring is not new; however, in the past, some companies have tried to open their own offshore offices. The OaaS model leans towards utilizing a team or company which specializes in offshoring work and uses them on a contractual basis as a part of their own team.  Benefits  Offshoring provides several benefits to medium and small scale businesses by reducing operational costs and providing capability to sustain downturns in economic cycles. It is crucial for companies to either invest in a robust management structure in offshore or find a trusted partner to effectively leverage offshore teams. Offshoring provides several benefits, for example: * Reduced operational costs providing capability to sustain downturns in economic cycles. * Access to a bigger talent pool. * 24 hours operational opportunity. * Increased productivity with extended working hours (onshore and offshore handoff). * Increased flexibility. * Economies of scale. * Diversity and access to a team that has a broader and longer view of the world. Challenges Offshoring can have its own challenges like communication and cultural issues, high turnover rate, lack of effective management, physical proximity, etc. It is crucial for companies to either invest in a robust management structure in offshore or find a trusted partner to effectively leverage offshore teams.

The roofs were altered in the early 17th century and in 1639 Sir Richard Heigham gave the present white marble font. A 17th century memorial to an Edmond Nevill also survived - he is said to have lived locally at Green Street House and he laid claim to the attainted title of Earl of Westmoreland. Other monuments to Giles Breame and William Heigham survive, whilst William Stukeley is said to have selected the church's churchyard in his lifetime - he is buried there without a monument. Though box pews and a triple decker pulpit were added (only to be replaced in the 1890s), the 18th century otherwise saw few alterations. A west gallery for children was added in 1820 and the south porch converted into a vestry ten years later, replaced by a yellow-brick west porch opening into the tower. In 1883 it opened the mission church that became St Michael and All Angels Church, Beckton Road. In 1896 the west gallery was removed and further restorations completed. In 1908 the south porch stopped being a vestry after a new level was created in the tower for a vestry. A complete restoration in 1931 removed the apse and chancel ceilings, opened out the rood-loft stair and stripped the external plaster from the tower. The London Blitz destroyed the chancel roof and the whole church's stained glass in 1941, along with other damage, but repairs were immediate and a permanent restoration of the nave was complete by the war's end, followed by a more comprehensive restorations in 1950 and 1965-1966. It now forms part of the East Ham Team Parish (also known as the Parish of the Holy Trinity) alongside St Edmund's, St Bartholomew's and St Alban's.

Early life and appearance  Midnight was foaled in 1916 on the Cottonwood ranch in the Porcupine Hills, west of Fort MacLeaod, in Alberta, Canada. He was originally owned by Jim McNab. He was a black horse standing and weighing 1,300 pounds. He was a crossbred horse, He was Thoroughbred on his dam's side and Percheron /Morgan cross on his sire's side. Midnight was branded with McNab's Door Key brand. When he was a three year old, McNab broke him to be a saddle horse by using him for a cow horse. He used him this way for two years. Midnight's spirit was so erratic that he was ready to buck even after a one- or two-day ride. According to an article by a writer in the Oklahoman, Midnight is a legend. \\"As often happens with legends, both human and equine, recounting the early days of such standouts can be difficult and confusing. As a rodeo historian, I have heard it both ways: Midnight was never gentled, always bucked from the very start; or Midnight was broken to the saddle and served on the McNabb Ranch as a using horse.\\"  Career - 1920s  McNab had tired of dealing with Midnight by 1920. He decided to try his luck using the horse for bucking at some nearby rodeos. In 1924, he entered Midnight in the Calgary Stampede rodeo. Midnight was proclaimed the \\"champion bucking horse of Western Canada.\\" During the 1920s, Midnight developed the reputation of being unrideable. Those attempting to ride him were usually thrown off in only 2 to 3 seconds. At that time, the target was to ride the horse for ten seconds. Then, in 1926, according to the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame, a cowboy who would some day be in the ProRodeo Hall of Fame rode Midnight in Montreal, Quebec. An article in the Calgary Herald also claims Pete Knight rode the horse. It was in the late 1920s that McNab sold Midnight to stock contractors Peter Welch and Strawberry Red Wall. The two were producers for Canadian rodeos. The pair then also acquired a smaller black horse called Tumbling Mustard. Tumbling Mustard's previous owner was a Sarcee Indian reservation. Not too long after that, the pair sold both horses to Colonel Jim Skew. Supposedly, he paid $250 for the horse but he was just \\"too much horse\\" for his show's riders. So, Skew turned around and sold both to producers Eddie McCarty and Vern Elliot. They hailed from Wyoming and Colorado. Verne and McCarty were a team who operated together. Verne was a notable rodeo producer and stock contractor who was inducted into ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1990. He was the last owner of the two horses.  1930s career  Some say it is only rumors that he was ridden by a cowboy named Pete Knight during Cheyenne Frontier Days at some point in the early 1930s. Regardless, according to many sources, no one is on record as having officially ridden Midnight, despite his long career and multiple appearances in large rodeos. However, the Texas Trail of Fame claims he was ridden by nine riders. He bucked at the inaugural National Western Stock Show and Rodeo in Denver, Colorado, in 1931. This continued until 1933 when he retired from bucking at the end of Cheyenne Frontier Days due to ringbone disorder. However, owner and horse made one trip to England. Midnight took four exhibition rides there, in Wembley Stadium. They soon returned home where Elliot retired Midnight to the pasture of his ranch.  Death  About three years after retirement, Midnight died on November 5, 1936, at the Denver Rodeo. He was buried on the McCarty- Elliott Ranch in Johnstown, Colorado, originally. He was estimated to be around 20 years old. He was buried beneath a gravestone saying: \\"Underneath this sod lies a great bucking horse. There never lived a cowboy he couldn't toss. His name was Midnight, his coat as black as coal. If there is a hoss- heaven, God please, rest his soul.\\" Tumbling Mustard was renamed to Five Minutes to Midnight. He also died on the ranch and was buried there. Later, both horses were moved and buried on the grounds of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Both horses were posthumously inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979. On July 9, 1967, in recognition of Midnight, Jim McNab officially opened the Midnight Stadium in Fort MacLeod, Alberta.

It was created in 1913 and belongs to this cicle of paintings, done until 1915. The cycle often depicts \\"\\" (prostitutes) with their clients. The overall cycle is dubbed to be one of the most important works of German Expressionism.  Description  In the painting foreground, two Johns are depicted. One is facing the viewer, one is facing the prostitutes. The model for the Johns probably was the artist's friend, Otto Mueller, but it could be possible too that Kirchner depicted himself as the model. The models for the two prostitutes are the sisters Erna and Gerad Schilling. The women are seen wearing very colourful clothing with elaborate lace collars and high-fashion hats. In the background one can see a busy street. On the street are a hackney carriage and the sign of the tram line 15, which at that time drove over the central stations of Berlin like and the Brandenburg Gate. They are looking at the two men provocatively. The Johns reaction to this is giving them their attention or looking away. The style of capturing just a moment in the street life is emphasized through the cut off men.  Style  In the painting influences of Italian Futurism can be found through the hasty dynamic of the work. The angular language of form is borrowed from Cubism.  Interpretation  Kirchner often depicted prostitutes and their relationship to their Johns. This was not meant as social criticism but rather an attempt to depict his idea of a new independent type of woman. Kirchner noted:  Causa Kirchner  In 2006 Anita Halpins, the granddaughter of the Jewish art collector Alfred Hess, demanded the restitution of the painting, which had previously been exhibited in the Brücke Museum in Berlin. The city granted the restitution. After that the painting was sold by the auction house Christie's for 30 million Euros to the art collectors Ronald Lauder and Serge Sabarsky. Then it became part of inventory of the Neue Galerie in New York. The restitution was based on the Washington Declaration from 1998 in which Germany said it would return the paintings that were confiscated during the Nazi era to the heirs of the victims.Pressemitteilung der Senatsverwaltung für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kultur, vom 17. The public reaction to the restitution was very negative. It was questioned whether the widow of Alfred Hess had been forced to sell the painting. Her family had gotten into financial troubles in 1929 after the world economic crisis and she could therefore have sold the painting for financial reasons. However the circumstances of the selling of the painting are unclear. The painting was transferred to the Cologne art association in 1936 and there sold to the art collector Carl Hagemann under unclear circumstances. Many people still questions whether the Washington Declaration was applicable in this case. It was doubted that the sale was connected to the persecution of Jews. Further more the Washington Declaration wasn't legally binding, therefore it wasn't necessary to restore the painting for legal reasons. Several complaints were filed against politicians from Berlin that had been involved in the restitution. The attorney's office however refused to file charges, which is why there were no convictions.Spiegel online 30. The sponsoring circle of the Brücke Museum still demands restitution of the painting back to them.

The 60-hectare complex, which stretches from Pikit, Cotabato to Pagalungan, Maguindanao, was a stronghold of the Muslim separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Accused by the Philippine government of harboring members of Pentagon, a notorious kidnap-for-ransom gang operating in Mindanao, the MILF was attacked in the Buliok complex by the Armed Forces of the Philippines under orders from then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Background After losing their camps, foremost of which was Camp Abubakar, due to the \\"all-out- war\\" policy of then-President Joseph Estrada in 2000, the MILF withdrew into the areas around the Liguasan Marsh. The Buliok Complex (called the Buliok Islamic Center or the Buliok Mosque by the MILF) encompasses areas where the boundaries of Maguindanao, Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat meet. It was within this complex that the MILF re-established their presence. The battle The Philippine government commenced military operations against the MILF on the day Eid al-Adha was being celebrated, tactically reasoning that the MILF forces would be vulnerable to attack. The government at first would not state the reason for the attack on the complex; later it would admit that the main objective was the MILF itself, in order for the government to maintain the dominant position in the conflict. Jesus Dureza, chairman of the government panel during peace talks with the MILF during this time, is on record stating that the attack on the Buliok complex came after the government failed to forge a ceasefire agreement with the MILF. Aftermath The Buliok complex was captured by government forces on 13 February 2003. A month after, the MILF attempted to retake their lost stronghold in an offensive that resulted in the deaths of 68-200 of their members. During this period, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the MILF exchanged widely-conflicting casualty reports.

Ali was 39 years old at this time, and Berbick was 27 years old. The fight went the distance with Berbick winning through a unanimous decision on points. This was Ali's last boxing match. Background Prior to the fight, Ali claimed that he had been declared fit by \\"even the best white doctors.\\" Nevertheless, the venue for the fight—Nassau in the Bahamas—was chosen because no American state would grant Ali a boxing license after his performance in the match with Larry Holmes. The promoter of this fight was James Cornelius, a convicted felon with links to the Nation of Islam. However, a problem arose since Don King had signed up Berbick for a three-fight deal. When King arrived in Nassau to demand his share of the profits from this fight, he was greeted by two friends of Cornelius who administered a sound beating to King. Ali had hoped to use this fight to earn a title bid against Mike Weaver the World Boxing Association Champ. Ali said \\"The stage is set for me. I love this sort of situation\\". Farce Ali's weight just before and during the fight was 236 pounds. One reporter described him as Michelin Man. Ticket sales for the fight were so slow that the promoters ended up offering them at a heavy discount. Ultimately, fewer than 7,500 people witnessed this fight. There was no pay- per-view television; no American network had even made a bid. However, ONTV aired the fight, with it airing at least in Cincinnati, Ohio. The fight took place in the unfinished Queen Elizabeth Sports Centre. When people arrived to see the fight they found they could not get in because the key to the main gate had been misplaced. When the key was found, it was discovered that there were no boxing gloves at the venue. There was also no bell to signal the end of a round; ultimately a hastily procured cowbell had to be used for this purpose. Because of the paucity of paying spectators Berbick refused to fight unless he was paid upfront. The fight started more than two hours behind schedule. The fight In the early rounds Ali tried putting together some combinations, but these proved ineffectual and he was pushed back on the ropes. In the fifth round, Ali landed some solid jabs and then a right-left- right combination on Berbick, but by the sixth round Ali had tired and started getting hit. By the last round, Ali was completely exhausted.

Although the palaces of Korea followed the ancient Chinese principles, Korea has maintained an independent culture for 2000 years, thus resulting in various differences. Korean people still preserved the original element in their architecture that shows no similarities to China or Japan. The kingdoms in Korean history have been build capital cities and palaces started from 1 BC, but its forms were unknown. The palaces of Gojoseon (2333 BC-250 BC) can not be traced at all. The palaces of Three Kingdoms can be imagined, mainly from some historical records and sites. The palace of Goguryeo was the Anhak Palace. After the capital was moved to Pyeongyang, there was a need for a new palace. Thus, in 427 AD, the Anhak palace was built. Baekje maintained it's palaces in Sabi (modern day Buyeo) and Gongju. Silla had it's palace, known as the Banwolseong within Gyeongju. The earliest evidences that show the concrete Korean architecture can be explored from the architecture of Gaegyeong, the capital of Goryeo Dynasty. The palace of Goryeo was the Manwoldae. During the Joseon dynasty, there were five palaces built. The Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, and Gyeonghuigung.

Principles of ancient China According to the Rites of Zhou (\\"Zhouli\\") containing the ways and principles to build an ideal nation, a city has to be square and walled. Each of its 4 sides has 9 li long (1 lis is measured 0,4 km). Three roads stretched from north to south are crisscrossed with 3 roads stretched from the east to the west. Each side is guarded with a gate. The palace where king lived is placed in the center with the ancestors shrine on the left and the grain and earth altar on the right. Court and market is placed in front of and behind palace respectively. The ancestral shrine is a place where the king and his family honor their forefathers. In the altar of grain and earth, the sacrificial rites were conducted to ask for a bountiful harvest every year. The arrangement of ancestor shrine and sacrificial altar on each sides of the palace symbolized the patronage from ancestor and heaven to the king. Meanwhile, the court location symbolized the nation's interest must be preferred by the ministers. The market symbolized the people contributing in trading. According to Zhou Rite, city and palace are protected by interior wall (gungseong) and exterior wall (hwangseong). Many cities built following the Zhou principles were protected with 3 layers of mighty wall with the palace in the center. The outer wall surrounded the offices and citizen's homes. The famous cities followed this principles are Chang'an, capital of Tang Dynasty (6th C) and Beijing, capital of Ming Dynasty (14th C) in China. In Japan Heijokyo (Nara) was modeled from Chang’an in smaller scale.

It shows a scene from the story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting takes the form of a stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly. The unfinished painting was exhibited in Whitechapel in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun. Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited for the first time at the New Gallery in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey. As Watts did not include After the Deluge in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in the two decades following its initial exhibition. Background alt=elderly bearded man George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full- time to painting. In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. Subject alt=Sun rising over a stormy sea, with multiple human figures in the foreground After the Deluge depicts a scene from the story of Noah's Flood, in which Noah opens the window of the Ark to see that after forty days the rain has ended but the floodwaters have not yet subsided. Although his father's strict evangelical Christianity had instilled in Watts a strong dislike of organised religion, he had a deep knowledge of the Bible, and Noah and the Flood were both themes he regularly depicted throughout his career. Watts had a strong belief in the idea that modern society was prioritising wealth over social values, and that this attitude, which he described as \\"the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity\\", was leading to the decline of society. Hilary Underwood of the University of Surrey writes that Watts likely painted so many works on the theme of Noah as he saw modern parallels with the notion of the cleaning of a degenerate society while preserving those who still adhered to moral standards. Watts chose to depict the moment at which the sunlight became visible for the first time, after 40 days obscured by clouds. Composition Light and Colour by J. M. W. Turner, 1843alt=hazy circle containing multiple human figures Watts illustrated the scene with a highly stylised seascape. Above the sea is a bright sunburst, with the light of the sun illuminating the surrounding clouds and bright rays projecting beyond the edges of the canvas. Watts's composition echoes J. M. W. Turner's 1843 treatment of the same topic, Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis, in primarily depicting a circle of bright light. However, Turner's painting depicts recognisable human figures, and no work by Turner ever came as close to pure abstract art as Watts's composition. In this stage of his career Watts regularly painted images linking awe-inspiring natural events and the will of God. His focus on the sun reflects his longstanding interest in it as a divine symbol; The Sacrifice of Noah, painted 1865, showed Noah sacrificing to the sun in thanks for his family's salvation. This interest in the sun possibly came from Watts's acquaintance Max Müller, who had written extensively on solar theories of mythology (the belief that the religions of Europe, the Middle East and southern Asia were all ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European worship of the sun). Writing after Watts's death, his widow Mary Seton Watts wrote that: alt=naked man sitting on a rock, in front of some more naked people and lots of water Watts had previously depicted an orange sun above a flat sea in his 1878 work The Genius of Greek Poetry, but the theme and composition of After the Deluge was radically different. The Genius of Greek Poetry was intended to evoke pantheism, with figures representing the forces of nature in human form working and playing, while being watched by the large central figure of the Genius. After the Deluge was explicitly intended as a monotheistic image, evoking both the magnificence and the redemptive mercy of a single all-powerful God engaging in the act of creation. After the Deluge was exhibited in unfinished form in 1886 as The Sun at St Jude's Church, Whitechapel; Samuel Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor; he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents. Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years. After completion The Sun by alt=sunrise over sea The Rising Sun by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, 1904 The completed version of After the Deluge was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1891. On the occasion of its 1891 exhibition and at a later exhibition in 1897, also at the New Gallery, it was accompanied by an explanatory note (thought to have been written by Watts) explaining the image: Between 1902 and 1906 it was exhibited around the country, being shown in Cork, Edinburgh, Manchester and Dublin, as well as at Watts's own gallery at Little Holland House. In 1904 it was transferred to the newly-opened Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey, shortly before Watts's death later that year. Two years prior to this, Watts had returned to the theme of creation with The Sower of the Systems, which for the first time in one of his works directly depicted God, and which he described as representing \\"a great gesture into which everything that exists is woven\\". Although Watts painted landscapes throughout his life, he did not consider such paintings to be major works, and when between 1886 and 1902 he donated what he felt to be his 23 most significant non-portrait works to the nation for public display, no landscape paintings were included. As a consequence of its omission from these gifts to the nation, After the Deluge is not among his better-known works, although it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists. Walter Bayes wrote in 1907 that After the Deluge was \\"the sort of landscape that we connect with the name of Mr Watts, a landscape from which all that is coarse and material has been eliminated, and which offers a residuum that is a kind of sublimation of all the most poetic elements in nature\\". It has been cited as an influence on many works painted in the two decades following its completion, including paintings of the sun by Maurice Chabas, Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo and Edvard Munch. After the Deluge remains in the collection of the Watts Gallery.

Biography =Journalism career= Sy is the son of army general Baba Sy, who participated in the 1983 revolution that brought Thomas Sankara to power. After Sankara's death in 1987, the younger Sy moved to Paris and headed the Committee for Defense of the Revolution. He was a critic of President Blaise Compaoré. Sy was a journalist by profession and edited the newspaper \\"Bendre\\". In March 2013, he was re-elected chief of the Society of Editors of the Private Press. Sy played an important role in the popular demonstrations that deposed Compaoré in 2014. Michel Kafando was chosen as president in November 2014 after a panel of 23 officials preferred him to Joséphine Ouédraogo and Sy. He became President of the National Transitional Council of Burkina Faso on 27 November. He defeated his main challenger, Ibrahim Koné by a 71 to 14 voting margin. He put forth a number of proposals in this position, such as revoking the death penalty as his friend Norbert Zongo was put to death. Sy also sponsored a law on the right of access to information. However, his most controversial law amended the electoral code. =Role in coup and aftermath= He was acting president between 17 and 23 September 2015, during the September 2015 coup led by Gilbert Diendéré. President Michel Kafando and Prime Minister Isaac Zida were held hostage as a result. \\"The coup was not a surprise,\\" he said. \\"I have always said since the beginning of the transition if that unit was not dissolved, these forces would be deployed elsewhere and that we would have problems.\\" He soon published a statement saying that dialogue was under-way between the military leadership and the \\"elements of the RSP\\" responsible for the coup, and noted that the country was in danger. Sy was a critic of the coup from the start. Known for his firmness of manner, he condemned an agreement proposed in the Economic Community of West African States by both African mediators, Senegalese President Macky Sall and Benin's Yayi Boni, that would allow the former supporters of Blaise Compaoré to compete in elections and offer amnesty to the perpetrators of the coup. Since he was third most important official in the country, Sy declared himself interim president. He initiated a social media campaign to oust the coup's leaders. A large part of the army went along with his campaign, as they distrusted Dendiere and the Presidential Guard. Dendiéré ended up admitting the coup was a mistake. When elections were announced for November, Sy declined to participate and exited Burkinabe politics. He was awarded a journalism award for his role in ending the coup. On 15 March 2016, he delivered the keynote speech at a conference in Accra, Ghana, entitled \\"Promoting Professional Journalism for Good Governance in West Africa.\\" He has been characterized as \\"a Sankarist through and through.\\" References Category:1960 births Category:People from Hodh Ech Chargui Region Category:Heads of state of Burkina Faso Category:Living people Category:Burkinabé Muslims ","title":"Chérif Sy"},{"id":"51848004","title":"Kim Tae-hyun"},{"id":"51848012","text":"Bheki Winston Joshua Langa (born in Stanger 1952) at WebCite is a South African diplomat and administrator.

In Jersey a yellow line perpendicular to the road indicates traffic should wait behind the line until the major road is clear (give way to other traffic) and is often accompanied with a Give way sign or a Yellow yield triangle painted on the road. In Guernsey a yellow line perpendicular to the road means STOP and Give Way to traffic on the major road. Sometimes a yellow arrow is painted on the road to warn users of a yellow line ahead. The yellow line for stopping is not used in Alderney or Sark =Commonwealth= Countries formerly part of the British Empire are likely to retain a modified version of the British laws including the basic principles regarding road safety. In Malta for example, a single yellow line, means no waiting (i.e. no parking, but alighting of passengers is permitted). The sign is applicable all day. =Australia= In New South Wales, Australia- single yellow lines indicate a clear way, where parking is strictly prohibited during certain times of the day and/or special events. Single yellow lines are also used in areas with high snow fall to mark the far left side of the road. =Czech Republic, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Poland, Italy= In Czech Republic, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Poland and The Netherlands yellow lines are normally not common in the regular traffic. However, during roadworks, yellow lines overrule the usual white lines to guide the vehicles through the site. Germany: yellow lines on the road override white lines =Malaysia= In Malaysia, single yellow lines are used on most roads leading to cities or towns or busy areas to mark parking restriction for certain times. =Philippines= In the Philippines, solid single yellow lines in some cities indicate bus lanes or bicycle lanes, which are restricted lanes for use solely by those vehicles. It is forbidden for vehicles on either side to cross the line. In certain areas, solid lines may give way to segmented single yellow lines which indicate that private vehicles may cross or merge into the bus lane, though buses are still forbidden from merging the other way. Buses still retain right-of-way in such cases. =Norway= Segmented yellow line used on two lane roads when traffic is coming in opposite directions. Passing is allowed. =Others= In Canada, Japan, Lebanon a single yellow line is used to separate traffic coming from opposite directions, where passing is allowed but with extreme caution. In the United States a yellow line is also used to separate traffic coming from opposite directions, but a solid line indicates that passing is not allowed. A broken yellow line indicates that passing is allowed. Double yellow lines = Australia = Yellow lines in Australia Yellow road lines are used in the centre of the road in areas with large amounts of snow to contrast with the white colour of snow. These lines are white in areas where there is infrequent or no snow. = Canada = In Canada, a double yellow line in the centre of the road means that it is unsafe for traffic travelling in either direction to pass (overtake). This is usually found on rolling hills or through corners where visibility is limited. In the province of British Columbia, it is against the law to touch or cross solid double yellow line at any time, except to avoid obstructions on the highway,Motor Vehicle Act Section 155 BC Laws or when a vehicle is entering or exiting the highway, if the vehicle can safely do so without affecting the flow of other vehicles.Motor Vehicle Act Section 156 BC Laws = Finland = In Finland, a double yellow line in the center of the road means that it is unsafe for traffic travelling in either direction to pass (overtake). =Hong Kong= Hong Kong is one of the regions outside the UK using double yellow lines on the side of carriageways. It means no stopping at any time. =India= A double yellow line, in contrast with a double white line, indicates a no-passing restriction. Double white is just a no-passing suggestion. =Ireland= Double yellow lines on the side of the road have a similar meaning (no parking at any time) as in the United Kingdom. Single yellow line adjacent to a kerb means parking is restricted at certain times. A broken yellow line marks the edge of the carriageway. =Lebanon= In Lebanon, crossing a yellow line means you entered the area where traffic is coming from the opposite direction. A single solid yellow line means that passing is not advised but you may pass, with extreme caution. A single dashed yellow line means passing is allowed. A double solid yellow line means passing is not allowed under any circumstances. A double dashed line means passing is allowed only if there is no cars you can see coming from the opposite direction. =Malaysia= Malaysia was once part of the British Empire, and today still applies double yellow line to mark parking restriction for all times. This line can be found in major towns or cities like Kuala Lumpur. =Malta= A double yellow line means no stopping. This means that unloading of goods and alighting of passengers is not permitted. =Mauritius= Mauritius was once a British colony, and today still applies double yellow lines to mark restricted parking areas at all hours on the sides of carriageways. = Norway = A double yellow line means that passing is forbidden in both directions. =Philippines= In the Philippines, double yellow lines (usually on either side of white segmented lines) indicate it is strictly forbidden for vehicles on either side of the lanes to overtake or counter-flow. These markings are commonly seen on blind curves and in bridges. =Singapore= Singapore, a former crown colony of the UK, also uses double yellow lines to indicate no parking at the sides. =United Kingdom = Double yellow lines in the UK indicate that parking is prohibited. Double yellow lines along the edge of the carriageway indicate that waiting restrictions apply to the road (which includes the carriageway, footway and verge). A driver may stop for passengers to board or alight and to load or unload (unless there are also 'loading restrictions' - see below). The regulation applies to all vehicles. The restriction applies from the centre of the carriageway to the back of the footway. Loading and unloading is allowed on double yellow lines at any time, unless there are additional markings indicating that there are 'loading restrictions'. A single short yellow stripe at regular intervals across the kerb or edge of the carriageway indicates that loading and unloading is not permitted at the times shown on accompanying black and white sign plates. Two short yellow stripes at regular intervals across the kerb or edge of the carriageway indicate that loading and unloading is not permitted at any time (and the sign plates may be omitted). Loading/unloading time may be restricted, depending upon the local authority making the restriction. One must not cause an obstruction to traffic or pedestrians.londoncouncils website History Double yellow lines mean no waiting at any time, unless there are signs that specifically indicate seasonal restrictions. They were first introduced in the UK by section 51 of the Road Traffic Act 1960 (repealed in 1972 and replaced by later legislation). Countries that were once part of the British Empire are likely to retain a modified version of the British laws including the basic principles regarding road safety. = United States = A double yellow center line in the United States indicates that passing is prohibited A yellow line (solid or dashed) indicates that crossing the line will place a driver in a lane where opposing traffic is coming at the driver. A double yellow line is a painted marking separating two lanes of a road. It consists of two parallel, solid yellow lines, and its presence usually indicates a no-passing restriction or no passing zone, where crossing the line is prohibited. Obvious exceptions to this no-passing restriction include emergency maneuvers or temporary traffic flow changes due to road work. Often the double yellow line has sections where one of the lines becomes dashed (in which case it is no longer a \\"double yellow\\"), indicating to the drivers traveling on the side closest to the dashed line that they may pass when it is safe. Double-yellow lines may be used to separate lanes of traffic traveling in opposite directions where passing would be dangerous, or to restrict access to lanes traveling in the same direction, such as HOV and express lanes on a highway. Two municipalities in the state of Rhode Island, Bristol and Warwick, replace the double yellow line with red, white, and blue striping along certain routes. In some states, it is not against the law to overtake vehicles in the presence of solid yellow lines if it is safe to do so. For example, Vermont State Law also allows passing across the double yellow line when no traffic is on the opposing side, however, one must pass quickly and return to the proper side. Pennsylvania does permit passing on double yellow lines when not also posted with \\"Do Not Pass\\" signage. However, this is unusual as most states have a ban on crossing a double yellow line except when turning, when passing pedestrians or bicycles, or if an obstruction in the road makes it necessary. Overtaking another vehicle across a solid yellow line is usually considered a serious traffic violation in most states. Some parts of the US use a doubled set of double yellow lines (sometimes called \\"double-double yellow lines\\") to demarcate a painted median strip, which vehicles are not permitted to cross. This differs from a single set of double yellow lines, which may be crossed in certain circumstances..

Operation  1918 Antiquities Proclamation In December 1918, while Palestine was still under control of a British military administration, a Proclamation for the protection of antiquities was issued.Major-General Sir Arthur Wigram Money, Antiquities Proclamation, 1 December 1918. In July 1920, the military administration was replaced by a civil administration under High Commissioner Herbert Samuel. One of the first actions of the new government was to establish a Department of Antiquities and promulgate an Antiquities Ordinance that defined its functions and authority.Garstang, 1922. The Ordinance was designed to follow principles outlined in the abortive Treaty of Sèvres, which were later included as Article 21 in the Mandate for Palestine. The main features of the Ordinance were: * An \\"antiquity\\" was defined as any product of human activity before 1700 AD, though there was an exception for objects actively used for religious purposes. * Authority from the department was required for the disposal or export of an antiquity. * Permission from the department was required for excavations, and would only be given to \\"learned societies or institutions or to individuals of proved scientific competence guaranteed by such bodies\\". * Proceeds from artefact discovery would be shared by the discoverer and the department in a proportion determined by the department, after objects needed for the \\"scientific completeness of the Palestine Museum\\" were chosen. * The department had the power to expropriate or forcibly lease private property containing important artefacts if no satisfactory agreement with the owners could be reached.Antiquities Ordinance and amendments. The Ordinance was replaced in 1929 and amended in 1934 and 1946. As well as a Director, the department had an Archaeological Advisory Board that included representatives of the major archaeological bodies and the main ethnic communities in Palestine.Bentwich, 1924.Survey of Palestine, 1946, Vol. 2, p.1047 The department included subdivisions for inspectors, a records office and library, a conservation laboratory, a photographic studio, and the museum. The department was located in a building called \\"Way House\\", north of the Old City of Jerusalem. The British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, established in 1919, also occupied the building until 1930. The Palestine Archaeological Museum, which was managed by the department, was also in Way House until 1935, when it moved with the department to a new building in east Jerusalem donated by John D. Rockefeller. The museum reopened to the public in 1938 and is now popularly known as the Rockefeller Museum.

History  Founded in 1924 by Friedrich Rometsch, the company was one of many in Europe providing car bodies for customers buying their motor-car in \\"bare chassis form\\", complete with an engine, and then employing a coachbuilder to add a custom-built body. By the late 1930s it was becoming more usual to buy the complete vehicle. Friedrich Rometsch and his son Fritz Rometsch had earned their experience while working for the coachbuilder, Erdmann & Rossi. During the early years most Rometsch car bodies were designed for use as taxis, using mainly Opel chassis. There were also some bespoke bodies produced for private customers. During the Second World War the company switched to manufacturing mobile field kitchens for the army. Johannes Beeskow, a Rometsch designer who had worked for Erdmann & Rossi during the 1930s, built the first prototype of a four-door sedan in 1950; the donor vehicle being a Volkswagen Beetle in scrap condition. Rometsch took this concept into the production of a taxicab. The wheelbase had been stretched by about . Access to the backseats was improved by incorporating suicide doors. 1953 Rometsch Taxi at Wolfsburg AutoMuseum Volkswagen The Beeskow and the Lawrence were also based on the Volkswagen Beetle, with a Rometsch body. These were named after their designers. Both models were available as a coupé and as a convertible. These vehicles gained awards at the Geneva Automotive Show several times. About 17 examples were built per year. When sales declined, mainly due to the competition from the mass production of the Type 14 Karmann Ghia, which was 1,500 DEM cheaper and also built on the Beetle chassis, the general director of Volkswagen, Heinrich Nordhoff, stopped the supply to Rometsch. He also prohibited dealers from selling either chassis or vehicles to Rometsch. When Rometsch realised they were selling the Lawrence at a loss, he was forced to cut wages to piece rate. A further blow hit Rometsch in the summer of 1961 when the construction of the Berlin Wall separated the business from nearly half of its 90 employees overnight. The production of the sports car ended later that year. From 1962 the business was concentrated on car body repairs, specialising in taxis. However, it did carry out a small series of bespoke conversions using Range Rovers, producing at least three lengthened-wheelbase \\"hunting vehicles\\" during the mid-1980s for General Secretary Erich Honecker. During its final years Rometsch turned to producing ambulance bodies and customising bus bodies for tour companies, while still also rebuilding damaged vehicles. The company closed in 2000. At least 200 to 250 customised bodies were manufactured by Rometsch; automotive historian Werner Oswald wrote of a total approaching 500,Werner Oswald: Deutsche Autos 1945–1990. while the magazine Der Spiegel reported up to 585. Taxi entrepreneurs from Berlin made Rometsch manufacture 38 of the stretched Beetle taxis.  1951 Rometsch Beeskow  The Beeskow was twice the price of its platform and parts donor, the Volkswagen Beetle. The Beeskow became \\"the Beetle for the high society\\". The design of falling lines on head and tail of the pontoon body caused it to be nicknamed \\"the banana\\". A third seat was installed behind the driver seat, turned by 90 degrees, facing the nearside. The actor Viktor de Kowa bought the first Beeskow at the Geneva Automotive Show. As Friedrich Rometsch had not thought of a price, he took a look at the Porsche exhibition booth next-door where the Porsche 356 was offered for 10,000 DEM and Rometsch offered the car for 9,800 DEM, which was accepted. Today that price would equal EUR. Both Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn also bought Beeskows. In the late middle 1950s, the design engineer Johannes Beeskow moved to the Karmann company in Osnabrück as their department manager of technical research. Some of the design elements from the Beeskow were found later in other vehicles such as the so-called \\"wheelbrows\\" on the bumpers of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL and also the roof of the Audi TT. About 175 Beeskows were built, of which the majority were convertibles. The Coupés can be divided into three series, easily identifiable by the size of the rear windshield which grew considerably with each change.

The bill's passage through both Houses of Parliament was completed on 20 June 2018 and it became law by Royal Assent on 26 June. The Act is to enable \\"cutting off the source of EU law in the UK ... and remove the competence of EU institutions to legislate for the UK\\". Summary. The 2017–2019 Government of Theresa May regarded it as the most significant constitutional legislation to have been passed by Parliament since the European Communities Act itself in 1972. To provide legal continuity, it enables the transposition of directly- applicable already-existing EU law into UK law, and so \\"create a new category of domestic law for the United Kingdom: retained EU law\\". It will also give the government some restricted power to adapt and remove laws that are no longer relevant. It makes future ratification of the withdrawal agreement, as a treaty between the UK and EU, depend upon the prior enactment of another Act of Parliament to approve the final terms of withdrawal when Brexit negotiations are completed. It fixed 21 January 2019 (at the latest) as the day on which the government must decide on how to proceed if the negotiations had not reached agreement in principle, on both the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and EU, and for parliamentary debate on this Government decision. The Act is one of a number of current and projected pieces of legislation affecting international transactions and control of borders, including movement of goods.\\"Factbox - Britain's Brexit legislation: What is left to do ahead of EU exit?\\" Reuters, 17 April 2018. The Act came fully into force on Friday 31 January 2020 at 23:00 Greenwich Mean Time, although it was amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 which saved the effect of the European Communities Act 1972 (ECA 1972) during the implementation period and formally ratified and incorporated the Withdrawal Agreement into domestic law after the United Kingdom formally left the European Union. The Act =For repealing ECA 1972 and ratifying withdrawal agreement= The Act is made in connection with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019, the second anniversary of notice of withdrawal under Article 50 (2) of the Treaty on European Union. The Act provides for ratifying and implementing the agreement setting out the withdrawal arrangements. The mandatory period for negotiating the agreement is stated in the EU negotiating directives as ending \\"at the latest on 30 March 2019 at 00:00 (Brussels time)\\" —i.e. Central European Time— \\"unless the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously decides to extend this period in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union\\". Subsections (2) to (5) provide the option of amending the date by a Ministerial Regulation \\"if the day or time on or at which the Treaties are to cease to apply to the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union is different from that specified in the definition of “exit day” in subsection (1).\\" Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union states: The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period. The Act legislates for the following: *repeal of the European Communities Act 1972. *fixing \\"exit day\\", naming the hour for this as 11 p.m. on 29 March 2019 (subject to possible modification due to a withdrawal agreement or agreed extension of the negotiating period). (This would be amended for the reasons above four times with the first amendment to 11 p.m. on 12 April 2019, the second on 11 p.m. on 22 May 2019, the third to 11 p.m. on 31 October 2019 and the final amendment to 11 p.m. on 31 January 2020) *formal incorporation and adaptation (\\"copying\\") of up to 20,000 pieces of EU law onto the UK statute book by: :*conversion of directly- applicable EU law (EU regulations) into UK law. :*preservation of all laws that have been made in the UK to implement EU obligations. :*continuing to make available in UK law the rights in EU treaties, that are relied on directly in court by an individual. :*ending the supremacy of EU law in the United Kingdom. *creating powers to make commencement orders and other secondary legislation under statutory instrument procedures. *Parliamentary approval of the outcome of the government's negotiations with the EU under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union. =Parliamentary approval: section 13= The Act's section 13 contains a set of mandatory procedures for Parliament's approval to the various possible outcomes of the government's negotiations with the EU. One outcome is that there will be an agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union which sets out the arrangements for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU. In the Act the agreement is called the withdrawal agreement. The Act provides (section 13) that before the withdrawal agreement can be ratified, as a treaty between the United Kingdom and the European Union, an act of Parliament must have been passed which provides for its implementation. The Act allows (section 9) regulations to be made and in force on or before exit day for the purpose of implementing the withdrawal agreement, but only if by then an act of Parliament has been enacted \\"approving the final terms of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU\\". An analysis of the process set out in the Act published by the Institute for Government discusses the procedure for approving treaties that is set out in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (CRAG) which may apply to the withdrawal agreement and the framework agreement for future relations, depending on what they contain. The procedure could prevent ratification, but in exceptional cases a government may ratify a treaty without consulting Parliament. Alternatively (section 13 (10)), if by Monday 21 January 2019 – less than eleven weeks before the mandatory negotiating period ends on Friday 29 March – there is no agreement in principle in the negotiations on the substance of the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom, the government must publish a statement setting out how the government proposes to proceed, and must arrange for debate about that in Parliament within days. The approval provisions use certain words in special ways: *\\"a motion in neutral terms\\" is used three times in section 13 and is not defined in the Act, but a document dated 21 June 2018 setting out the government's understanding stated \\"Under the Standing Orders of the House of Commons it will be for the Speaker to determine whether a motion when it is introduced by the Government under the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill is or is not in fact cast in neutral terms and hence whether the motion is or is not amendable. The Government recognises that it is open for Ministers and members of the House of Commons to table motions on and debate matters of concern and that, as is the convention, parliamentary time will be provided for this.\\" *\\"a statement that political agreement has been reached\\" is used three times in section 13, and defined (section 13 (16)) as a Minister's written statement that, in the Minister's opinion, \\"an ageement in principle has been reached in negotiations under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union on the substance of (i) the arrangements for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU, and (ii) the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom after withdrawal\\". =Coming into force: section 25= The sections of the Act that came into force immediately when the Act passed into law on 26 June 2018, as listed in section 25 (1), include: *8 Dealing with deficiencies arising from withdrawal *9 Implementing the withdrawal agreement *10 Continuation of North-South co-operation in Ireland and the prevention of new border arrangements *11 Powers involving devolved authorities corresponding to sections 8 and 9 *16 Maintenance of environmental principles etc. *17 Family unity for those seeking asylum or other protection in Europe *18 Customs arrangement as part of the framework for the future relationship *20 Interpretation *21 Index of defined expressions *22 Regulations *23 Consequential and transitional provision, except subsection (5) *24 Extent. *25 Commencement and short title. Subsections (2) and (3) relate to the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Subsection (4) provides for bringing into force by government regulation the remaining provisions of the Act, including: *1 Repeal of the European Communities Act 1972 *2 Saving for EU-derived domestic legislation *3 Incorporation of direct EU legislation *4 Saving for rights etc. under section 2(1) of the ECA *5 Exceptions to savings and incorporation *6 Interpretation of retained EU law *7 Status of retained EU law *13 Parliamentary approval of the outcome of negotiations with the EU *14 Financial provision *15 Publication and rules of evidence *19 Future interaction with the law and agencies of the EU. No regulation for bringing any of those provisions into force was made before the end of June 2018. =Post-act events= The Democratic Unionist Party, support from which the government needed to have a majority in key Commons votes, said on 2 July 2018 it would not support any deal which did not give the UK full control over its borders. After a meeting to discuss the latest development of the negotiations, when the European Union's chief negotiator Michel Barnier repeatedly told the Prime Minister the EU would not agree to discuss trade until an agreement was found on the terms of withdrawal, the prime minister informed the House of Commons on 2 July 2018 that she warned EU leaders that she did not think Parliament will approve the withdrawal agreement in the autumn \\"unless we have clarity about our future relationship alongside it\\". This was followed by a decision at a Cabinet meeting at Chequers on 6 July that continuing preparations for potential outcomes included the 'no deal' possibility. David Davis, who as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union had introduced the Act as a bill in Parliament, and who had attended the Cabinet meeting at Chequers on 6 July, resigned on 8 July. saying in his resignation letter, \\"In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real.\\" The next day, the prime minister appointed Dominic Raab as Brexit Secretary. Later in the day, the resignation of the Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, who had also attended the Chequers Cabinet meeting, was made public. Within hours, the prime minister appointed Jeremy Hunt as Johnson's successor. The government's policy on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union that the Cabinet had discussed at Chequers was published as a White Paper on 12 July 2018 for debate in the House of Commons the following week. While the President of the United States was on a visit to the United Kingdom on 13 July 2018, a comment by him that the UK would probably not get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's plan went ahead was widely published in the media. The government confirmed in the House of Commons on 19 July 2018 that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, as stated in the Withdrawal Act and the White Paper. The first meeting of Dominic Raab, the newly appointed UK Secretary of State, with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was in Brussels later on the same day (19 July 2018). Raab offered to meet Barnier throughout August to \\"intensify\\" talks, while both the UK and EU were insisting that reaching agreement by the autumn on the UK withdrawal in March 2019 was still very much on the cards. =Exit day= Exit day is the date and time defined in UK legislation for the switch from EU law to UK law, the main changes being to repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and to bring retained EU law into effect. It does not affect when the UK leaves the EU, but the intention is that it is synchronised with that event. As of December 2019 exit day is 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m.The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (Exit Day) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 SI 2019 No. 1423, 30th October 2019. The Act has been amended (by secondary legislation passed under section 20 of the Act) to update the definition of \\"exit day\\" to align with extensions to Article 50. Exit day was first varied to either 12 April 2019 or, depending on circumstances, 22 May, and then to 31 October 2019. It was also amended by the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 (the \\"Benn Act\\") to make such amendments mandatory rather than discretionary. =Connected legislation: world and cross-border trade= Two bills that allow for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement, that were introduced in the House of Commons in November 2017, completed all stages there in July 2018 and passed from the Commons to the House of Lords: the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill on 16 July, and the Trade Bill on 17 July. The government stated that the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Act 2018, which became law on 19 July 2018, would apply to a permit scheme for international road haulage and was made in connection with the government's aim in the negotiations to develop the existing international access for commercial road haulage.\\"Haulage permits and trailer registration\\", Department for Transport, 16 May 2018. On 4 September 2018, the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill passed its second reading, committee stages and third reading in the House of Lords, and later became law after receiving Royal Assent on 13 September. =Impact on devolution= The government published in March 2018 a provisional analysis about the devolved administrations receiving new powers as the UK leaves the EU. In devolved administrations, the powers currently exercised by the EU in relation to common policy frameworks would return to the UK, allowing the rules to be set in the UK by Westminster representatives. Ministers of devolved administrations would be given the power to amend devolved legislation to correct law that would not operate appropriately following Brexit. However, the bill also prevents devolved administrations from making changes that are \\"inconsistent\\" with those made by the UK government. This significantly limits the power of the devolved governments by making it impossible for them to, for example, choose to retain a piece of EU law that has been modified by the UK government. The National Assembly for Wales in response passed the Law Derived from the European Union (Wales) Act 2018, which became law on 6 June 2018 and was repealed shortly after on 22 November 2018. The Scottish Parliament passed the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill 2018 on 21 March 2018, to prepare Scots law for Brexit, but was referred for scrutiny to the Supreme Court under section 33 of the Scotland Act 1998, to determine whether the parliament had legislative competence to pass such a bill; pending that judgement, Royal Assent was not sought. The hearing began on 24 July 2018. On 13December2018, the Supreme Court ruled section17 of the Bill to be without the legal competence of the Scottish Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998, partly because it attempted to amend the Scotland Act 1998 itself (prohibited by Schedule 4 of the Scotland Act), partly due to inherent conflict with section 28(7) of the Scotland Act, and partly due to conflict with the subsequently passed and enacted European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 while the Scottish Bill was under review, and that the bill as far as that section is concerned is, therefore, 'not law'. The governments of Scotland and of the United Kingdom differed sharply on the outcome. The (UK) Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, said the court had \\"provided much-needed legal clarity\\" that the bill \\"goes beyond the powers of the Scottish Parliament\\", but Scotland's Brexit Secretary Michael Russell argued that the UK government had \\"changed the rules of the game midway through the match\\" in an \\"act of constitutional vandalism\\".Scottish and UK governments clash over Brexit court ruling BBC Scotland, 13 December 2019 In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended and the province has been without devolved government since 9 January 2017. =EU case law= At present, case law emanating from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU, formerly and still commonly known as the ECJ) is binding on UK courts. The Act will have ECJ case law retained as part of the law, but it will no longer be binding on the courts and tribunals of the United Kingdom. The legislation permits courts to depart from ECJ caselaw after applying the same test as they would apply in deciding whether to depart from their own case law. =Human rights laws= The Act makes explicit in section 5 that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union will cease to be a part of UK law after Brexit. =Additional repeals= Repeal of other Acts include: *European Communities (Greek Accession) Act 1979 *European Communities (Spanish and Portuguese Accession) Act 1985 *European Union (Accessions) Act 1994 *European Union (Accessions) Act 2003 *European Union (Accessions) Act 2006 *European Union (Croatian Accession and Irish Protocol) Act 2013 *European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 *European Parliament (Representation) Act 2003 *European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 *European Union Act 2011 *European Union (Approval of Treaty Amendment Decision) Act 2012 *European Union (Approvals) Act 2013 *European Union (Approvals) Act 2014 *European Union (Approvals) Act 2015 *European Union (Approvals) Act 2017 *European Union (Finance) Act 2015 *Sections 82 and 88(5)(c) of the Serious Crime Act 2015 =Amendments= Amendments to other Acts include: *Finance Act 1973 *Interpretation Act 1978 *European Economic Area Act 1993 *Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 *Human Rights Act 1998 *Scotland Act 1998 *Northern Ireland Act 1998 *Government of Wales Act 2006 *Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 *Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 EU response After the Act became law on 26 June 2018, the European Council decided on 29 June to renew its call on member states and union institutions to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes. Legislative history In October 2016 the Prime Minister, Theresa May, promised a \\"Great Repeal Bill\\", which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in UK law all enactments previously in force under EU law. It would smooth the transition by ensuring that all laws remain in force until specifically repealed. =Henry VIII clauses= In March 2017, a report by Thomson Reuters identified 52,741 pieces of legislation that have been passed since 1990. Transferring European legislation into British law is the quickest way to ensure continuity. These may refer to EU institutions that the UK will no longer belong to, or use phrasing assuming that the UK is an EU member state, and hence they cannot simply be directly converted into law. Redrafting all of the tens of thousands of laws affected and voting on them through Parliament would be an impossibly time-consuming process, so the bill included provisions, informally known as Henry VIII clauses, which would allow ministers to make secondary legislation to amend or remove these laws (both primary and secondary legislation) to resolve \\"deficiencies\\" by making statutory instruments. In the bill, the powers were divided between two clauses. Clause 7 made provision for ministers to correct \\"deficiencies\\" in law (including references to EU institutions that the UK is no longer a member of, EU treaties that are no longer relevant, and redundancies), expiring two years after the UK leaves the EU. These proposed powers could not be used to make secondary legislation for * Imposing or increasing taxation. * Making retrospective provision. * Creating a criminal offence with a maximum sentence greater than imprisonment for two years. * Amending, repealing or revoking the Human Rights Act 1998 or any subordinate legislation made under it. * Amending or repealing the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (with some limited exceptions). Clause 9 of the bill offered ministers unusually broad powers to make changes to legislation. Although some safeguards were included to limit the situations in which law can be modified, for instance with the inclusion of sunset clauses, the provisions granting these powers were criticised for being too wide-ranging. =House of Commons First and Second Readings= On 13 July 2017, David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, introduced the bill in the House of Commons. As a government bill, this first reading was pro forma, with the first debate taking place on the second reading. The second reading and debate on the bill began on 7 September 2017. The debate and second reading resumed on 11 September. Shortly after midnight on 12 September, the second reading passed by a margin of 326 to 290, a majority of 36 votes, after an amendment proposed by the Labour Party was rejected by a margin of 318 to 296. A motion to put the Bill under eight days of Committee scrutiny passed by 318 to 301. =House of Commons Committee Stage= The Committee stage was originally scheduled to take place after MPs returned to Parliament following the conclusion, in October, of their respective party conferences. However, Andrea Leadsom, Leader of the House of Commons, announced on 26 October that the committee stage was to begin on 14 November. Committee stage began as scheduled on 14 November as a Committee of the Whole House, and completed on 20 December 2017. MPs tabled more than 470 amendments to the bill, and one of these provided Theresa May's government with its first defeat on government business, as MPs voted by 309 to 305 to give Parliament a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. The government had originally suggested that as the bill will be a major focus of the parliamentary debate on Brexit as a whole, it would provide an alternative to a vote on the deal agreed in the Brexit negotiations. However, on 13 November 2017 the government announced that it would introduce a separate Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill to deal separately with examining an agreement from the negotiations between the UK and EU, if any is reached, which would provide Parliament with a vote, but this did not prevent the amendment to the bill being passed. The repeal was planned to be enacted during the Brexit negotiations, but to come into force on 'exit day'. As originally tabled, the bill did not give a date for 'exit day', but said that \\"'exit day' means such day as a Minister of the Crown may by regulations appoint\\". If no time is specified, it was to be \\"the beginning of that day\\". However, the government tabled an amendment in Committee Stage so the bill then said \\"'exit day' means 29 March 2019 at 11.00 p.m\\". To avoid a second possible defeat, the government accepted a further amendment that \\"A Minister of the Crown may by regulations amend the definition of 'exit day'\\", allowing for flexibility in the event of a transitional deal, or extra time being needed in the negotiations. A total of 40 divisions took place during Committee Stage. Proposed amendments that were not passed include: *An amendment to exclude the section of the bill which states that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union will not be part of domestic law after exit day, was defeated by 311 votes to 301. On 5 December the Government had published an analysis setting out how each article of the charter will be reflected in UK law after Brexit. *An amendment to allow the UK to remain in the EU Customs Union was defeated by 320 votes to 114. *An amendment to hold a referendum on whether to: (1) accept the final exit deal agreed with the EU; or (2) remain in the EU, was defeated by 319 votes to 23. =House of Commons Report Stage and Third Reading= The Report Stage and Third Reading happened on 16 and 17 January 2018. The bill passed Third Reading by 324 votes to 295. =House of Lords First and Second Readings and Committee Stage= The bill had its First Reading in the Lords on 18 January 2018, and Second Reading on 30 and 31 January 2018, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House. This lasted for eleven days between 21 February and 28 March. =House of Lords Report Stage= As part of the Lords Report Stage, a number of amendments were passed, of which 170 were proposed by the Government, and 14 were defeats for the Government, including: * Amendment 1: A proposal requiring ministers to report on the Government's efforts to negotiate a continued customs union between the EU and the UK was passed by 348 to 225 – a majority of 123. * Amendment 11: A proposal that certain areas of retained EU Law cannot be amended or repealed after Exit by Ministers, but only through primary legislation (i.e. an Act of Parliament), was passed by 314 to 217 – a majority of 97. These areas of retained EU Law are: (a) employment entitlements, rights and protection; (b) equality entitlements, rights and protection; (c) health and safety entitlements, rights and protection; (d) consumer standards; and (e) environmental standards and protection. Even technical changes to the retained EU Law in these areas can only be made with approval of both Houses of Parliament, and following 'an enhanced scrutiny procedure'. * Amendment 15: One of the few pieces of EU Law the bill proposed to repeal, rather than transpose into UK Law, was the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, but an amendment to keep the Charter part of UK Law after Exit was passed by 316 to 245, majority 71. * Amendment 18: A proposal which allows individuals to retain the right to challenge the validity of EU law post- Brexit was passed by 285 to 235 – a majority of 50. * Amendment 19: A proposal which limits ministerial powers to alter EU law when it is incorporated into UK law post-Brexit was passed by 280 to 223 – a majority of 57. * Amendment 31: A proposal to amend a clause that originally gave ministers power to make 'appropriate' changes to legislation, to instead give them power to make 'necessary' changes, was passed by 349 votes to 221 – a majority of 128, 25 April 2018. * Amendment 49: A proposal that means parliament must approve the withdrawal agreement and transitional measures in an act of parliament, before the European parliament has debated and voted on this, and also gives the Commons the power to decide the next steps for the government if the deal is rejected (dubbed the 'meaningful vote') was passed by 335 to 244 – a majority of 91. * Amendment 51: A proposed change giving parliament a say on future negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU was passed by 270 to 233 – a majority of 37. * Amendment 59: A proposed change requiring the government to reunite unaccompanied child refugees with relatives in the UK was passed by 205 to 181 – a majority of 24. * Amendment 70: A proposal to create a parliamentary committee to sift certain regulations introduced under the legislation to recommend whether they require further scrutiny of Brexit statutory instruments was passed by 225 to 194 – a majority of 31. * Amendment 88: The Lords voted in favour of inserting a new clause regarding the continuation of north–south co-operation and the prevention of new border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, 309 votes to 242 – a majority of 67. * Amendment 93: A proposal to allow the Government to replicate any EU law in domestic law and to continue to participate in EU agencies (such as European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom)) after Brexit was passed by 298 to 227 – a majority of 71. * Amendment 95: A proposal to remove the exit day of 29 March 2019 from the face of the Bill was passed by 311 to 233 – a majority of 78. * Amendment 110A: A proposal to mandate the Government to negotiate continued membership of the European Economic Area was passed by 245 to 218 – a majority of 27. On 30 April, a proposal to advance a second EU Referendum (amendment 50) was rejected by the Lords 260 votes to 202 – a majority of 58.Citations:  =House of Lords Third Reading= During the Third Reading on 16 May 2018, the Government suffered its 15th defeat in the Lords which, including the Commons Committee defeat, meant 16 defeats overall. The bill then passed the Third Reading. =Consideration of amendments= The Commons debated the amendments proposed by the Lords on 12 and 13 June. A majority voted to reject 14 of the 15 Lords' amendments and accepted only one, which pertained to preservation of relations with the EU. The government also agreed to accept an amendment encouraging the negotiation of a customs arrangement with the EU and further compromised with amendments concerning the issues of Northern Ireland, scrutiny, the environment and unaccompanied child migrants. A government-backed amendment allowing legal challenges on the basis of EU law for the three-year period following Brexit also passed. It was also agreed that any withdrawal agreement with the EU would not be implemented without Parliament's approval and if there were no such approval, a minister would make a statement setting out how the government \\"proposes to proceed\\" within 28 days, as contained in section 13 of the Act as passed. On 18 June the House of Lords passed another \\"meaningful vote\\" amendment similar to the one rejected by the House of Commons which allows a parliamentary vote on Brexit in case no UK-EU Brexit deal was reached, this time reworded so it wouldn't involve only a \\"neutral motion\\".

At first a rural agricultural market town, it developed in the second half of the 19th century as a small industrial center, producing finished wood products. Its downtown occupies an area of one block on both sides of Main Street, and features a diversity of architectural styles. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The town of Bristol, Vermont, is located on the west side of Vermont's Green Mountains. It was settled in the 1780s, and was a basically agricultural community until the American Civil War. Its town center provided services to farmers in outlying areas, including a market for their goods and sawmills and gristmills for processing their lumber and grain. In 1862, a factory was established in the New Haven River just southwest of the town center, in which turned wood products were manufactured. Soon converted to manufacture coffins, the factory complex grew by the early 20th century to become one of the nation's leading suppliers of that product, along with a diversity of other wood products. These businesses declined after the First World War. with Downtown Bristol consists of one long block of Main Street (Vermont Route 116), which runs east-west north of the New Haven River. It runs east from a central four-way junction with North, South, and West Streets (the latter continuing VT 116), and includes Bristol's town hall, located at the southwest corner of the junction. East of this junction, both sides of Main Street are lined with more than a dozen late 19th and early 20th century commercial buildings. They are typically two or three stories in height, and built of brick. The north side of Main Street in this stretch is mainly taken up by the Union Block, a single building with seven storefronts. Behind the south side buildings is the 1924 Kilburn Mill, one of the town's last surviving factories of the historic period.

The dance borrows inspiration from various sources such as silent films, movies, film stars and starlets (a la Greta Garbo, Fred Astaire, etc.) Musicals, Hollywood, Dramas, Cartoons, the photography book the Four Fabulous Faces, and their own personal life. The dance is characterized by acting/behavior, sharp striking movements and posing, extreme usage of space, athleticism, intricate musicality, and complete dominance of the music. The origin of the name Punking, derives from the urban slang term 'Punk' which was a derogatory term for gay men.Urban Dictionary The term Punking was coined by legendary DJ from Ginos II and Punking originator, Michael Angelo Harris, who used the word Punk as a form of empowerment to name what him and the collective group of men that were developing and creating in notable underground gay clubs such as Paradise Ballroom, Ginos, Ginos II . Once the dance started to further develop, the originators used the word 'Whack' which means to strike with force or a sharp blow,Websters Dictionary borrowed from the onamonapias of the 1960s TV series Batman , to describe how they were executing their movement. The terms 'punk' 'pose' and 'whack' became their way of loosely explaining the dance to outsiders who were interested in the dance they were developing. Throughout the early development of the style, it is suspected to originate from posing, which was simply freezing in a pose to the music from the early 1970s . It was a group of men who took posing and began to develop the dance into what would be referred to as Punking and then Whacking. These men were Andrew Frank, Arthur Goff, Tinker Toy, Billy Starr Estrada, Lonny Carbajal . Manoel (Viktor Manoel), Tommy Mitchell, Faye Raye, Kenny \\"China Doll\\" , with Michael Angelo Harris serving as the innovative DJ for the art form and movement. Through their exposure of the style in various clubs and contests throughout LA many already famous street dancers and choreographers would be introduced to the underground style, Original Locker and star of the TV series What's Happening Fred Berry Mr. Penguin or Rerun, Director/Choreographer/Singer Toni Basil, Original Locker and Star of NBC's The Big Show, Breakin', Adolfo \\"Shabba Doo\\" Quinones. Locking Pioneer,featured dancer of The Big Show, and Breakin' Movies, Ana \\"Lollipop\\" Sanchez, jazz dancer Dallace Ziegler, Choreographer Bill Goodson, and many others, exposing the dance throughout numerous high-profile TV, stage and screen productions and appearances. As the dance grew popular among those outside of the collective and gay clubs, the dance began to be referred to exclusively as Whacking to avoid the negative connotation associated with the word Punk. Adolfo \\"Shabba Doo\\" Quinones, was one of the notable \\"straight\\" dancers who learned from the creators of the style and created his own style based out of blending it with locking, soul dance, salsa, and martial arts adopting the character of the debonair male lead and machismo behavior often portrayed in films. His style in particular became very popular among straight men, exposing the dance to an even wider audience. Many of the originators of Punking, went on the expose the dance through their work and TV appearances on programs such as the 1970s TV show Soul Train and The Big Show as well as with several artists such as Toni Basil, Grace Jones, Diana Ross David Bowie , to name a few. Today the original style of Punking has since faded from public view due to several of its originators dying and has now evolved into what is referred to mainly Whacking. As of today, the only known remaining originator of Punking, is dancer/choreographer Viktor Manoel. Characteristics This dance is very action orientated, constant momentum flowing throughout, highly charged energy, and is extremely emotionally driven with a wide range of emotions, both internal and external, subtle and overt, constantly flowing throughout the dance a la a silent film which differs from the fashion inspired dance Vogue from NYC. The style consists of three main elements loosely referred to punking, posing, and whacking. Punking is considered the essence and storytelling element of the dance. According to Michael Angelo, since society referred to them as \\"punks\\" , the dance that was being developed should be referred to as Punk-ing. Posing was simply a frozen behavior similar to a screenshot from a scene from a movie. Lastly Whacking which simply means to strike with force, was the sharp striking actions that were made with their arms and various parts of the body. Collectively, these elements make up the dance Punking. The dance also borrows inspiration from many of its originators own personal influences such as The Fabulous Four Faces, Silent film , Musicals, Gymnastics, Ice skating, Bugs Bunny cartoons, Bruce Lee , Mexican Folkloric Ballet and many other sources. Other key components: Travel and constant movement, fluid, smooth, footwork, a la an ice skater, Extreme usage of space and movement, jumps, leaps, turns, runs, very little to no floor, dissecting musicality. According To Viktor Manoel \\"The Word Punk is an Insult in Urban Dictionary ( it means Fag ) and because All of Us that Started the Style of Dance Were Punks ! The Description when they saw us was ! Oh ! Their just Punks and they are Punking! So there you Have it.\\" \\"........that was the First Initial Word Used.. Then in the Straight Clubs it Started to be called Whacking, Females have never really had a Problem with Gay Men, it's the Threat of a Male From another Male that uses Descriptions such as \\" PUNK\\" According to the book Writing Dance in The Age of Postmodernism, Basil cites that although the creators of Punking knew Locking, they were interested in creating their own style taking the embroidery of Locking and the freeze frame points and wrist rolls transforming them into a gesture that moved decoratively around the head and incorporated campy poses that reference movie stars and poses from Vogue magazine .Writing Dance in the Age of Postmodernism Soundtrack During the early development and evolution of the style. one of the important factors that gave the dance its aesthetic was its distinct music. Created by Michael Angelo Harris, Harris would often take music of the time ranging from soul, disco, acid jazz, and more and refashion them by speeding up the RPM of the instrumental breaks of the song to create the dance own soundtrack. This distinct way of DJing was a covert way, of ensuring that some of the famous choreographers at the time who came to the clubs to see what they were developing were not able to really see what the dancers were doing. This sped up music also gave the dance its distinct jump cut rhythm, but challenged the dancers to conquer or dominate the sound, instead of the sound dominating the dancer which gave the dance its distinctive edge. Harris was noted for using his platform to not only protect the collective group of men and what they were creating purely underground and primarily gay, but also becoming one of the most innovative DJs to emerge from Hollywood's community. After Gino's, and Gino's II, Harris would go on to host the midnight show at Peanuts which included many notable performers from Hollywood's gay scene including Viktor Manoel , who was known as the androgynous \\"Manoel\\" , who would lip-sync and perform at the midnight show. Peanuts become one of the hottest clubs in LA throughout the 80's especially among famous performers and singers. After the era of Gino's, Ginos II, and Peanuts, many of the notable architects of the artform passed away from various causes, during the height of the AIDS epidemic of the 80's and 90*s . It is noted that several of Michelangelo's records have been distributed and circulated among his friends in throughout San Francisco .

Settled c. 1790 and developed mainly in the mid-19th century, the village, stretched along Church Hill Road west of Hinesburg Road, retains a well-preserved 19th-century atmosphere of residential, civic, and commercial buildings. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The town of Charlotte was chartered in 1762, but not settled until c. 1784, after the American Revolutionary War. By tradition, a stake was placed at the town's geographic center, and that is where the village of Charlotte Center arose. It was located on the area's major north-south route (now bypassed by the modern alignment of United States Route 7) running east-west between two hills. It developed as a stop on the stagecoach route between Burlington and Troy, New York when Hezekiah Barnes, the village's first settler, built a tavern in 1800. The village was the principal civic and commercial area of the town until the construction of the Central Vermont Railroad bypassed it, after which commercial and political activity was largely removed to Charlotte Four Corners, where the railroad station was located. with The historic district extends westward in a linear fashion along Church Hill Road, the former stagecoach route and one-time alignment of US 7, from its junction with Hinesburg Road. Its dominant features are the 1854 Greek Revival Congregational Church, and the 1850 former Town Hall, now the local museum. Most of the buildings are of wood frame construction, and were built before 1860. The only stone house, a Cape style structure, was built by Hezekiah Barnes about 1790 near his tavern (which no longer stands, but whose site is marked). The dispersed district also includes several barns from the early 20th century, as well as one believed to have been built by Barnes about the same time as the stone house.

The founding of the CCP was part of a global initiative for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors. After successful completion of the pilot phase at the end of 2014, the CCP relocated its headquarters to Rome in January 2015. The CCP is part of the academic structure of the Pontifical Gregorian University as part of the Institute of Psychology. It closely collaborates with the Faculties of Theology, Canon Law, and Social Sciences. A main task of the institution is the creation of a global e-learning training centre for pastoral professions responding to the sexual abuse of minors, taking into account multilingual and intercultural issues. Purpose The CCP is dedicated to the safeguarding and well-being of minors throughout the world by promoting prevention measures against sexual and other kinds of abuse and by raising awareness and knowledge of the importance of such efforts in order to create a healthy environment. The CCP works from the position that safeguarding the dignity of every human person, especially the well-being of children and vulnerable persons, is the responsibility of everyone. Support for co-responsibility is also expressed by the Catholic magisterium. Pope John Paul II, in relation to preserving and promoting human life, says: 'It remains a sacred reality entrusted to us, to be preserved with a sense of responsibility and brought to perfection in love and in the gift of ourselves to God and to our brothers and sisters.'Pope John Paul II's encyclical Evangelium Vitae: As a global institution affected by sexual abuse, the Catholic Church has clearly recognized the significance of this matter. Pope Benedict XVI acknowledged it, saying that 'the power of evil penetrated so far into the interior world of the faith is a suffering that we must bear, but at the same time, we must do everything to prevent it from repeating.'CBC News, Former pope Benedict defends sex-abuse record: http://www.cbc.ca/m/touch/world/story/1.1866637 The CCP is among the decisive responses of the Catholic Church to acknowledge, respond to, and prevent abuse.http://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/9324/q-a-with-hans-zollner-sj Q and A with Hans Zollner Pope Francis follows in this line saying: 'This is a tragedy. We must not tolerate the abuse of minors. We must defend minors. And we must severely punish the abusers.' Francis rails against child sexual abuse, saying abusers must be 'severely' punished: https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/francis-rails-against-child-sexual- abuse-saying-abusers-must-be-severely-punished Recognizing that pastoral caregivers are often first contact persons for victims, the CCP is committed to the training and education of priests and candidates for the priesthood, religious orders, Church workers, teachers, and social workers, raising awareness and offering training for a competent response. Educating clergy, religious, and other pastoral caregivers is a first resource to improve the environment of Catholic parishes, schools, homes, etc. in order that the Church may be a place of shelter and help for sexually abused persons. History =Origins of a Response= It is clear from different reports that the violence against children is very substantial and a serious global problem. It occurs in every country in the world in a variety of forms and settings and is often deeply rooted in cultural, economic, and social practices.World Report on Violence Against Children, UNICEF: http://www.unicef.org/violencestudy/I.%20World%20Report%20on%20Violence%20against%20Children.pdfPrevalence of Sexual Violence Against Children and Use of Social Services — Seven Countries, 2007–2013, CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6421a1.htm?s_cid=mm6421a1_wChild Abuse Statistics & Facts, Child Help: https://www.childhelp.org/child-abuse- statistics/The State of World’s Children 2005- Childhood Under Treat, UNICEF: http://www.unicef.org/sowc05/english/sowc05.pdfIndependent, UN Report Uncovers Global Child Abuse : https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/un- report-uncovers-global-child-abuse-419700.html In recent decades, a large number of cases of clerical abuse of minors have been made known in the United States, Ireland, Australia, and other parts of the world. They have received significant media and public attention. The Church feels responsible for its members’ dehumanising acts, and Pope Benedict XVI initiated a serious process to deal with this problem. In the light of this crisis, there has been a renewed attempt on the part of the Church to look into the matter with due attention and to take corrective steps. Since his election, Pope Francis has taken a firm stand to offer new hope to victims, with a call for action concerning sexual abuse in the Church. The Catholic Church has established two institutions that support the Church in her actions against sexual abuse, namely the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors (2014) and the Centre for Child Protection in Rome (2015). The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors has the role of assisting and advising the Pope in matters of justice for abuse victims, survivors of sexual abuse, and matters regarding safeguarding. It strives to pull together the best practices and policies from different parts of the world and to provide guidelines. It also aims to achieve two major objectives, namely connecting people worldwide and raising consciousness amongst all of society. =Beginnings of the CCP= The idea for the foundation of the CCP came in 2011, when Fr Hans Zollner SJ (Dean of the Institute of Psychology of the Pontifical Gregorian University) and Prof. Jörg M. Fegert (Director of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the State University Clinic of Ulm) met during a working group meeting for the German Federal Government's Round Table on Child Sexual Abuse (initiated in response to the 2010 media storm spotlighting clerical sexual abuse in Germany). At the same time, the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising learned about the idea and pledged to support it. Even from the outset, the project was understood to be a long-term response of ongoing education in the safeguarding of minors. It was decided to have a three-year pilot phase (January 2012 - December 2014) based in Munich with a steering committee consisting of Fr Hans Zollner SJ, Prof. Jörg M. Fegert, and Msgr Klaus Peter Franzl for the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising. The Centre launched its work with a Symposium 'Towards Healing and Renewal' that was organized from 6 to 9 February 2012 at the Gregorian University in Rome. During the pilot phase, two major conferences were organized to raise awareness about the work of the CCP in safeguarding, to study the situation, and to present the state of the question in the Catholic Church. The first conference took place in Freising, from 30 October to 1 November 2012, entitled 'Communication and Empowerment: Victims of Child Sexual Abuse'. The second conference (7-8 November 2013) was held in Munich on the topic 'Learning from the Past: Implications for the Future'. The primary project of the CCP during this phase was the development of a multilingual online education programme on the prevention of child sexual abuse for pastoral professions in connection with eleven partners in ten countries.Böhm, B., Fegert, J. M., Zollner, H., Fuchs, K. A. & Witte, S. (2015). Internationales ELearning Curriculum „Prävention von sexuellem Kindesmissbrauch für pastoraleBerufe“. Forschungsergebnisse zu Zufriedenheit, Qualität und Passung. Nervenheilkunde, 34, 547-554 In 2014 it was decided to move the headquarters of the Centre to Rome. A closing event was held in Munich on 26 November 2014. =The CCP in Rome= In January 2015 the CCP moved to Rome, expanded its network, and took on new educational projects and research activities. On 16 February 2015 the CCP was officially launched in Rome. Cardinal Gehard Ludwig Müller and other representatives of the Holy See attended, and Cardinal Seán Patrick O'Malley read out a letter of thanks and encouragement from Pope Francis. Structure and Organization The CCP is part of the Institute of Psychology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Fr Prof. Dr Hans Zollner SJ is the CCP President. An international and interdisciplinary team staffs the office. A Scientific Advisory Board accompanies the development as well as the activities of the Centre. It consists of international ecclesiastical and non-ecclesiastical experts in research and practice. The present members are Prof. Sheila the Baroness Hollins (Chair), Msgr Dr Peter Beer, Prof. Dr Delphine Collin-Vezina, Prof. Dr Gabriel Dy-Liacco, and Msgr Dr Stephen Rossetti. Activities The first mission of the CCP is to safeguard the dignity of minors, educating to protect them from all kinds of abuses and any attempt to violate their integrity, both within the Catholic Church and in society. To this end, the Centre has undertaken numerous activities, giving emphasis to research as well as academic formation and training. It has developed an e-learning programme, adjusted to the respective cultural, linguistic, and legal situations of diverse international contexts. The Centre works in interdisciplinary research projects concerning safeguarding minors. It collaborates with an international academic network as well as with doctoral students in various fields (Psychology, Theology, Spirituality, Canon Law, Social Sciences, etc.). Initiatives include: =Training and Education= The two main projects of the CCP are: the development of an e-learning programme and the implementation of an intensive face-to-face course (Diploma Course). E-Learning: 'Safeguarding: Our Commitment, a Programme for the Prevention of Sexual Abuse of Minors' The CCP offers multilingual and multicultural e-learning training and qualification on different levels of expertise (academic and non-academic levels) for pastoral professions, Church leaders, social workers, teachers, and also for university students. This web- based, certified education and training programme is offered in five languages (English, Italian, German, French, and Spanish). It provides learning modules, which can be adapted worldwide to meet contextual needs. The Centre has partners in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Germany, Ghana, India, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, and Uruguay. Diploma Course The Diploma Course aims at training people involved in the field of safeguarding such as safeguarding officers, advisors, and collaborators in different places like dioceses, religious congregations, and educational institutions. It also provides training for those who will be future trainers in the field of safeguarding in seminaries, formation houses, schools, etc. The Centre completed the first session of its Diploma Course on 14 June 2016 with the participation of 19 students from 15 countries and 4 continents. At the commencement ceremony, the German government's independent commissioner on child sexual abuse, Johannes- Wilhelm Rörig, gave the keynote address. Licentiate (Master) Course The CCP offers an interdisciplinary Licentiate — or Master's — degree in Safeguarding, which is a two year program with two specialized tracks: Intervention and Prevention. =Research and Scientific Publications= The CCP has set up a research centre that is oriented towards two major fields of study, mapping the situation of child abuse in different parts of the world and human formation in seminary formation. The Centre has published many scientific works: *Toward Healing and Renewal: The 2012 Symposium on Sexual Abuse of Minors Held at the Pontifical Gregorian University.

It is the first in a duology. Plot Cassandra \\"Cas\\" Leung is at a dawn check up of her Reckoner Durga, one of many genetically engineered sea monsters bred and trained by Cas' family business. The Reckoners and their trainers act as paid protection for ships passing through the dangerous NeoPasific ocean. While checking up with Durga, Cas notes that it's making strange noises. She speaks to her mother, the lead biologist working on the Reckoner program, about this issue. Her mother suggests that her concerns are just nervousness for her first mission as Reckoner trainer. Cas begrudgingly relents. The next day Cas boards the Nereid, a luxury cruise ship she is tasked to protect with Durga. As the days move forwards Cas grows increasingly concerned with Durga's heath, as its strange noises grow to violent tremors and the water becomes thick with its blood. Despite this, the captain of the Nereid rejects the idea of turning around. This is revealed to be a mistake when Cas wakes to news that a pirate ship was spotted approaching The Nereid. Durga, being too weak to fight the pirates, is brutally killed in front of Cas. The Nereid is then boarded by pirates, the crew is murdered, and Cas is dragged aboard the pirate ship Minnow. After a failed suicide attempt, she is brought before the captain of the Minnow, the notorious pirate Santa Elana. Santa Elana presents Cas with a Baby Reckoner, still in an embryonic sac, that she is to train for use by the Minnow against other Reckoners. Cas then becomes the ward of Swift, one of Santa Elana's lieutenants. Swift is to make sure Cas successfully raises the Reckoner pup, and becomes situated within the Minnow's culture. An arrangement neither are pleased with. Cas next faces danger when she has to undergo the complicated process of birthing the Reckoner pup from its embryonic sac, knowing that if she fails she will likely die with it. The sac is carefully cut open with the Reckoner being safely released into a small pool. With the pup born Cas spends her time either on the training deck with the Reckoner baby she names Bao, or by Swifts side. Cas and Bao are often locked in the training deck together as Cas nurtures the infant Reckoner. Cas and Swift are made similarly inseparable by the consent threat of Cas being murdered or assaulted by a pirate in Swifts absence. Despite this danger, Cas is successful in bringing Bao into adolescence, with the Reckoner now able to swim in the open ocean. The danger has also done little to stop Cas from bonding with Swift and Santa Elana's other Lieutenants. Cas is even cheered on by her captors when she rides Bao alongside The Minnow. Swift Begins assisting Cas in training Bao, getting him to obey commands give via a LED beacon mounted on Cas' wrist. The two sharing a laugh at Cas saving Swift from almost being mauled by Bao whilst trying to feed. It is around this time Cas begines to have conflicting views of Swift, seeing her as both a captor and a guardian. A Relationship that is complicated when Cas witnesses Swift take part in a raid against a civilian ship, and is reminded again that both Swift and herself are culpable for acts of violence perpetrated by the Minnow. That see could have taken Bao and defended the ship from The Minnow. That Swift, and maybe Cas herself, were pirates. Cas and Swift's relationship stagnates over the next few weeks following the raid, with much of their time together being spent in silence while training Bao. This awkward period is broken when Swift takes Cas into the Slew, a joint gym and combat arena. Cas bests Swift in a fight and the crowd of pirates cheers her victory. A sign of Cas' acceptance in pirate society. Later, after Bao was nearly struck by The Minnow, Cas runs to check up on it. She arrives at the training deck to find one of Santa Elana's Lieutenants, Code, hovering above Bao with a Syringe of poison in his hands. Still hidden, Cas watches as Swift runs into the deck and tackles Code to the ground. Together they subdue Code and bring him to Santa Elana. They quickly realize that Code attempted to kill Bao so Santa Elana would kill Cas and then Swift, thus insuring his place as Santa Elana's Successor. Shaken from their encounter, Cas and Swift spend the night in each other's company. Code is later executed by being fed to Bao, much to Cas' horror. Swift confronts Cas after she runs from the site of the execution, calling her a hypocrite for being appalled by the murder of Code by a Reckoner but not by the thousands who died at the hands of Reckoner Justice. In the ensuing fight Swift admits to caring deeply for Cas, a notion Cas rejects due to the power imbalance innate to their relationship. The day after Cas and Swift's fight the Minnow Docks at The Flotilla, a floating city in the NeoPascific. Cas, being Swifts ward, is forced to accompany her into the city. Cas is surprised when Swift takes her to visit her families shack. After speaking with Swift's father, the two journey into the center of the Flotilla to shop. Eventually Swift leads them to a secluded rooftop where they speak about Swifts history as a pirate and being the breadwinner of her family. On their way back to the Minnow Cas is spotted by Fabian Murphey, an associate of her mother. Fabian tries to grab onto Cas, but she is pulled away by swift and the two escape the man by jumping off the Flotilla and into the ocean. Back on the ship, Santa Elana explains to her crew that Fabian will likely inform the mainland military that the Minnow has a Reckoner in its arsenal, and that they can expect an attack on their ship by the military in about three days. Cas also learns that it was fabian who supplied Santa Elana with a Reckoner pup, and is likely responsible for the death of Durga. Santa Elana gives Cas three days to make Bao combat ready and fight off the mainland attack. It takes her one day. The first attack from the mainland comes early in the form of a squadron of quad-copters, which are shot down by the Minnow or swatted out of the air by Bao. Cas spends the next few hours working through her killing the quad-copter pilots. Ultimately Cas determines the killing was necessary. Later the next night Cas visits Swift at her gun position. They have a conversation about how they feel trapped by their circumstance, that they wish they could escape poverty, and piracy. It is also on the deck at night Cas and Swift wordlessly acknowledge their mutual romantic feelings, but know they can't been in a relationship with such an imbalance of power. The next morning the whole crew of the Minnow rallies to fight the second and final mainland attack. As Cas is preparing for battle on the training deck, she says her final goodbyes to Swift, believing she will be forced to bring Bao back to the mainland after the battle. It is here the couple shares their first kiss. Cas then rides Bao into battle, killing three other Reckoners and destroying their ships, allowing for the Minnow to escape. Cas and Bao eventually catch up with the Minnow, and asks for an audience with Santa Elana. Cas admits she can no longer live on the mainland, that she has become, in her heart, a pirate and asks to be taken on as one of Santa Elana's Lieutenants. Cas argues that if she lets Bao go the mainland will no longer hunt them. That she will make a good pirate, doing what ever is asked of her; except kill another Reckoner. It is at this point that Santa Elana informs Cas that Swift was the one who poisoned Durga, so a Reckoner killer is unneeded. Made numb by betrayal, Cas frees Bao by drops her Training Beacon into the ocean, and officially joins the Minnow's crew. =Publication history= 2016, US, Flux , Pub date 8 February 2016, Trade Paperback  Themes  = Moral Relativism = The Abyss Surrounds Us posits that neither the mainland or pirate society are wholly moral or immoral. Instead it takes a stance of moral relativism. It shows that characters from the, assumed morally bankrupt, pirate society justify their violence as survival, and are shown to be caring people capable of morality. Similarly it shows the mainland society, which believe itself to be morally upstanding, kill innocents with Reckoners in its policing of piracy. The book ultimately posits that there is no objective standard of morality, and that morality is instead a societal construct. = Queer Romance = Both Cas and Swift are lesbians, with Cas mentioning having had girlfriends in the past and Swift being shown with a woman in her lap after a raid. Depiction of Cas and Swift's relationship is unique in that there is no homophobia in the future depicted in The Abyss surrounds Us, and the two women are never judged or persecuted for their homosexuality. Homosexuality, in their world, is entirely accepted and integrated into society. Their relationship is treated as a normal and uneventful phenomenon. = Climate Change = The Abyss Surrounds Us takes place in a future society that has already experienced catastrophic climate change, an event referred to as \\"The Schism\\", and has been altered significantly because of it. In the opening pages of the book we are give a map of the Neopasific, the Pasific ocean which has expanded deep into continents after the rapid melting of glaciers. We also see global civil unrest and anarchism, with many global powers such as America, China, and India designating into smaller states. The Abyss Surrounds Us also displays the human cost of catastrophic Climate Change. Early in the book the protagonist meets and elderly man who tells her his account of the collapse of a massive sea wall which protected California from rising sea levels, and the millions of deaths and the hardships endured because of it. Many of those effected by the Schism would become refugees and forced to live in floating cities on the Neopasific, such as the Flotilla which Cas visits. The Abyss surrounds us could be viewed as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unmitigated climate change. Reception The novel received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews. The Abyss Surrounds Us was a Junior Library Guild selection. Sequel A sequel, The Edges of the Abyss, was published 18 April 2017.

Howard, published sometimes in itself and sometimes at the beginning of a 1926 story with the same title, dealing with the Pictish King Bran Mak Morn. The poem was first published in 1957 in Always Comes Evening, a collection of Howard poems. The story was included in Bran Mak Morn, Dell Books (1969), and in Worms of the Earth, Ace Books (1979). Summary Men of the Shadows consists of several very loosely connected elements. * The poem \\"Men of the Shadows\\", in which the Picts tell of themselves and their history while taking pride in having been \\"The First Great Nation\\". * A narrative told by a Norse warrior who took up service in a Roman Legion and gained Roman citizenship. He had been among 500 Roman soldiers who traveled north of Hadrian's Wall on a foolhardy mission known only to their commander. The commander and most of his cavalry are killed in repeated Pict ambushes. The narrative begins when thirty surviving Legionaries, of varied ethnic origins, are cornered by a horde of Picts and fight furiously. Though outnumbered, they manage to kill all their adversaries, but only five of them remain. The five try to make their way back to Roman territory, but are killed off one by one. The narrator, left alone, is captured and brought before Bran Mak Morn (in this story, still a chief rather than king). The other Picts want to kill him - being both Roman and Norse, he is twice their hereditary enemy - but Bran Mak Morn decides on sparing his life. The Pictish Wizard accuses Mak Morn of abandoning the old Pictish traditions and especially stopping their practice of human sacrifice by leaving the \\"Temples of the Serpent\\" deserted. Bran Mak Morn and the Wizard wage a mental duel, staring into each other's eyes, which Mak Morn wins. The Pictish chief introduces his captive/guest to his beautiful sister, and recounts how \\"a rich merchant of Corinium\\" had offered a thousand pieces of gold to anyone who would bring him Mak Morn's sister. The clear implication is that capturing her was the secret mission on which the 500 doomed Legionaries were involved. However, this is not pursued further. * Following Mak Morn's victory over the Wizard, the previous story line is cut off, never to resume. The Norse legionary becomes no more than a passive witness, recounting what he heard from the Wizard. The Wizard recites several more pieces of poetry. His hostility of a few minutes before forgotten, the Wizard then strongly hails and praises Mak Morn: \\"Hai! A mighty one has arisen among the Western Men! Hai, hai! A chief has risen to lead the race forward!\\" Thereupon, the Wizard embarks on a long historical exposition, displaying a historical knowledge thousands of years back, a precise prophesy of the Fall of Rome which would occur hundreds of years in the future, and a precise worldwide geographical knowledge including the continents of North and South America. This exposition is similar in style, though very different in detail, to Howard's essay \\"The Hyborian Age\\". Both share the element of the Picts' extreme antiquity and their convoluted history. In the version presented by the Pictish Wizard, they originated in the western part of North America and gradually migrated eastwards. The Wizard concludes by prophesying \\"a new dawn\\" for the Picts - but this would be ephemeral, the decline of the Picts would resume after Bram Mak Morn's death and they would eventually make their last stand in Galloway. There, the story ends. Nothing is told of the eventual fate of the Norse/Roman narrator from the early part, nor is Mak Morn's sister mentioned again.

(Original description) The small, slender, delicate shell is white with a faint suffusion toward the periphery of pale pinkish. It contains ten or more whorls. The spire is acute, a little shorter than the aperture. The protoconch consists of three elevated whorls, milk-white, glassy, smooth, abruptly changing to the adult type of sculpture. The fifth whorl shows seven, the ninth with ten, short axial ribs, chiefly visible on the periphery, crossed by two strong spiral cords, more or less turgid at the intersections. The whorl above these cords is somewhat excavated with a nearly smooth surface except for lines of growth and three or four spiral threads, more distinct and numerous on the later whorls. The base is bordered by a prominent cord on which the suture is laid, giving the effect of a presutural ridge just behind the anal fasciole. On the base there are about 20 more cords with a tendency to alternate in size. The whole surface has minute spiral striae and lines of growth which form a microscopic reticulation only visible with a good lens. The aperture is rounded. The siphonal canal is long and slender. The body is polished and the sculpture eroded. The columella is white, callous, obliquely truncate in front, slightly twisted, not pervious. The outer lip is thin, simple.

Zcash is based on Bitcoin's codebase. It shares many similarities such as a fixed total supply of 21 million units. Transactions can be \\"transparent\\" and similar to bitcoin transactions in which case they are controlled by a t-addr, or can be a type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs; the transactions are then said to be \\"shielded\\" and are controlled by a z-addr. Zcash coins are either in a transparent pool or a shielded pool; as of December 2017 only around 4% of Zcash coins were in the shielded pool and at that time most cryptocurrency wallet programs did not support z-addrs and no web-based wallets supported them. The shielded pool of Zcash coins were further analyzed for security and it was found that the anonymity set can be shrunk considerably by heuristics-based identifiable patterns of usage. Zcash affords private transactors the option of \\"selective disclosure\\", allowing a user to prove payment for auditing purposes. One such reason is to allow private transactors the choice to comply with anti-money laundering or tax regulations. \\"Transactions are auditable but disclosure is under the participant's control.\\" The company has hosted virtual meetings with law enforcement agencies around the U.S. to explain these fundamentals and has gone on the record of saying that \\"they did not develop the currency to facilitate illegal activity\\". On March 1, 2018, an employee named Ariel Gabizon discovered a critical bug which could have allowed an attacker to create an infinite amount of counterfeit ZCash. Gabizon shared this discovery with only three other employees, including Zooko Wilcox, the company's CEO. On October 28, 2018, the fix for this issue was covertly included in the Sapling network upgrade to the Zcash network. On May 19, 2020, a paper titled \\"Alt- Coin Traceability\\" investigated the privacy of both Zcash and Monero. This paper concluded that \\"more academic research is needed in Zcash overall\\" and that the privacy guarantees of ZCash are \\"questionable\\". The paper claimed that since the current heuristics from a 2018 Usenix Security Symposium paper entitled \\"An Empirical Analysis of Anonymity in Zcash\\" still continue today that the result is making ZCash less anonymous and more traceable. On June 8, 2020, Chainalysis added support for ZCash to their Chainalysis Reactor and \\"Know Your Transaction\\" (KYT) technologies. This permits Chainalysis to trace and provide transaction values and at least the sender or receiver address for over 99% of ZCash activity. Chainalysis explains that it is able to accomplish this since most ZCash users do not use privacy-enhancing features. Chainalysis also cites a research paper by the RAND corporation which revealed that less than 0.2% of the cryptocurrency addresses on the dark web were ZCash addresses. On June 30, 2020, blockchain analysis company Elliptic added support for ZCash to their crypto transaction monitoring and wallet screening compliance solutions. According to the developer of ZCash, The Electric Coin Company, Zcash privacy remains strongest of any cryptocurrency, even with Chainalysis, Elliptic support. In Fall 2020, the ownership of Electric Coin Company is in the process of transitioning to a US non-profit called the Bootstrap Project.

Founded in 1932 by W. Charles \\"Charley\\" Geiger Sr., the company markets men's and women's clothing and activewear, shoes, ski and snowboard equipment and accessories, sporting goods and tailored men's clothing at its main store and headquarters in Lakewood, Ohio, and stores in Chagrin Falls, Ohio and downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Charley Sr. ran the business until his death in 1949, when his widow Ottillia and sons, W. Charles \\"Charley\\" Jr. and twins Donald E. and Douglas A. took over. Charley Jr. remained active until his death in 1992, when current CEO W. Charles \\"Chas\\" Geiger was named to the top job. The company's client base includes all of Northeast Ohio, Northwestern Pennsylvania and Western New York. Throughout the years Geiger's has operated satellite locations including Geiger's at Peek'n Peak Resort (Clymer, NY); Geiger's at Boston Mills Ski Area (Peninsula, OH); Geiger's Courtside at River Oaks Racquet Club (Rocky River, OH); the Jack ‘n Jill Shops; and Gordo's Board & Skate, one of the country's first specialty \\"snowboard only\\" retail stores in Lakewood. Geiger's also has an active online business. Early history Photo of the first Geiger's at W. 75 and Lorain Cleveland Geiger's history began nearly a century ago. W. Charles \\"Charley\\" Geiger Sr.'s brother Howard Geiger founded a men's clothing business in Cleveland in 1918 with a store near West 75th and Detroit Avenue in what is now the city's Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood. Charley joined brother Howard in 1919. Howard expanded his business, first to eight stores then, in 1928, to a total of 13 stores, most of which were closed during the Great Depression in 1929–1930. Geiger's staff in 1933In 1932 Charley Geiger Sr., in the midst of the Great Depression, started his own men's clothing establishment, which he named \\"Charley Geiger's Haberdashery\\" in a storefront at the corner of Warren Rd. and Detroit Avenue in downtown Lakewood, OH. In 1936, he moved three storefronts east to 14710 Detroit Avenue where Geiger's main store and headquarters stand today. Geiger's, according to the Lakewood Post, was \\"…a new store, new fixtures, complete stocks of nationally advertised merchandise, and a continuation of the policies that have drastically increased his (Geiger's) business.\\" Sporting goods =Softball= In the 1930s and 1940s, Lakewood, Ohio became a center of world softball. On a site originally owned by the Lakewood Tennis Club, built in 1915 and purchased by the Lakewood Lodge of Elks (BPOE) in 1917, the country's first lighted softball stadium was built. Elks' Field, as it was known, was where the World Softball Championships were played in 1944 and 1946. The location is presently a supermarket. Geiger's began its involvement in sports when it supported the Lakewood Department of Recreation and became involved in the burgeoning adult softball scene. =Other sports= After World War II, Geiger's sponsored hardball teams, Little League and other youth programs as well as winter indoor soccer, basketball, outdoor soccer, major and PeeWee baseball and autumn youth touch football. As the Recreation Department grew, Geiger's involvement became greater and greater, and its men's clothing business operations expanded to include sporting goods. In 2017 Geiger's was named \\"Cleveland's Best Sporting Goods Store,\\" citing \\"...Mom-and-pop shops like Geiger's are what make neighborhoods and communities unique....\\" =Skiing, snowboarding and winter sports= Don Geiger, Charley Jr.'s brother, began the Geiger's ski department in 1961, as skiing in the United States was just beginning to get popular. The 1950s and 1960s then became the greatest growth period in the history of US skiing. Geiger's was a pioneer in the ski outfitting business, one of about 150 establishments, nationwide that have been recognized as the ones who \\"got things started.\\" There were three of these pioneer shops in Ohio, only two survive: Geiger's Lakewood and Geiger's Chagrin Falls. As interest in snow sports increased, Geiger's increased its involvement, adding items like alpine and Nordic skis and ski boots, snowboards and boots, ski and snowboard accessories, and a significant number of brands in men's, women's and children's cold weather clothing and accessories. The company has sponsored many ski oriented programs and outings throughout its history in the ski industry. For many years, Geigers supported former US National Ski champion Jeannie Thoren in her campaign for \\"female- friendly\\" ski equipment. Thoren's position was that women's physical characteristics are completely different from those of men, so just shorter skis will not suffice. Thoren has made many appearances in Geiger's ski stores, urging women to demand and ski manufacturers to design better equipment. Geiger's has been active in America's Best Bootfitters, a worldwide association of independent ski and snowboard retailers that offers certification in the science of fitting ski and snowboard boots. These boots are a substantial investment (up to as much as $1,000/pair) and are integral to good, safe skiing. Executive Vice President and Co-owner Gordon Geiger is very active in snow sports. He is Vice Chairman and has served as Treasurer of the board of directors of Snow Specialists Limited (SSL) one of the leading specialty retail buying associations for ski and snowboarding in the US. The group, founded in 1971, includes more than 60 organizational members who operate over 120 retail outlets in 27 states. His wife Susan has served on the association's Softgoods Committee since 2010. In 2015, Gordon was elected a director of the National Ski and Snowboard Retailers Association (NSSRA). Founded in 1987, NSSRA acts as an advocate on issues like pricing policies, vendor-retailer relationships and provides information that helps its members operate more efficiently and effectively. Historic buildings Charley Geiger Sr. founded the company in 1932 about three storefronts west of the site of the current Lakewood store and corporate headquarters. In 1936, he leased the present store at 14710 Detroit Ave. (which he ultimately purchased) and moved all his goods and store fixtures east. Subsequently, in 1962 the company expanded and purchased an adjacent building to its west. By 1973, Geiger's had knocked down the interior walls and presented the store as one unconnected building – on the inside. The exterior was another matter. In 1975, the company erected a 100 ft. white aluminum façade to make it appear that the two buildings were actually one. The aluminum wall lasted over 25 years, until, early in the 21st century, Geiger's decided to go back to the early 1900s core of the buildings. As they dismantled the old sheet wall, architectural details nearly 100 years old were revealed and emphasized. Architect Rex Gilliland commented that he had simply \\"…put it back to what it was. It looks great.\\" Geiger's headquarters and principal store Geiger's was lauded for its renovation; the city of Lakewood's Jeff Rink stated, we \\"…are excited to have such a fantastic corporate citizen…what they've done is a model for Lakewood to preserve the heritage of historic buildings….\\" In 2002, Geiger's received an Award from the Cleveland Restoration Society and AIA Cleveland for its Lakewood location historic storefront preservation. Children's clothing In 1961, Geiger's purchased Jack 'n Jill, described as \\"Ohio's largest exclusive children's shop,\\" from its founder, Theodore F. Brooks. The Lakewood unit was the only surviving store of a chain of five that Brooks had developed over 25 years. Jack 'n Jill offered a complete line of infants' and children's wear, toys and gifts and a layette department for newborns, managed by a registered nurse. The store, at 15015 Detroit Avenue in Lakewood, featured sleek laminate counters and \\"modernistic\\" fixtures. The Jack and Jill location later closed and a children's department was established in the 14710 Detroit store. Fashion Geiger's has been in the business of fashion for over 80 years, but \\"fashion\\" was not a word used in men's clothing in the 1930s. When Charley Geiger Sr. moved to the store's current location in 1936, it was reported that he had \\"…a knowledge of what interests Lakewood men and boys – and their wives and girlfriends – in the way of haberdashery.\\" In 1980, Geiger's expanded again, this time adding a women's department. Featuring skirts, slacks, blazers, blouses and accessories, the department, \\"Ladies, Ltd.,\\" focused on classic tailoring and clothes. Geiger's has been providing traditional clothing to its customers, offered with its version of customer service for most of its history. Over the years, as the women's department grew, the company moved more and more into more upscale fashion. Geiger's buyers often make purchases with a specific customer in mind. In the 1980s, Geiger's opened a Pendleton Shop in an old home in Rocky River, Ohio. As a part of their contract with Pendleton, Geiger's was required to stock 75% of the merchandise with Pendleton brand clothing and accessories. In 1996, the store moved to larger quarters in the Old River Shopping area, also in Rocky River. Demand grew at such a pace that a second Geiger's Pendleton Shopped was opened in Medina, Ohio on the historic Medina Town Square. In 2005 the Medina store closed and the Pendleton name and affiliation were dropped in Rocky River, although the store still carried some Pendleton brand items, particularly its iconic women's blazers. The store focused mostly on women's traditional clothing. The response was enthusiastic and the store expanded. A unique aspect of the store was its in-house skilled women's tailor, whose expertise in alterations made certain of exact fits. When the Rocky River location finally closed, fashion ladieswear again became a part of Geiger's Lakewood and Chagrin Falls locations. Downtown store Geiger's Downtown Cleveland 2016In May, 2015, Geiger's announced that it would return to its roots, and open a new store in downtown Cleveland, next to a recently opened Heinen's upscale supermarket. Geiger's return would be their first downtown unit since the original Geiger's chain closed in 1929. The store, which opened in November 2015, is in a renovated commercial/residential building at 1020 Euclid Ave. near the corner of 9th and Euclid. Originally the Truman Building, it was renamed The Ivory by its current owners. Constructed in 1911, the Truman Building was designed by renowned architect Willard Hirsch. It is one of eight Hirsch structures that still stand in Cleveland. At the time of construction, this building was built with the most concrete of any building in the country. The building once housed the Oppenheimer & Collins Co. women's clothing manufacturer. In May 2020, after a peaceful demonstration in response to the George Floyd killing, violent rioters vandalized Geiger’s downtown story, stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of outdoor gear, shoes and clothing. The store’s windows were smashed and most of its contents, including décor, were taken. There was serious damage to many of the establishments on Euclid Avenue, although the PlayhouseSquare theaters were unharmed. Community involvement and recognition Charley Geiger Jr. was named Lakewood's \\"Citizen of the Year\\" in 1972. Described as the \\"…most coveted of all awards bestowed on a Lakewood citizen for distinguished service…,\\" the award is provided by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The description of the award, the 33rd given, mentioned Geiger's 16 years service on the Board of Education, his work with Kiwanis, service with the YMCA, the Downtown Merchants Association and the Chamber of Commerce. His efforts, said the award, would \\"…last for generations.\\" The Lakewood Chamber of Commerce, on the occasion of its centennial in 2002, awarded its Frank L. Thurber Award (named after the chamber's first president in 1902) to the Geiger Family. Citing the family's business acumen for over 75 years, the award also lauded the family for its notable history of community dedication, serving on the Boards of Directors for the Chamber of Commerce, First Federal of Lakewood, Lakewood Board of Education, the Beck Center for the Arts, LakewoodAlive, Kiwanis, Rotary, the Lakewood Hospital Foundation and the Cleveland Yachting Club. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, the social service agency that is most renowned for providing help to Cuyahoga County’s homeless population partnered with Geiger’s in a drive to provide the homeless with toys for the children and coats for both children and adults. FrontLine Service also enlisted the aid of nearly 20 companies to motivate their employees and other stakeholders to make the clothing and toy donations at all three Geiger’s stores. Seventy families, including over 200 children who are supported by FrontLine’s young adult, family and veterans programs attended the “Twinkle Shop” where the largess from Geiger’s customers was distributed. Columbus, OH based Heritage Ohio, the state's official historic preservation organization, named Geiger's the 2009 Ohio Main Street Business of the Year for Geiger's involvement in their community, excellence of their physical plant, leading-edge online presence and customer service. Gordon Geiger was honored with the \\"Champion Award\\" of LakewoodAlive, Lakewood's non-profit economic development organization, for his service, particularly as Chairman of the group's Wine and Craft Beer Festival. The Lakewood Board of Education elected Chas Geiger President of the Board (for the fifth time) on 7 January 2008. Geiger served the Board for more than 20 years until his retirement. Chas Geiger was named Vice President of the Lakewood Hospital Foundation in 2011. The Hospital Foundation provides philanthropic assistance to Lakewood Hospital.

He was also responsible for running a massive illegal counterfeit watch operation and at his peak controlled the market and distribution of counterfeit watches in New York by means of blackmail and extortion. He was the official leader of Born to Kill from 1988 until his arrest in 1991, which was the combination of months of investigation by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in conjunction with the aid of a former gang member who defected from the gang and became an undercover informant, helping secure the convictions of David Thai and several of his high-ranking officers. Described as a sly, shrewd and lethal gangster, David Thai fashioned himself as a big brother and the protector to the Vietnamese community in Chinatown. Thai was described by crime writer T. J. English and many others as being well dressed, usually wearing \\"a tailored sports coat, silk shirt and loft leather loafers\\" alongside a pair of sunglasses, and was said to have resembled more a businessman than a gangster. During his interview with Peg Tyre after his arrest on murder charges in 1991 and other interviews that went on in the course of his trial, Thai often stated that he was trying to protect and help the Vietnamese community in Chinatown, often by giving the newly arrived refugees money and a place to live. In his interview with Tyre, Thai went on to describe that he sacrificed his first marriage due to his \\"love for his Vietnamese brothers\\". On October 23, 1992, a United States federal judge in Brooklyn sentenced Thai to life in prison for murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, robbery, extortion, and related offenses. Federal prosecutors claimed that David Thai's life sentence significantly impaired Asian gang activity in New York.  Early life  David Thai was born Thái Thọ HoàngVietnamese names begin with a family name and end with a given name. on January 30, 1956, in Saigon, South Vietnam, where his family lived in a home on Tôn Đản street. As a young teenager on the streets of Saigon, when he wasn't in school, Hoàng often acted as a mediator between the American G.I.s stationed in Saigon who were in search of drugs, and the Bình Xuyên, an independent military group during the time of the Vietnam War that was also responsible for funding and orchestrating many illegal activities in Saigon during the war. When Saigon fell at the end of the Vietnam War, Hoàng's father Dieu was jailed by the triumphant communists and sent into a reeducation camp, but Dieu was still able to secure Hoàng's passage out of Saigon, where he thereafter arrived in the U.S three months later, going by the name David. Initially living in a small house for boys owned by a local Lutheran church in Indiana, in May 1976, David fled from the church house with $150 in his pocket and hopped onto a Greyhound bus destined for New York City. = Life in New York and criminal beginnings= As a young lost youth in New York, David Thai was able to survive in the city by bouncing from job to job, and by various accounts, worked as a busboy in Manhattan restaurants, and was also at one point a dishwasher for the famous Rainbow Room restaurant, located at the sixty-fifth floor of the RCA Building in New York. In his spare time when he wasn't working, David began to dabble into the makings of counterfeit watches by constructing a small counterfeit watch factory in his apartment, an industry that he would later come to dominate a decade later. In 1978, David briefly attended New York University, whereupon he met a fellow Vietnamese refugee from Da Nang who was also a student at the university. The two quickly married, and within months, David's wife became pregnant. Afterwards, both of them dropped out of attendance from the university and moved into a cramped apartment in Hell's Kitchen. Struggling to provide for his family with his jobs as a busboy and dishwasher however, David began making regular trips to Canal Street to delve into financial possibilities, and in 1983, Thai became a member of the Flying Dragons, one of the largest gangs in Chinatown at the time. Because he was Vietnamese however, David and a handful of other Vietnamese members in the gang were cut off from the main gang's lucrative activities, and were forced to form their own sub-group known as the Vietnamese Flying Dragons, whom the Flying Dragons regularly employed to commit the riskiest and most dangerous crimes, since they viewed the Vietnamese as mainly \\"coffee boys\\". Seeing no future or further possibilities of advancing himself within the gang, David left the Flying Dragons sometime between 1986–87 and began to solidify his control over the counterfeit watch industry in Chinatown, whereupon his profits quickly grew. At around the same time Thai was establishing himself in Chinatown's underworld, many Vietnamese youths had begun arriving into the city; the majority of them were boat people who were severed from their families and cast adrift at sea prior to arriving in New York. Upon arrival, however, many of these newly arrived Vietnamese refugees struggled to survive in Manhattan Chinatown, mostly because the majority of the social services in Chinatown as well as the banks catered only to the Chinese, where only Mandarin or Cantonese dialects were spoken, thus forming a language barrier. In addition, due to the absence of previous generations of Vietnamese in New York City, there were no residential places where Vietnamese passed on living areas or apartments from one generation to the next, causing the newly arrived refugees, who could not afford to pay for an apartment on their own, to live on the streets. As David's successful watch business continued to grow, his name became well known throughout the back alleys, pool halls and skating rinks throughout New York that many Vietnamese commonly visited. Hearing stories of a wealthy successful businessman who could take care of his own, many Vietnamese youths began approaching Thai and asked for his assistance, which he usually freely obliged to by giving them money, advice, and at times, a place to live. Eventually, Thai was able to build a small gathering of young Vietnamese men around him, whom he often employed as muscle-men to extort from local shop keepers and merchants on Canal Street, or as assemblers of counterfeit watches in safe houses as part of Thai's growing counterfeit watch business. Before long, Thai and his group began to organize and collectively call themselves the \\"Canal Street Boys\\". Eventually, however, the name \\"Born to Kill\\", a slogan that had originated from the helmets of American GIs from the Vietnam War was gradually used in favor of \\"Canal Street Boys\\", and it would eventually become the gang's official name that news media and state police would come to know them by.  The \\"Born to Kill\\" gang  =Formation= Image of Modern Day Canal Street, the location of the Born to Kill gang's former territory In June 1989, in a Japanese restaurant in Manhattan, David Thai orchestrated the first major gathering of the Born to Kill gang, in which nearly every gang member attended. At the time, the Born to Kill gang and many of the Vietnamese gangs in New York were in general small unconnected groups that each had their own designated gang name and were only loosely affiliated with one another. During this meeting however, David made it strictly clear that all of the many separate Vietnamese factions within the city would go under a single name and banner: Born to Kill, which would override any other name that any of the smaller groups had chosen for themselves. As a result, instead of being a loose confederation of loosely associated gangs, Born to Kill and the Vietnamese gangs in the city coalesced into a single criminal organization that from then on acted under a united hierarchical leadership system, with David Thai as the head or the Anh hai of the newly established collective. In the course of the meeting, David Thai had forced all of the gang members who wished to join the gang to sign a paper contract that was passed from table to table throughout the meeting. The contract mainly emphasized the point that gang members had to swear allegiance to the gang, to never cooperate with police, and most importantly, according to Thai, to never undertake criminal action without the permission of the local gang underboss. David did however, according to the contract, permit gang members to leave the gang, but only under the condition that they scrape their BTK tattoos off their skin and leave the vicinity of New York altogether and never return. = Counterfeit watches = A counterfeit Rolex watch bought in New York City Thai's most lucrative source of income was the sale of fake Rolex and Cartier watches, an industry that he had spent several years trying to monopolize. Thai's primary method of forcing local merchants and shopkeepers in Canal Street to buy his watches was simple; as the leader of a violent band of criminals, Thai didn't need to be subtle: \\"Buy my watches or I'll kill you.\\" On other occasions, David sometimes went out on his own to present himself as a conciliator between the local merchants and his own gang, claiming that he could stop the Vietnamese youths from extorting and robbing their businesses, but only if they purchased his merchandise. In 1988, as Thai's profits grew, New York police became increasingly aware of Thai's illegal watch business; they raided his Canal Street store on multiple occasions. In response, on one instance, when police gathered in front of David's store on Canal Street, Thai ordered his members to shower the police with firecrackers from the top of the building. After several successive police raids however, which Thai claimed to have cost him $100,000, Thai decided to order one of his gang members to blow up a police vehicle. The explosion severely damaged the unattended police vehicle and wounded two officers while eleven bystanders suffered minor injuries. In another instance, when Thai's illegal counterfeit watch business came under the watchful eye of a private investigator named Leech, David was rumored to have put up a contract on Leech's life. In 1989, Thai was charged with criminal possession of forgery devices, being accused of possessing 41 printing stamps which he allegedly used to alter 2,000 wristwatches by falsely imprinting them with brand names such as Rolex and Cartier. Thai's defense moved to dismiss the charges, contending the mere fact that he was in possession of forgery devices failed to prove that he acted with the intent to defraud. Thai's motion to dismiss the charges, however, was denied. When David Thai was finally arrested on murder charges alongside several other indictments, he boasted on the TV program 48 Hours that he made $13 million from the sale of counterfeit watches in 1988 alone. = Double Homicide on Canal Street = On the afternoon of August 5, 1989, as David Thai was standing in front of the shopping mall at the middle of the gang's territory on Canal Street alongside a few of his associates, two members of the Flying Dragons approached Thai and began insulting Thai and the gang. The conflict escalated when one of the Flying Dragons members spat on the sidewalk of Canal Street, a signal of disrespect towards Thai and the entire BTK. In response, Thai went to the back of the Asian Shopping Mall and into the Pho Hanoi restaurant cellar where he then retrieved two hand guns that he then proceeded to hand to two nearby BTK members, telling them to \\"Go shoot those motherfuckers.\\" One of the two BTK members that was given the gun then ran to the front of the shopping mall where the two Flying Dragons had insulted Thai, and in broad daylight on Canal Street, pulled out his .38 caliber pistol and shot dead the two Flying Dragon members, with one of them being shot in the side of the head, while the other was shot through the lung and aorta. Afterwards, the store owners around Canal Street began closing down their stores. Despite the double murder being witnessed by several of the shopkeepers, when law enforcement came, none of them admitted to witnessing it, due to fear of retaliation from the BTK. = Conflict with the Hip Sing Tong = United under the leadership of Thai, the BTK brazenly committed crimes and robberies whenever and wherever they wanted, because according to David, since Chinatown's traditional power structure did not include the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese were therefore not bounded by the rules and laws of the community. The gang had also, as a result of this belief, not sworn allegiance to any particular Tongs or the Triad, unlike many of their contemporary gangs, and as such, frenziedly robbed from establishments that were under control of other Chinatown crime syndicates; on one occasion, a group of six gang members robbed from a gambling den at 1 Catherine Street, in which they stripped several of the customers (including some Tong leaders) in the basement of the gambling den of their cash, jewelry, and credit cards. Sometime in the summer of 1990, David Thai was personally requested to attend a meeting by Kai Sui \\"Benny\\" Ong, the adviser-for-life of the Hip Sing Tong, otherwise known to the Chinatown community as the Godfather of Chinatown or Chut Suk, which translates to \\"Uncle Seven\\". Hearing of the instability of the Chinatown criminal infrastructure caused directly as a result of the BTK's recent activities, Benny Ong demanded a kong su, an underworld slang for negotiation with David Thai, in order to discuss the matter. Presumably, had the meeting taken place, Benny Ong would have offered David the ability to hold onto his rackets and control of Canal Street in exchange of giving up the reins over his gang brothers. Though many in the Chinese community felt that David should've felt honored to attend a meeting with Uncle Seven, David did not respond to Ong's request for a meeting or negotiation. In retaliation, Thai's right-hand man at that point, Vinh Vu, was gunned down at a street corner at 1:00 AM when Vinh and his companion were waiting for a taxi to pick them up from a massage parlor. Funeral of Vinh Vu Vinh Vu's funeral procession took place on July 28, 1990, and lasted over the span of two days in which it was attended by between a hundred-and-twenty-five to nearly two hundred mourners. The funeral service was directed by the Wah Wing Sang Funeral home; the owner of the funeral home claimed that the funeral service was paid by men who did not identify themselves. From the Wah Wing Sang Funeral Home, six pallbearers carried Vinh Vu's coffin accompanied by a crowd of Born to Kill gang members who marched down through the heart of Chinatown, from Mulberry to Bayard Street as some of the gang members paraded openly down Mulberry and Bayard street with the BTK gang banner, which was later folded after a quick scuffle between some of the policemen and gang members in the middle of an intersection. After the entourage made their way around seven or eight of the densest blocks in Chinatown, they abruptly stopped at Canal Street, the main commercial boulevard of Chinatown, where they then loaded Vinh Vu's coffin into a waiting hearse, with the mourners piling into twenty nearby limousines. The entourage then continued towards Holland Tunnel before eventually arriving at the Rosedale Memorial Park Cemetery. At around 2:30 PM, as the mourners gathered around Vinh Vu's casket, which was adorned with the same gang banner that was marched down Mulberry Street during the funeral procession, two or three men, who were dressed just like the mourners approached the crowd and opened fire, wounding five of the mourners and causing the rest to attempt to flee the cemetery in a panic, with a few of the mourners returning fire back at the gunmen. Afterwards, according to the police, the gunmen reportedly escaped from the scene in a red car. The shooting at the cemetery would be widely recorded and subject by the local news media and national press, which mainly focused on the mourners themselves since the identities of the perpetrators were unknown at the time. Knowledgeable law enforcement and outside observers in the community felt that the shooting was orchestrated by Uncle Seven in retaliation for Thai's refusal to participate in negotiations, while Thai believed that the actual shooting was done by members of the Ghost Shadows. =Extortion and murder of Sen Van Ta= In early 1991, David decided that the gang should rob the Golden Star Jewelry store, a store owned by Sen Van Ta located at 302 Canal Street, primarily because Sen Van Ta had recently been refusing to pay extortion money to the gang and because of the close proximity of his store to Thai's massage parlor. On January 21, 1991, several gang members arrived at the store in two separate carloads, where they forced the store employees onto the ground, stole the money and jewelry from the store and beat down some of the employees before fleeing from the scene in a Cadillac. Although the Cadillac was shortly thereafter pursued by police, who then arrested the four gang members in the Cadillac, another gang member, who had not fled the scene using the Cadillac was able to meet up with Thai and deliver him most of the jewelry from the robbery. Shortly after the robberies, Sen Van Ta cooperated with police and identified several of the perpetrators in a line up. In response, Thai took a series of actions in an attempt to prevent Sen Van Ta from testifying; first, David spoke to Ta in person along with several of the employees, in which afterwards he then told his gang members that he had convinced the witnesses not to testify. In another incident, Ta received an anonymous letter containing broken glass and a newspaper article about the robbery, which was a concealed threat that meant the gang might blow up his store. Finally, Thai again approached Ta in person one morning as Ta was starting to open up his store, where Thai heeded Ta to not open his store and instead go to court to say that the four arrested gang members were not the robbers. Ta ignored David's orders and opened the store. In February 1991, as the BTK began their routine of collecting money from merchants alongside Canal Street, the gang members eventually arrived in Ta's store and demanded that he make payments to the gang. Sen Van Ta continued his refusal to pay to the gang, and began reporting these extortion attempts to the police, where he then identified one of Thai's lieutenants along with two other gang members to law enforcement, who then promptly arrested them; they were later released. After Ta's repeated refusal to pay extortion money to the gang, combined with Ta's cooperation with law enforcement that ended with the arrest of several gang members, David Thai decided to hold a meeting with several ranking members of the gang where he declared, \\"This store owner have to be taken out,\\" and referred to Ta as \\"…the one who called the policemen.\\" Eventually, Thai's right-hand man, Lan Tran volunteered to carry the duty of executing Sen Van Ta, which he later carried out on the evening of March 10, 1991. Both Thai and Tran would later be convicted in court for conspiring and murdering Sen Van Ta in 1992.  Arrest and trial  In August 1991, after several months of investigation by a team of ATF agents, and with the critical aid of a former gang member turned undercover informant who, over the span of six months starting from February 1991, leaked inside gang information to the police and wore a wiretape to gang meetings in which he recorded several incriminating conversations, the authorities were able to obtain sufficient evidence to arrest David Thai and 10 members of the Born to Kill gang during a raid of David's house at Melville, Long Island. During the raid, police discovered that Thai was in possession of several unregistered firearms, multiple explosives, and had a counterfeit watch making factory in his basement. After Thai's arrest along with much of the gang's leadership, law enforcement investigating the gang were more easily able to secure third party testimony from numerous victims of the gang, such as the many merchants and shopkeepers that had been extorted from and victimized, since now that they did not have to fear retaliation from the gang if they did so. During the course of his trial which spanned the course of three months, Thai denied that he was the leader of Born to Kill, and asserted that such an organization never existed in the first place, instead claiming that the police had misinterpreted his criminal organization for an organization that merely assisted young Vietnamese refugees who didn't have money or a place to live. Thai's lawyer during the trial, Mr. Murphy, portrayed Thai as a hard working refugee who worked as a waiter to sponsor his brother and sister to the U.S. According to Murphy, Thai's biggest crime was \\"making watches and selling them without a license.\\" Thai's answers and explanations however radically changed by the time that he was interviewed by Peg Tyres, at which point he denied being in New York at all during the time frame when most of the crimes were committed, and instead claimed that, for the last three years, he had been working mostly in Philadelphia where he supposedly worked fixing cars. At the end of the trial, David Thai and several members of his gang were convicted of racketeering. Thai was also convicted on fourteen other counts: one count of conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering, one count of conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering, eight counts of conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery or extortion, two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm and two counts of possession of a firearm without serial numbers. Thai was also ordered by court to pay $413,285 in restitution. = Effects of arrest on Thai's plans = One of the effects of the successful prosecution of David Thai by the ATF was that David Thai would never be able to fulfill his long term plans, such as forging a relationship between his gang and \\"the Italians\\", and his plans of eventually making ties with and uniting the Vietnamese underworld in the U.S, with the hopes of one day establishing himself as its supreme commander.  Public image In October of the same year of his arrest, David Thai granted a special interview to Peg Tyre, a reporter for Newsday who had also covered the rise of the BTK during his time as a journalist. During the interview, which Peg Tyre documented under the heading \\"Suspected Gang Leader Denies Link to BTK,\\" Thai presented himself as a community leader that had been merely trying to provide aid and care for the welfare of his \\"Vietnamese brothers\\" because he too had lived the same lives that they had, and he claimed that he had attempted to gain the assistance of the Vietnamese community to help the young refugees that struggled to survive in the city. Author T. J. English, who had written an entire book devoted to the gang, wrote that \\"Thai always presented himself publicly as a kindly benefactor\\", as evidenced by his seeming concern for the welfare of his gang brothers by offering them money and a place to live, and that \\"He even deluded himself into believing that he was the only powerful person in Chinatown who truly cared about the welfare of his Vietnamese brothers\\", in spite of the fact that he was \\"venal and brutal\\" towards his own gang members and others behind closed doors. As stated in the court trial during Thai's 1994 appeal, gang members that disobeyed orders from their higher ups or members that were suspected to be cooperating with police suffered violent retribution at the hands of Thai and one of his lieutenants. Detective William Oldham who investigated the BTK wrote that \\"Thai built the gang by masquerading as a father figure leading a benevolent society designed to take care of lost and vulnerable boys, and to protect all Vietnamese from the much larger Chinese population,\\" but then compares Thai to the manipulative Fagin from Oliver Twist, pointing out the fact that while the gang members within the gang barely made enough to survive from their crimes, Thai himself drove a Jaguar and lived in a nice comfortable house on Long Island. =Thai's image among gang members= Thai was described by T. J. English as being like a \\"prince presiding over his chosen people\\". Due to his seemingly genuine concern for the welfare of his fellow gang brothers, David was often seen as a godfather or father figure whom many of the young Vietnamese could turn to in times of trouble, either for advice or financially. As a result, many of the gang members within the gang held Thai in supreme reverence, as in the case of Thai's second-in-command, Lan Tran, who referred to David privately in his journal as \\"a model example of a young Vietnamese man.\\" David was also referred to by gang members as Anh hai, a term of clear acknowledgment of Thai's high level of respect, esteem and status within the gang, as \\"Anh hai\\" is a term in Vietnamese that is used to refer to the eldest and traditionally the wisest brother in Vietnamese families. The level of respect and loyalty that gang members had towards Thai was underlined when they used the Vietnamese pronoun em to refer to themselves during conversations with Thai, which is a subservient pronoun in the Vietnamese language.

With the coming of railways in the late 19th century, it largely disappeared. An anonymous art Ōtsu, a port on Lake Biwa just east of the imperial capital of Kyoto, lay at a famous cross-roads for trading routes and particularly the important highway to the administrative capital of Edo. Here and in the villages near it, there developed a tradition of rudimentary folk art that catered to passers-by. It was quickly and cheaply produced, often with whole families collaborating on the work of producing the pictures. Religious and popular themes were originally brushed onto a light clay wash over rough, brownish paper. The pictures were then displayed for sale on roadside stalls and were intended to be attached to doorways or pasted on pillars and sliding doors in the home. Among the techniques used to speed their production was the use of compasses to produce haloes on holy figures and a woodblock to provide the rough outline of a head that was then painted over. The trade seems to have begun sometime in the first half of the 17th century. Buddhist subjects with a protective religious purpose were commonest at first, to which were added themes from folklore which eventually came to prevail. During the 18th century, illustrations were given a moral didactic purpose and explanatory text was introduced about the picture. Often, though, there was a satirical bite: demons were portrayed as monks on alms round, or as taking a bath with a comment inscribed such as “Many wash the body but not the mind”.James Albert Michener, The Floating World, University of Hawaii reprint 1983, Chapter 1, “In the village of Ōtsu” After the foot trade dwindled with the emergence of rail travel, the style lingered on among a few locally and is even having a present-day revival.Philbert Ono, “Otsu-e paintings then and now”, Shiga News, 12 October 2015 Reception From the start, the style was produced by and aimed at commoners. It was dismissed by the sophisticated with cheerful insults, as in Yosa Buson's haiku “Skywards a swallow/ darts and targets with droppings/ the Ōtsue-e below”.Pictures from Otsu Only Matsuo Bashō, with his respectful appreciation of community culture, treated it more sympathetically: “How did it begin,/the brush in Ōtsu paintings,/ with what Buddha’s name?”Robert Aitken, A Zen Wave, 1978, p.179 A blind musician fending off a dog with his crutch Some have claimed Ōtsu-e as an ancestor of the ukiyo-e woodblock prints that replaced them nationally,The Floating World, p.380ff but such printing techniques were not employed there until the 19th century, well after the ukiyo-e style had become popular. However, several artists in the Utagawa school incorporated Ōtsu-e elements into their prints. This is evident, for example, in Utagawa Kuniyoshi’s composite triptych titled Ōtsu-e Paintings Coming Alive;Wikiart or in the popular figures incorporated into Utagawa Hiroshige’s The Bon-odori dance.British Museum One image from this source was particularly popular for its ambivalent meaning. It pictured a blind musician who fends off a dog that is worrying at his trailing clothes. Its original humorously moral purpose was “intended as a warning against being caught unawares, the loose sash representing a 'loose' or unfocused mind. However, around the mid 19th century, the image may have been read as a satire on the declining power of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the blind man representing the government being caught unawares by aggressive foreign powers, symbolized by the dog.\\"Meher McArthur, Gods and Goblins, Folk Paintings from Otsu, Pacific Asia Museum 1999, p.25 Utagawa Toyokuni I made the theme his own in a print of two blind men striking at dogs that bark at their heels.Pinterest Kuniyoshi went further in the series he created under the name Hodomoyoshi, each of which incorporated an Ōtsu-e image in one corner, accompanying his own more dynamic imitation of the scene depicted there.Kuniyoshi Project The theme of the blind man attacked by a dog is reinterpreted as the warrior Shimizu Kwanja Yoshitaka raising his sword at a giant rat that is gnawing the end of the scroll he carries.British Museum In this way Kuniyoshi makes an appeal to the popular tradition of mass production at a time that his own more elegant version was replacing it.

He was a leading authority in the field of criminal law, and was widely known for his legal analyses of some of the deepest social problems in the United States. He was known for his work linking sociological research with legal policies, and limiting academic legal theory with real-world sociological data. He was an advocate for ending criminal prohibitions on private behavior such as drug use, arguing that these laws only made any problems worse. Education and career Kaplan received a bachelor of science degree in physics from Harvard University, then worked in a Naval research lab for several years. He returned to Harvard to attend Law School, was a member of the Harvard Law Review, and graduated magna cum laude. In 1954–5, after his law degree, he served as law clerk for US Supreme Court Justice Thomas C. Clark, then studied criminology in Vienna, Austria. He practiced as a criminal defense attorney then worked in the Department of Justice in Illinois as a Special U.S. Attorney, trying tax fraud cases, commenting \\"it was my method of squaring things with poor people.\\" He then moved to work as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Northern District of California, later commenting on this work, \\"I tried to discourage guilty pleas then, because I loved to try cases.\\" In 1962, he began teaching law at Northwestern University, then at University of California Berkeley. In 1965, he joined the law faculty at Stanford University, where he became the Jackson Eli Reynolds Professor of Law. He wrote notable text books on the legal theory of evidence and on criminal law, as well as publishing both scholarly works and books on social justice. Publications =Scholarly work= Kaplan's Decision Theory and the Factfinding Process (1968) applies decision theory to the judicial factfinding process, not with the end of providing a rigorous mathematical process to make decisions of fact, which he considered unrealistic, but to provide insights into the overall decision process in legal system. United States Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. recommended this article in a footnote of In re Winship, as an \\"interesting analysis\\" of the factfinding process.Justice Brennan, In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970) In Of Babies and Bathwater (1977), Kaplan asserted that jurors mistrust the accuracy of press reports, and assumed their own knowledge of the facts of the case was superior to that of any newspaper reporter.Justice Bauer, United States v. Peters, 754 F. 2d 753 - Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit 1985, The Problem of Capital Punishment (1983) was cited by United States Supreme Court Justice Byron White in Pulley v. Harris, as neatly summarizing the problem in which defendants who are charged and convicted for similar crimes often receive vastly different sentences.Justice White, Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37(1984) =Books= His 1972 textbook,Criminal Justice was adopted at more than 100 colleges nationally. In The Hardest Drug: Heroin and Public Policy (1983), he wrote that drug policies \\"are about as good as we're going to get. .. Heroin maintenance won't work and free availability would be even worse\\", noting that \\"increased law enforcement may not prove very cost-effective. You could send two prisoners to Stanford for the cost of sending one to prison.\\" Teaching Kaplan's colleagues described him as a \\"spellbinding\\" and \\"legendary\\" teacher, who was \\"fast on his feet, funny and got right to the point\\". He was one of the most popular teachers at Stanford University, and taught one its most popular classes - The Criminal Law and the Criminal System, which filled the largest lecture hall on campus and used an innovative (for its time) method of handling overflow by broadcasting the class on the campus radio station. The student press wrote, \\"hundreds of students in his undergraduate and law school classes have loved him for are his humorous and informative lectures, his caring and open attitude, and his lively personality in and out of class.\\" He received the John Bingham Hurlbut Award for teaching excellence. Social science and activism Over his career, Kaplan served on several government committees, advising on drug laws, criminal law, and social issues. As one of the major social scientists of criminal law, he was known as demanding that legal theory confront the hard facts produced by criminological research. He was known as a \\"hard-nosed policy analyst\\" and \\"one of a few legal academics who also had an expertise in policy analysis without ideological preconceptions.\\" In 1985, Stanford University charged Kaplan with investigating allegations of police brutality, after a Stanford student was physically injured after beig arrested by campus law enforcement officials, who used pain compliance holds on students using passive resistance to protest Stanford investment in companies doing business in apartheid South Africa. Kaplan's report was critical of the police hold method, and commended campus security for rapidly changing methods for handling limp protesters. Criticism of the investigation included that the report was prepared prior to meeting with student eyewitnesses, and that when Kaplan and the head of campus police met with student eye-witnesses, the students were not allowed to ask questions at the meeting or see a copy of the report prior to the meeting. In 1989, he chaired the Faculty Senate at Stanford University. Personality Kaplan was known to his colleagues, students, and community for his academic brilliance, teaching skills, activist concern for others, high energy level, and sense of humor. He often appeared in the media, where he was described as \\"pithy, humorous, and incisive\\" and as having a \\"quick wit and exhaustive knowledge of criminal law. Harvard law professor James Q. Wilson said Kaplan was \\"one of the ablest and brightest people I know in the field of criminal justice\\", and additionally was one of the best \\"conversationalists\\" he knew. Colleague and Stanford Law School Dean Paul Brest described him, as \\"a delight and an education, and sometimes a challenge to get words in edgewise.\\" Kaplan lectured to full audiences at Stanford's largest lecture halls with hyperactive and gesticulating lecture style: > Kaplan appears to move constantly, walking casually back and forth across > the stage or in the aisles ... rolling or pushing up the sleeves of his > white shirt, and putting his hands in his pocketsTherapeutic suggestion in > psychopathia sexualis (pathological manifestions of the sexual sense), > November 18, 2009; \\"masturbated ... hand in pocket\\", Albert Philibert Franz > von Schrenck-Notzing, Charles Gilbert Chaddock ... punctuating his lectures > with emphatic gestures, pantomiming questions, answers and comments while > speaking them, and immediately communicating his opinion of any issue. =Sense of humor= Kaplan was known for \\"a crackling wit and a boisterous sense of humor.\\" A former student described Kaplan as \\"a brilliant, often outrageous teacher, who employed humor in an attempt to drive the law into our not always receptive minds.\\" His colleague commented that Kaplan provided \\"the sense of irreverence that we desperately need around the law school.\\" His sense of self-deprecating humor was described as being of the \\"New York type\\" in the Stanford law school newspaper, comparing Kaplan to comedic film director Woody Allen. The student press described him as being the worst dresser on campus, and having a desk littered with books, manuscripts, messages, tape recorders, and professorial odds and ends ... and with Kaplan's feet, which he hastily removed and started putting some papers in the wastebasket. Kaplan replied, \\"I'm usually a complete slob ... my filing system is to throw things out\\" and \\"Oh, well, no one has ever loved me for my looks\\". When asked to teach an antitrust class in which he had no expertise, prior to rapidly becoming an expert on the subject, he wrote in the course guide description, \\"This course will have something to do with antitrust law whatever that is.\\" He once broadcast his Criminal Law mid-term like a baseball game over the campus radio station, with \\"a color commentator, pre-exam warm- up, and interviews with students and TA's after the event\\". He was fond of practical jokes. His colleagues posthumously added this footnote to their criminal Law casebook they coauthored with Kaplan: > The late Prof. John Kaplan was fond of the following classroom hypothetical > [involving attempt, recklessness, and intent]: A very bad person goes to the > roof of a high-rise building, dragging a very heavy potted plant. He pushes > the plant over the edge and down onto a crowded noontime street, but, by > miraculous chance, it does not hit any person. Of what is he guilty? (Extra > credit was given to anyone answering 'littering'.) Personal life Kaplan was born in New York City to Mr. Kaplan and Dorothy Kaplan. He married Elizabeth Kaplan and they fathered three children in Palo Alto, California, Carolyn Springer Kaplan, Jonathan Edward Kaplan, and Jessica Baron Kaplan. He died of cancer after aggressively trying to fight it, undergoing experimental therapy to treat the brain tumor that eventually killed him. Doctors infected Kaplan with a bacterium, in conjunction with other chemicals, to stimulate his immune system in an effort to fight off the cancerous cells, based on experiments on mice showing an 80 percent elimination of brain tumors for a type of tumor that was a different from Kaplan's. Colleague Robert Weisberg commented that Kaplan's motives for undergoing experimental treatment derived from his \\"selfless interest in seeing whether this therapy might work\\" for others.

Adjoining it there is the Salesian Oratory of Don Bosco  History  The church, even if it had been planned in 1577, was built only in 1813 by Company of the Holy Monte di Pietà, near the cemetery of the plague victims which was located in contrada Sant'Ippolito, whose church gave the name to a casale (hamlet) among the oldest ones in Alcamo. After the falling down of the old Church of Sant'Ippolito at the end of the 18th century, there was the need of a new church (1816), which was dedicated to the Holy Souls of Purgatory.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo- Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982 As it was falling, the church was left and the tombs destroyed: the bones and mortal remains were moved to common graves in the cemetery of Spirito Santo and the land was given to the town municipality as a limestone quarry.Tommaso Papa, La Chiesa delle Anime Sante e lo Spirito di S.Giovanni Bosco in Alcamo, Trapani, Vento, 1965. In 1942 it became an autonomous parish; in 1937 they built the clergy house and, in 1964, the crypt under the structure of the present church was consecrated.  the Salesians  The Salesians, founded in 1855 by Saint John Bosco, in order to give instruction to children from poor families, had the approbation by Pope Pius IX in 1874.[3] Since October 5, 1958, the first Salesians (Don Girolamo Giardina, as the Parson, Don Giuseppe Falzone as the Director of the Oratorio and the assistant Antonino Miraglia), inaugurated the long-awaited Salesian Home. After so many bureaucratic difficulties, they succeeded in founding the Oratory Don Bosco (Salesian Centre for Youth) in the premises next to the parish Church of the Holy Souls, which was built by them on the same place of the old 19th-century church.http://www.mgssicilia.com/2014/01/28/voglia-di-oratorio/ During the period of their presence in Alcamo, the Salesians together with liturgical activities, have made several cultural, recreational activities, and above all, theatre for young people: just remember in 2014 an important and successful project which involved a lot of teenagers and educators of the community, Don Bosco the musical. Besides, from 1969 to 1974, they published, under the direction of P.F. Mistretta, a periodical with the title: God's Family, a fortnightly news bulletin of the parish of the Holy Souls and of the Salesian Organization in Alcamo.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.238, Alcamo, Campo, 2001. Since 1928 there is the Congregation of the Third Order of the Carmelites of saint Teresa of Avila: it is still existing and they venerate a statue of Saint Teresa inside the church.  Description and works  The crypt The church with one nave, at first had only an altar, for which the painter Raffaele Genovese (from Palermo) realized in 1854 a great canvas representing the Souls of Purgatory, with Our Lady of Miracles above them, and Saint Rocco e Saint Sebastian at the two sides:Salvatore Messina, Alcamo nella storia, nella leggenda e nell'arte, Alcamo, Campo, 2015. this painting was lost later. Elevated to subsidiary parish in 1919 and autonomous one in 1942, the church was assigned to Salesians in 1958: they demolished it and built the present one, in modern style, after the design of Giacomo Leone, an architect from Catania. Inside the crypt, on the right wall, there is a small statue of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, then a copy of the painting representing the Holy Souls of Purgatory realized by Pietro Novelli and placed on the high altar of the Church of Saint Olivia in Alcamo and a statue of Saint Giovanni Bosco; on the left side there is a statue of Saint Domenico Savio, a painting of Saint Joseph with the Child Jesus, and a statue of the Holy Heart of Jesus. After it there is a statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on a pedestal, while on the high altar you can see a Panel painting, where there are the figures of Jesus behind Saint Giovanni Bosco, Mary, mother of Jesus and various groups of Salesian priests and prelates on both sides, with a lot of angels around.

Their first match took place on 18 June 1963 (before Ali had changed his name from Cassius Clay) and the second on 21 May 1966. Ali won both matches. The first fight was stopped by the referee in the fifth round, and the second in the sixth round. Both fights were stopped after Cooper started bleeding excessively from a cut to the left eye. The first Ali-Cooper bout is remembered for being one of the four fights in which Ali was officially knocked down in the ring by his boxing opponent, as well as leading to the mandate that ringside handlers always have an extra pair of boxing gloves available. Ali (as Cassius Clay) vs Cooper I =Background= After a close victory over Doug Jones, Ali's management decided to match him with Henry Cooper in London. Prior to the fight, Ali called Cooper \\"a tramp, a bum, and a cripple not worth training for.\\" According to Ali, the Cooper fight was only a hiatus before \\"I demolish that ugly bear Liston.\\" Responding to Ali, Cooper said in an interview: \\"Let him carry on. I'm on the gate, he's selling tickets and earning me good money.\\" =The Fight= 35,000 spectators witnessed the first Ali-Cooper fight in the first open-air fight at Wembley Stadium in 28 years. Ali weighed 207 pounds at this time; Cooper was about 20 pounds lighter. Ali also had a 4 1/2 inch reach advantage over Cooper. Round 1 In the first round, Cooper surprised Ali by utilizing offensive tactics, advancing on Ali and firing jabs, right jabs and double jabs. Many of Cooper's stronger punches, particularly the left hook, narrowly missed their mark due to Ali's ability to sway away from an incoming punch. Unexpectedly Ali retired to his corner at the end of the round with a slight trickle of blood flowing from his right nostril. Round 2 In the second round, Cooper continued with his aggressive tactics, but Ali's left jab now started connecting regularly with Cooper's face and a slight cut opened above Cooper's eyes. Round 3 In the third round, Ali connected with a left hook to Cooper's head, and followed this up with a right jab that opened a deep gash above Cooper's left eyebrow. Round 4 In the fourth round, with blood tricking down his face, Cooper continued with his aggressive tactics and started pursuing Ali who now started \\"fooling around\\", moving and throwing only intermittent punches at Cooper. Near the end of the round, Cooper threw three successive jabs as Ali stood against the ropes. Ali retreated further against the ropes when Cooper unleashed a left hook which struck Ali squarely on his jaw, lifting Ali on impact. Two things happened simultaneously at this stage which saved Ali from a possible knockout. First, the round came to an end. Second, the ropes had cushioned Ali's fall. As Cooper later recalled: Round 4 - Round 5 interval Angelo Dundee had to help Ali to his corner at the end of Round 4. Ali was clearly shaken up by the knockdown and was disoriented for a few seconds, attempting at one point to rise from his stool. Dundee appears to pop an ampule of smelling salts under Ali's nose (which would have been a disqualifying offense if he had been caught), although the film is inconclusive. Dundee then waved to referee Tommy Little and showed Little Ali's right glove which had apparently split down a seam revealing horsehair stuffing which could have injured Cooper's eyes. Officials were requested to obtain a new pair of gloves for Ali, and popular myth has it that the resulting confusion led to the interval between round 4 and round 5 to be extended by 20 seconds which gave Ali extra time to recover. In fact, there was no confusion; the referee refused to suspend the fight, and the fifth round was delayed by perhaps three seconds. Round 5 In the fifth round, Ali adopted aggressive tactics himself, throwing a flurry of quick punches at Cooper which resulted in photographers near the ring splashed with Cooper's blood. Two minutes and fifteen seconds into the fifth round, the fight was stopped and Ali declared the winner. =After the fight= Immediately after the fight, Ali retracted the abuses he had directed at Cooper before the fight and declared: \\"Cooper's not a bum any more. I underestimated him. He's the toughest fighter I ever met and the first to really drop me. He's a real fighter.\\" Cooper's left hook which had dropped Ali made him a celebrity after the fight. In Facing Ali, Stephen Brunt writes: According to Cooper: Ali vs Cooper II The second Ali-Cooper fight has been described as being similar to the most one-sided moments of the first without the drama of Ali's knockdown. Ali stayed away from Cooper for the first three rounds as Cooper continued to stalk him. In the next two rounds, Ali allowed Cooper to come closer; but then in the sixth round the fight was again stopped because of a cut over Cooper's eye which started bleeding profusely. Reflecting on the fight Cooper observed: =Viewership and revenue= The bout was fought at Arsenal Stadium, where it drew a live audience of 46,000 spectators. The fight held the record for the largest live audience at a British boxing event, up until Joe Calzaghe vs. Mikkel Kessler drew 55,000 spectators in 2007. On pay-per-view closed-circuit television, the fight drew 40,000 buys in England, where it was shown in 16 theaters, grossing $1.5million ($ with inflation). The fight was telecast at Odeon Cinemas. On pay-per-view home television, the fight drew 40,000 buys, as the first fight on Britain's experimental Pay TV service, at a price of £4, grossing £ ($), equivalent to £ ($) with inflation. The fight was later aired on BBC, where it was watched by 21million viewers in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the fight was broadcast live to 20million viewers via satellite.

She grew up in East Germany, embarking on a public political career only at the time of German reunification. During the final months of the German Democratic Republic she served as president of the . Moving from city politics to national politics, between 1998 and 2002 she served under Chancellor Gerhard Schröder as Minister for Family, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth. More recently, in 2016 she was appointed a member of the Independent Commission for Dealing with Sexual Abuse of Children (\\"Unabhängige Kommission zur Aufarbeitung sexuellen Kindesmissbrauchs\\"), having served as the full-time commissioner during 2010/2011. Early life and education Christine Bergmann, a twin, was born in Dresden. The three siblings with whom she grew up were all brothers. She passed her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") in 1957 and enrolled at Leipzig University (then known as \\"Karl Marx University\\") in Leipzig to study Pharmacy. She passed the relevant exams in 1963 after which, till 1967, she worked as a pharmacist in East Berlin. Career Between 1967 and 1977, Bergmann worked on a freelance basis, employed on the administrative side for the National Journal for Pharmacy, Pharmacotherapy and Laboratory Diagnostics (\\"Zentralblatt für Pharmazie, Pharmakotherapie u. Laboratoriumsdiagnostik\\"). Between 1977 and 1989 she was in charge of the journal's secretarial department. Between 1977 and 1990, she headed up the drugs information department while employed as a research assistant at the National Institute for Drug Administration (\\"Institut für Arzneimittelwesen der DDR\\"). In 1977, Bergmann became a member of the Society for German–Soviet Friendship and of the (East) German Trade Union Federation, remaining a member till 1989. During this time she also worked on her doctorate which she received from the Humboldt University in July 1989 for a study on qualitative and methodical aspects of the effectiveness of drug information provision in East Germany. =Political career= In December 1989, following a series of developments which had opened the way for German reunification, Bergmann joined the newly reconstituted Social Democratic Party (SDP) (in East Germany), which would merge with its West German counterpart (the SPD) in September 1990. In 1990, she was elected deputy regional chair of the party, a position she retained till 1994. Between 1991 and 1998, her political career in Berlin was focused on regional politics. From May 1990 till January 1991, Bergmann was president of the Berlin city council. Between December 1990 and October 1998, she served as junior mayor of Berlin. During this period, voters hadn't given any one party an overall majority in the Berlin senate,\\"Senate\\" is the term used in Berlin for the governing assembly that other cities might term the \\"city council\\" the city was governed by a grand coalition between the centre-right CDU (party) and the moderate-left SPD. During her seven years as mayor, Bergmann accordingly served as deputy to the city's \\"governing mayor\\", Eberhard Diepgen of the CDU. Within the Berlin Senate she held the portfolio for Work, Professional Training and Women. Ahead of the 1994 elections, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping included Bergmann in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as Chancellor.Ferdinand Protzman (August 30, 1994), German Opposition Names Shadow Cabinet in Hopes of Votes New York Times. During the campaign, she served as shadow minister of education and research. In 1998 Bergmann switched to national politics, accepting an appointment in the Schröder government as Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, in succession to Claudia Nolte. She had already shadowed the portfolio in opposition under the SPD party leadership of Rudolf Scharping. In 1998, less than a decade after reunification and in comparison to its CDU predecessor, Gerhard Schröder's government was short of leading members from the \\"New Federal states\\": Christine Bermann was the only member of the First Schröder cabinet who had grown up in the old German Democratic Republic (East Germany). She oversaw a number of improvements in the tax treatment of families and significant recalibration of Child Allowance (\\"Kindergeld\\"). Bergmann pressed for the legalisation of prostitution and introduced legislation on parental leave. Her reputation was for competence, with a tendency to avoid the limelight. She was once quoted as saying of herself that she was not inclined to self-promotion (\\"Ich neige nicht sehr zur Selbstdarstellung\\"). Bergmann retired from the government in 2002, but returned to politics in 2004, working with Kurt Biedenkopf as an ombudswoman, observing the impact of the \\"Hartz\\" labour market reforms, with a mandate to advise government and parliament on any recommended revisions to it.

Best known for his work with homemade idiophones in his Steel Cello Ensemble, Rutman is regarded as a pioneer of multimedia performance in his mixing of music, sculpture, film, and visual art. Biography =Early life and career= Born in 1931 Berlin, Rutman's mother was a Jewish actress and his father a Bulgarian brownshirt who died in 1933. When the Third Reich came to power, he and his mother fled Germany, moving to Warsaw in 1938 and then to Finland just before Hitler invaded Poland. By way of Sweden, Rutman arrived in England in 1939 where he attended refugee schools throughout the Second World War. After completing his studies in 1950, Rutman moved to New York City in 1950, then had to return to West Germany for military service in 1951. In 1952 Rutman returned to the U.S. and worked as a traveling salesman in Dallas, Texas, before moving to Mexico City to enroll in art school. He married in Mexico and had a son, Eric. In 1962 Rutman returned to New York where he opened a gallery on Charles Street called \\"A Fly Can't Bird But A Bird Can Fly\\", which presented poetry, theater, music, and visual art as multimedia events. Rutman's collaborators included Beat poet Philip Lamantia, who mentions Rutman in his poem, \\"The night is a space of white marble\\", and sculptor Constance Demby, with whom he made his first sound sculptures in 1966. In 1967 Demby and Rutman held several happening-style events that mixed sonic, visual, and performance art centered around big sheets of metal that the artists had found. In one piece called \\"The Thing\\", Rutman wore a white cardboard box and banged on Demby's sheet- metal creation with \\"a rock in a sock.\\" In another piece entitled \\"Space Mass\\", Rutman projected film upon a piece of curved sheetmetal onto which Demby had welded several steel rods that she played as a percussion instrument. Rutman later remarked, \\"We thought it would sound good as a xylophone, but it didn't.\\" Rutman would later make adjustments to the sheet metal-and-rod contraption, converting it into a fully playable and tunable idiophone. =Central Maine Power Music Company= In 1967 Rutman moved to Skowhegan, Maine where he built a house in the woods and established another multimedia gallery. Though this gallery sent him into bankruptcy within its four years of operation, it was here that Rutman created the instruments for which he became known. Rutman made these new instruments from large panels of flexible sheet metal affixed with steel strings or freely swinging rods that he played with a bass or cello bow. He named one of his creations the steel cello, and another the bow chimes, describing both as \\"American Industrial folk instruments\\". In 1970 Rutman founded the Central Maine Power Music Company (CMPMC) as his first ensemble to play these sculptures. The CMPMC included Rutman and Demby, with locals Hugh Robbins, Richie Slamm, and Sally Hilmer, plus hammer dulcimerist Dorothy Carter and other occasional guests playing Rutman and Demby's bowed sheet metal creations. Rutman's original concept for the group was to have it be made up entirely of handmade instruments, and the group did feature a configuration of circular sawblades used as percussion. But according to Rutman, his invented instruments ended up serving more as decorations for their performances, as the other members of the group brought in traditional eastern and western instruments, such as drums, electronic organ, flute, koto, saxophone, tamboura, and yang chin, as well as electronic musical novelties, including the Moog synthesizer and theremin. CMPMC performances had a ritualistic quality that incorporated many non-musicians, such as video artist Bill Etra who added visual elements to their shows. The band toured the East Coast, playing at several planetariums in Massachusetts, as well as Lincoln Center, the World Trade Center, and at the United Nations Sculpture Garden in New York. Rutman told a reporter in 1974: > The best way to describe our music is to call it \\"not music.\\" You see, it > often happens that when people hear us play, they say, either in anger or in > delight, \\"That's not music!\\" It's somewhat akin to the paintings of Jackson > Pollock. When the art buffs first saw his work, with the paint drippings and > all, they said, \\"That's not painting.\\" =Steel Cello Ensemble= Steel cellos at the 2018 Rudolstadt Festival in Germany As Rutman's instruments piqued the interest of aficionados in both visual art and new music composition, his portfolio as an exhibition and concert artist grew. As art pieces, the steel cello and bow chimes toured to galleries and museums where bows were on hand for anyone to play them. Though his instruments were tunable, Rutman had no formal musical training aside from sporadic childhood piano lessons. With neither conventional tuning principles nor systems of notation, it was through alternate means that he began teaching many people to play his instruments. He moved to Boston's then-bohemian Cambridgeport neighborhood and disbanded the CMPMC to found a new, all-steel music group in 1976: the Robert Rutman U.S. Steel Cello Ensemble, whose members included Suzanne Bresler, Rex Morrill, Warren Senders, Jim Van Denakker, and David Zaig. A 1977 press release described the group and its instruments: > The steel cello is 8ft tall and is made from a sheet of stainless steel > anchored into a heavy iron stand. It supports one string, which when bowed > creates a multitude of resonances, from delicate brittle sounds to deep rich > tones. The bow chime, which is shorter, forms a horizontal curve which > supports vertical rods, which when bowed produce complementary metallic > tones. The Ensemble consists of one steel cello and three bow chimes and > together create sounds equal in dynamics to an orchestra. The Ensemble toured North America, often playing at science museums and art spaces, as well as concert venues. In 1977 they performed at Harvard University's Science Center and at New York's Museum of Modern Art. To further document and promote his work, Rutman founded his own label, Rutdog Records, on which he released albums by his Steel Cello Ensemble. Rutdog also released Dorothy Carter's psych-folk album Waillee Waillee, on which Rutman backs the hammer dulcimerist on his steel cello. Rutman and Carter continued to collaborate for decades thereafter. Rutman's instruments were borrowed by American jazz musician Sun Ra during his 1978 residency at the Modern Theater in Boston; Sun Ra (rather unsuccessfully) attempted to play both the Bow Chime and Steel Cello during the concerts. http://www.warrensenders.com/journal/hanging-out-with-the-man-from-saturn/ In the 1980s Rutman and his instruments began scoring theatrical works by Euripides, Shakespeare, Coleridge, Rilke, Thoreau, and others. In 1980 the Steel Cello Ensemble performed for Peter Sellars' Harvard University stage production of King Lear, and in 1985 worked with Laurie Anderson on Robert Wilson's rendition of Alcestis at the American Repertory Theatre. That same year Rutman was invited to play at prominent venues in the European cities he had lived in as a child, and he gave concerts at the Berlin Atonal, London's Institute of Contemporary Arts, and Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science. In 1989 Rutman threw himself a farewell party in Cambridge before relocating to his birth city of Berlin where he continues to live and make work. In an interview given shortly before leaving the U.S., Rutman shared his perspective on his instruments and music: > I see the music as the American industrial. They are the product of our > society...indigenous American instruments. They really reflect the sounds of > our society, and the engines and drones and stuff like that. The indigenous > properties of the instruments have a western harmonic tonality, like a brass > horn. They produce this brilliant, harmonic, metallic sound. It's what > electronic instruments want to do and really can't in the way that the steel > cellos can do. It creates the environment that's both ancient and futuristic > at the same time. It spans this whole sense of space and future and past. > That's what's inherent in the sound of the instrument. =Further developments= Over the years, Rutman developed an interest in Tibetan meditation and music. He spent five years teaching himself to throat sing in the style of Tibet's Buddhist monks and began to match his instruments low tonalities with his own voice. He also re-incorporated traditional non- western instruments into Steel Cello Ensemble performances and recordings, including the tabla, Tibetan horn, and didgeridoo. Because of the steel cello's mass, Rutman developed lighter weight instruments for impromptu shows. First came the buzz chime, a triangular wooden drone instrument, which he added to his Steel Cello Ensemble. In the 1990s he satirized his own work by creating the styrophone, a handheld instrument that mimicked the appearance of his bow chimes, but instead of its five protruding brass rods being affixed to steel, they appeared as spindly wires stuck into blocks of styrofoam. Unlike his sheet-metal instruments, which can last indefinitely, each Styrophone is destroyed by the process of playing it. Rutman told an interviewer in 2013: > The styrophone is the exact opposite to the bow chime and the steel cello, > which make a very full sound. Instead, the styrophone is like Gänsehaut! > It’s the opposite of beauty, it’s like really ugly and I like that. Throughout the 1990s Rutman continued to score theatre and film, including Wim Wenders' sequel to Wings of Desire and Heiner Goebbels' stage adaptation of Walden. He toured and recorded with German industrial music group Einstürzende Neubauten and also played on albums by Meret Becker, Alexander Hacke and Swans. Dresden's Stahlquartett (\\"Steel Quartet\\") playing steel cellos at the 2018 Rudolstadt Festival Rutman's training of other musicians has also spawned new generations of steel cellists and bow chimers, many of whom have gone on to compose and perform on the instruments. Among these are Klaus Wiese's Nono Orchestra, Wolfram Spyra and Pete Namlook as the duo Virtual Vices, Mathias Grassow and Adrian Palka. Other sculptor-musicians have designed and constructed their own variations of Rutman's instruments, such as the Dresden- based steel cello ensemble Stahlquartett. Rutman's instruments are in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Instruments similar to Rutman's steel cello and bow chimes have continued to appear in Constance Demby's work as \\"The Whale Sail\\" and \\"The Space Bass\\". Demby maintains that Rutman's instruments are adaptations of her own. Visual art In addition to his music and instruments, Rutman continues to produce and exhibit drawings, oil paintings, engravings and wire sculptures, examples of which can be seen on his website. His influence is in the work of Jackson Pollock and abstract impressionism, and he is best known for depicting landscapes, nude figures, Catholic themes, and chairs.

Until 1918 Nagysalló was part of the Kingdom of Hungary; nowadays it is a village in Slovakia, its Slovakian name being Tekovské Lužany. This was the second battle in the second phase of the campaign, whose aim was to break the imperial siege of the fortress of Komárom and at the same time encircle the Habsburg imperial forces headquartered in the Hungarian capitals of Buda and Pest. The Hungarians routed the imperial corps led by Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth, which had come from the Habsburg Hereditary Lands (Vienna, Styria, Bohemia, Moravia), to help the imperial army sent to suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and independence. Background After the Battle of Vác the Hungarian army continued its advance in accordance with the plan for the second phase of the Spring Campaign as developed on 7 April.. According to this plan the Hungarian army was to split: General Lajos Aulich with the Hungarian II Corps, and Colonel Lajos Asbóth's division remained demonstrating in front of Pest to make the imperials believe the whole Hungarian army was there; this would divert the Imperials’ attention from the north, where the real Hungarian attack was to start with I, III and VII Corps moving west along the northern bank of the Danube via Komárom, to relieve it from the imperial siege.. Kmety’s division of VII Corps was to cover the three corps’ march. After I and III corps had occupied Vác, Kmety was then to secure the town while they and the two remaining divisions of VII Corps were to advance to the Garam river, then head south to relieve the northern section of the Austrian siege of the fortress of Komárom.. After this, they were to cross the Danube and relieve the southern section of the siege.. In the event that all of this was successfully completed, the imperials had only two choices: to retreat from Middle Hungary towards Vienna, or to face encirclement in Pest and Buda by the Hungarians.. This plan was very risky (as was the first phase of the Spring Campaign too) because if Windisch-Grätz discovered that there was only one Hungarian corps left in front of Pest, he could attack and destroy Aulich's troops, thus easily cutting the main Hungarian army's lines of communication, and even occupy Debrecen, the seat of the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament and the National Defense Committee (the interim government of Hungary), or alternatively he could encircle the three corps advancing to relieve Komárom.. The region in which the Battle of Nagysalló took place in a map from the middle of the 19th century Although the president of the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), Lajos Kossuth, who went to the Hungarian headquarters at Gödöllő after the battle of Isaszeg, wanted a direct attack on Pest, he was finally convinced by the Hungarian commander-in-chief, Artúr Görgei that his and the other generals’ plan was better.. To help to ensure the Hungarian army's success, the National Defense Committee sent 100 wagonloads of munitions from Debrecen.. In the Battle of Vác on 10 April the Hungarian III Corps under General János Damjanich defeated Ramberg's division led by Major General Christian Götz, who was mortally wounded.. Even after this battle, the imperial high command under Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz was unsure whether the main Hungarian army had in front of Pest or had already moved north to relieve Komárom. They still believed it was possible that only a secondary force had attacked Vác and moved towards the besieged Hungarian fortress.. When Windisch-Grätz finally seemed to grasp what was really happening, he wanted to make a powerful attack against the Hungarians outside Pest on 14 April, then to cross the Danube at Esztergom and cut off the force which was marching towards Komárom. However, his corps commanders, General Franz Schlik and Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelačić refused to obey his orders, so his plan which could have caused serious problems for the Hungarian armies was never realized.. Windisch-Grätz sent the order to Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth to use the reserve corps formed from available imperial troops from Vienna, Styria, Bohemia and Moravia to stop the Hungarian army's westward advance to Komárom.. But by the time this happened, Windisch-Grätz was no longer in Hungary, because in the meantime on 12 April he was relieved of his command by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria Feldzeugmeister Ludwig von Welden, the former military governor of Vienna, was designated to replace him but until Welden arrived, Windisch-Grätz had to hand over to Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelačić as interim commander-in-chief of the imperial armies in Hungary.. But this change at the head of the imperial forces brought neither lucidity nor organization to the imperial high command, because the first thing Jelačić did at the start of his appointment was to call off Windisch- Grätz's plan of concentrating the imperial armies around Esztergom, without giving this not unpromising plan a chance.. Görgey, who had installed his headquarters at Vác after the battle from 10 April, ordered Damjanich's III Corps to advance towards Léva on 11 April and Klapka's I Corps to do so on the 12th. Their place in Vác was taken by VII Corps under András Gáspár, then after that followed them, Vác was occupied by Kmety's division.. Prelude Wohlgemuth and his three brigades neared the Vág and Garam rivers, being joined by a brigade from Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich's division and the Jablonowski division defeated at Vác some days earlier. Welden was sure, that this Austrian army corps, now containing around 20 000 men, would stop the Hungarian advancement.. But the contradictory orders given by Welden and Jelačić prevented the corps from arriving in time in the vicinity of the Garam.. On 17 April Welden ordered Jelačić to march towards Vác and link up with Wohlgemuth, but the Croatian ban was reluctant to obey, only agreeing to move on 20 April (a day after the battle of Nagysalló actually took place).. Damjanich János Ludwig von Wohlgemuth Meanwhile, on 15–17 April the Hungarian army consisting of I and III Corps and two divisions of VII Corps arrived at the Garam, under Görgei's overall command. He sent a detachment of 2,300 soldiers and 10 guns north under the command of his older brother Ármin Görgei to occupy the so-called Mining Towns (including Selmecbánya, Körmöcbánya, Besztercebánya), and to cover against an attack from the north.. Görgei also ordered the three corps to build bridges across the Garam in three separate places. Because I Corps's bridge was finished quickly, while work on the other two was progressing very slowly, on the 18th Görgei ordered that III Corps should also cross on the I Corps bridge at Nagykálna, leaving only VII Corps on the east bank trying to finish its bridge at Zsemlér. Then I and III Corps advanced southwest.. On the same day Nagysalló was occupied by Dessewffy's division of I Corps.. Wolgemuth's Austrians were positioned as follows: Veigl's brigade at Bese, Herzinger's at Cseke, Strastil's and Dreyhann's brigades of Jablonowski's division together with Theissing's brigade at Nagymálas, and Perin's at Köbölkút.. In a letter to the high command written at midnight on 16 April he reported the Hungarians’ strength as 24,000 men with 48 guns, among them a 12-pounder battery, and that their purpose was to advance towards Komárom. This shows that his reconnaissance had been quite good, giving him fairly accurate knowledge of their strength and intentions.. In the same letter he wrote that he hoped they would be slow to cross the river, as he wanted to confront them before they reached Nyitra.. Welden replied that he should attack the Hungarians, thinking that this would boost the imperial soldiers’ morale and demoralize the Hungarians.. Welden had also heard about the possibility of intervention by the Russian Empire on behalf of the Habsburg Empire to crush the Hungarian War of Independence, and that some of the czar's troops had already entered the Habsburg province of Galicia, in case the Austrian situation became hopeless.. But Welden did not want the Austrians to suffer the shame that they could only defeat the Hungarians with Russian help: What we can achieve with our own power is more than the brightest result which we can achieve with foreign help.. This was also one of the reasons he was urging Wohlgemuth to do battle with the Hungarians.. Battle At dawn on 19 April, Wohlgemuth ordered Strastil's brigade to attack Nagysalló, which it accomplished, chasing Klapka's vanguard out of the village.. Klapka decided to retake the place, and also informed Damjanich about this.. The Battle of Nagysalló around noon. The action began at 10 o'clock with a heavy artillery duel, then after an hour of fighting, two divisions of Hungarian I Corps finally forced Strastil to retreat with a bayonet charge.. The imperial brigade retreated to the southwest of Nagysalló.. Wohlgemuth ordered it to counterattack, also sending Dreyhann's brigade from Nagymálas in support. The two brigades entered the village but were pushed out.. Major General Felix Jablonowski ordered them to retreat to the heights southwest of the village.. At this moment the Hungarian right wing was attacked by Herzinger's brigade from Cseke, which swept away the Hungarian Dipold brigade and pushed it back to the Hölvény wood (outside Nagysalló). But here Bobich's brigade stopped them, while the retreating Hungarian brigade also halted and regrouped.. Here these two brigades were taken charge of by Major General Richard Guyon (who was not supposed to participate in the battle, because he was designated as the new commander of the besieged troops of Komárom, he just wanted to fight and help his army to obtain victory).. Under Guyon's lead, the two Hungarian brigades forced Herzinger to retreat.. The military actions in the Battle of Nagysalló 19.10.1849 Around 3 o'clock the Hungarians began a general attack led by János Damjanich. Seeing his troops’ lack of success, Wohlgemuth was thinking of retreating, but he was waiting for Veigl's and Perin's brigades advancing from Bese and Köbölkút towards Jászfalu, to join his main body. However, at this very moment the cavalry of the Hungarian VII Corps, led by Colonel Ernő Poeltenberg appeared on his right flank.. VII Corps had started to cross their bridge over the Garam at Zsemlér as soon as it was ready, at 7 o'clock in the morning. Hearing the gunfire, Gáspár urged his troops to hurry across and join the battle. He ordered them into battle to the left of Nagysalló: the artillery and cavalry to support III Corps, with Poeltenberg's brigade in Nagysalló to observe the road towards Zselíz.. Those of his troops who crossed after this also marched towards Nagysalló. Two Hungarian battalions tried to outflank the village from the left, forcing the remaining imperial troops to retreat from it. The Hungarian artillery fired so effectively upon the enemy artillery that this was forced to retreat.. The retreating imperial artillery tried to redeploy further back, but after the VII Corps sappers had bridged two ditches for it, the Hungarian artillery advanced and drove the imperial guns away again.. Thus the 4th Sándor Hussar Regiment led by Poeltenberg, together with the cavalry of III Corps under General József Nagysándor, and a horse artillery battery obliterated the imperial cavalry on the right flank... The Austrians retreated to Nagymálas, pursued by the Hungarian army.. Here the cavalry attacked again, while some of the infantry and a battery outflanked the village from the left, and two half-batteries advanced on the road.. At that moment an imperial battalion charged out of the Nagymálas woods, but the Hungarian artillery fire shattered them and drove them into the village.. Because the imperial troops gathered in Nagymálas were being bombarded from the front and flanks, they retreated from the village and took position behind it.. Chasing the fleeing imperials at Nagysalló Than The Hungarian vanguard was being led by Lieutenant-Colonel Lajos Zámbelly, the VII Corps chief of staff who sent two battalions into the woods near the village to attack the flank of the imperials fighting there.. Meanwhile, Gáspár commanding the left wing linked up with Zámbelly's units and entered Nagymálas, driving the imperials out and chasing them to Farnad. Here the Hungarian artillery again took the leading role and bombarded the enemy who split into two groups, one fleeing to Jászfalu, the other to the woods around Cseke.. Then the larger group was pursued by the III Corps cavalry and the smaller by Zámbelly's troops with three squadrons of Sándor hussars, taking around 1,000 prisoners.. The left wing of the imperial army could not participate in the battle because Wohlgemuth failed to withdraw his troops at the right time.. But the four brigades he did bring into action fought very bravely.. Görgey did not lead his troops in the battle, but let his corps commanders operate freely, without his direction.. Despite that, this battle demonstrated that the Hungarian army could fight in a perfectly coordinated way, without committing the mistakes of the previous battles when different officers showed varying degrees of initiative when faced with unexpected situations, as for example in the Battle of Isaszeg. In this battle (Nagysalló) Klapka, Damjanich, and Gáspár, three generals with very different temperaments (Damjanich being very impulsive, taking instant decisions in battle and acting on them without regard for the risk; Klapka, an old fashioned Habsburg-type general, who attached great importance to the safety of his troops;. and Gáspár, who was sometimes inclined to obey his superiors’ previous orders, even when the situation on the ground demanded that he act differently for the sake of the battle..) showed perfect coordination and the ability to make the right decisions when the situation required, which ensured success for the Hungarian army.. The cavalry also excelled in its pursuit of the fleeing enemy at the end of the battle.. This is why the Battle of Nagysalló is considered one of the best executed battles of the Hungarian Independence war... Aftermath The imperial losses were heavy. While Wohlgemuth reported 112 dead, 195 wounded and 1,243 missing, the Hungarian military reports just of Austrian prisoners show no fewer than 1,200 men. The Hungarian VII Corps alone reported capturing 5 officers, 1 chief medical officer and 500 soldiers.. Hungarian sources give the imperial losses as 2,000 men. The Hungarian losses were given by György Klapka as 600, and by Richárd Gelich as 700.Bánlaky József: A magyar nemzet hadtörténete XXI, Magyarország 1848/49. évi függetlenségi harcának katonai története Arcanum Adatbázis Kft. 2001 Görgey was satisfied with the result of the battle, writing afterwards: The morale of our troops is quite excellent. This victory enthuses and inspires all defenders of the homeland, who endure and suffer all the vicissitudes and hardships of the war, and look to the events of the future with high spirits.. The news about the Hungarian Declaration of Independence from 14 April 1849, arrived to Görgei's camp. Although he was against this step of the Hungarian political leaders, and in the future this caused serious conflicts between him and Lajos Kossuth, right after the battle of Nagysalló, he declared, kind of joking, referring to both these events (the declaration of the Hungarian independence and the battle of Nagysalló): I am sure that when the gentlemen in Debrecen [the political leaders of Hungary, led by Kossuth] hear the news about this victory, they will declare war even to the Tzar of Russia.Hermann Róbert: Kossuth és Görgei Iskolakultúra 1998/3, pp. 89 This defeat forced Wohlgemuth not to lead his army towards Komárom, where he planned to join the besieging Austrians, but to retreat towards Érsekújvár.. Two days after the battle, on 21 April, the first Hungarian units entered Komárom, ending the imperial blockade on the northern side of the fortress.. On the 24th Lieutenant General Balthasar von Simunich informed Lieutenant General Anton Csorich that the Hungarians had repaired the bridge across the Danube, and had started to cross the river on it and on rafts. He therefore asked Csorich to bring his troops to Herkálypuszta by the morning of 25 April at the latest, to help him against the Hungarian attack.. Next day, on the 26th, the Hungarian troops attacked the besieging imperial army from Komárom, which ended in the Austrian army retreating towards the west, so the main aim of the Spring Campaign – the liberation of the western part of Hungary – was achieved.. The victory of Nagysalló brought about significant results. It opened the way towards Komárom, bringing its relief to within a couple of days.. At the same time it left the imperials incapable of spreading their troops out enough to cover the very large front which this Hungarian victory created, so instead of uniting their forces around Pest and Buda, as they planned, Feldzeugmeister Welden had to order the retreat from Pest, as he was in danger of being caught in the Hungarian pincers.. When he learned about the defeat, on the morning of 20 April, he wrote to Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich, the commander of the forces besieging Komárom, and to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, the Minister-President of the Austrian Empire, that in order to secure Vienna and Pozsony, against a Hungarian attack he was forced to retreat from Pest and even from Komárom.. He also wrote that the morale of the imperial troops was very low, and because of this they could not fight another battle for a while without suffering another defeat.. So the next day he ordered the evacuation of Pest, leaving a substantial garrison in the fortress of Buda to defend it against Hungarian attack. He ordered Jelačić to remain in Pest for a while, and then to retreat towards Eszék in Bácska where the Serbian insurgents allied with the Austrians were in a grave situation after the victories of the Hungarian armies led by Mór Perczel and Józef Bem..

Career Educated at German and American Universities, Diermeier started his career as an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University before joining the Department of Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. There he was the IBM Professor of Regulation and Competitive Practice and, later, director of the Ford Motor Company Center for Global Citizenship. He won multiple teaching awards including Professor of the Year Award in 2010, and Alumni Professor of the Year Award in 2013. From 2014 to 2016, Diermeier served as Dean of the Harris School of Public Policy as well as the Emmet Dedmon Professor at the Harris School and The College at The University of Chicago. Under his leadership the Harris School increased the number of students and faculty, expanded key areas of scholarly research and led fundraising efforts for the renovation of the award-winning the Keller Center. As Provost at UChicago, Diermeier was responsible for the academic and research programs, allocation of space across campus, and the University’s operating budget. In 2016 he reformed the University’s budgetary process. In October 2019, he announced a new funding model for doctoral education in the Divinity School, Division of the Humanities, Division of Social Sciences, and School of Social Service Administration, beginning in the 2022-23 academic year. The new model was based on three principles. First, all enrolled Ph.D. students will be funded for the duration of their program at the guaranteed stipend level. Second, teaching by Ph.D. students will be structured as mentored teaching experiences and separate from funding. Third, all funded divisions will have a total program size—the total number of PhD students across a particular school or division will be a fixed number, and new students will not be admitted until currently enrolled students graduate or leave their program. At the same time, the University expanded resources to support doctoral students in mentoring and in preparing them for non-academic post-graduate careers. Another signature achievement during his tenure was launching the Diversity & Inclusion Initiative which included a campus-wide climate survey and programs to improve the faculty pipeline of underrepresented minorities and women. On December 4, 2019, Diermeier was announced as the ninth Chancellor of Vanderbilt University, beginning July 1, 2020.https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/12/04/daniel-diermeier-ninth-chancellor/ Diermeier is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a research fellow at the Canadian Institute of Advanced Research (CIFAR).

That year, the Chairman of the Board was Christophe Ampouam and Director was Jean-Marie Aléokol Mabiemé. Both were still in those roles in 2007 and 2008. Special Olympics Cameroon officially launched major programming in 2007. Headquarters for the organization are in Mvog Ada, a neighborhood in Yaounde.  History  Special Olympics first arrived in Cameroon in 1995, with the goal of assisting people with intellectual disabilities to fully integrate into Cameroonian society. Special Olympics Cameroon has delegations to the Special Olympics World Games. In 2006, Special Olympics Cameroon sent a team to Spain to compete in the Spanish Special Olympics National Games. The team earned a bronze medal. That year, a trainer came from the Ivory Coast to work with football coaches and trainers who work with sportspeople with intellectual disabilities to demonstrate how they can be better integrated into football programs. In this period, they were member of the Cameroonian Sports Federation for People with Disabilities (FECASH). Special Olympics Cameroon was supposed to send a delegation in 2011 to Athens World Games. One of the members of the team would have been track and field competitor Salomon Oyono. In 2007, Aléokol launched the \\"Football for Hope\\", a two-year program in 2007 to teach 250 people with intellectual disabilities about football. The program was supported by Cameroonian Football Federation (Fécafoot) and Special Olympics Cameroon. In establishing this program, Aléokol hoped to have enough players ready to potentially compete in the 2010 ID Football World Championships.

Bancroft (1834-1903), Denver physician and public health advocate Frederick J. Bancroft (May 25, 1834 – January 17, 1903) was a surgeon during the Civil War before he settled in Colorado, where he was considered to be \\"one of the most prominent physicians\\", according to a San Francisco Chronicle obituary. In the late 1870s, he and the Denver Medical Association created the public health system for Denver, Colorado to improve the health of its citizens. In 1876, Bancroft was the first president of Colorado's State Board of Health. He became Colorado Medical Society president in 1880. Bancroft was a founder and professor of the University of Denver and Colorado Seminary Medical Department in 1881. Bancroft advocated for public health measures to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and licensing prostitutes to reduce the prevalence of syphilis. He was concerned about the public health issues due to a lack of sewage systems, regulation of the distance between outhouses and wells, disposal of human and animal refuse in the streets and rivers, and the extent to which animals roamed through Denver city streets. It was not until a major flood in 1878 triggered an epidemic that construction of the city's sewer system began. Bancroft, who believed in the importance of pasteurized milk, operated a dairy farm in the Bancroft community, which became part of Lakewood in 1969. He wrote about climatology and how certain diseases were affected by climate, which garnered national attention. He was a founder and first president of the State Historical and National History Society of Colorado, now called History Colorado. Colorado's Mount Bancroft is named for him. Early years Bancroft was born on May 25, 1834 in Enfield, Connecticut. His mother was a member of the Oliver Wolcott family and his father was a farmer. Bancroft descended from early New England settlers, the earliest arriving in 1660 to East Windsor, Connecticut. His father's family, the Heaths and Bancrofts, were Puritans who settled in Connecticut. His mother descended from the Bissells and Walcotts from the region. Education He studied at the Westfield Academy in Massachusetts and Charlotteville Seminary in New York before studying medicine at the University at Buffalo, graduating in February 1861. Bancroft funded his education by himself by teaching school in New York and Connecticut. After the end of the war, Bancroft attended medical lectures at the University of Pennsylvania until mid-1866 when he moved to Denver. Civil War Harrisburg, Pennsylvania map, 1855 Bancroft established a medical practice in Blakely, Pennsylvania (then in Luzerne County) for seven months before he secured an early post for an army military surgeon with the Pennsylvania Volunteers in November 1861. He was a surgeon for the Union Army during the Civil War, serving as officer in charge of Harrisburg's Church Hospital. Fortress Monroe, Virginia from War diary and letters of Stephen Minot Weld, 1861-1865 Bancroft had a number of assignments from the spring of 1862, when the regiments left the camp, until the following springs when he outfitted a hospital at Fort Delaware for confederate prisoners. He became Post Surgeon for Fortress Monroe, Virginia from June 1863 to December 1865. While there Bancroft was assigned to review operations of all nearby hospitals by the Secretary of War. He treated Jefferson Davis until the Confederate President learned that he was from New England. Thereafter, he was treated by a physician who supported the southern cause. Career Paul Frenzeny and Jules Tavernier, Denver from the Highlands, 1874 =Private and public practice= He came to Colorado on June 1, 1866, and set up a medical practice in Denver. At that time, Denver had only been a city for seven years. Bancroft, considered to be \\"one of the most prominent physicians\\" in Colorado by the obituary reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, was, for several decades, the \\"default physician-in- charge\\" for the city. From 1866 to 1869, he was the Arapahoe County physician. He was a physician in the city of Denver between 1872 and 1878, during which time, the dry climate and a widespread vaccination campaign of Denver citizens significantly reduced the threat of smallpox in the 1870s. Because children were sent to school when they were ill, there was a problem with typhoid fever, whooping cough, and scarlet fever in the 1870s. Bancroft advocated fining parents who sent their sick children to school. He was one of two physicians on the staff of St. Vincent Hospital, which became Saint Joseph Hospital in 1876. From 1872 to 1876, he was the president of East Denver's Board of Education. Bancroft was one of the founders of St. Luke's Hospital and was on the staff until a few years before he died. His private practice clients included Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, Kansas Pacific and Denver Pacific Railroads, Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway, and the Wells, Fargo and Company Stage Lines. He became National Association of Railway Surgeons vice president. =Public health= In the late 1870s, he and the Denver Medical Association created the public health system for Denver, Colorado to improve the health of its citizens. Mattie Silks ran the most successful brothel in Denver from 1877 to 1897 A key public health risk was the spread of syphilis. Bancroft estimated in 1872 that due to the prevalence of prostitution, \\"probably every third man who reaches the age of twenty-five has acquired ... syphilis\\" from the brothels in the city. Bancroft, with the Denver Medical Association, advocated licensing, stipulation of allowed services, and testing and examinations of the city's prostitutes. The proposed program was to be managed by physicians and police. The city decided instead to outlaw prostitution and fine prostitutes. In 1875, the Denver Medical Association's physicians decided that management of prostitutes was a solely a police matter. Bancroft continued to advocate a licensing system, as well as making abortion an attempted murder crime. Denver, though, was not ready to relinquish its \\"sex-drugs-and-gambling lifestyle\\" from the gold rush days. In the 1870s, tuberculosis became more prevalent in the city. Bancroft noted in a March 1873 report to the city council that, of tuberculosis deaths that he reported, 75 of 79 were ill before they sought treatment in Colorado. He had also noted in the 1870s that Denver's citizens had injuries or illnesses due to livestock being driven through and penned on the city streets, sewage and other debris on the city streets, and outhouses placed too close to wells. He stated in a couple of annual reports that the contamination is a significant public health issue and could result in a typhus and tuberculosis epidemic, he cautioned the city council. Although there were earlier attempts, it was not until 1880 that Denver began construction of a sewer system. In 1876, he was elected president of the Denver Medical Association. He was a member of the American Medical Association. Bancroft was elected president of the Colorado State Medical Society in 1880. The following year he helped found the University of Denver and Colorado Seminary Medical Department. His name was linked in the 20th century with Dr. Florence R. Sabin as \\"creators of the humanitarian healthcare tradition\\" in Colorado. =State Board of Health= In 1876, he was the first president of Colorado's State Board of Health, which was then called the Territorial Board of Health. The board was created when Governor John L. Routt signed legislation into law creating the nine-member board to investigate public health issues and recommend resolutions. It had an annual budget of $500,000. The Colorado State Board of Health was established on March 22, 1877, with Frederick Bancroft as its president. It had limited responsibility, such as gathering statistics about sewage disposal and water supply. Bancroft also advocated for research into what altitudes were best suited for children's development mentally and physically. Because of their limited role in advocated public health issues, members resigned and waited until the end of their terms to leave their posts. There were no members and the board failed to exist on June 1, 1886. =Author= Bancroft wrote about climatology, specifically how certain diseases were affected by climate, which garnered national attention. He discussed the healthful benefits of recuperating in the state, which is \\"said to have been responsible for more people moving to Colorado than any other single factor.\\" =Other= Bancroft, who believed in the importance of pasteurized milk, operated an 800-acre dairy farm about 5 miles southwest of Denver in the Bancroft community, which became part of Lakewood in 1969. Lambert Dairy was located near the intersection of Morrison Road and Harlan Road. The sanitized milk that was produced at Lambert Dairy was supplied to St. Lukes Hospital, where many of his patients were victims of diphtheria and typhoid. Bancroft believed that there was a connection between their illness and the ingestion of unpasteurized milk. Some of the farm land was donated by his son, George Bancroft, for the construction of a one-room school that was named \\"Bancroft School\\". The Bancrofts also donated land in the area for Midway School. Herndon Davis made a painting of the farmhouse in 1941; it is displayed in the Western History section of the Denver Public Library. Bancroft was a founder and president of Agricultural ditch beginning in 1875. It was an important irrigation canal for the Denver region. After having played a key role in 1868 in the development of Denver's Grand Army post, Bancroft became department commander for Colorado and Wyoming. He was Denver's pension examiner. Bancroft helped to improve the Denver schools and from 1872 to 1876, he was president of East Denver schools. He assisted in the administration of Jarvis Hall, founded by his wife's father, and the Episcopalian girls' school, Wolfe Hall. Colorado Historical Society In 1879 he was co-founder and first president of the Colorado Historical Society, originally called the State Historical and National History Society of Colorado. He served as president for 17 years. Bancroft was a member of the American Historical Association and the Sons of the American Revolution. Personal life Bancroft married Mary Caroline Jarvis, daughter of George A. Jarvis of Brooklyn, New York, in 1871. In 1869, she came to Denver from Brooklyn, traveling on train and stage coach with Bishop George M. Randall and his wife, to cure her tuberculosis. (George A. Jarvis had read an article in a Connecticut paper about Bancroft's view of the curative qualities of the Colorado climate.) Her granddaughter, Caroline Bancroft, tells that her grandmother was quite ill when she exited the train in Denver and \\"fell... into the arms\\" of her future husband. For one year she lived with Bishop Randall and his wife and was then married to Frederick. Mary Caroline, an Episcopalian, was involved in important works within the Denver community and played a leadership role in the St. John in the Wilderness church efforts. She authored the book A Retrospective Sketch of the Fortnightly Club, 1881–1888. The Bancrofts had four children: Mary McLean (1872–1949), George Jarvis (1873–1945), Anna Chloe (1875–1878), and Frederick Wolcott (1880–1963). Frederick Wolcott Bancroft became a physician. Bancroft's granddaughter, Caroline Bancroft, was a journalist and author of Colorado history. The family lived on Capitol Hill on Grant Street, \\"the Avenue of Kings\\". Their street address was 1775 Grant Street. Bancroft had two working ranches and a summer home on 2,400 acres between Kittredge and Evergreen. In 1923, the buildings were donated to the Evergreen Conference Historic District. Charles Partridge Adams, who visited the ranch, made a painting in 1897 of the house and ranch for the family. Death Mary Caroline died in 1899 soon after the marriage of her son George. Frederick died in 1903. A few years after he retired, Bancroft died of heart failure in San Diego, California on January 17, 1903. His remains were buried in Denver, Colorado. The Walsenburg World said of him, \\"Dr. Bancroft was prominent In his profession and foremost as a citizen, and iad been identified with the best in the city's progress for almost forty years.\\" Mount Bancroft Mount Bancroft, a peak in Grand and Clear Creek counties, is named for him. Noted for his work in public health and the state's history, the summit was named for the doctor, at the request of his son, George Jarvis Bancroft (1873–1945). The decision by the United States Geological Survey to name the summit Mount Bancroft was made on March 7, 1906. It is located west of the town of Empire, within a group of summits including Mount Flora, Mount Eva, Parry Peak, James Peak, and Colorado Mines Peak. Below the summit is Lake Caroline, named for his granddaughter, Caroline Bancroft.

Born free in Virginia, he moved as a young man to the free state of Indiana. In 1840, he served as valet and then White House steward for US President William Henry Harrison, who was from that state. In the 1830s and 1840s DeBaptiste was an active conductor in Madison, Indiana. Located along the Ohio River across from Kentucky, a slave state, this town was a destination for refugee slaves seeking escape from slavery. DeBaptiste moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1846. While Michigan was a free state, refugee slaves often preferred to continue to Canada to get beyond the reach of United States fugitive slave laws. DeBaptiste was considered the president of the local underground railroad group. During this period, he purchased a lake steamboat for carrying fugitives across the Detroit River to Amherstburg, Ontario. Historians have estimated that DeBaptiste and close collaborator William Lambert secured passage of hundreds of slaves, of the estimated 30,000 slaves who settled in Canada.Underground Railroad, US Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center. DIANE Publishing, 1995, p168 In the late 1850s, DeBaptiste worked with nationally known abolitionists Frederick Douglass and John Brown. During the American Civil War, DeBaptiste helped recruit black soldiers from Michigan for the Union Army. After the wars he continued to work for African-American civil rights, helping gain admission of black children to Detroit public schools. Early life Richard DeBaptiste, George's close relative George DeBaptiste was born about 1815 in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Different sources identify different parents, and they differ on whether George was born free. The encyclopedia, The Underground Railroad (2015), names John Debaptist and Frances \\"Franky\\" as his parents. They were both said to have been born into slavery, but had gained freedom before their son George was born. Because his mother was free, George was born free.Snodgrass, Mary Ellen. The Underground Railroad: An Encyclopedia of People, Places, and Operations. Routledge, 2015. p154 Betty DeRamus names George DeBaptiste and Maria as the boy's parents. She said that George legally owned Maria and their son, but set them free on March 12, 1823.DeRamus, Betty. Forbidden Fruit: Love Stories from the Underground Railroad. Simon and Schuster, 2005. p11 William J. Simmons and Henry McNeal Turner, writing in 1887, identified the young George DeBaptiste as brother to Richard DeBaptiste, who became a noted minister in Chicago, and as son of William and Eliza DeBaptiste.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887. pp352-357 George learned the barbering trade in Richmond, Virginia. In his mid-teens he married Marie Lucinda Lee, a slave, and purchased her freedom with his earnings as a free black. On January 22, 1835, DeBaptiste obtained a free movement pass for the state of Virginia in the office of Hustings in Richmond, Virginia. It described him as, \\"a mulatto boy, about five feet seven and a half inches high, and about twenty years of age, who was born free.\\" He later said he used the certificate 33 times to help slaves escape.Mull, Carol E. The Underground Railroad in Michigan, McFarland, 2015. p60 Move to Madison, Indiana As a young man, DeBaptiste moved with his wife to Madison in the free state of Indiana. Around 1836 he invested in businesses. He also began to harbor black fugitive slaves as a conductor in the Underground Railroad. Located along the Ohio River, Madison became a destination for slaves escaping to freedom from Kentucky. It is located nearly halfway between the larger cities of Cincinnati, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, both of which are river cities. DeBaptiste's network of supporters included Dr. Samuel Tibbers in Madison and William Beard, a Quaker, in Salem, Indiana in Washington County. Catherine White Coffin and Levi Coffin were the superintendents of the ring and arranged relays of slaves to Canada. In February 1840, DeBaptiste, abolitionist Seymour Finney from New York, and William Lambert arranged the noted rescue of Robert Cromwell from a Detroit courthouse, where he was being tried under fugitive slave law after being recaptured by his master. In 1851 an African-American barber named Robert Cromwell had set up a shop in Chatham, Ontario.\\"Resisting Slavery/Robert J. Cromwell\\", L2150, Flint, Michigan; Michigan Historical Markers, 2015 =Valet to William Henry Harrison= Death of Harrison, April 4, 1841 Before his election to US President, William Henry Harrison was living in North Bend, Ohio.Calarco, Tom. People of the Underground Railroad: A Biographical Dictionary. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008. p253-255 DeBaptiste became his valet during his campaign and, after Harrison was elected president, he appointed the young man as White House steward.Lause, Mark A. A Secret Society History of the Civil War. University of Illinois Press, 2011. p71Hudson, J. Blaine. Fugitive Slaves and the Underground Railroad in the Kentucky Borderland. McFarland, 2002. p117-118 Harrison's term was the shortest of any presidency, as he died of illness after one month in office. DeBaptiste had become very close with the president and cared for him during his illness. An obituary of DeBaptiste said that at Harrison's death, DeBaptiste was at his side and held the president in his arms at his last breath.Tobin, Jacqueline L. From Midnight to Dawn: The Last Tracks of the Underground Railroad. Anchor, 2008. p200-209 After Harrison's death, DeBaptiste returned to Madison. His barbershop became \\"the nerve center\\" of the Madison, Indiana underground railroad. =Fugitives along the Ohio River= DeBaptiste was still living in Madison in 1843, when he conducted Adam and Sarah Crosswhite and their four children to freedom. (A few years later he aided them in Detroit, when they crossed the Detroit River into Canada in 1847).Frost, Karolyn Smardz. A Fluid Frontier: Slavery, Resistance, and the Underground Railroad in the Detroit River Borderland. Wayne State University Press, 2016. About this time, DeBaptiste, Lambert, and Coffin began working with George J. Reynolds. In 1846, DeBaptiste was still working along the Ohio River, ferrying Kentucky runaways across to Ohio and Indiana, and then to Michigan and Ontario, Canada. He frequently loaned his freedom papers to other men of similar height and build. Slavery supporters in the area demanded his arrest for his failure to pay a $500 bond required by the state from free blacks until Judge Stephen C. Stevens declared that law unconstitutional. Repeatedly attacked in Madison for his anti-slavery work, as southern Ohio had slavery supporters, DeBaptist was forced to leave town. Move to Detroit, Michigan At age 34, in 1846, DeBaptiste moved to Detroit where he continued to work as a barber and also sold clothes at Robert Banks' store. His former comrade William Lambert had also moved to Detroit, and the two men began to work closely together. They were both members of The Order of Men of Oppression and the Order of Emancipation, groups which fought slavery and raised money to aid fugitives. In Detroit, DeBaptiste was considered to be the \\"president\\" of the Detroit Underground Railroad, William Lambert the \\"vice president\\" or \\"secretary\\", and Laura Haviland the \\"superintendent\\". Henry Bibb was another important figure in the group.Toledo, Gregory. The Hanging of Old Brown: A Story of Slaves, Statesmen, and Redemption. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. p75 George's relative and possibly brother, Richard DeBaptiste, moved to Detroit from Virginia in 1846 and worked with George there, and in the 1850s in Ohio.Calarco, Tom, and Cynthia Vogel. Places of the Underground Railroad: A Geographical Guide. ABC-CLIO, 2011. p55 In 1848, DeBaptiste took work as steward on the steamship Arrow, which traveled on the Great Lakes between Sandusky, Ohio and Detroit. In 1859 together with William Whipper,Simmons 1887, p862-863 DeBaptiste purchased a lake steamship, the T. Whitney. He could not hold a captain's license, so he hired a white captain named Atwood. The boat ran a similar route to the Arrow. It regularly stopped at Amherstburg, Ontario, Canada to load up on lumber and, presumably, to offload fugitives. Samuel C. Watson worked on the boat as a clerk and part manager. DeBaptiste's activism extended beyond his work as a conductor. He was an occasional correspondent to various anti-slavery journals, including the North Star and the Liberator. He also played a role in the larger national abolitionism movement. On March 12, 1859, John Brown, Frederick Douglass, William Lambert, and DeBaptiste met at William Webb's house to discuss emancipation. DeBaptiste proposed that conspirators blow up some of the South's largest churches. The suggestion was opposed by Brown, who felt humanity precluded such unnecessary bloodshed. Before emancipation, the state of Kentucky had posted a reward of $1,000 to capture DeBaptiste. Portrait of John Brown in 1859 by Ole Peter Hansen Balling, painted in 1872 Senator James Murray Mason was the head of the investigating committee against John Brown. After Brown's insurrection, capture, and hanging, Mason attempted to subpoena a \\"John DeBaptiste\\", later changed to \\"George DeBaptiste\\" in records (probably the subject of this article.) Tasked with serving the warrant, the sheriff of Detroit wrote to the committee: \\"Knowing the caste and character of DeBaptiste my first impression on receiving the summons was that if Senator Mason knew the facts he would not desire the summons to be served, even if I should find DeBaptiste here... If DeBaptiste were summoned, there is not probability that he would obey...\\" and the summons was never served. Civil war and after During the American Civil War, DeBaptiste worked with Detroit civil rights activist John D. Richards in recruiting Michigan's first black regiment. He also served as a sutler. After the war, in the late 1860s, DeBaptiste worked with the Freedmen's Bureau. He also opened a catering business in Detroit.Advertisement, Detroit Free Press (Detroit, Michigan), July 11, 1872, p. 2, accessed October 3, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6877462/advertisement_detroit_free_press/ He won first prize for his wedding cakes in the 1873 Michigan State Fair. Continuing to work on civil rights for African Americans, he advocated for the right of black students to attend Detroit Public Schools. He was a member of Second Baptist Church in Detroit. In 1870, he was the first black to be elected delegate to the state Republican nominating convention.Katz, William Loren. Black Pioneers: An Untold Story.

Its purpose is to prevent accidental falls inside the window well and to prevent buildup of water, snow, and debris in the window well which could lead to basement flooding.  Materials  Window well covers are available in different materials: * Plastic material, mainly Polyethylene and Polycarbonate (a thermoplastic) * Metal material, mainly aluminium and steel. When a window well cover is made out of this material, it is commonly referred to as a window well grate. Polycarbonate window well covers provide added durability over their polyethylene counterparts. Covers made from polycarbonate are more than 200 times stronger than covers made from polyethylene and can withstand temperature changes with less expansion. Window well covers made from metal typically only allow air- flow and protection from large objects entering the window well such as people, large falling debris, and large pets. These style of covers can be combined with a clear plastic top cover made of Polycarbonate or Polyethylene to provide protection from water, snow, and smaller debris.  Home inspection requirements  Regarding window well cover strength and operation, the International Code Council (ICC) 2007 edition, Section 3.4, states that window well covers shall support \\"a minimum live load of 40 pounds per square foot. The cover shall be operable from within the window well without the use of tools or special knowledge, and shall require no more than 30 pounds of force to fully open.\\" Depending on the type of basement window, and if the basement window extends above the well, a window well cover may be required to allow enough clearance for the basement window to open properly in case of emergency egress. Casement, hopper, and awning style basement windows require extra room in order to function properly.  Liability  There have been historical instances where unprotected window wells have been the center of lawsuits against homeowners and landlords. In the case of MULL v. KERSTETTER 373 Pa.Super. 228 (1988), a volunteer firefighter was injured after falling into an unprotected window well, the court ruled that a police officer entering land in his or her official capacity, and in response to a call for assistance, is viewed as a “licensee”, and is therefore owed the same duty of care that any citizen who is permitted to be on the property would receive.

The 45-episode television series centers around a conflict between humans and Bugsters, a form of computer virus that infects humans playing Genm Corp video games. Once a Bugster fully manifests, the human host's personality fades away. Genm Corp and the Ministry of Health counter the Bugster threat by developing Gamer Driver belts and a series of transformation- and summon-type trinkets, the Rider Gashats, for doctors to save their patients from the Bugster viruses. Characters include a number of doctors and other health-care workers, corporate employees, and Bugsters. Some of these characters also appear in the films Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid & Ghost with Legend Rider, Kamen Rider × Super Sentai: Ultra Super Hero Taisen, Kamen Rider Ex-Aid the Movie: True Ending and Kamen Rider Heisei Generations Final: Build & Ex-Aid with Legend Rider, various web series, and a video game of the Kamen Rider:Climax series. Seito University Hospital is a prestigious medical facility. The (abbreviated CR) is secretly located in the basement of the hospital. It operates under the authority of the and is used for isolating and rescuing Bugster Virus victims. It was founded five years before the present storyline during , before the Bugster infection was made public. =Emu Hojo= , also known by his gaming tag of \\"M\\", is a 24-year-old pediatrics intern who later becomes a surgical intern and master gamer. He was inspired to become a doctor after receiving a special life-saving surgery from Kyotaro Hinata as a child. Kyotaro also gave Emu a WonderSwan handheld console as a present which ignited his interest in gaming. He is friendly and well-meaning but also clumsy and somewhat absentminded, which often gets him into trouble with the nurses. As the series progress, however, Emu matures and becomes less naive, even picking up some of Kiriya's habits of lying and showing himself to be just as good a manipulator as Kuroto and Masamune. His gaming skills earn him a and a cartridge-like so that he can fight the Bugsters. 16 years prior to the series, Emu was an antisocial child who found solace in designing game characters. After sending his concepts to Genm Corp game designer Kuroto Dan, Emu received a prototype game which infected him as patient zero of the Bugster Virus and created another persona named Parad, manifested from his desire to have a playmate. Parad's dominance in Emu's body helped the boy rise to fame as until he was abducted by Next Genome scientists to extract the Bugster Viruses for Kuroto. Parad emerged from the operation as a Bugster; their separation allowed Emu to regain his inspiration as a doctor and earn an internship at Seito University Hospital. Remnants of Parad in his body allow Emu to retain his gamer persona and the resistance needed to use the Gamer Driver while creating Gashats from his imagination. Emu experienced a near- fatal outburst when his true nature was revealed by Kuroto; Parad intervened by possessing Emu until Hiiro returned him to his senses. At the height of the Kamen Rider Chronicle crisis, Emu regained Poppy as an ally following her brainwashing. Parad then possessed Emu and forced him to fight against his own Bugster to the point of exhaustion, until Poppy revived Kuroto and used his Level 0 form's power to negate the Bugster's possession, preventing Parad from possessing Emu again. Kuroto's father, Masamune, returned as CEO of Genm Corp. and revealed that he'd been using Kuroto and Emu as pawns, and that he is also a patient zero. Using the platform game-based Gashat allows Emu to become . His chibi-like first form, , can utilize agile attacks. Pulling the Gamer Driver's lever upgrades Ex-Aid to his sleeker primary form, . His multi-form in these and other recent forms is the , which has two modes: Hammer and Blade. When activating Mighty Action X, a digital field-like is generated which creates several medal-like with unique power-ups in random chocolate block-like containers. *: A beat 'em up-based Gashat that summons the mecha- like support robot. By inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver alongside Mighty Action X before pulling its lever, Ex-Aid combines with the Robot Gama to assume where he is equipped with the gauntlet-like on his left arm for enhanced punching. He can also launch the Gekitotsu Smasher as a rocket fist for long range combat. *: A monster-hunting game-based Gashat that summons the dragon-like support robot. By inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver alongside Mighty Action X before pulling its lever, Ex-Aid combines with the Hunter Gama to assume where he is equipped with the headgear-like for either biting or breathing streams of fire. He can also extend the Dragon Fang's tail as a whip. Ex-Aid can transform into , which combines the abilities and weapons of his and the other Riders' Level 5 forms. However, due to Drago Knight Hunter Z's nature as a multiplayer game, using its Gashat to assume this full-armored form causes Ex-Aid to malfunction and Emu's body to be taken over, resulting in him attacking enemies and allies alike. Seeing how teamwork cooperation is important, he tricks Brave, Snipe and Lazer into fighting against him in their Level 3 forms, allowing the Gashat's power to be equally distributed among them upon his and Hunter Gama's defeat. *: A sports game- based Gashat that summons the bicycle-like for Ex-Aid to ride upon. By inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver alongside Mighty Action X before pulling its lever, Ex-Aid combines with the Sports Gama to assume equipped with the disc-like on his shoulders for projectile throwing. This Gashat originally belonged to Genm until Ex-Aid defeated him with Hunter Action Gamer Level 5 (Dragon Fang) and claimed it for himself. *: A cooking game-based Gashat that summons the food-like support robot. By inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver alongside Mighty Action X before pulling its lever, Ex-Aid combines with the Burger Gama to assume where he is equipped with both the roller-skate-like for increased speed and the dual condiment bottle-like and on his arms for shooting energy blasts of ketchup and mustard. Para-DX steals this Gashat and gives it to Kuroto after defeating Ex-Aid. *: A hack-and- slash-based Gashat that originally belonged to Lazer before Genm killed him and stole it. Ex-Aid later claims it after Genm is defeated by Ex-Aid Maximum Gamer Level 99, Snipe Simulation Gamer Level 50 and Brave Hunter Quest Level 5 (Full Dragon). After Kiriya's death, Emu receives both his Gamer Driver and the racing game-based Gashat as mementos. By inserting this Gashat into the strap-like on his Gamer Driver's left waist, Ex-Aid can summon the motorcycle- like for him to ride upon. He is also able to perform its finisher. Following the destruction of his Gamer Driver by Genm, Emu uses Kiriya's Gamer Driver as a backup belt until it is stolen by Hiiro, under duress from Masamune Dan who used it to revive Kiriya as Lazer Turbo. Soon after, Kuroto repairs Emu's original Gamer Driver to functionality. Emu later acquires the Gashat, a co-op version of Mighty Action X whose concept he created during his childhood. Inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver and then pulling its lever transforms Ex-Aid into the chibi-like . By closing and pulling the Gamer Driver's lever a second time, he upgrades to the sleeker where he splits into two Level X forms: Double Action Gamer Level XX L, an azure-colored left half with Emu's level-headed doctor personality who prioritizes his patient's safety, and Double Action Gamer Level XX R, an orange-colored right half with M's (later Parad) hot-blooded gamer personality who prioritizes defeating his opponent to ensure victory. In these forms, Ex-Aid's health bar-like is tripled. However, if two of his Level X form's Rider Gauges are empty, he will be unable to assume his Level XX form. His Gashacon Weapon in these and other recent forms is the , which has three modes: Blade, Axe, and Gun. During battle, the Level XX halves either pass the Gashacon Key Slasher between each other or each wield it and the Gashacon Breaker. Unlike most Gashacon Weapons which can hold a single Gashat for any rider to perform its finisher, the Gashacon Key Slasher can hold either two Gashats or one dual-based Gashat. Inserting Mighty Brothers XX into the Gashacon Key Slasher allows one Level XX half to manifest a temporary duplicate of the Gashacon Weapon for the other half to wield. If the Level XX halves simultaneously close and pull their Gamer Driver's lever, Ex-Aid can perform his Critical Strike. At first, using this Gashat's power had the side effect of Emu suffering an extreme headache followed by a temporary loss of consciousness upon deactivation. However, once he learns of his current status as a progenitor to the Bugster Virus, he no longer has this problem. This Gashat first appears in Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid & Ghost with Legend Rider, though it was a temporary fusion of the Mighty Action X and Proto Mighty Action X Gashats. In the series, Emu recreates the Mighty Brothers XX Gashat after receiving a blank Gashat and inserting it into the Gamer Driver to make contact with his immune system. Using money obtained from Taiga for development, Tsukuru creates a new blank Gashat infused with the Bugster Virus samples from Kiriya's research given directly from Yoshitaka to Hiiro then Taiga. However, only someone with a natural antibody-like Ex-Aid could complete its creation. Like Mighty Brothers XX, Emu imprints the blank Gashat with his DNA to create the mecha simulation game-based Gashat. Inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver and then pulling its lever simultaneously transforms Ex-Aid into his Level 2 form and summons the armored suit-like , which resembles his Level 1 form. Pressing its top button afterwards combines Ex-Aid with the Maximum Gama to assume where he gains the ability to rewrite a Bugster's coding, allowing him to render a Rider's compatible surgery powerless and heal any victims of Game Disease, thus making him the ultimate cure for the Bugster infection. He can also fly, extend his limbs and eject himself from the Maximum Gama, which has an autopilot to assist Ex-Aid during combat. By closing and pulling the Gamer Driver's lever a second time, Ex-Aid can perform his finisher. *: A cheat cartridge-based Gashat that when attached to Maximum Mighty X evolves Maximum Gamer Level 99 into Ex-Aid's ultimate form, , where he gains warping capabilities and is immune to negative status effects, such as Cronus' Pause ability. By pressing this Gashat's top button twice in succession, Ex-Aid can perform his finisher. If this Gashat is placed into the Gamer Driver's secondary slot and its lever is pulled, it activates a which grants the Rider using it 10 seconds of invincibility. At first, Emu was unable to use this Gashat due to losing his gamer persona after being \\"separated\\" from Parad. However, he manages to reawaken his gamer persona by luring Parad into the Gashacon Bugvisor II and uses it to inject the aforementioned Bugster into himself, enabling him to bring out Hyper Muteki's full potential. After Hyper Muteki is erased from existence by Cronus' Reset ability, Emu helps Kuroto create a second Gashat which includes a function to ensure that Ex-Aid and his allies won't be affected by the effects of Reset anymore. After Gamedeus is released from Kamen Rider Chronicle and its Game Disease is spread, Kuroto creates the Gashat, a medical-based antivirus version of Mighty Brothers XX, as a means of counteracting the epidemic by using samples of its virus from his and Kiriya's Bugster bodies; Kiriya delivers it to Ex-Aid after he turns Kuroto over to the authorities. To defeat Gamedues and reverse its Game Disease, Ex-Aid inserts Doctor Mighty XX into the Gashacon Key Slasher to perform its Critical Finish. Poppy later uses this Gashat to sacrifice her physical body and cure Gamedeus Cronus' Bugster-zombified victims before Para- DX uses it himself to destroy Gamedeus at the cost of his own life. It is unknown if this Gashat was restored after Emu revived Parad. In other Kamen Rider Ex-Aid media, Ex-Aid has access to other Gamer forms that do not appear in the canon of the TV series. These include: *: A Legend Rider Gashat based on Kamen Rider Ghost that allows Ex-Aid to transform into the chibi-like , as well as upgrade to the sleeker by pulling the Gamer Driver's lever. In these forms, he is armed with the Gan Gun Saber. Ex-Aid's Critical Strike in his Level 2 form is a variation of the Ore Omega Drive (Ghost's Rider Kick). These forms are exclusive to both Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid & Ghost with Legend Rider and Kamen Rider Genm: Legend Rider Stage. *: A Legend Rider Gashat based on Kamen Rider Drive that allows Ex-Aid to transform into the chibi-like , as well as upgrade to the sleeker by pulling the Gamer Driver's lever.

This form is exclusive to the Kamen Rider Lazer Hyper Battle DVD. *: A sequel-based Gashat of Knock Out Fighter that allows Ex-Aid and Para-DX to simultaneously transform into . By closing and pulling their Gamer Driver's lever a second time, Ex-Aid and Para-DX can perform their finisher together. These forms are exclusive to the Kamen Rider Para-DX Hyper Battle DVD. *: A virtual reality-based Gashat that transforms Ex-Aid into where he creates weapons to attack enemies, such as swords and missiles, via the power of virtual reality. This form is exclusive to Kamen Rider Ex-Aid the Movie: True Ending. *: A Legend Rider Gashat based on Kamen Rider Build. During Kamen Rider × Super Sentai: Ultra Super Hero Taisen, Emu temporarily assumes the form of the red-colored , a hybrid of Akarenger and the Double Riders, once he and his team prevail in the Game World's Ultra Super Hero Taisen tournament. In this form he rides the Gorengers' original airship, the Variblune, against the Xevious fleet. Emu Hojo is portrayed by . As a child, Emu is portrayed by . =Poppy Pipopapo/Asuna Karino= is sent from the Ministry of Health to CR as a nurse, acting as the Kamen Riders' navigator and guide. \\"Asuna\\" is a guise for her true identity as a Bugster named , based on a video game character from the rhythm game DoReMiFa Beat. Although she reveals her true nature (in \\"Christmas Special\\"), Emu and Hiiro are already aware of this, with the latter concluding that her civilian name is an anagram for the Japanese word of . Like the Bugster executives, Poppy is capable of entering any level selected by the Kamen Riders, of teleportation, and she once influenced Bugster Viruses into her rhythm dance. While the cost for her powers are yet to be revealed she is able to turn a pair of dining cutlery into energy weapons and utilize the power of the Energy Items. She was born from the Bugster infection of Kuroto's mother, , whose life was unintentionally sacrificed in the process due to having an unknown regular illness, thus making Poppy a complete Bugster yet emotionally scarred; Kuroto, even his father Masamune regrets being unable to save her. Sakurako helped her son during his youth at Genm Corp on the Bugster development. Her data was revealed to be sealed inside a Proto Gashat; Sakurako's illness is the reason Kuroto, as well secretly Masamune wants to develop Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashats, in order to cure her regular illness once a player manages to beat Kamen Rider Chronicle's final stage. After Kuroto's first death, while the Riders are on duty, Poppy comes under the thrall of the Lovrica Bugster and helps Parad complete the Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashat. She then serves as the game's referee & navigator and deals disciplinary action against anyone, including a doctor, who breaks the rules of the game. When Lovrica is defeated, she begins to regain her memories before Emu frees her from the Bugster's brainwashing. However, Poppy considers herself beyond redemption and subjects herself to being hunted by Kamen Rider and Ride-Player alike until Emu reminds her of the good person she has become. Indebted to Emu, memories of Poppy's host Sakurako lead her to a Gamer Driver and the Proto Mighty Action X Origin Gashat which was said to be a failsafe system against the Bugster infection, thus reviving Kuroto as a Bugster. During Masamune's last scheme to initiate a full-scale second Zero Day's Game Disease infection as Gamedeus Cronus, Poppy sacrifices herself by merging her own data with the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat to perfect it and destroy Gamedeus. However, one fragment of Poppy's data was used by Kuroto to restore her. While Poppy is in her brainwashed state, Ren Amagasaki gives her a and an upgraded version of the Gashacon Bugvisor known as the which she combines into the for her to transform into .

Genm Corp. was founded by Masamune's son, Kuroto, who was involved in the discovery of the Bugster Virus and the special surgery on Emu Hojo. After Emu's surgery, Kuroto planned to compromise Genm Corp. by observing Emu for 10 years when he contact Next Genome to breed the matured Bugsters from Emu's body, then used some of remaining Bugster Viruses out of Emu's body to unleash the first Zero Day in 2011; he framed his father for this, and was thus able to take over the company. After Kuroto, known as Kamen Rider Genm, is revealed to be the mastermind behind the Zero Day outbreak, Genm Corp. has a financial crisis until the new mysterious CEO Ren Amagasaki arrives to revive the company with the in-house developer Tsukuru. The company was temporarily comprised by Kuroto's return, until Ex-Aid Maximum Gamer Level 99 rendered Kuroto powerless from being a Rider anymore, though his former ally Parad and the Bugsters took control of the company. Masamune, revealed to have been overseeing Gemn Corp's agenda from prison, retakes his position as CEO until his death, when Tsukuru Koboshi takes over. =Kuroto Dan= is the 30-year-old CEO of Genm Corp. and son of the company's previous CEO Masamune, a calm and polite person who is actually a cold-blooded and manipulative narcissist who believes his intelligence is something to be feared. As a teenager he created games for his father, developing a grudge against a young Emu who sent in brilliant ideas for games which challenged Kuroto's belief that only he was capable of making great games. He was among the first people to learn of the Bugster Virus in 2000, having infected Emu to study for a decade before extracting most of the virus to orchestrate Zero Day with prototypes of the Rider Gashats known as .But Kuroto lost his sanity when his mother, who helped him in a Bugster development project where he hid a Gamer Driver and the Proto Mighty Action X Origin Gashat as a failsafe, succumbed to an accidental Bugster infection. This influenced Kuroto to cause the Zero Day epidemic of 2010, framing his father to take over the company while unaware that he was being manipulated by his father. While Kuroto developed CR and the Kamen Rider systems for the Ministry of Health to combat the Bugsters, he allied himself with the monsters while interfering with the Riders' battles as . His goal was to use the Gashats' completed data to create a Gashat containing \\"The Ultimate Game\\": a global augmented reality massively multiplayer online game death battle called . While claiming himself as Kamen Rider Chronicle's \\"Game Master\\", Kuroto's actual goal later revealed is to resurrect his mother. He helps the Riders only when it comes to threats to his agenda, such as when he helped Kamen Riders Specter and Necrom against the Great Eyeser's Gammas in the finale of Kamen Rider Ghost. In the Heisei Generations movie, Kuroto allowed the Next Genome Institute to take over Genm Corp. while he secretly recorded their battle data to create a \\"forbidden game\\"; this allows him to summon digitized versions of Kamen Riders Wizard, Gaim and Drive via the Ganbarizing Gashat. This continued in Tricks where he creates the Legend Rider Gashats to gather data in order to upgrade his Ganbarizing Gashat and summons digitized versions of Kamen Riders Double, OOO, and Fourze. However, a new Dr. Pac-Man (later secretly revealed to be Parad in disguise) emerges and rescues Emu while assisting the other two doctor Riders against Genm and his summoned Riders. It is then revealed that Kuroto contacted Next Genome to use Emu's body on Zero Day and framed his father Masamune once Emu's condition went into a coma-state after his exhaustion from winning the Tekken tournament in 2010. As Genm, Kuroto forces Ex-Aid to complete the Shakariki Sports Gashat's data by targeting Poppy and one of Emu's patients. With ten of the Gashats' data cleared, it allowed Kuroto to survive Ex-Aid's attack by transferring the data of his \\"death\\" into the Dangerous Zombie Gashat.

Kuroto is later exposed for murdering Kiriya, as an attempt to conceal his identity, and becomes a fugitive while continuing to relieve the Kamen Riders of their Gashats. When the Ministry of Health finds his hideout, Kuroto infects himself with the Charlie Bugster and tricked Emu to evade arrest, obtaining the refined Shakariki Sports Gashat while corroding Emu's Gamer Driver beyond use. However, Emu uses Kiriya's Gamer Driver in combination with the Maximum Mighty X Gashat and reprograms Genm's data to render his Zombie Gamer form vulnerable to defeat by the Kamen Riders. After the fight, Kuroto is killed by Parad who takes his Gashacon Bugvisor and Dangerous Zombie Gashat. In Kamen Sentai Gorider it is revealed that Kuroto had a backup plan by inserting himself into an unbeatable game. He disguised himself as Kazuma Kenzaki in order to fool Emu and four revived Riders (Another Agito, Baron, Marika, and Lazer) into entering an impossible game for one sole purpose: gathering the despair of dead Kamen Riders to power his own resurrection. Kuroto's plan was foiled by the appearance of the real Kenzaki, who was attracted by the undead powers, and who destroyed the Game World. Kuroto is able to transform into Genm and gets upgraded by Totema via the gathered despair, only to be beaten by Ex-Aid and the Goriders. His anger leads him to create a space warp in an attempt to destroy Ex-Aid and Blade, but he is stopped by the revived Riders who sacrifice themselves to allow Emu and Kenzaki to escape. Poppy, as the Bugster created from Kuroto's mother, used her former host's memories to revive Kuroto, albeit as a Bugster with 100 extra lives while christening himself , as he joins forces with the Doctor Riders initially to exact revenge on Parad while Poppy managed to help him regain a sense of humanity with achieving the revival of the Bugsters' deceased hosts, including Kiriya Kujo. When Masamune resumes as Gemn Corp's CEO, Kuroto realizes his father manipulated and wished to have realized it sooner so he could had killed him rather than framing him. After Masamune manipulates Hiiro into betraying Kuroto, Kuroto creates the Hyper Muteki Gashat in order to transform into Muteki Gamer as a countermeasure against Cronus and his unwitting pawns.

However, the Gashat's creation had been Kiriya's master plan from the start, reversing Gamedeus' virus into a vaccine in his body. Once the Gashat is finished, Kiriya apprehended Kuroto into the Gashacon Bugvisor II and handed him over to the authorities. While imprisoned yet advising the CR, Kuroto changed his name to to reflect his god complex. ( is a Sino-Japanese reading of the kanji . He later returned to CR, learning that Doctor Mighty XX's power wasn't enough to negate Gamedeus Cronus' infection of each victim. During an escape from the Bugster zombified victims, Kuroto is rescued by Kamen Rider Build, who mistakes him for Ex-Aid like the Riders from Kamen Rider Ghost. Though Poppy sacrificed her physical body by merging her data into the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat to stop the Gamedeus epidemic, Kuroto acquires a fragment of the Bugster's data at the time and later uses it to recreate Poppy in his cell. In Another Ending, Kuroto returns to a life of crime and attempts to initiate a universal apocalypse through a multiplayer survival horror-based game called . He was ultimately defeated by Kiriya Kujo while on his last life, regaining his sanity and morality while disappearing permanently, though his spirit later appears a fully restored Kiriya for a brief moment while giving him a friendly smirk. Using the beta-test Gashat allows Kuroto to become Kamen Rider Genm, a dark version of Ex-Aid who is stronger than him due to using a Proto Gashat which has unlimited powers, but also a side effect of harming the user's body from prolonged use. His chibi- like first form, , can utilize agile attacks. Pulling the Gamer Driver's lever upgrades Genm to his sleeker primary form, . His Gashacon Weapon in these and other recent forms is the , which has three modes: Pad, Beam Gun, and Chainsaw. The Gashacon Bugvisor can absorb a defeated Bugster's data and trap them within it.

To use it, he combines the Gashacon Bugvisor with the to create the . Inserting this Gashat into the Buggle Driver and then pressing the small red button next to its slot transforms Genm into . When activating Dangerous Zombie, Kuroto can summon zombie-themed Bugster Viruses. If a Rider inserts this Gashat into their Gamer Driver, it will inflict damage to them by depleting their Rider Gauge to 10%. Genm can remove the Gashacon Bugvisor from his Bugster Buckle while Dangerous Zombie is still intact to absorb the virus essences of a defeated Bugster. As this Gashat's power is based on fictional zombies, Genm is capable of regenerating from any injuries he may receive. His Rider Gauge also remains empty, allowing him to circumvent death from its side effect – until it is refilled by Ex-Aid Maximum Gamer Level 99 to remove his immortality. By simultaneously pressing the A and B buttons on the Buggle Driver followed by pressing one of them a second time, Genm can perform one of two finishers: via the A button or via the B button. Level X's power is designated as \\"unknown\\", implied to be either more powerful than any other levels or the lowest.

In desperation to save Emu from Parad, Poppy revives Kuroto by using a spare Gamer Driver and a special version of the Proto Mighty Action X Gashat known as on a Bugster Virus with his data which grants him9 lives and the ability to produce a clone of himself whenever he receives a Game Over. This Gashat allows Genm to transform into where he is capable of both nullifying the effects of a Bugster Virus and weakening the higher levels of a Rider. His Gashacon Weapons in this form are the Gashacon Bugvisor II, in place of the original version, and the Gashacon Breaker. *After regaining his Dangerous Zombie Gashat from Para-DX, Genm can assume , a form similar to the Buggle Driver-based Zombie Gamer Level X, by inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver alongside Proto Mighty Action X Origin before pulling its lever. Due to the Proto Mighty Action X Origin Gashat's abilities, it negates the Dangerous Zombie Gashat's side effects on the Gamer Driver which makes this form even more powerful than Zombie Gamer Level X when Genm first used Dangerous Zombie with the Buggle Driver. In other Kamen Rider Ex-Aid media, Genm has access to other Gamer forms that do not appear in the canon of the TV series. These include: *: A Legend Rider Gashat based on Kamen Rider Wizard that allows Genm to transform into the chibi-like , as well as upgrade to the sleeker by pulling the Gamer Driver's lever. However, due to his primary form using a Proto Gashat, the levels of Genm's Legend Rider forms are each unique: Wizard Gamer Level 1 remains the same as Action Gamer Level 1, except Genm wears a mask of Wizard's face, while Wizard Gamer Level 2 retains some of the bodysuit parts from Action Gamer Level 2, except Genm's helmet and chest armor resemble Wizard's.

This form is exclusive to the Kamen Rider Lazer Hyper Battle DVD. After returning to his villainous way in Another Ending, Kuroto creates the mecha simulation game-based Gashat. Inserting this Gashat into the Gamer Driver and then pulling its lever transforms Genm into his Level 0 form and summons the armored suit-like , which resembles his Level 1 form. Pressing its top button afterwards combines Genm with the God Maximum Gama to assume where he gains godlike abilities such as controlling planets or the sun. By closing and pulling the Gamer Driver's lever a second time, Genm can perform his finisher. Kuroto Dan is portrayed by , who is a licensed pharmacist. As a teenager, Kuroto is portrayed by . Iwanaga's portrayal of Kuroto throughout the series, especially after his character's descent to insanity and eventual revival as a comical maniac, proved highly popular among audiences. =Masamune Dan= is the 55-year-old original CEO of Genm Corp and the father of Kuroto Dan, ultimately revealed to have orchestrated his son's schemes as he wanted to revived Sakurako after she succumbed to her Bugster infection. He and his son had volunteered on Kyotaro Hinata's past surgery on Emu. By the start of the series, having secretly made himself a patient zero of the Bugster Virus and developing a god complex, Masamune was imprisoned after allowing his son to use him as a scapegoat for the Zero Day incident in 2010 so his virus can be properly incubated. During that time, Masamune is visited by Kiriya Kujo whom he revealed the nature of Emu's medical history in Kyotaro's surgery and Next Genome in relation to Zero Day, and then by Emu whom he revealed how Kuroto learned of the Bugster virus. Once released after being cleared of all charges, his son and the other Riders and Bugsters having fulfilled their roles in completing Kamen Rider Chronicle, Masamune reclaims his position as CEO of Genm Corp and commercially releases the game. His master plan is to mass-produce Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashats and release them worldwide, with many of the players killed and turned into data. Masamune had dealings with Machina Visions until its CEO, Johnny Maxima, abandoned work on Kamen Rider Chronicle to develop virtual reality (VR). Masamune also had Gamedeus reprogrammed to do his bidding behind Kuroto's back. When the CR developed a means to defeat Gamedeus and end Kamen Rider Chronicle, Masamune absorbs the Bugster and transforms into . He then fortified the Gamedeus virus to cause a citywide epidemic until Poppy sacrifices herself to enhance the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat for Parad to use in extracting Gamedeus from Masamune, allowing them to be destroyed. Though Masamune lost Gamedeus, he takes out his revenge on the Kamen Riders until Emu breaks free from a time freeze and damages Masamune's Bugvisor. Defeated, Masamune eagerly commits suicide by subjecting himself to his Gashat's virus, taking the Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashat with him to prevent the Riders from freeing the Game Disease victims from the Proto Gashats. In Another Ending, Masamune was revealed to have been revived by Kuroto while forced to develop Zombie Chronicle and serve as a host incubator for the Bugster Virus which Another Parad was created from. As Kuroto succeeds in creating God Maximum Mighty X, Masamune managed to free himself and is fatally wounded in an attempt to atone for his actions and his son's. Found by Kiriya, Masamune reveals the truth of what drove him and his son to madness while giving the doctor his Buggle Driver II. Masamune uses the Buggle Driver II and a master copy of the Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashat to transform into . His primary form, , possesses an ability known as that allows him to manipulate time by simultaneously pressing the A and B buttons on the Buggle Driver II. According to Kuroto, Cronus' Pause ability is the only way to defeat Gamedeus. According to Lovrica, humans with a compatibility surgery would lose their lives should they attempt to use the Buggle Driver II as only humans infused with the original Bugster Virus via injection, or from being infected, can properly use it. By pressing the A and B buttons on the Gashacon Bugvisor II in a specific order, Cronus can perform one of two finishers: via Beam Gun Mode after pressing B and then A or via Chainsaw Mode after pressing A and then B. Like Poppy, he can also perform the Critical Crews-Aid by pressing the B button on the Buggle Driver II twice in succession. Since he possesses the master Gashat of Kamen Rider Chronicle, Masamune can either manipulate or erase the lives of Bugsters to control the casualties of Ride- Players and ensure its popularity. By utilizing the power of the Bugster virus within him at maximum, Masamune can activate a secondary ability of the Gashacon Bugvisor II known as where he reverses the timestream of the Gashats, such as erasing Hyper Muteki from existence, by pressing and holding the B button. However, the Reset won't work on Save Energy Items which eventually led to the return of Hyper Muteki. As Gamedeus Cronus, he wields Gamedeus' DeuSlasher and Deus Rampart, which he uses even after losing his Gamedeus Cronus form, and assumes the Bugster's form that has the extendable arms and the sword-like leg. Masamune Dan is portrayed by . =Tsukuru Koboshi= is a 45-year-old video game developer who was on the Genm Corp. project team developing the Rider Gashats for five years. The company began to suffer financially after the sudden disappearance of his boss, Kuroto Dan, and Tsukuru tried to keep the company afloat by releasing new game Ju Ju Burger. Supported by other employees, Tsukuru led the development team under a new CEO, later revealed to be Ren Amagasaki, who is secretly the Bugster Lovrica working for Parad. They complete another game but it is corrupted with the Bugster Virus and Tsukuru is infected, with the Burgermon Bugster emerging from him. When he realized it was the likeness of his creation, Burgermon, he embraced his creation and became friends with the Bugster, which looked after him whenever the Game Disease made Tsukuru feel sick. Tsukuru developed the Ju Ju Burger Gashat using Kuroto's private terminals, in case he ever needed to go to CR to discuss his unique case. Burgermon caused a panic by going outside while hungry and was chased by Emu. Tsukuru intervened and tried to satisfy Burgermon by feeding him burgers with help from Ex-Aid Burger Action Gamer Level 4\\\\. Tusukuru became stressed and started to fade when the doctor Riders tried destroying Burgermon but recovered when Ex-Aid saved the Bugster. Later, Tsukuru witnessed the destruction of Burgermon by Genm Zombie Gamer Level X, his former boss who also confiscated the Gashat. While mourning Burgermon, Kuroto sprays Tsukuru with a Bugster Virus from his Gashacon Bugvisor, causing the Motors Bugster to manifest and attack Tsukuru's supporters in the company while also acting as bait for Ex-Aid. Returning to the CR, Tsukuru explains that when Kuroto became a fugitive, Genm Corp. went into a leadership crisis until the new CEO named Ren Amagasaki arrived. After Genm kills Motors, Tsukuru awakens and is quickly cured. Before Genm's invasion of Genm Corp., Taiga later uses the memory of Burgermon's death by Genm and a significant amount of money to recruit Tsukuru into making a Gashat for a game about killing zombies as he believes that it would be the key to countering the Dangerous Zombie Gashat. This leads to the development of Maximum Mighty X. Following Masamune's death, Tsukuru becomes the new CEO of Genm Corp., appointed by majority shareholder Nico, and Burgermon becomes a company mascot alongside Mighty. Tsukuru Koboshi is portrayed by . Bugsters The are micro-sized computer viruses known as that aim to destroy humanity in order to rule the world. Their origin is traced to the Year 2000 problem as an unexpected effect of the millennium turnover. Kuroto was the first person to discover the virus in his laptop. In 2011, Kuroto initiated Zero Day by spreading the virus and then framing his father, Masamune Dan, for the crime, which allowed him to rise as CEO of Genm Corp. However, this was actually planned by Masamune who secretly controlled the company from prison until Kamen Rider Chronicle was developed and both Riders and Bugsters engaged in battle. The Bugster themselves originate from the Bugster Virus, which are developed by infecting a human. Inside the infected human, they use the host's negative stresses in order to take control of them and become giant monsters known as . Once a Rider extracts the virus from their host in their Level 1 form, the virus manifests into a Bugster monster and is accompanied by a few Bugster Virus foot soldiers in various attire. The host body, though restored to normal, will gradually suffer the effects of a and can only be saved by quickly defeating the Bugster causing it, whether by destroying or sparing it. Otherwise, if Game Disease runs its course, the host disappears permanently and the Bugsters born from the host's body will gain a full manifestation, such as gaining human disguises. While Bugsters have manifested, the host's life force is slowly sapped. Negative stresses in the host can result in the appearance of additional Bugster Viruses and in some cases another copy of the Bugster monster. However, this can be counteracted by the host overcoming their negative stresses. If a Bugster's physical body is destroyed without having their essence absorbed into the Gashacon Bugvisor, they will die permanently. Only the fully manifested Bugsters like Graphite can be revived without having their virus debris being absorbed into the Gashacon Bugvisor, thus having an immortality resurrection. It is revealed in the Heisei Generation film that the Bugsters were born 16 years ago from the body samples of their very first victim and future Kamen Rider, Emu Hojo. Their birth from Emu's samples was the result of unrecorded experiments on Emu's body by Next Genome, Kuroto's contractor in 2010, right before the first Zero Day happened in 2011. This experiment was meant to breed stronger Bugsters as Emu had developed an antibody from the initial surgery. After Graphite tried to cause a second Zero Day with Proto Drago Knight Hunter Z, the Bugsters evolved further. Some are able to enter their monster form immediately, without having to become a Bugster Union first, and retain memories of past battles against the Riders. They also increased their level to match the Riders' newer forms. In Level 30, The Bugsters can transform into their Bugster form while also taking over the host's body, killing the host's mind from the inside. According to Parad, since the Bugsters are born from corresponding games, they tend to act like an A.I. which follows video gaming rules. Some take on an antagonist role from the game and fight their hosts while others behave as support characters and aid their hosts and the Kamen Riders. Though Bugsters may be in opposition, they follow the rules and never treat each other unfairly, unlike the way Kuroto treated his team member Motors. When Kuroto becomes a fugitive, the Bugsters reorganize under their new commander, Genm Corp's new CEO, Ren Amagasaki. With the Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashat completed, many Bugsters obtain their full manifestation without infecting the hosts, including Graphite's revival, with Ren brainwashing Poppy. Kamen Rider Chronicle Gashats are mass-produced and flood the market to destroy humanity with a pandemic, until Masamune returns to Genm Corp. and launches his own plans. =Parad= is one of the leaders of the Bugsters who takes the appearance of a teenager/young adult with pixel-themed pants. Lacking his own game correspondence, he is a manifestation of Emu's desire from his childhood to have a playmate. Although protective of his race and hateful of humanity's pride, the true purpose of his existence is to enjoy fighting Emu. Parad was the first Bugster to exist during Emu's infection and has since dominated as his gamer persona \\"M\\". His time within Emu's body helped the former to enjoy a long popularity as a gamer. After beating a young Nico in the 2010 Tekken tournament, the vigorous effort took a huge toll and he collapsed. During that time, scientists from Next Genome under Kuroto's request took advantage by harvesting the virus and separating Parad from Emu. Parad's departure allowed Emu to regain his ambition to become a doctor while retaining his gamer persona. In the present day, Parad joins forces with Kuroto to help him with Kamen Rider Chronicle's completion but would help his former host on certain occasions before completely deserting Kuroto for abusing Motors Bugster. After killing Kuroto and taking over the Kamen Rider Chronicle project, Parad completes it with help from Graphite and a brainwashed Poppy, planning to eliminate humanity for the Bugsters. Seeing how Emu prioritized saving Poppy, Parad possessed his host again and obtained his DNA sample, forcing the young intern to fight into the point of exhaustion before Genm's intervention. As a villain character in the Kamen Rider Chronicle game, Parad becomes afraid of being \\"permanently killed\\" as he attempts to face Masamune to avenge Lovrica. He confronts Emu instead, who needs to erase his Bugster counterpart to obtain the Perfect Knock Out Gashatrophy in the hopes to saving Nico. Parad ends up being \\"destroyed\\", metaphysically drowning while Emu loses his ability to transform. He was actually reabsorbed by Emu and was then released from his host using the Mighty Brothers XX Gashat, finally realizing the fear of death and becoming remorseful about his actions. Parad and Emu then resolve to end Kamen Rider Chronicle together. After Kamen Rider Chronicle is complete and Masamune fuses with the final boss to become Gamedeus Cronus, Poppy sacrifices herself to fuse with the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat to cure Gamedeus Cronus' Bugster-zombified victims and separate Gamedeus from Masamune. Parad then sacrifices himself by exposing himself and Gamedeus to the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat's antivirus, with his final words being for Emu to keep moving forward and fight as a regular human. But a fragment of Parad's data entered Emu's body, and Emu is able to reconstitute Parad. By his own, Parad demonstrated the ability to both teleport and block Lazer's Giri Giri Critical Finish without suffering any damage, while still in his human form. As he is Emu's Bugster, he is capable of existing as Genius Gamer M even after the Next Genome's operation split them. It was also through this link that he obtained Emu's DNA imprint in order to utilize Kuroto's Gamer Driver after goading the young intern to use Maximum Mighty X's reprogramming power. After the crisis in Heisei Generation, Parad disguises himself as a second Dr. Pac-Man in Kamen Rider Genm to support Kuroto in creating the Gambarizing Gashat and those themed after Bandai Namco games. Using data from Emu's Mighty Brothers XX Gashat, Kuroto manages to complete Parad's personal Gashat, the , for him to transform into without a Gamer Driver. According to Kuroto, Para-DX is a boss character for Kamen Rider Chronicle so he created the Gashat Gear Dual for Parad to utilize while the game was under development. The Gashat Gear Dual is composed of two Gashats for Para-DX to assume one of two Level 50 forms depending on which logo position he rotates its dial to before pressing its corresponding Gashat's button. He then inserts the Gashat Gear Dual into the strap-like on the right waist of his gold-colored . When activating either Gashat, a Game Area is created which generates several Energy Items with unique power-ups. Each of Para-DX's forms have a finisher that is activated by rotating the Gashat Gear Dual's dial to its neutral position, then rotating it back to its previous logo position, and finally inserting the Gashat Gear Dual back into the Gear Holder. *: A puzzle game-based Gashat that allows Para-DX to assume his blue-colored primary form, , where he is capable of manipulating any number of Energy Items within the Game Area by mixing their individual power-ups to enhance his attacks. He can also generate puzzle piece-like energy shields. Para-DX's finisher in this form is a Rider Kick known as the . *: A fighting game-based Gashat that allows Para-DX to assume his red-colored secondary form, , where he is equipped with his Puzzle Gamer form's shoulder pads as the gauntlet-like for enhanced punching. He can also generate fire via pyrokinesis. Para-DX's finisher in this form is a Rider Punch known as the . As Parad is partially Genius Gamer M, he dominated the Double Action Gamer Level XX R half and took full control of it while possessing Ex-Aid, forcing both Level XX halves to fight each other. Once he and Emu become allies, Parad can assume control of Double Action Gamer Level XX R to instead fight alongside Ex-Aid when the latter splits himself into his Level XX form. Parad later claims Kuroto's Gamer Driver as his own so he can use it in conjunction with the Gashat Gear Dual, which combines Perfect Puzzle and Knock Out Fighter into , to transform into a fusion of his Level 50 forms known as by inserting the Gashat Gear Dual while it is set to its neutral position into the Gamer Driver and then pulling its lever. His Gashacon Weapon in this form is the , which has two modes: Axe and Gun. Like the Gashacon Key Slasher, the Gashacon Parabragun can hold either two Gashats or one dual-based Gashat for Para-DX to perform its Critical Finish. Inserting Mighty Brothers XX into the Gashacon Parabragun allows Para-DX to temporarily split into his two Level 50 forms. By closing and pulling the Gamer Driver's lever a second time, he can perform one of three finishers depending on the Gashat Gear Dual's current position. In addition to both of the Gear Holder-based finishers, each activated by rotating between the Gashat Gear Dual's logo positions (Critical Combo via Perfect Puzzle and Critical Smash via Knock Out Fighter), this form has its own personal finisher known as the that is activated when the Gashat Gear Dual is in its neutral position. In Kamen Rider Para-DX Hyper Battle, together with Emu he gets the Knock Out Fighter 2 form. Parad is portrayed by . =Graphite= is a Draconic Warrior Bugster and one of the leaders of the Bugsters. He was born from the data of Drago Knight Hunter Z when its virus essence infected Saki Momose, gaining his own human form after completing his manifestation. Due to his part in Saki's death, he becomes a nemesis to both Hiiro and Taiga. Graphite resurfaces to monitor the infection of Bugster Viruses and face the Kamen Riders. After his Gashacon Bugvisor is revoked by Kuroto for his hasty decision to fight Brave, he stole Proto Drago Knight Hunter Z in Kuroto's place and spread the infection before he was killed by all four doctor Riders. He is resurrected by Parad a year later and upgraded to Level 99 in order to participate in Kamen Rider Chronicle. Seeing Cronus as a threat to their campaign, Graphite obtained a sample of Gamedeus and used his body to cultivate the virus. As the final high tier of Kamen Rider Chronicle, Graphite settles his score with Brave and Snipe while violently refusing Cronus' assistance. Graphite could only be defeated by Ride-Player Nico, who had earned the right as the only Ride-Player to successfully defeat all Bugsters in the game. Before his demise, Graphite thanks his allies and enemies alike for allowing him to fulfill his role as a game character. As a Bugster form, Graphite is known by the name and wields a fang-like double- bladed pole weapon called the . His forms includes: *His original form is a green colored Bugster transformed through the use of a Gashacon Bugvisor, which he also utilized as an infection device. He wore a Bugster Buckle on his waist but is never shown using it. His finisher is the . *After Kuroto revoked his Gashacon Bugvisor, Graphite steals the beta-test and transforms into the black-colored . This form increased his powers and allowed him to perform either the or the Do-Do-Do-Do Dark Dragon Sword. *After his resurrection, Graphite evolves into Level 99 and transforms into the crimson-colored , rivaling both Maximum Gamer and Perfect Knock Out Gamer. He wields the . Aside from pyrokinetic-based attacks, he can perform the . Through cultivation of Gamedeus' virus, Graphite can free himself from Cronus' Pause ability. Graphite is portrayed by . =Ren Amagasaki/Lovrica= first appears as the new CEO of Genm Corp., taking over when Kuroto Dan becomes a fugitive for his part in Zero Day. Ren is actually a Bugster known as the , a fully manifested Bugster born from the data of Toki Meki Crisis who can assume human form. While able to travel the physical and digital worlds, Ren also possesses the ability to alter a Bugsters' mind (as when making Poppy do his bidding) and breathe fire while in his human form. However, Ren is not truly sadistic and violent, though he is a manipulative ladies man. He is killed permanently by Kamen Rider Cronus, who used his Pause ability to negate Ren's traits and immortality resurrection. In Another Ending, during CR's project on reviving the sealed Bugster virus victims, Lovrica is also revived. He infects an American gamer named , who has a crush on Nico Saiba, and manipulates a revived Saki Momose, causing yet another conflict between Snipe and Brave. Originating from a dating-simulation game, Lovrica cannot be harmed by conventional attacks. However, he is vulnerable when he is heartbroken, such as when he is insulted or rejected by the females he flirts with, or when the Bugster Virus groupies accompanying him are deleted by Ex-Aid. Ren Amagasaki is portrayed by . The Lovrica Bugster's voice is portrayed by , the series' narrator. In his initial cameo, he was portrayed by an unidentified stand-in. =Gamedeus= , or the , is the final boss of Kamen Rider Chronicle who would only appear once all the are collected. Gamedeus has the ability to use other Bugsters' powers and is armed with both the sword-like and the shield-like . Kuroto calls him the ultimate Bugster whose power surpasses all the other Gashat games and that only Cronus can stop him. Parad and Graphite manage to extract a sample of Gamedeus' data from his Bugster Union body; Graphite injects the sample into his body to gain immunity to Cronus' Pause ability. When Gamedeus appears in his fully manifested form, Masamune's programming causes the Bugster to do his bidding, such as creating a full-scale Game Disease outbreak that spreads across Japan. Kiriya has Kuroto create the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat to cure all of the infected patients and weaken Gamedeus. Before Ex-Aid and Para-DX can finish Gamedeus, Cronus destroys Gamedeus' physical form and absorbs the virus data to assume the form of Gamedeus Cronus. After released from Masamune's body and reconstituted, Gamedeus is destroyed by Parad who exposes them both to the Doctor Mighty XX Gashat's antivirus. In True Ending, Machina Visions CEO, Johnny Maxima, appears to have obtained Gamedeus' virus in the original Gashacon Bugvisor he obtained after Graphite's defeat during Kamen Rider Chronicle crisis, transforming him into his own version of Gamedeus. Gamedeus is voiced by . =Bugster combatants= These Bugsters were born from the boss characters of their respective game series. The previously destroyed combatants were revived sometime after Graphite caused the second Zero Day and gained the ability to progress to higher levels. Excluding Burgermon and the Collabos, the defeated Bugsters' essences were collected by Kuroto's Gashacon Bugvisor in hopes of turning them into boss characters in Kamen Rider Chronicle.

Because of the digital nature of the methodology, data can be collected and analyzed as both a progress report and a preventative measure. Treatments are being developed for the prevention and management of a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including type II diabetes, congestive heart failure, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, asthma, substance abuse, ADHD, hypertension, anxiety, depression, and several others. Digital therapeutics often employ strategies rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy. Definitions Although digital therapeutics can be employed in numerous ways, the term can broadly be defined as a treatment or therapy that utilizes digital and often Internet-based health technologies to spur changes in patient behavior. The use of digital products to improve health outcomes dates as far back as 2000. The term itself has been in use since around 2012.http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn85765357&docId;=FTK20121101070417#docIndex=4&page;=1 The first mention of the term in a peer-reviewed research publication was in 2015, in which Dr. Cameron Sepah formally defined the field as: \\"Digital therapeutics are evidence-based behavioral treatments delivered online that can increase accessibility and effectiveness of health care.\\" Digital therapeutics can be used as a standalone therapy or in conjunction with more conventional treatments like pharmacological or in-person therapy. As of 2018, digital therapeutics continues to be an evolving field that medical professionals, students, and patients are beginning to utilize. The Digital Therapeutics Alliance states: \\"Digital therapeutics (DTx) deliver evidence- based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by high quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a broad spectrum of physical, mental, and behavioral conditions.\\"https://www.dtxalliance.org/dtx-solutions/ Digital therapeutics are different from wellness apps or medication reminders in that they require rigorous clinical evidence to substantiate intended use and impact on disease state. It is often used as a preventive measure for patients who are at risk of developing more serious conditions. For instance, a patient with prediabetes may be prescribed digital therapeutics as a method to change their diet and behavior that could otherwise lead to a diabetes diagnosis. Digital therapeutics can also be used as a treatment option for existing conditions. For instance, a patient with type II diabetes can use digital therapeutics to manage the disease more effectively. The methodology uses a variety of digital implements to help manage, monitor, and prevent illnesses in at-risk patients. These include mobile devices and technologies, apps, sensors, desktop computers, and various Internet of Things devices. These implements can collect a wide variety of data, ranging from big to small. Digital therapeutics can theoretically collect a high volume of data from a variety of sources. It also collects \\"smaller\\" data, \\"capturing personalized physiological parameters, behavior patterns and social and geographical patterns that can be recorded from multiple digital sources.\\" Methodologies Digital therapeutics can be used for a variety of conditions. There is no single methodology used in the practice of digital therapeutics. It uses methods rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy to spur patients to make lifestyle changes. The method can be used to manage and prevent numerous conditions, including type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung disease, obesity, substance abuse, ADHD, insomnia, hypertension, anxiety, depression, and others. Methodologies can be as simple as sending notifications designed to alter behavior to patients who are at risk of obesity or diabetes and as complex as administering an ingestible radio tag that communicates with an external sensor to monitor the efficacy of a given medication. Diabetes and obesity prevention and management is a major focus in the field of digital therapeutics. Connected devices like insulin pumps, blood glucose meters, and wearable gadgets can all send data to a unified system. The therapy also uses self-reported data like diet or other lifestyle factors. It is also often used to monitor the potential for heart and lung conditions and change behaviors like smoking, poor diet, or a lack of exercise. Digital therapeutics can also be used to treat patients with psychological and neurological symptoms. For example, patients with disorders like ADHD, depression, and anxiety can receive cognitive behavioral therapy via their mobile devices. One study looked at the efficacy of avatar-based therapeutic interventions to reduce depressive symptoms. Another study analyzed seven clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of a digital therapeutic in significantly reducing blood pressure. A preliminary study suggested that a mobile mindfulness app may be able to decrease acute stress while improving mood. Outcomes The general consensus among researchers in the field of digital therapeutics is that the discipline requires more clinical data and investigation to be fully evaluated. A variety of studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and impact of behavior change techniques that utilize a digital platform, however. In a meta-analysis of 85 such studies comprising a total sample size of over 43,000 participants, researchers discovered that digital therapeutics have a \\"statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior.\\" The study also showed that a broader use of theory, behavior change techniques, and modes of delivery (especially regular notifications) improved the efficacy of a given program. Individual studies have also showed some benefits for patients. For instance, a diabetes prevention program using digital therapeutics saw participants lose an average of 4.7% of baseline body weight after 1 year (4.2% after 2 years) and undergo a 0.38% reduction in A1c levels after 1 year (0.43% after 2 years). Another weight loss pilot program using digital therapeutics reported a mean weight loss of 13.5 pounds (or 7.3% of baseline) with a significant average drop in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (18.6 mmHg and 6.4 mmHg respectively). The study also saw a slight but statistically insignificant drop in total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, and A1c.

In recent years military branches have continued to implement anti-discrimination rules. Starting in 1973, the U.S. Government embarked on reforming sensitivity training which was given to all federal employees.Rosenbloom, David H. \\"The Civil Service Commission's Decision to Authorize the Use of Goals and Timetables in the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Program.\\" The Western Political Quarterly 26, no. 2 (1973): 236-51. The U.S. Army quickly followed with implementing these new changes. Following the creation of the \\"Don’t Ask Don’t Tell\\" policy in 1994 by the Clinton administration, the U.S. Army once again reorganized its stance on internal discrimination. \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" was repealed in 2010, allowing openly gay and lesbian military personnel to serve, and the Army EO Program was then established to protect both men and women from any form of discrimination from military personnel.Butler, John Sibley. \\"Affirmative Action in the Military.\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 523 (1992): 196-206. The controversial program has sparked great divisions among armed forces officials who wonder whether social comfort or unit cohesion, as well as combat efficiency, is more important to the U.S. Army.Teachman, Jay D., and Lucky Tedrow. \\"Divorce, Race, and Military Service: More than Equal Pay and Equal Opportunity.\\" Journal of Marriage and Family 70, no. 4 (2008): 1030-044. Origins The U.S. Army's first step toward diversity training and appreciation came via the Army Language Program (ALP) in 1946, shortly after the institution's involvement in World War II. The U.S. Army advocated for the expansion of spoken languages other than English among its armed forces personnel in order to attain a strategic military advantage.Sokol, A. E. \\"The Army Language Program.\\" The Journal of Higher Education 17, no. 1 (1946): 9-16. The ALP marks the first step toward the inclusion philosophy that permeates the current Army EO Program. The proposal set the groundwork for the U.S. Army's EO Program first introduced in 1973 via the Civil Service Commission. The U.S. government acknowledged a disconnect that existed between anti-discrimination philosophy and the day-to-day functions of its federal institutions and employees. In 1973, the Civil Service Commission first authorized the use of goals and timetables to counter and eventually eliminate rising discrimination in U.S. federal government work. The goals created centered on strengthening one minority group at a time. These groups included African Americans, religious denominations other than Christianity, mentally and physically disabled individuals, and women. Composing a timetable was difficult for the Civil Service Commission because they were skeptical about whether the changes would impact the efficiency of federal work. Even though the fundamentals of the Army EO Program were authorized, a plan to fully implement it had yet to be devised. Development of the program The U.S. Army began to experience a negative stigma in the 1970s and 1980s due to rampant sexual, racial, and gender discrimination. The U.S. government was then motivated to institute the anti-discrimination agenda they formulated in the early 1970s. The first governmental action to eliminate the progression of discrimination in the armed forces was to correct the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The UCMJ are the written laws of the United States Military. The UCMJ was made more responsive to all forms of discrimination by writing into law that the punitive measure for any military personnel engaging in that line of behavior to be an Article 15. An Article 15 is the official form of punitive discrimination for violation of the UCMJ that can result in company level punishment or a criminal charge.Griffin, Mary C. \\"Making the Army Safe for Diversity: A Title VII Remedy for Discrimination in the Military.\\" The Yale Law Journal 96, no. 8 (1987): 2082-109. As a result of the changes the U.S. Army made to its legal system regarding discrimination, it was clear that a program that protected victims of discrimination, and helped prevent soldiers from becoming perpetrators of discrimination was needed. The U.S. Army first sought to develop a program that created a specific course of action for victims of discrimination to report acts committed against them. EO offices were established on military bases to conduct the discrimination reporting and investigation processes. The U.S. Army also felt they needed to promote mandatory training that informed soldiers about what is considered a discriminatory action and how they could prevent it.Knowles, James A., Greg H. Parlier, Gregory C. Hoscheit, Rick Ayer, Kevin Lyman, and Robert Fancher. \\"Reinventing Army Recruiting.\\" Interfaces 32, no. 1 (2002): 78-92. Army equal opportunity training Starting in the late 20th century, and continuing into the 21st century, U.S. Army senior officers and congressional officials developed a process for teaching soldiers to competently approach diversity. The method consisted of annual training for all soldiers about how to avoid racial, sexual, and gender discrimination as well as the consequences for UCMJ violations. In addition, soldiers were to be educated about the formal process for reporting any violations of the Army EO policy under UCMJ protocol.Gropman, Alan L. \\"Blacks in the Military: The Equal Opportunity Imperative.\\" The National Interest, no. 48 (1997): 77-81. https://www.jstor.org/stable/42897126 The program began to gain military-wide traction at the beginning of the 21st century as formal training took place annually regarding micro-aggressions, and victimized soldiers began reporting violations. The number of cases pertaining to EO violations were too many for senior officers to handle efficiently. An amendment was made to the Army EO Program consisting of enlisted Army EO representatives that would be more accessible to soldiers.White, William. \\"Army Trains Future Equal Opportunity Leaders.\\" Www.army.mil. April 15, 2015. Accessed November 02, 2016. =Army Equal Opportunity representatives= United States Army EO representatives are non-commissioned officers trained to report, instruct, and know the legal policy of discriminatory behavior in the armed forces. These individuals serve as advocates, mediums, and decision-makers for cases of discrimination against victimized soldiers. In order for a non-commissioned officer to become an EO representative, s/he must receive an appointment from Army command, pass a background investigation, and complete extensive sensitivity and legal training. Furthermore, each U.S. Army unit has an EO representative who is in charge of cases of discrimination within that particular unit, and reports violations to U.S. Army judicial officials. U.S. Army EO representatives also assist in company, battalion, and brigade level training for soldiers. These representatives conduct role-playing, videoing, and situational based training that are designed to foster awareness among soldiers. EO representatives are ultimately held responsible for the racial, sexual, and cultural sensitivity within their respective units. Controversy Despite the recent dramatic decrease of social hostility and discrimination in the U.S. Army as a result of the EO Program, many individuals still find ways to criticize it. The primary argument consists of the possible side effects of \\"over-sensitizing\\" the armed forces. The U.S. Army operates in a male-dominant environment where extreme aggression is praised. Teaching soldiers to be compassionate of others feelings and insecurities can appear to some soldiers as counterproductive. The current popularity of the Army EO Program hinges on its ability to effectively blend combat aggression and toughness with cultural sensitivity. The most prominent modern example of this dilemma for armed forces officials is the ambivalence that exists toward women operating in combat Military Occupational Specialties (MOS). The Army EO program protects the fair treatment of women in combat-related positions under the UCMJ; however, military culture often characterizes female combat soldiers as inferior and counter-productive.Chowdhry, Prem. \\"Women in the Army.\\" Economic and Political Weekly 45, no. 31 (2010): 18-20. =Don't Ask Don't Tell= \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" was a U.S. military policy that discouraged the open expression of LGBT service men and women in terms of their sexuality. Removal from the armed forces was the punitive measure for violation of this policy. Coinciding with the establishment of the Army EO Program, the Clinton administration worked to repeal \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" in accordance with Army EO policy. In many ways, the legacy of \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" continues to be linked to the Army EO Program both in legality and social stigma. Many soldiers who supported \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" now openly criticize the Army EO Program for the same reasons. They primarily connect back to the question regarding whether combat efficiency or preventing discrimination among units in the armed forces is more important to the long-term vitality of the United States Army.Estes, Steve. \\"Ask and Tell: Gay Veterans, Identity, and Oral History on a Civil Rights Frontier.\\" The Oral History Review 32, no. 2 (2005): 21-47.

Life Conrad II was the son of Prince Luitpold of Znojmo and his wife Ida, a daughter of the Babenberg margrave Leopold II of Austria. Upon his father's death in 1112, Znojmo passed to his uncle Ulrich I of Brno, who died the next year. From 1115 onwards, both the Brno and Znojmo principalities in Moravia were held by Soběslav I, youngest son of the late King Vratislaus II of Bohemia. Finally, when Soběslav fell out with his elder brother Duke Vladislaus I of Bohemia in 1123, Conrad II was able to succeed his father in Znojmo. However, Duke Vladislaus died two years later and as the dynastic struggles culminated in the 1126 Battle of Chlumec, Soběslav had Conrad II deposed and imprisoned at Dohna Castle in 1128. In an attempt to reconcile with his Moravian cousin and to stabilise his rule in the Bohemian lands, Duke Soběslav reinstalled Conrad as Znojmo prince and also arranged his marriage with the Vukanović princess Mary (d. 1189), a daughter of Grand Prince Uroš I of Serbia. When in 1140 Vladislaus II, son of the late Duke Vladislaus I, succeeded to the Bohemian throne, the Přemyslid quarrels broke out again.

However, while the castle was successfully defended by the duke's younger brother Prince Děpold I of Jamnitz, Vladislaus II himself proceeded to the court of King Conrad III of Germany in Würzburg and returned with a large royal army.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the shrublands and mountainsides of Palestine and Israel. It has smooth, linear or lanceolate, greyish-green leaves. Long slender stem and in Spring, (between March and April) large, fragrant flowers in shades of deep purple, violet, purple, brownish purple or dusky lilac veining or speckling over a pale ground. It has a dark purple, black-brown, to blackish signal patch, and a beard, which is variable from dark purple, white, or dark tipped yellow. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. Description It is a geophyte, with a stout rhizome,British Iris Society (1997) and small brown stolons. They are below the surface of the ground, they all form clumps of plants. It has between 5 and 8 leaves, which are smooth, linear,John Weathers or lanceolate, greyish-green. They can grow up to between long, and between 1 and 1.5 cm wide. They grow in the spring and then fade after the summer. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall.James Cullen, Sabina G. Knees, H. Suzanne Cubey (Editors) The stems carry the flowers high above the foliage. The stems hold terminal (top of stem) flowers, blooming in spring, between March and April. The fragrant flowers, are in diameter, they come in shades of deep purple, violet, purple, brownish purple, or dusky lilac. Normally veined or spotted over a pale, or pale pink-violet background. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The oblong or ovate, (rounded,) and recurved (bent backwards) falls are long and 4–6 cm wide. They are more densely veined and spotted than the standards. The incurved (bent forwards), standards are long and 6–7 cm wide. In the centre of the falls, is a dark purple, black-brown, to blackish signal patch, also, in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are variable, from dark purple, white, or dark tipped yellow. Although, a semi-albino form with a white-yellowish, or golden yellow flower and a dark red signal patch has been recorded. It has a 2.5 cm long perianth-tube, and after the iris has flowered, it produces an loculicidal (meaning it has chambers) seed capsule, inside the seeds have a method of delaying germination, for up to several years, so that they can re-produce plants following periods of droughts. =Biochemistry= In 2002, a genetic analysis study was carried out on I. haynei and Iris atrofusca in Israel. To find the DNA markers and phenotypic variation. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=20. It was counted in 1977 by Avishai & Zohary, then published in 1980. Taxonomy It is written in Hebrew by אירוס הגלבוע, and in Arabic as سوسن فقوعة. It has the common name of 'Gilboa Iris'. 'Mount Gilboa Iris'. 'Iris of Mount Gilboa',Zev Nave or 'Irus Ha-Gilboa'. The Palestinian name is 'Sawsan Gilboa'. The Latin specific epithet haynei refers to William Amherst Hayne (1847–1873), (from Trinity College Cambridge),Henry Baker Tristram who was a botanist, who went with Tristram, to the ruins of Ataruz and Machaerus (Mukawir) in 1873.Carlos E. Cordova Although one source mistakenly, thought it was named after Friedrich Gottlob Hayne (1763–1832). It was originally found in Palestine, on Mount Gilboa, by Hayne in April 1872, and then it was first published and described by John Gilbert Baker in The Gardeners' Chronicle Vol.6 on page 710 in 1876. This description was based on dried samples of plants that Haynes had originally found. Although occasionally, it is claimed that the plants author is Mallet (George B. Mallett, 1955– ), (as I. haynei (Baker) Mallet ) as it was thought to be called Iris hayne before 1905, and then published in 'Gardeners' Chronicle' Vol.35 on page 266 in 1904, but this has been rejected by other information sources. It was also published in 'Journal of the RHS' Vol.29 Proceedings on page112 in 1905. It was thought originally to be closely related to Iris sari, and was once also thought to be a form of Iris atrofusca, but after genetic testing in 2001, it was found to be a separate but linked species. It is listed as I. haynei in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life. I. haynei is a tentatively accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate to Western Asia. =Range= right It is endemic to the ancient Samaria region, of northeastern Israel, within the Lower Galilee region, (including on Mount Tabor), in the Beit Shean Valley, and found on Mount Gilboa. Some small populations of the iris, can be found in the Judean Desert, and near to the kibbutz of Ein Gev. But it can also cross adjacent borders, such as the Israeli West Bank barrier Separation Wall between Israel and Palestine, by being found on the northern West Bank. =Habitat= It grows in Mediterranean woodlands, shrublands, and on rocky hillsides. It is found on soils containing limestone, and dolomite, or at the edges of fields in terra rossa. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Pollination I. haynei like many other Oncocyclus irises species, can be pollinated by night-sheltering solitary male bees (eucerine bees), who are attracted to the heat reward of the dark flowers. Unlike other plants, the floral size of I. haynei, is not an advantage for larger flowers and taller plants in attracting pollinators, over smaller plants such Iris tuberosa, compared to Iris atropurpurea and Iris gracilipes, where the large flowers does make an advantage, and has affected the evolution of flowers in I. atropurpurea. =Synecology= On Mount Gilboa, the iris can be found growing alongside Ferula communis and Euphorbia hierosolymitana, near Pistacia lentiscus and Ceratonia siliqua, and at the edges of planted Aleppo pine forests. Conservation right In 1950's the iris suffered from widespread picking, by plant dealers and visitors, also locals from nearby kibbutz, had collected the iris to make wreathes to decorate their rooms. It soon became very rare and endangered. In 1959, all Oncocyclus irises in Israel were listed as 'Very Rare'. Then in 1963, the Nature Reserves acts was established in Israel, the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel with a Parliamentary lobby also initiated a special law for the protection of 95% of wildlife, including many threatened plants. It included the designation of 30 National Parks and 145 sites as nature reserves, which were administrated by Nature Conservation Authority. The 1964 'Species Protection Law' and the 'Endangered Species Law' includes various irises. Then in 1964, the Nature Reserves Authority (NRA) was established to enforce the act and manage the various reserves. The creation of nature reserves and wild plant protection law has saved the plant from extinction, Some of the reserves were set up specifically due to the presence of 'Oncocyclus' irises, including on Mount Gilboa. The iris can also be found in the nature reserves of Nahal Misgav, Nahal Qedesh, Nahal Dishon and Nahal Bet Ha'emek in Upper Galilee, Nazareth, Har Yona and Giv'at Ha-more in Lower Galilee and in Hula Valley within Ein Avazim. It is also found in Jalaboun (Important Plant Area), which has a typical Mediterranean climate and consists of open 'maquis' (chaparral), with olive groves and fields of wheat and pasture. Also a public education campaign. including school teaching programmes, pamphlets and posters, stopped the public picking the wild plants. It was also thought that within the nature reserves, there needed to be controlled cattle grazing to reduce plant competition from aggressive grasses, herbs and thistles. Also the creation of the wall between Israel and Palestine (since 2002), has also affected its habitat. Several hundred flower groups were trans-located to the Mount Barkan area of Mount Gilboa. Although, most of these plants died between 2–10 years, due to dense pine tree plantations. In 2015, it was listed as rare, on the West Bank of Palestine, and parts of Israel (except on Mount Gilboa). On 24 February 2016, it was assessed by the IUCN as Vulnerable. It has a restricted habitat of less than 100 km2 . It is now part of Jerusalem Botanical Gardens preservation project, which includes seed collection. =Mount Gilboa controversy= right right Tourists coming to Mount Gilboa to see the iris Before the creation of the Mount Gilboa Nature Reserve, the iris was threatened by deforestation, in 1950, the Jewish National Fund (JNF) led by Yosef Weitz, built a village near the Arab towns (on the Mount) to provide a new site for Jewish emigrants from Yemen. Afterwards, 47,000 saplings were planted on the hillsides. But most of these plants died due to drought in 1951 and excessive rain in 1952. Weitz carried on planting trees, by 1960, he had planted 355,000 trees on 170 dunams with on a 2% not surviving. Although Azariah Alon (co-founder of the SPNI), who lived nearby called the foresters \\"barbarians\\". They destroyed native vegetation with fire and planted pines and eucalyptus. Alon then confronted Sharon Weitz (Yosef's son and head of the northern region Forestry Department). Azariah used his radio show to put forward his arguments. Yosef agreed to a change in the tree plans, and left the upper region of Barkan Mount, unplanted. Also many of the other pine trees died due to being planted too dense. Parts of the mount, could not be re- forested due to high amounts of kaolinite clay, which stopped tree growth. By February 1966, the populations of the iris were very scattered, making reproduction via pollination very difficult, also they were attacked by porcupines and rodents. Then in the spring of 1967, a conservationist (Palti Sela, a ranger in the Israel Nature and Parks Authority) with various assistants and friends, transplanted iris groups to make large groups. Also they used the 'tweezers method', to fertilize the irises. In 1970, a nature reserve on the mount, was created to protect the iris and other endemic wildflowers, then in 1976 and 1977, 170 plant species were counted on Mount Gilboa, including I. haynei.G. M. Woodwell In 2003, an eco-friendly settlement (called 'Michal' with 120 housing units) was planned to be built on the eastern slope of the mount, it was proved by the INPA, who managed the land. Then in 2005, the 'Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel' (SPNI) carried out a survey on the mount (the site of the new proposed settlement), and over 3,500 iris plants were recorded. A coalition of Israeli scientists and the SPNI had objected to the planned settlement of 'Michal', which would risk \\"total extinction\\" of the iris. Although, the settlement was planned for energy-efficient homes, built with recycled materials, and the use of native plants. \\"We want to live with nature\\" said software engineer Aviv Harary. Also all the iris in the way would have been be transplanted before the construction begins. In reply, Michael Avishai, scientific director of the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens said that pollinating insects would have to compete with other insects introduced by the settlement gardens and agriculture. Another scientist warned that the light, pets, gardens, and utilities from the settlement could affect an area on the mountain 10 times larger than its footprint of homes. The SPNI also worked with The Gilboa Guard (or Mishmar Hagilboa) a local grassroots organization to provide opposition to the plan.Liam Leonard and Sya Buryn Kedzior (Editors) Likud legislator Omri Sharon, son of the former prime minister, was in favour of the settlement. Eventually the settlement was abandoned. Later another nature reserve was created (by the government on the development site) to protect the iris and other endangered wildflowers on the mount, The cancellation of the plan, then enforced the status of the SPNI, as an environmental organisation and public representative, and now proved in law. In 2012, the mount then became the site of a new public battle between the JNF and the SPNI. In 2006, Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) agreed to pass over its forest lands (or woodlands) to the JNF, this would alter the status of many acres of land. The parks authority looks after about 6 million dunams (1.5 million acres), and the JNF has 1.2 million dunams (300,000 acres). The agreement meant that the JNF would not interfere in the declaration of nature reserves in other places in Israel. The SPNI were very concerned about the agreement, as the JNF is more interested in construction and development instead of nature protection. Also the status of forest gives less protection to the open space rather than the status of nature reserve. The SPNI had even included Mount Gilboa in its list of threatened sites. Professor Yoram Yom-Tov of Tel Aviv University, was one of 60 scientists who signed an open letter against the transfer. He said \\"Transferring these lands to the JNF is a grave mistake\\". The SPNI wanted part of Mount Gilboa become a nature reserve, that it would co-manage with the JNF, but this was rejected. Dr. Omri Boneh said the Society's plan was rejected due to local councils opposition. Iris expert Dr. Yuval Sapir told a committee of scientific experts at the parks authority that \\"some forest ranger who doesn't know the management instructions for the area could come along and plow it up or spray it.\\" The feud between the two groups also includes the Tu Bishvat planting ceremony by JNF of oak trees in the Lower Galilee's Beit Keshet (a kibbutz, near Nazareth). The SPNI wanted the site to be nature reserve. Also a new law was being discussed by the Israeli Agriculture Ministry to establish a forestry authority. The JNF think they are best placed to run it, but the SPNI deputy director general Nir Papai told Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan that the JNFs \\"organizational and statutory structure are unsuitable for the structure required by a government authority managing forests.\\" Cultivation thumb 'Oncocyclus Section' Irises are easier to grow than 'Regelia Section' irises. In general, they need good drainage, minimal summer rainfall and dry winters, similar to a semi-arid climate. In temperate areas (such as the Europe and America), they are only suitable for growing by specialist iris growers, within a bulb frame or greenhouse. They can be grown under glass (in frames), to protect the irises from excess moisture (especially during winter times) and also to ensure the (shallow planted) rhizomes get the best temperatures during the growing season. They can be grown in pots (especially in deep ones known as 'long toms'), but they need re-potting, every 2 years and extra feeding. Watering is one of the most critical aspects of iris cultivation. It can suffer from aphids, viruses and rots. =Propagation= right Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Oncoyclus irises dislike division, but it should only be carried out when the plant is overcrowded. Although hand pollination and germinating seedlings gives better results. =Hybrids and cultivars= Iris haynei has the following recorded cultivar names; 'Biggeri' and 'Haynei'. Known I. haynei crosses include; 'Arabian Knight' (Iris gatesii X I. haynei), 'Galeet' (crossed with Iris hermona), 'Gilmond' (crossed with Iris hermona), 'Judean Bronze' (crossed with Iris auranitica), 'Shah Azul' (crossed with Iris 'Judean Cream'), and 'Syrian Dawn'. I. haynei is the grandparent in the following crosses; 'Gethsemane', 'Shany' (Iris atropurpurea x I. haynei), and 'Syrian Scroll' (Iris gatesii x I. haynei). Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Culture It was also used for a postage stamp on 26 December 1978, part of a series of wild flowers. One source states that Iris bismarckiana (also known as 'Iris nazareth') was chosen, as the logo of The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel in 1970, but it was in fact I. haynei.Alon Tal On Mount Gilboa, there is a trail between March and April to see the iris in flower, thousands can walk the trail. In 2012, it also inspired a book, The Gilboa Iris by Zahava D Englard, who is also a journalist, the book is a romance set on Mount Gilboa. On 5 April 2016, the Ministry of Environmental Affairs (Palestine) had adopted 'Sawsan Gilboa' (I. haynei) as the national plant of the State of Palestine, to go with the Olive tree (as the national tree), Palestine sunbird (national bird) and the 5th of March to be the national day for the Palestinian environment.

After hearing the story of a young girl in St. Louis who was forced to give her alcoholic father all of her earned money, Marsh decided to provoke change. However, at the time, the state of Missouri did not allow women to take part in political matters. In order to push the law to the Missouri Senate, Marsh had to find a man who would draft and advocate for the law. Luckily, Marsh had a variety of connections to look into. Missouri legislator Alroy Phillips became the spokesman who would address the Senate with the Joint Guardianship Law. =The Marsh Joint Guardianship Law= The Marsh Joint Guardianship Law is formally known as, Guardians and Curators of Minors-Granting Married Women Equal Rights With Husbands in Care of Minor children and Management of Their Estates. The act is divided into seven sections: The first, who were natural guardians of minors. The second, married woman may be curators and guardians. Third, minors, by whom bound. The fourth, executor may bind child, when. The fifth, services and earnings of minor children-custody and control of. Sixth, rights of parents equal, in custody or control of minor children, of their services and earnings-court to adjudicate. Finally the seventh, inconsistent acts repealed. Proposal Sixteen states had already adopted the Joint Guardianship law, and Marsh would go on to make Missouri the seventeenth. On October 12, 1912, Marsh presented the idea of the law to the Daughters of the American Revolution. With widespread support by the Douglas Oliver chapter of the D.A.R., the act was presented to the D.A.R. state conference in Kansas City, Missouri. Again, there was great agreement that the law of sole guardianship should be changed. Thanks to the rich influence of representation attributed to the D.A.R., six thousand women pledged to the bill. The movement began to pick up speed, and finally, the old law was repealed. The next step for Marsh was to get the new law implemented. Marsh prepared an eight page long proposal that explained the reasoning behind the cause. After review, the Missouri State Senate passed the new law on March 20, 1913. The act also included a new law to those who are mentally unstable, known as: Guardians and Curators of Insane Persons-Facts Inquires Into by Court Sitting as a Jury. This law was passed on March 18, 1913. =Literary contributions= After her political contributions in 1913, Marsh began to write. Perhaps the most famous work of Marsh's is Young Abe Lincoln; a cotton bowl of Lincoln stories founded on tradition, narrated by Aunt Ann of Indiana. Published in 1929, the story was meant as a persuasion to implement a proposed memorial for Lincoln and his family in Spencer, Indiana. Marsh also wrote Missouri Anthology (1936) with Charles Garrett Vannest. Among her many achievements, she received the honor of \\"Missouri's Poet Laureate\\" in 1928 by the St. Louis chapter of the Daughters of 1812. Young Abe Lincoln Death After fighting against heart disease, Marsh was moved to Bethesda General Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. She remained there for 22 days until she suffered from cardiac decompensation and passed on September 21, 1946. She is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis in the same lot as her husband and other relatives including Olydia, Frank, Mildred, and Angeline Marsh.

Starting in 1944 he worked for Agence France-Presse (AFP). In the 1950s and 1960s he was employed by several United Nations organizations such as WHO. In April and May 1945 he documented the atrocities in Nazi concentration camps.  Life and work  Eric Schwab was born in Hamburg in 1910. He was the son of a Frenchman and a German woman who were persecuted and deported during the Nazi regime because of their Jewish origin. Supposedly he came to Paris in the 1930s, where he worked as a photographer and reporter. In 1939 he was drafted into military service. After the Battle of Dunkirk in June 1940 he was interned by the Germans, but managed to escape after a few weeks while on a train packed with prisoners and bound for Germany. He returned to Paris, where he began working as a photographer again. He joined the French Resistance. The research of Annette Wierviorka next locates him near the Loire River in 1944, fighting with the French Forces of the Interior as the Resistance was then known.Annette Wiervorka: 1945, the discovery, here quoted from the article of AFP, 13 February 2015 Due to the Jewish origins of his mother he had to be very cautious and had to hide from Nazis which had anti- Jewish laws implemented also in occupied France. His mother was deported to Theresienstadt in 1943. = Documentation of Nazi concentration camps in 1945 = Schwab was among the first photographers who, in 1944, joined the newly founded Agence France-Presse (AFP). Together with American journalist and writer Meyer Levin he travelled to Germany in April 1945, right after the liberation from the Nazi regime. According to Agence France-Presse, they were ″travelling together into the darkness on board their jeep \\"Spirit of Alpena\\". Both were on a painful quest, Levin to investigate the fate of Europe's Jews in World War II, and Schwab to find his mother who was deported in 1943.″Yves Gacon: Eric Schwab, photographing the unspeakable, Agence France-Presse (Paris), 13 February 2015 Levin and Schwab documented Nazi crimes in the concentration camps Buchenwald, Leipzig-Thekla and Dachau. When they arrived at Theresienstadt concentration camp Schwab was reunited with his mother whom he had believed dead. Schwab's most notable work is the portrait called Dysenteric dying from Buchenwald. Although liberated the man died a few minutes after the photograph of him was taken. David Bowie chose this picture as Photograph of the Century in Die Zeit in 1998, at the time saying \\"In my eyes this photograph is the expression of violence and destruction that dominated large parts of the 20th century. The horrific tragedy of a man dying just after he regained his freedom is breaking one's heart.\\"http://www.musix- online.de/remembrance/remembrance-3.htm Still in 1945, Schwab went to Norway for reportage. = New York = In 1946, Schwab moved to New York City, together with his mother. There he continued working for AFP, however now devoting himself to serene subjects. He observed and photographed the activities on Broadway, the swimmers at Coney Island or the Jazz clubs of Harlem. In the archives of AFP, a series of photographs of Nat King Cole at the Apollo Theater in Harlem was found. The images stem from 1950.New York Daily News: 3  16 Nat King COle at the Apollo Theater, accessed 3 October 2016 = In the service of United Nations organizations = In the early 1950s, Schwab left AFP and went on assignment for several UN organizations to visit the developing countries of the Philippines (1959) or Ethiopia (1961) – both on behalf of the World Health Organization (WHO). =Death= Schwab died in 1977 at the age of 67 – without having left a report about his journey to the Nazi concentration camps and the reunion with his mother at Theresienstadt. He was survived by his daughter, Corinne Schwab.  Perception  Photographs by Schwab were reprinted by many media – often without crediting his name as the copyrights were owned by AFP. It has been confirmed that the German magazine Stern published some of his pictures. Photographs by Schwab were also shown in several exhibitions, amongst them the exhibit Photographies des camps de concentration which was organized by the Musée national de la Résistance in 2005.Bibliothèque nationale de France (Archives et manuscrits): Fonds Delbo, Charlotte (théâtre), accessed 3 October 2016.

The name Chameleon comes from the fact that the machine was able to change its \\"skins\\", which are different sound engines. The Chameleons were produced from 2002 to 2004, until the company went bankrupt.  Internal structure  The Chameleon was built around two processors: * a 24-bits fixed point Motorola DSP56303 Digital Signal Processor, clocked at 100 MHz * a 32-bits ColdFire microcontroller (model MCF5206), clocked at 40 MHz Each processor has its own dedicated DRAM (4MWords for the DSP, 8MB for the microcontroller). The system stores the operating system (RTEMS), the firmware for the microcontroller and the DSP code into a 1MB Flash. When the Chameleon starts, the ColdFire boots the RTOS and its own application from the Flash. It then loads the DSP using the DSP HPI (Host Port Interface). The microcontroller communicates with its environment using two serial ports. The first serial port is connected to the MIDI interface. The second serial port is connected to the front panel circuit board. The front panel has its own microcontroller, used to control the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and the various push-buttons, knobs and potentiometers on the front panel. The RS232 debug port located at the back is used to upload new \\"skins\\" in the Chameleon, from the development environment running on a PC. The debug port is connected to the front panel board which acts as a bridge with the Chameleon main board.  Open software architecture  The Chameleon was designed since the beginning as a completely open architecture system. A complete access was given to the two processors. Writing a \\"skin\\" requires then to write two programs: the DSP program (written normally in assembly), for the real-time audio processing the microcontroller program (written normally in C), for the MIDI, control rate processing and user interface tasks To simplify system integration, the Chameleon runs on RTEMS real-time operating system. The whole MIDI communication is handled by the MIDIShare library. The Chameleon Development Kit contained all the software tools required to write a complete skin: the Motorola Suite56 DSP tools for the DSP the GNU C compiler for the ColdFire the Chameleon Development environment (CDE) the Chameleon Toolkit A \\"skin\\" had to be written using the two first tools, the CDE acting an Integrated Development Environment (the CDE was in charge of calling the required tools depending on the file to generate) Once the \\"skin\\" had been generated by the CDE, the Chameleon Toolkit was used to upload the different files within the Chameleon hardware through the RS232 port. The tool package also included all required libraries to interface with RTEMS, MIDIShare, DSP communication libraries, etc. Although the development environment was considered as highly professional and facilitating as much as possible the design of \\"skins\\", the Chameleon remained a machine that required knowledge in multiple domains (MIDI, digital signal processing, real-time operating system, etc.). Even if the Chameleon was designed to allow any user to create its own \\"skin\\", the vast majority of them were made by Soundart programmers only, and only a few skins were made by user (a noticeable one being the Monowave, written by English programmer Paul Maddox). Most users were expecting more skins to be available, with caught almost all resources from Soundart, leading the company in turn to bankrupt as it could not face the related costs.  Chameleon MkII  In July 2004, Soundart announced that a new version of Chameleon was being designed.http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2004/07/12/soundart-chameleon- updated-to-mkii/ This new version, called Chameleon mkII, provided a lot of enhancements compared to the first model: * 4 analog audio inputs (2 for the first version) * 6 analog audio outputs (2 for the first version) * more powerful DSP * S/P-DIF digital audio interface * one input can be switched to microphone input * Flash card slot to store skins and sounds * USB interface to replace the RS-232 interface * Internal power supply New soundskins dedicated to mkII were also announced (SID emulator, electric piano, Phase Distortion synthesizer, etc.) but they were never presented. The Chameleon mkII was announced to be available in 2005, but it never came into production, as the company went bankrupt before. It is assumed that the mkII never existed physically, even in term of prototype, since no photos of the machine could ever be seen. Only a computer rendered image exists of this machine.  Chameleon nowadays  The production of Chameleon stopped totally in 2004. A group of enthusiasts has created a dedicated website, in order to continue to provide informations to developers who want to write their own \\"skins\\".http://www.chameleon.synth.net/english/index.shtml This website provides the whole documentation package, the original toolchain and the source code of a few commercial skins. Closed-source skins are also available in form of binary files. The maintenance of existing Chameleons is however quite difficult, since the two main chips (DSP and ColdFire processor) are not manufactured anymore. Moreover, the schematics are not available. Consequently, a dead motherboard means most of the time that the Chameleon can not be repaired.  Other hardware plugin hosts  The Chameleon was not the only hardware host designed to run plugins on a DSP. Other machines have been marketed with similar concepts. It shall be noted that machines listed here all use a DSP to perform real-time audio processing. They differ from Linux- based plugins hosts, like the Muse Receptor or SM ProAudio V-Machine. These machines are computers, very similar to PC, running a special version of Linux along with a Wine layer to emulate Windows. The processing is performed on x86 processor, not on a dedicated DSP. = Creamware Noah = The Noah has been designed by German company Creamware.http://www.sequencer.de/synth/index.php/Creamware_Noah It was produced from 2003 to 2006, until Creamware went bankrupt. The Noah was built around Analog Devices' SHARC DSP, with 32 bits floating point support (the DSP56300 inside the Chameleon is 24 bits fixed point). The Noah is designed to run the plugins originally designed for the Creamware DSP expansion boards (B2003, Minimax, Pro-One, Lightwave, etc.). It is not possible for the user to create and load its own plugins in the Noah. = Use Audio Plugiator / ASX / iCON X-Synth = The Plugiator module,http://www.use-audio.com/plugiator.htm the ASX (Authentic Sound eXpansion) boardhttp://www.use-audio.com/asx.htm and the iCON X-Synth board http://iconproaudio.com/product/x-synth are basically the same product, designed by Indian company inDSP. This company was founded by a former Creamware associate. When Creamware ceased activities, the associates reached an agreement that they may re-use the source code from original Creamware products. InDSP then created a very low cost platform, based on ADSP-21364 DSP associated with an ATMega32 microcontroller. The only difference between the Plugiator and the ASX/X-Synth is that Plugiator has a very simplified user interface, which allows stand alone operation, while the ASX requires to be installed in a master keyboard (made by CME for the ASX, or made by iCON for the X-Synth). The ASX and the X-Synth have exactly the same circuitry, the only difference between the two being the type of connector used to interface with host keyboard. Seven plugins were created from the original Creamware source (Minimax, LightWave, B8000, Vocoder, Prodyssey, Pro12 and FMagia), and an eighth one was created specifically for the new platform (Drums&Bass;). The Plugiator has then a very similar sound to Noah and older Creamware DSP boards. The inDSP systems are delivered with 3 plugins pre-installed, the Vocoder being available for free once users have been registered. The four other plugins must be purchased separately. The communication protocol over USB and the Flash memory content are encrypted in order to avoid illegal copies between two systems of the same plugin. The inDSP boards are not open platforms, and, normally, only the plugins originally written by inDSP can be executed. However, a member of MIDIBox community has made a reverse engineering of the original hardware and has described a way to use the ASX/X-Synth as a low-cost platform for custom DSP code.http://midibox.org/forums/topic/18923-the-ng-and-the-dsp/?page=2 = ToneCore DSP = In January 2008, US company Line6 announced the launch of the ToneCore DSP Kit.http://be.line6.com/news/pressReleases/644 This kit takes the form of a guitar effect pedal, which contains a 24-bits Freescale DSP56364, running at 100 MHz. The DSP program is loaded by a micro-controller, in charge of the user interface and USB communication port. The DSP program for the ToneCore is written in assembly on PC, using an assembler provided with the ToneCore Development Kit. Even if the global hardware concept is very similar to the one used on Chameleon (DSP associated with a micro-controller for user interface and communication), it shall be noted that the micro-controller code can not be modified on the ToneCore, and is not available to the developer. Moreover, the ToneCore platform does not include MIDI interface. = HorusDSP = In March 2016, the French company BEB has presented an open DSP platform solution, dedicated to sound synthesis, called HorusDSP.http://www.imodular- synth.com The main hardware is built around a SigmaDSP ADAU1701. It is powered by Eurorack power supply backplane and includes a 5V converter for the controller board and a MIDI IN interface. The HorusDSP main board can be connected to different controllers: * KissBox RTP-MIDI OEM controller, with dedicated control software in it * MIDIBOX MBHP-NG with STM32F407 processor * Arduino Zero or Due (Uno and Mega2560 can also be used but their processing power in 32 bits is limiting the capabilities of the system) BEB proposes various firmware releases that can be run on the HorusDSP module, like dual harmonic oscillator, quad saw/square oscillator, filters, etc. Users can also create their own DSP programs, using the free SigmaStudio tool, available from Analog Devices. Once compiled in SigmaStudio, they can be downloaded via RTP- MIDI to the DSP. When MIDIBOX or Arduino control boards are used, it is possible for the user to write the complete control application. The control boards can also get access to the local MIDI port, and it is possible to create a complete custom user interface.
